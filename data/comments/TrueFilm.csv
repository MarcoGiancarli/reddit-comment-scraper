TrueFilm,3e43w1,DaGanzi,8,Tue Jul 21 20:22:19 2015 UTC,"This kind of list selection process is always going to bias itself towards the established classics.  With each critic only given 10 slots of movies to pick, there's not a lot of room to highlight too many overlooked masterpieces, and even if you do put a few on your list, its still high improbably that other critics will also pick it with their very limited allotted selection."
TrueFilm,3e43w1,RyanSmallwood,16,Tue Jul 21 21:09:48 2015 UTC,"Interesting if somewhat conventional list.  On the point about female directors I beleive that their exclusion should be viewed as a symptom of sexism rather than a part of it.  The same argument is often made about awards shows.  It's not that the critics or judges are (necessarily) themselves sexist, but they have so few films by female directors to choose from.  I hope that the success of female directors (and black directors) in recent years will open Hollywood up to backing a more diverse range of directors (thinking of Bigelow and McQueen)."
TrueFilm,3e43w1,penurious,4,Tue Jul 21 20:39:23 2015 UTC,"The other problem there is that it's specifically an American list. There are indisputably great female directors like Varda and Riefenstahl but none from America who are really treated that way. The Hurt Locker and Meek's Cutoff aren't lesser movies than The Dark Knight but they don't have significant cults either. Lost in Translation does but that kinda makes it the 'obvious one' along with The Piano for international lists. We Need to Talk About Kevin is even better than these but it was a sorta international production, not widely watched and isn't the sort of thing you see on lists with such banal ideas about what greatness is."

Many of his great films ran into censorship issues and he often just plowed ahead and filmed then anyway and the positive reception of his films slowly adjusted the censors to his more daring content.  Double Indemnity, The Long Weekend, Sunset Boulevard, Ace in the Hole, and The Apartment kept pushing the line, in spite of constant risk to his career stability.  The Long Weekend was initially a flop, but after it became a sleeper hit, he kept going, and even after the temporary setback of Ace in the Hole doing terribly at the box office, he went ahead and made The Apartment as soon as he was in good standing again from Some Like it Hot.  Aesthetically would probably be another huge discussion, but I'd just throw that he's been heavily influenced by two of my favorite German filmmakers of all time Ernst Lubitsch and the screenwriter Carl Mayer.  I don't always prefer his films over theirs, but its quite interesting to see Lubitsch's sense of comedy with a more cynical and socially critical streak to it.  He also arguably has the longest running stretch of masterpieces of any Writer-Director in the hollywood studio system."
TrueFilm,3e43w1,entertainman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:37:17 2015 UTC,Double indemnity took 8 years to make after the first script because they had to keep toning it down.  It was the opposite of plowed ahead.

Or is it just where the money is coming from and where the money ends up?  Because in my opinion, 12 years a slave, while based on an american book and telling a truly American story, is an international film.  The director is British with Irish, British and Mexican/Kenyan stars. But because Brad Pitt ponied up the cash, does that make it American?   Kubrick lived in England for the last 20 years of his life, filming in England and using a lot of English actors. Barry Lindon and A clockwork orange are as American as Morris Dancing."

The foremost reason is that it is extremely comprehensive in the depletion all of the sources and elements that together comprise the concept of honor. It does this while also building suspense on a two-way street, where you both have suspense to find out what and why something happened and also what will happen in a way that is clouded in excellent mystery. The cinematography might be more subjective, but to me there are many opportunites that allows you to screenshot and frame those stills. The symbolism of the empty set of armor, the criticism of the samurai code and the general historical insight it provides into 1830 Japan are amongst the things this movie is a top 250 movie."

To say any span of time is ""the best time in cinema"" s kind of hard to pin point. But I feel movies have gotten so much stronger in terms of effective story telling, and thrill rides. Yes, sometimes we get bad horror films like Ouji and paranormal 4, and we think back to the 80s when we got THE SHINING! Glory days. But you know, we also got toxic avenger right? We seem to forget about that. And today, some horror films are incredible. The babadook, is probably the most clever horror film since the shining!   In addition to action movies, since you are so inclined to praise them.. Mad Max... May just be the best action thrill ride of all time. Make it 4:3, black and white, and muted with only piano music... How many movies can you say from any era can still represent a valid story from just imagery in the way Mad Max does? 2001 you say? YES! It does! So doesn't that mean Mad Max should be ranked up there with 2001? YES!   Also, if you notice on the list another movie for example is the Dark Knight ranked 96. about 10 below it at 80 something is the original zombie movie night of the living dead. I mean come on, even you would probably admit those spots should be flip flopped, but why is night of the living dead ranked higher? Because it was revolutionary. The first of its kind. Its not better than the dark knight, its just... original. So why don't we have texas chainsaw? and original film that defined the slasher genre? That was original! It was a story that you can also make 4:3 turn black and white, and mute it.. You would get the same story from that. But with citizen kane.. you can't. Which explains a lot, because Orson welles came from theatre not cinema. Yes. He had invented so many spectacular shots. But the story cannot be conveyed if it was muted. Feel me?"
TrueFilm,3e43w1,Splagodiablo,3,Tue Jul 21 23:27:42 2015 UTC,Being an innovation in how movies are made I'm pretty sure does qualify Citizen Kane as one of the greatest films ever made.

TrueFilm,3e2g4m,henrythebrown,15,Tue Jul 21 13:10:04 2015 UTC,"I am going from a long ago recollection of this movie. I have seen it twice and it made more sense the second time.   SPOILERS BELOW!!!!  It was a weird film. The guy was just an ordinary postal worker with guys in demon masks trying to kill him. It's hard to tell if he's dreaming, he's crazy or it's real. That is the surface story.   Below that....  It is a story of angels, demons and their fight over human souls. This movie is full of biblical names and they really mean something. For instance, his girlfriend, Jezebel, (King Ahab's wife in the bible who changed his religion) is against church in general. So is Jacob, he says he 'sold his soul for a good lay'.   Some characters hint that he is dead (The palm reader, the doctor), others tell him he is alive (Louis). He wants to live and fights the 'evil' that is trying to kill him. Then his chiropractor, Louis, says this:   The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they're not punishing you, he said. They're freeing your soul. So, if you're frightened of dying and... and you're holding on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the earth. It's just a matter of how you look at it, that's all. So don't worry, okay?   This tells me that Jacob is in hell right now. His life working for the post office isn't real. It is a convenient construct so that he can talk to his tormenters. This is when the perception of what is an angel and what is a demon changes for him. His demons, (including Jezzie) are trying to get him to let go of life so that he can go on to the next life. The angels want him to live, to keep suffering. Why? Maybe because he has turned his back on God.   I believe that Louis is an angel and he has given Jacob this information so that a choice can be made. He's given up on Jacob. In the end, the demons win. Jacob wins. He is no longer suffering.  The drug comment is something I didn't like either but could have been there to keep the religious people from protesting a movie that shows angels and God doing evil things. That is not what's happening in my opinion. It could be that a religious man would be helped to death by angels encouraging him to release his sins and the demons making him suffer to get him to sin. A final battle all face as they die.  I would have to ask you, what WOULD be the right way to end this movie?"

TrueFilm,3e2g4m,EndlessN,13,Tue Jul 21 23:42:27 2015 UTC,"Well, you have to also take in to account when this movie was made, this ending was way more original and therefor unexpected, which resulted in much higher appreciation.

TrueFilm,3e2g4m,screwikea,3,Tue Jul 21 15:26:29 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS (This whole thread is, though, really.)  This should really be the top answer. When it came out (1990), Vietnam was still very fresh in the minds of a lot of adults who could remember the Vietnam era very clearly. We were also on the tail end of some really well respected Vietnam War films (Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Born on the Fourth of July), and in the middle of it having pop culture usage in films (ex: Casualties of War). The idea of the lead being dead the whole time was a unique and underused concept, but that wasn't the selling point for the movie because... well, kind of the twist, right?  It's real selling point was this kind of Wes Craven-y, Serpent and the Rainbow vibe. The weird, horror aspect was a bigger draw for a younger audience, the Vietnam related material was a bigger draw for an older demographic, and ""From the Director of Fatal Attaction"" pulled interest from the female-centric slasher crowd."
TrueFilm,3e2g4m,lobster_johnson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:30:33 2015 UTC,"I think all of those qualities are what made the film so great, doesn't matter to me what films were made after, it's just how they executed the ending. Literally after he walks up the stairs with his son and it fades to white, it's then that the film spells it out to you and ruins any chance to interpret the ending. It kills the emotional high point of the film for me. The whole film seems to be his subjective emotional view on events and his past; why jump out of his head to clarify everything? Why explain that the government did test drugs? It would be better left to interpretation, but they end the film in explanatory text that spells it out. For a film that is so abstract in it's form and nature, it sure does have a patronizing final scene."
TrueFilm,3e2g4m,MomoTheCow,7,Tue Jul 21 23:47:27 2015 UTC,"One interpretation (consistently supported by the events in the film) is that it's not a dream; Jacob is in Purgatory, trying to find his way to Heaven. Throughout the film, Jacob is visited by demonic (eg., the horned being raping his wife at the party, or the eyeless surgeons) and angelic (his chiropractor, his dead son) figures.  The screenwriter, Bruce Joel Rubin, is/was rather obsessed with the idea of an afterlife; his other well-known films, Ghost and Brainstorm, are also about this theme. The title is from the Bible, with Jacob dreaming of a ladder going to Heaven:   Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, ""Surely the Lord is in this place; and I did not know it."" And he was afraid, and said, ""This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.   The Christian symbolism in the film is pretty overt, but it is of course ambiguous."
TrueFilm,3e2g4m,Miguelito-Loveless,4,Tue Jul 21 17:55:16 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, and don't really get why they chose to put that in the film (except maybe give more literal-minded viewers a more tangible basis for the plot).   It overrides the tone of the film and even sabotages the themes by turning Jacob's journey and struggle, and eventual inner peace, into just a really bad acid trip. I suspect it might have been a studio edit like adding the voiceover into Blade Runner was."
TrueFilm,3e2g4m,WiretapStudios,3,Tue Jul 21 15:48:43 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you on the tension in the film.  I thought the film defied expectations by starting out very suspenseful, and then slowly losing the suspense/horror qualities. And I am not criticizing that approach. I have seen 1,000 films that get more suspenseful, so it was nice to see one go from suspense/horror ambiance to the feel of a drama at the end.  As for the end, think on this; the ""dream"" he has involves him seeing cars (and probably other things as well) that were only released after he supposedly died. So if it was all a dream, how did those anachronisms get into his dream? So does the film maker really require the viewer to accept that the events were a dream, or is the door left open that something else is going on?   Some went into this film wanting to see a plot-centric film, but these people realized at the ending that the film was actually character-centric (as the plot elements might have been part of a dream or a hallucination).    As /u/EndlessN said, even if you were upset by the way the early part of the film was undercut by the ending, the film was interesting because it explored the psychology of the protagonist.  Now there are films that end with the ""it's a dream"" ending (SPOILER coming up), and most of the time that ending does ruin the film.  Paul McCartney's Give My Regards to Broadstreet wasn't a great film to begin with, but the ""it's a dream"" ending made it shittier than it had to be."

What you wrote here, and him dying on the table are not mutually exclusive. Sometimes you perceive time slowing down, sometimes it's faster. Who is to say he isn't allowed to perceive everything quoted above in just a few hours at the end of his life?"
TrueFilm,3e2g4m,guilen,2,Tue Jul 21 17:52:01 2015 UTC,"I LOVED that movie and HATED that title card. Seriously, it undercut every thing we just saw. Everything. Basically it was classic ""occurrence at owl creek bridge"" plot; where everything you've seen in the movie turns out to be what was going through his mind in the last moments of his life. (also loved Elizabeth Pena in it; it's so sad she died this year).  So presumably the crazy drug testing etc was just a manifestation of his fever dream final thoughts... then that stupid title card pops up.  An interesting thing about Jacob's ladder: If you go back and read contemporaneous reviews; they generally fall into two camps: they loved it or hated it; very very little in-between. But if you read the ""hated"" it reviews, it's completely clear that a huge portion of them never realized that the film was his ""dying dream"". They just plain missed it.  I love movie that play with these death dream scenarios. If you watch Birdman pretty closely it's clear, at least to me, that the vast majority of the film is a death dream going through his brain... But it could be seen as appropriately other was as well.  But to answer your question:   Was this the right way to end the movie?   Hell no."
TrueFilm,3e2g4m,patrickc11,2,Tue Jul 21 21:14:56 2015 UTC,"I can't agree with you, because the ending describes what the entire film is in a very creative way. I know I'm not the only one saying this, but it can't hurt to reinforce it. His life wasn't an hallucination or a dream - he died with an unclear soul and was being given the opportunity to determine the moral polarity of his soul before he truly passed on. Somebody here called it purgatory, I think that's the right notion. Surely, this suggests some kind of religious tone to the film which is far more at home in the time when the film came out, but seeing how the forces of light and dark (lame descriptor but you know what I mean) are vying to influence him starts to make a kind of sense. Personally, I thought it was a perfect ending in that it defined the mystery of the plot, the very nature of the film itself. If all you got out of it was ""it was all a dream"" I think you missed what was going on. Or you just don't go in for all that afterlife stuff... hey man, either way."

TrueFilm,3e1aw6,mybachhurts,7,Tue Jul 21 04:48:23 2015 UTC,"I think While We’re Young is fantastic because it doesn’t give you the fantasy ending you want. Some movies are wish fulfillment, but I feel like that isn’t the goal of this movie. There are going to be successful people that we can’t stand, who we know are jerks. If we dwell on it we will only become bitter.   Josh (Ben Stiller) at the end of the film has changed into a richer person and made the difficult transition into being comfortable in his adult life. This is the core story of the film. All of us are going to make the difficult transition from our Mid-twenties into our thirties. I know alot of people in their thirties, and beyond, who are still chasing some dream of being the cool youthful person they were.  It’s just sad to see people still hanging out at the bar every night with their life stalled. You can be a cool person in your thirties it just isn’t going to be the same person you were in your twenties. This is an incredibly hard subject matter to talk about and this film did a great job on it.   As for Jamie  (Adam Driver), we see this character a lot more in books than film, and they can be particularly dangerous in real life. My favorite term for this type of person is psychic vampires. They feed off other people's energy and have a charisma that can get others to follow them/ start thinking like them. Yeah, Jamie is a dick, but in a result driven world he is still getting things done. We would like to believe that we live in a fair time where good triumphs over evil, but  how come so many asshats have done well for themselves? Perhaps success is a moving target and the ruthless are willing to do whatever it takes to make it work.   In the creative and business world there are going to be people who have burnt you. You will drive yourself crazy if you can’t get past it. Also if you can’t take away any life lessons from being burnt than you are not growing as a person.   Like The Squid and The Whale, While We’re Young is a complicated movie that lends itself to being re-watched. People are complicated, life is complicated, yet here we are trying to find our own happiness in the mess we have been given. Josh went through a personality crisis, changed a lot as a person, all while keeping his marriage together. He has earned a new deeper understanding of love, family and his work.   As for Jamie, who cares about him?  He will change or be forever alone in his own narcissism. In the crudest of terms, Jamie's arc is that he can go fuck himself."
TrueFilm,3e1aw6,ChaseDFW,4,Tue Jul 21 14:27:27 2015 UTC,"I think this was very well written aside from the last two lines. Baumbach ends up making Jamie into a very interesting character due to his narcissism and his belief that he hasn't done anything wrong. The way he, and others at the end of the film, act as though his stance on life is to be applauded instead of ridiculed is both infuriating and devastatingly real at the same time.   But ""As for Jamie, who cares about him?""...I kinda do. We've seen the insecure, pretentious documentary maker come to terms with his ageing and outlook on life, imagine revisiting this guy who, as he reaches a similar age, will look back on his life and question whether it was ever authentic or not. Baumbach's protagonists, more often than not, are clueless, naive, full of goodness and just a little narcisstic. It would be nice for him to explore a truly vindictive and tasteless character who suddenly becomes hyper aware of their own immorality...a character like Jamie."
TrueFilm,3e1aw6,hydra815,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:33:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't feel that the story was about Jamie. Baumbach's choice to end the movie with Kent's realization of Jamie's character seemed like the best indication that it was about Kent all along.   I think that was the biggest misdirection. He compelled was to want justice, but what we got wasn't injustice. Instead we found out that justice didn't matter. That Kent's growth is more important than Jamie's fortune.  That is a much more internal and superficially less satisfying arc. As an audience we wanted that scene at the Awards to pay off for Kent. It's grand and dramatic. Personal growth is a lot less showy, but so is Baumbach."
TrueFilm,3e1odg,GeoT-rex,11,Tue Jul 21 07:21:17 2015 UTC,"People keep watching them because there are always new teenagers growing up.  Say the core audience for these (R rated) comedies is about a 6 year window from 16-22.  And Apatow puts out 1 a year... that means every time he puts out a movie almost 20% of his core viewer base is experiencing an Apatow movie for the first time.  They fall in love, watch a few more over the next few years thinking they are the greatest thing ever, and then they eventually move on.  But by the time they move on, there's already an entirely new crop of kids who are now into the films.  None of this is new to Apatow - these types of comedies have been going strong for over 30 years.  Animal House was 1978.  All of that said, I do think nearly everybody can enjoy a good comedy every now and again, and Apatow (at his best) can be pretty good.  Not many outside that core age bracket could sit there and plow through his entire catalogue in a month, but I can enjoy it once in a while."

TrueFilm,3e1odg,crocodile_cloud,7,Tue Jul 21 15:07:41 2015 UTC,I would say Apatow is the John Hughes of this generation.  Which one you find better probably correlates highly to how old you are.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Apatow's movies and his humor, and agree that he is currently the best in business today. But clearly Hughes movies continue to resonate with audiences, young and old. While Apatow does engage universal fears and human foibles in his writing, I think his heavy reliance on dick jokes and bong humor will prevent his movies from receiving the 'beloved movie' status that Hughes films acquired.   And I agree with you - I was too old for Sandler movies and never enjoyed them.

I think you're undercutting him a bit, but more on point, the average fan doesn't enjoy these movies for the depth.  They enjoy them for simplicity, humor, and nostalgia.  They're all made to be feel good films, and they all do a pretty good job at that.    Something like Pineapple Express might be a forgotten film because of the incessant pot humor, but Forgetting Sarah Marshall is as timeless as anything Hughes put out.

If so, you're looking at so-called ""buddy comedies,"" with occasional forays into ""cringe comedy."" They also often dip into ribaldry and stoner humor. I can't speak to why we keep watching them - probably because humans have liked buddy stories for centuries, they're fundamental to us - but the reason there are so many right now is because they're profitable and relatively easy to create.   Two friends! They. Uh. SOMETHING WEIRD HAPPENS. Okay, throw in some dirty jokes, a drug joke or five, and find a way to make it 90 minutes long. That's the end of the writing process for most of these films. The market for them is mostly teenagers, with short attention spans, an interest in the risque and uncouth, a desire to see movies about friends staying friends (as they near the end of high school or college), and most importantly a relatively large amount disposable income with few financial responsibilities compared to adults."

TrueFilm,3dxzxp,FullClockworkOddessy,29,Mon Jul 20 13:35:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with the majority of what you've presented, although I'm not sure if I'd use Funny Games and American Psycho as your go-to options for realistic serial killers. Funny Games is meant to be a social commentary that intends to chide the audience for their bloodlust rather than focus on the killers, hence why the killers get no back-story. It just wouldn't have worked in context. I do think Haneke has some films that are great examples of the ambiguity in some humans' need to harm or even kill; Benny's Video comes to mind.  I also feel the same way about American Psycho. The film is a satire, and what is implied about whom Bateman kills, if anyone, is a great topic of conversation, but because of the social commentary being presented first and foremost, it leaves any curiosity over Bateman's motives (which I actually think are pretty clearly spelled out if you look at the context of the film) secondary.  I like your example of Peeping Tom, and I'd like to recommend you give Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer a try if you haven't seen it yet. It by far is the most realistic look into the life of a serial killer without examining motives that I have seen, other than the idea that we all might have a bit of this in us.  Anyway, yes, I think you are absolutely right that Hollywood goes out of its way to explain the motives or history of killers; even some of my favorite non-Hollywood directors (see Sion Sono, Cold Fish) give a little too much away, whether it's for us to sympathize with them or in the interest of the writer's or director's own agenda. I think in the end, the vast majority of audiences will be frustrated by ambiguity over closure, and that third-act exposition you talk about is a safe way to give people that closure to spread positive word of mouth rather than walk away to tell all their friends a movie was ""pointless.""  EDIT: I'd also like to point out that Fincher all but named the killer at the end of Zodiac, likely because he knew how audiences would react. I feel this weakened the movie considerably and was a poor decision based on the true crime the movie was based upon."
TrueFilm,3dxzxp,no_modest_bear,11,Mon Jul 20 15:52:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree that Fincher all but named the killer.  I would argue he included that scene as a stand-in for audience members and people in real life, who feel the need to provide resolution for themselves even if the facts/the film don't provide a clear-cut one.  He intentionally undercuts this with the coda of the film saying that the facts don't line up for what Gyllenhaal chose to believe, but it makes it no less a valid conclusion for Gyllenhaal to have come to."
TrueFilm,3dxzxp,find_my_harborcoat,5,Mon Jul 20 18:11:34 2015 UTC,"That's very fair, and I do suppose I worded that inappropriately. You said it right as providing a stand-in for those who wanted resolution. I remember being disappointed that he did that, but I may me overestimating the scene's significance to the film. I do think that it was a bookend, though, for those that wanted closure, which was my original point. Then again, Fincher isn't exactly a genre director, so catering to the mainstream while still making serviceable to great films is his job.  Speaking of resolution, that coincidentally reminded me of the film Resolution, which is as much a horror film as a film about stepping into adulthood from two polar opposite perspectives. It also touches on filmmaking from a meta level and has some of the best screenwriting (or impressive improvisation) I've seen in ages. It's actually a great fit for this discussion (for reasons of like to avoid due to spoilers), but if you're familiar with Spring (by Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead), Resolution is their first feature.

TrueFilm,3dxzxp,no_modest_bear,14,Wed Jul 22 00:05:09 2015 UTC,"We will never have concise and definitive explanations for why people like Jeffrey Dahmer or Richard Ramirez did what they did. The best we can do are educated guesses, that could for all we know be completely off the mark   That's kind of true for anything; not just serial killers. I generally agree with your well-thought out and argued premise; but I think movies that explore why certain serial killers are the way they are can be terrific (I'm thinking specifically of ""moster"" with charlize theron... a fairly good movie was an astonishingly good performance).  I'll tell you one thing though, my cousin is a serial killer; she's currently in prison, scheduled for release in like 3-4 years. There is no movie I've ever seen the portrayed the nuances and weirdness of something like her story; but there would really be no way to tell her story without pretty much exclusively trying to focus on the ""why"".  Her story is like many stories out that that people don't immediately think of as ""serial killer"" because of a steady diet that hollywood teaches us about what a ""real"" serial killer is. She mistreated a woman who was living with her and her family so poorly that the woman died... my nephew witnessed her dealing with the aftermath, and when my cousin found out a few months later, she made her ex-husband murder my nephew... then about ten years later she was helping care for two different older people and murdered both of them; likely for money from inheritances. Definitely a serial killer; but unlike anything I've ever seen in hollywood; whether or not that's a good thing.  I mean as a pure vehicle for generating tension; not focusing on the why can be powerful (like in zodiac; to my mind the best movie ever made about a serial killer). But it's not the only way to make a powerful movie about a serial killer."

TrueFilm,3dxzxp,mykunos,10,Tue Jul 21 19:05:31 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference between real-life and fictional serial killers, however, is the extent to which they are organized. Serial murderers are traditionally divided into 'organized' and 'disorganized' offenders not because this is a productive way to think about them -- it usually isn't -- but because that's the thing you can see at the crime scene. ...  ...Not only are serial murderers in fiction vastly more organized than serial murderers in real life, but there is almost no overlap between the groups. One can almost say accurately that every serial murderer in fiction is more organized than any serial murderer in real life.  I remember a 1970s made-for-TV movie about a serial killer; somebody is strangling women, and the police are trying to figure out who. They look for what the women have in common, and eventually they find it: they all had the same doctor when they were born, 20 years ago. They go after the doctor, only it turns out it isn't the doctor, it's the doctor's wife. She gave birth to a baby girl who was born dead about that time, strangled on the umbilical cord, and she is psychotically re-enacting this tragedy with her murders.  It's too rational, too organized. Real serial murderers don't have a clearly identifiable reason for their crimes. In Silence of the Lambs Thomas Harris creates a serial murderer, Hannibal Lecter, who is 50 times more organized, more in control of his actions, than any real-life serial murderer. But even Harris' backup serial murderer, Buffalo Bill Gumb, kills women for an easily identifiable reason: he wants their skin. Sexually confused, he is trying to make a 'woman suit' for himself by trapping large girls, starving them so their skin is loose, then killing them and using their skin to make a suit in which he can be a woman. It's too logical, too organized. Real serial murderers aren't that organized. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is closer to real life.   -- Bill James, ""Popular Crime"""
TrueFilm,3dxzxp,hipsterparalegal,7,Mon Jul 20 18:04:13 2015 UTC,"I think you might have something there, but it doesn't seem like its specific to serial killers. I think the same could be said about all villains, but I think it is especially true when talking about a slasher. I felt like Hannibal Lecter was almost defanged when Thomas Harris revealed his motive (In Hannibal). He went from viciously inscrutable to sympathetically traumatized. Compare to SeVen, where we never even learn Kevin Spacey's name. Sure, we know what John Doe's doing, but never why, and it remains much creepier.  The most recent science suggests that serial killers are the result of a confluence of neurological, psychological, and enviromental factors. People are born as psychopaths, their brain wired in such a way that they lack empathy, are highly intelligent, and constantly seeking ever increasing amounts of stimulus. Psychologically, they feel both superior and distant from other people, like they are both above and apart from the world. Many of these people move into high ranking positions, naturally attracted to power and autonomy. They become CEOs, surgeons, and politicians. They are smart, they have studied human nature, they know how to manipulate people. Only a tiny fraction of those people end up ever killing. Sometimes they have childhood trauma, sometimes not. They kill because of the adrenaline rush of breaking a taboo, because they think they're smarter than society. Many times it's that hubris that brings them down.  There are also many other types of serial murder, but the ""stalk-kill"", ritual murder kind is the one most portrayed in Hollywood. The point is that, like you said, in reality motives are rarely, if ever, revealed, and it remains much creepier."

TrueFilm,3dxzxp,rough_outline,6,Tue Jul 21 00:43:21 2015 UTC,"The thing is that much like how explaining the punchline makes a joke less funny, explaining the horrific makes it less scary.   That's just a problem ALL horror films struggle with.  When you build a fascinating character (the monster is always the most fascinating character), the number one thing you want to do is investigate all aspects of that character in the narrative.  It takes great discipline to hold back and leave the character ambiguous for the sake of suspense and horror.  At the same time, you can't just allow the character to act randomly for the same reason - if the audience feels that the character's actions are meaningless, it takes away the suspense that comes from being able to anticipate the looming threat.  My go-to example of a film that strikes the best balance between understanding and ambiguity is Jaws.  In Jaws, information about sharks and why shark attacks happen slowly trickles in.  By the third act, the viewer believes they have a vague but solid understanding of shark motivation.  Then the third act undermines all of it.  The shark in Jaws doesn't follow the normal shark rules.  Building a safety net for the audience to cling to, and then cutting it out from under them, is a great horror strategy that serves the double-purpose of avoiding tired psychoanalysis without ignoring the fact that humans seek explanation."

While it's debatable whether this film really belongs in the serial killer horror/thriller category, it definitely fits your description of an ideal villain. One of the central themes of the film is the investigators' inability to fully comprehend and accept the seemingly pointless violence perpetrated by the killer, and the film does not get any satisfying conclusion. You might even say it skips that third act and the exposition that goes with it. The end result is a kind of alien, otherworldly antagonist, not ""scary"" in the traditional sense, but frightening on a truly existential level."

I think, on a larger scope, most Coen villains have this quality in some form or another. You never quite find out their origin, or in some cases their motives. Fargo (and the TV spinoff, though it's not directly a Coen creation), Barton Fink, hell even Aloysius in the Hudsucker Proxy... the whole universe is filled with villains - and heroes even - of mysterious origin, and paradoxically it makes them more realistic."
TrueFilm,3dxzxp,Schadenfreudian_slip,5,Tue Jul 21 03:19:37 2015 UTC,"I'd say Angst is more realistic (and bleak) than most of the films you cited, yet it gives a fairly realistic explanation of the killer's drive to kill. That explanation does not come in the form of a backstory though -- it's simply a revelation of how killing affects the killer's state of mind.  The producer of Angst did add a backstory prologue to increase the 77 minute running time, but that sequence weakens the film. It's rightly missing from most versions aside from a old VHS release.  So generally I'd agree that a backstory isn't desirable, but ideally there are other methods to provide motivations for the brutality."
TrueFilm,3dxzxp,NitratePrint,5,Mon Jul 20 16:00:22 2015 UTC,"I really like the way the Hannibal tv show chose to navigate Hannibal's backstory. The showrunner said he didn't like the simplification of Hannibal through the backstory, but he still wanted to include content from the books. In the most recent season, there's a scene where someone specifically asks Hannibal ""What happened to you [in the past], that you can't go back anymore?"" and he says, ""Nothing. I happened."" This way they were able to include his backstory and give him a past, while at the same time refrained from making his past an explanation for his actions. They were adding to his complexity, rather than subtracting.   I don't think giving a character a backstory is an issue, as long as it's not portrayed as the sole reason for a character to do something. The issue with the Hannibal backstory wasn't that he had a traumatic childhood incident-it was that one incident was framed as the sole reason for his actions. No one in real life has one single event that completely explains ""the way that they are."" People are complex.   This applies to all characters, not just serial killers."
TrueFilm,3dxzxp,lasersaurous,3,Mon Jul 20 20:48:11 2015 UTC,"This is a great analysis. I am a fan of the supernatural horror stories, and to me a monster is scarier if you don't know why they're doing what they're doing.    Understanding their motivations humanizes and allows empathy. I don't want to empathize with the killer, I want to be afraid of him.   A great example would be 'Snowtown', wherein the antagonist is quite a charmer, but we discover his twisted sense of justice and fun without any rationalization behind it--you simply fear his wrath, anger, and irrational hatred.    Thanks!"
TrueFilm,3dxzxp,ReckoningGotham,2,Mon Jul 20 15:21:25 2015 UTC,"I think part of what you're getting at here (with the last scene of H's 'Psycho being' a primo example) - is this larger theme of just how far explanations of psychotic behavior - be it scientific, socioeconomic, or whathaveyou - how far they go to de-normalize killers, and therefore keep him/her at a distance from us. But let's take the opposite approach in movies. Some killings, in horror films for example, go completely unexplained. And that approach - or at least to me - can really feel flat, as if some thought or piece of final originality is missing ('the Strangers' from some years ago comes to mind). These kinds of killers might as well be of the FreddyKruger/monster/freak variety that you described, though they're supposedly human. So then, maybe, what makes Bateman / Peter & Paul so effective at thrilling or horrifying or fulfilling us withouT exact background or overt psychoanalysis is that all their behavior is still somehow, recognizably Human. So, then, the explanations or at least correlations for what they do ARE all around us - in our actual world. And that's really discomforting. Or scary. And this is what I take both 'American Psycho' and 'Funny Games' to really be about. Namely, the human aggression - if not, plain violence - lying dormant beneath the most fine, pristine and expensive of human exteriors. That these exteriors have blood beneath them. In the case of Haneke, it's also wrapped up, I'd say, in an comment about the audience's own desires for violence onscreen, funny enough. I think he wants to point us to our own desire for watching killing done in a packaged manner, on screen - and therefore not to really see that violence is in us - underneath us even. Or otherwise, to think about what puts you in common with a killer - serial or otherwiss. That is, he Being human (not merely a monster) and you being in the same society, too."

TrueFilm,3dxzxp,DrEmilioLazardo,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:31 2015 UTC,"Not a cinema example, but I am reminded of a wonderful episode of The X-Files in which a serial killer, wanting to understand his motives, visits (and, at the end of each session, kills) a string of phony psychics and fortune tellers. Eventually, he meets a man who does actually possess the gift of prescience, and they have the following exchange:  The Killer: ""There's something I've been wanting to ask you for some time now. You've seen the things I do in the past as well as in the future.""  Clyde Bruckman: ""They're terrible things.""  The Killer: ""I know they are. So tell me, please, why have I done them?""  Clyde Bruckman: ""Don't you understand yet son? Don't you get it?"" [The Killer shakes his head] ""You do the things you do because you're a homicidal maniac.""  The Killer: ""That... that does explain a lot, doesn't it. It's all starting to make sense now.""  To answer your question, I think you've hit the nail on the head. It's comforting to think it's nurture, not nature, that makes us who we are, but, throughout history, there have been many well documented cases of extremely sadistic individuals whose behavior simply can not be explained by anything in their personal history. It's those kinds of fictional villains, too, that tend to scare the shit out of me."
TrueFilm,3dxzxp,hadrijana,4,Tue Jul 21 10:22:43 2015 UTC,"I feel as though a common thread of the psychobabble info-dump in these films is to frame the killer as a product of our society or our times. It's not necessarily an attempt to remove responsibility from the killer or make them grounded and predictable in light of some scientific classification or theory. Killer/stalker films are often organized around a very conservative moral worldview, either in the voice of the writer or in the actions of the killer. The people that get killed are often overtly promiscuous, users of drugs, etc. Sinners. Modern urbanites. Stand-ins for and of progressive social movements. If anything, these infodumps serve as attempts to make some connection between the societal shifts and the targets of the killer. For better or worse, the state of the world is a certain way or society has changed its view on some thing. The killer is a violent reaction to that changed world, or a casualty or product of it.  These info-dumps seem to serve as a way to put the monster back in the box at the end. However, the fact that the killer conforms to some well understood mental or behavioral theory suggests that there have been and perhaps will be many, many more of them."

TrueFilm,3dxzxp,Black_Belt_Troy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:11:40 2015 UTC,"I agree that keeping motives a secret to the audience makes the serial killer scarier but I do have to say that sometimes the ""third exposition,"" as you call it, serves a different purpose other than simply explaining the killer's motives. Sometimes the third exposition is used to reveal the ingenuity of the killer or of the mastermind, in order to awe the audience. If this effect is done right (which is most often not the case) it leaves audiences shocked at the evil genius of the killer. A viewer who sees clearly into a fucked up person's mind will be just as scared as if he has no clue into what that mind is like. I can't think of any good examples that utilize this effect correctly at the top of my head, but I do remember being scared at leaving a theater with the mind of a serial killer. I'm pretty sure Silence of the Lambs did this pretty well. Overall, I really liked your critique, I've never really noticed that part of the horror movie before in which ""the punchline is explained."""
TrueFilm,3dxzxp,SamuraiSam100,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:13:52 2015 UTC,"I think it's more about what the filmmaker is going for. In most Genre Thrillers/Horrors the audience expects everything resolve neatly, thus clear logical motives to kill and bad guy caught.  However if it's less of genre piece filmmakers will feel freer to explore those themes of ambiguity and the unknown, an innate drive toward violence. Allowing the killer to get away, unorganized unpatterned kills."

TrueFilm,3dz9ae,undeadzombie12,15,Mon Jul 20 19:04:55 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Woody Allen's best work is more universal than Noah Baumbach's. Woody Allen, in works like Annie Hall and Manhattan, though capturing ""the times"", transcends its setting and has moments of ever resonating humor and pathos.  Now I'm a Frances Ha supporter. I know this movie polarizes viewers, but I think it's a great film. I also think it's Baumbach's best film, certianly better than While We're Young. Still, however, the movie spends a lot of time wrestling with the rising generation, and where its place in the annals of humor and drama rest. I think we're still there. The idiosyncrasy of the current generation (in terms of technology, zeitgeist, etc) hasn't, in my opinion, been properly compensated for in film yet. Frances Ha is a remarkable attempt, but doesn't understand the present well enough to stand against it and resonate outside of it, like Annie Hall does.  But hey, Noah Baumbach is pretty damn close to Woody Allen. I'll keep an eye out for similarities for now on."

Where as the conversations and dialogue in Allen's earlier films have much more broad applications to everyday life of many people."

Everything after that (except maybe Mr. Jealousy) is much more advanced and developed.  With Allen, I feel like Manhattan was really the only early movie he made that I liked or felt accessible, as I did not really like Annie Hall (for reasons that I won't get into here).

Admirable perhaps, but not terribly fascinating.  It's far more intriguing to explore a character who is undergoing some form of redemption. In literary and film analysis, we often talk about 'character arc'. How much of an arc can a 'genuinely good' character honestly have? If he starts out a good guy and ends up still a good guy, what opportunity does he have to evolve and transform?  Jean Valjean and Terry Malloy are simply more interesting as characters than their priests. As in Parable of the Prodigal Son, the repentant sinner is more cherished than the man who never sinned in the first place.  As a side note, it may interest you to know that the character of Father Barry was based on the real-life 'Waterfront Priest' Father John Corridan."

TrueFilm,3dvjmm,kamateur,119,Sun Jul 19 21:52:54 2015 UTC,"I definitely think that the lack of restrictions in modern cinematography (a modern big-budget film can really mimic any type of shot the creative powers behind the film can conceive of) has, like many other things, resulted in a genericized sort of cinematography which increasingly seems to lack an auteur's voice or behind-the-camera perspective.  For example, Paul Greengrass popularized the use of shaky cam to create a sensation of the audience being present in a chaotic action scene. He employed it in the Bourne trilogy and United 93, and at the time it felt visceral and daring in a big-budget film. Since then, however, it's become a part of the language of cinema, and is in my opinion overused, and something more discerning moviegoers have been tired of for long enough that John Wick's and Fury Road's long, sustained action scenes feel fresh today.  The type of camera movement you're talking about feels pretty damn ubiquitous as well, and I feel like it hit the mainstream with J. J. Abram's 2009's Star Trek film, which used the sweeping, circling camera movement toward a purpose: the Star Trek reboot's cinematography made the subtextual point that we were watching something new and futuristic, and I'm convinced deliberately set itself up against the more sterile, static camera angles often associated with Star Trek as a franchise (I don't hold this view, if it matters). Now, everybody does it, and often toward no particular purpose.  I think any technique is valid if used intentionally, toward a specific purpose and with knowledge of what that purpose is. But if a technique is part of a filmmaker's vocabulary, it's disappointing to see it used more like a word the user doesn't know the definition for (or a kid retelling a joke they heard an adult say moments earlier and trying to get the same laugh). So yes, while I think it's a part of a broader problem, a lot of modern filmmaking seems to overmove the camera, and for those of us who grew up with a little more deliberacy in filmmaking, it can be exhausting, even if you don't account for the fact that a film which pulls from a cinematographic template often takes similar shortcuts with its writing, thematic material and characterization."

There's no need to copy the entire page of release notes and throw every single one into your edit, when 99% of the time the basic features are more than enough for the purpose.

After that every filmmaking was doing it to make their action scenes ""more realistic"" (like the abysmal shaky cam action scenes in Gladiator).  The thing is, the shaky cam was done in Private Ryan to mimic the actual combat footage taken during World War II. It was more realistic because it matched actual documentation (and consequently our memories of WWII as viewed on film). There's no real reason to use shaky cam for any old action movie - and that's the real problem. Filmmakers moving the camera without reason.    You'll also notice in Private Ryan the camera sits still for the important stuff so you can follow what's going on. The shaky cam is just used to add to the confusion of combat. And shaky cam isn't used for the whole dang movie, which is where Greengrass really fails. A simple dialogue scene shouldn't be nauseating, and his cameraman needs to sober up.  tl;dr: I'd like to buy every filmmaker I know a tripod."

But the problem of using a tool constantly is it loses it's impact, it just becomes meaningless. It's like using too many close ups or shaky cam, they'll lose their impact, so when you want to draw attention to something very important with a C.U. or emphasis the drama with shake, it no longer works because you've desensitized your viewer to it.   Same with movement, in that it can be used to create meaning or emotion. If we become desensitized to it, the film maker has used up that tool.

Now I wouldn't go so far as to say that the hyperactive editing in some recent blockbusters are perfect, but they're a mixed bag. I love the Bourne series. Even though it essentially made shaky cam trendy, it works for those films. On the opposite spectrum we have somebody like Malick doing all kinds of experimental and off kilter things visually but I dare say it also works quite well.  The spirit of the day seems to be that American action blockbusters are to be disorientating and I wouldn't say it's inherently inferior, just used sloppily a lot of the time. See Transformers for the most extreme example. As I said, there are cases which work. Marvel basically captures the childhood joy of banging together action figures in a lot of their movies.  Oppositely, watch a film like Captain America: The Winter Soldier for the best stunt work and 90s action throwback that Marvel has in its arsonal. I haven't seen Ant Man but I suspect its editing has a lot to do with the way they use the hero's powers to alter the scale of the world. Maybe it's supposed to be dizzying?"

One doesn't have to worry about space or the 2D when the camera is almost literally flying everywhere.  However, the ""flying camera"" is a staple of the modern spectacle of film.

I never have a problem with well-motivated camera movement, in everything from Birdman to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

TrueFilm,3dvjmm,imquez,10,Mon Jul 20 13:11:33 2015 UTC,"I just want to add that there is another factor in the comic book movies that actually deters the use of framing on the same artistic level as the classics, which is that these films are becoming more and more like television shows. The older films were shot with the clear intention that they were standalone pieces, and the director was taking advantage of every single element of the film to express his vision. The level of framing, editing and cinematography is tightly symbiotic with the story, its aim to reach a poetic level of expression. But the bad news is that, you can't consistently execute on that high artistic level in a continuing series.  On the other extreme, vanilla TV shows are usually shot by numbers, i.e., the camera, lighting, and position are pretty much preset so that as a series, its look and feel are consistent, and it reduces production overhead. The Marvel movies, as well as franchises like Harry Potter and LOTR, are trying to incorporate an overarching level of visual direction so that if you were to buy the complete set in the future, you can view them all at once with a better sense of continuity. The filmmakers are aware of that limitation and work within it to be as creative as possible, but at the same time, they are aware that these movies will have never achieve the type of cinematic artistry as standalone movies can.  On another side note, Michael is perfectly aware of his criticisms, but he is also extremely acute of managing people's expectations. The Transformers could have been better, the characters and dialogs could have better, and so forth. However, Michael Bay at heart never truly believed he could make a compelling movie about giant robots transforming into cars, so if he were to put in 'serious' or 'artistic' elements, it would have raised the audience's expectations, and Bay would have pigeonholed himself into a potential franchise dead end."

I think both of these are poor examples.  Harry Potter's look and feel changed from film to film. Even Hogwarts itself was different from film to film. All 3 LOTR films on the other hand were shot at the same time under the same director and production team."
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,IAmLuckyDuckling,5,Sun Jul 19 23:09:26 2015 UTC,"Take a look at the cinematography in Thor and you almost wonder how it was allowed to be so beautiful. Everything post-Avengers just looks so generic, it really turns me off.  It's kind of a shame. At least the DC films look like films. Whatever quality or lack thereof aside.  Full disclosure: I am a mod for /r/DC_Cinematic."
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,imquez,4,Mon Jul 20 16:20:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like what DC is doing now is more or less ""go with what's working' and that's currently Zach Snyder's vision. I don't know if that's going to be their visual for a while or not. I personally prefer if they can replicate Alex Ross's rendition of DC heroes in their films in the future, the hyper-kinetic version of Norman Rockwell's visions. DC approach to me has always been more mythological and timeless, while Marvel tends to be more contemporary and relevant to current pop culture and social references."
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,Flubby2,4,Mon Jul 20 03:26:27 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it's partly because of the rise of 3D. I mean, if a director is sitting there on set with a 3D camera that cost orders of magnitude more than what he's used to, he might want to make the camera ""float"" a little bit just to get some parallax movement and justify the purchase. Then this style trickles down to smaller 2D films and eventually it permeates the industry."
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,Rb1138,2,Mon Jul 20 11:52:22 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, but using actual 3D cameras limits what they can do when it comes to movement as I understand it. Everyone is using Transformers as an example, if you look at part three compared to the first two Bay had to cut back on the breakneck editing and constant movement (relatively) due to the cameras at the time not being able to focus due to the native 3D. Now that could be something they're able to do with the technology now, I don't know. I'm no expert ha"
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,Flubby2,2,Mon Jul 20 03:32:32 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah definitely, editing and shakycam are affected by 3D. I'm talking about a more subtle type of movement though, where the camera is just kind of dollying to the right or left for no reason during a talking scene."
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,BearChomp,6,Mon Jul 20 15:01:18 2015 UTC,"I'm generally a fan of the moving camera, but I definitely see where you're coming from-- the recent movies you referenced are representative of a trend in the camera work of modern blockbusters that sort of simulated riding a roller coaster through the movie.  Combined with the prevalence of 3D, it seems that these kinds of movies are really trying to make themselves a different kind of ""immersive experience"" than we've seen in previous generations.  I suspect the swooping, flying camera trend will reach its limits before too long, much like the shaky-cam fad has (mercifully) been on the downturn lately.  More than likely,  future filmmakers will learn from today's filmmaking trends and use elements of the popular techniques in more effective ways, but in the meantime, I think cinematographers are simply experimenting with flashy camera work to keep things visually interesting."

TrueFilm,3dvjmm,William_da_foe,6,Mon Jul 20 09:23:50 2015 UTC,"In my personal opinion, I feel like you're right. At least for most blockbuster films. I kind of think it has to do something with the fact that the average movie goer's attention span is a lot shorter than it used to be, so having really steady shots might bore some people. I would love to see more steady shots in blockbusters these days, especially in action flicks, instead of just complete chaos in which the film is covering up for what they can't show, but of course it really does depend on the movie itself and if it really needs it. For some moments, I'm sure it would be awkward. While I'm not a fan of the editing in some of his films, Christopher Nolan has pretty good framing instead of just ""floating.""  Sometimes I feel like directors are just being lazy with their framing as well."
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,snowdog74,9,Mon Jul 20 13:58:29 2015 UTC,"It's the director's version of Three Card Monte.  Everyone from Nolan to Bay takes this approach of distracting us and dizzying us enough that we fail to notice narrative gaps.  Americans confuse gimmick with technique, whereas Ozu's static shots in Tokyo Story remove the obstacle of technology and connect the viewer with the story.  This is not as simple as it looks, and that's the problem... Danny Boyle with some tech is like a kid in a candy shop, or more aptly like Lars Ulrich getting a giant twenty piece drum set when he never learned to keep a steady beat on a snare drum.  It's lazy and it's sloppy.... proper execution of shots to give the editors something to work with requires meticulous planning.  Watch the sequence of shots as the clock tower is about to be struck and Marty McFly is running out of time in Back to the Future.  A series of static shots intercut very quickly that keep you quite well oriented on where and who and what is in relation to everything else... all the while, the clock ticking down until Marty slams his foot on the pedal.  This was all storyboarded out in exacting detail months before production began.  If the idea is for a shot to be dizzying, there's a structured way to convey that by showing you how the character is experiencing the disorientation without disconnecting you from your omnipotent point of view, without disorienting you from the story.   This is the purpose of starting and returning to master shots.  Consider again Marty running out of time.  Master shot of the clock tower.  The close up of Doc's facial expressions. Master shot of Main Street, Hill Valley.  The clock tower, Marty's hand on the alarm, Marty's hand on the time circuits, Marty's foot on the throttle, back to the car, the tires, the front of the car rushing toward us, Marty, the time circuits kicking in, sparks flying and so on... all disconnected and edited together quickly to convey the headlong force with which Marty is rushing, no pun intended, to literally beat the clock before his mind has a moment to catch up.... we feel Marty's disorientation without ever once losing our place."
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,stemid85,4,Sun Jul 19 22:45:11 2015 UTC,I feel like the wobbly camera is distracting people from bad acting more than anything else.   Actors are churned out by the dozen now and directors are making use of them by shaking their camera around for the sensitive scenes so people don't notice how bad they are.   Just a hunch.
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,in_some_knee_yak,2,Sun Jul 19 23:02:46 2015 UTC,"Jurassic World definitely suffers from the same problem. Except it's director is obviously out of his element and uses the camera movements as a crutch. Lots of other directors do this(hello, M. Bay), but at least their staging starts out decent.   Trevorrow shouldn't have been handed such a big franchise based on one good independent flick."
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,Rekcikssa23,2,Mon Jul 20 07:22:35 2015 UTC,yes and no. Fincher doesn't unless he wants a sense of omnipresent omnipotent but it's normally such a abstract large oner it's digital. I would say the modern lowest common denominator average film is bayeavision which has large hero shots and decent cuts but has so much going on screen you can't see what is happening.   another bad thing is cuts in action movies where you don't see the punch it's cut.
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,pepper_head,2,Mon Jul 20 06:21:45 2015 UTC,"In contrast to this, I saw 'Slow West' recently and the main thing I noticed was how little the camera moved. The majority of scenes are shot with very rigid wide/medium two shots and I thought that it gave it a very old fashioned theatrical feel to it. I'm sure this was very intentional and gave it a cool nostalgic vibe."
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,matt_the_muss,2,Mon Jul 20 10:10:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't notice in Ant-Man, but I will say, especially in the last few years, they are really abusing the hand held camera aesthetic.  I feel like lots of movies do this.  The camera doesn't need to be moving around constantly."
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,JackOfAllFilmTrades,2,Mon Jul 20 12:35:45 2015 UTC,"I like more camera movement rather than too little. Static shots have their place. I really don't care to see just a flat image on screen while people talk though, and as weird as ti may seem, I'm bored with reaction shot/reaction shot/reaction shot/. I think we can move beyond the static closeup cutaways for dialogue for example. As an editor myself, and a sometimes filmmaker and actor, and spending close to 250 hours the past couple months cutting a feature, you begin to think a lot about how to make things fresh, and looking at these scenes you spend so much time on and just thinking how it could have been done differently, more visually fun, and how to try and give the viewer a better sense of imagining themselves in 3d space in the moment inside the story instead of being hit with angle upon angle flashing before their eyes.   I'm a believer that the less cuts the better, though i realize this is more taxing on the production and actors, but the next short film I make will be done with as few cuts as possible relying more on well thought out camera motion in longer tracking shots to push the story along. I think there's something to be said skill wise as well to be able to come up with creative ways to minimalize the set to its bare essentials to allow for more freedom with the camera, and be able to plan blocking and camera movement well enough so it captures all necessary dialogue and moves us along in a way that's natural and doesn't feel forced."
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,Squidmaster7,2,Mon Jul 20 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"Strongly agree. The first time I saw Children of Men I feel in love with the camera moving through 3D space. Another surprising example of this is actually Louie, the FX show. The camera is always moving around, lots of times around a character to show their face or something they may be seeing."
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,rywon,2,Mon Jul 20 15:21:37 2015 UTC,"Alongside all the valid points made already, I think another factor may be because of how much easier it is these days to set up shots like that. Due to new technologies like digital (making the camera lighter, therefore easier to move), new equipment, hell, even drones - perhaps there is less resistance against shooting these shots because they are costing less money/time to do so."
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,LeifEriksonisawesome,4,Mon Jul 20 21:52:00 2015 UTC,"I think its a trend like any other, and that you in an alternate world with static shots remaining King and few movement shots, you'd clamor for movement.   I also think its not quite fair to compare the paragons of an era, to average modern films. I'd be more interested in a comparison amongst films who would otherwise be considered the same caliber. If one were to consider all the films of the past and not just the bastions of cinema, I'm sure you can find thoroughly dull and unmotivated use of static shots."
TrueFilm,3dvjmm,bhanguson,2,Mon Jul 20 15:22:05 2015 UTC,"It varies. Some movies have a lot of movement, and others not so much. In either extreme, it could be offputting.

TrueFilm,3dwx16,p-longstocking,4,Mon Jul 20 05:24:04 2015 UTC,"Perhaps PTA said it best. On the director's commentary he even admits that about 20 minutes into the film it becomes very basic and plot driven. It's a very good plot driven film with good characters, but plot driven is the last thing you'd think of when thinking of PTA looking at his other works. His films are about character and mood and style. His films rarely have the simple ""what will happen next?"" plot driven feel.  Sydney is a much more reserved and much simpler film thahn his others, but simple doesn't mean bad. It is still a very good film. PTA is my favorite director, so I'm a bit biased, but I would say having the majority of people considering Sydney your worst work is a very good problem to have. It's a solid film."
TrueFilm,3dwx16,JacObiWanKenobi02,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:21 2015 UTC,"but plot driven is the last thing you'd think of when thinking of PTA looking at his other works.   Boy, you said it. To the detriment of his films, IMO. I've always said that PTA's movies would be better if he hired a real writer. His stuff is all character, mood, and style with no where to go. If he could deliver character, mood, and style along with an actual story he'd finally win that Best Picture Oscar he so obviously and desperately covets."
TrueFilm,3dwx16,hipsterparalegal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:54:51 2015 UTC,"No it wouldn't. I like the fact that he hasn't got a plot driven story all the time.

TrueFilm,3dwx16,JFilm,4,Tue Jul 21 23:30:45 2015 UTC,"Still with most movie lovers it is just an afterthought among his other more known movies.   That's because it sort of is.  Hard Eight isn't a bad movie or anything, but it doesn't stack up to the rest of PTA's filmography.  It feels comparatively undistinguished compared to Boogie Nights or There Will Be Blood.  That's again not to say it's bad or anything, it's great, especially the acting, but it feels a lot more conventional compared to PTA's other films."
TrueFilm,3dwx16,A_Largo_Edwardo,2,Mon Jul 20 06:01:16 2015 UTC,It's a very intimate movie and doesn't have the grandness of his follow up work. But at least to me that's not something that is less appealing. Boogie Nights IMHO suffered from mediocre performances by Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds. All the performances in Hard Eight were spot on.
TrueFilm,3dwx16,E-Rok,4,Mon Jul 20 06:46:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's an afterthought at all, almost the opposite, but I have a few theories why some think of it that way. It's more subdued, less grandiose than his other films. The plot line is also less...dramatic than some of his other films. A lot of directors make a first film that is more intimate and that is not a bad thing. I feel Hard Eight is vital to PTA's oeuvre, it introduces Sydney, a character who we see in one form or another through most of PTA's work. I also feel the film was beautifully shot, a point that is often overlooked."
TrueFilm,3dwnfe,loosemoose29,8,Mon Jul 20 03:45:56 2015 UTC,"When I first saw Certified Copy, I felt rather neutral and, to be honest, was rather puzzled by everything I had seen.  In talking about it with my friend who watched the film with me, however, I began to realize just how brilliant of a film it was.  He and I saw the film from two completely separate directions.  To him, the second half of the film was just the two characters pretending to be a married couple; for me, the opposite was true.  The brilliance of Kiarostami is that he never tells us which is the truer version; for all we know, it's all a fabrication anyway.  Kiarostami, in all of his work, has been preoccupied with this dialectic between fiction and reality.  It's very visible in Close-Up, somewhat visible in Taste of Cherry towards the end, and is certainly present in my personal favorite of his films (though I've come to love them all nearly equally), Like Someone in Love.  I have also heard this is true of his Koker trilogy, though I haven't seen any of those films and cannot speak on their behalf.  I must say I'm a little confused when you write   it seems as though Kiarostami is profoundly interested in only how HE thinks and talks   I don't think there's an enormous discrepancy between the way characters act in the Before trilogy versus how they act in Certified Copy; both speak with deep philosophical musings.  I'm not entirely sure what you mean when you say that Kiarostami only cares about himself and how he thinks.  Linklater equally injects his philosophies into his works, and certainly in no subtler a way than Kiarostami (in fact, I would say Kiarostami is far more subtle).  You also mention how the ""box of mirrors fall upon each other as the movie continues,"" which I don't agree with.  This is one hell of a confusing movie, but it certainly never collapses on itself - it's because Kiarostami achieves the reversal without skipping a beat that makes the film as confusing as it is.  My recommendation is: try the film again.  And again.  And again.  The more times you watch this film, the more and more brilliant it becomes.  Kiarostami, along with many of his Iranian New-Wave contemporaries, all like to play with the borders of reality and fiction and this is certainly one of the great masterpieces of his career."
TrueFilm,3dwnfe,afewthoughtsonfilm,2,Mon Jul 20 04:10:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll certainly do that. What other Iranian New-Wave directors do you recommend? And where should I go next with Kiarostami?  And maybe I can clarify what I meant above.  As with Certified Copy's relation to Richard Linklater, I agree with you; Linklater often allows his own personal philosophies and interests to peek through. However, Linklater also has curiosity, and a humanistic interest in what others think, feel, and believe. He does not have judgement, and never places his ideas or the ideas of his characters on a pedestal. Take Waking Life, for example. Waking Life isn't some kind of crystalized idealogical manifesto, but a meandering dream-collage, built from a collection of equally engaging interactions. None of them show judgement, none of them give the answers, and all are weighed with equal humanity. And you get the feeling Linklater has heard and remembered people say these things.  This doesn't happen in Certified Copy. The movie seems to be a conversation with himself, built upon the idea of an effect that, once understood and unraveled, says nothing very insightful. Anyone can think about the nature of reality and fiction. Anyone can pose these questions. I think a greater movie would have framed the reality-fiction problem within the context of a more personal story with a solid narrative foundation. Instead, the metaphor of reality and fiction blurring and dissolving becomes literal; it seems too easy to me. I think a better movie that asked the same questions (and larger, more universal questions in addition) was Synechdoche, New York.   In fact, the theme of a reality within a reality is one explored by Kaufman in that movie. That's what I meant by my ""box of mirrors"" image. There are two narrative poles in the scheme of Certified Copy (the unmarried story, and the married story), but then there are chunks of dialogue that also seem isolated in their own narrative universe, and then lines within the dialogue that, again, seem disembodied from any overarching plot. The movie is like sand caught in a net; what begins as a solid film soon slips through into smaller parts until nothing is certain. But I think that's the point.  For me, effect overwhelms substance in Certified Copy. This probably wasn't the best movie to start exploring Kiarosami, and I'm still open to enjoying his work. I want to try his other movies and then frame Certified Copy in the context of his oeuvre.   Maybe you can help me understand this movie in a new way? Or maybe it's easiest beginning somewhere else in Kiarostami's work?"
TrueFilm,3dwnfe,Murmillion,2,Mon Jul 20 16:40:05 2015 UTC,"The fiction-reality division is wonderfully played in Close-Up, Kiarostami's greatest in my opinion. Definitely check this one out to see how Kiarostami approaches filmmaking.   Mohsen Makhmalbaf and Jafar Panahi have both worked with Kiarostami and have consequently subsumed his influence. Makhmalbaf's A Moment of Innocence is clearly inspired by Close-Up but like Certified Copy, it is a reflection of the director rather than of some event. Panahi plays with this divide to address issues within Iran, namely the struggle of the woman: The Mirror, The Circle and to a lesser extent, The White Ribbon all play on this idea. He also worked on Mohammed Rasoulof's The White Meadows which is a serious criticism of the political regime, which got them jail time, and led to Panahi's masterpiece, This is Not a Film, which, alongside Close-Up, is the best example of how the Iranian directors fuck with the audience."
TrueFilm,3dwnfe,CinematicPersona,2,Mon Jul 20 17:14:52 2015 UTC,"I've only seen it and Like Someone in Love, so I can't really speak as to his entire filmography, which I admit I have not been inspired to explore.  To me it just seemed simple. Like, there were specific stylistic affectations employed in the (endless cough cough) dialogue scenes, but they never added to the characters or their story. The film pretty much literally describes its thesis in the opening, and then enacts it with no invention over the next two hours and ten minutes. (I'm not checking imdb for its actual length, it just feels long).  Maybe there's supposed to be some supreme beauty in that; the shots are well composed and lit, if not interestingly, and the dialogue is exceptionally well recorded. Juliette Binoche is my second favourite actor, but I don't even think her work here is of particular note. I really have very little else I can say about it, qualitatively. I've heard mention of the deft tongue with which it uses the various languages spoken. I can't comment, as I didn't catch anything profound in such. Maybe a polyglot would appreciate this more, and I'm just ill-equipped. Which is fair, but then strikes me as a few steps too esoteric."
TrueFilm,3dwnfe,ronfrakkingswanson1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:39:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not a massive fan. I simply cannot reconcile the narrative shift with Kiarostami's style.  The two halves, by themselves, are great, but I don't think Kiarostami merges them in a way which feels cohesive. There are certain echoes throughout, but his style is so rigidly realistic that it feels at odds with the free-flowing narrative. Both times I've watched this I always find myself amazed at swiftness of the segue, but then become frustrated that Kiarostami wants us to emotionally invest in a secondary narrative which he has undermined in the first half of his film. It doesn't help that the males performance becomes shaky in the later half, and I honestly don't find the whole 'what is real and what isn't' kind of game that Kiarostami attempts to play all that interesting when it keeps me at a distance from the drama. When something like The Double Life of Veronique pulls this trick it feels natural, because Kieslowski imbues his world with a sense of the other-worldy; the two halves intermingle and inform each other."
TrueFilm,3dwbub,DLIU36,9,Mon Jul 20 01:59:53 2015 UTC,"I feel like if he did give more exposition then people would have complained about the exposition and then people would debate the science behind it even more...   Agreed. I've been watching Wayward Pines recently on TV and (no spoilers) so many of the response are about ""well how could this be done and that be done"". They are asking for the full theory behind everything; but the characters themselves wouldn't be discussing that: they are there in that world and so that world does exist and therefore the tech did exist.  So long as the world is coherent then that's okay I think - particularly when the story itself is about certain relationships and characters, rather than a discussion about certain ideas (see Interstellar and Inception for how taking that approach doesn't help anyway).  Basically, I'm saying:    Viewer nitpicking and lack of imagination =/= plot hole.   Given our own ignorance of much of our actual lives, if we applied the same approach to daily living we'd come apart very quickly...  Most of us don't have much of a clue when if comes to how our worlds work (technology, politic, economics) - but instead of seeing plot holes, we accept the story unfolding before us. Why? Because the stuff we see is there and we know we do exist - therefore it is allowed. Therefore we don't spend our days explaining the background of everything to each other. Characters in their worlds are in the same situation.  Character behaviour being inconsistent with their situation is a different matter altogether though.  TL;DR: Films like Looper are right not to turn into lectures about time travel. What matters is character action and motivation, and that these are coherent. Films which attempt to explain the world-behind-the-film end up sacrificing character coherence and become Interstellar."
TrueFilm,3dwbub,TriumphantGeorge,2,Mon Jul 20 13:09:18 2015 UTC,"My problem isn't exposition though. I'm not asking the movie to stop and give me a lecture and in fact don't want it.   Look at Back to the Future: there's no lectures, no exposition dumps, we just see bits a pieces of time travel visually, with Doc giving a line or two to help us understand. My problem with Looper isn't that the time travel theory is badly explained, it's that it doesn't make sense and the film does a shitty job making it seem like it makes sense. BTTF uses almost the same theory of time travel (single timeline where changes can make people disappear), but does it sooo much better. Zemeckis knows when to show you something, when not to, and more importantly how to show. BTTF makes sense on first viewing, then requires a bit more thought if you decide to get into the physics of it, but still ultimately holds together because enough is left out. Looper has those scenes right off the bay that cause me to think ""that makes no fucking sense"", even when I was excited to see the film the first time and more than willing to suspend my disbelief.   So...did the dude not have fingers his hope life or what? Do the people who keep saying character motivation is the only thing that matters at the expense of all logic seriously not find themselves asking that question?"
TrueFilm,3dwbub,CommissionerValchek,2,Tue Jul 21 00:15:01 2015 UTC,"I definitely understand where you're coming from, but it's not really a problem for this film, as far as my viewing went anyway.   Looper isn't really ""about"" time travel and it's probably the most honest film in being upfront with that. (Rather than, say, Predestination which is a good enough film but shows that trying to play it straight in order to focus on the 'thing' is often at the expense of the credibility of the character story.) It actually tells you how to view the film, during the film. So if you don't like it, it's your fault! ;-)  I think Looper's time model is effectively ""self-consistent POV"" rather than flow-in-time, and it stays pretty consistent with that - but it doesn't really matter. The only time-travel model that can truly remain internally consistent is one where we have a static universe of all possible subjective experiential moments, which is traversed by individual conscious perspectives - an Infinite Grid of All Possible Moments. But that's not really portrayable onscreen and would have zero tension.  TL;DR: Looper is pretty upfront about its approach: it's going to cheat a bit. It shows the impact of change from the onscreen character POV perspective, and messes with 'ripple' delay for dramatic effect."
TrueFilm,3dwbub,TriumphantGeorge,2,Tue Jul 21 07:21:12 2015 UTC,"I get that, but honestly it pisses me off when a film tells me ""don't think about it"". I want to think about it, that's why I'm watching a film with that plot element in it.  And I agree that that's the most plausible time travel theory by far, but you don't even have to go outside Bruce Willis's filmography to find a film that portrays it brilliantly: 12 Monkeys. Timecrimes does as well. Multiple timelines I think are (slightly less) plausible too, and those can be portrayed pretty dramatically. But anyway I have no problem with films that use the more cinematic ripple effect, but as I said, Back to the Future proves you can do it without having to tell the audience to turn their brain off for the time travel to make at least intuititve sense."
TrueFilm,3dwbub,CommissionerValchek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:30 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the film was just having fun with the viewer, right?  But it maybe does mean the film wasn't intending to explore in detail an area which probably a lot of the marketed-to audience exactly did want to get into.  I don't think that's the director's fault necessarily. I'm not sure how you get around using a sci-fi premise casually when, unlike The Terminator or whatever, you're not really using the genre beyond it. In many ways the film is more horror-based, 1970s style, than sci-fi.  In the film, the characters themselves seem pretty confused by the whole time thing. Was this film basically miscategorised? I think Looper will be ""rediscovered"" at some point when genres become a bit more blended.  Yep, the La Jetée/Twelve Monkeys and Primer/Timecrimes loop structures appear the most solid, but they do it by directing you to pay attention to some aspects and not others. And they are more ""about"" time travel. Back to the Future does the same misdirection but differently. It almost doesn't really deal with time travel as such, it just lays out a simple scenario: if your parents don't get it on, then no you.  Looper is more the latter then the former. Did it err by stating the fakery upfront, and refusing to provide viewers with a basic plot point to follow in lieu of a more complex theory?"
TrueFilm,3dwbub,TriumphantGeorge,4,Tue Jul 21 17:12:06 2015 UTC,That second half change is something I both like and dislike about Looper. The movie sets up a perfectly good Bruce Willis vs Joseph Gordon-Levitt action movie and then doesn't do it. Instead Johnson keeps throwing more SciFi ideas into the scenario all the way to the end. That was fun and the second half of the movie still made sense. But an hour into a movie is still pretty late to completely change what it's about and who the characters are so I can see what that would throw people. It's ambitious but the reason most movies don't do this is that it distracts from the main characters just when they've become compelling.
TrueFilm,3dwbub,lordhadri,5,Mon Jul 20 05:04:54 2015 UTC,"I will validate your opinion. Looper is probably in my top 5 all-time enjoyable first-watches. The more I thought about it, the less I liked it, but I still can appreciate it. I've seen it probably 5 times and I'm due for a rewatch. Emily Blunt is great, Paul Dano is crucial, and I just liked the rhythm and how it climaxed. It has maybe one too many things going on that it shouldn't have, but I love Looper because of all the reasons you stated, I like the characters and their relationships."
TrueFilm,3dwbub,sober_as_an_ostrich,8,Mon Jul 20 05:27:39 2015 UTC,"When people say our expectations are the reason we didn't like the movie I just reply, ""Because I wouldn't have watched the movie I actually got if I'd known.""  You can't remove the sci-fi from the storytelling. The whole reason the movie exists is the sci-fi conceit. It informs every single decision and action made from beginning to end.  And, unfortunately, some of the sci-fi doesn't make sense. Why are gunslingers and blunderbusses so important if we repeatedly see that everyone else has much better weapons? That's just a failure on the director's part to contrast their efficacy in any meaningful way.  This plays havoc with the climax of the film when Old Joe basically runs through the mob using THEIR OWN weapons against them and all of the weapons are basically just modern weapons. It doubles-down on how useless future weapons are compared to what we have today even though so much of the beginning is spent on world building.  And then we get to the stakes. We get that the main character is really worried about the Rainmaker, but the Rainmaker doesn't really seem to be causing any problems in the future. He's involved in a reign of terror slaughtering mobsters left and right but we're never shown or told that he is turning his efforts on civilians or consolidating power. The mob is shitting themselves but the BIG BAD is basically the Punisher.  The limited perspective of the mob as our entry into this world also kind of ruins our perspective. We learn that Old Joe is evil because he does things we can actually identify as evil and is motivated by purely selfish means. But nothing they're fighting over has any influence on some kind of relatable morality outside of Old Joe. Again, they're all bad people doing bad things and the stakes are that one of the bad people IN THE LAST THIRD OF THE MOVIE suddenly starts killing little kids.  It's a nice-looking movie, I'll give it that. It has pretty good performances. The idea of the Rainmaker is a good one. The central conflict between the Joes is a deeply personal one. But it's really difficult to stay interested when the rules are nebulous, the world is undefined, and we don't know what anything does.  If he wanted to tell a drama, he should have just stuck to the drama and left out the sci-fi. As it is, the sci-fi just muddles the whole affair."
TrueFilm,3dwbub,BZenMojo,6,Mon Jul 20 03:43:49 2015 UTC,"but the Rainmaker doesn't really seem to be causing any problems in the future.   Was that the impression you got? I mean the movie leaves it vague on purpose but we do see for ourselves what this person is capable of. And we do briefly see a battle scene in the future, so it seems like the situation was getting pretty severe."
TrueFilm,3dwbub,lordhadri,6,Mon Jul 20 04:59:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I get your point about the guns. Blunderbusses are mainly to be used when doing a hit because they're powerful with a wide spread so all the Looper needs to do is aim vaguely and pull the trigger to get the job done. Then Kid Blue uses the fancy revolver because that's the kind of guy he is. He wants a gun he can spin on his finger and look cool doing it.   The Rainmaker isn't just the Punisher. We see glimpses of the future that seem to be in a state of full on revolt. He's not just taking out gang leaders he's leading a war against them and is using his newfound power for some messed up things like tearing Bruce Willis from his family.   It's not just about what the Rainmaker is doing though. For Young Joe especially it's that this decent kid has been so warped by whatever life he has lead. Clearly his power became too much for him and he got carried away.    If he wanted to tell a drama, he should have just stuck to the drama and left out the sci-fi. As it is, the sci-fi just muddles the whole affair.   If he'd done that the film wouldn't have been about anything. The sci-fi conceit is central to the themes of the cycles of violence and how the way we view and confront ourself defines us and those around us. That's what makes it such excellent sci-fi for me that the whole conceit of the film ties directly into what it's exploring rather than making a pretty backdrop."
TrueFilm,3dwfxo,WeedAndHookerSmell,8,Mon Jul 20 02:36:16 2015 UTC,"A few days ago i watched The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I generally don't like horror movies and i realized this is because most modern ones are just generally bad. TCM is the beginning of the teenager road trip slasher genre. It has a lot of the tropes that carry on through modern horror films made in the same vein. The thing is that i loved TCM even though i recognized a lot of what happened because of new horror films. That didn't change a thing for me. The film was effective because of it's use of atmosphere and excellent camera work. Modern horror films have atmosphere but it feels heavy-handed to me, that' just my opinion but i feel like directors these days think immediate gore and a creepy score with loud crashes when things jump out at you are enough. It's not. I also feel like TCM has ""banality of evil"" thing going for it that adds to it's disturbing feel. The characters die so quickly and we don't really know much about them. Oh yeah, it also didn't have any jump scares. I wonder where those came from."
TrueFilm,3dwfxo,swantonist,3,Mon Jul 20 12:12:48 2015 UTC,"TCM is probably my favourite horror film. There's definitely more high-brow horror films out there but there's always been something about TCM where, for me, it just gets everything right. The music, the sound effects, the mise en scène, the characters, all of it is perfectly balanced and the film is truly disturbing. If you're genuinely interested in it, I recommend reading 'Men, Women & Chainsaws' by Carol Clover, she talks about the relationship TCM (among others) has with gender, male-castration, city vs country."
TrueFilm,3dwfxo,pepper_head,6,Mon Jul 20 12:51:29 2015 UTC,"I would say, in short, no.  It's a frequent thing in the contemporary age, mostly because of popularity of post-modernism within everything (there's even post-modern Geico ads, which is absurd to me).  But, for example, I don't fine It Follows to be subversive at all, yet it is a fine modern horror film.  The same can be said of The Babadook from last year.  Since the medium has existed for so long, there are obviously going to be a lot of these subversive works as a reaction to the tropes that have been built up over the years, but I wouldn't argue they are the exclusive path to good horror these days."
TrueFilm,3dwfxo,afewthoughtsonfilm,3,Mon Jul 20 02:48:46 2015 UTC,"Well ""effective"" is a pretty subjective term. Insidious & The Conjuring are pretty run of the mill, but imo are some of the best horror movies we have that have been recently released."
TrueFilm,3dwfxo,TrumanB-12,3,Mon Jul 20 09:31:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand the question. Is this an abstract statement about how horror could be more effective, or an implication that modern horror films rely too heavily on subversion of tropes?  While I think there have been a few films to come out recently that have played on trope subversion, this is not a predominant trend, and has mostly occurred within comedies (Cabin in the Woods, What We Do in the Shadows, Final Girl). That's just the nature of comedy. Setting up expectations and then knowingly deviating is part of the basic comedic toolkit.  If you look more broadly at recent horror films I don't think you see a lot of trope subversion. ""Effective"" is a highly subjective word, but some of films that have received positive word of mouth over the past few years include A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, Oculus, Starry Eyes, The Conjuring, Berberian Sound Studio, The Pact, The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh, and The Woman in Black, not to mention sci-fi horror (Under the Skin, Prometheus) or psychological horror (The Babadook, Magic Magic, Creep). Not a lot of subversion going on there. Even a film like It Follows, while playing on horror tropes of '80s, it's not really subverting them. It's just putting a new twist on old ideas.   A final note that I have to include with any mention of ""modern horror""... There is a general tendency to hold a broad section of contemporary horror films across all tones, styles, studios, and formats up in comparison to only the established classics of the past 50 years. If you do this with any form of media, you will come to the conclusion that the contemporary is inferior to the classics. The classics are classics for a reason. There was no shortage of formulaic, trend-exploiting, jump-scaring, blood-gushing gore released right along side those classics in every year of horror film history. Keep comparisons within the proper context."
TrueFilm,3dwfxo,LuigiVanPeebles,2,Mon Jul 20 15:47:19 2015 UTC,"It depends on the viewer. When a horror movie acknowledges and reckons with horror tropes, what it does is give viewers the confidence that the film is controlled and self-aware, rather than a mindless rehash of empty cliches. Some people demand this kind of confidence before they will submit themselves to a movie. Others don't need this as much."
TrueFilm,3dwfxo,loosemoose29,2,Mon Jul 20 11:42:54 2015 UTC,"It's worth defining what is meant by effective. Do we mean a film which frightens us? A film we find intellectually satisfying? A film which we find frankly enjoyable? The criteria for what makes an effective horror is going to be somewhat subjective, and if and how those criteria are met depends not least upon how many horror films a spectator has already seen.  Horror is somewhat unusual (and in my opinion particularly interesting) because it consists of genre films which almost by definition are going to be somewhat formulaic and aimed at an audience with specific expectations and which furthermore trade on archetypal fears (bodily harm, sexual corruption, the unknown, loss of identity); but which also rely fairly heavily for effectiveness on doing something unexpected-it's hard to be frightened by something you fully know is coming. Many modern horror films try to take a shortcut to this by an over-reliance on gore and on cheap tricks like jump scares.  I don't think that gore automatically means that a horror film is lazy or ineffective (I'd recommend the 2009 film The Loved Ones for anyone who's both interested in that question and decidedly unsqueamish) though. Horror has been described as a genre with a distinctly visual bias, which I’d rephrase as a non-linguistic bias, and depending on the way in which the gore is used in the broader context of the film it can very much play to that bias. However where I think a lot of modern horrors fall down, and where something like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre excels, is in not maintaining that bias throughout the film. TCM toyed with the resonance that a family of physical labourers left behind by the march of progress, and the deep gulf between the youth of the counterculture and the culture of the American rural heartland, had for its contemporary audience, but did so largely non linguistically. None of the Family stopped to explain “We are not so different you and I. I am literally eviscerating and dehumanising you, just as domestic labour policy has metaphorically done to me”, which is what would have happened in something like Saw V.  This has been a longwinded way of saying that basically it doesn’t matter so much whether a horror is subverting or adhering to tropes so much as it matters how skilfully that is done, and that that skill entails a deep familiarity with the tropes and their previous iterations and a resulting confidence to use them is a “show, don’t tell” way. It ain’t what you do, it’s the way that you do it. The House of The Devil, It Follows, The Babadook, and You’re Next are all recent horrors off the top of my head which succeeded because they so were so deeply steeped in the history of horror tropes and deployed them so skilfully, tinkering with them only as far as was necessary to make them more interesting for a cinema-literate audience"
TrueFilm,3dwkcw,nj123,11,Mon Jul 20 03:16:22 2015 UTC,"I am a huge Haneke fan and, as a result, am also a huge fan of Funny Games (you'll find me in the camp that prefers the 2007 version, as I think it makes better use of some of Haneke's signature techniques).  You're right that much of the breaking-the-fourth wall is on the nose, but it is done so with complete intent.  To give a bit of context, Haneke despises violence in cinema.  To him, any display of violence is pornographic and sends the wrong message to audiences.  He gets into a bit of his philosophy in this article as well as in this video.  Across all of his films, violence is fairly uncommon and when it occurs, it is dealt with such seriousness so as to prevent any sort of glorification of violence à la Tarantino, for example.  In Funny Games, Haneke takes a Brechtian approach in order to subvert the American slasher films.  To Haneke, such films are despicable as the glorify the torture and murder of people, which is indecent in any situation.  To make the disturbing nature of this well known, Haneke really pulls out all the stops; Cat in the Bag, when I first saw it, was one of the worst things I had seen, up there with the conclusion of Antichrist.  However, the problem is that as a result of the medium, it is wholly possible to become so absorbed in the drama unfolding on screen, regardless of how sickening it may be.  Not wanting to allow for his audience to ever become fully absorbed, consistently reminding them how disgusting this is, he has his characters continue to break the fourth wall so as to pull his audience out of the experience.  It can be frustrating to some, but I find it to be a really smart way for Haneke to convey the themes he wants to in his piece.  It isn't subtle, yet in this case, Haneke argues it shouldn't be subtle; his point is that an audience should never become engrossed in something so outright horrible.  As for benefits/detriments for breaking the fourth wall, I think it depends on the circumstance.  For example, I find the breaking of the fourth wall at the end of Goodfellas to be rather frustrating and hypocritical on Scorsese's part.  However, my favorite filmmaker is Lars von Trier and I'm personally very fascinated with Brechtian theater, so I'm less phased by the breaking of the fourth wall personally."
TrueFilm,3dwkcw,afewthoughtsonfilm,7,Mon Jul 20 03:57:29 2015 UTC,"I like your thoughts and I want to add that I actually believe Haneke frequently breaks the fourth wall in almost every film. Not as direct as in FG (2007) of course, but in more nuanced and subtle ways. Caché, does this superbly. At first, the viewer is presented with some form of drama and mystery in the form of someone filming a couple outside their home, but you can't see who the camera man is. Later in the movie the viewer may (or may not) realize that it was never the actual mystery of the movie. Haneke forces the viewer to be aware of the cinema, beware of this fourth wall. Maybe he isn't breaking it, but in nearly every single movie of his he is asking questions like ""what is a film?"" and ""is this the movie?"". This makes me appreciate Haneke as a director and as sort of a film critic. He always seeks to point out the conventions of cinema, and I can almost feel his infuriation with it as his movies goes along.  Edit: SPOILERS for Seventh Continenth below!  I suddenly remembered the ending of this movie, how the entire family is stuck watching TV in a dark bedroom, after their lives and things are completely destroyed. Mindlessly absorbing the white noise, much like viewers absorb mindless cinema. Maybe this is a stretch, but I think the movie is very selfaware and points that out to the viewer."
TrueFilm,3dwkcw,chryzsh,3,Mon Jul 20 06:44:35 2015 UTC,"I'm curious: why do you find the Goodfellas fourth wall break hypocritical? I thought it's pretty consistent. The whole movie Henry is speaking to us through narration, so I find the courtroom scene to be a logical conclusion of that."
TrueFilm,3dwkcw,MightBeAJerk,5,Mon Jul 20 15:06:29 2015 UTC,"The Newsweek interview that  /u/afewthoughtsonfilm linked is really fascinating, and I think this excerpt does well to explain Haneke's intentions regarding less-than-subtle fourth wall breaks:    The Czech writer Milan Kundera wrote about kitsch as a kind of false emotion that the Soviets used for propaganda, to manipulate people for political ends. You mention film's history as a propaganda tool. Is that something that's on your mind as you make a film, keeping the film from acting as propaganda?  Yes, of course. But automatically when you make a film you're manipulating the spectator. If you place your camera here instead of there, you're going to give a very different impression, so filmmaking always involves manipulation. The question is rather, to what end do you manipulate the spectator? I've often said that manipulation is a form of rape. The only acceptable form of rape is when you rape the spectator into autonomy, make the spectator aware of their role as a receptor, as a victim, so that they become autonomous or independent.   Despite the questionable wording, I think this is Haneke's philosophy in a nutshell (for some of his works, at least). In films like Funny Games and Cache, I've always interpreted his intention as trying to directly engage with the audience. Take Funny Games: Haneke lays out a pretty basic plot with a narrative that can come across as ""edgy for the sake of being edgy"" 98% of the time. But in that other 2%, Haneke doesn't just break the flow of the plot, but he deliberately shatters the narrative. By rhetorically asking the audience if they want to see the family play the game, or by literally rewinding the story to do it better the second time Haneke uses his characters as a medium to directly address his audience, and ask them: ""Is this really what you want? Why?""  I think one of the most important things to consider with Funny Games is that Haneke doesn't seem interested in telling a story whatsoever (as is evident with the completely anti-climactic final death). Instead what he wants is to subvert his very particular audience's (i.e. American consumers of violence in mainstream media) expectations and break them from their propagandist norms. In a sense, Funny Games is not about what happens on screen, but rather it's about how you yourself react to what happens on screen."

I do like what Jodorowsky does in Holy Mountain, though, as when I read ""fourth wall"" that was the first film popped into my head. And Haneke does it better than anyone, I think.  Haneke is far and away one of my favorite filmmakers, and arguably one of the best directors working during our  lifetime. As /u/chryzsh points out, he utilizes an interesting fourth wall technique superbly in Cache, to me a film that is in some ways a sort of cross between Benny's Video and Funny Games."

Also there are dozens of found footage films which incorporate the camera itself into the storyspace, rather than just taking the perspective of a character.  I'm not sure I agree about cuts interfering with the immersion into a scene. Well, I don't at all, though I can see what you mean.  Also there's loads of GoPro stuff on youtube that, by its nature, adopts this point of view. Like this"

It's not that they necessarily interfere with immersion, but they can act as a sort of tension breaker. For example the chase scene in Children of Men when they're escaping the farm and Clive Owen is pushing the stalled car while the pursuers get closer and closer – I feel way more on the edge of my seat watching that scene than most chases that feature lots of cuts to highlight the action. The camera staying with Owen makes it feel like you're there beside him trying to escape rather than being a disjointed viewer, so it really ups the anxiety.    I forgot about Enter the Void, but that's a really good example. Haven't seen the others you mentioned but I'll definitely look into them."

One thing games have got going for them is understanding how to make each frame intelligible, and this goes a long way in the portrayal of action sequences. Sorry about all this game stuff but people and developers do use first person in a very interesting way that I think has a lot of potential. Some examples:  The opening sequence of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, one of the best uses of the first person view in the industry.  The first five minutes of Bioshock.   This painstakingly choreographed run of a level from Dishonored. While I wouldn't call this art in a filmic sense, it does possess qualities that many action films fail to achieve."

Since FP is fairly common and accepted in videogames and Go Pro videos, I think that this actually could have happened.  So why didn't it? I would guess it is related to theater arts. Early filmmakers took many cues from the stage, and theater doesn't really do FP perspective."
TrueFilm,3dux0v,RatherPedestrian,17,Mon Jul 20 01:52:51 2015 UTC,"Horror films excel at it. The voyeuristic perspective is a simple and effective tool to convey dred and stir up some tension and suspense. Even if it isn't a real POV (the force in Evil Dead), the audience still gets all of the fear it instills. The fear of being watched is so basic and instinctual, and it's conveyed visually with this technique rather effortlessly. Most notably in the opening long take of Halloween where Michael Myer's origin is documented through his eyes. The earliest examples I've seen are Psycho and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre both of which are hugely influential in their own right.   The recent film Maniac, technically related to but heavily different from its 80s counterpart, was shot entirely in this fashion and I enjoyed it for the most part. A fresh idea in the age of studio horror for 13 year olds to make out to.  I probably see it most employed by parkour enthusiasts, snowboarders, surfers, bicyclists etc. That fact has been incorporated into a few action movies simply because of how viscerile it is. In the age of video games, it's actually a pretty common and useful convention. Google Glass, had it caught on, would've been another source of first person footage for the masses. Think about how impossible it was when movie cameras were unwieldy, heavy and so loud you had to put them in soundproof booths to get clear audio from the actors.  In the future, when virtual reality is more advanced/affordable I could see filmmakers and big studios giving it a try. The benefit of 3D without the limitations."

TrueFilm,3dux0v,TheWarpedOne,3,Sun Jul 19 21:07:24 2015 UTC,"Should add ""Strange Days"" to that list. Lots of POV in that SciFi film."
TrueFilm,3dux0v,StinkyBrittches,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"Rereading your post and thinking about extended or action specific POV scenes, I would again recommend Strange Days, and also the Omaha Beach scene from Saving Private Ryan.  It's not uncut, but it features some great POV action."
TrueFilm,3dux0v,TheWarpedOne,8,Sun Jul 19 22:16:37 2015 UTC,"I think it tends to be cheesy as hell. However it can be used effectively and with great effect if carefully planned and executed (like most techniques) and most importantly if it serves the story.  Although technically ""not a film"", you should check out Peep Show it's a comedy that is entirely told with a FP view of everything. When you first start watching it you tend to notice, but as the story unfolds the effect washes away and you totally forget that literally every camera angle you saw was from one character or the other's POV.  There is an occasional establishing shot of a building or what not, but even these are from a human POV, there is no fly-overs, crane shots, dollies, or even sliders. Switching from watching this show to anything else, it really makes you appreciate how artificial most camera angles are."
TrueFilm,3dux0v,starbick,7,Sun Jul 19 21:56:43 2015 UTC,"Surprised no one has mentioned Gravity yet. This scene has a first person, unbroken action shot that goes on almost a full minute. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgYZtNhAgaE&t=3m20s There are a few other shots in the movie that use first person, but this one is the most adrenaline pumping and frantic. I think Cuaron used these shots particularly well, since they help establish isolation and loneliness. By seeing through Dr Stone's eyes, we can see just how vast and empty space is around her."
TrueFilm,3dux0v,catalyst_incognito,5,Sun Jul 19 22:44:29 2015 UTC,"FW Murnau's The Last Laugh (1924) features a sequence of a drunk character trying to walk on a sidewalk. The tracking shots cut back and forth with POV shots from the character's perspective. It's worth noting because for the first time (that I know of) the camera became subjective. The POV shots are shaky and have a blurry, tunnel-vision effect applied. The audience is pulled into literally seeing the world from the character's eyes. It's an important event in the development of film's own cinematic language.  Not nearly as important, but entertaining in a gimmicky sort of way is Lady in the Lake (1947), in which almost the entire movie is shot from a first-person POV. The movie's posters declare ""YOU and Robert Montgomery solve a murder mystery together!"""
TrueFilm,3dux0v,BorisJonson1593,4,Sun Jul 19 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting subject because film often drifts in and out of first person without overtly signaling that it has. Technically, almost any eyeline match is intended to be from first person so Alfred Hitchcock was a master of first person cinematography/editing. If you're looking for more overt examples, Being John Malkovich has a number of extended first person scenes. Because of the nature of the film they're almost kind of double first person scenes which is really interesting.  As far as why first person isn't terribly common in film, I think it's because part of the point of the camera is that it can pick up on things the actors can't. It's incredibly common to build tension by intercutting or cross cutting or showing things in relation to the actors that the actors aren't aware of. Shooting from first person kind of prevents you from doing that. Our vision is fairly limited while a camera is potentially unlimited. Shooting from first person means that you're limiting yourself on purpose so most directors only do it when it'll add meaning to a scene or sequence.  As far as why other mediums do it, the reasons are pretty disparate. It's done in literature to give you a more intimate look at a character's psyche and motivation and in modernist literature it's often done in order to make you doubt the person whose perspective you're getting. Modernist literature subverts this at times, but there is an expectation than an omniscient narrator is objective an honest. That expectation has been broken down and subverted enough with first person narrators that you almost expect a book narrated in first person to give an unreliable account. Weirdly enough, I think it's done for similar reasons in video games and pornography. In both instances first person exists to give you the sense that you're experiencing what's happening on screen. That's obviously heightened in video games since the player has actual control and agency, but the basic reason is similar.   Because video games are unique in their ability to give you control over what's happening, first person makes a lot of sense. I think you'll also notice that games in third person (The Witcher series, Mass Effect or almost any other BioWare RPG) tend to have prominent, often pre-written lead characters that drive the story forward. On the other hand games that are primarily first person (COD, most of Bethesda's RPGs) tend to deemphasize the player character and characters in general and instead emphasize exploration and total player freedom as well as gameplay and mechanics. That's far from a perfect comparison, obviously. The Mario games are third person but they're popular because of the mechanics, not because Mario is a well-written lead character."
TrueFilm,3dux0v,hadrijana,3,Sun Jul 19 19:26:20 2015 UTC,"StinkyBrittches already mentioned this, but Strange Days is what immediately came to mind when I read the title of the thread. The opening sequence with the restaurant heist, in particular. I can't remember seeing such a long, action-filled, first person POV take in any other movie. I guess the inspiration must have come, in no small part, from pioneering first person shooters like Doom, which were insanely popular at the time.   First person is used abundantly in other media: written word, video games, action sports, even pornography. Why do you think it's relatively rare in films?   I imagine it must be because emotional immersion trumps sensory immersion when it comes to investing oneself in the story. What we connect to, as human beings, is not action, but reaction. And it's very hard to gauge emotional reactions without any facial expressions or body language to read."
TrueFilm,3dux0v,StinkyBrittches,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:37:49 2015 UTC,"You know, it never even occured to me how the growing popularity of FPS's influenced Strange Days.  Probably because I was a high schooler at the time, and they were so ubiquitous then.  But looking back, yeah, the timing is like perfect for that.  Great point."
TrueFilm,3dux0v,DrMephistopheles,3,Tue Jul 21 21:36:02 2015 UTC,I would have to say Dark Passage with Bogart and Bacall.  It was really effective how all of the shots prior to Bogart getting surgery to hide his face were either shot in first person or while his face hidden.  It was quite an effective use of first person and certainly one of my favorite noir films (especially being from SF).
TrueFilm,3dux0v,SlightlyOffensive,3,Mon Jul 20 12:35:26 2015 UTC,"I always thought Jonathan Demme was great at using first person perspective.

TrueFilm,3dux0v,wmille15,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:08:32 2015 UTC,"Every time the camera switches perspectives is a chance to subconsciously remind yourself you're watching a movie   You're right. The funny thing here though is that when we switch into the first person perspective it's an even bigger jolt to the audience than a regular cut. Like a jump cut, a cut to first person will always draws attention to itself. The audience will focus on the filming technique instead of the story being narrated. I think filmmakers are more likely to go for a 'found footage' cut because even though it draws attention to its own technique, it can be made to fit within the narrative sense of the world. First person cuts work in horror films, as /u/RatherPedestrian points out, because I believe a monster (human or not) warrants the kind of power to seize the narrative power of the camera.   So I think the only way to go for that so-called 'full immersion' of first person but get around the jolt of a first person cut is to have no cuts, and just one long first person take, like in Enter the Void, or Russian Ark. But that's really tough to do for 90 minutes. And again, the funny thing is that the viewer kind of knows it's a tough thing to do, and they spend a lot of time wondering, ""How the hell did they do this?"" Which breaks that full immersion thing.  On the other hand, you could upload your 90 minutes of GoPro footage and call it a day. We'd all be immersed. It just might not be a great film."
TrueFilm,3dux0v,TheWarpedOne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:55:57 2015 UTC,"No offense but I can't think of anything worse than watching ninety minutes of GoPro footage.  See my comment about Peep Show. It uses only POV camera work, has cuts, and immerses you in a story without drawing attention to the use of POV or subjecting the audience to one long-ass take."
TrueFilm,3dux0v,wmille15,2,Sun Jul 19 22:02:43 2015 UTC,"Ah, guess you're right. A movie could be entirely first person and still have cuts. Though that wouldn't make much sense narratively, would it? Who's doing the editing? It'd start to get a found footage feel, I would think.  Interesting that they're using many persons' perspectives in Peep Show. Reminds of this scene from The Rules of Attraction."

TrueFilm,3dux0v,Neon-man,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:18:13 2015 UTC,"Enter the Void has a good one, since the whole film is pretty much through the POV of one guy, although when he dies and begins his outer-body experience, the film can continue to go from his perspective without having to be in first person."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,lordhadri,13,Sun Jul 19 13:29:26 2015 UTC,"Black Book Paul Verhoeven, 2006: Leave it to Verhoeven to make a sexy Holocaust movie. Most people don’t watch his Dutch movies but I actually recommend checking this out if you’re tired of stuff like Valkyrie and The Imitation Game playing it too safe. In this one, Verhoeven dumps a bucket of shit on Carice van Houten’s naked body. But he also lets a Jewish collaborator and a Gestapo officer canoodle in a boat once they’re both fugitives from the vengeful Dutch. Black Book is full of kinky kindnesses like that.    The Tribe Miroslav Slaboshpitsky, 2014: I don’t normally like this sort of movie, but all the obvious reasons to dislike it have been stated already...so I’m going to say mostly positive things about it.  The Tribe shows us something that hearing people don’t always realize about signing languages, which is that they aren’t mere hand signal substitutions for vocalized language but are independent languages that utilize a full range of physical expression. Something very few movies do well is allow actors to use that range of expression. Point the camera at a face, have them say the relevant lines, and expect the audience to be able to understand what the lines mean and remember what the character’s name is and which movie star plays them.   A movie performed in signing language can’t get away with that, so the characters in The Tribe must be created through physicality and nonverbal communication. However, this communication isn’t solely visual as in a silent movie. The Tribe goes further than that and places us, invisible hearing people, as voyeurs on the lives of deaf teenagers. When you can look and listen to the settings for so long in unbroken takes you can practically smell them too, or run your fingers along the walls. This helps you understand who the characters are who exist in this space as well. The aesthetic rules of the movie remove all possibility of fantasy or visual expression and leaves only point-of-view and the actors; this culminates in a boiler room sex scene that is neither erotic cinema nor pornography but resembles how people might actually have casual intercourse in private.   The story is really going to be the sticking point for most people. I do think there’s a reason for it being this story. Mainstream cultures like to pretend they’re the only culture, even though they’re comprised of individuals with different backgrounds and allegiances and tastes. So English-speaking people assume everyone should speak English, law-abiding people assume nobody should becomes thieves, we confuse our own social preferences for ‘human nature’ and so on. The Tribe is about people who speak differently and think differently, so they establish their own hierarchies and moral codes with one another. Stories about schools often show this rigid, primitive structure, but by being in a totally differentmode of language, we understand that we are as aliens to this tribe of humans and get to discover our species all over again.  But that’s where it fell apart for me, as the movie’s depiction of violence and vaginal politics aren’t nearly as intriguing as I want them to be. There’s an unforgiveable lack of imagination towards the role of women in this primitive society: I doubt that in hypothetical caveman times it could be reduced to only prostitution and rape. It is a waste of a surprisingly great performance by the main actress. I also doubt actual deaf people will like this movie, as it never shows the deaf to be anything other than savages incapable of intelligence, humor, or defending themselves from the dangers of the hearing world or other deaf people.  Only after seeing a movie try to pull all this off will you understand, whether you like this movie or not, how much things like ‘story’ and ‘acting’ and ‘music’ really matter to you in cinema. In some ways I think the director shows poor judgment but it sure gave me a lot to think about. I hope someone tries a movie like this again someday, and does it in a smarter, funnier way.     Feel free to ask me for expanded thoughts on the rest, there’s plenty more to say:  Rewatch - Chinatown Roman Polanski, 1974: with commentary by screenwriter Robert Towne &  David Fincher. You can tell that Fincher is always trying to make movies he likes as much as he likes this one.  Rewatch- Bigger than Life Nicholas Ray, 1956: “God was wrong!”  Peeping Tom Michael Powell, 1960: More relevant today than ever.  Cartel Land Matthew Heineman, 2015  Ace in the Hole Billy Wilder, 1951  A Few Good Men Rob Reiner, 1992"

TrueFilm,3du0cj,lordhadri,2,Sun Jul 19 15:11:50 2015 UTC,"This is what I said on /r/flicks:   Ace on the Hole is one of his better-looking movies; all those deep shots of the desert in it. It also brazenly makes fun of the audience for coming to see this story about a man stuck in a hole. The trick it plays on you is something I don't like about a lot of other movies though: by letting you see yourself as the main character, it's everyone else in the audience who is a moron, not you.   To add to that, I'll watch just about any journalism movie. And I think the general dilemma here is interesting, with a person taking his bad impulses too far. And I liked how Kirk Douglas takes the place of the trapped husband in keeping the wife around for appearance's sake. But it doesn't really say more about media or humanity that just sneering at all of it. Also, Wilder's strategy is to have a character spell out exactly what's going to happen in dialogue, and then show it happening.  Most people like Wilder more than I do. :) Ace in the Hole is not a comedy and has an unhappy ending, so I was okay with it because it didn't make me as uncomfortable as some other Wilder movies do. I still think Kirk Douglas got the wrong comeuppance though: spoiler"
TrueFilm,3du0cj,isarge123,2,Sun Jul 19 15:26:49 2015 UTC,"Could you please expand on A Few Good Men?   I've loved it ever since I first saw it as a teenager, and I still think it's a very tightly constructed and well acted film."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,lordhadri,6,Sun Jul 19 14:55:54 2015 UTC,"I'll say this: I'll take Sorkin's writing over Billy Wilder's. A Few Good Men is middlebrow all the way through and Roger Ebert nailed it when he said it's a movie that ""tells you what it will do, does it, then tells you what it did."" Still, Sorkin puts plenty of details about the world and subterfuge between the characters and that's exactly what I felt was missing from Ace on the Hole, so I give it credit for that! It's also from that era of 1990s studio filmmaking when they'd figured out how to make movies watchable no matter how long they were or what they were about it. Good colors, movement within a frame. The actors in it are still with us and were good choices. Only the music is dated. (And the tension with Cuba is going that way.)  I can even forgive that strategy of explaining what will happen next because you're hearing it from lawyer characters and it anticipates how lawyers direct arguments in the courtroom scenes, turning the whole movie into a trial and making the audience the jury. So it kinda just works for this movie.  It made me think too; it reminded me of what bullies often do when trying to have their way and accuse you of not being a grown up or knowing how the world works. Yet Tom Cruise just spent the whole movie overcoming his complacency about the military. What he has to do is stick to that conviction in the face of a bigger, snarlier actor. The movie doesn't explain that bit either, it just lets you feel it. The actors pull it off beautifully.  We all face times in our lives when we need to choose to obey our own code or do nothing. Stronger people than you prefer you do nothing, so you have to be prepared to face the conflict that will cause for you. A Few Good Men is a pretty good contemplation of that problem.  I'm guessing there's a reason why ""You can't handle the truth!"" is the big quote from this movie and not Jessup's blowjob speech. But I love the scene in which Nicholson musses his dress uniform but then snaps it back to crisp in one move."

TrueFilm,3du0cj,montypython22,8,Mon Jul 20 13:02:03 2015 UTC,"You, the Living (Re-watch) Directed by Roy Andersson (2007)- When first watching the first two films in Anderssons “Living” trilogy I lamented their not being on blu-ray. Well now they are and look as good as they should. After the funny melancholy of Songs of the Second Floor Andersson brings a bit more warmth to You, the Living. In his world most people are unhappy but happiness is not unattainable. For the most part he shows that most of our inability to connect with others and be happy comes from all our similar failings. Everyone’s desperate to be heard but no one wants to listen, people lament being misunderstood as they make no attempt to understand those around them, and people aren’t honest with how they feel then resent others not understanding their feelings. It’s a comedic spiral of bad decisions and thoughtlessness that captures the way people really are. But cutting through the sadness is music. A universal connector that can brighten the darkest of times. If only we could be as good as the music we make. Andersson expands on the musical themes in really interesting ways in A Pigeon Sat on a Bench Reflecting on Existence but You the Living has a more optimistic portrayal of it. Re-watching this just confirms the Living trilogy as one of the greatest film trilogies for me alongside the Before series. It captures the deepest saddest truths of our lives and society while also containing one of the most beautifully touching sequences I’ve ever seen that imagines a world where we celebrate the happiness of others and for a moment it makes you believe that’s how we could be. Like the rest of the Living films it is insightful, funny, and cinematically captivating. Loved it just as much on re-watch.   Justice League: Gods and Monsters Directed by Sam Liu (2015)- DC are generally pretty good with the animated films but despite the out-there premise Gods and Monsters is one of their dullest. Set on an alternate earth where the Justice League kill and Superman was born of Zod’s blood and found on the US/Mexico Border it has a lot going on but little of it lands. If you’ve not seen any DC animated films before this it’d probably be more enjoyable but the fluid action and occasionally surprising violence has been done better in their other films. Only worth seeing if you want to see goatee Superman and Batman being a literal vampire who kills bad dudes.   Porco Rosso (Re-watch) Directed by Hayao Miyazaki (1992)- On this re-watch I think Porco Rosso has finally overtaken Princess Mononoke in my Miyazaki rankings. Like Mononoke it is a more focused portrayal of many of Miyazaki’s common themes but here they land even more strongly. It’s elegant, witty, and carries a sadness that makes the anti-war commentary resonate more than in any other Miyazaki film. Porco Rosso along with The Wind Rises is a film Miyazaki momentarily called a bit of a mistake (in the Kingdom of Dreams and Madness documentary) because they were the only two not made for children. Even though Porco has some of the humour of other Miyazaki films I can see what he means as it has an emotional maturity instead of the sometimes more simple and pure emotional motivations of his other films. Some of the most memorable lines in any Ghibli film get said by Porco like “I’d rather be a pig than a fascist” or “Farewell to freedom in the Adriatic and days of wild abandon” which have always stuck with me. One of my favourites that I liked even more this time around.    The Wolfpack Directed by Crystal Moselle (2015)- The Wolfpack’s good but it has that problem some documentaries with similarly wild stories can have. The core story is such a crazy situation that it often leaves you wishing the documentarian would probe deeper. Sure it’s fun seeing these kids re-enact their favourite films showing how these films really offered an escape for them but it also kind of sidesteps the clear abuse going on and some things feel ignored in favour of more uplifting fare. Like I didn’t even realise until reading an article after the film that the mentally disabled daughter of the family was the first born child, she in general basically gets ignored. It’s because it’s so much about the men of the family breaking the familial chains and finding who they are through oppression but it leaves you with a lot of questions and not the good kind. Worth seeing for the fascinating story and moments of brilliance but don’t expect to be wholly satisfied.   Thief Directed by Michael Mann (1981)- I dug Mann’s Manhunter but it did feel like prettied-up dullness at times. Other than Tom Noonan, Brian Cox, and a couple other actors everyone is really stale and it feels by-the-books procedural that happens to look amazing. Thief finally tied that visual brilliance with charismatic actors and a script that actually has use for these images beyond just looking pretty. One of the opening shots is one of the best establishing shots of a city’s underbelly I’ve ever seen. We start at the top of two buildings and start slowly gliding down, into the alley between them. It seems impossibly deep and with black on either side of the alley it’s as if we’ve been delving underground rather than returning to ground level. But soon James Caan finds himself less locked in the shadows and thrust into the light as he becomes embroiled with much more serious criminals. His transition isn’t really verbalised but visually Mann perfectly captures the slow shift he makes into the even more dangerous and inescapable world of crime. What makes the film work so well beyond the imagery is how sensitive it is. We’re in a harsh world but the emotions of our main characters are not as far gone as those of the people they’re involved with. There are levels of awfulness when it comes to those who take what they want. Not that Mann’s glorifying a world of honour among thieves or anything, he just shows more compassion towards those who aren’t all that bad and are a product of a system. And man the Tangerine Dream score is off the chain. One of those scores so cool I had to get it right after watching. Really glad I got the blu-ray as the colours pop and every shot has so much texture, plus it’s just a really nice looking Arrow release. Easily my favourite Mann film and one I liked so much it makes me think I ought to give Heat and fellow mod lordhadri’s favourite The Last of the Mohican’s. Might even see Blackhat as it had its Mann-head defenders.   The Exterminating Angel Directed by Luis Bunuel (1962)- For no discernible reason a bunch of aristocrats find themselves unable to leave the room of the host of a dinner party. It seems like all the little unspoken rules of etiquette have come to punish them and strip them down until no semblance of etiquette and superiority is left. The Exterminating Angel has immediately jumped to being my favourite of Bunuel’s I’ve seen. It has the striking absurdity of his other films but seems even more pointed and purposeful than ever. He’s tearing down the social hierarchy and then in a great horror-movie-esque ending widens his critical reach to all structures with power (namely religion). What I loved was that it had the surreal elements he’s known for but felt even more connected to a reality than I’ve seen. There’s logic in how the rich folk test the bounds of their imprisonment and work around it but it’s in a wholly illogical world. It makes his critiques land even harder as they’re more explicitly embedded in a truth. He’s got no respect for those he’s taking down and I love it, because they don’t deserve it. They’ve made a prison of ignorance, privilege, and empty manners, and now they have to live in it thoroughly unprepared. It’s like a Bunuel episode of The Twilight Zone and just as good as that sounds  Wanderlust Directed by David Wain (2012)- They Came Together really surprised me considering the general critical perception of it as it’s one of the funniest comedies in recent years. Some critics just don’t gel with what Wain does. So I watched Wanderlust hoping it was similarly tear-inducing hilarious but it’s not quite there. Jennifer Aniston is not nearly the comedic presence of Rudd’s co-star in They Came Together (Amy Poehler) and that’s where the problems begin. Weirdly this is almost the kind of film They Came Together is poking fun at. It’s got some laughs, some Wain weirdness, but it’s more tied down by convention and simply less funny than Wet Hot or They. It doesn’t even have as much going on visually as some of the Wain directed episodes of Children’s Hospital. So it’s lesser Wain but it has some laughs mainly due to it’s cast of brilliant improvisers and cool cats like Alan Alda."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,isarge123,6,Sun Jul 19 13:29:42 2015 UTC,"Mon Oncle Directed by Jaques Tati (1958)- Tati doesn’t just tell stories. He creates little worlds, his own version of types of places that are familiar, and each film is like spending a couple hours in that world. I think that’s part of why Mr Hulot’s Holiday didn’t wholly work for me. As each film is a different place, a different vibe, each vibe will resonate differently depending on the viewer. Mon Oncle brought me back to loving Tati. It has the brilliant choreography, gentle observational and absurd humour, and even more striking compositions. Seeing Tati come to colour is a delight, enriching his world even more. It’s non stop pleasantness, warmth, and laughs.   Alien³ (Re-watch) Directed by David Fincher (1992)- This is only technically a re-watch as I think I’d seen the theatrical cut first time around. For the first 45-50 minutes I was pretty into it. There was more recognisable Fincher than I’d remembered and even though it doesn’t intrigue me as much as Vincent Ward’s original wooden planet idea it sets up an interesting world and set of characters. Yet it somehow still gets so dull for me. Ridley Scott works with an even more cramped environment for most of his Alien film yet it is not nearly as visually repetitive as this. By the end I was so tired of the endless similar looking metal corridors. Scott works in black and blues while Fincher brings more of a muddiness to things that somehow makes it look cheaper than I imagine it was. Lots of ideas are thrown around but by the end none of them landed in more than a superficial way. Some good gore shots, shame what’s causing the gore rarely looks as good. It’s certainly not the catastrophe it’s somewhat known as but neither is it really the hidden masterpiece for me."

TrueFilm,3du0cj,isarge123,5,Sun Jul 19 16:05:29 2015 UTC,Do it man. Some older films look like they were shot yesterday somehow with actors who are dead. Seeing John Carpenter films on blu-ray made me completely rethink how I viewed him as a visual director with some films as the clarity made his simple yet crisp compositions pop as they're meant to. When I first got a blu-ray player one of the discs it came with was The Wizard of Oz on blu-ray and dvd. I had it playing on my blu-ray player and one copy in the Xbox so I could switch between channels and see the difference for myself. After seeing the colour and glory I switched to the DVD and it looked like the film had been filtered through gravy. I'm all about the blu-ray baby.
TrueFilm,3du0cj,montypython22,2,Sun Jul 19 16:17:39 2015 UTC,"I mean plenty of good DVDs exist, I'd be fine watching any Malick movie that way on my personal TV at least. But I bought The Searchers this week and instantly regretted it because while it's fine I realized the Blu is probably better. It depends on the movie at this point. The Peeping Tom blu I watched yesterday had similar flaws to the Thief DVD for example.  Maybe I should start buying dual editions."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,calcio1,2,Sun Jul 19 16:34:11 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah definitely. And conversely some blu-ray transfers are poorly done so the difference is barely there. Or they go too far with the colours or something. One of the problems is needing to read up on quality before buying. Like apparently the Hitchcock collection that came out a while ago had colours all out of whack. Usually the big cool distributers like Arrow, Eureka, Studio Canal, and BFI are good for quality. The Herzog Collection from BFI is spectacular. Yeah I only have The Thin Red Line on dvd and it hasn't bothered me much but then again seeing all the pores on Brad Pitt and loose strands of Jessica Chastains hair in Tree of Life is the bomb."

TrueFilm,3du0cj,isarge123,4,Mon Jul 20 04:51:01 2015 UTC,"It's a mostly chronological order, except I've put Trafic ahead of Play Time, because the former is a more conventional Hulot (still crazy original, of course). Most people watch Trafic after the truly original Play Time and underrate the second one for being a lesser film. I like to think of Trafic as not lesser quality but of smaller reach. This order prevents that from happening, saving Play Time for next-to-last."

TrueFilm,3du0cj,MooseAtMovies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:40:44 2015 UTC,"I think we may just be on different wavelengths with regards to the Alien franchise, but I liked the theatrical cut of Alien3—it's a half hour shorter than the assembly one which may explain the dullness. Also, I liked how cheap everything looked. That—along with the retro prison setting and religious order, Fincher's direction (particular the pov shots), the costuming (particularly the Weyland-Yutani guy so), and a lot more—gave the film, I found, an almost modern day expressionistic vibe that I dug a lot."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,MooseAtMovies,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:51:40 2015 UTC,"I was ok with that aesthetic early on because it was shot so strikingly like in a standard ""guys walk into warehouse"" shot the doorway is the only thing lit and slightly askew. It creates a great sense of space with just a doorway and a lot of darkness. But there were less flourishes like that by the end. I will give you that, Lance Hendrickson looks great when he shows up. To be fair it's hard to get past my adoration of the first film. My love for it got me to watch all the sequels, the Aliens vs Predators, and even read a couple of comics, but none have really lived up to it for me. Once a film has lodged in like that it's hard to shake."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,afewthoughtsonfilm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:13:17 2015 UTC,"It it is odd how Alien3 seems to decline chronologically, you can tell where it happens too, and though we know it had a messy production I doubt they were filming chronologically? I think the ending is pretty good though. The way it falls apart in terms of theme in that second half is what keep it from being outright great, IMO."

It's the only one I've seen so far, but it's one of my personal favorites of the films I've seen this year.  I ordered the new Blu-ray set, but it won't be here for another two weeks (damn you, international shipping!)  And I'm totally with you on Mon Oncle.  When I first watched M. Hulot's Holiday, I was fairly neutral on Tati's stuff (although upon revisitation, it does get much better I found), but Mon Oncle really knocks it way out of the park.  The brunch scene alone is downright hysterical and is one of the best moments in Tati's career."

You, the Living and A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence are the only two of the three to hit me emotionally but Songs From the Second Floor has one of the most memorable scenes and also since it was my first Andersson has a special place. They're all great as one, too hard to rank."

One of the first ones I saw was Wonder Woman and very few have lived up to that. Lauren Montgomery really needs to direct more of these things. The fight at the end of Justice League Doom (I think that's the one anyway) is probably one of the best superhero battles I've seen.   Son of Batman was a bummer. Some of the league of owls stuff was cool but yeah Throne of Atlantis had more going on. The ones with more members of the Justice League in general seem to work better as there are more powers and characters to show off.

TrueFilm,3du0cj,isarge123,4,Sun Jul 19 23:23:02 2015 UTC,"I am on letterboxd, for those who are interested   Summary:   It’s been a really busy past couple of weeks for me, so I haven’t been able to binge-watch like I’d like to.  That being said, I saw some really great stuff this week that I’m excited to share!   What I Watched This Week (in no particular order)    The New World (2005) dir. Terrence Malick – More than anything else, The New World proved to me that I shouldn’t underestimate Malick as an artist.  Given that the subject matter of the film is the colonization of Jamestown, I figured the subtext of this film would be fairly obvious, something to the effect of “the consequences of man dominating nature”, etc.  But Malick, ever the romantic, instead focuses his attention on something far greater: the importance of love in human relations.  The pivotal moment in this film is when Pocahontas throws herself in front of John Smith to prevent his execution, from which Malick turns the film into a Romeo & Juliet-esque tale of doomed love.  It should be noted, however, that the love Malick describes isn’t exclusively romantic love, but also fraternal love, love of life.  In his next film, The Tree of Life, Malick will draw a distinction between men and women, describing men adhering to “the way of nature,” which is a violent, self-serving path, and women adhering to “the way of grace,” which is a kinder, gentler, and more loving path.  Although never directly expressed in those terms, this philosophy can be felt in each Malick film and The New World is no different – this film makes clear the belief that the violence of the relationship between the male settlers and the male natives only brings about despair for both sides and how Pocahontas’s kindness and love is the only way to true bliss. Depending on the film, different elements of Malick’s cinematic ability shine through.  In Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line, his sound design is exquisite and adds great depth to the piece.  In The New World, it is his editing that works the best, visually reflecting the conflict within John Smith’s head over the nasty, brutish, and short way of life he experiences at Jamestown and the warm, loving, free life experiences in his time with Pocahontas.  And, of course, his visual style is here in full force. Unfortunately, this is the first Malick film that I wasn’t completely in love with.  I found the cut I saw (the 176 minute version) to be a bit long in the tooth towards the end, in which they introduce another character that didn’t seem to add much to the story as I saw it.  That being said, a lesser Malick film is still leaps and bounds ahead of what so many do in cinema that I still found this film to be absolutely exceptional. The Home and the World (1984) dir. Satyajit Ray - In the first image of The Home and the World, Satyajit Ray foreshadows the doom that is to come.  In it, a large, crackling fire is seen in the distance, surrounded by darkness.  For me personally, this moment has special resonance; it was the very first image in a Ray film I've seen to feature color.  Much like the opening of The Music Room, in which the opulent white chandelier swings ominously amidst a dark backdrop, the contrast of the bright orange against the utter blackness is a warning to the audience that something serious is to come in this film. On one level, this film is a romance.  A husband, insecure about his wife's dogmatic following of Indian tradition that forces women to be devoted to their husband, invites an old friend to meet his wife.  The husband tells his wife that she may befriend him as well in order to give her a sense of personal autonomy in choosing the man she loves.  That friend, played by longtime Ray collaborator Soumitra Chatterjee, is seductively charming, leading to an inevitable love triangle between the three people in a manner not unlike Ray's earlier film Charulata (I'll note parenthetically that this is the third instance in which Chatterjee plays a character who creates a love triangle between the characters - an interesting typecast for him to fall into).  Ray handles this material like the best of any soap opera, pushing in on character's faces during heated emotional moments, using the camera to underscore passionate moments. Yet, underneath the complicated romance lies deep political allegories.  The two suitors for the wife, played by Swatilekha Sengupta, represent not only two different love interests but also two different ideologies.  Chatterjee's character is the leader of a growing resistance to British and foreign-supplied goods in India, arguing they are causing a rift within Indian society.  He speaks of revolution and, when we first meet him in the film, has already galvanized a huge crowd of people all across Bengal.  To many, including Sengupta's character, these cries for independence from foreign investors is alluring and strikes a cord.  Not as convinced is Sengupta's husband, played by Victor Banerjee.  He represents the foil to Chatterjee's character, a man who is invested in the lives of the impoverished Muslims in Bengal, recognizing the potential danger such economic independence could bring.  Choosing one man over the other implies not only an acceptance of their love but also an endorsement of what they represent. But the stakes of the film are much higher than this simple romance and, unlike other Ray films, the scope of this film is far larger.  What Ray warns of is not unlike what Hungarian filmmaker Béla Tarr would explore in Werckmeister Harmonies 16 years later: the consequences that arise when mob mentality as a means of social reform.  As impassioned as he is, Chatterjee's character is a snake-oil salesmen.  Despite what he preaches, he acknowledges that even he cannot do what he asks others to do, smoking foreign cigarettes being his only exception.  Though perhaps just in his ideologies, they are, as Banerjee's character will point out, only valuable in the abstract; when implementing them into a real society, they are far from pragmatic.  In order to make them work, he has to use terror tactics - burning houses, stealing clothes, destroying property - in order to force the public to comply.  As more of his position is truly revealed, the more sinister it becomes. Through The Home and the World, Ray reminds us how violence begets violence and of the consequences mob mentality creates.  He warns how it harms not only the present, but also the future, as the youth are swept up in the heat of revolution and abandon the bright futures their education offered them.  He does not suggest idle obedience - early in the film, Banerjee's character quips that he ""[doesn't] think tradition should be followed blindly"" - but rather that caution should be taken when bringing change and that ideological extremism is never the appropriate route to true freedom.  We see the tragedy that such a route can bring in the final moments of this film, an ending that could only have been made better with a recording of Marlon Brando whispering ""the horror"". A Poem is a Naked Person (2015) dir. Les Blank - The more Les Blank I see, the more infatuated I become with his approach to documentary (and cinema in general).  A Poem is a Naked Person, simultaneously his first and, as a result of being shelved for 41 years, his last feature, is billed as a documentary on musician Leon Russell at the heigh of his career.  However, this description is fairly misleading and is hardly representative of the content of the film.  Blank isn't concerned with creating a portrait of Leon Russell - I went into this film knowing nothing about him and came out just as ignorant - but instead creating a piece that encapsulates life, death, and the pleasures of the human experience.  In his essay on Blank, Andrew Horton writes, ""It was Blank's religion, as he often suggested, to rejoice in the pleasures of living,"" and this belief shines through in all of his works.  Intercut between sequences of Russell performing on stage are snippets of others Blank encountered on the making of this documentary: in one moment, we see a father and son fishing for giant catfish; in another, we watch a sports parachuting competition and a man who, as a toast to the event, chews on a glass cup; in another, a young flower girl at a wedding wants nothing more than to sing into the boom mic for Blank and his crew; in another, a famous surrealist artist captures scorpions in his empty pool; in another, a building is demolished before a crowd, who rush to get pieces of the rubble.  None of these moments have anything to do with Russell, but are typical in a Blank picture. In tying all of these moments together, Blank is able to achieve something really special, a tribute to the diversity of life and the little ways we all find happiness.  As one of the subjects quips near the end, ""There's no end to greatness and beauty.""  No statement better sums up Blank's view of the world."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,lordhadri,2,Sun Jul 19 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"Lonesome (1929) dir. Paul Fejos - Oh my God, what a crazy ride this film is!  There isn't anything about this story that is particularly new or inventive, nothing hugely insightful it has to say.  However, what I admire so much about Fejos is his willingness to try his hand at a huge variety of techniques, many highly experimental.  Although much of the film is black & white and silent, there is the occasional sound scene and even color scene.  These moments serve no purpose other than as experiments with burgeoning techniques and technologies, yet it is so admirable to see someone who is willing to see what these new techniques can bring.  I can't think of another film as experimental with new technologies other than Godard's Goodbye to Language from last year (which, other than just using 3D in an experimental way, also made use of a variety of different cameras (such as GoPros) and approaches).  This is a really special film, one that shows great mastery of silent cinema (and featuring some remarkable photography, notably on the boardwalk during a huge ticker-tape celebration) and a willingness to try new things.   This week I also rewatched Apichatpong Weerasethakul's Blissfully Yours (2002) and watched Satyajit Ray's An Enemy of the People (1989) and King Vidor's silent masterpiece, The Crowd (1928).  I also watched 5 Kenneth Anger shorts, with the best one I've seen so far being the incredible (and slightly Satanic) Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954).  When I finish going through his filmography, I'll add more thoughts on Anger.  But, for now, feel free to comment if there are any thoughts you want me to expand on!"
TrueFilm,3du0cj,isarge123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:37:06 2015 UTC,"Well at least you saw the longest possible version of the New World. I still haven't and the second time I saw the theatrical version I came out thinking it was too short. John and Pocahontas often talk about 'what they knew in the forest' and stuff and I felt like the movie didn't take enough time to actually build that connection and most of the movie is the collapse of a relationship I never got that invested in anyway. Supposed Pocahontas rip-off Avatar spends like 40 minutes of an action movie just hanging out with Jake and Neytiri in the rainforest.   I'll have to get to that long version sometime. It's the Malick I have the hardest time liking...To The Wonder makes it unnecessary, I think, as it says pretty much the same thing without hiding underneath a costume drama movie, and a well-worn story already done right by Disney at that."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,lordhadri,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:46:54 2015 UTC,"How much time in the shorter cuts is spent with John Rolfe?  For me, that was what ended up going on for longer than necessary; the parts with John Smith and Pocahontas were appropriately paced.  Given what I hear about To The Wonder, I imagine I'll feel the same.  I still like many parts of The New World - it does capture the awe and confusion of the clash of cultures fairly well, particularly in the fight sequences between the natives and the colonists - but I agree that it's far from his best.  For me, The Thin Red Line, Days of Heaven, and The Tree of Life are all duking it out for first place, I really can't choose between them as to which I like the most."

Beautiful use of color, decent pacing, and great action. Editing can be jarring at times and cause confusion of who is who. But what I love the most from this picture is Suzuki's pop art aesthetic. The colors, soundtrack and story are just so well put together 8/10  Seijun Suzuki's Branded To Kill (1967) I watched this two days ago and that's what caused me to go out and pick up Tokyo Drifter. Only a year after Tokyo Drifter Suzuki released Branded To Kill. The film is simple, that's what I love about it. The Choice to abstain from color in this film seems to suggest simple is what Suzuki wanted. Jô Shishido brilliantly plays the role of a yakuza hit man who botched a job. Now the higher ups are after him. Brilliantly paced, and interesting from start to finish. The 3rd act is particularly well done. 9.5/10   Wong Kar-Wai's Chungking Express(1994) My friend recently got a copy of this out of print feature in the collection and I had to watch. Two tales of two cops who fall in love is a beautiful masterpiece of romantic cinema. I enjoy the first story more than the second  simply based off the amazing scene with Brigitte Lin herding around a pack of Indians. But the second story has the beautifully adorable Faye Wong. I really enjoy the use of pop music in the second story. California Dreaming will forever be stuck in me head. 9/10  Charles Chaplin's City Lights (1931) &amp; Modern Times (1936) I recently picked up pretty much everything from Chaplin The collection had to offer. City lights was the first I chose to watch, and I Immediately Followed it up with Modern Times. What can I say that hasn't been said about these films. Chaplin is the master. I particularly enjoyed The first drinking scene with the rich man in City Lights, and I loved the singing and dancing in the last scene of Modern Times. City Lights 10/10 Modern Times 10/10  Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men (1957) Another Classic, that I feel like I have nothing I can add because it's all been said before. Genius writing, impeccable Pacing, Brilliant Performances. 10/10"
TrueFilm,3du0cj,SenseiMike3210,8,Sun Jul 19 20:27:09 2015 UTC,"I have reviewed most of these on my Letterboxd, too, so feel free to check those out: http://letterboxd.com/montypython22/  In order of preference:  Shoot The Piano Player (François Truffaut, 1960): ★★★★★  In ""Tirez sur le pianiste"", François Truffaut, true to his piano-playing hero Charlie, plays all the right notes in a devastating, hilarious, cheeky, and ultimately tragic story about a sweet-hearted piano virtuouso, the women in his life, and the crime syndicate that refuses to let him live out his days in peace. I have never been more involved with a noir-esque loner protagonist than Truffaut's Charlie; he is the kind of guy you wish many crime capers had at their center, but never do. Charlie is everything you DON'T expect in a leading male: he's sedate, he's understanding of his partner's problems, he's timid, and he actually respects women.  I am definitely more a Truffaut man than a Godard man. Godardphiles will say that Godard takes it one step further, but I personally feel no fun in his hollow cinema, which is all about making a joke out of everything. Truffaut jokes, too, but he interweaves that with these characters imbued with a tragic sense of finality. He feels savage feelings. I think that if you REALLY want to show audiences that you love the cinema, better to take the Truffaut route: make the story and the characters, not the technique, the main draw. QUIETLY subvert. See the beauty in all people, and the joy in making movies, but don't let it ever become a rigorous chore. And, above all, make me feel something. The savage emotions of delight, dismay, confusion, and unbelievable sadness are all contained in Tirez sur le pianist, a humble ode to an even humbler pianist.  Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles  (Chantel Akerman, 1975): (no rating)  There comes a movie every once in a while that really sweeps in and knocks you off your ass. It gets you tense, unable to breathe at times out of excitement of what you're seeing. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles is that kind of movie. You are watching a woman's life and her closeted universe unfold right before your very eyes. This does not feel like 200 minutes. Delphine Seyrig’s “performance”—if you can even call it that, it strips away the pretentions of acting and goes into a different realm—is one for the ages. One of the most poignant moments of the film is when Jeanne Dielman, in her hypnotic and silent daily funk, goes to her bedroom, turns on the light, and just stands there for 10 seconds staring into dead space. Then she realizes what she’s doing, turns off the light, and leaves. How many of us haven’t done that before? I refuse to rate this. This is an experimental work of true greatness that doesn't deserve flippant stars.  El Angel Exterminador (re-watch) (Luis Bunuel, 1962): ★★★★★  My favorite Buñuel. It's a strange trip with no answer; I'm not sure Buñuel himself cared to explain why the aristocrats cannot leave the living-room. It is loads of surrealistic fun, nonetheless, with sheep leading sheep and an ending that, in a brisk 3 minutes, completely decimates religious institutions.  The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, 1943): ★★★★★  When I’m an old decrepit man, I’ll ask for only two movies to be played ad infinitum at all times: Les Demoiselles de Rochefort and The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp. It’s a jolly good time with smashing performances. The greatest moment is when Anton “Auteur” Walbrook delivers an emotional monologue on the effect of Nazism and how he feels like an alien to a bunch of British bureaucrats who cannot possibly understand how hard his life has been. Brilliant stuff.  Love Streams (John Cassavetes, 1984): ★★★★1/2  Another home-run for John Cassavetes, who delivers what could be his finest masterpiece yet, in Love Streams. I’m still trying to figure out the purpose for some of the decisions in the final act of Love Streams—notably, the symbolic inclusion of a naked-dog-man in the home of the lead protagonist—but it’s a truly bold, bizarre concoction. The brother and sister of the film (played by husband-and-wife-team Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands) are both deprived of love at every juncture in their increasingly-meaningless lives. But just when they’re able to find love with each other, the other yanks themselves away at the chance of a new life with their old past. It’s a very subdued story, but one which is told with breathtaking originality and contains some of the most memorable scenes in Cassavetes’ oeuvre. Not the least of which is this surrealistic, Fosse-esque ballet between Gena Rowlands, Seymour Cassel (her recently divorced husband), and their daughter who hates Rowlands. Definitely worth checking out.  Who Killed Who? (Tex Avery, 1944): ★★★★1/2  They don’t make cartoons like this one anymore. Tex Avery delivers the goods in a rampant, no-holds-barred parody of detective stories.  Simon del Desierto (re-watch) (Luis Bunuel, 1965): ★★★★1/2  Silvia Pinal can do no wrong. And the ending qualifies as one of the greatest twists in all of moviedom. Fuck Kael for saying it’s not feasible within the film’s vantage point. With Bunuel, anything goes.  Belle de Jour (Luis Bunuel, 1967): ★★★★1/2  Still processing this chesnut. I’ve got only one word: “Hmmmm….”  You see, Bunuel wants you to find meaning in the final scene. Bunuel wants you to question and to make you wonder about the trajectory of the film, how it’s an erotica movie that manages to dance around the actual penetration.   But of course, seeing as it’s Bunuel, I may find myself just running and circles and saying, “Fuck it. Catherine Deneuve is a goddess. Bunuel is a mischievous imp. They’ve had their fun. On with my day!”  Jules et Jim (François Truffaut, 1961): ★★★1/2  After the hi-powered antix of Shoot the Piano Player, I feared anything that FT made afterward would pale in comparison. Jules et Jim proves me partially right.  It's a formidable first half—almost entirely narrated, it recounts the disastrous love triangle between Catherine (Jeanne Moreau), a deliriously impulsive woman who switches between would-be suitors Jules (Oskar Werner, who picks up where the Charles Aznavour-played Charlie from Tirez left off) and Jim (Henri Serre) faster than she switches stockings. It all starts off happy, idyllic, and stylistically bold as Truffaut continues his Tirez-techniques: fast-cuts, jumpy camera, kinetic camera glides that get us to understand the non-stop fun between J, J, and C.  But unfortunately, somewhere along the way, FT loses sight of the ferocity of the story, and I lose interest in the film's second half. It's beating a dead horse for 40 minutes--Catherine is a bitch, Jules is a wimp, Jim doesn't know who to side with. And its ending—a one-way ticket to Atlantis courtesy of J & C—is so ridiculous, you can't help but laugh. It all ends rather suddenly, and we feel like we haven't gotten anywhere with our protagonists. Pity, since the first half holds so much promise.  Catherine may be crazy or what have you, but I much prefer Moreau's subdued Jackie in Demy's Bay of Angels, who is just as flirty as Catherine, but who is accorded this air of GENUINE mystique and seductiveness that makes you understand why men are so batty about her.  The Three Musketeers (Richard Lester, 1973): ★★★  Well, even masters have a bad day. This is a good attempt at transferring the Dumas book to the screen, but it’s…kind of hollow. It’s devoid of the Lester antix that I enjoy so much. He only settles for these very obvious gags that have very little payoff in the long-run, unlike Tati, whose gags are anti-gags and that’s why they’re funny.   The Cat’s Meow (Peter Bogdanovich, 2001): ★★★  The artsy justification of TMZ.  Bogdavonich is trying to be Altman here, I guess, but it doesn't work; oftentimes, his satire comes off as so irritatingly obvious you want to bash yourself over the head. Jennifer Tilly as the banshee gossip-columnist Luella Parsons is just a dumber version of Geraldine Chaplin's Opal in Nashville. There's an equally insipid monologue halfway through about ""the Hollywood Curse"" and its symptoms (i.e., you think you're the most important person in the room, your moral compass permanently switches off). It doesn't work the way Bogdanovich wants it to, however. He cuts to a close-up to Chaplin on the line ""you think you're the most important person in the room"", when, in fact, Chaplin had EVERY reason to think he was the most important person in ANY room. And the final narration, solemnly reminding us that Hollywood actors cover up scandals in their lives with money, is both preachy and an unnecessary way to moralize a picture that isn't worth a damn beyond being a juicy mel-lore-drama about how Chaplin wanted to fuck a girl and Hearst shot a guy that looked like the Tramp to get back at her.   Still, though, what a juicy story it is. Even though Bogdavonich does spend half the picture reminding you how everything is probably based on hearsay and that this version is probably illogical and probably mostly wrong. Fuck that! Just be straight with me and give me some juicy gossip trash and let's leave it at that."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,lordhadri,2,Sun Jul 19 15:07:45 2015 UTC,"Glad to see you appreciated Jeanne Dielman as much as I did. One thing you didn't mention is the windows in the film. They give across a post-apocalyptic feel, and make the later actions all the more relatable, due to the uneasiness of the atmosphere. Did you get a similar impression?"
TrueFilm,3du0cj,ryl00,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:51:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm, the windows motif (there was one?) didn't enter my mind. One thing that did stick out in my mind, however, upon reflection, were how certain tics of hers remain unexplained. For instance, on the first two days, punctually and on-the-dot, the final act that Dielman and the teenaged son do is put on their coats, go outside, and....well, that's just it. Akerman doesn't explain what they do. She only shows us a pitch-black exterior shot where it's hard to discern where the two are going. The next shot is of the two of them returning to the apartment and doing the normal nightly routine before heading to bed. But it irritates me (in a pleasant, Bunuelian way) that I can't understand where the hell they go every night. The way Akerman weaves it into Dielman's routine, however, suggests that, like the act I describe above, these are simply part of her ritualized habits. She's like an automaton doing these compulsive actions without really thinking about these complications. Instead of trying to break the palpable awkwardness between her and her son, she relies on her old habits to get her (temporarily) out of her funk. She tells him to ""get your coat, we're leaving."" And they do so. But Akerman never explains for what reason.  What made the final act relatable and not out-of-the-blue were the nightly chats, though. Both are extremely crucial, because they're the only expository conversations we get in the entire film, and they're both about the missing father. That, coupled with the fact that she's looking at a photograph of her and her husband before she does the thing, help us understand her motivations a bit more."

I'm surprised you never noticed the flashing windows, which always made it appear to be a storm, but no storm was ever mentioned, heard, or seen. It looks like constant thunder over and over throughout the entire night scenes, and the windows are somewhat visible in every cut. Again, you can pass it off as a storm, but even when they leave, a storm isn't shown. The windows are just flashing for no apparent reason."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,lordhadri,6,Mon Jul 20 03:18:42 2015 UTC,"Incendies (2010), Denis Villeneuve ★★★★★  I was looking over Denis Villeneuve's filmography (Prisoners (2013), Enemy (2013)) after I saw the trailer for his new film coming out in September, Sicario (2015), and saw that I have not seen Incendies (2010).  Made three years before Enemy and Prisoners, all three have a different director of photography. You can tell you're watching a Denis Villeneuve film though. In some of the cityscape scenes, you can feel the dread as was evident in Enemy, and almost expect a skyscraper sized arachnid as you see the smoke from the burning buildings. Incendies will keep you on your toes and you won't know where the 130 minutes went.  I gave it 9/10 aka 5 star after the first viewing. Since it's a library check out, I have it for 7 days, so I watched it again the second day. Even though it's near impossible to not figure out what you just saw, I missed so many things the first time around. I still had to hit pause, fast rewind, to catch a few things. Third viewing and I still picked up on what I missed. Especially when characters find out new information, and what they knew (or thought they new) up to that point. I just bought the dvd / blu combo pack mentioned in dvdbeaver.  Chocolat (1988), Claire Denis ★★★★★  Claire Denis' first film. She was Wim Wenders' first assistant director on Wings of Desire (1987), and Jim Jarmusch's assistant director on Down by Law (1986).  As in her 2009 White Material, it stars Isaach De Bankolé - who stars in Jarmusch's Night on Earth (1991), Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999), Coffee and Cigarettes (2003), and The Limits of Control (2009).  Pay attention to the opening scene, which starts out as a still picture of an ocean beach. You see something in the foreground, then in the background a figure appears out of nowhere. You wonder who's pov you are seeing as the camera pans right to the observer. Take note of her name.  edit: motw - Incendies"
TrueFilm,3du0cj,ryl00,4,Sun Jul 19 13:59:20 2015 UTC,"Amy (2015), Asif Kapadia ★★★★  There is so much of popular culture that just goes over my head. This probably has something to do with not owning a smart phone and watching only two tv channels: Turner Classic Movies and local weather on the 8s (The Weather Channel). I did not have a clue with respect to Amy Winehouse. The story is so captivating, and her talent so apparent, I was glued and am glad I made a special trip and caught this on the big screen. One of Ebert.com's reviewers, Susan Wloszczyna, who I may or may not take recommendations from her star ratings, gave it 4 (out of 4) stars, so off I went, across town - $8.50 for a senior ticket. Well worth the drive, ticket price. The performances shown depict a seasoned professional practicing her art.  Elles (2011), Malgorzata Szumowska ★★★★  Elles, with Juliette Binoche getting caught up in her work, reminds me of Sean Baker's Starlet (2012) a lot - but the later is a much better film, and if you didn't notice, his new film Tangerine (2015) is playing (though not in this town yet).  About Elly (2015), Asghar Farhadi ★★★  About Elly starts seeming too idyllic. The performances at times seem forced, though the subject matter quickly goes south. I had to make an amazon uk region 2 purchase to see this. I think I need another viewing maybe next week.  Out of the Furnace (2013), Scott Cooper ★★★  Formulaic. Predictable. A worthy library dvd check out.  Maps to the Stars (2015), David Cronenberg ★★★★  Rewatch."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,samwellian,8,Sun Jul 19 20:17:19 2015 UTC,"Margin Call (2011) - Dir. J.C. Chandor: I loved J.C. Chandor's All Is Lost, so I decided I should check out his first feature before I watch A Most Violent Year. His direction is good but doesn't feel quite as confident yet, but his intricate, layered screenplay, excellent performances, sturdy visuals and tight pacing make a damn compelling film. It's set in the 24 hour period before the stock market crash, as Zachary Quinto, Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Stanley Tucci and other talented performers first try to diffuse the situation, and then when it becomes apparent that it can't be diffused, try to contain it. Chandor infuses palpable tension into a movie that mostly consists of people talking about numbers, and the cast are able to provide character that doesn't always fully appear in the script (forgivable considering that the film's premise doesn't allow for much exposition). A late night flight probably wasn't the best time to watch such a dialogue-focused film, but I was riveted nonetheless. 8.5/10    Kingsman: The Secret Service (2015) - Dir. Matthew Vaughn: Kingsman: The Secret Service is a true oddity, in that I feel guilty for enjoying it so much. It's tonally misguided and occasionally repulsively tasteless, but a lot of fun. I've seen it both heavily criticised and largely praised on this sub, and I think I understand both sides of the argument. It has its flaws for sure, but manages to maintain a bold freshness and wit throughout that created a mostly enjoyable experience. I must admit that I am not a fan of the infamous church scene. Matthew Vaughn tries to make us not care morally about the massacre by inserting a bad-ass Colin Firth and a funny pop-song, but it doesn't hide the fact that heaps of innocent people are brutally savaged. The violence would be more palatable if the rest of the film was similarly graphic (it feels entirely random and used simply for shock value), and if there was actual choreography involved, rather than a random mess of shootings, stabbings, burnings, electrocutions and impalings. Edgar Wright used bloody violence much better in Hot Fuzz (2007): it was maintained throughout, was used in a justifiable context within the story and was obvious in its parody (making fun of overblown, excessively violent action films). It might seem like I hated the movie, but I certainly didn't. What it did right it did right rather well. The best aspect of the film is it's performances. Newcomer Taron Edgerton is fantastic, and shows great promise. Colin Firth convinced me he could have been a great Bond (and maybe still could?) and his dedication to stuntwork impressed me. The choice to give the distinctive, often imitated Samuel L. Jackson a lisp, is a cheap, but nonetheless effective gag. Jackson's ability to make everything he says hilarious is utilised fully and elevated some of the more meandering scenes to amusing ones. Mark Strong was also impressive, and was perhaps the most subtly funny character. It's technically solid and has great performances, which just manage to overcome its worrying moral scale. 6.5/10    The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies (2014) - Dir. Peter Jackson: Sigh. I really shouldn't have to say much more. A disappointing trilogy was capped off by an even more disappointing finale. A mess of inconclusive story arcs, overuse of unfinished CGI, poorly handled plot points and characters, stale dialogue, bland action, gravity (and canon) defying Legolas and cringeworthy comic-relief. The performances and the cinematography are impressive, but this whole trilogy feels lost in the editing room. The first two films were two long, while this one felt too short. We have about 90 minutes of battle sequences and then a conclusion that doesn't really conclude anything. I feel like the filmmakers filmed enough footage to make a good trilogy, and then wasted it in post-production. 4.5/10    Paddington (2014) - Dir. Paul King: Probably the best family film of 2014, though I haven't yet seen The Tales Of Princess Kagyuga. I loved Paddington even more than the first time I saw it. Witty, whimsical with charming comedy and outstanding visuals. The plot is simple but effective, and it poses some surprisingly thoughtful questions about asylum seekers and how we as humans treat the strangers amongst us. Well worth seeing, whether you're with children or without.  9/10    EDIT: I've been informed that Princess Kagyuga is NOT a family film."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,clearncopius,7,Sun Jul 19 13:40:03 2015 UTC,"Rebel Without A Cause (1955) - Dir. Nicholas Ray: This was an immensely powerful experience. The first I'd seen of James Dean's three films, and I can't wait to finish his tragically short filmography. Rebel Without A Cause shook me to the core. It's such an emotionally rich and thematically layered film, and I was overwhelmed by the spectacular finale. It runs less than two hours, yet manages to give you a personal insight into practically every significant character and the way they think, and by the end of the film (which only spans a twenty-four hour period) you are fully aware of how they and they're relationships of changed. Every performance is pitch-perfect, the highlights being the leading teen trio (Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo), Jim Brackus as Dean's father and Edward Platt as the Juvenile Officer. This was also the first film I'd seen from Nicolas Ray, who helms the film with a raw energy. The cinematography is immaculate. The film was originally to be filmed in Black and White, but once Dean became a star Warner Bros. changed to colour CinemaScope part-way through filming. Ray used this to great effect, creating striking compositions with the format. I'll have to give it a re-watch to be certain, but Rebel Without A Cause might become one of my favourite films. 10/10    Tootsie (1982) - Dir. Sydney Pollack:  Hilarious. It seems like another Mrs. Doubtfire, but it really is so much more. All of the performances are superb, and it maintains a large amount of wit and well-constructed comedy instead of resorting to slapstick. Pollack's direction builds up a great sense of panic as the film nears its uproarious yet touching climax. The entire cast is great, Bill Murray appears in much less overtly comedic role, but he's still fantastic. Much better than Mrs. Doubtfire, and one of the best comedies of the 80s.  9/10"
TrueFilm,3du0cj,bongo1138,7,Sun Jul 19 13:41:14 2015 UTC,Princess Kaguya is definitely not a family film. Kids could watch it I guess but i'm not sure they're get it or want to sit through all of it. 2014's Song of the Sea was a similar movie in many ways that parents can show their kids but even if you don't have any it's worth watching and contemplating.  At least that Hobbit movie was funny sometimes.

TrueFilm,3du0cj,Hahaieatpoop,3,Tue Jul 21 04:42:21 2015 UTC,"So this is the first contribution to one of these threads I've ever made and I'm not as astute a movie watcher as many here but I'll give it a shot...  I watched some pretty excellent movies recently that have been on my ""to watch"" list for a long time:  Seven Samurai Akira Kurosawa (1954): Absolutely fantastic! Long, but fantastic.  Obviously well made with some scenes that will really stick in my mind (like when everyone mourns Heihachi's death and Kikuchiyo grabs the samurai banner raising it over the village). I also liked its presentation of battle (and by extension, war) as something totally un-glorious challenging the usual depiction in classical heroic tales. Something I definitely think he did in Ran as well, though it's been a long time since I watched that one.   There Will Be Blood Paul Thomas Anderson (2007): Another really great movie. A very interesting exploration of power in America. I'll have to watch it again, probably a few times to really appreciate the commentary that I think is going on here.   The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly Sergio Leone (1966). Another one I just didn't feel right not having seen yet and once I read that this is Tarantino's favorite film I had to watch it. This was...basically a perfect movie. I loved it. I am woefully ignorant of western cinema but feel like I can totally get into it now especially after having seen so many japanese jidaigeki films which contributed a lot thematically and stylistically to westerns. In fact I'll be watching the Magnificent Seven tonight which I couldn't do in good conscious before seeing Seven Samurai. Also I could DEFINITELY see the influence this one's had on Tarantino.  I watched a few others as well. I've been working my way through really early movies, mostly romantic/screwball/musical comedies from the 30s and 40s. Just watched Gold Diggers of 1933 the other night and thought it was really good. I've also watched The Lady Eve, Trouble in Paradise, It Happened One Night, and *His Girl Friday**.  So that's what I've been watching."

TrueFilm,3du0cj,amnnn,3,Mon Jul 20 05:38:01 2015 UTC,"Persona (1966) Ingmar Bergman: 9/10 Obviously one of the most regarded film makers of this period, Bergman crafted something that I was not entirely prepared for to be completely honest. The beginning scenes with the cuts of different movie sequences and then the solemn boy in a white room trying to grasp these changing of women's faces had me intrigued from this moment on. Elisabet and Anna's interactions and dialogue were so engaging, there was something very real about Anna's stories and the shame she bore. I personally believe this is a movie that has a lot of subjective conclusions the viewers can draw from. For me the movie lingered for quite a few days and still is lingering in my thoughts about a person's role in life and what they go through just to fill other's expectations. It's not gonna be for everyone but as far as my brief entry into Criterion Collection films (which just started this week) this film has been my favorite so far of the few I've watched."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,lordhadri,7,Mon Jul 20 00:13:37 2015 UTC,"The Day the Earth Stood Still- (1951), Robert Wise,- This is a political commentary film as much as it is a science fiction film. An alien comes to Earth, seeing how it has recently developed atomic energy that could be used to travel to his own planet and other planets in the universe. Yet Earth is a dangerous planet, constantly involved in wars and there is great tension among countries. The message of the alien, and of the film, is this: Humans are violent people, and unless nations stop threatening war and destruction, there can be no peace. An appropriate message, especially considering the film was released during the Cold War era. It is a classic of science fiction, but to carp only a little, the ending is seem rushed and abrupt. But perhaps that was the intention of the film; to have the audience be left with this one final message. Also, very advanced special effects for the time period. 8.5/10  Deliverance (1972), John Boorman- I can’t remember the last time a film made me so uncomfortable. Deliverance does not feel like a wild ride down a river, it feels more like you are drifting calmly through the water in a canoe, at night, without a paddle, and you can hear the sounds of the wilderness closing in around you. It is the type of movie that makes you crawl out of your skin and go insane. Which is exactly what this film is about. Four city men go on a weekend canoe trip through rural Georgia, and expect to encounter the forces of nature, but are left victims to the forces of man. These three civilized men are then broken apart and turned to savages, not by the area around them, but by the people around them. It is about the degeneration of society as a whole.   Deliverance is a scream in the night that will haunt your thoughts for days after you viewed it. I’m not sure I particularly enjoyed this film, simply because it was so discomforting, but I can appreciate what it is about and what it does it does extremely well. 9/10  The Terminator (1984), James Cameron- James Cameron is the master of the popcorn flick. His films have all the essentials of a hot, buttery film that you watch twice in one night and once the next morning when you wake up on the couch. Cameron writes very poor dialogue, yet is able to make a few select lines that stand out from the rest of the film to become classics. His films lack substance, but are well made, and extremely entertaining. The worst scenes are the intimate moments of conversation between characters. In The Terminator I’m talking about the scene under the bridge and the scene in the motel, where it is just Sarah and Kyle alone together. Those scenes are hard to get through. But others when it’s just the Arnold reeking havoc on downtown Los Angeles? Amazing. Speaking of which, Arnold Schwarzenegger should have won an Oscar for his performance as the Terminator. He fits the role perfectly. There is no actor who could have portrayed the lifeless, deadly robot better than Arnie. 7/10  Infernal Affairs (2002), Andrew Lau, Alan Mak- This film begins by riding on two parallel lines. As it goes along both lines begin to slant. As the pace of this film rapidly increases, so does the slanting of the lines until they finally crash together to form a single line, and the audience doesn’t know if what they are seeing is one of the two lines from before that has just swallowed the other, or a completely different line all by itself. Infernal Affairs is a film of opposites. The police have a mole in a Hong Kong street gang, and the street gang has a mole in the police. The two spend the film trying to find each other out. When the film begins, there is clearly good and evil, yet when it ends, it is not made clear who are the heroes and who are the villains; who are the criminals and who are the victims. Infernal Affairs examines this theme while also providing an excellently directed and beautifully shot crime thriller. This is a film that will get your blood pumping and have you question your own morality. Great movie. I’ll go off topic for a bit, but I just want to discuss something real quick. As I’m sure most of you know, Martin Scorsese’s The Departed is a remake of this film. In my opinion they are both extremely well made films that do different things better than the other. The Departed’s strength is that it portrays the father/son relationships in the storyline much better, where in Infernal Affairs I didn’t feel like there were any strong connections. Infernal Affairs’ strength is that has a great, morally ambiguous ending while The Departed tries to tie everything together in a neat bundle for the viewer. I’d strongly recommend both of these films. If you haven’t seen either, watch The Departed first, simply because the elevator scene is better and needs to be seen fresh. 9/10  Ex Machina (2015), Alex Garland- This film is able to blur the lines between what is real and what is fake. What is human, and what is created by humans. The premise of the film is that the owner of a major technology company has created a robot with artificial intelligence, and sends one of his employees up to his house/research facility to  test if the robot he created is truly a machine, or a living thing. The setting is key to the theme of the plot. The film takes place in the verdant, mountainous wilderness of Norway, yet the research base is a modern, metallic gray outpost filled with the latest technology. This contrast between these two drastically different things plays towards the artificial v.s natural theme. The rest of the film is about deception. Who is playing who? Are the characters deceiving the robot? Is it deceiving them? Are they deceiving each other? It is a triangle of blurred reality. Then by the end of the film, you realize that you are the subject of the test. The film wants you to think about this: Do you think this computer is really human? A frightening question, seeing as the way modern technology is advancing, we could be dealing with A.Is in the near future. It takes a while to break the ice, but Ex Machina is a good film once it gets rolling. 7.5/10  Inside Out (2015), Pete Doctor- Pixar strikes again. This extremely creative film is about a little girl and the five emotions (Joy, Fear, Anger, Sadness and Disgust) that control her mind. It is simultainously a simple story about a girl who moves to a new town and feels lost, and an extravagantly great adventure about her emotions trying to deal with the situation. No pun intended when I say that Inside Out is a very emotional film. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you feel. What Pixar manages to do so well is create movies with emotion that inflict that emotion on the audience no matter what the age. Inside Out is a film that will shoot you into the stratosphere with it’s imaginative creativity and then bring you back down to Earth with it’s emotional reality. This is soul film at it’s finest.

TrueFilm,3du0cj,lordhadri,2,Sun Jul 19 20:53:20 2015 UTC,"Réalité from Quentin Dupieux. This man makes anti-films in the same sense as people are making anti-jokes. These are jokes that are not funny at all. You expect them to be funny because they begin with a classical scheme (a man walks into a bar.., knock knock...) but... they are not funny and pretty absurd. And that's what make them funny (if you like anti-jokes).    Quentin Dupieux makes anti-films. They feel like classical films but there is no consistency. And there is nothing to understand. No symbolism. If you think there is symbolism or another bullshit, look at Rubber, it's explained at the begining: there is nothing to understand, no reason. Just enjoy the films for what you want (the beauty, the characters, the music...) but not for the consistency of for the story."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,cattymills,2,Sun Jul 19 17:18:17 2015 UTC,"The Tribe Dir. Miroslav Slaboshpitsky -  What makes ‘The Tribe’ special is that the entire film is in sign language, with neither subtitles nor voiceovers to translate the dialogue. Instead, Slaboshpitsky employs the ‘show don’t tell’ mentality on a truly innovative plane. As a result, ‘The Tribe’ isolates the audience like nothing else – it throws you into this world where you can’t understand what anyone is saying and where you have no choice but to sit and tediously scrutinize each scene. You, like the boy in the wool sweater (played by Grigoriy Fesenko), are alone. That is until he and you are accepted into the tribe. And in the moments when Fesenko is walking and working alongside his peers, for as illegal as the crimes they’re committing the aforementioned loneliness the viewer feels, and relates, to the boy forces you to want to accept these terrible (and graphic) acts if it means you and Fesenko don’t have to be alone... However, it is extremely difficult to recommend this film to anyone who isn’t a cinephile. That isn’t meant demean casual viewers but ‘The Tribe’ is an unparalleled exercise in patience. More than one scene drags on for far too long, boasting a severe lack of significance to justify its length – coincidently making the film seem a lot longer than its already generous 130 minutes. Granted I did set through the film’s entirety, and found the ending to be darkly satisfying thematically, ‘The Tribe’ is much more concerned with engaging the viewer through its gritty authenticity, and thereby theme, than narrative. It’s an agenda that will surely off-put some from the start and test the endurance of its viewers whom, I guarantee regardless of focus, will be disengaged because of a few needlessly long scenes... Sure, I could say it’s a coming of age tale on steroids, but that would be a disservice to the piece of art this film is. It boldly transmits emotion like nothing I’ve ever seen – honestly making the viewer feel as though they’re a minority in this strange cruel world. 8.5/10 Full Review  Dope Dir. Rick Famuyiwa -  For all intents and purposes, ‘Dope’ is unforgivingly adamant on its target audience, leaving the CD buying generation in its wake – even 90s adults won’t get farther than Malcolm and Diggy’s wardrobe. This alienation spawns from 42-year old Famuyiwa’s adept understanding of contemporary teenage life, convincingly embedding various social media, acute racial differences and fluctuating score (curated by Pharrell). That’s not to say, ‘Dope,’ is incomprehensible to older audiences – much of my enjoyment, however, came from its idiosyncratic humor whilst maintaining authentic dialogue in addition to a likable and relatable main cast – likely a mutual positive considering resonation with the rising (and thriving) geek culture... Shameik Moore is in an entirely different league, though, for he brings a real confidence and swagger to Malcolm’s oddity. This juxtaposition isn’t as jarring as it insinuates thanks in large part to Moore’s ability to conquer sudden mood changes without much build up, allowing for a snappy pacing that matches Famuyiwa’s engaging yet unadorned non-linear narrative... Nevertheless, if Moore’s showing happens to be absent come January ‘Dope’s disappointing, hurried and frustratingly pompous conclusion is to blame, as it rips the heart of what made Malcolm and his off-beat trio so entertaining in the first place... the film’s message is jammed down the audiences’ throat whilst narrative and singularity (oh, did I forget to mention Malcolm had a love interest played by Zoe Kravitz? So did the movie) is thrown aside in favor of an unexpected sense of self-importance... I wouldn’t completely write off ‘Dope’ because of its ending. For as disappointing as it is, the film is still a ludicrous exploit into current geek culture helmed by a writer/director who understands and commits to his audience even if it alienates older viewers. Moore brings a surprising strength and range to a soon-to-be cult icon, seamlessly engaging himself alongside an equally humorous main cast to fully encapsulate even Highschool bullies. ‘Dope’ looses its soul in the end and over-states its self-worth, yet for at least two-thirds ‘Dope’ is in fact dope in every sense of the word. 7.0/10 Full Review  To Be or Not To Be Dir. Ernest Lubitsch -  Regardless of the controversially humorous script, Benny steals the show – although Stack would have given him a run for his money given more screen time, I guarantee. Yet, Benny is not only impressive visually, his bewildered face upon seeing Stack’s character leave during his on-stage soliloquy never tires after multiple uses – but his ability to fully embrace Ridges’ character whilst maintaining a hint of Joseph’s confident clumsiness is an absolute marvel in comedic acting... ‘To Be or Not To Be’ has already gone down in cinematic history as one of the greatest comedies, deservingly eclipsing WWII-era satires. Its genius use of dark humor allows us to unexpectedly reflect upon our own morality though comedy, as the 73-year differential fails to diminish neither the quantity nor quality of laughs much less astounding performance(s) by Benny. Stack does get a criminal lack of screen time, and it does take its sweet time returning to the jokes (not to demean Lombard’s adaptive showing) but much like ‘Lubinski,’ ‘Kurbinski,’ ‘Lominski,’ ‘Rozanski & Poznaski,’ lying in the ruble, you’ll find yourself pondering, “To laugh or not to laugh?” 8.5/10 Full Review"
TrueFilm,3du0cj,cubebreak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:35:05 2015 UTC,"While some individual shots of The Tribe are miserable to sit through (intentional, yes, but unnecessary) I personally didn't get all that antsy during it. I think it's because the setting and art direction are so great in it, you have plenty to look at most of the times the camera parks on something."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,cattymills,2,Mon Jul 20 01:51:26 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to study a few directors at a time lately, mainly Wes Anderson and Alfred Hitchcock. Excuse my concise summaries, I'm not very good at summing up my thoughts.  The Grand Budapest Hotel (Wes Anderson, 2014) - First off, I loved the production design. The bright colors and elaborate sets were gorgeous on screen. The movie was also absolutely absurd, but in an extremely charming way. The dialogue was the deadest of deadpan, a common Anderson trademark, but was also downright hilarious at times. The use of flat angles also contributed to the ""seriously not serious"" feel of the film. Other great aspects: the score, costuming, acting from the enormous cast. A+    North by Northwest (Alfred Hitchcock, 1959) - To be honest, I preferred Psycho and Vertigo (the two other Hitchcock films I've seen) over North by Northwest. However, those films are very hard to beat (Vertigo is one of my favorite films), and North by Northwest is still a very good film. It's more of an action-y, thriller type film instead of a mystery suspense, but it's still full of Hitchcock's trademarks: the icy blonde, a MacGuffin, deception, and sexuality. The film is less symbolic than Hitchcock's previous films (especially Vertigo), but is still visually stunning. A    Other films (ask me if you want elaborations on these!):  Love & Mercy (Bill Pohlad, 2015) - B+  Jurassic Park (Steven Spielberg, 1993) - B"
TrueFilm,3du0cj,yellow_sub66,2,Sun Jul 19 20:30:24 2015 UTC,"Rushmore Directed by Wes Anderson (1998)- Other than Martin Scorsese, Wes Anderson is my favorite filmmaker. The screenplay which is written by Owen Wilson and Anderson is flawless. It mixes so well with the direction and the cinematography. Schwartzman, Murray, and the rest of the cast are perfect for their roles. Along with all of Wes Anderson's other films, Rushmore has so much rewatchability.  The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou Directed by Wes Anderson (2004)- Not my favorite Wes Anderson film, but certainly not my least by any means. Bill Murray is perfect for the role of Zissou. The colors and the cinematography blend together beautifully which adds to Anderson's style of filmmaking. There are some inconsistencies with the structure of the film and in Owen Wilson's accent. But I still of course love the film.  The Wolf of Wall Street Directed by Martin Scorsese (2013)- Scorsese as stated before is my favorite filmmaker of all time. The screenplay is equal a comedy and a tragedy. Belfort has it all and throughout the film you can feel him losing everything. Di Caprio is phenomenal as Belfort. If you've read the book or any real footage of him you can tell Di Caprio really prepared for this role. Many have complained about the three-hour run time, but I find it to help greatly by showing his fast rise and steady decline while also showing his personal demons."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,TrumanB-12,2,Sun Jul 19 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"Hey, this is my first post in a What Have You Been Watching thread. I've really enjoyed the community in this sub for the past couple of months and love these threads in particular because I find so many great new films to watch. Please reply if you have recommendations or comments, I'd love to talk! :)  My Letterboxd account    Rope Alfred Hitchcock, 1948: I grew up watching a lot of Hitchcock because my Mom loved his films but I never really continued to watch him into my teen years. Getting more into film as a hobby recently, I've really wanted to take a more in-depth tour of Hitchcock's filmography. I have seen quite a few of his films but only have blurry memories of them and they kinda just fade into a haze if I try to think about a particular film.  I don't quite remember why I chose Rope. I think I didn't want to start with what's considered the best of Hitchcock so as to not compare everything to the pinnacle of his films, yet I still wanted a good first (second) impression on him. I think Rope fit the bill perfectly. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it'll be enough to bring me in for more Hitchcock.  A few thoughts on the film:   I didn't know about any of the camera work in it before viewing so it was really surprising to see these huge spans of the movie without a cut in the shot. Two things about this: the rather placid and gentle camerawork made these long takes not so fatiguing, especially because I feel like often long shots are too flamboyant (about the fact that it's a long take) and in one's face that it kind of takes one out of the movie to a degree - and this coming from someone who loves long takes. It certainly gave it an extra layer of suspense, and undoubtedly improves the film. It only got a little distracting when trying to keep up the illusion that the whole movie was one take - with the zooms to black surfaces.  I love the plot, and the characters were interesting. My biggest gripe was at the end of the film where I thought James Stewart's character had a stiff and kind of overtly preachy monologue. It wasn't awful, but it just felt out of place in a movie with a lot of subtlety. Not until reading about the movie afterward was I aware of any homosexual undertones between the two main characters. I don't really know what to make of that, but apparently that goes back to the story's origin as a play. The acting seemed swell (I'm really not one for commenting on acting, though) - I really liked Joan Chandler and am sad that she's not really in anything else.  Please recommend where I should go next in terms of Hitchcock. I was thinking Dial M for Murder or Strangers on a Train but I'm game for anything. 7.5/10    Little Miss Sunshine (rewatch) Jonathan Dayton, Valerie Faris, 2006: I love this movie. I feel like some people love to hate it because it kinda came out at a time where we were starting to get exhausted with the oversaturation of ""quirky"" comedies. And I totally get that, but to me, this one stands apart. I think the dysfunctional family here is unique and the characters feel quite free of cliches. Paul Dano and Steve Carell are so great in this and I love the way their characters interact. One thing I noticed this rewatch though is that some of the stuff Carell's character says about his homosexuality was really weird. Something about it seemed a bit off but I can't quite put my finger on it. Great movie nonetheless! 7/10    Chungking Express Wong Kar-Wai, 1994: Okay, I don't really expect to be able to put into coherent explanations how and what I felt when watching this movie. I had no real knowledge of the film going into it - which was so freeing - to put yourself in the hands of a capable director and to just be immersed in his work. It's certainly an experience and it totally enveloped me during my viewing. It's my first movie by Wong Kar-Wai and I now expect to fall in love with this director.  The film feels subterranean. I think you only see the sky or sunlight a handful of times. It's with this atmosphere that the movie conveyed a mood of melancholic nostalgia to me. It made me feel lonely and wistful, yet it warmed me. Now, I'm a sucker for nostalgia. But I feel the breed of nostalgia I suffer largely differs from the mainstream appreciation of all things retro (yes, what a special snowflake I am). The hazy nostalgia inflicted by a listen of an old album or a viewing of an old VHS tape of a school project made by my brother does a complex number on me. I can't really describe it - the only thing I can readily compare it to is the dreamy state where you're about to fall asleep. The half-awake vagueness of falling asleep while watching Alice in Wonderland (or your favorite childhood movie). I'm saying silly things but it's the way the film made me feel.  The movie is very poetic. The voice-overs for the guy in the first story were really well done - sentimental, maybe, but honest and innocent. And now that I think about it, it's interesting to see how the main male characters in the movie cope with lost love. The first cop creates systems and rituals to try and create order, such as eating all the cans of peaches that expire on May 1st. The second cop imposes characteristics and personalities that seem to mirror his own on everyday objects and stuffed animals in order to, I think, help him move past his break-up in a therapeutic way.   That's all I can really say about the film apart from anything more technical. It's beautifully shot. The scenes with what I guess is playing with the fps in the early part of the movie are so cool. They set the hazy/dreamy mood right away.   I loved the performances in the movie - they were a joy to watch. I saw somebody mention somewhere that you can't watch this movie and not fall in love with Faye Wong and I have to agree. Perhaps some would classify her as a manic dream pixie girl in this movie, but I think there's enough nuance to the character to set her apart.  Chungking Express has instantly shot up to be a part of my top 5 movies. 10/10    Time Lapse Bradley King, 2014: Well, I really didn't enjoy this movie much at all. It has a sort of clever time travel-ey plot to it that's admittedly intriguing. But, Jesus, the characters in this movie were awful. And I understand that an unlikeable character doesn't mean a bad character. I'm perfectly fine with unlikeable characters. So there was painter guy (his only characteristic), his girlfriend who wants more of his attention, and frat-guy who likes money. And boy, that last character was a gem. This was a sci-fi movie, but he was the most conventional horror movie asshole fodder that I've ever seen - ya know, the kind of character that the director obviously wants to make you hate and wish a horrible death. The constant ""Bro!"" and ""Dude!"" were exhausting.  I think the movie had some cool ideas about free will (yet never really went the direction I'd like with them) and a cool Twilight Zone feel to it, but I feel it ultimately collapsed under straight up silly writing and characters. 3/10"
TrueFilm,3du0cj,TrumanB-12,2,Mon Jul 20 18:20:20 2015 UTC,"My last fortnight. Little's really blown me away lately at all, apart from Leviathan  Northern Soul (2014) Decent British indie film about the phenomenon of 'Northern Soul', when kids from grim towns in Britain's north got into obscure American soul music in the late 60s and 70s and the culture that grew around it. The story is a bit pat and predictable, but the production design is terrific as is the soundtrack, as you might expect. Big hit in the UK.  Pasazerka (1963) An unfinished Polish film released by friends of director Andrezj Munk after his death. Surely one of the first features to be set in Auschwitz, and naturally powerful for its examination of a female guard and her relationship with one of the prisoners. Interesting piece  Mediterranee (1963) Another experimental film from the 1001 Movies list. Various images around the med repeated in different ways. Fairly tedious  Leviathan (2014) Powerful Russian film that was nominated for Best Foreign Picture. Brilliant performances and beautiful photography in this slow look at a man gradually grinded down to ruin in Job-like fashion by the Russian state. I thought it was terrific.   The Third Man (1949) Caught the 4K restoration of this classic on the big screen. Such a great movie, almost every element is perfect or close to. Noticed a few details I missed the first time I saw it, and seeing it in a packed theatre brought out the comedy in the first couple of reels a lot more.   The Gospel According To Matthew (1964) Pasolini's look at the life of Christ. Nice photography, interesting soundtrack mixing contemporary gospel tunes with classical pieces, shot almost silent movie style at times. Enjoyed it, though barely a week after watching, I find it's little stayed with me.   Targets (1968) Peter Bogdanovich's debut, made for Roger Corman and featuring Boris Karloff because he owed Corman a couple of days' work. Great little B movie about a nutjob mass shooter, with supporting story of Karloff (basically playing himself) worried about his place in the movie industry and modern society, the two plots colliding at a drive-in movie theatre. A fun piece, and you can see instantly that Bogdanovich was a talent.  Before the Revolution (1964) Was left rather cold by this Bertolucci film about a bourgeois youngster struggling with his ideas of socialist revolution etc. Oh, and shagging his aunt. I guess Bertolucci was highlighting the pretensions of the type, of which he himself was one. Fairly forgettable  Ant-Man (2015) Enjoyable enough, though I would have liked to see what Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish had done with it had they not been booted off. A simpler, smaller (pardon the pun) Marvel superhero movie, with some nice funny moments and scenes. Far from essential but certainly worth watching  Man of Steel (2013) Having bought into the Comic-Con hype about the Batman v Superman trailer, I decided to watch this, having had no interest when it was released. Dully plodding, with almost zero light moments. Like many, I found Snyder's shaky-cam and washed-out colour palette irritating to the point of distraction. Zimmer's score is forgettable. And the city-levelling finale is almost comical, though I suppose they seem set to address that in the sequel, whether by design or as a reaction to the criticisms is another matter. Can't say it got me excited for number two  Black God, White Devil (1964) Another tale of poverty and religion from the Brazilian Cinema Novo. Splits into equal halves, peasant Manoel first following a black man he believes to be St Sebastian, then a white murderous bandit. Neither are great models. Maybe it was because the quality of copy I was watching was poor, but I found the often hand-held photography hard to watch, much like Man of Steel 50 years later. Some real bonkers, surreal scenes and imagery - I wanted to like it, but wasn't grabbed at all; maybe have to see a proper restored version.  Broadcast News (1987) A more interesting-than-average romantic comedy set in a newsroom in the 80s. I failed to appreciate it as much as most critics seem to, however. Awful soundtrack from Bill Conti, the guy who did Rocky. Holly Hunter - the ur-Liz Lemon as I saw a commenter on the Criterion site call her - is fairly annoying, though William Hurt and Albert Brooks as the two other points in the love triangle are good. Nice to have an intelligent script"
TrueFilm,3du0cj,usabfb,6,Tue Jul 21 04:34:25 2015 UTC,"The Tales of Hoffmann directed by Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger (1951) ★★★★  I’d never even heard about this movie until a couple of weeks ago when it was one of the only movies featured in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl that I was not familiar with at all. I wish I had been familiar with it before, and I feel like I really should have been, because this is a movie that more people should generally be aware of. It’s one of the only times I’ve seen opera represented in cinema, and it could not have been done better. Not only is it entertaining and fun to listen to, The Tales of Hoffmann is straight up one the most beautifully crafted films I’ve ever seen. The production design and costume design are fantastic, with so much care put into every little detail. The Tales of Hoffmann is more about creating a wonderfully fantastic world rather than music. In this opera, music comes second to visual artistry which is what really makes this an ambitious and breathtaking movie. The scale of the sets, the vibrant colors of the world we’re drawn into, the creative costumes all make this movie something insanely special.  rewatch - Monty Python’s Life of Brian directed by Terry Jones (1979) ★★★1/2  Life of Brian is a very funny movie. Plain and simple. The jokes are hilarious, the actors have amazing timing, the concept is outlandish and so entertaining. I also think Life of Brian is just a well made movie. It’s a spot on parody of the bible epics of the 50s. Even the poster makes fun of Ben-Hur and you can see a lot of that in Terry Jones’ direction. That said, even though I think that the filmmaking has grown up a lot between Holy Grail and this, I also just find that Life of Brian is so much more disjointed. It’s the Modern Times to Holy Grail’s City Lights. Meaning I think that it is a very good movie, I think in some ways it’s even more funny than the earlier films, and is certainly more innovative. That said, it’s more disjointed and doesn’t connect with me on the same level that Holy Grail has always connected with me.  The Exorcist directed by William Friedkin (1973) ★★★★  Even though it didn’t really scare me at all, this was probably one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. The atmosphere and build up was amazing, instead of having to bombard us with scares from the beginning of the film, The Exorcist makes us wait for a scare. It has restraint, which makes it so creepy. I’m not used to horror movies having restraint, this seems to be one of the only things modern horror did not take from this movie. Another thing that makes this movie timeless even when the scares are outdated is the focus on filmmaking technique and not just cheap scares. The Exorcist is a great movie by any standard. It may not be the scariest movie anymore, but it stands up because of the amount of care put into every other aspect.  The Battle of Algiers directed by Gillo Pontecorvo (1966) ★★★★  The Battle of Algiers is one stylish movie, it’s this cool mix of new wave French (you can see that a lot of it is very Godard influenced), Italian neorealism, and American war epic. These three things all coming together to make a very stylized take on the Algerian revolution. But it never lets the style get in the way of the substance. It was educational, and like most of the best war films, it shows both sides as corrupt instead of portraying one group as more in the right. It shows us that France was extremely wrong and tyrannical over Algeria, but also shows that the ways that the FLN revolted were unethical and destructive. The Battle of Algiers is a really great movie.  rewatch - Avatar directed by James Cameron (2009) ★★★★  I’ve heard it all. Heard every complaint against Avatar but nothing can change my mind, this is a great movie. I’ve seen it tons of times since 2009, but this is the first time since theaters that I saw it in 3D, and I maintain my position that this is the best use of 3D ever. Even though I enjoy films like Gravity and Hugo slightly more as films, what Cameron does with the 3D here is incredible. He takes into consideration that colors become dimmed down through 3D glasses, and makes every color all the more vibrant to compensate for it. The world he creates is so bright and colorful that even through 3D glasses, it looks more colorful than most other movies. You look at another 3D movie, like Avengers: Age of Ultron for example, and you’ll just see how well Cameron uses color to make 3D enjoyable. Avatar is a visual marvel, and a fun story that stands up with my favorite fantasy movies as a great hero’s journey storyline. It is also the benchmark for world building in movies.  Film of the Week - The Tales of Hoffmann"
TrueFilm,3du0cj,usabfb,4,Sun Jul 19 13:53:03 2015 UTC,"I saw Avatar opening week (with a surprisingly small to medium audience size) in 3D and it was absolutely incredible. I LOVED it, and its use really drew you into the world to the point that throughout the whole movie, there was never a dull moment because visually you were always appealed. I've watched it after in high definition without 3D and it's not the same.  Although I think Gravity has been the closest movie to capture the 3D overwhelming visual appeal; however, the trouble there is the lack of vibrancy in colors in space."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,QuickManIsUnbeatable,5,Mon Jul 20 02:26:14 2015 UTC,"I too saw Avatar for the first time on the first day it was out. No one was in the theater, it was very empty. May have been because it was a 1:00 showing on a Friday and my friends and I had skipped school to see it. But it blew me away.   I would say in terms of depth and use of levels in 3D, Gravity is the next best thing. If we're talking colors as well as depth and creative use of the medium, then it's Hugo. These three movies make the holy trifecta of 3D though."
TrueFilm,3du0cj,esau1,3,Mon Jul 20 02:30:35 2015 UTC,"Sounds like that's to be expected for Friday at 1! But what's interesting about Avatar's run is it started off pretty average, but I think word-of-mouth helped it in the middle of its box office run. In contrast, I went on a Saturday night.   I haven't seen Hugo in 3D nor have I seen its end. It's frustrating to not be able to see these movies in 3D unless you have a nice TV setup for it. I would really love to re-experience Avatar in 3D, and hopefully Cameron or the distributor of Avatar will offer that chance when Avatar 2 is released."

The highest grossing movie of all time getting a re-release? That couldn't ever possibly happen. :P"
TrueFilm,3du0cj,RetroGmr,4,Mon Jul 20 05:36:52 2015 UTC,"Anatomy of a Murder (1959) directed by Otto Preminger  I kind of wish just wrote about this when I saw it, because now I don't really know what to say. It's very well directed, well performed (especially by James Stewart, George C. Scott, and Ben Gazzara), and gets through its long runtime swimmingly. But, the ambiguity, despite the best efforts of Gazzara, if I recall correctly, feels a little tacked on—like a weak attempt at giving this another dimension.  ★★★1/2  Anna Karenina (1935) directed by Clarence Brown  With the benefit of years of critical discussion to single out all the multitudinous classic of Classical Hollywood, studio filmmaking I often find myself forgetting that the era (I think) was pretty reviled as it happened, and Anna Karenina serves as a perfect example of why that was. It's super generic. All those rules of Classical Hollywood style and direction -- medium establishing shots followed by crosscutting, never transgressing the 180 degree axis, clear lighting, etc. -- are painfully followed to an inexpressive tee. Each scene exists only to push the story forward in a heavy handed, superficial way. The dialogue has zero character. If it wasn't for the fame of Greta Garbo, this could be a completely anonymous work. It's not completely worthless -- the story of Anna Karenina, as chained down as it is in the film, is clearly a great one; the opulent glamour of the richest is alluring; and you can see at times what made Garbo so famous. But, when your 90 minute film is dragging, something's gone wrong.  ★★  Babel (2006) directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu  Babel was definitely the kind of film that had to win me over (due to mostly superficial reasons). Naming a film Babel and it having the kind of conceit it does is inherently presumptuous, and what I've heard of Iñárritu regarding Birdman only added to that. And you know what, Babel is definitely pretentious. The presentation of it is of the present day ""THIS IS AN ART MOVIE"" kind, it doesn't say anything in comparison to its lofty title and narrative, and on top of that it manages to bring up all these present day issues without really saying anything about them.   But, what can I say—Babel nevertheless won me over. Some dumb plot contrivances aside, the narrative is handled really well; it manages to deftly, clearly navigate the unwieldy amount of individual stories by playing around with the chronological order for simple ease and sometimes emotional effect and it's really well paced—I was fairly enthralled for almost two-and-a-half hours. Not a lot of movies can do that. Babel really gets you into the emotional state of its characters, and there are a lot of varied emotions—from heartwarming to heart-wrenching—many intense. And, while the subtext may not be present at a richly rewarding level, there is something said, without being naive or cynical, about communication and empathy to get over our seemingly ingrained hostility towards one another. I can get behind that.  ★★★1/2  Three Colors: Blue (1993) directed by Krzysztof Kieślowski  I know comparisons are the devil and all, but in some ways Three Colors: Blue reminded me of The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover: both are slow paced, capture beautiful environments in a way that makes them even more beautiful, have lush orchestral scores, feature steady and economic direction, weld contrived (and I don't mean that pejoratively, here) formalism onto a plotless narrative; and are undertaken with the utmost gravity. They're both skillfully made at each individual level in an overall cohesive style that certainly held my attention -- sometimes more -- throughout. And because it isn't tasteless, is shorter by a half hour (not bending its glacial pace to the breaking), and actually successfully accomplishes its narrative goal Blue is undoubtedly better than The Cook.... But, I still can't help but feel that this solemn style is destined to just stamp out every last vestige of emotion in whatever film its found in -- Blue isn't an exception to this. While the film definitely wants a lack of emotion for a bit, it quickly starts building towards an emotional catharsis that it just couldn't achieve for me -- meaning that the narrative climax is cerebral, when it really ought to be emotional.  ★★★1/2  Captain Phillips (2013) directed by Paul Greengrass   Captain Phillips is a fine film -- just fine, though. It's taut, but nowhere near as atmospheric as it could be considering the terrifying, hostile expanse of the ocean, piracy, and hostage situations. It pays lip service to the circumstances that drove the Somali fishermen into piracy, but it doesn't expound in any way on the hilariously unfair and disparate (from the Americans) conditions and its heart and attention remains firmly on the Americans. Tom Hanks does give a great, memorable performance, but he's also given so much more to work with than his counterpart in Barkhad Adbi. And so on. I feel like the ending is a great microcosm of Captain Phillips; it's great that the killing of three humans isn't treated as a rousing victory and that the film doesn't ignore the emotional trauma of it, but you wish that it could express the tragedy through the cruel hand the Somalis have been dealt and actual characterizations of them rather than solely through a white American screaming.  ★★★  Blue Jasmine (2013) directed by Woody Allen  For the first hour or so, it feels like Blue Jasmine is essentially assuring rich people that it's okay to be rich. Yeah, Jasmine is a bit haughty and wealth ignorant, but at least she's witty and has taste unlike those—ugh—poor people (who, by the way, aren't even poor) who are ugly, tasteless, anti-intellectual, possessive, etc. And yeah, there are shitty rich people—Hal (Alec Baldwin)—but, don't worry, there are plenty of good ones as well—Dwight (Peter Sarsgaard) and Al (Louis CK). By the end of the hour this train of events had pretty much eroded all the good will Allen's skill had created.  But then, the film changes direction rather abruptly. Unfortunately, I'm not so sure said direction it goes in is significantly better. The change is jarring—it's just rushed into—and itself is problematic. It turns into an exposé on Jasmine's enormous personal failings. This isn't inherently a bad thing and is well done, but in doing this it pretty completely abandons the class issues involving her.  At least Blue Jasmine doesn't completely abandon the ""class stuff,"" choosing to resolve it through Jasmine's sister. But, the problem with this is that Jasmine is so clearly the main character and because of Cate Blanchett so magnetic that electing to take her storyline—and by her stature thus the film's storyline—in a less interesting direction feels criminally irresponsible. And, it leaves all these things unresolved. The middle-class characters Jasmine despises and the downright offensive portrayal of them is left up in the air. It could just be how Jasmine views them, but because the—once again—""class stuff"" isn't resolved through her that solution is, at best, inconclusive.  Look, it's a Woody Allen film, so it's going to be well-written, well shot, well directed, well musically curated, well performed, and on. And Cate Blanchett is fantastic. Of course it's watchable. But, I can't help but Blue Jasmine is uneven enough to erode a good portion of that.  ★★1/2"

TrueFilm,3dtcfg,respighi,24,Sun Jul 19 06:51:30 2015 UTC,"I see this scene as a tribute to the movies, a nostalgia. Of course the scene is a tonal shift from the rest of the film. It's saccharine and decadent. Yes, it's sentimental. But I don't think it's being sentimental only about the characters. We are watching them watch something else—the scene is about the fountain show as much as anything. The film's last image is of the Bellagio, the fountains, and the balustrade, and none of the characters. There are people walking past in the foreground that pay no attention to the fountain.  There's a tribute here to an older sense of entertainment: the Debussy, the orchestra, the Bellagio, the fountain show. The last character to leave is Saul, the oldest. Maybe we're being asked to remember the original film. But if this scene is just a fourth wall nod from remake to original, it's done here with much more fondness than say 21 Jump Street or Jurassic World.  I like to think of this scene as the end credits sequence of a movie, or as a painting in a museum, a place where people walk out at their own leisure. Watch the scene here. Watch the profile shots starting at 0:50 which allow Brad Pitt's character to be framed with the other characters, and watch Pitt's facial gestures from there until where he leaves at 1:09. He's practically rolling his eyes at the fountain show. It's like you can here him saying to Saul on his right at 0:51, ""You really like watching this shit?"", and then to the guys on his left at 0:58, ""Can you guys believe we're watching this shit?"", and then he rolls his eyes at the fountain for a little while, and then again to Saul at 1:08, ""Okay buddy, have fun with that."" His is the characterization of irony and the new generation. Saul's is the opposite. When the last of the others leave at 1:27, they look at Saul, and then he is left to appreciate the fountain himself. We get one last close-up cut at 1:38 before he leaves but shot from the other side of him, as if to show the change of thought that brings him to abandon the fountain as the others. No one is there to see the grand finale at 1:51. No one except us.  Edit: Just watched the film again myself. The Bellagio is totally not the last image of the film—I was wrong. Damn epilogue."

TrueFilm,3dtcfg,Thisisnow1984,6,Sun Jul 19 07:51:31 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. It's beautiful, Claire de lune a perfect choice for score. We as the audience have just witnessed a great heist film and this is the quiet reflection of all the characters going back to the begining where they came from. They will all disperse quietly into the ether after watching the rhythmic pulses of the timed water."
TrueFilm,3dtcfg,hydra815,16,Sun Jul 19 17:42:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think OP is questioning what the scene means to the characters but is more interested in why the film is portraying them in such a positive, angelic light when, in reality, they are all career criminals. He mentions about the tonal inconsistency of that scene and I tend to agree with him. I always thought it was a rather poignant scene but it also goes against Soderbergh's moral aloofness throughout the rest of the film."
TrueFilm,3dtcfg,WhyAmIMrPink-,44,Sun Jul 19 08:57:24 2015 UTC,"How is it a tonal inconsistency, when the entire movie portrayed those criminals as cool guys. I don't think the movie ever makes you doubt about them, sure they're criminals but they're the protagonists, the good guys in the perspective of the movie. Terry Benedict might be the 'legitimate businessman', but he's constantly portrayed as the villain. Hell, the movie even makes it a point to show that he's a bad guy, he fucked over Reuben and took Ocean's girl (who is won back from the 'bad guy' in the end). The characters' main motivation is still the money and they're just criminals and use Reuben's grudge against Benedict to their adventage (unlike in Ocean's Thirteen where they actually mess with a casino without going for the money, they want revenge). But the movie really wants to communicate to the viewer that ""Ocean's Eleven"" are the ones to root for. So I don't see how the scene is tonally inconsistent.   The way you're seeing the tonal inconsistency makes me think about a mafia movie or The Wolf of Wall Street, where we're following characters that are obviously bad guys and while we're going along with them and indulging in that life, we're never forgetting that they're criminals and bad people. Michael Corleone's victory in The Godfather doesn't have a light tone like Ocean's Eleven, The Wolf of Wall Street makes the point in the end of showing how the good guys don't always win (I'm staying a bit vague here to avoid spoilers for these movies, but it should be clear enough for those that have watched them). I never felt Ocean's Eleven ever going that way."
TrueFilm,3dtcfg,hughk,2,Sun Jul 19 11:52:39 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of a fine line, but not really that fine. We're on the side of Ocean and his crew throughout. They're the heroes/antiheroes. We're rooting for them to pull off the heist, and to screw over the douchey casino owner. Fine, I'm on board. However, there's a detachment or tongue-in-cheekness through almost the whole movie. The usual social contract with movies about career criminals is in full effect: we're vicariously going to enjoy watching their devious ways, but as a kind of guilty pleasure or wish fulfillment fantasy, as an indulgence into our ""dark side"". Given that this tone dominates through most of the movie, the uber-sincere and sympathetic fountain scene is a shift that seems to come out of nowhere."
TrueFilm,3dtcfg,hydra815,5,Tue Jul 21 05:57:38 2015 UTC,"Are they portrayed as angels, well not really. However they do work together and trust each other. so there is an internal morality. Are we being told they are angels, no, just a very good team, albeit on the wrong side of the law. However, against whom? Casinos are hardly angels either but is anyone asking us to judge?"
TrueFilm,3dtcfg,hughk,2,Sun Jul 19 11:57:45 2015 UTC,"Very good point. I think we are meant to respect the typical trope that, despite the fact that what they are doing is highly illegal, immoral and dangerous, they work together as a team, have their own individual skill sets and tell better jokes than the bad guys. But when you look a little deeper into the film, I think questioning the motives and ideals of the characters and figuring out just how well Soderbergh managed to get us to sympathise/empathise with them can reap rewards."
TrueFilm,3dtcfg,strangenchanted,4,Sun Jul 19 12:45:02 2015 UTC,"Any work of fiction has the possibility to take us to other worlds. Sometimes, explicitly in the case of fantasy or science fiction but often implicitly where the rules change. We have been taken into the seductive world of the ""long-con"" which became famous with ""The Sting"". The rule is to stay true to your crew. They all bring skills, and the important thing is for everyone to work together. What is also important is the use of fake betrayal to give the audience pause for thought.   The other point is the selection of a victim. The audience may have some sympathy which may prevent them falling into the world. A real con may go after ordinary people with fake investments (i.e., the Boiler Room is pretty realistic). In Oceans 11, the target, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) is a casino boss. Well he may be legal, but he is making money out of people by using their weaknesses, a kind of confidence trick. Most people would consider such a person to be in a way a valid target, even if they make money legitimately.  And yes, while Benedict is show to be frankly, a ruthless rich asshole, even if he does have a weakness for Tess, Danny's team is built up more sympathetically."

TrueFilm,3dtcfg,j-throw,4,Sun Jul 19 12:41:44 2015 UTC,"Its been a while since I've seen Oceans, but my take away was that it's all about being a man.   Danny doesn't do it for the money. He does it to prove he's the bigger man. To win over the woman.  Reuben says ""He torpedoed my casino, muscled me out. Now he's gonna blow it up next month to make way for some gaudy monstrosity"" (torpedo = penis, muscle = man, gaudy monstrosity = big penis). Even the imagery of Reuben's building collapsing is phallic, showing the destruction of his manliness.   With a correlation between buildings and manliness, Danny and his team stealing from Benedict's buildings is a direct nab at his manliness.  Saul at one point says ""Tess is with Benedict now? She's too tall for him."" This feeds into his character as someone who feels the need to compensate.  When Benedict finds out he was robbed he also tells Tess to leave. ""Perhaps it would be better if you weren't around for this.""  The twins are always competing for manliness. When we meet them, one beats the other because his monster truck is bigger. When the one who loses loses, he closes the antenna to his remote control, showing how he lost his manliness via phallic imagery . One even insults the other by saying ""waiting, sweetheart"" and ""you're like a little girl.""  Part of the heist takes place during a boxing match where two men fight to prove THEIR manliness.  Even the remote switch for the big bomb that destroys the protective wall (vault) to Benedict's manliness doesn't work at first. Sort of an erectile disfunction nod.  Even the vault resembles a penis.  So to me, the fountains are consistent with this imagery. In fact, I'd say it's the literal climax of this manliness imagery as we see each of their dreams of manliness come true."
TrueFilm,3dtcfg,Mojohito,2,Sun Jul 19 22:10:45 2015 UTC,"Sure. But I don't see how any of that relates to the tone of the fountain scene. It's an unmanly scene. It comes off like a sincere, affectionate tribute to the crew, by the filmmaker. I'm not sure why fountains would represent the climax of manliness, but even if they do, the scene could've been shot in any number of different ways. The stirring ""Clair de Lune"" didn't have to be there. etc."
TrueFilm,3dtcfg,Bladewing10,2,Mon Jul 20 02:30:54 2015 UTC,"To me, the manliness themes in the film are meant to highlight their ridiculousness. How absurd it is to waste your energy focusing on trying to be the bigger man. The fountain scene, for me, reflects that ridiculousness. I feel we are meant to take a step back in that moment and realize how ridiculous the pursuit of manliness is. It's a never ending, pointless pursuit that only gets people hurt and in trouble (the end with the chase car shows this one last time).  And by climax, I meant literal sexual climax. The massive jets of water represents ejaculate and sexual success (being a man)."

TrueFilm,3dwvs3,WildlifeAnalysis,4,Mon Jul 20 05:09:38 2015 UTC,"The message is that sometimes people get prescriptions that they don't really need, and those prescriptions can damage people's lives significantly.    Its been a while since I saw that film, but that really wasn't the message I thought they were trying to convey. By my reading, it wasn't that the medication aggravated the situation, only that it failed to stem the tide.   The protagonist had positioned sleep as her main obstacle to loving her son, but when sleep medication failed to resolve the situation, the underlying reality came to light: sleep was not to blame for the way she felt.  For me, the focus was more on the unexpected and unwanted feelings one could have as a parent towards your own child, and how we relate to intrusive thoughts that bubble up during periods of stress. There was also, if I remember correctly, a lot said about grief, though the details of that are hazy at this distance.  Regarding your edit:   Requiem for a Dream   As far as I am concerned, the whole purpose of that film is to make sure that the viewer understands, comprehensively, that heroin and (meth?)-amphetamine addiction is a bad thing. As though the audience had to be strenuously persuaded. I agree that it completely fails to contextualise amphetamine prescription, but the film is so committed to avoiding nuance or subtlety that I am entirely unsurprised that it throws context under the bus.  In general, media lack both accurate and positive portrayals of people with mental health issues, and a side effect of that is that daily coping, as is successfully achieved by most people who live with these conditions, both on and off medication, is rarely seen.   Many films and television shows that do discuss mental health either find little new to say (Still Alice) or fetishize the condition (A Beautiful Mind). There are a few exceptions: Little Miss Sunshine handles depression quite well, Synecdoche: New York is an exceptional rendering of anxiety and the first season of the show Homeland featured a protagonist with bipolar disorder who benefited considerably from her medication."
TrueFilm,3dwvs3,Double-Down,2,Mon Jul 20 09:27:42 2015 UTC,I would slightly change your characterization from overcoming mental illness through willpower to overcoming by confronting your emotional history. These are just old Freudian ideas. Mix it up with traditional horror techniques and there's your movie. I didn't find it that interesting as the film gave up its raison d'etre pretty easily.
TrueFilm,3dwvs3,Thexorretor,2,Mon Jul 20 10:32:59 2015 UTC,You don't know what you are talking about.  1- Every work of fiction conforming to your ideas about medication and mental illness would be hadly ideal ( which you are clearly implying any depiction of the said concepts that does not conform to your opinions are worth criticising and correcting)  2- A interpretation you hold about a film is neither the interpretation or the only interpretation. E.g. The Babadook can easily be understood as being about the overwhelming responsibilties of raising a young child by oneself or a mother's trial with grief.
TrueFilm,3dwvs3,TheSoundOfHerWings,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:42:12 2015 UTC,"Medications for psychological disorders can have profoundly positive effects in people's lives, yet films like The Babadook decide to ignore these positive effects, focusing only on the negatives...   I hear where you are coming from, but I think your focus is not the same as the film's. You may be magnifying the issue of medication in the film in a way that other audience members did not. I didn't see The Babadook's inclusion of medication as a statement of any kind, but rather an indication that Amelia wasn't ready to emotionally confront her past trauma.  I wanted to point you to another movie you might find interesting which deals very directly with the choice to treat depression through medication, and how difficult that choice can be for some people to make. The characters in Mania Days suffer from bipolar disorder, and struggle to balance the known benefits of medication with their perceived drawbacks. The writer/director, Paul Dalio, is also bipolar, and brings a lot of compassion and perspective to his film. He has said specifically that he made Mania Days to reach out to people who avoid seeking medical treatment for their conditions, and encourage them to work through the challenges medication can bring.  Dalio's characters are clearly experiencing a chemical condition. Even though they know that to be true, it still takes determination, and strong force of will to choose to stay on medication. In The Babadook, Amelia's condition isn't chemical, but she still must have that same force of will to confront it's root cause. Despite their different outcomes, Dalio's and Kent's characters are making the same choices, for many of the same reasons."
TrueFilm,3dtqci,Raichu93,9,Sun Jul 19 11:01:29 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of the original film because of it's sprawling story and top notch acting from Ricardo Darín, both of which can be replicated in an American remake to varying degrees of success, but many of the finer points of the original were based around the Argentinian locations, South American fire and cultural signposts scattered throughout. The soccer stadium scene, the conversations about being unable to ignore your passion and the oranges and greens that gave the film this signature warmth seem to have been lost on the new one.   It doesn't make me angry or anything but remaking this one seems to reek massively of a cash-in/lack of an original idea."

How is that possible? I just figured Argentina was a terrible country that no one would want to live in if the laws were so mediocre and non functioning - that would at least explain this plot. I have not seen a movie like that before were the bad guys can just do what they want without any repercussions. And then it was set to take place in the past - the solution? Just film 90% of the movie inside that way you don't have to show old cars or houses that are hard to find. Terribly lazy filmmaking. So I am actually looking forward to a remake. Maybe they will solve the problems with the story and make it into an exiting watch.
TrueFilm,3dtqci,aureliano_babilonia,6,Sun Jul 19 15:57:18 2015 UTC,"During the time frame of the movie there was a coup d'etat in Argentina, after which a far right military dictatorship was installed. Thousands of people, especially left wing militants and university students were clandestinely murdered and disappeared during this time, and many people who sided with the government gained a lot of power and immunity. This is what was happening after the dude got incarcerated, but it's not really explained in the film as they expect you to know these things as part of latin american history and culture. I hope this helps you understand the tone and events of that part of the film (I'm assuming you did not know this beforehand, if you did and still don't think the events are justified then we simply have differing opinions, I thought the film was brilliant)."
TrueFilm,3dtqci,JurijFedorov,0,Sun Jul 19 17:00:31 2015 UTC,It only follows these very rich and powerful people and then suddenly they are experiencing bad things out of nowhere that are created by this guy that is invincible. It just seems very weird. They don't really explain why he is so extremely powerful - but he probably works for the state as a killer then. Still that is a bigger story then than the smaller story the movie tells. But still it is 100% ignored. Very weird. It's telling a story in a country and not explaining why something really weird happens that would never happen in any other country with similar living standards.  I really don't care if other people like it while I am not a huge fan. But again I see people downvoting my opinion on a movie. And it is not because I am negative because I have been heavily downvoted for stating that I like action movies. Why are action movies not true films?
TrueFilm,3dtqci,JurijFedorov,3,Sun Jul 19 17:32:20 2015 UTC,"Why are action movies not true films?   They can be true films. But based on your comments here, which have some wacky logic to their criticisms, I highly doubt its that opinion that gets you downvoted, more like your unreasonable comments.   It only follows these very rich and powerful people   None of the main characters are the rich and powerful, they are fighting the rich and powerful. Yeah, it's so crazy that a criminal goes free after committing crimes right? That never happened many times right here in the US.   Like how was the bad guy getting away with it or the bad guys? How is that possible?   Ever heard of Carla Homolka? What she did was 10 times worse than the villain in this film, yet struck a deal to walk free JUST LIKE THE VILLAIN. So don't give me that ""how is that possible"" shit, movies to begin with are about rare events, that's what makes them worth watching instead of someone's everyday occurrence.   Just film 90% of the movie inside that way you don't have to show old cars or houses that are hard to find. Terribly lazy filmmaking   ???  Shit like this is why you're getting downvoted. Criticisms that read as if you watched a completely different film. I would not call a carefully crafted 5 minute long take to be ""lazy filmmaking"", Mr. armchair filmmaker."
TrueFilm,3dtqci,JurijFedorov,0,Sun Jul 19 19:30:26 2015 UTC,"No need for ad hominem.  What I mean with lazy filmmaking is the same thing we see in the new Sherlock Holmes or Illusionist with Edward Norton. They film a few scenes outside but it all seems fake as the never more about freely outside and have a lot of takes that are made to not recreate the old environment. Cheap filmmaking. It is warranted critique as that's just how this movie is made.  And with rich and powerful I mean their wealth and positions. They are not just regular people. For Argentina they would be considered the top 5% at least at that time. So yes, they are rich and have power. If they followed orders they would have been left alone. While many other people did not have that choice. So they seem - lucky. Someone who could have avoided it all if they really wanted to and didn't use tricks to imprison the killer. If they didn't trick him he would not have been an enemy to them. Which kinda takes a bit of the fear out of the movie."
TrueFilm,3dsy58,TheOneWhoKnocks97,9,Sun Jul 19 03:50:20 2015 UTC,"Well, this sort of theory comes up with a lot of films, and it's very difficult to disprove. However, I think it's just that in entering the second act the protagonist crosses a threshold, and in a lot of cases this can allegorically be interpreted as a a death - and in a way it is - the death of the old way of life for the protagonist and his or her entry into the otherworld. For most stories this translates into entering a place or state of risk. In the story of Inanna or Orpheus, this translates into a literal journey into the underworld.   But usually not literally. Only in the case of 'Jacob's Ladder'. And maybe 'The Sixth Sense' though I can't recall when in the story Bruce Willis was shot.  I think you're right on the money with the 'flight symbolising fame' theory though. Think of the final scene. His daughter, representing the younger generation of film-goers (""Always dare, never truth"") looks and sees him fly, she believes at long last."
TrueFilm,3dsy58,CugeltheClever,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:20:41 2015 UTC,"I try not to decide for sure exactly what I think the ending ""means"" since there's so much interpretation involved with film, but I completely agree with all of this as well. Well said. I personally believe that Riggan survived, but I've just been wondering about the significance of those cuts for a long time."
TrueFilm,3dsy58,JayRosco510,2,Sun Jul 19 19:31:24 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting thought. I think the dead jellyfish say a lot about Riggan's life. Riggan said it was the jellyfish that shocked him and saved him from drowning. After Riggan shoots himself in the head we see dead jellyfish washed up on the beach. The jellyfish symbolize Riggan's life, but they are dead now so Riggan is dead. This is where I thought Riggan truly died during my first watch through, but on the second I took more note of a shot in the opening credits. Interestingly, there is a subliminal message-type shot in the very beginning of the film of the dead jellyfish, so is he dead during the whole duration of the film? The jellyfish symbolism definitely make your theory a good possibility."
TrueFilm,3dsy58,BabyFratelli,0,Sun Jul 19 22:07:57 2015 UTC,"My interpretation of the jellyfish wasn't so much that they're his life, but they're his will to live. He keeps fumbling through his creative life, and external forces keep jolting him awake and prompting him to keep going (his daughter, his ex, the play, etc). He begins to lose these things throughout the film. I think that when he shot himself on stage, he had finally given up, represented by the jellyfish being dead, and as a final kick in the gut he failed at even that suicide attempt - this is because he will never have the kind of success he desires, only in ways that are meaningless to him.  This breaks him so completely that even when he realises he has achieved critical success and his relationship is repaired with his daughter, it doesn't matter, and his lack of ability to feel fulfilled and happy in any state of being drives him to his true death (Also implying that he was misguided in his belief that having a successful play would make him fulfilled creatively, etc), at the end of the film, when he jumps out the window."

TrueFilm,3drcjj,CoreyBrewersGoat,23,Sat Jul 18 18:39:10 2015 UTC,"Does pointing a camera at something not convey an objective truth?   No. If anything it has a chance to distort it so filmmakers like Herzog are just more upfront about it. People won't act the same way alone the same way they will with cameras around (for the most part) so already ""reality"" is a little skewed. Even if people don't notice it they may perform, they may over-react, and so on. Then on top of that there's editing. What a documentarian leaves in or leaves out skews the ""reality"" or truth of the piece. Maybe we'd be more sympathetic to a subject seeing a shot where he cried, if left out he's a heartless man. So editing too shapes reality to fit whatever the film is doing or saying.   So in a lot of cases documentaries are not the straight ""truth"" they're someones perception of it, someones cobbled together recollections of it. With Herzog he just goes the extra step. Why have the pretence of reality when we're already reshaping it? Instead why not shift things or add things that can make the reality of the situation even more impactful.    When someone's mouth is moving and conveying a foreign tongue, what brand of ""ecstasy"" gives you license to ignore the fact that words with objective definitions are being delivered, and that whatever personal truth happens to be preoccupying you in the editing room is the only thing that matters?   In the case of Lessons of Darkness it's kind of says something about us based on our reaction. Children and their parents all around will have been affected by the war and its aftermath, do the specifics of that trauma really matter? In this case Herzog doesn't make it about specifics but a general scar over a nation. Maybe it'd be more disingenuous to give one persons specific example and label that as what all have suffered instead of creating a parable that represents all of them. That film in general is more of a reflection on a place and time than a specific series of facts anyway.   I've seen plenty of documentaries that have an interesting subject but nothing else going on with them. There's nothing being said through the filmmaking it's just telling a straight story of what has happened. But all of Herzog's documentaries that I've seen have stuck with me in some way, made me linger on them, and if the occasional non-fact has been a part of that I don't mind. I've gotten so much from those films, thought so much about the subjects, felt like I've gotten truth out of them, been made to feel for another human's experience and learn something on top of it, and that's partially what I watch films for.   I think the essence of Herzogs Ecstatic Truth is that he doesn't just want to convince us of what he's saying point-by-point he wants us to feel it and believe it (though that's kind of edging into the Sublime)."
TrueFilm,3drcjj,a113er,5,Sat Jul 18 19:06:04 2015 UTC,"Okay, complete objectivity in documentary filmmaking is an impossible pretense.  I can accept that.  But I still think there should be a good faith attempt to get as close to it as possible.  Attempting to convey transcendent truths is great, but going out of your way to make a mockery of objective facts in the process--that reeks of laziness to me.  If he wanted to capture the deeper truth of the Gulf War, he should've went out and found it, not invented it by putting words in some poor lady's mouth."
TrueFilm,3drcjj,a113er,8,Sat Jul 18 19:39:16 2015 UTC,"In certain situations I'd agree. If something is a documentary trying to kickstart activism of some kind there is a certain journalistic standard to be held to. Like if Blackfish had faked some of that footage or something that would be out of line as it's straight up saying ""These are the facts, with these facts now known lets make change/boycott"". But like film in general there's room for different types of documentaries. Some make us face reality and some reshape reality to make us face something more internal.   Lessons in Darkness is one where it bothers me least as that film is quite upfrontly non-traditional. Herzog's narration starts as if he's an alien on a foreign planet then later he quotes revelations. He's getting across the feeling of a place and the feeling that has been left behind by catastrophes. When I see the scene of the woman and the child I'm not left thinking about that specific kid but about how many people could be walked up to and tell similar stories."
TrueFilm,3drcjj,F_Scott,2,Sat Jul 18 19:53:03 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to pop in and say I think there's a reason Senna has been so popular (haven't seen Amy but think it's a similar concept) and that's because the documentary isn't based on ""after the fact"" commentary which I think was a huge problem with Blackfish. I beliebe SeaWorld should make changes and release orcas but I struggled with the documentary because all of the employees were making value judgments having known the end of the story. The appeal of say, Senna, is that so little of the footage and commentary is post-mortem but is drawn from before what we know happened, happened. To me, generally speaking, this is one of the best ways for documentarians to approach truth. It absolutely does not negate bias (editing is a massive component), but it's a start."
TrueFilm,3drcjj,afewthoughtsonfilm,9,Sat Jul 18 20:44:03 2015 UTC,"This is a really fascinating topic, one that I've been considering quite a bit myself (although not within the context of Herzog's philosophy; this I had no idea about, but find quite interesting).  It ties back to one of the central questions that has always plagued cinema: how do we create something true to life?  The neorealists approached it one way, by using long takes & non-professional actors in order to remove the artificiality of staged, Hollywood cinema.  The New-Wave crowd tried it a wholly different way, using a variety of techniques to try and create a more real feel whilst simultaneously (and seemingly paradoxically) using even more artificial means within their films (notably Godard and the use of jump-cuts in Breathless).  Documentary is a whole other beast; we take for granted the fact that it uses ""facts"" and most assume that it is merely a format for argument or for learning.  The reality, however, is that documentary should not be so heavily associated with ""fact,"" as it is just as malliable as fiction.  Orson Welles F for Fake, among other films such as The Night it Rained and A Moment of Innocence (or even Rashomon to an extent, despite being a narrative film), go into great detail as to how the presentation of facts, even within the context of a documentary, can be phrased in a variety of ways to create a variety of different meanings that stray away from ""reality.""  I find myself agreeing quite a bit with what Herzog has to say about the Cinema Verité movement, particularly in this point:   the so-called Cinema Verité is devoid of verité. It reaches a merely superficial truth, the truth of accountants.   as well as:   Filmmakers of Cinema Verité resemble tourists who take pictures amid ancient ruins of facts.   The verité approach is a very valuable one, but it doesn't necessarily bring us any closer to actual ""truth,"" at least not as I see it.  In the latter quote, it seems Herzog is referencing the fact that these filmmakers would take their films out of studios and shoot on-location in the real streets of the towns their films were set in.  In one sense, this brings cinema closer to reality - we're actually shooting in the real world - yet in another sense, simply placing the film in the real world doesn't necessarily mean that the film is going to achieve a stronger sense of the ""real world.""  In your OP, you ask the question:   Does pointing a camera at something not convey an objective truth?   My answer would be a resounding no.  Everything we see in film, although shot through the objective lens of the camera, is subject to the manipulation both in the moment and in the editing room of the filmmaker.  For all intents and purposes, I argue that nothing we see in cinema is wholly true.  There are certainly some ethical concerns with what Herzog does in Lessons of Darkness, there is no question of that.  However, I think the point he is trying to make is that the truth, despite our best efforts to make it concrete, is far more elusive than that.  Everything we experience is filtered through our own perceptions, meaning that your perception of ""truth"" and mine can be completely different (look to The Thin Blue Line as an example of this; the driving force of that documentary is how each different witness saw something completely different, which makes it nearly impossible to discern the ""reality"" of that situation).  Therefore, ethics aside, Herzog makes it his point to filter reality through fiction in order to represent deeper, universal, subconscious truths about humanity and nature, truths that aren't as easily perceived as we might think.  There's a great photographer named Larry Sulton who took photos in the San Fernando Valley (I can't link to them because they are NSFW, but PM me and I can show them to you there).  His photos are of unstaged, real things, yet they are often interpreted in the same way we interpret a staged photo of something.  Both Herzog and Sulton, then, can be described as using reality as clay for crafting themes that otherwise would not be observable if we simply used the ""truth"" of the moments to define them.  I hope that makes some sense."
TrueFilm,3drcjj,BorisJonson1593,7,Sat Jul 18 19:15:48 2015 UTC,"There's definitely a lot going on here and without some background in philosophy and/or cinema verite it can be difficult to understand. First off though, let's talk about Herzog's documentaries. I personally adore them precisely because he's not really trying to be objective or trying to present an unbiased, factually accurate account. He's not Ken Burns or even Errol Morris. His documentaries are so colored by his personality and ideology that they're almost not even documentaries. I think that's exactly the point, though. Cinema verite was all about trying to capture some sort of objective truth about the world through the lens of the camera. That really got started by Dziga Vertov's films and writing. It's been a bit since I've read anything from Vertov, but his basic idea was that a movie camera can and should be used as a perfect version of the eye that could reveal the unseen truth of the world around the viewer. He realized that human experience was fleeting and the little details of the world around us were all too easily missed or forgotten unless they were recorded somehow.   Cinema verite is still going on to a degree and there are tons of fascinating examples of different ways it's been deployed. One of the more interesting examples is Ross McElwee's Sherman's March. McElwee was from North Carolina set out to make a documentary about Sherman and how he was a war hero who was and still is reviled. However, it turned into a three and a half hour long documentary about McElwee's failed romantic relationships and anxiety over nuclear annihilation. It's not the most clear cut, Vertov-esque example of cinema verite but I think it's an interesting example of how the style evolved over the decades. Most of the film has the feeling of a home movie because it's all shot by McElwee with a shoulder mounted camera and it's mostly just footage of conversations or of him driving. It's very aimless and McElwee doesn't really seem to have a clear goal, but that actually kind of works in the film's favor. He's basically just trying to occupy himself with something after a traumatic breakup but that lack of narrative or documentarian imposition means you get a really raw, honest look at his life and beliefs.  Okay, Herzog's ecstatic truth.This bit kind of sums it up:   There are deeper strata of truth in cinema, and there is such a thing as poetic, ecstatic truth. It is mysterious and elusive, and can be reached only through fabrication and imagination and stylization.   I think Herzog's ultimate point is that cinema verite and its drive to unveil the hidden, objective truth of the world is in and of itself a fabrication that actually keeps you from understanding the very truth you're trying to get at. I don't think Herzog is a big believer in some sort of objective truth in the first place which is why he came up with ecstatic truth. Herzog thinks that everything is going to be made artificial by our own biases and beliefs and that makes it impossible to be truly objective. Part of the reason why Vertov made cinema verite documentaries was because he saw them as fundamentally communist because they eschewed bourgeois obsessions for an intense focus on the ordinary and the everyday. By only choosing to film ""ordinary"" life and the lower classes Vertov was imposing his biases and belief on his documentaries. This is more speculative, but I think Herzog's underlying idea is that humans are simply incapable of being objective or finding any sort of objective truth because we're always going to be controlled by our biases and beliefs.  However, as that quote illustrates Herzog does believe that film can uncover deeper truths about the world. It's just that these truth can only be reached through our incredible ability for abstraction and artistic creation. By trying to find an objective truth, cinema verite really only scratched the surface. Herzog understands that art is the primary tool through which humans understand the world around them but by trying to be objective cinema verite robs itself of that power. A simpler way to state this might be that Herzog's documentaries are never really about what they're about. I think you could say that for a lot of good documentaries, but Herzog really takes it to a different level. Grizzly Man isn't about Timothy Treadwell. It's about how wrong he thinks our conception of nature and the natural world is. Treadwell is a jumping off point that Herzog uses to explore his beliefs about how hostile, violent and cruel nature often is. Herzog never attempts to hide his beliefs or subsume them in any way. He always puts them at the forefront of his documentaries because that's how he thinks documentaries should be used to find and explore truth. The fact that he uses documentary to do all of this is borderline experimental. It's obviously intentional that he took the one genre of film dedicated to factual truth and objectivity and uses it to explore poetic truth through fabrication and artificiality.  When Herzog interjects or makes things up, he's doing it because that's his conception of the truth of the situation. It doesn't matter to him that the child didn't actually say he wanted to be mute for the rest of his life. That's his interpretation of the horror war inflicts on innocent people. Alternately, there are some really great quotes from Grizzly Man you can look at to see the same thing:   What haunts me, is that in all the faces of all the bears that Treadwell ever filmed, I discover no kinship, no understanding, no mercy. I see only the overwhelming indifference of nature. To me, there is no such thing as a secret world of the bears. And this blank stare speaks only of a half-bored interest in food. But for Timothy Treadwell, this bear was a friend, a savior.  I believe the common denominator of the universe is not harmony, but chaos, hostility, and murder.   If you take the view that documentaries should be objective and factual, then this is deplorable documentary filmmaking. Treadwell loved the bears and thought they were more human than most of the people he actually knew. He'd be horrified to hear Herzog or anybody else say that his bears were indifferent eating machines that tolerated his presence until they began to starve. That's not the point, though. Herzog isn't looking to make a factual account of Treadwell's life and death. He's using Treadwell as a way to explain his beliefs about nature and the natural order of the universe. I think that's really the point of Herzog's ecstatic truth as it relates to documentaries. He sees documentaries just like any other genre or style of film. They can still be a place for artifice and fabrication and a place where you abstract about the real world as a way to understand it."
TrueFilm,3drcjj,PeterKien,8,Sat Jul 18 20:37:17 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you have made this thread. I linked, a few days ago, Herzog's thoughts on ecstatic truth in another thread here on /r/truefilm concerning revolutionary filmmakers, which I definitely think Herzog is. Unfortunately it did not raise a further discussion (or any upboats) so I will just go ahead and link it again here.  I think the key to understanding Herzog's concept of ecstatic truth requires one to delve into the murky waters of German and French sociology, philosophy, anthropology and psychology of the mid 20th century. I will be name dropping and throwing different concepts around with little regard to their apparent utility, in part because I'm simply not well versed enough to authoritatively give a thorough account of these thinkers and their thoughts, and in part because I think people should do their own homework, if they find it curious and relevant. Persons such as Hegel, Heidegger, Husserl, Ricoeur, Merleau-Ponty and Levi-Strauss, to name a few from the top of my head, are whom I'm thinking of. It has been some years since I myself have been immersed in such topics, and I'm at work and don't have my dusty college books at my disposal, so they are by no means at the forefront of my memory, but I cannot help but think of especially Claude Levi-Strauss when I read of Herzog's ecstatic truth. Please bear with me, and anybody more well versed in continental philosophy should really chime in here and help me out.  In short, I see Herzog as a filmmaking Phenomenologist, meaning that he is primarily concerned with the study of experience and consciousness. But not a study in an academic or scientific sense, but a poetic, visual study through film as a medium, which we can all agree is vastly different than the written word. It is worth noting that Herzog had a brief stint at Munich University before becoming a filmmaker, where he studied history and literature, so it is a safe bet that he has had at least an introduction to people such as Hegel and Wittgenstein, and other such important figures. I do remember vaguely from some commentary track or interview with Herzog that he said himself he would have become a philosopher had he not become a filmmaker - this is an important clue to understanding Herzog, and why I have name dropped important thinkers in the first place. Herzog should be seen as hybrid filmmaking philosopher, or philosopher filmmaker, or a visual poet, or whatever suits your fancy. He is not only a filmmaker, and he obviously draws upon existing academic theory to make his films, and to further his idea of ecstatic truth (which I honestly don't find to be very original, but 'merely' a condensation of existing thought into his own, which is not to say that this is a bad thing, at all).  Back to Levi-Strauss: Levi-Strauss was a pioneer of what is known as structuralist anthropology, and was academically interested, among other topics, in myths and how they are constituted in our thoughts and language. Inspired by a dusty old dude (de Saussure), who was a very influential linguist and semiotician, Levi-Strauss thought that beneath a myth there was an underlying language to be discovered. And, furthermore, that underlying a myth was a so-called mytheme, which is a fundamental unit of a myth, something that underlies all versions of a myth and is thus central to them all - an underlying language of a myth, if you will. For me, this is where Levi-Strauss and Herzog meet on a conceptual level. Herzog is, just as Levi-Strauss, interested in the myth making of humans, and how our myths help constitute our language and Being. Timothy Treadwell was living in his own myth, but a myth that was part of a grander, more overreaching myth of humanity. To expose that grand myth, we must look at this small version of it, with little regard to the actual person of interest(Treadwell). But he doesn't go about exposing and explaining these myths in the same methodological approach as Levi-Strauss (for, remember, Herzog is visual poet, right?) but instead uses imagery and his own narration as tools to make the viewer, subconsciously, understand what he is trying to get at. I think this is evident in especially a little known film(mockumentary) by Zak Penn, starring Herzog as himself, called Incident at Loch Ness, that spoofs not only Herzog and his style of filmmaking, but also brings to light some of the techniques that Herzog uses in his own films. I'm getting a little nervous now that this is becoming too academic, in part because I feel a little in over my head, so I will stop here, and hope someone else will pick up the slack. If you think there is something to my idea of Levi-Strauss, and others, being the true inspirations for Herzog's concept of ecstatic truth, I would suggest doing some wiki surfing or visiting http://plato.stanford.edu/ which has good entries on a lot of the people I've name dropped in this post. This is something that I've only recently begun wondering about (Herzog's academic inspirations), so it is by no means fully thought through or actually correct, but I hope it can serve as inspiration for further reading."
TrueFilm,3drcjj,Vietnom,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:41:25 2015 UTC,What is the background of ecstatic truth? The link you provided barely mentions it.

TrueFilm,3drtab,Gnarbage,27,Sat Jul 18 21:04:56 2015 UTC,"Editing is the most important component when it comes to dictating a film's tempo. The rapid cutting in 'Fury Road' perfectly fits the film's pacing and tone. I completely agree with you that there are moments in the film that are completley missed but that's the point, the chase scenes are supposed to feel totally erratic and frantic and all over the place. Imagine if 'Fury Road' was cut like a minimalist mumblecore, it would lose all of it's intensity. Saying that, I think a big influence is also just cultural differences between how particular genre's should be cut. In that Jackie Chan video, he specifically talks about fist fights and in particular his personal fighting ability to be properly showcased without the disruption of too many cuts. Personally I don't think that kind of style would've worked for 'Fury Road'."
TrueFilm,3drtab,pepper_head,7,Sat Jul 18 22:53:01 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think that kind of style would've worked for 'Fury Road'.   Fully agree. Medium shots work nicely for Jackie Chan's fight scenes. For extended car chase/car battles it would be boring.  There is some really nice editing in Fury Road. In the midst of many of the action scenes, we get a re-establishing wide shot that pans back in to the action."
TrueFilm,3drtab,jghaines,3,Sun Jul 19 07:37:24 2015 UTC,"'The Road Warrior' didn't use rapid cutting and, personally, I much preferred its action set pieces over 'Fury Road'. I like the anticipation of what is going to happen and then fully realizing visually the result. Fury Road often left me bored. Just felt like noise. Perhaps it's a generational thing, as I saw The Road Warrior when it first came out and it became one of my favorite movies as a kid."
TrueFilm,3drtab,IKidIKidIKid,2,Sun Jul 19 10:13:41 2015 UTC,"The Road Warrior definitely uses some fast cuts, but it's generally restricted to the crashes. I remember quick flashes of faces during the crash sequences. It thought it was very effective in making every crash seem jarring and brutal though."
TrueFilm,3drtab,isarge123,18,Sun Jul 19 13:49:30 2015 UTC,"I actually never had this problem. I don't mind when a film has really fast editing, fast editing is a tool and when appropriate it works wonders. Use it too much and you get problems (like most techniques). That being said there is such a thing as great fast editing and I feel this film used it appropriately. One thing I remember Miller talking about a lot about during interviews and behind the scenes footage was center frame. For almost every action scene all of the action would happen in the center of the frame, not only making the movement a lot more easy to follow, but making the shot transitions significantly smoother. You can see the process of this in this article. 20 years ago a lot of action happened in wide shots and minimalist movement, but now we have seen a transition to chaos cinema that uses cuts to dictate the intensity. This can work really well but a lot of modern film-makers screw this up by botching their screen geography (Dark Knight, Quantum of Solace) or they overestimate what the human eye is able to perceive (Transformers). This is what makes mad max so great, It uses maximum cuts to create more of an impact but manages to respect the human eye and maintain screen continuity.   Note: If you follow Tony Zhou on twitter you will know that he considers Fury Road to have the best editing of this decade (or at least best since the Social Network). Something that really frustrates me (and this is not targeted at you OP) is when people like Chris Stuckmann say ""action works best in wideshots"". No it doesn't, it works best when it fits the scene. It's not that fast editing is bad, it's just that a lot of the time it is miss used or horribly done. It's a relatively new tool and we need to get better at using it. Hopefully from now on Mad Max is not the exception, it's the standard."
TrueFilm,3drtab,jburd22,3,Sun Jul 19 04:11:48 2015 UTC,"I think Chris's statement contains some truth but is poorly worded. It's a pretty understandable backlash to the near constant shaky close-ups in recent action films. Once The Boune films were released a lot of filmmakers started using shaky-cam and heaps of really tight shots when it wasn't appropriate, either because they thought it made the fights more intense or because they were trying to hide poor choreography/stuntwork.   Good action sequences aren't very common nowadays, but yes, not all action needs to be told in wide shots. Fast cuts and tight shots can be used effectively, but sadly they're being overused in the industry."

You understand what the characters are trying to do by that point, you've spent all the rest of the movie seeing what's happening clearly. So I think it's on purpose: at the climax things start happening too quickly for anyone involved to do more than react, and Joe is dead before he knows what's going on. It's different from all the other movies lately that want you to be disoriented all the time. It's a pretty small thing really, that just makes the movie more rewatchable."

Other industries have been trying lately to appeal the millennials as a monolithic consumer group. Most haven't done it very well. Even if they did, it would be condescending and not likely very good.  I don't think today's movies speak to me either. I might be a poster child millennial in many ways but I'm also an individual. But many people I know can't get enough of superheroes. This is the pop culture of your time, like it not. There's probably not something better around the corner. There is no reason to expect the maturity of millennials to coincide with some kind of artistic revival in filmmaking. The opposite, if anything. Most of the young filmmakers that represent our generation in Hollywood havent done or havent been allowed to do anything very interesting.   Even if there was any kind of cultural movement not yet controlled by the commercial powers that be, you probably wouldn't join it anyway. They usually find a way to buy or kill it before too long.  And Game of Thrones is not well-written, at least not anymore.  Find the films that speak to you, don't expect them to be the big movies of the season."
TrueFilm,3drzty,lordhadri,3,Sat Jul 18 22:28:49 2015 UTC,"An idea that has been put forth as to why modern blockbusters are dumbed down relative to older blockbusters is because of the rise of the importance of the foreign markets. While American millenials might be better educated and more visually-literate than past generations, making movies smarter for them would prevent foreign audiences from understanding them with the same kind of depth. I think that's here to stay, honestly. Foreign audiences are likely only going to become more and more important in the near future and I think that we're going to see them maintain a certain level of influence for years to come. They're probably never going to be as relatively unimportant as they were twenty years ago ever again.   As /u/lordhadri said, the movies that speak to you probably aren't going to be blockbusters, anyways. I mean, they're designed to appeal to as many people as possible. The likelihood that they cater to your tastes more than, say, your neighbor's is a toss-up. Look to Oscar-bait (a catch-all term that I'm applying to every movie that comes out of Hollywood that is more serious or intellectually stimulating than a blockbuster, because I can't think of a more succinct way of putting that) and indie movies instead. Blockbusters tend to be action movies, but Oscar-bait and indie movies encompass pretty much every other kind of movie out there. You're simply more likely to find something you like there, unless you only like action movies.   Did you mean to say that Hunger Games and Guardians of the Galaxy are examples of spectacle becoming more important? I've never heard anyone praise GotG because of the story, and people usually like Hunger Games because of badass Katniss action, not really the overarching plot (although that just might be my personal experience). If you did mean that spectacle was becoming less important, I'd point to Mad Max: Fury Road and Jurassic World as very recent counter-examples. These are movies that exist almost entirely for their respective spectacles. Fury Road's story was very bare-bones and Jurassic World's story was just outright bad. But both of those movies made a lot of money because Fury Road was amazing at pretty much everything else and Jurassic World had dinosaurs. The popularity of the Fast & Furious and Transformers movies are also good counter-examples.   The Chinese government has only become more and more open to Western sensibilities over the years, not less (since Mao came to power, anyways). American movies have been popular overseas in general for decades at this point, so we're still going to see American movies played in China, even if they lose the majority of the Chinese audiences to Chinese productions. American movies still do well in India, after all.   You can't cherry-pick what are considered some of the best blockbusters ever made and put them up against other blockbusters. That's just not fair. Besides, stuff that good is still being made. Look at the universally-loved Fury Road: that's a movie that deals with intellectual themes like Jaws and Star Wars and made a boat-load of money. I'd say it's better technically than Star Wars, and not that far off from Jaws (haven't seen that one in a while, though, so that might just be memory failing me). Independence Day. Die Hard. Terminator. Titanic. Are movies like The Avengers and Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier really worse than them? Christopher Nolan's Batman movies are better than them. Man of Steel is about on par. Inception and Interstellar are two blockbusters that are also good examples of things not being entirely shit. Avatar is a blockbuster about man vs. nature and I think we all know how well that did financially. Things might be a little worse, but I really don't think that we can claim that we're in some kind of age of bad movies. Especially when it only takes one to look past non-blockbusters to see that a large number of really good movies are being made.  Edit: 245 million dollars in profit is not in any way ""a small commercial success."" If those numbers are correct, then Transformers: AoE made more than twice its budget. That's a massive success, and I wouldn't be surprised if we saw another Transformers movie based off those numbers alone, never mind what it made overseas.    Second edit: Can someone point me to these movies that are Chinese-funded and reflect China in a positive light because of that? I keep hearing people bring that up like its endemic to American blockbusters, but I can't think of any recent movies I've seen that are like that. Then again, I don't usually watch blockbuster-type movies, so maybe that's the problem? Any movies anyone can point me towards?"

Are Americans still consoling themselves with this shameless lie, that foreign audiences are responsible for the dumbed-down movies coming out of Hollywood?  How can anyone, in good faith, give credence to this statement when objectively well-made films are so poorly attended by Americans?  Just look up the measly grosses of such films: Boyhood (25M), Birdman (42M), Whiplash (13M), Nightcrawler (32M), Inside Llewyn Davis (13M), Blue Jasmine (33M), Dallas Buyers Club (27M), Ex Machina (25M), Me and Earl and the Dying Girl (6M).  To say nothing of the fact that most Americans still consider attending foreign-produced films to be torturous.  Continuing to scapegoat foreign audiences for the shlocky movies coming out of HW is in poor taste, if not downright repugnant.  And what are the movies that play more to American tastes?

TrueFilm,3drzty,cubebreak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:59:41 2015 UTC,"I think part of the problem is that films no longer hold the central spot in entertainment they did decades ago.  There are too many competing modes of entertainment to really have a thriving film market the way that existed previously.  People can engage themselves in thousands of internet communities and narratives and engage with all sorts of different narrative media. So the films that remain visible in popular culture are the ones with giant spectacle that couldn't be produced in longer formats like television.  I do think there has been an uptrend in quality in recent years, big special effects is no longer a guarantee of box office success and the story quality of big budget movies has been getting incrementally better, even if its not quite to the standard I would like.  Of course resources and knowledge about filmmaking is also much more widespread so there's naturally more great films out there than ever, but I don't think we can ever expect these films to become dominant in culture again considering all the competing narratives and communities people get involved in on the internet.  Television has largely replaced film as the dominant medium for character driven storytelling.  Feature films in theaters exist and maintain there place in culture so long as they continue to showcase the highest technology that can be produced in 90 minute stories.  People who care about film history will continue to make great films for cinephiles, but I don't think this will ever escape being one of many subcultures for people who've invested a lot of time and interest in the topic."
TrueFilm,3drhgh,Pseudo-esque,19,Sat Jul 18 19:21:05 2015 UTC,"I concur with Boris here. If you're gonna look mainly at Western cinema, then you're dealing with Western creators who draw from their sources of knowledge, which is largely Western folklore, fantasy, and history.  To experience a greater breadth of fantastic mythologies, you may want to explore outside of Western cinema. There are numerous Chinese films, for example, that draw on Chinese folklore, fantasy, and history. For a starting point, I'm gonna suggest The Bride With the White Hair. You could also check out Stephen Chow's Journey to the West.  There have also been some fantasy films that are idiosyncratic to their creator's vision. Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth comes to mind. Also, Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. (And Miyazaki's Spirited Away is likely influenced by Japanese folklore.)"
TrueFilm,3drhgh,strangenchanted,18,Sun Jul 19 02:07:49 2015 UTC,"It's all Tolkien's fault.  He introduced the fantasy genre as we now know it, along with a few predecessors like Robert E. Howard and Fritz Leiber.  Their vision was mostly inspired by Norse mythology but ended up basically being set in medieval Europe.  As LOTR became the most popular fantasy series ever written, it pretty much codified what a fantasy setting was."
TrueFilm,3drhgh,Sadsharks,4,Sat Jul 18 21:00:23 2015 UTC,"I think LOTR less codified what a fantasy setting was and more confirmed Beowulf as what a fantasy setting was, which makes sense since Tolkien did much scholarly work on Beowulf and even wrote his own translation."
TrueFilm,3drhgh,logopolys_,9,Sun Jul 19 18:16:49 2015 UTC,"The majority of Hollywood directors are and have been white people of European descent. They make movies about medieval European fantasy and mythology because it's all they really know. If you want to see different fantasy worlds, you probably need to look to other countries and continents. I'm not nearly as familiar with Bollywood as I would like to be but I'm more than sure that there are Bollywood films based off of Indian mythology. A lot of Nollywood movies (side note: I really hate that term and all its baggage but it's less unwieldy than Nigerian video movies or some of the other alternate names) deal with African tribal culture (another term I'm loathe to use) and witchcraft in interesting and often problematic ways. There's a Nigerian-American streaming service called irokoTV that has an entire category dedicated to fictional movies about Nigerian history and folklore. A lot of these movies tend to be melodramatic rather than action oriented, but some of them are very good. Kunle Afolayan's The Figurine is a particularly interesting example of a mixture of modern day melodrama with Nigerian folklore and mythology.  There are also quite a few Japanese films that draw heavily from their folklore, particularly older horror movies. Some examples might be Obayashi's House or Shindo's Kuroneko and Onibaba. Alternately, a lot of Kurosawa's jidaigeki films drew pretty heavily from Japanese folklore. Rashoman, Kagemusha, and Seven Samurai all come to mind immediately and even Yojimbo and Sanjuro can be seen that way a bit. Of course, you also have Ran and Throne of Blood where he mixed Shakespearean tragedy with Japanese history and folklore to pretty fantastic results.  Anyways, like I said earlier people in America think of medieval Europe when they hear fantasy because it's really all they know. It's hard to make a movie about Indian or Japanese or African fantasy (""African"" with as many scare quotes around it as possible. Egyptian mythology is completely different from Nigerian mythology which is completely different from Senegalese mythology and on and on. Even within individual countries it's often very muddled. Just in Nigeria you have the Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba plus a couple hundred other ethnic groups with their own unique histories and mythologies) when you aren't the least bit familiar with the folklore and mythology and those cultures."

If the theme of The Town was ""violence begets violence"" then the alternate ending would work.

It has a hint of those down beat 70's movie endings where no one really gets away (which I always loved). Part of the reason the ending of AHX works is because throughout the movie, they're hinting towards the ending and who is really being affected, where as in The Town, you just get the one shot of the guys he's assaulted and that's it. And while it might be a nice way to emphasize the inability to escape your choices (a favorite theme of mine I might add), it likely would have just felt like Deus ex machina. It definitely could work if the movie gave another nod to the people assaulted at the start at some point, which would in turn recontextualize everything we saw leading up to it (my favorite type of ending), but without that reminder towards the end (or even in the middle, just as a small ""hey, this shoe hasn't dropped yet"") it would probably just feel forced.   To answer your larger question though, full redemptions rarely feel earned to me. Maybe it's the masochist in me, but I prefer characters to be unable to escape their choices and past actions. I think it's a more honest depiction. In real life, people carry their baggage with them everywhere they go. It's just there, whether we want it to be or not. Good actors can give you that sense, but it's definitely a tough thing to get across."
TrueFilm,3dp91i,goinnowheremcfly,3,Sat Jul 18 07:32:54 2015 UTC,"Like /u/SmartToaster said, I think the scene where they beat the Hispanic guys up works regardless because it demonstrates the nature of their relationship.

But I feel like if he just happened to run into the same guys he beat up and they killed him, it would be so coincidental as to be nearly unbelievable. Sometimes criminals do get away.

Boston is actually a very small town. Charlestown is an even smaller town. Small-town dynamics are the implicit source of the tension in every other part of the story. It's why Doug is so cautious about everything, including his relationship with Claire. He's not just hiding from his team, he lives in a town where everyone knows you or someone you know. Everyone knows everyone else's business. You expect it. It shapes your world. He's trying to hide in plain sight, but he knows it's impossible.  The men he beat lived walking distance from Claire and he lives pretty close by as well. These people are all neighbors. The chance of them crossing paths just walking down the street isn't unlikely. But I believe in the alternate ending, they don't stumble into him. They're looking for him. Jem showed his face, and there's a pretty high likelihood they saw him on the news because he was killed the shootout. Doug's picture is probably splattered all over the place as well. Doug is a bank robber, and the story beats us over the head with the fact that that ALL OF THE BANK ROBBERS IN BOSTON LIVE IN CHARLESTOWN and everyone knows this.

The assault scene is a minor part of the movie, and is basically completely out of place without the ending that ties it together. I   That actually sounds a lot like the ending to Carlito's Way, which in many ways is a very similar movie.  I'm not crazy about The Town, but I do find it to be a watchable film. It was very ham-fisted at times, the very obvious redemption arc being a part of that. The film practically shouts things at the viewer- Ben Affleck is conflicted! Jeremy Renner is a loose cannon! ""You're gonna rob the cathedral of Boston!"" and so on.  It doesn't do subtlety very well. At least with Heat (another predecessor this film closely resembles) Michael Mann uses a (though albeit slightly) lighter touch when imbuing the characters with anxiety and the feeling of pressure that come as a result of their actions.   And on a side note, Blake Lively just didn't fit in her role. Not for one minute did I buy her as a washed out New England junkie, no matter how hard she tried to sell it.

Whether or not he chose his path or was shaped by his surroundings is immaterial: he is what he is, and he knows that he deserves to be held accountable for his actions. Doug is Jem, but he thinks that he isn't.

DFW was a fascinating guy in person, to listen to or to watch, and I value every hour of interview I can find of him. It was wonderful to see Segel bring that presence to life again, and to see him interpret how Wallace behaved outside of an interview.  What I believe might trouble Wallace is that we have a movie that honors a man, but not his work. There's really nothing in The End of the Tour about his fiction or his essays. OP's review said it correctly—this is a hagiography. The people who are going to love this are those (myself included) who flock to hear the words and wash the feet of St. David.   On the other hand, it seems like the message Wallace was always trying to get at was that if we were to ever escape our loneliness, it would be through honest heart-to-heart conversation. Fiction, essays, interviews—they all offer a certain safe distance from real human interaction. In that light, I think Wallace would be sympathetic to what the movie was doing. It's still a movie—the viewer is still hiding from a distance—but it's trying to illustrate how people can interact and in the end possibly learn how to open up to one another.  The attention to eating and smoking in the film is also wonderful."

A beautiful portrait of two men trying to dig through layers of preconceptions, pop culture and junk food to try and come to an understanding of one another.   I don't know if I would say that it relies on paparazzi footage. Are you accusing Eisenberg's character of being a paparazzi? Because I wouldn't consider in-depth character profiling and extensive interviewing to be paparazzi-like. And I would hardly say that it's exploitative. Is there anything present in the film, specifically regarding the portrayal of the dead author, that feels intellectually dishonest? Because that sounds like baggage you're bringing to the film."

And I shared your perception of the film as beautiful and introspective, in particular with regard to the emptiness of pop culture.  However, while the film may not be intentionally exploitative, it is inevitable that it is exploitative. As I wrote in linked review, the book upon which the film was based, called Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself: A Road Trip with David Foster Wallace, was written only after DFW's death and canonization as another tragic artistic genius driven to suicide. In fact, Lipsky (played by Eisenberg) never even published Rolling Stone article he was assigned.   Thus, like Amy and Montage of Heck, both of which are highly critical of the celebrity-worshipping pop culture that apparently killed their subjects, while simultaneously relying on paparazzi footage, there is a hypocrisy inherent in The End of the Tour, one that I think DFW would have hated. People will see the movie because DFW is their hero, and DFW is in part their hero because he was painted that way by a media that loves, more than anything, when a person is destroyed by fame. So while the film may be deft in its criticism of pop culture, it is simultaneously an act of the very culture it condemns."

TrueFilm,3dn2yp,hrgilbert,16,Fri Jul 17 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"I really like the Filmspotting podcast, which is based out of Chicago. They're show is usually split into two sections — a review of a film (~20-30 minutes), and a discussion about something that is present in that film (usually). For example, they would do a review of Good Fellas and then discuss the top 5 director/actor relationships (because De Niro and Scorcese worked so much together).  They're really unpretentious, but intelligent and well-discussed. Highly recommend them. If you want to get an idea about the show in general, look up the two shows they spent on the top 10 films from 2014."

He has some very depthfull reviews of some of the last years best films in which he doesnt go into really really depths of it but explains a lot about the movie itself and its cons and pros.   He also did 3 essays Horror (which is my favorite) City of God and The French new wave and are hands down one of the best videos this type out there if you are looking for examples and explanations of a certain genre.  And ofcourse he did 2 over-an hour analyses about both Apocalyse Now and Taxi Driver. If you ever looked for an ""in-depth"" analysis of the film this should speak for itself. Apocalypse Now analysis is a must-see.  Link to the channel  Brandon Tenold  He usually reviews old ""bad"" movies that are not necessarily bad for their time but over the years didnt age that well and look kinda silly. But he doesnt only bash those movies for the sole reason of bashing them he also reviews what exactly is wrong with the movie and always brings in question things like plot holes (esecially in kaiju movies), bad acting, over the top things and such and in the end you indeed understand why is it ""bad"".   I especially like his reviews of some Godzilla movies, you should check him out if you are interested in these kind of things.  Link to the channel"

As far as something like Episodes 25 and 26 of NGE, I'm not quite sure there's much else like it. As far as technique goes, the usage of voiceover and still frames remind me greatly of Chris Marker's classic short film La Jetee if you haven't seen that, though I'm not quite sure it has the same metafictional qualities that NGE does, as it's been years since I've last viewed it. If anyone else has recommendations here I'd be glad to hear them."

The End of Evangelion does seem like a fusion between 2001 and Eraserhead.  Granted, it isn't as down-right disgusting and grotesque (in the best way) as Eraserhead."

What sticks out to me most after viewing it wasn't the dystopian setting, but instead the warm moments between the man and his love.  La Jetee is imbued in a nostalgia that gives it warmth.  The memories the man had were tender, the past was idealized.  And I think that's what makes it such a touching love story and also what makes it such a tragic love story."

TrueFilm,3dn2yp,afewthoughtsonfilm,6,Sun Jul 19 03:00:28 2015 UTC,"For fans of Harold Lloyd, could someone try to explain the appeal?  To be frank, I find that his films, even his most acclaimed like Safety Last and The Freshman, are exceptionally shallow when compared to the works of Keaton and Chaplin.  His stunts don't hold a candle to Keaton's and his stories rarely have the heart of a Chaplin film.  What is his signature - if he has one - that draws people to him?  I figure there must be something that gives him enough acclaim to be considered an equal to Chaplin and Keaton and not someone on the level of Charley Chase, Fatty Arbuckle, etc. etc."
TrueFilm,3dn2yp,TheGreatZiegfeld,5,Fri Jul 17 17:50:41 2015 UTC,"I always found him to be a soft middle ground between Keaton and Chaplin. He's more athletic than Chaplin, and more silly than Keaton. Keaton and Chaplin are kind of contrasts, so one wouldn't be as fun without the other. Lloyd is a little bit of both, and a slight bit his own.  While I admit to thinking Safety Last is one of the best silent slapsticks out there, most of Lloyd's films don't equal to Chaplin or Keaton. Why? I'd argue directors.  Chaplin had himself for all his features, and he knew how to direct his style.   Keaton had a multitude of directors. Eddie Clyne, John Blystone, Donald Crisp, himself, Clyde Bruckman, James Horne, Charles Reisner, and Edward Sedgwick, to name a few. He directed many of his own films though, either with these professionals, or solo. He clearly had a reign on what his films direction would be.  Lloyd mostly stuck with the same two directors, Fred Newmeyer and Sam Taylor. Most of the time, they worked together, but that was because they were shitty when apart. (Newmeyer made Grandma's Boy by himself, Taylor made Coquette by himself) Late in the silent era, other directors were featured, like in The Kid Brother, which had a total of four directors, including Lloyd, not including Newmeyer or Taylor, and Speedy, which was worked on solely by Ted Wilde, who also worked on The Kid Brother.  Chaplin directed his own films, Keaton was behind the scenes on his own films, Lloyd relied off others, and none of those he worked with were especially talented, with an exception of Lewis Milestone as an uncredited director on The Kid Brother. Sure, Newmeyer and Taylor occasionally did something right, but they were so reliant off each other, and so unpredictable, Lloyd's films would obviously not hold up as well as the more personal Chaplin's or Keaton's works."

TrueFilm,3dn2yp,OWLIE108,6,Sat Jul 18 08:30:01 2015 UTC,"Hi all,  Relatively new film enthusiast, willing to learn about the art of cinema so I can enrich my understanding of films rather than just switching my brain off and forget about it after eating some popcorn. After writing for and watching TV for many years, I believe my progress has stagnated due to my lack of understanding of cinema as a whole as a visual art.  My question to begin with: How does one objectively decide and/or understand whether a film is actually good or not. What factors do you consider to be the most important when judging a film's quality in the sense that we can say the film is 'good' or 'bad'. I know that people's opinions of a film are often evoked from relating to film's subject matter/themes or the film's ability to convey particular emotions that we can all experience.  How do you all judge it?"
TrueFilm,3dn2yp,solitarysniper,8,Fri Jul 17 22:12:50 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all, I'd remove the word ""Objectively"". Other than that, it's mainly about judging what the movie is trying to do and whether it's successful for you in doing it.   Hopefully someone less tired and more intelligent than me can write something better."
TrueFilm,3dn2yp,myspicymeatballs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:55:53 2015 UTC,"I thought so, and thanks for the reply. would you say that objectivity only comes to play for technical details then?

TrueFilm,3dn2yp,TheyShootFilmDntThey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:42:51 2015 UTC,"Not the person you asked but I think it's more than technical details. One principle that helps me with character development and stories is ""show not tell."" Basically if a movie is able to set up a character to have certain traits in a very skillful way, so as you hardly notice what the film is trying to do.   A very simple example is a character coming up with a smart solution to a problem instead of someone rattling off how he's a professor and he's won so and so award.  In story development the prime example of this is Primer (hah). It's a good example of a movie that makes you work in some ways to understand what is happening. It doesn't tell the audience much, but shows them a complex story for them to unravel.  And I guess even these things aren't signs of a good movie but a more deep or complex movie. Idk if this is entirely coherent. One way I try to do this is by constantly thinking, what was that dialogue or plot line trying to do and how does it relate to the rest of the movie. Very hard to do that while zoned out.  Hope this helps"
TrueFilm,3dn2yp,ReckoningGotham,7,Sat Jul 18 00:49:10 2015 UTC,"Best and most important thing to do is, first, watch everything you can. Haze yourself. Watch things you've heard of as well as things you haven't. See a healthy dose of the confirmed classics but also sneak in things that seem unappealing, out of your wheelhouse, or even bad.   Be especially mindful of ""bad movies"" -- and keep track of when you happen to disagree with the consensus. Same for ""great"" movies.   The more you watch, the easier to pick up on trends of what you like/don't like, and once you pick up on those trends, you can start articulating Why you feel the way you do. And you can start holding yourself accountable to the assumptions you bring to films as a spectator; you can start breaking down those assumptions and challenging yourself.

It's the culmination of so much of what he learned over the course of his career, but it's also not at all representative, because it's much, much darker. (His wife died during filming; also, he'd attempted suicide sometime before making it; and it's an adaptation of King Lear, which is dark in itself, but given that Shakespeare was at least a little sympathetic toward the Lear character, Kurosawa's take is especially ruthless by even those standards.)    I would start with films like Rashomon, Yojimbo, maybe Ikiru, or even Seven Samurai; I would build up to Kagemusha, Ran, or the later works generally.   Ran is my favorite though, and you wouldn't be hurting yourself by starting there. :)"

TrueFilm,3dn2yp,al455,2,Sat Jul 18 00:15:04 2015 UTC,"I have kind of a basic question which has been a bit puzzling for me. When do you know whether the visual art style of a film can be credited to the director or the cinematographer (director of photography)? Being a recent film enthusiast, I hear people credit Akira Kurosawa for his work in Seven Samurai but not his cinematographer. In other instances, Roger Deakins is the one who gets the credit for his work. It's a weird but irritating question I've had for a while."
TrueFilm,3dn2yp,tonequality,6,Sat Jul 18 04:35:12 2015 UTC,"When a director has a well worked-out visual style, you can always tell it's them behind the movie no matter who is shooting. Photographers have their own preferences as they do their job and so the look of the movie reflects that. Directors know that and sometimes use it to their advantage, like Wong Kar-Wai changing DoP halfway through Chungking Express when the story changes radically.  Terrence Malick, an accomplished photographer himself, has worked with five different photographers on his six movies. You can tell which ones were shot by Lubezki, which are distinctly different from the one shot by Toll and so forth. The Thin Red Line is a blue-green movie largely shot from a crane; Lubezki's colors look more natural and he uses handheld much more. Yet, all six movies are obviously Malick, even across his development over a forty year career. On the other hand, Days of Heaven changed DoPs halfway through production, but you can't tell, because the new one tried to stay consistent with what was already done.  Deakins is one of the few who is a well-known name, and one reason is because his photography has its own personality. Nevertheless, the Coen brothers movies are consistently their style, different from Deakins' work with others."

I've never seen any Truffaut, only knowing him a little via Hitchcock, and for Herzog only Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, which I liked a lot for the unique tone and stellar central performance of Nic Cage. I can't decide between the Herzog collection, or the Antoine Doinel set which has The 400 Blows which has been on my watch list for a long time. There's also a Truffaut collection which has more films, and I'd love any advice on whether they're worth it over The 400 Blows. I realise both directors will be unique in their own ways but if anyone could enlighten me as to which boxset would be the best starting point (I intend to get all three eventually), I'd appreciate it.

Also there is another Herzog collection that came out recently here for about the same price. They both have all of the major films, but differ on some of the minor ones. I think this collection is a bit better (though I haven't seen all the films from either collection)."
TrueFilm,3dn2yp,DrMephistopheles,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:32:46 2015 UTC,"do not start with 8 1/2, check out some other fellini films first (any other would do but la dolce vita is the most popular one i guess). I really did not find it that accessible."
TrueFilm,3dn2yp,TheGreatZiegfeld,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:14:12 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd just watch The 400 Blows and Jules And Jim to determine whether you like Fellini's style, then get the set if you (hopefully) do.   I recommend starting with La Strada or La Dolce Vita. They're both much simpler plot wise and a more accessible start to Fellini. Hope that helps!"
TrueFilm,3dn2yp,eastkino,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:06:38 2015 UTC,"My vote is for Herzog as well.  As much as I love French new wave, Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo are some of the most ambitious films ever made.  Aguirre being the haunting pinnacle of Herzog in my opinion.    As for starting with Fellini, La Dolce Vida is indeed a bit more accessible as someone mentioned.  However, 8 1/2 is a film which truly blew me awa and made me want to consume all things Fellini afterwards.  For a look at one of my favorite characters of his and an emotional kick I would also check out Nights of Cabiria."
TrueFilm,3dn2yp,TheGreatZiegfeld,3,Sun Jul 19 12:18:43 2015 UTC,"Anyone who's familiar with Bela Tarr's films, can I get some sort of overview of his films and style? He's a director I've always wanted to get into, so I'm curious.  As well, for someone region 1 such as myself, is there any reliable place to find his films? I imagine The Turin Horse isn't especially difficult to find, but the others I would appreciate, anything from his late 70's stuff to now would be greatly appreciated."
TrueFilm,3dn2yp,eastkino,5,Sat Jul 18 03:53:19 2015 UTC,"For Region 1 Bela Tarr you are pretty much out of luck. His recent films are easy to find copies of but for his earliest films you need to turn to Facet for region 1 with most of those discs being out of print. His later films are the most inaccessible, they eschew traditional narrative and focus on long takes and imagery. His earliest films are the most traditional, such as Családi tűzfészek, but can be just as inaccessible because they focus more on the cultural and political state of Hungary. That isn't to say that it's not equally true for his contemporary work. Part of the idea behind Sátántangó's length is that Hungary was in a period of standstill, political reform seemed impossible and life in the Eastern Bloc was homogeneous with little change. Life felt like nothing more than just existing. It's also important to not to view the films solely as attacks on the socialist political system. You have to understand that politics influenced everything, your job, how much you were paid, the cost of food, what you could and couldn't read or watch. Because politics controlled every aspect of your life, its hard to separate discussing themes or ideas without bringing socialism into the equation. This leads to a film industry of auteurs who didn't necessarily want to make political films but discussing ideas such as mortality or humanism within the context of Hungary made socialism inescapable. In terms of understanding Tarr's style, you are fortunate in that he is pretty well written about in English. I can easily recommend The Cinema of Béla Tarr: The Circle Closes if you want to understand more about his films, Slow Movies: Countering the Cinema of Action if you want to learn more about the aesthetics of slow cinema, In Dwelling: Implacability, Exclusion and Acceptance as an essay exploring some of the central themes of Tarr's films. Unfortunately if you want to watch more Hungarian cinema you are truly at a loss. Almost none of the important films have made it to the west, outside of the work of Miklós Jancsó. Hungarian DVD's themselves are cheap and easy to import. MaNDA is a DVD label that includes English subtitles on all of the main features and sometimes the extras and film commentaries. The Hungarian DVD releases of Tarr's films are also English friendly though the discs are encoded for PAL. If you need any more resources please feel free to message me. Sorry, I got distracted many times writing out this message and if anything is confusing I will gladly clarify it."

I have seen one Jancso film, and loved it, so I'm not completely new to Hungarian cinema, but it's a shame it's so hard to access over here.  I'll really keep those thoughts in mind if I ever get to his films. I've enjoyed slow cinema like Jeanne Dielman, Solaris, and Norte: The End of History, so I imagine Tarr wont be so bad on that front."
TrueFilm,3dn2yp,qpzm333,3,Sat Jul 18 14:49:58 2015 UTC,"Some other Hungarian films worth checking out: Ferenc Kósa's Feldobott kő (The Upthrown Stone) and Tízezer nap (Ten Thousand Suns), András Kovács Hideg napok (Cold Days), Péter Bacsó A tanú (The Witness), Zoltán Fábri Az ötödik pecsét (The Fifth Seal) and Húsz óra (Twenty Hours), Ildikó Enyedi Az én XX. századom (My 20th Century), Zoltán Huszárik's Szindbád. I could go on and on but these are some great places to start. You won't see another film with such textured aesthetics as Szindbád and Az ötödik pecsét is about as morally complex as films get. Hungarain cinema is known for its parables and while most will champion Jancsó, the true master to me István Gaál. Gaál's Magasiskola is the perfect film to understand the paternalism of Hungary in the seventies"

He likes to keep things in black and white and hold shots absurdly and jawdroppingly long (Werckmeister is over 2 hours but is composed of only 39 shots, averaging 3.7 minutes per shot! And they're not stationary Ozu-esque shots either) His stories and themes are also quite enigmatic but they aren't the type that feels pretentious, rather they give off a mysterious vibe and keep you hooked. Don't expect an ordinary narrative structure.  I'm not sure how you can find his films apart from torrents. I'm sure someone else can answer that for you."

TrueFilm,3dn2yp,afewthoughtsonfilm,2,Sat Jul 18 06:37:17 2015 UTC,"Some additional things I would add about Tarr is that his films reward involvement and attention.  They move slowly and can sometimes take a while to fully develop everything that's going on but little things set up in the beginning can pay off many hours later into the film.  There's also lots of very slowly set up and subtle jokes in his films, so don't fall into the trap of thinking slow cinema = very serious cinema all the time.  I also find Satantango to be a lot easier to watch than most 3-4 hour epics, as long as you can set aside and appropriate chunk of time.  I think the hardest part is just deciding to watch it, but once you've committed to 7 hours of a very slow moving film, it becomes surprisingly absorbing, and its structured in a very pleasing way with each section lasting 1 hour and having narration and music at the end of each section."

What are some other films like this, where later prolific actors fill minor or supporting parts? Not like The Thin Red Line, which was billed as an ensemble film with established names, more like the case of Bryan Cranston who mostly appeared in made-for-televisions and scattered episodes of many different series before his cameo in Saving Private Ryan, or Paul Giamatti also in that movie who was just getting going in '98."

TrueFilm,3dm2c3,sdsachs,17,Fri Jul 17 11:00:17 2015 UTC,"Very in-depth write up. Good stuff.  I watched (or rewatched) the whole series before seeing Skyfall, and came away realizing I wasn't much of a Bond fan. The only films I truly like from the whole series include From Russia With Love, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The Living Daylights, GoldenEye, and Casino Royale.   The Living Daylights was such a refreshing change from Moore's cheesiness, but as the other poster mentioned, he was too ahead of his time. Dalton is such a fantastic actor. It's a real shame he only made 2 of these.  The last few Bonds seem to do this thing where they start off strong, refreshing the character, reinventing the mythology, and losing the accrued nonsense, but by the second film they're back at it again, and the same is true between Living Daylights and License to Kill. It's like the writers don't know where to take the character, and so instead of continuing down that path of reinvention they go back to what's familiar. It's a shame."
TrueFilm,3dm2c3,adrift98,9,Fri Jul 17 14:57:56 2015 UTC,"Heh.  What a funny takeaway.  I sort of find myself in a similar boat.  Taken individually, there's only a small handful of these films that I would actively sit down and watch for the pure sake of loving the film that much.  Even some of my favorites.  OHMSS was absolutely fantastic but outside the context of the series, I just don't know how many times I would actively pick it to sit down and watch by itself.  Most of these would only be remotely watchable if you're doing some sort of marathon.  That said, I do have this very strange obsession with sets and collections so I could definitely see watching the whole series every few years for kicks.    And as for the actors/writers developing a sort of repetition, it makes me wonder about the longevity of the series.  And I know that sounds silly.  The franchise is 50 years old -- clearly this can last.  But I mean... imagine the immense pressure each crew must feel when faced with the challenge of creating a new Bond movie that adheres to the previous traditions but is also fresh.  It's mind boggling how many new storylines can be developed -- though at their core, it's really only a handful of stories repurposed (as all films are, really).  I don't know how many different spy stories there could possibly be, but I guess I'll be excited to find out!"
TrueFilm,3dm2c3,DrunkDylanThomas,13,Fri Jul 17 17:36:12 2015 UTC,"Great write-up, keep them coming!  I've always loved The Living Daylights as an example to show people how Bond films reflect the times they were made in, and especially the change of 'enemies'.  It's fascinating to see how Bond becomes very good friends with an Afghani   Mujahideen (who of course is Oxford educated to make him a gentleman!) in order to beat those pesky Russians. How well would that play out today?   The fear of drugs becomes stronger as well, which will see more of a part in Licence to Kill as the 80's campaign against drugs continues.   All that aside, a great Bond film, and Dalton was simply too ahead of his time for a gritty Bond."
TrueFilm,3dm2c3,Alexanderzx360,5,Fri Jul 17 13:33:47 2015 UTC,"Nicely done, I waited the whole week for this review. After all the Moore movies (which I'm not that proud to say I liked) I found this one very good. The dark, gritty and back to the essentials Bond was perfectly portrayed by Dalton (something that I think won't be improved until Daniel Craig). I love the opening of this movie where they have you guessing which of them is really 007.  Licence to Kill is mixed between Bond fans, but let's see how you take that one."
TrueFilm,3dm2c3,snotbowst,4,Fri Jul 17 16:42:00 2015 UTC,"A lot of good stuff in here. And good timing too considering that I started watching all 23 again as well a few weeks ago (Thunderball is up next).  I think Dalton was a great way to right the ship after the relentless silliness of Moore.  He presents himself as someone who is cold and could kill anyone in the blink of an eye, but the audience can still tell he is a human being.  He has a little bit of anger and rage to him (something missing in the Moore films) which makes sense (and is necessary for a complete film I believe) as what assassin wouldn't have a bit of mean streak?  This just might be me, because I love moments like Dr. No's Smith & Wesson line, I believe it was For Your Eyes Only when Moore kicks the car off the cliff, Dalton tossing the suitcase off money at the guy over the shark tank in License to Kill (or the end with the death of the villain), and Brosnan's ""I'm just a professional doing a job.  Me too."" From Tomorrow Never Dies,  all the moments where Bond gives a kick to the guys when their down.  Really shows thay in the end he is a assassin by trade.  Overall though his two films sort of give me a case of blue balls.  I wish that he had another film after TLD that showed some personal setbacks explaining his foul mood in License to Kill, and then I wish that Dalton had been the one to be in Goldeneye, where he would come to terms with all of his violence in License to Kill and loss of usefulness is a post-Wall world."

TrueFilm,3dlu3c,lordhadri,9,Fri Jul 17 13:32:09 2015 UTC,Have and love both letterboxd and iCM. Letterboxd seems to be good for getting good suggestions (based on friends activity) on what to watch if I take a break from completing an iCM list. Here is my profile.

TrueFilm,3dlu3c,mimurph1,2,Fri Jul 17 13:30:12 2015 UTC,I see you have Inland Empire pinned up as one of your favourites. Consider yourself followed.
TrueFilm,3dlu3c,henrythebrown,2,Fri Jul 17 16:03:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I grew up in a small town, when I first moved to the ""big city"", I visited a small artsy fartsy theater for the first time to see a weekend showing of Inland Empire. It was the best movie experience I've ever had and each time I watch it, I get that feeling again like it's the first time in that small theater. Might not be the ""best"" movie, but definitely my favorite movie to watch."

TrueFilm,3dlu3c,onlinedavis,2,Sun Jul 19 00:22:53 2015 UTC,I wanted to try letterboxd but importing from imfb required buying a premium version or something. I have used icheckmovies for years which I am very satisfied with. Are there any pros/cons or notable differences which may make the purchase worth it?
TrueFilm,3dlu3c,chryzsh,4,Fri Jul 17 09:06:49 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Letterboxd Pro isn't entirely worth it, but just starting a free account where you log films you watch from now onward is certainly worth your time. Also, they make it incredibly easy to add films you have watched, you can just hover over a film you come across and click on the 'eye' to mark it watched, and one more click and you can rate it too."
TrueFilm,3dlu3c,chryzsh,2,Fri Jul 17 09:11:18 2015 UTC,"Sure, but when I have seen 2052 movies, checked on icm and rated on imdb, manually checking them at another site seems like such a drag.  Edit: Therefore, if letterboxd has something special which icm cant, I would consider buying pro."
TrueFilm,3dlu3c,chryzsh,4,Fri Jul 17 09:12:38 2015 UTC,"Letterboxd has a great feature called the Diary, where you log the films you see onto a calender of sorts. It really helps you keep track of when you saw them. In addition, its interface is truly spectacular. But these features help me, and I don't know if they do the same for you, so to each their own."
TrueFilm,3dlu3c,timmct93,3,Fri Jul 17 09:20:45 2015 UTC,"Seems pretty much like icm, except the interface is getting old and slow. But they are active again with a new beta so I got my hopes up  Edit: realized lbxd is only 20 usd a year so maybe I'll give it a shot!"
TrueFilm,3dlu3c,PostModernHobo,2,Fri Jul 17 09:28:13 2015 UTC,My profile.  I watch way too many movies.
TrueFilm,3dksck,bassgdae,27,Fri Jul 17 01:56:32 2015 UTC,"Influence, for one thing. We have rottentomatoes as a pastime but any individual critic has little sway over building an audience for a film, even a small one. Enough thinkpieces can sway how we think and talk about movies over time but probably wont influence how they get made as much.  I think one limiting factor is that the internet publishing model favors writing quickly and a lot, and while plenty of critics do this well, it doesn't give them a lot of space for the sort of researched, insightful essays we also need. Plenty of great film critics weren't all that great at immediate reviews of new movies.  The influence of the video essay is interesting, they have more potential than magazine journalism-style criticism does anymore. For example, RLM's Star Wars video essays are clearly a major influence on how the new movies are being made and presold to the fans."
TrueFilm,3dksck,lordhadri,27,Fri Jul 17 02:18:27 2015 UTC,"All these Youtube critics have one thing in common - they are using the films for relentless self promotion. It's never about the movie, it's always about THEM and they're dull, uninformed, shouty but worthless opinion."
TrueFilm,3dksck,D1r3ctor,23,Fri Jul 17 03:54:37 2015 UTC,"Every Frame a Painting is a notable exception I think you should consider, though that's made by a guy that's actually very interested in film and film history, and isn't about yelling into a camera to get his views out as fast as he possibly can.  Like you would never see something like his breakdown of Akira Kurosawa's visual style (Or Kurosawa's influence on the Star Wars movies) from someone like, say, Doug Walker."
TrueFilm,3dksck,Raxivace,17,Fri Jul 17 04:58:06 2015 UTC,"Tony's not a critic, he's a truly appreciative scholar."
TrueFilm,3dksck,D1r3ctor,5,Fri Jul 17 10:11:34 2015 UTC,"Its a nice distinction, but by making it we exclude the possibility of portraying youtube critics in a positive light."
TrueFilm,3dksck,Double-Down,7,Fri Jul 17 13:32:08 2015 UTC,But he isn't a critic - he doesn't review movies at all.
TrueFilm,3dksck,afewthoughtsonfilm,2,Sat Jul 18 00:15:29 2015 UTC,That's not generally considered a requirement?
TrueFilm,3dksck,lordhadri,3,Sat Jul 18 04:23:24 2015 UTC,"I suppose I was trying to draw a discrepancy between what he does versus what most others do.  He never poses any sort of evaluation of the films or filmmakers he discusses, but rather breaks down the elements that make them work.  Most others, including the ones listed here, focus their efforts on evaluating the merits - or lack thereof - of films, even when they are breaking them down (such as the popular reviews of, say, YMS).  You are right that he's a critic, but I guess in my head I colloquially associate that term with a film reviewer.  I do, however, believe there should be some distinction made between what he does and what most other channels do because they serve completely different ends."
TrueFilm,3dksck,afewthoughtsonfilm,4,Sat Jul 18 05:04:27 2015 UTC,"What makes him so exciting and more important than those others is that this is not what he does. Plenty of film scholars support their work by doing daily reviews for a publication. But it was never a requirement. It's especially not a requirement if you're in business for yourself on YouTube and don't need a publisher to have a platform. Lots of people do it anyway but they're just riding the cultural tide of new releases (and web traffic) whereas what Tony does really is video scholarship that's accessible to anyone. That's hard to pull off and so many who are already pro print critics have tried but haven't been as successful. Richard Brody has a video channel for example, but it doesn't really suit him I think."
TrueFilm,3dksck,lordhadri,13,Sat Jul 18 05:10:56 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ, this. So many Youtube ""reviewers"" of not just movies but games as well spouting their shallow and superficial opinions.  When I read real criticism or hell even posts on this subreddit, I always feel aware of how much there is to know about film that I didn't even know was out there for me to discover. This knowledge dwarfs me as a student but it enriches me as a film viewer.   The kind of reviewer you mention has never made me be glad for having checked out their work."
TrueFilm,3dksck,letominor,4,Fri Jul 17 09:48:56 2015 UTC,"Which is this this for? I don't think they are all that bad. Here's the following that I think it's true for:   Jeremy Jahns SchmoesKnow  FlickPick    Here's the following I don't think it's true for:   YMS  Doug Walker Chris Stuckmann (he is on RT as of recently)  What the Flick  (professional critics) PMI  (back when he used to do reviews)   What I think critics lack is talking about the movie itself. The only times critics talk about a movie in a balanced way is when they give it a 2/4, 5/10 etc because they view both sides of the movie. Anything higher they keep talking about the ""feeling"" they got and are incredibly nonspecific about why the movie is so good, and anything lower they blast the movie full on without mentioning any redeeming qualities. One thing I like about Stuckmann is that he often does little recaps at the end of his reviews to bring movies into perspective and justify his score. He is a YT persona kind of reviewer but he is one of the best."
TrueFilm,3dksck,TrumanB-12,9,Fri Jul 17 10:15:24 2015 UTC,"It's also definitely true of Walker and YMS. They will both give you something to think about sometimes but they're mostly about the upfront comedy of their reactions to movies. Also, neither of them really know film at all."
TrueFilm,3dksck,lordhadri,5,Fri Jul 17 13:28:00 2015 UTC,Why should we want critics to be balanced in their evaluation? Middling scores don't tell you what that critic thinks is worth watching.
TrueFilm,3dksck,lordhadri,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:40:43 2015 UTC,"I would agree that seems to be the case with most youtube critics, but Movies I Love (and so can you) and The Nerdwriter both offer insightful analysis on the films they examine."
TrueFilm,3dksck,DaGanzi,8,Sat Jul 18 01:23:04 2015 UTC,"With a lot of them, outside of certain exceptions like Mike and Jay from Half In The Bag and Tony Zhou and a few others, they lack any kind of developed knowledge of the history of the medium they're commenting on."
TrueFilm,3dksck,JeffBaugh2,4,Fri Jul 17 08:08:09 2015 UTC,"I hardly think RLM can be considered an exception.  They can be funny at times, but insightful or knowledgeable about film they are not."
TrueFilm,3dksck,afewthoughtsonfilm,4,Sat Jul 18 00:17:10 2015 UTC,"Jay at least does have some solid film knowledge, but I feel that, because RLM is humor first and foremost we don't often get deep and insightful critique of a film. I kinda miss Jay's quick cuts, and while they weren't super developed critiques, they were short reviews for films that wouldn't normally bring in big YouTube views. They also contained bits of constructive criticism and comparisons to other films and directors. Considering the videos were slapped together quick reviews, its a shame that the series didn't garner much popularity."
TrueFilm,3dksck,foxfact,-1,Sat Jul 18 02:56:51 2015 UTC,"I think watching any of the Plinkett reviews shows this not to be the case. And those are primarily the work of Mike, who's even less worldly than Jay as far as film goes."
TrueFilm,3dksck,JeffBaugh2,0,Sat Jul 18 07:56:38 2015 UTC,"The Plinkett reviews are a big part of what motivates this belief, actually.  Those reviews don't make insights on movies, they nitpick details of them.  They could maybe be interesting to someone whose trying to learn how to tell a story, but they are not analyses of films by any means.  I also think those reviews aren't very good either, but that's a personal belief."
TrueFilm,3dksck,afewthoughtsonfilm,3,Sat Jul 18 15:02:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe not what critics are lacking, but what they have an abundance of:  criticism of technical details and minor plot points.  Everyone loves to rag on any point in a movie that isn't bulletproof.  Also, so many people want to ""review"" a movie instead of criticize it.  They need a score or a like/dislike attached to it.  The ""review"" should discuss positives and negatives of the film, and bring up things a viewer may not have noticed or considered about the film, but at the end the viewer is left.to draw their own conclusions about whether they liked it or not.  Like, everyone shitting on the new Terminator movie.  Lots of talk about nitpicking or whatever, mostly downbeat reviews for it.  They all wanted me to believe that I would be absolutely miserable during it.  Ignored that, saw it anyways, and while I won't say it was great, or even good, I did have a fun time watching it.  Point being is that reviews wanted me to believe this was a five star restaurant serving sliders, but it actually turned out to be just a White Castle.  Tldr; reviews should pick your brain, not leash it."
TrueFilm,3dksck,snotbowst,7,Fri Jul 17 16:48:52 2015 UTC,"it seems part of the RT trend: everything needs a number which people can criticize or praise for being ""right"" instead of looking at the whys and whats of the review"
TrueFilm,3dksck,chicagofirefifa3,2,Fri Jul 17 18:58:24 2015 UTC,"That's a good point.  I think a lot of reviewers want to be ""right"" about the movie instead of saying what they actually think.  On top of that you've got people who want to be right now (i.e. public perception upon release), people who are contrarian now because they want to gamble on being seen as prophetic later on, and then people who are contrarian now just to antagonize people for hits/views/retweets/shares."
TrueFilm,3dksck,snotbowst,4,Fri Jul 17 19:12:46 2015 UTC,"It's not something lacking but I'd like to see more film criticism that eschews the usual reference to, consideration of, demonstrated knowledge about the business side of the movie (why it was made, is it successful, will it be successful) and mention of the personalities involved in its production (writer, director, actors). Unless they're really bad, don't even tell me the performances are good. Just take the film seriously as a work of (attempted) art that speaks entirely for itself. Focus on the sounds and images as a thing unto itself."
TrueFilm,3dksck,genebeam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:42:40 2015 UTC,"Criticism of the audience, listening.  Long-term test drives.  What does a film mean after you have watched it 20 times.  Not just opening night race to the marketing and advertising avalanche!"
TrueFilm,3dkan8,montypython22,7,Thu Jul 16 23:22:15 2015 UTC,"Dear /u/lordhadri,  For all her faults, I do think Aunt Pauline did her best stuff when she was writing about the New Hollywood pictures she loved and explaining what was good about them. When she’s attacking movies, she’s very unsuccessful because she wants to keep things as obtuse and unclear as possible in order to strengthen her (distorted) negative opinions on them. But when she’s talking about a New Hollywood film that made her feel a certain way, she’s on a roll. More than anything, the strengths in this piece lie in Kael’s ability to distinguish the characteristics about the New Hollywood auteurs that make them different from who came before them. To reiterate some of her observations that I find valid:   A lack of psychological explanations for characters’ motivations.   In the essay, she uses the example of Dog Day Afternoon and Lumet’s disinterest in explaining how Sonny is able to live in a heterosexual and homosexual relationship, but there are much more cogent examples in other works of New Hollywood. You have A Woman Under the Influence—where the mental affliction of the Gena Rowlands character and how a mental asylum affects her are never explained; you have Nashville, where the motivations for Kenny’s assassination of the country singer are never given; you have The Godfather Part II, whose ending leaves the psychological disintegration of Michael Corleone in a state of imbalance; and so on and so on. The auteurs I’ve listed—Cassavetes, Altman, and Coppola, respectively—distinguish their works from what came before them because they are not interested in explaining the “why” of a situation. They are interested in how this situation affects the main players. Hitchcock would have played A Woman Under the Influence differently for an American audience in 1964; we can compare Marnie, for instance, which tantalizes the audience with many would-be-explanations for the Tippi Hedren character’s mental illnesses, until Hitchcock, acting as a god-like figure, explains the whole movie in its final 10 minutes. A New Hollywood auteur like Cassavetes, on the other hand, bypasses the god-like position altogether, and is more akin to a fly-on-the-wall observing patterns of human behavior and leaving possible interpretations in the audience’s mind. The New Hollywood auteurs, as Kael observes, play on the fact that the individual can’t know everything about a person, and so they direct their pictures as if they were a surrogate for the audience: knowing nothing, feeling their way through a movie, unsure of the outcome at the beginning and at the end. And what I find so fascinating about Kael’s section on Dog Day Afternoon in general is that she says that it’s the audience who is asking for these sort of pictures. American moviegoers in the 70s directly responded to this type of movie more because tastes had changed. Kael calls it a maturity on the audience-member, as she says in this passage:   “We like the diversion of surprising behavior in movies; we don’t respond to those Charlton Heston heroes who lack irrational impulses. And we don’t want over-elaborated motivation—we want just enough for us to get the sense of what a person is about.”   Anybody who is bred on Hollywood pictures of the studio-era will obviously want the director to explain themselves: to explain why Nashville ends the way it does, or why we never learn about Mabel’s experience in the mental asylum in A Woman Under the Influence, or whether there is a bug or not in Gene Hackman’s apartment in The Conversation. They’ll all criticize the director for not knowing his own movie, when in fact it is purposefully ambiguous for good reason. There’s a reason why New Hollywood was considered a “maturing-up” of American filmmaking.   The stigma against sexuality in Hollywood   Kael’s acknowledgment that audiences are more mature than Hollywood gives them credit is at the heart of this piece. I think her complaints against studios for not providing enough mature material for audiences to handle are as valid today as they were in 1976. She even rails against Hollywood’s Puritanical prudishness in this section near the end of her Man Who Fell From Earth diatribe:   Two human beings who are sexually and emotionally involved cause pain to each other, and it takes more skill than most writers and directors have to deal with that pain. Besides, with the Supreme Court decision leaving the determination of what is pornography to the communities, almost any treatment of the psychology of sex may get a film into serious legal problems…Porno films are all over the place, so it looks as if the screen is wide-open, but actually the studios aren’t taking chances on sexual themes.   It’s the reason why studios refused to gamble with something as erotically charged as Showgirls: they think their audiences will cause a fuss and boycott it because of its ostensibly pornographic outlook. They’re essentially saying, “We don’t think this stuff is mature enough for you to handle, so we won’t make it.” And, in an essence, directors who try this stuff (and fail) are proving them right. As Kael says, it’s very hard to do the serious erotic drama right, and while this stuff was much more challenging in the 1970s (with movies like Bertolucci’s Last Tango In Paris, Oshima’s In the Realm of the Senses, and Roeg’s Don’t Look Now earning international and domestic success in spite of, or rather because of their hyper-sexual content), nowadays you try to make an erotic drama and it’s very easy to descend into artsy ennui and banality. And even the occasionally triumphant sexual pictures which DO make it big on the international scene (like Young and Innocent or Blue is the Warmest Color) are dead across the pond, only appealing to a small niche of dedicated foreign-cinema-viewers. And if Hollywood’s idea of giving crumbs to sexually starved masses is Fifty Shades of Grey, then it’ll be a looooong time before Kael is vindicated and we can start again making some actually popular, actually great sexually-explicit dramas in this country."
TrueFilm,3dkan8,lordhadri,3,Thu Jul 16 23:23:21 2015 UTC,"Dear /u/montypython22:  Is this essay where the quote about Spielberg and the proscenium arch originates from? I do understand what that's supposed to say about Spielberg's style but seeing it come from a Kael essay makes me trust it less. It's either hearsay or overstated; I'm sure we can find some proto-Spielbergs in cinema history even though there's a pretty clear 'before' Spielberg' and 'after' Spielberg where so much is an imitation of him.  And how odd is it to see him written of as a 'young director?'  Does her blurb about Jack Nicholson make any sense? I just rewatched Chinatown yesterday and it sounds like what she's talking about but doesn't give me any insight as to how a Nicholsonian character is different from heroes that came before, or since the essay.  It's interesting to see Kael describe a time when Americans would have to 'escape' to foreign imports; if that was ever very common outside of New York City it doesn't seem to be common anywhere now. Now  a smaller number of us have to escape to something like The Tribe to feel diversified. Must've been a bit better when Bergman and Fellini were doing steady work.  As to erotic 1970s film, don't forget Turkish Delight! I think there is a flip side to this that, because erotic movies are forbidden, when something like Nymphomaniac does get made, it's all the rage in art circles. Given its reputation for being a hard-to-do subject though, I'm ok with commercial films not bothering. It would be enough if they restored any sexuality at all to the lives of their characters. The tyranny of PG-13 means the main characters aren't even macho badasses anymore but are starting to just be unaware manchildren, like the audience."
TrueFilm,3dkan8,lordhadri,3,Fri Jul 17 03:02:33 2015 UTC,"And how odd is it to see him written of as a 'young director?'   I don't think she's writing him off. If anything, she categorizes him with the other New Hollywood mavericks (Altman, Scorsese, De Palma) to whom aesthetic morality takes precedence before any other kind of morality.  Also, can we talk about that sweeping, almost stereotypical generalization of Catholics in regards to Scorsese, Altman, et. al? It's borderline parodic, saying that because they somehow grew up Catholic, they can feel more savage emotions. I've read interviews with Scorsese and his Catholic upbringing definitely has a connection with his cinema (as is evident in the church scenes in Mean Streets), but still.....very iffy observation on Kael's part.   Does her blurb about Jack Nicholson make any sense?   Well, from the Nicholsons I've seen from this period, I would say it makes some sense. In Easy Rider, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and The Last Detail (where he plays the awesomely-named Badass Budusky), he's a really devilish imp who seems to be joking at all times and is never foolish enough to take what he does seriously. But at the same time, Kael doesn't take into account Nicholson's obvious masculinity and his subtle suave charm, which DOES put him in a pantheon of seductive leading men before that, so I dunno what she's getting at there.  Kael would flip her wig if she saw The Tribe today; it's the kind of pseudo-artistic trash that she warned us of in ""Trash, Art, and the Movies."""

So her use of it here bugged me too. It's like taking psychoanalysis too far. And we do it in other spheres to like when we point out that all Supreme Court Justices are Jewish or Catholic, or talk about the influence of the Protestant Work Ethic on American capitalism and so forth. So perhaps there's something to it with the movies. Still, it draws a circle around an artist and limits our ability to understand what they do. I think it's just one of those things writers fall into where they need adjectives to describe what they're seeing, but unless someone is breaking down the influences of Catholicsm in Scorsese's work, it comes off like it does here, a distracting epithet."

TrueFilm,3dibrb,bulcmlifeurt,6,Fri Jul 17 18:03:25 2015 UTC,"Here's my semi-official response to some of the things being said in this thread.  We have nothing against recommendations. Recommending things to watch is normal cinephile behavior and we all love doing it. The issue is really with how reddit works. On /r/movies there are always lots of recommendation requests, they usually aren't very interesting, and the top-rated response is usually some sacred movie that most people watch anyway. For example in a thread asking for the best war movies, the person who says Saving Private Ryan and Paths of Glory will get the most approval. The upvote/downvote system doesn't benefit people who have seen more stuff than most people and can give great, unusual answers to recommendation threads. I do not think it will work any differently here, so to keep ourselves differentiated from /r/movies, we don't allow them.  While a scheduled megathread is one of those things that sounds like a good idea to all of us in theory I also have this suspicion that it won't work. This subreddit isn't really big enough to sustain it, the way you're describing. Maybe we could do something more like a public 'ask the mods' thread every once in awhile and of course anyone else who wanted to participate would be welcome. I'll think about it some more.  Television won't be allowed. The way the popular TV shows these days are talked about is too different from movies, and is a poor fit for TrueFilm. I know how hard it is to get something similar to TrueFilm for TV going because I'm also a mod of /r/trueseries. To be clear I don't mind if people talk about the role of TV or how what movies do compares to what TV is doing, it'd just be threads about actual TV shows that are considered off-topic.  Our rules are more lenient than /r/movies rules. A lot of this is because so much of our community posts is good faith, (Thank you.) We delete a lot of threads because we want users to make a moderate effort and to be unique voices. There are certain types of threads that are popular on reddit (change my view, state your unpopular opinions, recommendations, etc.) that get repetitive and obscure threadsthat are more interesting. But the bar is really a pretty low one."
TrueFilm,3dibrb,svene,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:48:13 2015 UTC,"My only problem with recommendation threads is that people like talking about movies they are aware of. So threads like ""Id like to recommend Taxi Driver... again"" will get more upvotes and comments than ""I'd like to recommend Madchen in Uniform"". Not because any of those who comment are lowbrow plebians (while I love both films, Taxi Driver is one of my few 10/10 films), but just because if a person has something to add to the discussion, they will, and more people have seen Taxi Driver than have seen Madchen in Uniform.  Perhaps a ""recommend a little known movie"" day instead, where the imdb page of the submitted movie must have less than 5000 votes or something. Because, if you just kill that ""awareness"" element of recommendation threads, I feel that they are actually quite helpful and interesting."

We could allow the threads and heavily police the content in order to keep the quality of posts high, but this would require a lot of effort on the part of the mods, and it's essentially a losing battle. The dynamic of reddit upvotes will typically reward the most base-level, universally appealing content.  I would contend that the simplest solution (although it's not perfect) is to ban the threads outright. Honestly it would be great it we could have those types of threads here, but in my experience they all turn to shit pretty quickly and degrade the overall quality and posting standard within the sub.

TrueFilm,3dkgob,Mr_Mu,3,Fri Jul 17 00:13:26 2015 UTC,"That's certainly an interesting perspective and is supported a little by the appearance of the Majola Snake, which is also sort of magical/surreal/symbolic. I don't really buy into it though, considering Val has a presence and is considered by other characters throughout the film. Your interpretation is spot-on thematically though: Val definitely represents a younger counterpart of Maria's struggle, a new and uncomfortable understanding of the way things are in showbiz today that Maria has trouble coming to terms with. Instead of Val being revealed as a figment of Maria's inner struggle, I think her disappearance just implies the ultimate breaking point of their relationship, where Val couldn't stand Maria's stubborn ways and just had to leave, causing Maria to actually consider and adopt some of Val's views and become more open to the 'young generation' as you said (sci-fi movie, finally accepting her role as the older woman in the play). So yeah, pretty much identical thematic logic (clash and eventual joining of young/old perspectives). Also, not to shoot down your interpretation (perfectly valid so long as you're keen on it), and I may be wrong, but I thought there was a shot of Val sitting by a building up in the hills just after she runs away.  I never really got my head around the Majola Snake on my own, but I've read others interpret it as loosely symbolic of the rare, 'flash in the pan' nature of inspiration/fame/stardom, which makes the most sense. Just like the Majola Snake, inspiration/fame comes and goes very quickly and unpredictably. E.g. how Maria's moment of fame came and went quickly with the original run of the Majola Snake play, and how it came back at the end of the film with the return of the Majola Snake (both the phenomenon and the play).   Also, I think a big idea is that these flashes of fame are rare and far inbetween, and people can be left disillusioned with themselves/their career after it passes, or can be forever in the shadow of their previous fame (think 'washed out' actors who cling to their previous fame, such as Maria to an extent). The Majola Snake, a flash of magic, inspired Wilhelm (guy who wrote the play) to build the rest of his career around it, with his Majola Snake play as his most famous/defining moment, and Maria seems pretty indifferent/unhappy with her career other than her initial flash of fame with her role in Majola Snake.   I hope I wrote that all out about the Majola Snake in a way that makes sense! Pretty great movie I thought, very thematically consistent/clear and super satisfying to figure out, was also surprised when I found next to no discussion online."
TrueFilm,3dkgob,yewyewyew,2,Fri Jul 17 12:38:59 2015 UTC,"I don't personally know how to interpret it, but I suspect very strongly that the key to understanding it is their earlier conversation about the suicide in Majola Snake.  Maria points out it isn't an obvious suicide: the character simply goes for a hike and vanishes.  This is exactly what happens to Val shortly after.  Now that's pretty obvious, but I feel it needs to be pointed out."
TrueFilm,3dj8l5,CaptainSoban,10,Thu Jul 16 18:37:47 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of such a framework for film, although I must say a great deal of this applies to film as well:     Film most certainly fits into the sensation category, as many films (I'll cite Godard's Goodbye to Language as a recent example) take advantage of sight and sound to make for some really fascinating experiences.   Fantasy also fits with film, as escapism was and still is a large part of the allure of films for many people.   Narrative fits too, for obvious reasons.   I would argue that Fellowship is also a label that can be shared with film.  Although many experiences are best had in private (I, for one, prefer to experience a film like What Time is it There? alone so that I privately experience emotional catharsis), many films - particularly comedies - are best shared in a group.  I would never say film has to be a social experience, but I'm sure many would agree that the social experience is part of what makes film special. I'm not entirely sure what is meant by the discovery description, though I would argue that film deals with a great deal of discovery: discovery about the world, about the human condition, about self, etc. Submission quite obviously fits for the same reasons as fantasy: for the escapism quality.   Additionally, I would also add two others: emotional and intellectual.    For me, at least, one of the great pleasures of film is the ability it has to emotionally move me.  Part of the brilliance of Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy is the way in which he draws a great deal of emotion out of the experiences of his characters; there are many tears to be had in his films.  Likewise, Make Way for Tomorrow is one of those devastating experiences that everyone should go through at least once.  However, I would also give a lot of credence to the intellectual level of film as well.  What makes Malick one of the most important filmmakers of the contemporary era are the philosophical questions he asks with his films.  He explores a great deal about life and what it means, which makes his films very worthwhile.  Béla Tarr does the same in his films as well.  Now, all of this said, I do want to address one thing:    This framework is a really useful tool in analyzing whether or not a particular game achieves what it sets out to do.   I hesitate of applying such a metric to film and here's why: plenty of films set extremely low standards for themselves, but meeting those standards does not equate to being a good film.  Sharknado wants to be the worst movie ever made, so they choose to do everything poorly.  I suppose they succeeded in that, but that is not to suggest that it's a great movie (hell, it isn't even the best worst movie; Troll 2, Birdemic, and Theodore Rex blow it way out of the water).  Lowbrow comedies can achieve their goals fairly easy, but that doesn't make their success equivalent to the success of a much smarter comedy.  And when it comes to harder-to-analyze films, how does ease of understanding play a role?  Apichatpong Weerasethakul is one of the most challenging filmmakers around right now; his films are slow and his ideas not easily accessed.  Yet, does that make him worse because his films aren't as easily accessible as someone like Michael Haneke, who is far easier to understand?    I guess my point is that trying to evaluate whether a movie met its goals is not a very good way of measure the quality of a film.  Like any art form, there are so many different avenues that one can approach making a film, so it seems wrong to try to create a simple metric to evaluate them.  I dunno, maybe that's just me."

For one, that there is a single reason, or set of reasons, that compel all people to watch all movies. I don't think that's the case.  Even with a list like the one you provided, there's surely many films throughout history that don't fit into either of those categories, or fit into more than one. Single films can have elements of all of those things you listed, or none of them.  I like to revert back to Wittgenstein's writings on games and language-games in these kinds of discussions because, all these years later, it's still so relevant. In short, he compares using a language to playing a game — a conversation is two people making a series of ""moves"". Wittgenstein draws a comparison between a single words different uses, to all the different kinds of games there are: card games, board games, sport games, team games, singular games, competitive games, drinking games, video games, etc., etc. He then asks us what essential thing, if any, exists between them all that makes them all games. The answer is that there is none (and yet, we feel the need to look for it). Rather, there is a network of complex, interconnected, family resemblances between them. Many games share qualities with others, and some don't have any similarities at all (yet they're still considered games).  I've digressed. But in short, my point is that there isn't any single essential element, or set of elements, to all films and film-viewers that could reveal to us the answer to such a question. There isn't one reason why people watch films. But there are, I'm sure, many complicated, interconnected, networks of similarities between people and films and the reason that they watch them."

The bigger concern for me would be longevity, because in just a few years time the intended audience will be in exactly the same position as, in your case, the Polish audience.    I think it's a big failing in McFarlane's comedy.  I still love the first few seasons of Family Guy.  It started during my final year of school and despite not being American the references were generally familiar to me.  But sixteen years later I can't really watch contemporary episodes.  You could argue that the quality has dipped but what it comes down to is that I frequently haven't got a clue what they're talking about because i'm no longer immersed in the pop culture that the humour is reliant on.

TrueFilm,3dghkj,Lucarxo,9,Thu Jul 16 07:24:24 2015 UTC,"Ireland tends to have its finger on the pulse of American culture though, perhaps through sharing a language.  Arguably the majority of content consumed by young Irish people is either American or British, with Irish coming in a close third.    As I said though, I don't think familiarity is the problem but rather longevity.  In five years time contemporary audiences will lose interest if comedy relies so heavily on pop culture references.  In ten years time the bulk of a film's comedy simply won't make any sense.  When you say distributors or people are at fault, do you mean in how the film is marketed?"
TrueFilm,3dghkj,thesmilingmeat,2,Thu Jul 16 07:37:21 2015 UTC,"Not so much how it's marketed, but that a country like India, mentioned in here already, who are very conservative towards sex jokes, for example, have no real business showing this as a blockbuster. I don't believe in banning a movie from a country, or anything like that, I just don't understand how the distributors would think showing this kind of movie there would work.   The same can be said for other countries.   You can also wonder why people would go to see this without seeing the first one, or even without knowing McFarlane's previous works. This is mainly aimed at those foreign countries. Sure, some people there may be familiar with his works and the references, but a theatre full of people who don't?   The comedy may end up dated, or unfunny to younger people in years to come. Clearly it already has in some corners of the world."

When there was a cameo, a random person in the audience would yell out what the person was famous for. (ie Back to the Future!) Only the physical comedy drew any audible guffaw for the entire film.

Thus, I gained enough cultural insight to still be able to get many references that my countrymen do not - which is very evident when I watch for example The Daily Show with friends. I have since coming home tried to stay on top of the cultural shifts in the USA, but I still find some references go over my head as well. Well, recently I have met this wonderful woman from a Baltic country, who has almost zero knowledge of such cultural references. She has maybe watched one Disney movie in her entire life, to put it into perspective. This is actually good for me. Beforehand, in lazy attempts at humor, I would throw around references like there was no tomorrow - and many would fall flat because most of my countrymen cannot reasonably be expected to be well versed in american commercials, and people actually born in the Soviet Union can with even less reason be expected to know such trivial things. My point is just that as a consequence hereof, I have to really think hard about what I want to say and how. I simply cannot use an offhand reference to whatever pop cultural phenomenon from the USA because my SO simply doesn't understand. This has made me a much more eloquent man, for if I want to make her laugh, I actually have to say something funny, rather than rely on beaten down movie quotes or the likes. I think the same lesson could be beneficial for people such as Mr. MacFarlane (whom I am not a fan of in any way, it must be said) and the general populace of Reddit. As a final note, if an interpreter is really worth their salt, they will find ways to translate the references to suit the relevant culture the film is being shown in - The Daily Show is usually very well translated into my native language, which gives me much joy, as I now can laugh with John directly, and then again when I read how he is translated."
TrueFilm,3dghkj,PeterKien,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:24:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's fair to make the assumption that Seth McFarlane is somehow incapable of humor that doesn't rely on reference.  He's clearly a very funny person, he just writes a television show (and nearly identical set of films) with a particular appeal to them.  Remember, the logo of the show is a television set - it was always meant as a satire on American television, so it seems to me an unfair thing to skewer him for.  As far as reddit goes, the reason you see references so often is party that they're easy, but mostly that they get upvoted because people tend to vote for recognition.  An actually clever thought might get some love ,but how often do you see ""Upvoted because Adventure Time"" as a response?"
TrueFilm,3dghkj,snoharm,4,Thu Jul 16 19:31:17 2015 UTC,"You are right, and I agree it is a bit arrogant of me to presume to give advice to Mr. MacFarlane. I would never say he is incapable of humor, and I have respect for him as an entertainer, but I would love to see him try his hand at some less shallow material, not unlike what Sacha Baron Cohen or Larry David is doing, which I think is very interesting. I probably dislike Mr. MacFarlane's humor to a degree, not only because I see this reference based way of talking in the general public, but also in myself, which I began to detest, because it sometimes stands in the way of original thought I feel. So I'm kinda projecting a bit of my own self loathing, unfairly, on to Mr. MacFarlane. My apologies.  I also agree with what another poster said, and don't have a problem with this approach to humor as such, but I still would rather throw my money at something a bit more timeless in it's attitude. I remember reading a play by Aristophanes some years ago and marveled at how funny, fresh and current it seemed, thanks to a good translator of course, and wonder where the Aristophanes of today are to be found - I'm sure they are out there, but I'm also sure Mr. MacFarlane is no Aristophanes. Maybe that is not a bad thing, but I'm sure he is capable of a more sophisticated but also less lucrative style of humor. Monetary success seems like a poor way overall of gauging someones career."
TrueFilm,3dghkj,PeterKien,2,Thu Jul 16 22:06:16 2015 UTC,You're making the mistake of comparing completely different styles and works side-by-side.

Both have value.
TrueFilm,3dghkj,snoharm,2,Thu Jul 16 22:13:07 2015 UTC,"I hope it doesn't seem like I don't think MacFarlane's humor has value, that was not my intention at least. I agree with your assessment of what he attempts, but in my view he contributes to the absurdity rather than captures it, but the world is not worse off because of that! Maybe it is indeed unfair to compare him to playwrights such as Aristophanes, maybe a more apt comparison would be Matt Groening or even Dave Chappelle, besides Mel Brooks. I'm not sure what such a comparison yields, however, and admit my own shortcomings at attempting one."

The goal is to make people laugh and they do so by implementing a particular brand of referential humour, sacrificing longevity in the process.

Frankly, any argument in that context to the contrary is inherently pretentious.  Deciding which films and which films are ""valid"" uses of the medium is fairly pretentious.  Edit: Is it not?

Its a non-stop reference fest and I'm sure most Americans aren't even picking up on most of them."
TrueFilm,3dghkj,RogerDeanVenture,3,Thu Jul 16 08:49:49 2015 UTC,"In the comedy world, they say ""Comedy doesn't transcend language."" But, I think it's bigger than that, I believe comedy doesn't stand end culture. Unfortunately, references are one of the three major tools of comedy (physical (prat falls), situational (after a break up, eating ice cream, ""it tastes like cherry and rejection""), and referential). Referential comedy covers a wide array of word play, malapropism, and other tools that can use more than just cultural references, but it explains why many Americans ""just don't like British humor."" Because approximately 1/3rd of all jokes either reference culture or language. Both of which differ even in similar cultures, which is shown by stand-up comedians who are on the road who ask questions like ""what's the biggest mall here?"" and plug that information into a joke about the mall. (Dane Cooks opener in Harmful if Swallowed is about a mall parking garage in LA despite living in Boston at the time.) So, some cultural references don't even cross state lines.   What this all means is that Comedy usually plays best in its home market. Ted (the first one) grossed $247 mil in the U.S. opening weekend, and totaled $269 mil world wide. In total Ted pulled in about $500. That's not to say it's an inferior film to Transformers: Age of Extinction (which pulled in $1 Bil). In fact, I'd argue that it's far superior because it more tapped into the zeitgeist, which is why it's the highest grossing comedy of all time). However, this means that at least 1/3rd of the humor won't work in China, which is why they'll never enjoy it. I'd be willing to bet that most of the international box office is due to a mix of advertising hype, and American expats.   Now, comedies earn half as much as equivalent blockbusters, which is why they have smaller budgets (although it's not one to one). I'd also bet that the bulk of the marketing budget on a big budget comedy goes to just US advertising. I'd like to think we, in this sub, know how complex the film industry is. And, I trust that execs know how to make their money back on any film.   Some like to mock films with referential humor (or referential comedy in general), and that's because when done poorly, it doesn't age well. But, referential humor can be great if done well (George Carlin's joke on Shell Shock/Battle Fatigue/Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). I don't think Ted 2 will age very well (but then again technology is changing so quickly neither will many dramas), but it's still a good film that, to Seth McFarland's credit, taps into the zeitgeist very well (Comicon and gay rights? Nothing bigger in the U.S. right now.)."
TrueFilm,3dghkj,robmox,3,Thu Jul 16 10:59:46 2015 UTC,"I personally find works that rely heavily on very specific cultural references an indication of lack of creative thinking; I've done this often when I get stumped, and when I review it later it feels very self-absorbed and lazy. I have no problem with specific cultural references in and of itself, but the treatment and execution of it needs to surpass its own context in order to convey a part of a bigger theme. Great comedians are able to achieve that."

My friends and I knew so much about the culture of the US that, even if one of the name mentioned didn't ring a bell, we'd be able to grasp the joke just by the content and punchline. My Czech wife however, was raised during the Communist occupation and very few US shows were screened during her upbringing so this prevents her from getting many of the references to 80s/ 90s celebrities, politicians and events."
TrueFilm,3dghkj,SirPlus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:51:56 2015 UTC,"I enjoy references in comedy, even the cheap, bad ones.  Not only do they show us what people of the time enjoyed, they also work as a reminder, keeping the interesting bits of the past alive for future audiences.    However, we have such an expanse of pop culture these days, much of it ephemeral and easily forgotten.  Will people in 2070 appreciate it when they see Stewie parodying that grape crushing video?  I doubt it.  So why does that not work but a fish that looks like Peter Lorre seems to hold up fine?  The former is just a cheap gag and it's not really funny if you don't get the reference.  The Peter Lorre fish works because you don't need to know the reference, you'll laugh because there's nothing else you can do when looking at a face that's so weird and unsettling."
TrueFilm,3dghkj,BRODUS,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:58:20 2015 UTC,"I was very surprised to find that I actually liked the movie (most of it).   First of all, unlike A million ways to die in the west, it was much funnier - and yes, a few jokes contained references but I don't think the humor was ruined for it - and it also contained many reference-free jokes, or at least jokes many people outside the US could get. There undoubtedly was a mixture of family guy type of jokes, but that's just his style of comedy, and there is nothing you can do about that.   I particularly loved certain subtle things that MacFarlane did with the story, that distanced the movie from a lot of the ""Cliches of the Genre."" One thing that comes to mind right now is the guitar scene, where they sleep outside and Sam is playing a song on the guitar. Normally in a movie like this you have the guy play the guitar (there were a few of these little things broke the taboo and I really liked).   I also enjoyed the premise of the story, which I thought to be original, and unlike many of the criticisms that the film received, I don't think it exploited the success of the first one, at least not in premise. The main thing that was taken from the original TED  were the characters of course, and the amazing chemistry between John and Ted - from then on, this was it's own story, and it was allowed to develop independently.   What ruined the movie for me, and I mean RUINED, was the ending. It was almost identical to the first one, from the moment Ted and John have that fight outside of comic-con or something (so basically the last 20% of the film). That was just ""Hey, we don't know how to end this, let's make it like the first one but reverse roles!""  Very, very disappointing!"

Not sure how saying Poles in a Polish theater not laughing at a movie that was 75% American 80s references is condescending.   As an American living in Poland, the same is for me. A lot of things on Polish tv fly right over my head, even though I've lived and studied here for years.  This post was mainly talking about how a movie can get a packed theater full of moviegoers, yet over half of the time there's silence.  I don't think it's condescending to point out that all of the Poles I asked afterward said they've never seen the Tick live action tv show, let alone know that it was Patrick Warburton. And how it's an interesting experience to be in a theater of hundreds and be the only person laughing at that sight.

TrueFilm,3dhoqh,Dark1000,2,Thu Jul 16 10:36:20 2015 UTC,"What I would suggest is to read a lot ABOUT Almodovar and read some criticisms of him.  I think his later work, including Volver, is really good, and some of his early stuff too, like Atame.  He is one of the most interesting thinkers about sex and gender.  It's been a really long time since I saw Volver, but a lot of what you pick up on are exactly the type of details Almodovar is most focused on.    I think the biggest problem is cultural: Almodovar is satirizing aspects of gender and sexuality that have yet to become foddder for satire here: as a zeitgeist, we haven't dealt with all these issues as extensively as Spain's has.  But it's starting to happen, obviously.  A lot of the time he will satirize sexual norms that in America we haven't really addressed enough to think about as sexual norms. It's just a slightly different cultural dialogue. Each one of the points you bring up could lead to a huge discussion of gender and what Almodovar is trying to say.  There's a certain amount of symbolism, but most of it is pretty open for interpretation.  Also, Almodovar makes a lot of references to gay cinema, within which he doesn't really want his movies to fall, but which he alludes to a lot.  There's a lot going on in Almodovar, he's drawing from a unique set of references.  Finally, the tone of Almodovar is always disturbing.  Even when it's campy for the whole film (those are not my favorite of his films) the main emotional beat is going to be something really disturbing and jarring with the campy tone.  That's kind of how you have to walk into his films: everything's gonna seem really playful until it starts to really disturb you. This is actually fairly common in Spanish/Latin American film. You enjoy his films, but they always make you a little bit queasy, even the funniest ones, like Atame.   I remember thinking Volver was a pretty good introduction to Almodovar.  But Broken Embraces is probably better. I think that could be a good point of introduction from a cinephile's perspective, as it addresses the artistic process in detail, specifically with regard to film.  Then I think Talk to Her is probably the best one, and gives you the most complete picture those issues that he focuses on most throughout his work. Atame is just as crazy as the others, or almost, and is aimed at a wider audience perhaps unfamiliar with his other work (it's one of his earliest films and made Antonio Banderas a star). But I find him to be one of the most consistent writer-directors living: the only films of his I didn't really enjoy were Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown and All About My Mother."
TrueFilm,3dhoqh,permanent_red,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:01:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. For me, the tonal dissonance was what really blindsided me. I know that Almodovar often deals with taboo subject matter, but I didn't expect it once the subject matter and lighter tone seemed to have already been established. It was really jarring."
TrueFilm,3dhoqh,-00Ghost27,2,Fri Jul 17 09:39:20 2015 UTC,"This is a question I regularly think about when I watch Pedro Almodóvar's films. I've watched many of them and I always wonder how I would feel about them if I was not born where I was. His entire cinematography is filled with this very Mediterranean vibe that is the essence of all the life and events of his films. What if I was born in Norway? Or in the US? I would only be able to evaluate the film based on the predictable and formal aspects of it. The quirkiness of Almodóvar's characters, his strong female protagonists and other characteristics demand a specific approach that I understand many wouldn't take.   I wish I could discuss the events of this film more,but the last time I saw it was 4 years ago. I think the lack of suspense you mention and the seemingly unjustifiable decisions some characters make are part of Almodóvar's style, with all the rambling and the self-indulgent attitude.  If you feel you have to give him another chance, go for Todo Sobre Mi Madre (All About My Mother) or La Piel Que Habito (The Skin I Live In). Just don't expect the tightness and tidiness of the better screenplays of american thrillers or dramas. Just go with it."
TrueFilm,3dhoqh,poliphilo,2,Thu Jul 16 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"This was my 8th (approximately) Almodóvar film, and I'm in great agreement with your comments; the movie doesn't work.  I'm overall quite a fan of him as a filmmaker. One of his repeated strategies is to suggest provocative and controversial positions (e.g. sympathy for rapists, women objectifiers, sexual abusers), but to offset it tonally—e.g. setting it in a usually pleasant world of fun, nice decor, attractive people, lots of art, food, an overall atmosphere of warm compassion (despite some periodic dark clouds). So it doesn't come off anything like Catherine Breillat or Gaspar Noe or Larry Clark, even though there are some real connections. His interesting pacing (scenes that play slow, scenes that seem to do no work) sometimes amazingly bridges the gaps between the dissonant elements.  The thing is, on some of his films, the elements just don't come together. The emotional dissonances don't synthesize with other elements of the film enough to gesture towards some kind of deeper meaning. In the case of Volver, the weirdness of that Raimunda burying scene seems intentional to me, but the rest of the movie didn't help me make sense of or enjoy the disjunctions. I also felt (and think you might have felt) that many of the scenes hint at something darker (is Raimunda a sociopath? a cannibal?), something that never arrives.  I think Volver, despite its charms, is probably the least successful of Almodóvar's movies, and I suspect its awards are in part due to good will for his prior work and for Cruz. Broken Embraces is less tonally odd, but I think ultimately suffers the same ""lack of vitality"" you describe. I suggest his masterpiece, All About my Mother very much, followed by Live Flesh and Atame! (Time Me Up! Time Me Down!)."
TrueFilm,3dhoqh,TheyShootFilmDntThey,2,Thu Jul 16 23:12:46 2015 UTC,"I think you've articulated my reservations about the film. The emotional dissonance between the lighter elements and darker, more taboo, subject matter, don't quite connect. Perhaps part of it is how meshing them together felt so unexpected. Tone is really important to me as a viewer, and the very bright, pleasant, foodie-movie atmosphere, with coldness running underneath, threw me off when paired with the darker events.  You're spot on regarding a background darkness to Raimunda's characterization, but it never comes to the foreground or develops, even into what I would call uneasiness. She's not very generous with people or giving them the slightest amount of time, yet she's perfectly at ease ordering up the materials to hide the body. The combination of a corpse in the freezer and her instantaneous conversion to successful restaurateur is very suggestive, but it doesn't seem to go anywhere. It almost felt like a forgotten, loose thread, though I'm sure it was not."
TrueFilm,3defok,The-Doctor-94,27,Wed Jul 15 17:03:30 2015 UTC,"I think there's a place for both. Great movies have incorporated both realistic and stylized dialogue well, and they work in different ways. The Before trilogy (or really any of Richard Linklater's work) comes into mind as some of the most realistic dialogue in the history of cinema. It's sooo on point, and the actors do such a good job delivering it, that it truly sounds like improvisation, as though they are truly two people talking to each other. I think a lot of people actually think it is all improvised. It's wonderful.  On the other end of the spectrum, movies like The Social Network or In Bruges have such a witty sense of self to them, that it's just so FUN to listen to, and it draws you in arguably more so than more ""realistic"" writing. Movies are fantasies, and I think when the characters and universe of a movie talk/act in a certain way that differs from our reality, it adds something to the overall feel of the film that can't be beat. That's just my opinion though. I know there are plenty of people who despise Aaron Sorkin's writing. I, fortunately, am not one of those people. He has an amazing way with words that's absolutely perfect for the screen. It's almost like he makes word set-pieces, situations that are made to fit his bickering and snark so well."
TrueFilm,3defok,SlightlyOffensive,44,Wed Jul 15 17:31:16 2015 UTC,"First thought when it comes to natural dialogue is Richard Linklater  Slacker is a masterclass in natural dialogue, along with A Scanner Darkly  That new documentary about him goes into detail about this... Apparently one  of his actors started improving and Rich was like: ""Hey why don't you try the script""  Because the actor assumed the dialogue in his previous films were improved   opposed to being verbatim in the script  edit: supposed to say improvising, but i wrote improving"

TrueFilm,3defok,lukeimyomama,132,Thu Jul 16 00:01:46 2015 UTC,"Dialogue in film is as unnatural as it gets. In every movie.  Even when dialogue ""sounds"" natural, it's structured, precise, moves with a purpose, avoids digressions and gives the viewer vital information.  Real dialogue is circular, repetitive, interruptive, selfish, and frequently monosyllabic. I don't want to watch a movie with that. Even documentaries are edited to give only the best snippets of dialogue that are then reinforced with voice-over and interviews to fill the gaps where dialogue fails.  In short, in my opinion, film dialogue should not be natural, at all, ever."
TrueFilm,3defok,Deviator77,61,Wed Jul 15 17:58:44 2015 UTC,"What about the mumblecore movement?  The first time I saw a mumblecore film in theatres (Lynn Shelton's Humpday), I was absolutely blown away by the naturalism of the dialogue. While it has become a bit of a joke in certain film circles for being...well...mumbly and not as pointed as scripted dialogue, The Puffy Chair, My Sister's Sister, Drinking Buddies, etc. are frequently some of my favorite films because I find it easier to relate to characters that have similar verbal tics and difficulty expressing themselves as people I know in real life.    I know the Duplass Brothers, for instance, will often script a scene's actions and explain to actors where the conversation should be leading, but leave the dialogue itself largely blank. If you think about it, that's essentially how people speak in general: you know what you want to get across but not the exact words.  I think there's also a place for the more scripted dialogue found in most movies, but I am also extremely fond of the mumblecore mentality."
TrueFilm,3defok,DoorMarkedPirate,16,Wed Jul 15 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/DoorMarkedPirate, there is also a place for improvised-on-the-spot dialogue that sounds as naturalistic as possible. One of my recent favorites is Mark Duplass and Elizabeth Moss in ""The One I Love"". Check it out and see what you think.  I still like scripted dialogue but I enjoy seeing the results of different creative techniques as well."
TrueFilm,3defok,producer35,8,Wed Jul 15 17:50:18 2015 UTC,"I looked up the movement. I'm not too familiar with it, but does Before Sunset count? Someone else here brought up Linklater and many of his movies focus on real sounding conversations. However, even when the movie is focused on ""just talking,"" the dialogue is unnaturally directed down an avenue where the characters end up in preconceived conflicts or resolutions. The uncertainty of direction in real conversations isn't there. And I like that. I'm not usually a fan of meandering plots."
TrueFilm,3defok,Deviator77,15,Wed Jul 15 19:29:40 2015 UTC,"No, Linklater's stuff was influential on Mumblecore as was Dogme 95 but Mumblecore was decidedly later and the dialogue is actually often improvised. To my knowledge, Linklater still scripts the dialogue but leaves it in a naturalistic style.    There are a lot of ""like"" and ""umm"" in mumblecore, but that doesn't mean that the plot is meandering...the plots just happen to revolve around relationships and character development. Humpday, for instance, has quite an enthralling plot in my opinion: two straight friends are trying to decide whether they should have sex with each other for the purpose of a porn festival.   If you want recommendations for some things to check out, generally go with the director and check out a plot that interests you.  Lynn Shelton, Andrew Bujalski, the Duplass Brothers, Joe Swanberg, Whit Stillman, Alex Ross-Perry, a little Noah Baumbach (Frances Ha in particular) and even Lena Dunham (Tiny Furniture) are considered some of the standouts of the genre...I myself particularly enjoy Shelton and the Duplass brothers, but I've never really thought a mumblecore film wasn't worth watching."
TrueFilm,3defok,DoorMarkedPirate,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:56:56 2015 UTC,"I also was thinking about mumblecore. The weird thing is I've seen all the Duplass movies and a few other mumblecore films and they never strike as any more realistic as other documentary-style narratives. It's pretty hard to tell what's scripted and what isn't, and sometimes I think the improvisation makes a scene flat."
TrueFilm,3defok,Vietnom,12,Wed Jul 15 20:37:02 2015 UTC,I think part of what makes Quentin Tarantino films like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp fiction great are that they balance natural dialogue with bombastic dialogue and natural actions with bombastic actions. They talk about tipping while having a meal together. Except they're hired men and none of them know each other's names. That kind of thing.
TrueFilm,3defok,ncolaros,12,Wed Jul 15 21:24:07 2015 UTC,"I agree and disagree..   Yes, it's true. Every dialogue in movies (and TV-Shows) is scripted and therefore 'unnatural'. The art is to make the dialogue seem natural.  You have to find a middle ground between reference slamming in-your-face punchline dialogue or sentences with subtle subtext. Using words that define the character. Is his pool sophisticated or colloquial, is he close to the other person or not?   Natural speak may become, as you say, ""circular, repetitive, interruptive, selfish, and frequently monosyllabic."" But in movies we don't want to see smalltalk (unless it's intended to). Dialogue should let the story advance. And if you speak to another person in a more meaningful way - e.g. telling a story, getting to know each other - the dialogue becomes more structured. Or do you want to say that even real life becomes unnatural if you think before you speak?  In the end dialogue that seems too unnatural harms immersion, and dialogue that is crafted in a 'organic' will help immersion.  Think of it as Gaudí vs Bauhaus. While Bauhaus works, the facades seem loveless; Gaudí's Architecture, while it might seem unpractical, is very interesting to look at."
TrueFilm,3defok,Sympathy_for_Oldboy,3,Sun Jul 19 06:48:30 2015 UTC,That's one of Joss Whedon's strengths. His dialog is always witty and isn't strictly expository. With the ocassional digression and aside. Its one of the things I like about his work.

That is very close-minded... I think what you mean is that you're imagining films you like, with real dialogue switched in for the existing dialogue, and they're now shitty films...

So you've conflated ""film"" with ""conventional film"".  But a Formula 1 car should not have those same parts. In fact, it requires a completely different set of parts to make this machine work.  Different films are different machines. If your blockbuster heist film has natural dialogue, yeah that's probably not the right choice. If it's Drinking Buddies, well that film is actually made up of real dialogue*. And it's not a bad film! It works for a specific type of film, that's all I'm saying. You can't use one tool to do another's job."
TrueFilm,3defok,Raichu93,2,Wed Jul 15 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"How does this apply to movies with improvised dialogue? Stuff like Irreversible, The Blair Witch Project and Coherence?  In particular Coherence had a certain dynamic nature to the screenplay because all the actors knew exactly who they were and played off of each other to make a movie that's basically about a dinner party gone wrong become incredibly fluid and intriguing."
TrueFilm,3defok,TrumanB-12,2,Wed Jul 15 20:27:49 2015 UTC,"This is only my opinion, but I think it still applies. I almost brought up Blair Witch Project because it was largely improvised, but then I realized that I don't remember a single line from the movie.  I do remember The Score. It had a lot of improvisation, but the lines were dropped into the story. They advanced plot or characterization and were not distracting from the direction of the scene. In interviews with the actors, they talked about how their improvised lines worked within the context of the scene and the story. Sometimes the lines didn't work and were cut. More importantly, the actors were thinking about how their lines advanced something within the scene or improved on the script.  The lines may have been improvised, but they weren't organic. They're still driving toward an end....if that makes sense. They still don't sound like the natural conversations we have on a daily basis. Improvisation can mimic a more realistic sounding conversation and make us feel like it's a real conversation, or what we think real conversations sound like, but, in reality, we don't actually talk like that.  I haven't seen Coherence, and maybe it would change my mind. So far, though, nothing else has."
TrueFilm,3defok,Deviator77,2,Thu Jul 16 00:31:36 2015 UTC,"As someone who does improv (on stage) I would say that even improvised dialogue is unlikely to be completely naturalistic because one stays focused on moving things forward, heightening emotion, etc.  Take Curb Your Enthusiasm as an example - plot points are planned but little of the dialogue is pre-written.  Still, the characters concisely move the plot forward (much more so than people in real life tend to do)"
TrueFilm,3defok,Thelonious_Cube,2,Wed Jul 15 23:19:26 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you, I think this might be a red herring.  Suppose we instead focus on dialogue that appears naturalistic vs. dialogue that is more obviously stylized?  When to prefer one over the other?"
TrueFilm,3defok,Thelonious_Cube,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:57:45 2015 UTC,"I generally agree, but I'd like to add my analogy to music: there are genres (and sub genres) in jazz and electronics that often experiment with flipping the roles of percussion and harmonies. Some pieces use vocals and riffs as the background while the rhythm itself becomes the centerpiece. The same approach can be done in other mediums, including film. I suppose realistic, dialog wouldn't count as dialog but it can work. It's just mainstream films and the nature of movies in regard to its length makes it more often of a challenge, but it can be done."
TrueFilm,3defok,imquez,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:16:25 2015 UTC,"In short, in my opinion, film dialogue should not be natural, at all, ever.   What if there is dialogue that is irrelevant to the plot.  Let's say there are two unimportant side characters talking, while a main character, also in the frame, is quietly doing something visually interesting.  I can't think of an example.  You might say that it's more interesting if the side characters are talking about something thematically relevant, or perhaps this doesn't count as dialogue, and is just ""sound,"" which happens to feature audible words and linguisitc content."
TrueFilm,3defok,costofanarchy,4,Wed Jul 15 19:42:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe it would be more interesting if that sounded natural. I can think of a few examples where background noise had distinguishable conversation and it neither hindered nor improved the scene's quality.  However, for the most part, the situation you're describing would fall under ""sound mixing,"" unless explicitly put into the script. If it were put into a script, surely there would be some relevance to it, like a private eye eavesdropping on people at a table behind him. If what they're saying is entirely unimportant, it probably won't matter to me what sounds are coming out of their mouths."
TrueFilm,3defok,Deviator77,2,Wed Jul 15 20:11:04 2015 UTC,"Sure, you could imagine a private eye eavesdropping on people at a table behind him, but it's difficult because a third group of people are having a louder (irrelevant) conversation at a nearby table.  But yes, this is more ""sound mixing"" than dialogue at this point.  But what if this dialogue was in the script, and it was something of personal interest (maybe humorous) to the screenwriter.  This would be a bit indulgent, but wouldn't necessarily be distracting.  I guess at this point, we can start questioning how it would necessarily be natural, but if delivered in a natural way and not serving the outside narrative, maybe it can be natural."
TrueFilm,3defok,costofanarchy,3,Wed Jul 15 23:13:24 2015 UTC,"Think about what people generally converse about.  Do conversations move the events of the day forward, or do they move the characters through the events of the day by filling the space with something other than what they are doing at that moment?  David Mamet's SPARTAN is an excellent example.  Roger Ebert described the dialogue as taking place ""at right angles to the action""...  Dialogue, when properly used, should advance the character development. Action should advance the story."
TrueFilm,3defok,snowdog74,14,Wed Jul 15 23:16:09 2015 UTC,"I like good dialogue. Have you ever listened to a recording of you and your friends having a casual conversation over an hour or more? It's boring, even to you, and you realise how little you're actually saying to each other most of the time. Natural dialogue is only another type of stylised dialogue that nobody talks like. I don't mind it dependi g on the film, but it's just another artifice and a choice, it's not more 'real'."
TrueFilm,3defok,Anzai,12,Thu Jul 16 12:14:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of both stylized and naturalistic dialogue. (As someone else has already pointed out, even the most natural-sounding dialogue, really isn't.)  My favorite film of all time is Robert Altman's ""Nashville,"" which earned both praise and consternation when it came out because of the fragmentary, overlapping dialogue. It sounded rough and almost documentary-like, which wasn't often done in those days.  On the opposite end of the scale, I love several of David Mamet's movies, especially ""House of Games"" and ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" which sound nothing like real life, and are almost a verbal form of music.  I also love Tarantino's dialogue.   They're both just different effects used to different ends, and both can be used well or poorly, just like humor, CGI, color palettes, etc. It's a tool in the filmmaker's toolbox. (I admit to not liking Sorkin's dialogue, though, because everyone sounds smug.)"
TrueFilm,3defok,BoringPostcards,2,Wed Jul 15 18:25:54 2015 UTC,"I remember hearing (it might've been in the documentary Altman) that Altman got fired (or almost got fired) from a TV show early in his career because the characters kept talking over each other.

TrueFilm,3defok,paper_zoe,4,Wed Jul 15 18:37:42 2015 UTC,"I absolutely hate that criticism of Sorkin's dialogue, in part because I find his dialogue mesmerizing, but also because it's sort of a preposterous complaint when you consider that almost nobody on television talks the way people do in the real world. It's not at all important to imitate everyday speech, which is usually boring, inarticulate and repetitive, not to mention undramatic (unless you've got a lot of drama going on in your life). People confuse ""naturalistic"" dialogue with dialogue that doesn't make a show of itself. But dialogue that makes a show of itself isn't inherently bad, and many of the greatest dramatists have written overtly stylized dialogue. For example:  Shakespeare! (and his contemporaries)  Mamet  Kushner  Austen  Chayefsky  Hecht  Hemingway  Chandler  etc.   Dialogue should be engaging. All other rules are misguided and puritanical."
TrueFilm,3defok,doubledoverweeds,4,Wed Jul 15 18:43:16 2015 UTC,"Stylized dialogue is fine as long as it's stylization serves a purpose. In that scene where Frank Semyon talks to his wife in bed about his fucked up events in past, dialogue seemed unnatural - Frank tells a story about himself as a narrator. Which is weird because he himself is a hero in that story. I think directors just took the easy way out when they needed to get the point across to viewers - about what kind of a man Frank is."
TrueFilm,3defok,SirLasberry,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:50:05 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I felt about both seasons. I don't mind stylized dialogue. But just like every other part of filmmaking (lights, camera angle, color, art direction), it better serve a purpose. It should tell us something about the story or about the characters. That doesn't happen in True Detectives. I also felt the same about Sorkin's Newsroom.   This also has the side effect of making the characters interchangeable... Which makes for poor story telling. No one has a unique voice. They are all too clever or witty for their own good. It doesn't serve the story."
TrueFilm,3defok,peteyboy100,4,Wed Jul 15 19:33:46 2015 UTC,"I think both have their place.  I recently attended a theatrical production that was a modern update of a 17th century Italian farce - all of the dialogue was extremely stylized (despite the update) and it worked brilliantly - because it was a farce.  Sorkin's stuff works for me because he's such an idealistic writer to begin with, it's like he's presenting some sort of ""best of all possible worlds"" where everyone can brilliantly and concisely express themselves in subtle detail.  It's not realistic, but it serves the purposes of the script.  On the other hand, you have something like ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" which attempts to be naturalistic (within a certain subculture, so it's still somewhat stylized) where if the characters were too articulate, it would ring false for the setting and the script (""The French Connection"" also comes to mind here)."
TrueFilm,3defok,Thelonious_Cube,3,Wed Jul 15 20:42:21 2015 UTC,"Natural dialogue is difficult because not only is it part of the artform, it's a vehicle to provide the audience with a lot of information. You'll get characters saying things to eachother at times they should already know it, such as a phone call an hour or two before the scene.  Natural dialogue also isn't as polite and rehearsed as we see, or want, on screen. People interrupt each other, and not in the dramatic way, but we'll stumble over each other, mispronounced or jumble our words because we talk too fast, and say things to get our point across quickly, not necessarily in a way we went over in our heads, or on paper, a few dozen times to get the perfect word choice.   You don't want natural dialogue because it's ugly to the ears in the context of film, or just cannot be done with the limited time you have. You can't shoot several dozen scenes spanning a few phone calls or meetings, so you have them reveal all of that info at once to progress the plot - shows like Newsroom suffer a lot from this. And say you want to highlight people beyond dialogue, so you have them playing basketball to show they're sporty, when in reality they wouldn't have that heavy of a conversation when exerting themselves during a game. You'd mostly just hear squeaks of sneakers.  True Detective, as well as a lot of dramas, really suffer from this because of how serious the show is. The director wants to really emphasize the writing to shake the audience. It just would not come across as shocking when done in a more natural, less rehearsed way."
TrueFilm,3defok,AnalogDogg,3,Wed Jul 15 22:49:04 2015 UTC,One example is the way that dialogue is edited in films so that the clips overlap each other slightly. Could you imagine if people in real life spoke that fast? Everyone just cutting off each other's sentences. It's very unnatural but it keeps the pacing which is in my opinion far more important than naturalism.

TrueFilm,3defok,AwesomeDracula,3,Wed Jul 15 23:28:08 2015 UTC,"I think that I'm reiterating what a lot of other people here are saying but I think it all falls into that suspension of disbelief and the universe that the story and characters inhabit.   It's all about the setup and consistency. If the filmmaker/writer establishes a universe where its characters speak in a flashy/stylized manner or with backyard philosophy embedded through it as in True Detective then that's fine as long they stay generally along the same tracks throughout. The same goes for super natural dialogue Richard Linklaters Before Trilogy coming to mind. The point is that for either style problems start to arise and people get put off if it switches  back and forth all the time, there's a sweetspot both can hit and should hit. So it's really all done to the context of the film and what's trying to be achieved.  Side Note: Interesting that you bring up Aaron Sorkin. The guy is without doubt a very talented and intelligent writer but I have this issue with him that a lot of other people have found as well and that is all his characters have essentially the same voice.  If you read his screenplays or just watch some of his films you notice that a lot of his characters speak really similarly i.e. with a witty, rhythmic  and annoyingly intelligent delivery. Every single one of them, from 'The West Wing' to 'The Social Network' they all sound as if they took the same Intro to Witty Quips class in college. Instead of asking how natural dialogue should be I think it's equally if not more important that every character's dialogue should have its own distinct flavor."
TrueFilm,3defok,cpierse,2,Wed Jul 15 18:23:05 2015 UTC,Yeah you're entirely right especially with Woody Allen. I really noticed it with his film 'Celebrity' where he isn't even playing the lead but somehow the writing made Kenneth Branagh really sound like the 1970-80's Woody. I should stress that I don't think it's a necessarily bad thing at all just some variation on a distinct voice is nice because everyone has their nuances in how they speak. Then again it could be argued that actors should be the ones responsible for that.
TrueFilm,3defok,cpierse,2,Wed Jul 15 21:08:51 2015 UTC,"I think that, like with a lot of things, trying so hard to be real (in this case, real dialogue) can come across as seeimgly fake and that is the worst way to handle something.   Funny you should mention Sorkin, who I believe to be an artist with TV/film dialogue (at least outside the stage) and yet somehow the scrips and so on he writes are stunning.   I guess what I'm trying to say is I see real diolouge on a dade by case basis, on what I think of the plot and characters and the words they speak.

I don't think there's any point on the spectrum of naturalistic to stylized dialogue that every film should aim for. It depends on what kind of film someone wants to make.  I've seen fantastic films with stylized dialogue (Barry Lyndon comes to mind, most notably the scene with Captain Feeney), and I've seen fantastic films with naturalistic dialogue (Frances Ha comes to mind, as does Listen Up Philip). Of course, there are also terrible examples of each, and everything in between too.  At the end of the day good writing is good writing, and the same can be said of acting and directing. Highly stylized content in the hands of competent and capable filmmakers will be good, as will naturalistic material. That's all that it really comes down to, I think."
TrueFilm,3defok,GalacticCannibalism,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:59:40 2015 UTC,"It's usually dependent on the filmmaker's auteur, but I would say it SHOULD depends on the concept and context of the film, details like this helps reinforce the overall feel and can have drastic effects when coupled with story/lighting/design/cinematograph.   The dialogue is another element to better assist the directors vision he's trying to convey to the audience; this creates a better, metaphorical, bridge for the audience to cross over. The more details, the easier the audience has a time crossing over to see his world.   Some films, more than others might call for more realistic dialogue, where others might benefit from campy lines or spot on delivery."
TrueFilm,3defok,Vietnom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:30:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's such thing as ""natural"" dialogue. Mumblecore movies are more improvised than scripted films, but that doesn't necessarily equate to ""natural,"" though it is probably more similar to what we hear on a daily basis.   Written language is also natural, in a way, and when it comes to storytelling perhaps more natural. A fictional story is not meant to be an exact replica of life as it happens, or else it wouldn't be fiction. It is more natural for a story to have a point of view, or a message, or at least a theme, which are more inherent in the written word. I would say that situational improvisation is the more unnatural method when it comes to storytelling."
TrueFilm,3df0cc,The_Silver_Avenger,31,Wed Jul 15 19:26:33 2015 UTC,"While I definitely sympathize with the thrust of the argument -- that Pixar movies tend to reflect a capitalist ethos rooted in the company's dual defining characteristics as both a center of storytelling creativity and an innovative tech giant -- I think the author overstates his case in a few areas, finding sinister motivations (or, perhaps, cynical institutional side-effects) where there simply is a differing value system.  He thinks of Pixar as some monolithic dehumanizing structure wherein it is impossible to separate work from leisure, while, in my mind, it is just a company shaped and populated by people who love their jobs. I'm going to focus on Docter and his films here because I've been reading a lot about him due to Inside Out: Monsters Inc. is about someone who loves their work making time for their family, rather than becoming an ""efficient employee."" UP was inspired by how difficult it is for Pete Docter, a self-described introvert, to direct other people at work. In my interpretation, it evolved into much more than just wanting to retire. I'll give him Cars, and he completely missed a huge opportunity in Toy Story. (Rather than mainly being about simply ""competition for a job"", I think of it as a celebration of the humanistic characteristics inherent to capitalism, not that I would expect the author, after reading his essay, to interpret it that way. Look at A.O. Scott's review of Toy Story 3 to see a more nuanced take.) What I most object to is how he sees these ""celebrations of labor"" (i.e. love of doing something that is further rewarded by our economic infrastructure) and capitalism as evidence of some obsession of Pixar's with defining personal identity as work, while ignoring its criticisms of the same as some smokescreen designed to allow their ""true"" messages to go down easier. Its hard for me to see this as anything other than a pre-conceived conclusion in search of evidence.   I also completely disagree with the notion that any individual vision in the company is ""sanitized"" for mass consumption. It is true that Pixar is run much closer to a ""classic"" studio where the artists are more closely associated with the studio as a whole than the project/director, but that seems to be more an acknowledgement of the collaborative nature of filmmaking, especially in animation, than the snuffing out of individual voices. You can watch any Pixar film and see the mark of the auteur directing it throughout. Though Docter came up with the kernel of the idea that became WALL-E, Stanton is the one who most connected with it and eventually directed it. They make it a point to foster individual ownership of, and therefore pride in, sequences by individual animators. Perhaps, for a cynic, this collaborative style is good corporate management, but it seems to look to me like enthusiastic people connecting, creating, and, yes, working together -- which is basically all filmmaking. It's telling that the ""testing"" at Pixar is for other members of the company (which is why, I assume, they want everyone to be knowlegable about filmmaking), rather than for some ""representative"" demographic that a PR firm brought in.

This is where it starts to lose me, because a) I just don't like rhetorical questions whose only purpose is to reiterate your point, and more importantly b) because it betrays a naivete on the part of the author about how the entertainment industry is structured.    That there could be any production house operating today with a singular shared goal/obsession is simply not possible.  The studio system is long gone, and it was barely monolithic in the first place.  Pixar specifically is well known to have an open door policy with its employees when it comes to pitching new films, and while I'm sure they tend to lean toward stories that reflect on their brand to some degree, there's just no way they're SO disciplined about it that every film they make is tailored to communicate the same implicit propaganda.  There's no way.  Overall though, I think if the article had been written in a way that held off on making value judgements, it would've made a fairly interesting observation.  Yes, Pixar films tend to deal with people struggling to succeed in a capitalist environment more often than other children's films.  But I can't buy that this inherently requires judgement, or that it is instantly a bad thing just because it isn't obvious at first glance.  That says more about the author than it does Pixar."

The Conspirator (2010) and North Country (2005) are two examples which might suggest that most producers are interested only in true-story courtroom dramas these days."
TrueFilm,3df9sq,doubledoverweeds,13,Thu Jul 16 01:31:51 2015 UTC,"It most likely has to do with the market, or a lack of demand for them.

However, 12 Angry Men takes place almost exclusively inside the jury room so even that is not a traditional ""courtroom drama"" as there's practically no scenes in court.   The difficulty with courtroom drama is that they rely extensively on dialogue and so the screenplay has to be airtight (12AM has one of the best screenplays ever). There's not many screenwriters who can write engaging, interesting dialogue that can carry an entire movie in the way courtroom dramas demand. However, Aaron Sorkin's (The Social Network, The West Wing, A Few Good Men) style of writing definitely fits this mould."

TrueFilm,3dcf4f,Tsegen,5,Wed Jul 15 21:10:05 2015 UTC,"That's because this is the most common form of whitewashing.  Basically, most directors don't care what the background actors look like, so that often gets thrown to background casting to get X number of ""NDs"" - NonDescript extras.  Except for rare occasions, ND casting tends to mainly focus on the ratio of two race descriptions: white and ""ethnic"".  And all background casting cares about when making the call for what this ratio is, is how ""upscale"" or ""downscale"" the scene is.  If it's more upscale, they lean white.  If it's more downscale, they lean ethnic.  Jurassic World is an expensive park, ergo they lean white.   Sometimes you get a director who thinks of these things, like Spielberg, and casting actually gets to work with honest-to-god descriptions for the types of extras he wants on screen.

I guess my thought on reading your post was that the Costa Rican label for the airport they landed in was enough for me to follow it must be in the Caribbean not too far from Costa Rica.

(what a strange thing to yell right before certain death) was flawless American, so I'd say Japanese-American.     Did you feel like the first Jurassic Park did more to establish that the movie was in the Caribbean than Jurassic World did?   Absolutely.  In the first scene, you hear people operating the raptor crate speaking in Spanish to each other.  In the second scene, the lawyer visits a local archaeological dig (where they're digging up the amber with mosquitoes) where everyone else in the scene is Latino, and also Spanish is being spoken.  Much later, Hammond (the owner) mentions that his gourmet chef is ""Alejandro.""  In later scenes, there are construction workers in the background but they're way too far in the back to see their faces, but their clothing implies ""local"" (of course, that's not proof, since anyone can wear local clothing).  Also, as /u/chicagofirefifa3's points out, the scene where Wayne Knight and Dodgson meet at a local cafe.    /u/chicagofirefifa3's analysis is very convincing.  And if it was a deliberate choice by the director, it works.  The JW park does feel like it's no longer in the Caribbean.  Instead, it's a super rich international resort project.  But I'm still curious, are the staff at Disneyland, Disney World, and Universal Studios like that or do they, in reality, actually have a lot of local Latinos working there?   But in the end, Jurassic Park wants to show a ""grittier"" version of what it means to open a theme park, while JW wants to show the most smooth-running, streamlined park at its prime.

My argument is more trying to parse the location details we are given and trying to find out what the script considered important and it seemed to me the only thing they really tried hard to establish was that theme park feel. so it's less that it ""wasn't"" in the Caribbean (as you point out they establish it is in it) than it really focused on another aspect of the setting which in practice crowded out the actual location. It's ""american theme park"" first and caribbean island second."

Take Pitch Perfect 2, for example. I have never seen a more reprehensible representation of the Hispanic people as that insipid Guatemalan stock-character director Elizabeth Banks and company dared call a ""person."" It harkens back to the days of Blake Edwards's equally foolish decision to cast Mickey Rooney as a buck-toothed Japanese named Mr. Yunioshi in Breakfast at Tiffany's for broad comedic effect.  The result is a same: repulsion in the audience. The people I was sitting with were aghast, and as a Hispanic-American, I can tell you that I was disgusted beyond all belief. The filmmakers used a real-life problem (the danger of deportation of one's own family) for pseudo-edgy laughs, and for the most part, it seemed to have worked. My friends were disgusted, but everyone else around us was having a gay old laugh at the ""boldness"" of such humor.  And yet, Pitch Perfect 2 was a tremendous commercial success. Evidently, the  racial humor (not just at the Hispanics, but at the blacks and LGBT viewers and the Asians, too) was not enough to deter audiences making this soulless, trashy, formless comedy earn $100 million in its opening weekend, surpassing the Box-office of the original in only 5 days, and surprassing Richard Linklater's much-better studio-comedy The School of Rock as the highest-grossing musical-comedy of all time. And the racial humor didn't stop the critics from praising it, only pooh-poohing and lambasting the ""unfortunate"" Hispanic cracks, and going on to say that the musical numbers in PP2 outclassed anything bad about it.  Hispanics provide the manpower for film crews, and yet they are STILL being stereotyped and/or marginalized in Hollywood's memory banks. The best Hispanic auteurs (Cuaron, Del Toro) confine themselves to big-budget action-pics, while the Hispanic auteurs who really do tackle the perspective of Latinos in America are pretty much all confined to the independent film market. The best of the lot, Gregory Nava (who directed the masterful El Norte--about the Latino immigrant experience--and Selena--a lively biopic about the murdered Tex-Mex singer Selena Quintanilla), was essentially run out of Hollywood because the very same audiences who would flock in droves to go see Pitch Perfect 2 mock Hispanics refused to go see his last film in 2006, Bordertown. It was a dismal failure, and he hasn't worked ever since.   It's still a shame that we can't find good roles for new Hispanic up-and-comers to shine, and that we're still stuck with peddling the minstrel-show-reject-pile to derive cheap laughs out of audiences with racially confused movies like Pitch Perfect 2. It's even worse when Hispanics aren't represented at all--like we don't exist.

All one needs to do to understand just how not true this is is to look at the defining moment of American and Central American relations - the Mexican American War - and the public response to it. Press coverage and feelings towards the war were marred by racial bias and a fear of Mexicans, which in turn typified American sentiments towards Hispanics overall. While Hispanics may not have seen themselves as anything but white, white Americans certainly did.   The big exception to this were those ""pure"" individuals who were descended from clean Spanish stock (they still suffered mistrust and second class status due to their faith), but the vast majority of what we would today call Hispanics were exempt from this. This relationship was constantly evolving, but at no point have Americans seen Hispanics as equals.   I'm at work, but when I get home I'll get around to providing sources.

Guadalupe Hidalgo, which brought about the end of the Mexican - American War in 1846, declared Mexican Americans as “white”.

Unfortunately this definition of white essentially prevented Hispanics from any protections that might have come with the 14th amendment.    Hispanics were not recognized as a minority deserving rights declared under the 14th amendment until the supreme court case Hernádez v. the State of Texas in 1954.

TrueFilm,3dcf4f,mynameismarkcarlos,17,Wed Jul 15 14:48:47 2015 UTC,"Ding Ding Ding, you've really nailed this on the head. Simply put, Latino American filmmakers, our home grown Latino storytellers (and there many, trust me) simply aren't being given the opportunities or success that the international Latin filmmakers have been given (Del Toro, Cuaron, Iñárritu). These international directors may have once made a film about the Latino experience in their specific country, but boom, the second they achieve cross over success and a Hollywood budget, elect to mainly work with white Hollywood actors. It's troublesome and the implications are enormous. It's as Sasha Stone wrote in her great piece a few months ago:  ""... Boy how those [Oscar] voters love their Mexican directors, huh? But only when those directors come from Mexico. The problem with the oppressed under classes of whites vs. Latinos is happening here in America. Progress will take place when a Mexican American director is recognized or even acknowledged. Inarritu winning after Cuaron winning is not going to fix the problem here.  Alfonso Cuaron and Alejandro Inarritu have the distinction of being the ONLY TWO directors who not only hail from Mexico, but the only directors who come from any Latin country at all, that makes them the only two Hispanic directors in all of Oscar history. When Sean Penn made a “green card” joke about Inarritu (even in jest) I don’t think it ultimately diminished the director, although it certainly could have, because Inarritu’s heartfelt speech about Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants upstaged it.  But Cuaron and Inarritu, for instance, would simply not get the same opportunities as Mexican-American directors were they born and raised here. Steve McQueen’s 12 Years a Slave became the first film by a black director to win Best Picture yet Hollywood and the Oscars have a shameful and embarrassing record for African-American filmmakers, shutting out Ava DuVernay this year, but Ryan Coogler and Spike Lee to name others. Those doors are not opened. For Mexican-American filmmakers it is even worse as they are not anywhere near the conversation, not yet anyway. Here’s hoping Cuaron and Inarritu’s win will inspire more notice on the young Americans making films about American culture, which is woefully in need of attention."""
TrueFilm,3dcf4f,Sureiyaa,19,Wed Jul 15 09:20:27 2015 UTC,"I couldn't disagree more with Stone's criticism. It diminishes the accomplishments of Cuaron and Inarritu by mocking the Academy's voting behavior. For what reason? To state the obvious: that representation in Hollywood is a work in progress. It's clear the Academy doesn't recognize Hispanic American directors, or actors, often enough. It's also clear the Academy doesn't recognize Mexican born directors often either. (This is nothing to say of Brazilian born, Cuban born, Peruvian born, et al directors.) Just what does it mean for someone to say the Academy loves Mexican born directors only when just two have been recognized in its history?  But what's worse is how Stone's criticism doesn't cut at the heart of the issue. She asserts Mexican-American (again, this is nothing to say of Brazilian-American, Cuban-American, Peruvian-American, et al) filmmakers wouldn't be given the same opportunity as Cuaron and Inarritu, and while I'm sympathetic to that claim, she doesn't argue it. How could she argue it? By arguing the three most well known Latin American auteurs are Mexican born? She's going to make an argument on the success of three directors? In not qualifying that claim, and hence not thinking about it, she doesn't see the underlying causes of Hollywood's dearth of stories about Hispanic American culture, even as they stare her right in the face.  She hopes Cuaron and Inarritu's wins will ""inspire"" young, Hispanic American filmmakers to create stories about their experiences. This places the onus not on Hollywood to hire more Hispanic American filmmakers, but on Hispanic American filmmakers themselves. This is likely not her intension, but that is the consequence of her words. But how can young Hispanic Americans become filmmakers, or even artists, when Hispanic Americans are underpaid, uninsured, and incarcerated? There is a constellation of racist institutions—from the carceral state to a failed public education system—preventing Hispanic Americans from becoming artists, and Stone would rather mock the Academy for awarding not one but two Mexican born directors for their accomplishments?  Give me a fucking break."

As a society (and Hollywood as a microcosm of American society) we like to pat ourselves on the back for little tiny long overdue baby steps toward justice. I agree that it's shitty to take shots at Inarritu and Cuaron over this, but I think they're collateral damage of a bigger shot at the Academy. And I think saying to the Academy ""Good for you, you recognized two Mexicans. But you shit is still all fucked up"" is pretty valid. I don't agree with pitting Mexican-Americans against Mexicans, but I'm not sure if she did that as there is no close-quote on that quote...  I'm surprised you say you disagree so wholeheartedly with the criticism while pointing out the plight of Latinos in the U.S. I don't think she is mocking the Academy for awarding Inarritu and Cuaron... she's mocking them for thinking they're saints for it, and reminding us this must not be the end of social progress in the industry."

Have you ever thought it's because those baby steps are fucking difficult to take?  We live in a country that moves at a glacial pace. We like to look at the success of the Civil Rights Movement as restricted to the mid-1950s and 1960s. That couldn't be further from the truth. The Civil Rights Movement was successful because of decades of activism preceding it, activism that couldn't have happened without the migration of 7,000,000 black Southerners to Northern, Midwestern, and Southwestern cities. That structural change was slow.   I agree that it's shitty to take shots at Inarritu and Cuaron over this, but I think they're collateral damage of a bigger shot at the Academy.   Hold up. If they're collateral damage of a bigger shot at the Academy, should't you consider if they are worthy of being collateral damage?  ""Collateral damage"" implies Inarritu and Cuaron are like two ants you don't mind squashing on the way to get milk at the grocery store. But they aren't ants, they're the only Latin American directors to ever receive an Academy Award for their work.   I'm surprised you say you disagree so wholeheartedly with the criticism while pointing out the plight of Latinos in the U.S.    Pointing out the plight of Latinos in the U.S. conveyed the greater structural problems preventing them from becoming artists. It's a criticism of the author on her own terms, since she pit Mexican directors against Mexican American directors, when that isn't the problem.  I disagree with OP's accompanying criticism of The Three Amigos (as they're called in Hollywood) casting mostly white actors too. As one of the few Mexican directors in Hollywood, shouldn't they have the freedom to do create whatever they want, with the actors they want to do so with? Shouldn't they have the same freedom given to non-Hispanic white directors?   I don't think she is mocking the Academy for awarding Inarritu and Cuaron... she's mocking them for thinking they're saints for it, and reminding us this must not be the end of social progress in the industry.   This is hilarious posturing though. In no way shape or form can you conclude the Academy thinks they're ""saints"" for awarding Inarritu and Cuaron Best Directors. Some may feel good about it as social progress, but do they think they're ""saintly""? Likely not."
TrueFilm,3dcf4f,fourbet,2,Fri Jul 17 16:49:27 2015 UTC,"All really good points, and re-reading your original post I think you're right about Stone setting up an unfair dichotomy. I don't think it's unfair to the Academy, but it's unfair to the Mexican directors she's standing on to make her point. It's not really the Academy, either, who are target... the Academy is just a proxy for the industry. The Academy Awards was just the focal point for this criticism. The film industry is part of the ""constellation of racist institutions,"" and I don't think it's absolutely necessary to explain the entire U.S. social context in order to call out Hollywood.    Saints was hyperbole (mine, not hers), and perhaps collateral damage was a poor choice of phrasing. I think there is a justifiable tendency to be dissatisfied with the slow pace of social progress. And the fact that we often mark that progress by the effortless decision (say, casting a vote) of a bunch of powerful privileged people. Sure, baby steps are hard to take, but using your example, do you think black folks of the 40's wanted to hear about how awfully hard it would be for white people to just let them into their schools? To live in their neighborhoods? Do you think they should be satisfied that the pace of social change is glacial? The slow pace of change in this country is a historical fact. It's not a logical necessity.   So I agree with your basic premise that the success of the Three Amigos is a good thing, and laudable. I think that the fact that these guys are mostly working in a white American idiom as they reach the upper echelons of Hollywood success is telling. I don't think they should have any less freedom than white directors to choose who to cast; I think the same criticism should be (and is) leveled at white directors. Cuaron, et al., are working inside that constellation of racist institutions, but the fact that they are Mexican should not insulate them from criticism. It shouldn't necessarily make them targets either. I don't know a lot about Sasha Jones... specifically whether she is even Latina. I think there is a sort-of intra-group standing to criticize members of a minority group for ""selling out""-- it happens all the time. Minority groups place more responsibility on their people to do better than all the white dudes in power. The story would be a lot more clear-cut if this was a Chicana woman criticizing Chicano directors for their all-white casts-- the kind of thing we're usually talking about in these cases is Latinos with the shared history of immigration... not guys who came to this country as already successful filmmakers. I think all directors have a duty to be conscious of the way their efforts in the industry either perpetuate or reduce social inequality. I don't think the Three Amigos should be given a break in that arena, and ultimately I don't think some internet commentater's criticism of these powerful millionaires does them much harm."

It's not a logical necessity.   So your commentary largely falls into the pitfalls of a kind of liberal dialect: namely that society should be a certain way; if society isn't that way then there is a problem not only with society but with the mechanism that makes society a better place one step at a time. I take no issue with the desire to change society. I take issue with your equivocation of ""logical necessity"" and ""should,"" as that is the way you're using ""logical necessity.""  The civil rights activists who dismantled Jim Crow are heroes who were aware of how ""awfully hard it would be for white people to just let them into their schools."" They did it anyways. To them, dismantling Jim Crow was a huge undertaking, requiring not just strategic coalition building, but an understanding of what problems to tackle. This was wonderfully portrayed in Selma, when the SCLC met before MLK's meeting with LBJ. The SCLC didn't tell MLK to tell LBJ to end racism, they fought over what law held back black Southerners the most.  And yet, many people who speak of this era today consider the victory of civil rights movement to be inevitability. Those who speak of it so reverentially are naively scolded by people who say, ""that was a baby step. There is still much work to do.""  These scolds would never succeed as activists. They don't understand several things: substantial change is impossible without coalition building, and coalition building requires appealing to those with the greatest amount of power: the privileged. If you don't have many of them on your side, you won't succeed. Their support is a logical necessity. But because it takes long for them to see the light, societal change becomes glacial, and hence, a logical necessity too.  But our definition of ""societal change"" is really too vague. What do we mean when we say ""societal change?"" How long must it last? Must it be stable? And if so, how can societal change become stable?  There's a lot of political science on this issue, and Latin America is a lush example to better our understanding of it. Democracy wasn't stable for much of Latin American history; consequently, Latin America is one of the most unequal regions in the world. Liberation from Spain (as an aside, the wars for independence were fundamentally conservative. They were reactions against the crown's legislation that would give more evenly distribute political power to its citizens. Latin American elites didn't like this, so they rebelled) was followed by shoddy political institution, which collapsed because of civil wars. Latin America missed out on the industrial revolution because of this. In the post-WWII era, when Latin American populists gained power, social welfare programs expanded rapidly. Societal change wasn't happening at a glacial pace. It was racing like Crockett and Tubes on I95. But these social welfare programs took too much from the rich, who had military power. Coups upon coups upon coups swept the region, and military dictatorship remained in power for decades, torturing any dissenters.  Countries in Latin America that didn't collapse into dictatorship had stable political institutions. And they had stable political institutions because they doled out societal change just slowly enough to placate those who demanded it but not quickly enough to piss off those with a great amount of political power.  If you want society to change on a fundamental level, if you want society to look so different today than it did decades ago, you want that change to be stable. You don't want that change to be lost because of foolishness. And so, yes, glacial change is necessary for this happen.   I don't think the Three Amigos should be given a break in that arena, and ultimately I don't think some internet commentater's criticism of these powerful millionaires does them much harm.   For one, Jones isn't Hispanic. She's white. That isn't to say she can't make meaningful commentary because she's white. She's just white. If she were Hispanic, it wouldn't make her points anymore salient, even if non-Hispanic whites felt it did.  And yes, I agree, Internet commentary won't affect the Three Amigos, but here we are. Talking about them. The Three Amigos are no different from any other director, insofar as their responsibilities go. And yet, OP's comment suggests they have a greater responsibility to cast Latin American actors than white directors do. No, no they don't. If anything, its white directors who bear the brunt of responsibility, not the Three Amigos."
TrueFilm,3dcf4f,abrightersummerday,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:47:59 2015 UTC,"I think you're way off course talking about Latin American history. The stability of political regimes is a case study in precisely that, the stability of political regimes. Not to mention your analysis, particularly of post-WW2 Latin America, completely ignores the context of the cold war and the meddling of larger powers. Allende, Arbenz, the Sandinistas--- all fell with considerable influence from U.S. government and corporations, not because their radical changes were internally unsustainable. I guess that falls into your theory of pissing of ""those with a great amount of political power,"" but this brand of realpolitik doesn't do a lot for me. Sometimes we talk about the pragmatic, and sometimes we talk about the moral.    My ""logical necessity"" is about 'is vs. ought'. You have that right. And once again, dissatisfaction with status quo with regards to social equality is not ""scolding""; it's dissatisfaction. I don't think there's a contradiction between speaking reverentially of the civil rights movement and thinking that there is still much work to do. And every social critique doesn't need to be tempered by pragmatism. The people who put in decades of struggle to move from Jim Crow to full political equality (such as it is) are not the ones being ""scolded"" by those who say we have a long way to go. It's the power-holders of contemporary society. It's a moral ""scolding"" of the society at large, and it's eminently reasonable.  I think it's ultimately a tone and timing issue. For example, there were queer activists who ""scolded"" in the wake of the recent Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage, for various reasons. And like Cuaron's Oscar success, I don't think it's always good practice to rain on the parade of incremental victories in order to highlight continuing inequality. But ""should"" is necessary to social progress. As for the Three Amigos' responsibility to cast Latin American actors--- I'm not personally suggesting that theirs is greater than white directors. I think there needs to be a seismic shift much greater than any 1 or 3 directors, and I think white people--as the primary people in power in Hollywood--bear the brunt of that responsibility. I think we're in agreement there. I'm merely trying to explain the disappointment that minorities feel when ""their people"" get to a position of influence and don't use it to make change. The fact that Sasha Jones is white does make a difference to me there; and I give her less standing in calling these guys out in such a way. It doesn't affect salience of her points, but it hollows out the emotional resonance.   I think we're up against a wall here. We have a fundamental disagreement about the nature of social change. I more or less agree with you (at this point) that Jones' commentary was misdirected. And I agree with you about who has the (moral) responsibility/onus in situations of inequality (the powerful, obviously). But I don't agree with you that people who are dissatisfied with the pace or scope of social progress are simply ""scolders."" Or that any critique of baby steps is unproductive. Or that a little bit of eyerolling is in order when people in power pat themselves on the back for deigning to let one or two new faces into their club."
TrueFilm,3dcf4f,ApollosCrow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:26:02 2015 UTC,"I think you're way off course talking about Latin American history. The stability of political regimes is a case study in precisely that, the stability of political regimes.    But the stability of political regimes is dependent on societal change, which is what we're talking about! Either argue that isn't the case, or don't.    All fell with considerable influence from U.S. government and corporations, not because their radical changes were internally unsustainable.   Yes, this is true. But what you're describing, a full attribution of the failures of Latin America to American fuckery, otherwise known as dependency theory, has fallen out of favor among economists, political scientists, and historians. It was useful and necessary when modernization theory was in full swing in the 1950s. As a Latin American, I'm proud of it. It was one of the great contributions Latin American scholars made to the social sciences. But it's simply wrong. There's no two ways about it.  Now, I'm going to emphasize what I didn't say in the paragraph above because it's certainly easy for anyone to misread it. I didn't say U.S. intervention isn't an important factor in the development of Latin American countries. To say so would be completely ignorant of history. What's also ignorant of history is asserting this is the most most important factor in Latin American development. It isn't. Your assessment of Allende's regime is...odd because his regime was internally unsustainable. Arturo Valenzuela's masterful The Breakdown of Democratic Regimes: Chile does a great job of detailing that.  I didn't think I'd have to actually cite political science papers, but here they are. Regarding my assertion about Latin American countries that didn't descend into dictatorship, I give you James Mahoney's ""Radical, Reformist and Aborted Liberalism: Origins of National Regimes in Central America"" from the Journal of Latin American Studies. Mahoney's primary argument is Costa Rica's success is due to their reformist liberal government, whereas other countries' failures are due to foreign intervention that rained bullshit on reformist liberalism, or radical liberalism.  But the crux of my argument comes from MIT economists' David Acemoglu and James Robinson's Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy. On Argentina:   The nature of Argentine society meant that democracy was not stable. Traditional interests were too threatened by the rise to power of the Radicals, and continuously worked to undermine democracy. ... The workers became stronger and more militant as they found a leader in Perón and the distributional conflicts then became embedded in the pro-Perón, anti-Perón struggle. Dictatorial regimes collapsed because of social protests, and democracies collapsed because the radical, populist and often unsustainable policies they adopted induced military coups.   (so, first off, do you see how social change, and regime stability are inseparable?)  Throughout the book, they use Argentina to inform their worldview on social progress. It's well researched, there's stats to back it, there's historical examples to back it. Simply put, it's fucking well argued social science. And if you wanna dismiss it so glibly because it doesn't mesh with your worldview, so be it. You just won't know very much about other very good arguments out there.    Sometimes we talk about the pragmatic, and sometimes we talk about the moral.   These are two sides of the same coin. If the pragmatic yields the greatest benefit to the oppressed, while the ""moral""—that loose term you use—then the pragmatic is what we ought to go with. I don't think of ""pragmatists"" as belonging to the Borg. There are pragmatists who're more daring than others. It's where the most important conversation happens: how far can we push for social change before it blows up in our face?    The people who put in decades of struggle to move from Jim Crow to full political equality (such as it is) are not the ones being ""scolded"" by those who say we have a long way to go. It's the power-holders of contemporary society. It's a moral ""scolding"" of the society at large, and it's eminently reasonable.   This is a huge misreading of what I wrote.    Those who speak of it so reverentially are naively scolded by people who say, ""that was a baby step. There is still much work to do.""   The scolds aren't speaking about American society directly. They're speaking to those who say, ""gee, we've made a lot of progress"" (true) and mocking them for it, even tho that statement doesn't imply, ""we should stop trying to make our country better.""  I have zero problems with people who say ""we still have a long ways to go."" I have a problem with people who don't appreciate just how difficult it was to get to where we are today. And it just so happens to be that the scolds I'm referring to (ex: Jones) fall into that group of people."

TrueFilm,3dcf4f,fourbet,3,Fri Jul 17 00:42:24 2015 UTC,Do you not consider Javier Bardem and Gael Bernal Garcia to be Hispanic? They're both second language English speakers and have won dozens of awards. I'd say Hollywood has treated them just fine.  Ricardo Darin and Wagner Moura put out fantastic award winning work consistently in the South American market. The Sheen and Pheonix families did pretty well in Hollywood.  You seem to be cherry picking examples pretty heavy.
TrueFilm,3dcf4f,abrightersummerday,21,Wed Jul 15 07:17:04 2015 UTC,Well Gael Bernal and Javier Bardem are Hispanic.  But only Gael Garcia Bernal is Latino.  To be Hispanic you must be from a Spanish speaking country or have Spanish speaking Heritage.  To be a Latino your Heritage is Latin American.  Which starts from Mexico all the way down to South America.   Also just because a few hispanic actors have made it does not mean there isn't  representation problem in Hollywood.
TrueFilm,3dcf4f,ApollosCrow,2,Wed Jul 15 12:15:22 2015 UTC,"Kinda funny that you include the Sheens, who picked up an Anglo surname to make it in Hollywood, and the Phoenixes who are... not 'Hispanic.' Besides the other problems mentioned by /u/Ingenium21 and /u/ApollosCrow.  Seems like you were able to come up with one Latino actor on the A-List (Gael Garcia Bernal). If you're trying to argue that Hollywood treats Latinos/Hispanic people fine and that's all you've got, I think it proves the point."
TrueFilm,3dcf4f,TotesMessenger,2,Wed Jul 15 08:34:10 2015 UTC,Think you responded to the wrong comment :)  And you're totally right - cherry picking a few successful Hispanics is just pointing out the exceptions that prove the rule.

TrueFilm,3dcf4f,abrightersummerday,2,Fri Jul 17 11:39:04 2015 UTC,"Dude. Are you really going to do this here? This really isn't the place for your Reddit-meme version of discussing social issues. Exaggerated sarcasm, exclamation points, ""TIL"", misunderstanding of the privilege concept... why don't you find somewhere else to pick this fight?  Yes, I'm aware of stage names. You'd think the fact that I brought them up in my post would indicate that. If you can find me an actor who changed his Anglo name to a Latino one because of the ethnically neutral and socially contextless nature of the stage name concept, I'd be glad to see it.  Re: Joaquin Phoenix, most people would consider the child of white U.S.-Americans, who lived like 4 years of his life traveling around Latin America, nominally Hispanic at best. The term 'Hispanic' is pretty nebulous to begin with, but no, the way most people use term, Joaquin Phoenix would not be considered Hispanic.  I didn't say Hollywood hates Latinos, but I know that someone making the kind of argument you're making in the style you're making it might not understand the difference between ""hate"" and systematic/institutional discrimination. ""Hate"" and old-school mouth-foaming racism is a more convenient straw man, but this issue is more complex than that. Once again, you've come up with a handful of actors, a couple of whom are pretty ironic choices, another one who is questionably Hispanic, and the rest of whom are not even U.S.-Hispanic/Latinos (which is more the issue when we're talking about a U.S.-based industry).  Wagner Moura got cast because he's presumably talented and Netflix needed a Latino for their shitty-looking exploitation series that absolutely couldn't have gotten away with casting a white U.S.-American (things have at least changed that much). You're grasping at straws to come up with a handful of names in an industry that puts out hundreds of films per year, while Hispanic/Latinos make up 17% of the U.S. population and 47% of L.A. It's ridiculous.   Now if you want to go back to discussing this like adults do, that's cool with me. If you want to keep putting words in my mouth and acting like we're in a default sub arguing with 14-year-olds, I'm done."

So you took an argument about whether Hispanics are underrepresented in Hollywood all the way to the narrow question of whether Joaquin Phoenix is Hispanic or not.  Honestly, it's not my call, and it's not yours either. And it doesn't make much difference to in the face of the overwhelmingly tiny number of Latinos who have major roles in Hollywood, especially compared to their numbers in the country and state. But I know you probably won't address this point, because your main tactic is to divert, divert, divert. And continue putting words in my mouth.

Oh yeah, easy peezy.  You don't think setting the bar that high isn't also a kind of prejudice? It's the same struggle blacks have gone through in America - having to ""prove"" worth through extraordinary accomplishments before being taken seriously or given equal opportunities in a given field.

Yes those negative stereotypes exist within the film, but is that why Pitch Perfect 2 was successful? No, in fact many who saw the film were probably unaware of that aspect of the film coming in; only to perhaps leave with an off putting taste in their mouths in an otherwise alright film. 'Pitch Perfect 2' has a lot of other factors going on that contributed to its success, it is unfortunate though that a film such as that could still find it acceptable to have such stereotypes within it. I agree with you on the other aspects though, especially having new Latina/o talent trying to enter the industry; it's hard for anyone, but it seems especially hard for the filmmakers that you mentioned. It's especially perplexing that you can have successful Mexican directors such as Cuaron, Del Toro, or Iñárritu who may still be considered different because they are perhaps 'foreign' but Latino directors have a much more difficult time reaching the same audiences and levels within the industry. My hope is that eventually the major studios will wake up to the statistics that they could be making a ton more money by targeting Hispanic people, and then they'll realize they need to actually hire Hispanic people to target them because if they want to be specific and authentic and actually have people interested- it is the only way to do it."

PP2 was extremely successful owing to the cult following of the original, of course; people are going to want to see Anna Kendrick and company sing for the second time. Yet with that extreme success, one has to grapple with the fact that so many people were exposed to the not-so-casual racism embedded in the movie. And if the popular responses are any indication, then people are surprisingly OK with that racism because they are not raising hell about it like people in this thread and in other scant places. That's why you get critics idiotically labeling this sort of tripe-bigotry as ""unfortunate,"" as if nothing could have been done to avoid it.  ...when in fact, many things could have been done to avoid it. A writer, a producer, the director--somebody could have stepped up to say, ""You know, people; I don't think it's productive and/or funny to use the Latino/Hispanic people as fodder for our jokes.""

TrueFilm,3dcf4f,cjf4,12,Wed Jul 15 16:30:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to argue that Hollywood doesn't have a problem with casting predominantly white actors in films. However, the visage of white Americans traveling to Isla Nublar in order to experience dinosaurs they believe they have conquered fits in exactly with the themes of Jurassic Park. When you mention the Hispanic actors in the original 1993 Jurassic Park, you didn't mention that those actors were predominantly playing cheap labor used in handling raptors or maintenance. All of the main characters are predominantly white with, off the top of my head, only two exceptions, a black man and an Asian man, but no Hispanics in the main cast. With a theme involving meddling with nature and arrogance, this kind of makes sense; it portrays arrogant white people traveling to a Central American Island to resurrect dinosaurs because they think they can control nature in the same way that European colonists traveled to other countries convinced they could control the local populations. This theme of attempting to control nature is almost always exclusively seen as a white European problem due to the West's inclination to industrialization and exploitation of nature. The predominantly middle-class white American tourists we see in Jurassic World, to me, is just a further extension on that theme: arrogant white tourists traveling because they want to see the dinosaurs they have tackled and controlled.  With all that being said, I haven't seen Jurassic World, so I can't comment firsthand. However, I did go back and watch the trailer again, and there seem to be at least some Hispanic people as extras in the park, but of course not enough to break the middle-class American family representation."

That's what I meant by ""ground-level staff.""  And it's exactly my point.  I'm not saying that JP had Hispanic representation in the important characters.  What I tried to imply is that at least JP shows a ""realistic"" depiction of labor in North America, where the owners are often American (whatever that means in terms of race) and the ""ground-level"" staff/laborers are often Hispanics.    Just to add to this, there is who seems to be a local Hispanic archaeologist working for the owner (Hammond) in JP, who digs up the amber with mosquitoes (appears in the 2nd scene of the movie).  He unfortunately only has a minute or so of screen time and doesn't appear later, but he might be the Hispanic character depicted with the highest employment position at the park.  Also, mentioned much later in the movie, Hammond's ""gourmet chef"" is called Alejandro.     With a theme involving meddling with nature and arrogance, this kind of makes sense; it portrays arrogant white people traveling to a Central American    Agree with this.  The local archaeologist makes fun of the lawyer in the 2nd scene of the movie, speaking in Spanish that he bets the lawyer will fall in the river since the lawyer is so out-of-place.  The ""arrogant colonizer/extracter"" theme is unmistakeable to me in that scene.    But the thing is, JP does this for us and shows us a bit of this ""dirty underbelly.""

There are a number of reasons I could give for why native Costa Ricans wouldn't work on the island in a hospitality role (racially-biased hiring practices; a fear of the island based on the 1992 disaster; a lack of qualified applicants; Costa Rican employees are likely cheaper and don't fit in with the ""Spare No Expense"" mentality).  I do wish they had at least mentioned it. If they had briefly said something about how they hired exclusively American workers, I think it would've cleared up the issue and even given a little added depth to the park's opulence.

Movies like Jurassic Park and Jurassic World are set in the real world even if they're sci-fi.  They're ""hard sci-fi,"" which is rooted in reality or a realistic depiction of the future.  Since realism is a priority, realistic racial representation is valid.   Movies like Noah are fiction.  A fictional movie IMHO can go two routes - either race is not important because it's a purely fictional world, or race is important because the creator made it important (like Game of Thrones, where Wessos is clearly based on Western Europe and Essos on other ethnicities).  If you go the latter route, the movie ought to respect the creator's intentions - if not, that's whitewashing.  If you go the former route, all bets are off on race.  In that case, the director should be able to cast whomever he wants.    I watched Noah as a ""European conception of the Noah story,"" and thus I was actually glad that everyone was white.  A big reason for this is that the danger for a movie like Noah to cast different races is that you get situations where all the good guys become white and minorities are only cast in ""bad guy"" roles.  My example for this is Lord of the Rings.  Disclosure: I've never read the books, so maybe racial depictions were in the books, in which case my argument here is invalid.  In the LotR movies, all the good guys were white.  Fine, it's a European movie about a medieval fantasy Europe.  But the Uruk-hai looked vaguely sub-Saharan African to me from their noses (I could be wrong, though).  A quick Google search shows Tolkien wrote them to be black-skinned, so that's that and can't fault the movie for that.  But then you had these guys who look kind of Middle Eastern and then these guys who looked Middle Eastern with a sub-Saharan African-looking leader.  Maybe Tolkien wrote them like that so we can't fault the casting of the movies.  But that's clearly an instance of ""good guys white, bad guys colored.""  Noah was all white and thus avoided this issue.  In a ""European conception of the Noah story,"" it would be weird if they cast a few Middle Eastern people just for the crappy or bad characters, because then that shows that the European conception of Middle Eastern people, even back in 6000 BC or whatever, was that they could only be the bad guys.  It's peculiar, but I feel like if you want to make a movie in a fictional world, you have freedom to cast it in your own race.  Of course, it'd be also cool if it could be cast ""post-racially,"" like, without regard to race (like casting a black actor for Hamlet, or Will Smith in Wild Wild West).  But then, often, what we demand in that is something that ""realistically represents society.""  But then, what we're really talking about when we say that is American demographics.  Can we demand American demographics in a Noah movie?  Maybe, maybe not, I'm not sure.    Noah can also go the historical fiction route instead of the above-described ""total fiction"" route.  But if you want to make it historical fiction, you have to cast ALL characters as Middle Eastern.  You shouldn't do like ""70% of the cast will be white but let's make the other 30% Middle Eastern as a token/homage to the setting.""  No, you HAVE TO make it 100% Middle Eastern if you want to depict it in a historical fiction way.  I would have liked to see this movie, but the all-white movie was ok to me because then I understood it as a European/Caucasian story about Noah.  I think I prefer a Caucasian story that's outright Caucasian rather then a Caucasian story that depicts some minorities in the bad guy roles because why not."
TrueFilm,3dcf4f,afewthoughtsonfilm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:30:24 2015 UTC,"so i like this sort of view    Haradrim were supposed to be vaguely middle eastern (but of course Tolkien wasn't writing a ""European conception"" he was self consciously a British myth that his medievalist self saw lacking in real myths). i think a lot of the internet attacks on tolkien go too far but there is a basic orientalizing point."

I admit that my LotR example hangs on the assumption that Tolkien didn't describe those baddie groups with a non-white race.  So if he did, then that example fails (i.e. the ""blame"" goes to Tolkien, not the movie casting).    But it was really jarring for me to see that.  The Uruk-hai I could let pass since they were supposed to be monsters.

TrueFilm,3dcf4f,fuckingwhiteys,9,Wed Jul 15 08:24:09 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting interpretation that I didn't consider.  Thank you.    Jurassic World certainly deliberately is about the ""commercialization"" and ""corporatization"" of dinosaurs, and borrowing from the ""No expense was spared"" line, it would fit that concept to carefully pick the park staff as well.  Jurassic Park, in contrast, is more ""grittier"" in what it shows.  We actually have one of the lead technicians (Samuel Jackson) talking about the headlights of the jeeps not responding to commands and using car batteries when they shouldn't (not exactly your usual Hollywood blockbuster plot), which they bother the lead IT guy (Wayne Knight) about and treat as a real business matter that needs to be taken care of.  There are memorable scenes about dinosaurs not showing up on the tour, the most exciting event on that initial tour is very hard-science-y: an unauthorized field trip observing a sick triceratops and its poop mound that only a paleo-veterinarian could appreciate, and the tour is cut short by rain.  Thus, realistically showing Hispanic workers at the ground-level of the park fits that grittiness and realism.  Jurassic World is the opposite - it had to have been smooth-running because the dialogue actually tells us that ""dinosaurs are no longer exciting"" to people, i.e. people have seen it already, i.e. the park must have already had perhaps millions of visitors since opening.  Jurassic World is so smooth-running, streamlined, and rich that it can afford to pick and choose its ground-level workers if that means its visitors will be happier, or rather, it can do whatever it thinks will make its visitors happier."

TrueFilm,3dcf4f,hstisalive,10,Wed Jul 15 08:20:40 2015 UTC,"That kinda gets into territory I've heard some people discuss--that the commercialism, blandness, and dehumanizing nature of Jurassic World is almost some metacommentary on the film itself. An attempt to avariciously revive something which ought to be allowed to rest.

Jurassic World isn't lazy and patronizing (that can certainly be argued), but the film industry is lazy and patronizing. You see this whenever cultural critics call for diversity in film. They don't call the film, or the filmmakers racist, they call the film industry at large racist. Those who do call the film or filmmakers racist immediately focus their attention towards the film industry. This suggests it's less productive to talk about an individual film's homogenous cast than it is to talk about the circumstances of the industry it was made in.  As a Hispanic, I did think it was strange there were no Hispanic extras in Jurassic World but it didn't bother me in the same way it bothered you. You can be bothered by it, of course. I just don't think it's a criticism of the film, especially one like Jurassic World. You could extend it so easily to other films. Girls got a lot of flack for how white its main cast was. Her got a lot of flack for portraying a ""gentrified"" L.A., never mind the fact it was filmed in Shanghai. There were no Hispanic extras in The Avengers.

It's that simple. There should be natives hovering in this film -- not least because the entire franchise is premised on the misdeeds of capitalist exploitation, which are as important to the choice of locale for these theme parks as they are to the experiments themselves. This is not coming out of left field. This is a part of the theme, and it has been since the beginning; Spielberg certainly noticed it.  2) If you think race has no place in discussions of aesthetics, that it's only ""political"" and has no bearing on questions of quality, please kindly revisit your history of aesthetics. Revisit the Enlightenment. You'll find it difficult to argue that the theories of aesthetics founded there are not deeply imbricated with questions of race, nationhood, class (specifically, anti-working class), gender, etc. You'll have a hard time proving that artistic taste-making, for example, did not depend on specific ideas about national, class and racial superiority. Yes, bourgeoisie, I'm talking about you.  What you call ""aesthetic,"" contra politics, has always been and always will be political."
TrueFilm,3dcf4f,TerminallyCapriSun,3,Wed Jul 15 12:52:09 2015 UTC,Hollywood just made a movie set in Hawaii with like no asian people in it.  They even let a white person play an asian character.  White people are why there are no hispanic people in JW.  White people.
TrueFilm,3dcf4f,Tilting_Gambit,2,Wed Jul 15 13:10:00 2015 UTC,"I went to film school and I always have a respect, but frustration, with discussions of race as it related to content. There is always a broach in study between the cultural and artistic impact between the teachings. I almost always enjoy the artistic discussion of film, but I am well aware of the import of the cultural aesthetic.   I think you are very nearly getting into pot stirring by asking, ""Where are the Hispanic people"" instead of ""Does it bother you that JW doesn't have a realistic representation of modern demographics."" Not saying this is intentional, but as someone pointed out, this would be ripped to shreds over on /r/movies   I think there is valid point that there is a lack of Hispanic actors, especially in contrast to the 93 film, but I wouldn't call it an error of omission. Should Universal release another blockbuster with this problem, then its a social issue.   I'll say that while I appreciate your discomfort in the lack of representation, I would say I think that in a fairly innocuous film in terms of social messaging (it has sins, but it's also popcorn).  If you are disturbed by a lack of representation that fits your worldview or life, you are missing the purpose of art in general. If you become disturbed by a  a film that fits your worldview, then you are in danger of imposing your will on the artist.   Finally, it's also a bit aggressive to suggest this is ""Whitewashing"" and not simply casting based on merit. Race has little factor in this film (opposed to your example,  21, which heinously flipped the race of the lead). Is it wrong for Attack on Titan's feature film to star Japanese actors when in the Anime series, it's a Euro-Caucasian world (hence the German last names, hair, and facial arctypes)? This seems like a mild potshot against the (dwindling) racial majority of the country which produced the film.   I will be opposed anytime the identity of a person is changed to befit business decisions; however, it seems to me that this film, which was given ... ahem universal ly mediocre reviews by critics and is smashing records the box office, would have somehow cast white people solely to boost profits or prevent losses caused by casting a POC in a lead (or other role)."
TrueFilm,3dcf4f,TerminallyCapriSun,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:09 2015 UTC,"It says something about the artist more than anything, or artists as the case may be. The bigger the project, the easier it'll be for some of these things to fall through the cracks.  Who was in charge of casting extras? Or rather, who was in charge of hiring the people who hired the extras? If you make a movie, and your basic instinct is to just cast all white people, it says something about you and the kind of art you are making.  If it's unconscious, like Jurassic Park, that means that the artist's idea of what's natural in terms of mise-en-scene is a fairly Caucasian background.  That's the norm.  For most people, this isn't the norm, so when you see it in Jurassic Park, it stands out.  There's dinosaurs, but no lower income/minority people.  This is jarring, but only because it's not a plot point, it's assumed.  A modern audience, if they see a dinosaur park full of white people, they're gonna want to know why it's all white people. It's not that that's a problem, but it begs explanation. It takes you out of the scene and breaks the illusion if it's not addressed, which is obviously something you don't want.  Now let's say you set it in the '50s, but instead of all clean cut white people, most of the attendants are Mexican farm laborers on their day off, you'd be asking: wtf, what are all these braceros doing at the Dinosaur Park, what is it about dinosaurs that's so appealing to Mexicans? What is it about dinosaurs and Mexicans? Where does the connection lie?? I want to know! Reveal the mysteries! And if the film continued on like that without addressing the over-representation of Mexicans in the park, it would be REALLY weird.  In this day and age, not having a cast of background workers who reflect the makeup of the actual population is jarring. It's the exact equivalent from an audience perspective, at least from an audience, like most, who haven't spent their entire life around white/privileged people.  It's not that I think the film makers are racist: they just overlooked something major, same reason any film fails, and it ended up breaking the illusion.  I'm not talking about star actors. Obviously the stars have to be able to market the film or there is no film, so that choice is being heavily narrowed down for the artist by the audience.  And yes, white actors are just definitively more marketable than any other race. Not just among white people, but among all races, globally.  There are a lot of reasons for this, but they don't really matter when marketing a film. So I don't blame Universal for casting Chris Pratt, because they didn't really cast Chris Pratt, the numbers cast Chris Pratt. Plus, I like Chris Pratt fine, it's one of the cases where the numbers and analytics did well.    The background casting was definitely not a marketing ploy, you can be sure of that.  It was a creative decision, or a creative oversight, depending on your perspective, and if they'd been trying to make it as marketable as possible, they would have included more minority extras.  But going back to illusion, if the background people had looked a little more like the people you see in everyday life, I'm pretty certain I would have enjoyed the film a lot more.  It's because the Park doesn't feel alive: it doesn't feel like a space that people are spending time in, that's part of the cultural moment in which the film takes place. It's just constantly reminding you that it's doing a color by numbers remake of what made the 93 film successful, except they don't really get what made that film engrossing.   But the thing you say about merit seems dubious. You went to film school. You've probably been around actors.  I could probably find a better actor for almost any given role in almost any given film for a fraction of the price the studio paid for who they cast.  But that's not what casting is about. It's a form of branding.  There are thousands and thousands of gifted, talented actors out there, and only a handful of them working regularly in film. Also, race is one of the most important factors in casting, contrary to what you suggest.  Anyone who's worked as an actor on a liminal level or gone to acting academy will tell you the same thing.  When they are casting new people/unknowns, they are only trying to find a particular look.  There's never a case in which a Pakistani guy just blows everyone away and casting decides, ""oh we should change the character to a Pakistani guy."" No.  Same with white people.  I had a friend audition in front of some casting directors back in the day, and he was by far the most experienced, had the looks, could do Shakespeare as well as East Enders.  But the casting directors were looking for a Pakistani-looking person.  They didn't say that going in, but the only guy to get signed out of that was the one Pakistani guy, who also just happened to be one of the worst actors in the group, by popular and academic consensus.  He had the right look for the part though. On a higher marketing level obviously, specific actors are associated with specific markets.  Someone like Chris Pratt tests real well with men and women, which is fairly rare, and he can hold down a leading role as long as the tone is light. It's not because he's great at acting. He basically plays himself, and people like his personality.  He has natural screen presence, I'm not saying he's talentless, but it's not like he's some kind of acting force of nature.  He's the most marketable guy for the part which is why he got it, and why despite being a shitty movie, Jurassic Park still sells.  He was perhaps the main marketing draw.  Then they have one really talented actor, D'inofrio, who elevates the tone a little bit.  But his talent is a marketing tool in itself: like Heisenberg in Godzilla or Paul Giamatti in a bunch of things. They add a huge amount of credibility to every level of the project from production to marketing, not to mention they make it so that old people don't all complain as loudly about decaying standards."

They're all obsessed with control, order versus chaos, trying to make the rules and maintain order so they don't devolve.  And indeed that's what Tom does the whole film. He spends the whole film ""chasing his hat,"" trying to restore balance and order to Leo's empire. At the start of the film, he's Leo's right-hand man in the most influential gang in the city. He's then of course expelled from his position, forced to go to Caspar and manipulate the Italians, deal with Verna, the Dane, and Bernie, as well as constantly put up with his gambling debt with Lazar. The calm and collected man in the opening scene slowly dissolves into one with his head barely above water struggling to breathe. At the end of course, at the cost of Leo and Verna, in the closing shot when they leave him he puts his hat back on firmly in place. He's again in a place of control, after spending the whole film getting beaten up and trusted/suspected by both games.  (This is really quick and dirty, I'll try and edit in more to the post later as thoughts come to me, especially about the privacy angle. It's one of my all-time favorites but it's not discussed a lot, so I jumped at the chance to chime in).  Edit: Alright, going to try and tackle the privacy angle. I skipped around the film a little to refresh my memory even though I didn't have time to sit down and watch the whole thing. The first thing I want to mention is the most obvious: fundamentally, a hat is just an item that covers one's head. This obviously lends itself well to becoming a symbol when paired with Tom Reagan as our protagonist. Indeed, he's an extraordinarily complex character with motivations that are anything but clear. He's full of contradictions too; in the first portion of the film he twice mentions doing things for a reason, but by the end of the film he's done a complete 180 and says he doesn't always know why he does things. He's very guarded about his motivations. Obviously it helps him in infiltrating Caspar's gang to restore Leo to power; that just comes with the territory given his career. But he holds everyone, even Leo, at arm's length, never letting anyone get too close. The hat and his chasing it are symbolic of his need for privacy, for no one to know what he's about to do, or, perhaps most crucially, how he's feeling.  Consider this: The Dane, Bernie, Mink, and there are strong hints that perhaps Caspar as well, are all homosexual. In the context of the movie then, is it that far out of the question to think that Tom might be too? He goes to extraordinarily far lengths to help Leo, even after Leo flat out refused to listen to him and then beat him, embarrassed him, and expelled him from his employ. Sure, he sleeps with Verna, but does he love her? Why didn't he kill Bernie the first time? When the film ends, Tom's efforts have succeeded and he's once again in Leo's favor, but Leo's chosen to marry Verna. Tom then refuses to work for him again, and again he places the hat firmly on his head. His feelings are unknown to Leo, and to us.  Of course, the film lends itself to other readings as well. It could just be that Tom did all of this because, as the film repeats to us from the beginning, he has what Bernie doesn't: ethics. The Coens envisioned the movie with 2 love triangles, a heterosexual one and a homosexual one, which we of course do get in the film. So perhaps, Tom sacrifices for Leo's sins, (the Jesus allusion is the film's most obvious symbolism), because he has a strong sense of loyalty and ethics, doing what's right for his boss. And at the end, he leaves because having settled it, he won't work for Leo after his ""lack"" of ethics.  But of course we don't know, Tom's true motivations aren't ever explicitly denoted. They exist in his mind, which rests comfortably and securely inside of his hat. The film has so many readings and so much symbolism, it's really incredible. Absolutely one of my favorites."
TrueFilm,3dcnf2,TempSpastic,7,Wed Jul 15 12:43:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I've given this a bit of thought.  I think the hat is a symbol for life. A man's life. There's nothing more foolish than a man scrambling and scrabbling to save his own skin. Tom gambles away his hat and is given it back by Verna. She is the one who loves him, and offers him his life in the first place - the mother/whore I suppose.  Note Tom loses his hat when he's taken to the forest to be shot - and he throws up. This is when he is face to face with death and has nowhere left to run.  Basically Tom is a true nihilist hero - he'll wear his hat, and play to stay in the game, but he's not in it to win, or to lose, just to keep playing. He knows love, marriage, the comforts of the world are an illusion and he shuns them, unlike Leo, who needs to believe in love.  The opening scene - the hat blowing in the wind, doesn't occur in the movie and is just thematic - we are the mercy of the fates and we're fools to believe otherwise (hnce the gambling). The last scene is Tom turning his back on the comforting lie and facing his reality. Thematically identical to the end of Force Majeur! also, totally stolen from the end of 'The Third Man'!  Anyhows, those are my thoughts on Tom Reagan's hat."

TrueFilm,3dcnf2,UncleRev,3,Wed Jul 15 14:28:25 2015 UTC,"I thought the hat blowing through the forest was just a lyrical, dreamlike image, and that its various appearances were just a repeated gag. From interviews I've seen, the Coen Brothers are reticent to construct symbols in their films. For instance, they stated outright that the cat in Inside Llewyn Davis doesn't symbolize anything and was just included to make the movie more lively. And both The Big Lebowski and Barton Fink are full of teasing symbolic resonances which purposefully don't add up to anything, embracing mystery and ineffability instead (see A Serious Man for more Coen Bros. work on this theme). Of course, we don't have to take the Coen Brothers at their word, but for me the hat was just a hat."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,ajvenigalla,106,Tue Jul 14 15:36:09 2015 UTC,"I too liked the film, but I don't like telling anyone who disagrees with me that they ""missed the point."" Some people I respect very much got the point, but still didn't like it. The allegorical power of the film didn't overcome their view of its narrow-mindedness or they didn't like getting hit over the head with the message every step of the way. I think their opinions are valid. I just disagree.  Its success to me was definitely its simplicity. This may be the reason that some disliked it, but I love movies with narrow and rigid focus on one objective. As long as the filmmakers succeed in accomplishing the goal they set out to reach and don't 'cheat' to get there, I'm usually a pretty big fan. It's the reason I like Key Largo, Point Blank, The Day of the Jackal, Purple Noon, Jurassic Park, etc. Those films set out to do one thing right, with single-minded intensity, and knock it out of the park.  Also, Tilda Swinton's performance is one of the best of her career."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,Deviator77,14,Tue Jul 14 16:27:33 2015 UTC,"I'm curious as to what you, as a person who liked the movie, think the allegory is. I don't remember the movie too well, but I remember thinking that the metaphor (rather than the plot) was too simple a take on the world and that it didn't work well even within its unambitious scope.   (The interesting production design did definitely entertain me, so, I didn't think it was terrible.)"
TrueFilm,3d9idl,iamiamwhoami,2,Tue Jul 14 19:50:19 2015 UTC,Would you mind explaining your perception of the allegory?
TrueFilm,3d9idl,BrainSlurper,12,Tue Jul 14 21:24:12 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure the movie deadpan explains the allegory multiple times. The first time by the fish tank thing and again at the end, IIRC"
TrueFilm,3d9idl,dkinmn,6,Tue Jul 14 22:26:37 2015 UTC,"Indeed.   I think the script was pretty terrible because of it. It looked great, it was a unique-ish film, but if you read the script without the visual, it'd reveal itself to be pretty bad."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,BrainSlurper,2,Wed Jul 15 01:09:07 2015 UTC,"It was an action movie with pretty inventive fight scenes. The problem is when people start saying it is some super deep social commentary, it gives people the expectation that it is a better movie than it is."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,ojajaja,6,Wed Jul 15 01:23:21 2015 UTC,I think Snowpiercer and the 'society' within Snowpiercer should be examined as an isolated system itself since it is an unrealistic closed system. It's silly to make any comparisons to our real world because our society simply doesnt work like that (as much as people like to rage about classism and the 99% in real life).
TrueFilm,3d9idl,piyochama,2,Wed Jul 15 03:07:03 2015 UTC,"It helps to remember that the underlying material is extremely one-track-minded (it was meant to be Marxist IIRC).  I too think it was a masterpiece. That being said, I don't think the film was meant to be that deep."

TrueFilm,3d9idl,PastyPilgrim,38,Fri Jul 17 07:32:00 2015 UTC,"I'm really happy when movies like Snowpiercer come around because they're so justly divisive. Perception and reception are so important to a movie's critical and social response that it's nice to have a movie that you really don't know what to expect when going into it.  When a movie is generally hailed as being excellent, so many people will crawl out of the woodworks to nitpick details or make pedantic comments just to 'prove' others wrong (or relish in their own, superior intelligence and taste). When you have movies that some would consider a masterpiece, and can make many valid arguments for that to be the case, whilst others would consider them uninspired trash, also with many valid arguments, then you have a true 'edgy' film.  Edginess is all the rage in film right now but it's usually so contrived. Snowpiercer was so piercing (hue hue hue) in its edginess that we're constantly debating whether it's shit or a masterpiece. Think about that. We're not judging whether it's great or timeless, nor whether it's mediocre or good, nor whether it's bad or trash; we're judging whether it's a masterpiece or destined for the incinerator. That's such an interesting situation if you ask me."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,missch4nandlerbong,18,Tue Jul 14 19:33:25 2015 UTC,"I'm on board with almost all of that, but I can't fathom how anyone could seriously claim that it's a masterpiece."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,thefablemuncher,7,Tue Jul 14 23:20:05 2015 UTC,"And I can't fathom how anyone wasn't swept up in its unique setting and fast-paced action. I mean, I can, but it's one of the things that makes this film so divisive. Quite a lot of people really can't get past the whole concept of a perpetually-moving train and tend to pick apart about how it makes no sense. They know it's a sci-fi film yet most of the people who really disliked the film have a really difficult time accepting the entire logic (or non-logic) of the train.  Meanwhile I've seen the film twice and I think a perpetually-moving train in the middle of a frozen wasteland is one of the coolest things I've ever seen in any film. My favourite scene is the classroom scene, which is constantly pointed out as one of the stupidest scenes in the entire movie.  Nearly all the criticism that naysayers have about this film are things that I just didn't have any problem with whatsoever. Not once in the entire film did I feel that they were needlessly hitting us over the head with its message. It was never preachy nor overbearing for me. It was a simple story of the disenfranchised rising up to take control of the system that was rigged to keep them in their place. They revolt, action and violence ensue, the train's history gets explained, they reach the front and end up destroying the entire system instead. It's a simple story that was executed with so much excitement, creativity, thrills, and drama. I loved every minute of this film.  At the end of the day it simply wasn't for everybody. Even some open-minded filmgoers who don't demand a strict narrative logic greatly disliked the film, so it really is quite interesting to see such wildly different opinions."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,latarian,3,Wed Jul 15 02:48:10 2015 UTC,"Me too. I'm more interested by the fact that people considered anything in that film good acting (minus Tilda Swinton and Alison PIll) I found Chris Evan's scene to be laughably bad. Sincerely, for me, good acting is when it makes me feel something and feels honest. To watch Chris Evans mumble through his monologue with a put on, lazy, ""PTSD"" sort of feel made me want to laugh. I for sure get what he was trying to do, but I just don't think he had the chops to pull it off. I've seen others pull off that emptyness quite beautifully but he didn't do it for me.   With regards to the rest of the film, maybe I don't get it. That's fine, I don't have to get it. There's lots of films I initially don't fully understand because of the depth to them ; Killing them softly, Under the Skin, A Serious Man. These are some of my favorite films that I have no problem admitting that I've had to come here and look up stuff to do with them because it went over my head. That isn't to say they didn't have me hooked from the get go.  I will say that my main criticism of this film was the acting, as it was the responsibility of the actors to not phone it in and I felt like most of them did. If the acting was better I probably would have enjoyed it more, but there are other things from when I remember watching it that made no sense to me."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,jupiterkansas,3,Wed Jul 15 03:37:04 2015 UTC,"I doubt the actors were just phoning it in, but so much of performance depends on circumstances, understanding, editing, direction the careful construction of those character moments, and a good character focused script that it's always hard to pinpoint where things go wrong."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,latarian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:08:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I fully agree with that to be honest. It was just weak. Ed Harris is a seasoned veteran, there's no reason that he should be doing a crappy job. I feel like there was no passion for that project for him."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,jupiterkansas,5,Wed Jul 15 05:10:50 2015 UTC,"I think he had the toughest role in the film, and was basically playing it the way he did in Truman Show. It was all expository dialogue, with almost no room to move on the set, no real backstory to draw from, and no way for the audience to identify with him. He did good with what he had to work with, which was a one dimensional character that supposed to be omnipotent, or at least falsely omnipotent.   Imagine watching Willy Wonka but you only meet Willy Wonka at the very end of the movie. How hard would it be to play that part and make it work?"

TrueFilm,3d9idl,PastyPilgrim,2,Wed Jul 15 02:07:08 2015 UTC,"I understand that. I was speaking from my experience of seeing a thread or comment calling it a masterpiece several times a month, at least. And at the same time, I encounter many people saying the opposite. This movie in particular is mostly irrelevant to my point, however. It just happens to be the movie under discussion when I thought of the idea."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,jupiterkansas,30,Wed Jul 15 03:09:39 2015 UTC,"Please allow me to criticize, because I'm not a fan of the film.   First off, I didn't think it was allegorical as much as it was satirical - in the same way that Brazil or Bunuel is satirical - but the only person who seemed to really get the joke was Tilda Swinton (and to a lesser extent, the school teacher). She delivered a perfect performance for this story, and if everyone had matched her level of flamboyance, the movie might have actually worked. But as simply a metaphor, it was not only obvious and blunt, but the deadly seriousness of everything and everyone involved was just dull.   Also, being allegorical doesn't excuse a film from being logical. If the filmmaker didn't want us to criticize such a preposterous premise, why go through all the effort of concocting such an preposterous and overly elaborate premise to begin with? Saying it's an allegory doesn't make it any less ridiculous, and won't stop me from questioning the logic of the situation. The premise alone is what pushes the film toward satire, and if the filmmakers had fully embraced that it might have worked. Trying to make a smart and stylish action movie out of it was, in my opinion, the wrong choice."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,RidiculousSideburns,16,Tue Jul 14 19:33:00 2015 UTC,"Yes! The tone is one of the reasons I disliked the movie. I watched the first half of the movie thinking it was a kind of self aware B flick (Tilda Swanson, the frozen arm, shoe on the head). Then a shift occurred and it felt like the movie wanted me to suddenly empathize with Chris Evans eating babies and take its class warfare narrative seriously. It was just very jarring to me as a viewer."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,jupiterkansas,5,Tue Jul 14 22:52:29 2015 UTC,"The frozen arm scene definitely set the tone for the film, but it didn't stick with that tone. Other people have excused that saying that's how Korean films are, but I'd argue that's a problem with lots of Korean films, esp. Bong Joon-ho's."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,real_lame,3,Wed Jul 15 05:12:16 2015 UTC,"I agree that it went halfway to Brazil. The school teacher is a good example. The New Year scene in the middle of a battle also gave off a similar satirical over the top feel. I think to a lesser extent the trees and aquarium, with the fast and conveniently placed sushi bar contrasted enough with the initial struggle to stand out. Looking back, I missed a lot of the satire the first time through and if it had been a bit more obviously satirical I think I may have enjoyed it more. However, I may have just not been in on the joke while others got it like you did."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,jupiterkansas,3,Wed Jul 15 05:35:28 2015 UTC,I don't think you missed a lot of the satire. The satire isn't there. It should be satire but it isn't.
TrueFilm,3d9idl,JerryPayton,64,Wed Jul 15 05:57:12 2015 UTC,"Snowpiercer was one of the truly disappointing moviegoing experiences I've ever had. The conceit was awful. The allegory about class warfare and social inequality was embarassingly on the nose. But mostly I had trouble with the train.  The train layout makes absolutely zero sense, which is a major issue when 99% of the movie consists of the rebels traversing it. The only possible explanation is that the train must have been designed by a screenwriter. The train cars are just a collection of episodes - instead of having a logical progression, the writer just plops whatever scenario that strikes his/her fancy. Need a break after a big battle? Here's a sushi bar. Need a pick-me-up after an expository classroom scene? Here's a nightclub/opium den. I guess whoever designed the train didn't find it a big deal that the children must travel through an opium den on their way to classes every morning. The sequential nature of train cars was supposed to be a propulsive force, leaving the characters with nowhere to go but forward. Instead, it comes across as exposing the nuts and bolts of a lazy script for all to see. If seeing an action movie is equivalent to riding Space Mountain, then Snowpiercer would be getting stuck on the ride with the lights turned on, the rickety structure supporting the flash and show laid bare.  Beyond that, the ""twists"" at the end fell completely flat. Why would the Overseer need to foment rebellion to cut down population? Why would the Overseer need to keep a caboose full of dirty have-nots? Maybe he needs the children's slight hands to keep the train going. But then why would a man of endless resources with the foresight to build a perpetual-motion train that circles a track that spans the entire globe and is able to be self-sufficient with its population, fail to notice that flaw in the design? This is where the motivations hit a point of reflexivity where things only happen because the plot demands it. The Overseer creates protein bars to nurture a subset of the population that he will later demand be cut by 74% in order to preserve the resources on the train.   And lastly, the ending. A polar bear in the snow is supposed to be a glimmering beacon of hope for life on Earth, as if there had been any climate shift in global history has been enough to extinguish every last life form on the planet. Not to mention at the end of it all, it's two kids left to fend for themselves on a frozen landscape. Some hope, indeed."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,poliphilo,32,Tue Jul 14 18:22:52 2015 UTC,"I like the form of this critique, because I definitely like it when the world seems to have a meaningful logic that reflects some kind of reality of the situation. But I think many of the specifics you mention aren't right. See this diagram of the train (or the source graphic novel).   Need a break after a big battle? Here's a sushi bar.   The sushi bar is right next to the aquarium, which is in turn next to the water supply.    Need a pick-me-up after an expository classroom scene? Here's a nightclub/opium den. I guess whoever designed the train didn't find it a big deal that the children must travel through an opium den on their way to classes every morning.    No, the classroom is adjacent to the ""guestroom"" section where the upper-class people live. The opium den is all the way on the other side of the guestroom sections, past the sauna and nightclub.   Why would the Overseer need to foment rebellion to cut down population?   I'm not clear on this (important) point.   Why would the Overseer need to keep a caboose full of dirty have-nots?   Well, at the time of the crisis, it seemed humane to not let those people die (even though they hadn't bought a ticket). Later on, it was inhumane to kill them,... plus, yes,... the Overseer needed the children's hands.    But then why would a man of endless resources with the foresight to build a perpetual-motion train that circles a track that spans the entire globe and is able to be self-sufficient with its population, fail to notice that flaw in the design?   It seems more likely that no matter how good the engineering is, there's some flaw in operating a moving machine for 10+ years, especially given that they can't stop for maintenance and they only have the tools and components they kept on board.   Not to mention at the end of it all, it's two kids left to fend for themselves on a frozen landscape. Some hope, indeed.   I read it the same way, and it seemed to be a totally and deliberately ambiguous moment: some hope, but not really all that much. It's not the sort of ending where they come out to a beautiful meadow with sun dappled fruit trees, but instead an icy wasteland where the one clear sign of life is a predator of humans!"
TrueFilm,3d9idl,Dark1000,4,Tue Jul 14 19:49:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't care for the film too much, but this is the kind of criticism that I don't find particularly useful. Why does the train itself need to make physical sense? It's clearly an allegorical space that the characters travel through, not a real train. It has to make sense in how it sets up the allegory and how it reflects human society, not how a life-sustaining, perpetual motion train would logically work (it wouldn't)."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,poliphilo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:29:49 2015 UTC,"I basically agree with u/bearses above, but I'll go a bit further.  I think usually an allegory is interesting because the stuff that happens to the actual concrete people & the choices they make shed light on the abstractions or generalities those people are stand-ins for.   For example, if someone is shot in a movie, we could say, oh: ""this is about the death or injury of X, the concept that that person represents, and that's more vivid or meaningful to me because I can compare it to my feelings about this person."" But if the bullet sort of bounces off them for no particular reason, then the concrete reality and the characters' actions are lost or mooted. There may still be a coherent symbolic meaning, but the movie now reduced to a coding exercise. One of the most important tools (leveraging our reactions to concrete reality to give us insight into the allegorical meaning) is lost.  I partly agree in that the concrete reality only needs to be coherent and ""credible"" to a point—basically the point at which characters' situations, choices, reactions make sense upon reflection. A Star Trek movie can be perfectly fine at discussing symbolically Chernobyl, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the military-industrial complex, etc. without necessarily delving into the intricacies of exactly how warp drives work (they probably wouldn't). The key thing is usually that we understand the character's situation and the key choices they have to make.  Applying that to Snowpiercer, I think sociological questions like ""how does the school work?"", ""how do people entertain themselves?"", ""what do various people get to eat?"", ""how are the tailies alive?"" are of very high importance. I don't think we sufficiently understand the choices presented to Curtis—destroy the system? keep it and rule it?—without having a sense of how that part of the train works as a society. I wouldn't get nearly as much out of it if the choice presented was only presented abstractly: ""Curtis, do you want to be the owner of the means of production?"" or ""do you want to live like the 1%?"", because it's very tough to know what those things really mean. A logical train layout (which I found admirably and beautifully clear in the movie) is very (albeit indirectly) helpful.  The ""pure"" physics matters less, but some aspects do matter. It is an action movie, and like most action movies is substantially about how determination and physical finesse with machines (guns, vehicles) can overcome preexisting power imbalances. So the physics matters when it's relevant to the characters: the ""dark"" scene when passing through a tunnel, the car-to-car shoot-out, the vulnerability of their train/society to a single explosive, etc."

TrueFilm,3d9idl,iamiamwhoami,13,Wed Jul 15 21:15:11 2015 UTC,"This movie really appealed to me as a complex systems scientists. What I really like about it is that it's not just an allegory of class warfare and social inequality. It's a film about social ecosystems. I feel like the first 20 mins make you think that it's going to be about class warfare. I remember rolling my eyes and thinking ""Okay I get it"". But then I realized it's so much more than that. It's about how we as living creatures expand to fill every social and ecological niche available to us. The movie magnifies this concept by shrinking the ecosystem of our entire planet down to the few dozen cars of a train. The allegory is about how our ecological and social ecosystems need to maintain homeostasis to survive. I don't think he portrays the struggle between rich and poor as one of righteousness. He portrays it as something necessary in order to keep our society intact. Much the same way forest fires help keep woodland ecosystems intact."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,NeMajaYo,10,Tue Jul 14 21:42:42 2015 UTC,I'm glad someone else agrees.  I really thought it was overrated.  The dialog was stiff. The themes were pretentious.   I had a hard time watching it.
TrueFilm,3d9idl,PrecisionEsports,7,Tue Jul 14 22:32:01 2015 UTC,"I don't have a particular issue with your enjoyment of the film, but a lot of your flak in the film seems really specific and wasted. The train cars follow a pretty simple logic of going poor-rich, powerless-powerful. As someone else mentioned, no kids were going through Opium dens and sushi was near the water/fish. So... those seem like 'missing the point' complaints, as much as I dislike using that phrase. As far as the Overseer points. Again, seems pretty straight forward. Population control and workers.   For the last bit with the hope. Do you recall the journey of our open minded side character? How he told his child to look through the glass and see a world without bias? The SnowPiercer slams through the world, blindly holding onto its plans and hopes from the past, locking all passengers into their logic. Seems fitting that they would escape into a 'pure' white landscape.   TLDR: Everyone I see who dislikes this movie has talked about logical flaws they see, but the film wasn't aiming to be logical in all fronts. You can dislike it, but every complaint I've read seems like complaining that the Horse could talk in 101 Dalmations. Not really an important aspect of the film."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,jupiterkansas,3,Wed Jul 15 02:52:55 2015 UTC,"The thing people forget about suspension of disbelief is that the audience doesn't give it willingly. The filmmaker has to cleverly and craftily coax suspension of disbelief out of an audience. The have to make them believe. They can't simply expect them to overlook a story's illlogical points.   When Superman came out, the tag line was ""You will believe a man can fly.""  They weren't asking you to suspend your disbelief. They were saying that the filmmaking was so effective, you'll believe it's true even though it's unbelievable.   Snowpiercer doesn't do that. It simply gives you a preposterous scenario, and begs for you to suspend disblief. That's just not how stories work."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,PrecisionEsports,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:29:59 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that this is likely the point of devision among opinions. I think BJH is a smart director though, and trusts in an audience to follow. This is the guy that made The Host after all. So personally that 'flaw' is on the viewer, not the director, and the viewer has no right to impose that quality on the film.  Ehh... I can't word that properly, its late. Basically, I think BJH did the film he wanted to do and that it was done to a fantastic level. Some people can't buy into the world,  caring about where the food comes from and where the poop goes. Or disliking the blunt nature of it. Both of those are fine, but those are very personal issues that have little to do with what the film was. I didn't expect Jurrasic World to deliver anything but what Jurrasic World wanted to deliver."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,jupiterkansas,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:50:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big fan of The Host either. It starts with a bang but ends with a whimper. However, The Host succeeds at suspension of disbelief.   But he certainly made the film he wanted to make. I have no problem with that. After all, I gave him the honor of watching Snowpiercer, and I will watch his next film, because even if I don't like it, he's an interesting filmmaker. That's more respect than I'll give to Jurassic World, because I know exactly what Jurassic World will deliver, and it's not interesting."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,PrecisionEsports,2,Wed Jul 15 06:07:28 2015 UTC,"I will watch his next film, because even if I don't like it, he's an interesting filmmaker.    That is always a successful film in my books. :)   I know exactly what Jurassic World will deliver   If you guessed 'woman outruns a T-rex in high heels with no head start', well you would be right. Oh it is gloriously horrible, but in a good way if your in the mood."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,jupiterkansas,2,Wed Jul 15 06:18:58 2015 UTC,I put Snowpiercer in the gloriously horrible category. Things like Jurassic World are just insulting.
TrueFilm,3d9idl,PrecisionEsports,3,Wed Jul 15 06:20:25 2015 UTC,"I was going to leave this comment alone, so feel free to ignore the following if you want. <3   The view your portrating here is very 'film elitist' for lack of a better word. As much as you think Jurassic World is insulting, the film did what it aimed to do. I shot on Transformers because of the lack of logic and story that is more madlib than writing. Jurassic World though? They understood what people wanted and designed a nice tong in cheek sequel buster that delivers everything you want from that kind of film. Not every film must be Citizen Kane to be respectable.   That all said, I get where your coming from."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,jupiterkansas,2,Wed Jul 15 20:41:52 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Jurassic World delivers exactly what it promises, and I would be pleasantly surprised if it delivered more than that. However, I simply have no interest in what it promises. That's a personal thing. It just doesn't appeal to me. It's the same reason I've never watched a Michael Bay movie.   If not wanting to see another CGI dinosaur movie makes me elitist, then I guess that's what I am."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,PrecisionEsports,2,Wed Jul 15 22:03:35 2015 UTC,"Naw I'm with ya. Just the way you phrased it was the issue that popped into my head. All good.  On the flip, Michael Bay has made some really good films. Bad Boys is about as good as that genre can be, and Pain & Gain sits right beside Wolf of Wallstreet in quality for me. Different audience, more popcorn fun, but equally executed and interesting."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,JerryPayton,2,Wed Jul 15 22:25:05 2015 UTC,"It's amusing that you dismiss my criticism that the train was structured like a formulaic screenplay with ""the sushi bar was near the water tank,"" and then claim I'm the one missing the point."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,PrecisionEsports,2,Wed Jul 15 18:56:09 2015 UTC,"I was just touching on the points others mentioned. You dismissed the logic and there was a logic. I could understand the complaint about the screenplay, but that is hardly a negative given the blunt nature of the film."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,JerryPayton,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:03:10 2015 UTC,"Since you found the movie's logic so straightforward, and everyone who disagrees with you as missing the point, perhaps you can answer this for me in detail, without using the phrase ""like someone else said.""   Can you explain why the Overseer would create protein bars to feed a subset of the population that he views as an unnecessary drain on resources? Or why he created those protein bars so the lower-class wouldn't resort to cannibalism, which would alleviate the strain on resources? Can you explain why he chose to use a saboteur to start a rebellion when his guards have the power to enter the caboose section and remove children from their parents as they wish? Or why he wanted this rebellion to start when the protein bars were being delivered, the withholding of which would create the same effect of population control? Why not just have his guards massacre the population, which is what he elects to do anyway after the rebellion ""succeeds?"" Can you explain why he maintains a lower-class section that is 4x as populated as he wishes it to be, all so he can pluck a child or two every once in a while?  This scheme by the Overseer - instigating a rebellion to cull population - is the animating action of the plot. If it does not make sense in any logical regard, then you must admit the premise of the film is bullshit. The Overseer chooses to manage population through a sham rebellion instead of other, easier methods and the end result is he gets killed and the train destroyed. So now we have a shoddy premise, lazy script, bald allegory, and an inept villain. You may have enjoyed the film for any number of reasons, but certainly you can't hold it against the people who disliked the film because the entire plot was bullshit from the jump."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,PrecisionEsports,2,Wed Jul 15 19:44:49 2015 UTC,"I said 'as someone else mentioned' specifically because someone already replied to your points in abother comment in this chain. What the issue be?  Same deal with the rest of this. You are expecting the Overseer to become Hitler and anything less doesn't make sense? Genocide is usually considered a bad thing. Not sure why that is an issue for you. Like I said, it's a blunt object of a film. If you want gas chambers and 'logic' of that kind then you are likely missing the point of this film."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,JerryPayton,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"I wanted to see if you had any thoughts of your own on the film, or if you're just here to reassure yourself that the film is good by dismissing any dissenting opinion as ""missing the point"" of the film. That question appears to have been answered."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,PrecisionEsports,2,Wed Jul 15 20:58:46 2015 UTC,"I'm at work and on my cell. I can't just take an hour to sit down and handhold you through the process. Sorry.  I feel like all your issues relate to logistics about the train, or lack of bare faced genocide. Neither is important to the film or expected of the film. I did agree that the writing is weak in areas and that you rightfully can take issue with that. Not sure what else you need, outside of a grade school PowerPoint explaining allegory and themes."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,Lilusa,14,Wed Jul 15 21:41:47 2015 UTC,"I guess whoever designed the train didn't find it a big deal that the children must travel through an opium den on their way to classes every morning.    Here is a map of the train: https://brentofthefabulouswild.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/snowpiercer-10-train-section-map.jpg  The children definitely do not need to be anywhere near the drug den...all the food cars are next to each other and the club/opium den are way near the engine.   But then why would a man of endless resources with the foresight to build a perpetual-motion train that circles a track that spans the entire globe and is able to be self-sufficient with its population, fail to notice that flaw in the design?   The train was a tourist attraction that everyone got trapped on when the world suddenly froze.  It wasn't designed to support a population forever.   And lastly, the ending. A polar bear in the snow is supposed to be a glimmering beacon of hope for life on Earth, as if there had been any climate shift in global history has been enough to extinguish every last life form on the planet. Not to mention at the end of it all, it's two kids left to fend for themselves on a frozen landscape. Some hope, indeed.   The ending is open to interpretation.  I didn't see it as hopeful.  I saw it as even after all that, the kids are just gonna get eaten by a bear."

I saw it as even after all that, the kids are just gonna get eaten by a bear.   Bong said that his biggest regret with the movie is that he used a bear, and wished he'd used a deer or rabbit, because everyone assumes the kids are going to get eaten.  He did mean for it to be hopeful, and regrets that he didn't make it clearer."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,jupiterkansas,3,Tue Jul 14 19:23:59 2015 UTC,"There's hope that there's enough stuff living for a bear to survive, but not much hope for the kids on the train."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,BranchDavidian,3,Tue Jul 14 21:44:52 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  Not that it's that important point, and a part of the fun was arguing with my friends about this after, but if there's enough to sustain a bear, there's surely enough to sustain two children.  Not to mention that the kids have access to guns, plenty of fur coats, boots, etc., and probably a decent amount of food to pick out of the wreckage, while they get their outdoors feet under them.  Plus the girls father trained her with what he was taught about surviving in the cold by those who went out before (I want to call them Eskimos, but I think that's a slur now)."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,Hyperbole_Hater,4,Tue Jul 14 21:59:12 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness, your critique is harsh but much appreciated. When I watched the movie, I enjoyed it for what it was, and could see the metaphor, though unlike many I didn't think that the allegory alone was enough to make for a compelling film. I thought the entertainment value and just general propulsive nature of the visuals were more than compelling enough for a sit through, but like you, I was caught up by the many many odd ""film-like"" qualities that seemed to make no sense.   In the end, if I had to call this movie one word. I'd call it ""SILLY"" with a broken caps lock key. It's hard to take seriously in any way. I still giggle thinking about the  SMG window fight. My goodness."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,bearses,3,Wed Jul 15 18:37:11 2015 UTC,"I'm glad someone is talking about all the contrivances in this film, because they drove me nuts. Where do all those kids sleep at night? Do they have to walk through the drug infested rave to get to their living quarters? I had a new world breaking question like this every five minutes, much to the chagrin of my sister, who quite enjoyed the film.   And layout aside, it makes absolutely no sense that the train would even exist. This isn't a minor thing. It's impossible on so many levels. As a Millwright, my job is to fix machinery in the oilsands. We're talking stuff that needs to run 24/7. But not 365, because no mechanical parts can take conditions like that for even one year without requiring shutdown and replacing. And let's not forget the track itself being vulnerable to earthquakes, fallen trees, corrosion, etc.   And then there's the matter of energy consumption. Let's for a minute concede the ridiculous notion that this train somehow produces enough energy to keep itself functioning (solar I guess?) The question becomes: Why? Why would you have it moving at all? Why waste that energy? Why not a bunker or a building? Because the forefathers were quirky? I can't think of a single explanation, and there's no evidence that the writer tried to do so either. The whole thing came off to me as an overambitious high school creative writing assignment.   I'm normally okay at suspending my disbelief, but there was just too much stupid coming at me too fast to ignore."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,Dark1000,6,Wed Jul 15 04:30:19 2015 UTC,"Again, this kind of criticism makes no sense. It's clearly an allegorical set up. The train has to make allegorical sense, because that's what it is, an allegory. The physicality of the train is besides the point. The scientific feasibility is not just a minor thing; it's totally irrelevant. In my opinion, ""plot logic"" criticism is probably the most backwards way to approach film."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,bearses,2,Wed Jul 15 10:33:27 2015 UTC,"I get that, but I guess my gripe is that the allegory just doesn't work for this film, at least for me. I'm sure the book is excellent. I've read plenty of allegory in fiction where the plot didn't make sense and I didn't care. The written word is perfect for that.   But I think for a film to pull off allegory, it needs to work on multiple levels. The allegory doesn't excuse it from being a film, otherwise you get Elysium. Films have basic rules that they need to follow to be engaging. If they're presented as a certain genre, they set up audience expectations that, in this case, they fail to deliver on.   That's not to say a film can't have surrealism. Some of my favourite movies do. Synecdoche makes no sense, logically, but it sets a tone, and there are enough cues that tell the audience that logic works differently in this world. And that's the failing of this film, boiled down. It doesn't do a good job at explaining what kind of film it's going to be. Because the allegory is so blunt, and because there's no hint that it doesn't take place in a world unlike our own, many of us misread it as a typical action adventure story. I feel like it was the kind of film that invited you to inspect its logic, and it did a bad job at communicating otherwise. because of this, I found it incredibly frustrating to watch, and was not able to enjoy the (honestly overblown) allegory.    To say that half the audience is watching it with the wrong mindset is honestly a mark of bad writing. If you're in a writing group, you can't say ""you're reading it wrong"". You look at the fact that your story isn't having the effect on people you want it to, so obviously something is missing. Either some context, or information, or tone has been excluded or gone over their head. As writers, our job isn't to give up on the people who don't get it, but to improve ourselves so that they do.   Sorry for the writing group tangent, but I feel like it applies here. It's not a masterpiece because it's divisive. Not all movies need to be masterpieces, and not all movies need to appeal to everyone. But I don't believe we should applaud a film for either not trying or not knowing how to strive for at least managing audience expectation."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,Dark1000,2,Wed Jul 15 14:58:11 2015 UTC,"I agree for the most part, I just don't think the physics and train design is where it fails."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,bearses,2,Wed Jul 15 15:53:25 2015 UTC,"No, now that I've written out that comment, I agree that it's not. But the fact that so many people took issue with it is probably indicative of the film's larger problem (expectations and genre). To continue the writing group metaphor, readers giving feedback can usually tell when something is wrong, but they'll often misidentify the source of the problem."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,Dark1000,2,Wed Jul 15 16:02:43 2015 UTC,The writing group is a good metaphor for sure.
TrueFilm,3d9idl,Lilusa,3,Wed Jul 15 16:57:30 2015 UTC,"Where do all those kids sleep at night?    In the guest rooms   Do they have to walk through the drug infested rave to get to their living quarters?   no.  The ""leisure"" section of the train is near the front, and the guestrooms/school section is in the middle.   Why would you have it moving at all? Why waste that energy? Why not a bunker or a building?   It's too cold to be outside, so they can't stop and start building something like a bunker.  Also they'd have to find building materials somehow in the the frozen wasteland.  The train was already running when the big freeze happened, thus trapping everyone on the train."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,bearses,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:56:13 2015 UTC,Yes but the train wouldn't run for even a year. And there's no reason it would be designed that way in a pre-apocalyptic world.
TrueFilm,3d9idl,Lilusa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:07:43 2015 UTC,Yes but the train wouldn't run for even a year.   It's a perpetual motion engine.  It was designed to run perpetually.   And there's no reason it would be designed that way in a pre-apocalyptic world.   It was a tourist attraction.  That's why it existed.
TrueFilm,3d9idl,bearses,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:09:11 2015 UTC,"Leaving the issue of energy aside. The parts simply wouldn't last. As a millwright, it was such a glaring problem that I was unable to ignore it. And yes, I know it was a tourist attraction, but that's kind of my point. Think about it from the perspective of investors or the guy creating the attraction. Parts degrade. Things entropy. That's a basic law of nature, that this movie takes no effort to say it doesn't follow. So we must assume that it does.   I work in the oilsands as a profession. You know those big tractors that dig in the sand? Those shovels need to be replaced 6 times a year. The treads on the wheels need to be replaced twice a year. Even diamond tipped drills wear down. It's not plausible that any machine could withstand the wear and tear of time and nature. I don't find perpetual motion plausible either, but that's a can of worms that I'll leave more education people to open.   So again, from the point of view of the attraction's creators, how will we overcome this hurdle? Perhaps we look to literally every other machine in the world, and replace the parts when they break. We'll need a maintenance crew. We have parts made and shipped to a location, where we take the train out of commission and fix it up. Wash the dirt off. Make it presentable as an attraction. If we're sparing no expense we can even have two trains and swap them out. We'd also need a construction crew to fly out and fix the track when there's a problem with it.   Surely you can see where the logic falls apart..?"

It is a movie about a class war that occurs on a perpetual motion train during an ice age.  The sticking point for you is that the track would degrade over time and therefore the movie is too illogical to enjoy?"

I know it was before the ice age. That's my point. There is no thought given to how the train was manufactured or designed in a preapocalyptic ice age world. What we have is the writer coming up with explanations for the train to work in this frozen world, but it's at the cost of it being plausible in the real world. And yes, if I'm unable to relate to a film or suspend my disbelief, it ruins my enjoyment of it.   It presents as a sci fi dystopia movie, but it doesn't hold itself to the standard of logic that people have come to expect from that genre. If that's not what the film is trying to be, then it does a poor job of communicating so."

TrueFilm,3d9idl,poliphilo,2,Wed Jul 15 20:00:05 2015 UTC,"I like critiques of this sort quite a lot, because it's usually an opportunity to learn something new & interesting (when the movie fails) and an opportunity to draw more insight out of a movie (when it succeeds). In this case, I think the movie hinted at some of the answers, especially those related to the sociology of the train. Admittedly, I can't defend every aspect of the physics without smirking at how ridiculous some of it is, but: I do think the movie does a fairly good job that betrays some thinking about the underlying physics/engineering issues.   Where do all those kids sleep at night? Do they have to walk through the drug infested rave to get to their living quarters?   Answered elsewhere here: they live in the guest cars, which connect to the school car. The rave is not in between.   no mechanical parts can take conditions like that for even one year without requiring shutdown and replacing.    Yes, this part I think we're merely meant to accept as ""soft sci-fi"" or ""applied phlebotinum""; the movie's at least clear on this point. I imagine it's some combination of future metal alloys, superconductors, and frictionless bearings. It's possible.   And let's not forget the track itself being vulnerable to earthquakes, fallen trees, corrosion, etc.   The tracks I think are mostly elevated so they could plausibly be isolated from the few remaining trees and (with proper engineering) earthquakes, tectonic drift, etc. Even today's tracks can last 50 years; future-alloys could do better.   And then there's the matter of energy consumption.   The implication I think is fusion power, with the fuel being hydrogen electrolyzed from collected precipitation.   Why? Why would you have it moving at all? Why waste that energy? Why not a bunker or a building?   Okay, so obviously the premise here is extremely weird. But I think they justify their weird choice a bit: the idea is that some aspects of the train—climate control, or fuel collection maybe—are only designed to operate as long as the train is in motion, so if they stopped, a lot of stuff would turn off. Sort of like a car with a dead battery. Imagine that it even could be restarted without trouble if it stopped, but it would require some kind of action outside the train: that would provide sufficient incentive to keep the train running indefinitely.  To be clear, I don't love the movie because it delivers fantastic answers to all these questions. But I think it gives decent answers to enough of them that the actual characters and plot are legible."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,bearses,3,Wed Jul 15 22:29:08 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for responding to all that. I'll admit it's been several months since I've watched it, and I was possibly a little too bored to catch maybe all those explanations. Some of them are okay, and yes, it's definitely soft sci fi (a la dr who) at best. Although I didn't really enjoy it as a soft sci fi story. It just seemed to serious for it.   I feel like drones and maintenance robots would have been an acceptable solution to most of the above problems. It mostly frustrated me, because I felt like it was a few revisions away from being a great film."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,BranchDavidian,7,Wed Jul 15 22:56:10 2015 UTC,"All your gripes seem to be about realism, in a movie about a man-made ice age.  It didn't fall flat for those of us who knew we were in for a Bong film, where river monsters are created by pouring formaldehyde down a drain that dumps into the river.

TrueFilm,3d9idl,jupiterkansas,8,Tue Jul 14 20:26:46 2015 UTC,"While The Host might have a silly monster movie premise, it doesn't do things that repeatedly make you question the reality of the film. There's a huge difference between simply being a fantasy, and telling a story that constantly defies logic and begs questions. The Wizard of Oz is more ridiculous than Snowpiercer, but The Wizard of Oz has a very sound logic to it. It's believable even though it's fantasy. Snowpiercer is not a believable fantasy."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,BranchDavidian,6,Tue Jul 14 21:42:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know what to say other than that I disagree.  You didn't really leave anything to argue with because you didn't give any reasoning, but I can't imagine how you can say Oz is ""believable though it's fantasy.""  Rather, Oz is enjoyable in spite of not being believable, as is often the case with fantasy.  Snowpiercer didn't suspend your disbelief enough, and that's fine, but the things people are choosing to call out are rather weak in the ""this was not realistic, and therefore ruined the movie"" department.  What about creating an aperture in the extremely thick glass by firing round after round into it, and then shooting across a canyon at someone in another car?  Yet, people complain that engine parts wear out after 20 years?  Our minds just work differently, and we probably won't be able to see things the same way here."

Star Wars is a sci-fi fantasy that utterly believable even though it's not realistic. You don't really question the Force, or how light sabres work, or how R2-D2 gets around so well (maybe that one you question). Yet all throughout Snowpiercer, reality keeps making you question the fantasy - how can he shot through that glass? How does the engine run? How did the entire earth suddenly freeze so fast that nobody could prepare?  Every time one of these issues came up, I lost a little faith in the movie, until I couldn't buy the fantasy any more."

See, that's what I don't understand.  Why extend a courtesy to other sci-fi and fantasy movies that you were not willing to extend to this sci-fi/fantasy movie from the get-go?  Giving examples of wholly unrealistic movies and saying, ""there's a logic to it,"" doesn't do anything to actually give weight to why you were willing to suspend your disbelief for those movies, but not this movie.  And it's fine, if that's your prerogative, to be uncharitable to this movie, but you're acting like it's some kind of definable thing.  How does the world's first perpetual motion engine work and how does the light saber work are in the same vein: It's advanced technology that we don't yet understand.    how can he shot through that glass?    How can a light saber burn threw a 2-foot thick metal door, but the heat doesn't burn the bare hands that wield it, and the splashing, molten metal never splashes on the user?     How did the entire earth suddenly freeze so fast that nobody could prepare?   How do spaceships enter hyperdrive and travel from planet to planet in no time when the universal speed limit is the speed of light?  It's too fast for reality, it's just conveniently fast enough to keep the story going."

It's the filmmaker's job to make me believe it. I have no obligation to accept the story the filmmaker is telling me, and there are plenty of films I've turned off simply for that reason. They weren't convincing. And I don't mean special effects - but buying into the story and characters. Star Wars and Empire were convincing. The prequels not so much, despite having better effects.  The more realistic a movie is, the harder it is to suspend disbelief. Snowpiercer's problem might be that it tried too hard to justify everything in a pseudo-scientific way, and if it were a little more fantastical, or fairy tale, or satirical, it would be easier to suspend disbelief. A problem with lots of sci-fi fantasies now is they try to give a scientific explanation for everything. George Lucas even tried to explain the Force. This doesn't help us suspend disbelief.  And yes, it is subjective. Some people will buy into a story and others won't, but in Snowpiercer's case, it's a problem for a whole lot of people - enough to call the film problematic."

TrueFilm,3d9idl,BranchDavidian,14,Tue Jul 14 18:45:08 2015 UTC,"A week before it's wide release I got to take an old train out into the country to watch it with Bong Joon-ho in attendance to present it, and then do Q and A after.  Nicolas Winding Refn was there, too.  It was magical.    I had built it up so much that I thought there would be no way I would be pleased with it, but I was.  It hit on all points-- the music, costumes, acting, pacing, story, fight choreography, etc.  Bong is just a massive talent, who has been under-appreciated for some time now (I can't get anyone to watch Mother [Memories of Murder is easier because murder is in the title, I think]).  I was pleased that when Refn introduced Bong to the crowd that he gushed about what a fan he was, and what a superior director Bong is to himself.   And yes, Evans knocked it out of the park, too.  I'm so glad Bong fought to keep Evans's best scene in there for the Western audience, even though it meant a smaller release."

The allegory was so in your face it was impossible to appreciate the plot as being anything other than allegory, and it was so simplistic and (intrinsically) linear it just felt like tired plot device after tired plot device with no character development.  Other than that it had the most boring and typical apocalyptic/redemptive narrative that was just so dull for me it was almost laughable.  Plus, there's no yetis! You have a snow world without a yeti? Preposterous! If anything the movie wasn't zany enough which could have easily overcome the nonexistent plot and characters.  That said I've come to appreciate that other people did appreciate it, and maybe it's a good way to introduce people to a much larger dialogue about dystopianism and apocalypse and its use as social critique.

So many people seem to think it's hyper deep and anyone who doesn't like it doesn't get it.   No offense intended but to me those are people with shallow taste in film, for the simple reason that it is so over the top and in your face with its symbolism it's almost not impossible to notice the on the nose dystopian classist tones from the first couple scenes. You should know exactly then the entire simplistic plot of the movie.   I love simple films that convey the complex in a simple manner that doesn't feel obvious, where it feels you learned something unique, I loathe simplistic films that convey semi-complicated topics with the deftness of a Toddler."

Also, to everyone in this thread referring to this as an allegorical film, do you even know what an allegory is? When your film is literally about a rebellion of poor people fighting for a better life against the oppressive rich, this is not an allegory about social inequality, this is a story about social inequality. The term allegory implies a deeper underlying meaning that is not presented on the surface of a story. Animal Farm is an allegory. Plato's Cave is an allegory. Snowpiercer is not an allegory, it is a movie about a war of social inequality."

I spent the rest of the movie wondering about all the logical inconsistencies of the train. For example, why do you have to walk through a nightclub to get from the food to the kindergarten? They built this amazing train and didn't bother to include a walkway on the side of every car.  Also, the big reveal that they were eating insects was colossally stupid. You're living in a claustrophobic slum barely protecting you from a dystopian hellscape, and the fact that the unrecognizable gel bars you've been used to for years comes from an efficient protein is the worst revelation of all?

Badly choreographed shaky cam fights and a complete lack of tension. I actually think it's quite badly made, and script is very wobbly. However, Chris Evans is fantastic.   Oh and for all those saying ""I don't get it"", I do. I completely do. The allegory was smashed repeatedly into my face that it was impossible to miss. It's just nothing new. Movies have been using this kind of imagery and subtext since we first learned out to make them."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,ttoasty,8,Tue Jul 14 18:48:43 2015 UTC,"I definitely got the point.  It's hard not to because it's so beaten into you throughout the film.  That was the problem I had with it.  It reminded me of a bunch of ethics 101 conundrums garbled together into a movie.  You've got a bit of Plato's cave, Omelas, class warfare, etc.  It explores utilitarianism, especially.  But it really, really beats you over the head with it.  And I was willing to go along with it for all but like the last 5 minutes of the movie.  I enjoyed watching Curtis Evans and the tail sectioners move forward through the train.  I was okay with all the sappy stuff about eating babies.  I thought the twist was great, though a bit predictable.  The acting was awesome all around.  My issue was the end.  Rejecting the utilitarianism of Wilford meant everyone died (except the two kids), which is basically the fulfillment of the trolley problem.  I sat through 2 hours of movie for an ethics problem that can be understood from a Wikipedia article.  There was no room for complexity, no alternatives but Omelas utilitarianism or death for everyone.  The ending had no room for grey area, which doesn't reflect reality at all.  The lack of subtlety, in my opinion, was offensive to me as the viewer.  I was loving it until the last 5 or 10 minutes, but it left me angry at the end."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,wmille15,3,Tue Jul 14 21:18:12 2015 UTC,"The only miss for me is Curtis' 'fireside' monologue. It's always tough when the camera does nothing and an actor has to carry the scene, and I don't think Chris Evans pulls it off. It doesn't help that everything there is exposition. Wilford's dialogue suffers a similar overdose of exposition, but his scenes are more visually active, and Ed Harris is a more interesting actor to watch.   These are the small things that hold it shy of a masterpiece."

These movies are fast, stylish, and generally give the middle-finger to Hollywood conventions of plot and character development. It's easy to forget that so many cinematic rules we have become familiar with are completely unnecessary and artificial.   The cast of Chris Evans - whom I agree played his role excellently - led many people to believe this would be a typical Hollywood blockbuster. In some ways it was, but the characteristic Korean speed of the film (I see it in The Host, The Good The Bad The Weird, The City of Violence, and many others) threw those viewers off.  I love this movie, and basically anything else I've seen with Song Kang-ho.

I grew up watching loads of asian cinema, especially horror, so i'm sort of ""used to"" this over the top, cartoonish style.

If so, yeah, you have a great point.  Speaking of which, the action is largely shot in handheld shaky-cam, but that's not bothersome. In fact, it's one of the few instances of shaky-cam (other than Saving Private Ryan, the Bourne films and Paul Greengrass's other films) where the desired effect of chaos is achieved without sacrificing visual integrity. Honestly, the shaky-cam in Snowpiercer is as downright appealing as the more fluid approach of The Raid films and the films of John Woo (same goes for Spielberg's and Greengrass's use of shaky-cam, IMO)."

Funny, as I've tried to get into Korean films I have found the exact opposite.  They celebrate contrivances and spectacle.  The whole point is that it is as much like a hollywood movie, on the surface, as possible.  It's their attempt to say ""See!  WE can do it too!!"""
TrueFilm,3d9idl,NeMajaYo,4,Tue Jul 14 22:37:41 2015 UTC,"I agree that they celebrate spectacle, I suppose that's what I mean by stylish. The aesthetic certainly borrows from Hollywood, but that's not what I'm talking about when I say Korean cinema tends to reject the way Hollywood handles ""plot and character development"". I mean that they don't indulge in Hollywood plot arcs and storylines as often, and instead let the story move in unpredictable ways while maintaining THEMATIC coherence rather than ""hero's journey"" type narrative coherence. Does that make sense?

The movie flows so well, the Korean characters present this fusion between Hollywood and Joon-ho.

TrueFilm,3d9idl,engineerwolf,3,Tue Jul 14 19:41:00 2015 UTC,"It's funny, all of Bong Joon Ho's films are critically acclaimed, fan favorite, cult classics. Memories of Murder is considered one of the highest pinnacle of films of the 2000s decade as well as an important figure in Korean New Wave. The Host and Madeo are similarly received as well.   Here comes Snowpiercer which Bong employs the same things that's always been his previous films: genre bending, subverting expectations, plenty of black humor, satire, and political commentary.   So what's the difference? Why did Snowpiercer get so much hate when the other 3 are so acclaimed?   The difference is now it has Captain America and other famous actors so now significantly more people watched it. Now, Bong's film has been released to general public. I'm sure if the same crowd watched The Host or Mother or Memories of Murder, they would have the same complaints and crudely brushing them off for being ""illogical"" or ""silly""     So of course the masses and majority of the /r/movies reject it. The top post criticizing the film isn't actual film criticism or discussion of film as an art form, but a dissection of the logistics of its sci fi element from a film that basically grows more dreamlike as it continues. You might as well start calling Animal Farm a bad novel for having illogical animal interactions.   People aren't trashing Snowpiercer because it isn't a good work of film. The visual language and camera work alone is brilliant. People are trashing it because it isn't gritty sci-fi thriller that they're so used to in Hollywood with the same old hero's arc it instead plays around and subverts your expectation of the hero mythos.  Respect to critics who recognizes Bong's talents and rightfully acclaiming it as one of the best films of 2014.    It does prove one thing, Harvey Weinstein was right for wanting to cut up the film, take 20 min of footage to make into the sci-fi thriller that the general public wanted. Bong Joon Ho's film just isn't that film.   To those complaining it's too heavyhanded or too allegorical. That's obviously the intent here. The nature of the film doesn't detract from the quality because it's not the film you wanted to see. Do explain what you got out of the allegory instead of repeating. ""ugh it's so obviously allegorical""    Because I've read tons of fascinating, differing interpretations of the film (some on truefilm itself) which suggest perhaps it's not as simple as you deemed it to be?   some fun links 1) http://blog.acton.org/archives/70893-understand-snowpiercer.html  2) http://jaysanalysis.com/2014/11/08/the-deeper-meaning-of-snowpiercer-2013/  3) http://io9.com/visual-breakdown-for-snowpiercer-reveals-the-trains-sec-1616609889"
TrueFilm,3d9idl,BranchDavidian,5,Wed Jul 15 05:01:20 2015 UTC,"I remember reading a short story, When I was 10. the basic plot line was, Author was waiting for the train in station. When the train arrives at its full packed. people are seating in the doors blocking the entrance. The outsiders trying to get in, the insiders trying to prevent more people coming in. eventually the author boards the train. and then on next station. He is the one seating at doors blocking people from getting in.  If the ""allegory"" you are talking about is this left-right forward-backward insiders-outsiders. a 1000 word short story did a good job of expressing that, to make a lasting impression on me at age 10. Its not that complex message to need 2 hour movie. cinematic medium has lot more to offer than this.   So unless I am missing something really important, I reject that the allegory and the visual medium make this film great.  The other problem I had with the film was even before it started, The premise is ridiculous. If you have power to hurtle gigantic metal boxes, around the world for years to come. You have enough power to seal of area of some sq kms or maybe a huge tower and provide centralized heating. maybe build greenhouses to grow veggies. The engineering side of me just can not digest this premise. There is no reason for them to be on that train."

Your primary arguments about the allegory aspect are valid, but this seems like a silly gripe.  I personally loved the pulp plot set-up-- it's a stylistic choice, not to mention that it's based off of a graphic novel.  Look at the character Mason, or the elementary school.  They were over-the-top in a fun, stylistic way, and you can either like the style, or dislike it, but to act like it's a failure in storytelling isn't fair.  And if you'd seen his other movies, like The Host, you shouldn't have been surprised by Bong's style.  If this is your first Bong film, then he's not for you and you might want to ignore his other work."

If you have power to hurtle gigantic metal boxes, around the world for years to come.    The train powered itself via a fictional perpetual motion engine.  The train was already in motion when the world froze over and thus the occupants of the train are trapped since they cannot survive outside the train.  The global freezing was an accident, not a planned event.     You have enough power to seal of area of some sq kms or maybe a huge tower and provide centralized heating. maybe build greenhouses to grow veggies.

TrueFilm,3d9idl,npotash,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:51:46 2015 UTC,"I..  Well, okay. See I'm not really sure why exactly people enjoyed Snowpiercer, and to some degree, I respect that they do. I have no problem with popcorn flicks, and to me Snowpiercer was exactly that.  There's a lot of talk regarding simplicity and allegory in this thread, but in both cases neither of those topics held any weight for me because they were blinded by the films several egregious flaws.  Simplicity is fine. Snowpiercer is a simple film trying to be complex.  Allegory is fine. Snowpiercer is an allegorical film in the same way a bag of bricks is an anesthetic.  When I sat down to watch Snowpiercer I had heard nothing of its release and had no context for its success.   Learning that it was a Korean director got my hopes up due to my appreciation for Korean cinema (revenge especially) and seeing a veritable cohort of A-listers within the first few scenes made me question why I hadn't heard anything about this film.  It was, however, the first few scenes that immediately cemented the film's itinerary and its inevitable decline over the next few hours.  Mentioning popcorn flicks, there's a big difference between being ""simple"" and the aforementioned. Everything I saw in Snowpiercer I've seen somewhere else and the characters, in their own rights, had contrived notions and goals.  Some things that really irked me regarding this.  Certain plot conventions were executed with little regard to the sanctity of dystopia.   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  Thing I enjoyed  7  Congratulations  How could this film have been enjoyable for me?   Maybe follow a rich family who's watching the poor rise up and they don't know why. Make an effective kafkaesque governing body Write better Don't focus on the plot at all and make a 90-minute fight scene, you know like Dredd or The Raid. Show some fucking artistic merit. Stylize it! I'm not saying Sin City weight, but I mean have some goddamn strategy instead of going for a boring ""woe is me"" dystopia. Even in a snowed-over landscape you can have lurid colors and even with terrible character development you can have interesting dialogue. Being empty due to circumstance completely drives Evans' character into the ground because he mistakes ""lack of emotion"" for ""not being emotive"".   I give this film 1 star out of how ever many there are in the conceivable universe because someone lacked the audacity to imagine anything greater."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,OnlyNameNotInUse,3,Tue Jul 14 22:42:17 2015 UTC,"you can have lurid colors   Did you watch the whole film? Personally, I'm glad the filmmakers didn't have to cater to your condescending suggestions about how it could have been more enjoyable to you personally."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,npotash,3,Wed Jul 15 01:14:02 2015 UTC,"I'm here for a discussion on films, not a downvote and out of place corroborations.  The entire movie didn't take place in the school car. I'm sure you have the frame of reference to know that traditional elementary classes are bright and colorful, bringing stimulation and life to developing minds.   This scene required colours and could not have been any other way. this doesn't mean it transcends the whole movie.   Every. Single. Scene. Follows a washed out Zack Snyder masturbation ethic of presentation.    They are bland and boring, much like Man of Steel's hideous lack of contrast.  Snowpiercer is grey, not because it needs to be, but because it's trying to dark and edgy. It's actualizing the gritty, grimey existence that is this awful train, but the lack of contrast simply denotes a feeling of boredom.   I never said they should cater. It's a preferential statement and I would appreciate a level-headed reproach to my arguments."
TrueFilm,3d9idl,OnlyNameNotInUse,3,Wed Jul 15 01:31:38 2015 UTC,"You can pick out the grayest scenes all you like, but there are plenty of more colorful moments in the film.

TrueFilm,3d9idl,BranchDavidian,4,Tue Jul 14 18:24:52 2015 UTC,Check his other films if you want masterful subtlety. Don't let this one steer you away from a modern master
TrueFilm,3d9idl,nostalgichero,2,Tue Jul 14 19:46:03 2015 UTC,"And I don't think subtlety is what he was going for, but more of an in-your-face, pulpy ride, albeit with some teeth.  Take The Host, for instance-- there's nothing subtle about Agent Yellow, but it's great.  It's more punk rock than Mozart, and that's not a bad thing if that's what you're going for.  People's preferences in style may vary, but I see no failure in what he set out to make."

Edit: Oh yeah, plot holes. Fucking plot holes. I really thought this sub would be above criticizing a film about a perpetual motion train for not making perfect logical sense."

TrueFilm,3dbhje,Joemopina,5,Tue Jul 14 23:55:40 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the film in a while, but I remember one critic, I think the essayist behind Every Frame a Painting pointing out Bay's tone-deafness in one shot in particular. It's the elaborate tracking shot that follows a japanese bomb from the plane to hitting the harbor. It shows in that one shot Bay's weird priorities of focusing on visual stimulation without any consideration for what the visuals should be conveying. Meaning it's a cool shot but it detaches us from the characters we should be caring about and if anything says we should care about this bomb.  I'd like to add more from my own personal opinions, as I think it's an interesting topic, but I remember so little about that movie I can't really comment. However if you're interested in hearing my opinions on Titanic ( the movie Pearl Harbor clearly wishes it was) then boy, oh boy, could I talk your ear off."
TrueFilm,3dbhje,whiteyak41,5,Wed Jul 15 04:14:51 2015 UTC,"This is a perfect microsm of Bay's arguably greatest weakness. It's almost like strength in character makes him uncomfortable. He can't look his writing in the eye, so he'll pan away to buildings exploding. The Island was so close to being a good movie, but halfway through the narrative did indeed take a backseat to spectacle. Pearl Harbour, on the other hand was filmmaking at its most overendulgent and irresponsible.   P.S. My ear is ready."
TrueFilm,3dbhje,bearses,3,Wed Jul 15 04:49:22 2015 UTC,"People shit on Bay's perceived or real sexism, racism, pandering, etc.. but I think his biggest fault is that he seems incapable of having a ""boring scene"". Both visually and through his choices in screenplays as well as how he directs his actors.   Take for example an early scene in Armageddon when an astronomer sees the asteroid for the first time. The scene will by definition be exciting on some level, you've got a lowly astronomer, who spends most of his life looking at the same damn sky, rarely seeing anything of note when: holy shit. An asteroid. Gotta call Nasa. Good scene, right?  Except that's not enough for Bay. Instead of being a two minute quiet scene that builds to a crescendo, it's a fortyfive second scene of shouting. It opens with the astronomer's wife saying ""I want a divorce,"" and ends with the astronomer yelling ""Get the book!"" ten times.   Oddly, I seem to remember Pearl Harbor as being Bay at his most restrained. He know he can't be big and loud (at least not at first) because he's making a historical epic. He does seem to be trying to make a capital M Movie here and there are a lot of stuff in it that work okay. Like I said, it's been a while since I've seen it but I think the script is a bigger problem. It's almost like Pearl Harbor was the scene in the Master where Freddy Quell tried to play nice and be a photographer at a department store, but once things went a little south (i.e. bad reviews) he said fuck it, I'll just fight people, get drunk and make Transformers movies for the next decade.   Maybe I'm mixing my metaphors a bit, but you get my point."
TrueFilm,3dbhje,whiteyak41,2,Wed Jul 15 06:07:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. What makes Bad Boys and The Rock shine so much brighter? Do those characters just come through regardless of his overindulgence, or was he much more restrained back in the day? Even Armageddon I felt largely earned its keep, character-wise.  Have you seen Pain and Gain? It's the best thing he's done in years."
TrueFilm,3dbhje,lookexpensive,2,Wed Jul 15 05:17:01 2015 UTC,"No I haven't. I'll have to check it out.   I think his early films are okay, because either :  a) he listened to creative input back then, and knew when to take good advice from people on set.   Or b) he approached those films with all the rules of basic film making still fresh in his mind.   Or some combination thereof."

TrueFilm,3dau3p,RonnyDoor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:25:19 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to be that guy and say that ""Islamic countries"" is a way too broad category    If you read my P.S., I think you have it backward.  I also gave Mexico as an example of time-shifting trend (2006-2015+) change impacting the family ( hope of youth ) in an isolation fashion.  This is not a geographic issue, this is a psych issue.  That's how New York City can equate to other geographic, languages, and mythologies (religions).  The essential theme of the film (art) is this:  (Campbell 1986) ""The big problem of any young person's life is to have models to suggest possibilities. Nietzsche says, ""Man is the sick animal."" Man is the animal that doesn't know what to do with itself. The mind has many possibilities, but we can live no more than one life. What are we going to do with ourselves?""  The children in the film's story are raised on movies, but not allowed to experience Life. No touching, no contact.  And Campbell (March 1, 1967) expands on this:    The human eye opens at a rather late stage in the development of the individual. He has already done the most marvelous work he will ever do. In a mysterious way, in his mother's womb, he has built a human body. And this body has organs that are directed to certain ends and intentions. And these were not the organs designed by reason, designed by consciousness. Reason and consciousness comes to itself and asks later, “What is it I am all about? What is it I am here for? Why is it I do this and that?”  Furthermore, the coming of the eyes into the human—not the human, but general biological picture—is very late. Life had already originated hundreds of millions of years before eyes opened and saw what was going on, saw what life was doing. Now if you'll see and think what it is that life does, that life has to do in order to be life—it has to kill and eat other life. That is the basic thing. This is a rather monstrous thing. And when the eyes see what the situation is, on which its own life depends, its own existence depends—when conscience and consciousness become aware of the pre-conditions of their own existence, there is often the sense of shock, the sense of horror. You know, the basic word of Buddhism: “All life is sorrowful.” That's one way of recognizing this. There is also the feeling many have of guilt simply for being alive. This is in a way symbolized in the image of the Fall in the Garden. Life is monstrous. Consciousness has other notions of how things ought to be, what virtue is, and so on."
TrueFilm,3dau3p,RonnyDoor,3,Wed Jul 15 01:46:59 2015 UTC,"I think you might have misunderstood me. I agree that the kind of isolation you're describing has the mentioned effects (wonderfully put by the way), I'm simply saying that by generalizing ""Islamic countries"", you're ignoring the fact that these trends are quite different depending on the different nations. My beef was just with your title. An example using cities: compare Cairo (or Istanbul) with Riad (or Kabul). You'll find that despite everything going on, as far as (straight) sex and intimacy are concerned, the younger eligible generation in Cairo is much more relaxed than those in Riad. The hemming, the isolation isn't that bad everywhere. There's some of it in most Islamic countries, but I do think it unfair to jump to throwing everything under one umbrella. Multiculturalism is well and alive in quite a few Islamic cities.   We would agree, however, if you would focus your observation on those living in Islamic countries who actually adhere to the ""classical"" interpretation of Sunni Islam (as you describe it). That, for me, would be a very important differentiation to make."

Again, you are not understanding me, personally alive today, or the dead Mr. Campbell.  The truth is, the psyche problem of Tokyo is the same as Islam.  The 1991 film Only Yesterday is a good illustration of the generalized (""society"") tendency that we ( ""generalized society"") favor mechanized life over art and love.  This topic is infinite.  Society is individuals, all complex, so you can't generalize perfectly. The topic is error by nature. It's ripe with misunderstandings. It's going to favor errors of interpretation. I'm asking you to go beyond that, to compare what others will see as technicalities.  I could provide 100 quotes and 17,300 pages - but if you don't wish to see that all humans are equal under skin or geography, then you won't see the expression of the film - New York City - to generalized (Millions of families cursed by the year 2015 superficial view of Islam identity and passports )  Mohammad represents a time period (sunrise without Electric Lighting) and a geography and it's poison today to adhere to it.  Just like this film depicts a New York City life with movies and art, poisoning children.  Sufi Islam is the loving and globally tolerant Islam.  it is a non-authority Islam.  it's one of inward parth, of the Mystic, of the self-learner from a book - the Quran.  A fiction artwork that can bring great inward education - but not good when it creates a outward-focused ( Literal, Historic, Authority ) sickness of isolation and intolerance.  I don't expect people to agree. I know the history and psyche of people.  They want to fight Shia vs. Sunni, and ignore the Sufi.  They want to fight Atheist vs. Jesus follower - not the position that Myth is fiction, that The Bible and Shakespeare are equal books (of fiction, but perhaps not of popularity and influence).

Check out my review from when it premiered at the Berlinale."
TrueFilm,3dad3p,TyrannosaurusMax,2,Wed Jul 15 05:13:32 2015 UTC,"I'm very harsh in what I wrote, and do push points very hard, due to the fact of how the film was received in Berlin - hailed, as some put it to me, as the best film they've seen in a long time. I keep seeing below-mediocre films not only receive attention and awards from festivals but really excite audiences too.   ""Sturla Brandth Grøvlen’s win feels more like the gold medal awarded a marathon runner for his endurance"" - Exactly my thoughts. In my opinion, unjustified."

ON the other hand, the film I felt actually deserved the award, Under Electric Clouds was also awarded a silver bear for it's great, meditative cinematography. Reminiscent of Tarkovsky and nearly Victoria's visual opposite. Because they awarded both, I'm less inclined to complain about it.   But yeah tons of mediocre films really excite the general movie-going public all the time. I'm even shocked that critics go for certain films sometimes that are clearly not worthy. Just last night I finally saw The Tribe after hearing so much about it, and I hated it. So it goes. I think you just have to learn to just accept it for the most part. Just try to get people to broaden their horizons instead of getting too hung up on the little buggers.   Also just noticed your username, haha. Are there any contemporaries that you see as the sort of 'torch-carriers,' who keep fighting the 'good fight'?  I think every generation will think they're living to witness the end of good art, it's been like that more or less since art began.

TrueFilm,3dad3p,Arlisin1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:53:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that the movie is neither intellectually engaging nor visually exceptional. As a matter of fact: I hated the movie. Watching it was one of the worst movie experiences I ever had.  Throughout the movie I was constantly annoyed by the utter stupidity of the characters and their erratic and knuckleheaded behavior. I audible sighed and gestured in annoyance for most of the second half of the movie and to my own shock I found myself hoping for the protagonists to get killed and was very satisfied when most of them did.  With that being said: it was also one of the most intense experiences I ever had watching a movie. I was completely immersed and wished to smack some sense into the protagonists and to me that was why the first half of the movie was so important. It created a sense of real people doing banal things quite succesfully (which is why I felt it was even important that no actual meaningful dialog took place), partly due to the superb acting (at least from the main characters. Some of the supporting roles like the Gangster were quite bad.) and the superb camera work which made you feel like you were really there looking over the shoulders of these people. This movie was succesful in making me loathe the characters from the bottom of my heart and made me discover a dark side of me which I never before felt so strongly during a movie and which should normally be reserved for ""proper"" villains.   So overall I hated the movie. But this hatred is what makes this movie so exceptional to me. I thought for a long time afterwards about my feelings regarding this film and was driven to tell anyone who didn't want to hear it about my vitriolic hatred for this film. So to me at least it was one of the most emotionally enthralling experiences I ever had watching a movie even if it was probably a different emotion than the director had in mind."
TrueFilm,3dad3p,goug,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:26:06 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the gimmick of the one take made it feel visceral, physiological.  We get to meet the gang, fear they might harm her. But then we know everything the guys know about the girl, and we know everything the girl knows about the guys and that makes us somehow part of it.  When Sonne talks to her when she’s leaving it feels random. When they actually get to meet the street, that feels so real The german guy and spanish girl's way of talking is exactly how you expect two young europeans to talk together. Some things are drawn out, some other a bit clumsy like the piano playing... But it doesn't matter in my opinion.  And when shit goes down, we get to root for them or for her or hate them, but we feel so engaged. Like we do get scared of the bad guys, Boxer's relations. When the guns appear, it does not feel like any gun in a regular gangster movie. I could feel for Blinker just before the deed, being sick. When the car wouldn't start, I was freaking out. When they forgot about Fuss in the back, it took me a while to remember about him because it was all about having made it and when the cops discover the car I was shitting my pants.  I quite rarely feel these emotions when watching a movie, I don't often relate to the characters. We don't feel bad or good for them but we feel the pressure they're under, the tension. That's the closest I'll ever be to robbing a bank and a shootout and that's good enough for me. Compare that to Heat (a stretch I know) shootout, I never felt any fear or tension. Just enjoyed the way it looked and sounded and the cinematography.  Sometimes you would like the characters to not be so wreckless and go party. They don’t keep it together, it’s annoying. But it’s because they had no time, none of them, to think it through. So their braking down is nearly expected, even though it’s infuriating.  In the end the fact that it was one single sequence brought all of that together. They could have stuck it together artificially like Birdman or Irreversible, I would still recommend that movie.  The plot and the cinematography are not that good, but I don't think it was about that. We don't need another bank robbery to look good.  This movie is an experience, not just a gimmick."
TrueFilm,3d65as,penurious,31,Mon Jul 13 20:46:21 2015 UTC,"Never take sides against the family. It wasn't revenge. It was necessity in Michael's eyes.  Anyhow to your actual question, as to why it's there: to illustrate how far Michael has gone down a path that he never intended to go down. Audiences may not necessarily have remembered how non-mafia Michael was at the beginning of The Godfather - ""That's my family Kay, that's not me"" - to paraphrase. It's a great callback to the guy who who wanted nothing to do with his father's business: a man apart.   You may not think it is needed, but it works."
TrueFilm,3d65as,drevill,10,Tue Jul 14 02:22:53 2015 UTC,I think what Coppola was after was that your character shapes who you become - Michael was a natural leader and icily efficient and he became the Don and replaced Vito because he grew into himself
TrueFilm,3d65as,radii314,5,Tue Jul 14 04:15:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it wasn't needed, I said it was jarring as it doesn't fit into the narrative in the a traditional sense.  I didn't get this across but I actually love the scene and think that it's a powerful technique for getting the audience to think about the themes in the film.  It's like ""Huh what's that doing there""?  You make a good point that it also does serve to remind us that Michael originally had no intention of being part of the family business.  I was trying to get at the fact that it also reinforces that Michael is very much an individualist, who'll do what he wants regardless of how it might hurt the family.  Over the course of the narrative he of course does end up being the don, but in many ways is a very different don, far more ruthless, even with regard to his family."
TrueFilm,3d65as,kupfernikel,9,Tue Jul 14 07:31:54 2015 UTC,"Michael is very much an individualist, who'll do what he wants regardless of how it might hurt the family.   I dont see it that way. He came back to the family when it needed him: when he noticed how bad of a Godfather Sonny would be, and specially, when he saw how his family was going to be picked apart by it´s enemies.  He was almost out: his father recognized him as a man who had his freedom, his american wife was a perfect ticket out of his sicilian lifestyle. Yet, he ran back to the family when it needed. Not because a thirst for power, but because he was the only one who could do it.  But then, things fall apart.  And I think we are kind of forgeting an important theme of the movie: you can´t run from your roots. You are a sicilian, Michael. Your fancy college education, your american wife, your money and all of that do not hide the fact that you are a sicilian. He couldn´t live like an american."
TrueFilm,3d65as,dasheea,5,Tue Jul 14 08:46:47 2015 UTC,"I agree, Michael becoming involved with the family is a somewhat selfless act.  However, Michaels return to the fold is also motivated by the fact that in some ways it's inescapable. His father is shot and his brothers are pretty useless.  Without him stepping into the fold everything will fall apart.  His family (and by extension him) will be left with nothing.  There's also a very personal revenge motive which leads him into the shooting.  I don't really think I am forgetting the fact that Michaels heritage is a big theme in the film, it just doesn't inform this scene to a large degree.  It's definitely an interesting part of the film though, particularly in his relationship with Kay and also the plotline involving the senator.  I hadn't thought about it much before."
TrueFilm,3d65as,kupfernikel,4,Tue Jul 14 10:27:30 2015 UTC,"""That's my family Kay, that's not me""   Considering how different the perception of Don Michael is compared to Don Vito, maybe Don Michael still ""is not the same as the rest of his family.""  His family, i.e. Don Vito and his sons, rules a lot more by love and emotion.  Vito on his own is a smart don, but I think one can say that he hasn't been smart with his kids.  He's let his love allow them to grow up however they want to, thus resulting in such different personalities as Sonny (emotional, spoiled prince), Tom (cerebral), Fredo (loser), and Michael (aloof, smart, looking for a WASP ""American"" life (in fact his desire to fight for country fits in the theory that he wanted a more ""American"" as opposed to ""Sicilian"" life)).  Vito also (I'm not sure, but I think) deliberately doesn't step in to do anything about Connie and Carlo's abusive relationship.  I think there was some thing about ""As a Sicilian, it would be disrespectful to tell your son-in-law husband what to do regarding his wife,"" but the point is that Vito approached family in a more emotional, traditional way.  And I suppose the first scene of the first Godfather is there to emphasize that Vito desires mutually respectful relationships with civilians, i.e. something based on ""love.""    Don Michael is not the head of a lovable, big ""Italian"" family.  Everything is business to him, from Kay, to having a son, to Connie, to Fredo.  But the reason he's like that is because he saw the collapse of Vito's reign in the first Godfather.  The main reason he joins the family is he feels obligated to it and he can't stand by and watch the family business collapse, but the second reason he joined was because he saw what an idiot Sonny is and he realizes how smart he himself is, and if he didn't join the family business, it was definitely going to collapse.  But neither of these reasons have to do with regular old family love or duty though - regular old family love and duty would have caused him to join the family business straight away after school and not join the military and do exactly what he thought Vito expected of him or what Sonny or Tom wanted.  He joined the family business out of a sense of obligation after seeing how weak the family was.    My point is that perhaps Michael hasn't changed that much from the    ""That's my family Kay, that's not me""   point to the end of the Part 2 movie.  He hasn't become like his old family.  I don't find him particularly ""Sicilian"" (i.e. what the movie tries to portray as what is being a ""Sicilian"").  He's still his old aloof, smart self that we saw in the beginning.  The one that changed was that he decided to let his sense of obligation take over his sense of wanting a WASP-y American life.  To me, Don Michael at the end of Godfather 2 and Michael the fresh college graduate look remarkably similar when sitting contemplatively in a chair."
TrueFilm,3d65as,TheSuperSax,2,Wed Jul 15 20:53:35 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I agree with you.  I mean, there is not one single thing that motivated Michael to do this or that, I guess that is part of why the movie (and the books) are so awesome. Complex characters."
TrueFilm,3d65as,TheSuperSax,3,Tue Jul 14 10:30:43 2015 UTC,"I think a point you made is particularly accurate vis-à-vis the whole series:    He was almost out: his father recognized him as a man who had his freedom, his american wife was a perfect ticket out of his sicilian lifestyle. Yet, he ran back to the family when it needed. Not because a thirst for power, but because he was the only one who could do it.   In Part One, Michael is almost out to live a dream life with Kay, only to be pulled back in to help save his family from poor leadership and annihilation by its enemies.  In Part Two, Michael secures his family's future and cuts out all threats and loose ends, while positioning it for legitimacy—trying in essence to get his whole family ""out"" while maintaining strength, unassailability, and infallibility.  In Part Three, his great plans are again brought to a head, leading to the phrase oft-repeated (not without reason, as I think it can really be used to resume the whole series): ""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"" Michael has twice made major life decisions to try to move away from crime, only to be drawn into bloody wars between the Families."

TrueFilm,3d65as,guttertech,41,Wed Jul 15 14:13:51 2015 UTC,"I think that you miss a very important theme in this scene.  Michael is sitting at the lake, surely thinking of the murder of Fredo which has just happened and which he had ordered.  When we are treated to the flashback to Vito's party and Michael reveals that he has enlisted in the Marines, Sonny and Tom are both critical, but Fredo tries to congratulate him.  Fredo alone does not have a negative snap reaction to Michael's decision, perhaps indicating an avenue of understanding between the two men that is never properly explored, either because of pressure from Sonny and the others, or because of the physical distance that Michael creates, or perhaps simply because Michael does (as you indicate) create a situation of being an absolute patriarch.  It's really a shame that Brando opted out of this scene at the eleventh hour.  Seeing Vito's reaction to Mcihael's announcement could have informed the movie in a completely different way."
TrueFilm,3d65as,PilotLights,30,Tue Jul 14 01:16:54 2015 UTC,"It's really a shame that Brando opted out of this scene at the eleventh hour. Seeing Vito's reaction to Mcihael's announcement could have informed the movie in a completely different way.   I don't know if I agree with this. Different, yes, but would it serve the film better than what we got? The thing I've always taken is that Vito's physical absence in that scene parallels his general absence in Michael's life. They're a close family and he clearly influenced Michael in some ways, but that influence only extends as far as Michael understands it - which is to say only superficially. Vito puts family before himself and the business. Michael the opposite. It seems fitting that we never see Vito. He and the rest of the family were always a room away. Just out of reach."
TrueFilm,3d65as,logopolys_,19,Tue Jul 14 01:52:12 2015 UTC,^ This. I think more is said by Vito's absence than would be said by his being in the scene. It makes Vito's presence felt all the more strongly because you feel his absence and causes you to reflect all the more by the shadow that Vito casts on his whole family.
TrueFilm,3d65as,radii314,11,Tue Jul 14 01:55:28 2015 UTC,"While this is a good reading, I'm still intrigued since it was not the intended scene at all.  Coppola and Puzo had something else in mind; something inferior, maybe, but I'm interested."
TrueFilm,3d65as,TheSuperSax,9,Tue Jul 14 03:00:29 2015 UTC,"in practical terms the film(s) needed only one reaction from Vito regarding Michael's independence ... and we got it in the scene where Vito is brought home from the hospital and finds out Michael did the hit (I know, first movie but same overall story)"
TrueFilm,3d65as,Thendel,5,Tue Jul 14 04:13:40 2015 UTC,"Yes this is exactly what I was trying to get at in the post.  As another poster has commented it was the original intention to have Vito in the scene. However, its just one of those happy accidents that Brando decided not to show up and I think the scene gains a lot of power because of it."
TrueFilm,3d65as,jzakko,6,Tue Jul 14 07:17:34 2015 UTC,"I watched that scene recently and was struck by, firstly this nuance of Fredo's affection and sympathy followed by his own execution for treason (I would disagree with an evaluation as ""murder"" because I think ""the Family"" operates outside of conventional society in terms of its internal workings. Of course it's literally murder, but I don't think any of the people involved would see it that way until Michael does in III.)  The second thing that struck me was, as you mentioned, the duality of Don Vito's resounding presence through his absence, and the fact that he never actually appears in person to show us his reaction to Michael's enlistment."
TrueFilm,3d65as,dasheea,4,Tue Jul 14 11:12:32 2015 UTC,"Fredo was always the affectionate brother. Moreover, he's never dealt in thinking about the whole (of the family) over the individual; here's his bright little brother, making a courageous decision by himself, and thus he doesn't get Sonny's anger over Michael deviating from the narrative nor Tom's ambitions on Michael's behalf. He just wants Michael to be happy."
TrueFilm,3d65as,Caesar_Sosay,8,Tue Jul 14 11:53:20 2015 UTC,"You and others mention some good things, I just want to give one other reason why I like that birthday scene so much.  I look at the godfather part ii as the end of the story and ignore part iii, coppola intended it as the ending when he made it and it functions as a much better ending.  The birthday scene is an incredible moment of putting the entire story of the two films in perspective.  Almost everybody in the room either betrayed or was betrayed by someone else in the room, from Carlo betraying Sonny, Tessio betraying Michael, Fredo betraying Michael, and Michael eventually killing Fredo, among other examples.  We see these familial (both blood and non-blood) relations while the relations still hold strong but we see them with all the context of how, when, and why they're going to disintegrate.  Then we see Michael sitting alone, in the room and then in the next and final scene, and the full understanding of how much Michael has alienated himself from his family and his humanity sorta has it's full impact, on me at least."

TrueFilm,3d6qqc,drive27,6,Mon Jul 13 23:25:27 2015 UTC,"Question I would have about the whole piece was around Philip's arc, this being an American film we are used to protagonists (usually) improving as they progress through the story, but I felt Philip was pretty familiar at the end, though perhaps more humbled by his experience.   What I liked about the film as it went on was that it shifts from fully being about Schwartzman's character to being about those around him. Even though he doesn't go through big changes the way he is enacts changes in others. Elizabeth Moss in particular goes from someone who would constantly enable her own unhappiness by keeping Phillip in her life but by the end partially due to him she learns to push back those who are bad for her. It's a surprisingly hopeful and empowering spin on someone's most harmful relationships.   With Phillip and Jonathan Pryce's characters their impulse when failing or hurt is to retreat into themselves or to someone just like them. Moss on the other hand reaches out to family, changes up her life a bit, doesn't just get stuck in the mud of her own flaws. She's not so self-obsessed to consider change a weakness but I think Phillip and Pryce do. It's the insidiously damaging effects of being overly insular.   I also really liked the voiceover. Especially considering it's about so many people lost in their own head and own point of view it's perfect having an outsider be the voice of the film. Eric Bogosian just fits that New York man of letters vibe too."
TrueFilm,3d6qqc,a113er,5,Tue Jul 14 10:34:51 2015 UTC,"From the director's AMA:   It is narration, not voice-over.

A third person narrator is seldom used.   Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k5co1/i_am_writer_director_alex_ross_perry_of_the_film/cli2ze8"
TrueFilm,3d6qqc,erikgahner,2,Tue Jul 14 12:41:41 2015 UTC,"I will start off by saying I'm a fan of the movie, I think the voice overs work. They give insight we wouldn't get normally from just watching, but we would get if we were reading a book. The movie is about an author. Would be a completely different movie without the v/o.   At the end of the movie, the narrator tells us that Philip would become wealthy and successful, writing more books, ultimately getting what he wants (or he thinks he wants.) He however, is a lonely person and casts away those who care about him.   Philip is egotistic and he never really gets over himself, even though he would go on to acquire wealth and fame, he isn't happy. My opinion is that he really wants love (as we all do,) but he clearly cannot balance the priorities in his life.   My take is that we as the audience are supposed to watch Philip's journey and come to the conclusion that we don't want to be like him. We all know someone like Philip, maybe even ourselves, Philip reminds us to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Money, power, and fame isn't everything. Life seems more alright when you have people that care about you.   Just my two cents."

TrueFilm,3d28bi,hk317,23,Sun Jul 12 22:54:59 2015 UTC,"This is great and more or less how I grokked the film also. I think to focus on Fletcher's person or on the psychodynamics of the Fletcher-Andrew relationship is rather missing the point (are they codependent, is it sadomasochism, whatever) because Fletcher and Andrew are not people but archetypes of the Student and the Master. But I don't think Andrew is usurping Fletcher's authority here - I think Fletcher's authority is a sham from the beginning. He's the old man on the mountain, not the father.  If Fletcher is any person, he is Linji Yixuan, the founder of Rinzai Zen. Here's a bit of Linji:   Rinzai instructed his assembly and said, “There is one true person of no rank, always coming out and going in through the gates of your face1. Beginners who have not yet witnessed that, look! look!” Then a monk came out and asked, “What is the one true person of no rank?” Rinzai descended from the rostrum and grabbed him. The monk hesitated. Rinzai pushed him away and said, “The true person of no rank – what a shit-stick you are!”   What's the point of this? When a monk comes to a master, it appears that the master is a great and fearsome figure, who knows terrible secrets and holds the keys to the monk's salvation. The master is always putting impenetrable riddles (koans) to this poor monk, which can only be answered by a sudden flash of spontaneous intuition. Every attempt by the monk to please the master and solicit his approval ends with the master striking, berating or humiliating the monk. Because, of course, every attempt to please and solicit approval is contrived and premeditated - exactly the opposite of spontaneous intuition.  But on the other hand, the master conducts himself as if vested with great personal authority, and he is always exerting this authority by putting the monk down. So the monk feels very anxious and under tremendous pressure, and as long as he feels this way, he finds he cannot act spontaneously and pass the test. So he is in double-bind.  He can only ever get out of the double-bind when the pressure cooker blows and he rejects the master's authority entirely, sees that the master's approval is utterly worthless. In a way, the task of the master is to become the image of all mortal authority for the monk, to make himself the ultimate obstacle, and in that way to lead the monk to overcome it.  So all this is what you get in the final scene of Whiplash. By the time Andrew gets Fletcher's approval, he no longer needs it. He doesn't need Fletcher to tell him how good he is, because if he didn't already know it, he would never have gone back on stage. But before he could do this, he had to build Fletcher up in his mind and then burn him down. And Fletcher knows all this.  I think the test of this interpretation is whether Fletcher is just being petty at the end (which most people seem to think) or if he is still testing Andrew. Well, on the face of it, Fletcher's really only been teaching Andrew the whole time. He steals the sheets for Andrew. He knowingly gives Andrew's core spot to a lesser drummer. He is constantly manipulating other students and staging events for Andrew's benefit. So why on Earth would he suddenly stop in the final act? And finally, when Andrew asks him if ""there is a line"", Fletcher answers that no, there cannot be any line. Well, if there is no line, then kicking Andrew out of the band does not cross the line, and humiliating him on stage and ruining his career does not cross the line. So Fletcher plays the Master until the very end, and when Andrew sees through the act and stops playing along, Fletcher is successful."

That's how I read it, the very last frames being of his satisfied smile seemed sort of like ""you've arrived"" or some similar success state. Andrew has become great, which was always Fletcher's plan and goal.  While Andrew stole that power of band director in the end, I don't think it was the intention to fully replace or betray Fletcher either - the ending, in my mind, is a power dynamic that's more equal: he's taken the power by force to prove that he can and Fletcher, understanding this, rolls with it. But if we continued the story a bit, I don't think Andrew has become the new band director, he hasn't fully usurped the king's power or particularly desires to hold it forever. He needed to act out in that situation to prove himself, and then he can cede that band director aspect back to Fletcher now that Fletcher sees the greatness (Andrew's goal)."

TrueFilm,3d28bi,G__3,8,Wed Jul 15 04:53:45 2015 UTC,"This is a really good analysis on the character dynamics and relationship between the two main characters. I think you've pinned down the complexities and the tension ( and, of course, the acting) that make the movie so great and memorable.  However, personally, I think that using jazz music to show the master/apprentice dynamics quite problematic. To be honest, this only came to mind after reading the New Yorker article (see here: http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/whiplash-getting-jazz-right-movies). I'm no proficient musician (I play a little guitar), nor do I think Richard Brody is, but I was convinced with the article, and this somehow changed my view of the movie significantly.  My question is, do you think the movie would have worked should it used a different ""medium"" in tackling the master/apprentice struggle? For example, if everything was essentially the same, except it was not about Jazz music, but -- let's say -- athletic sport or even the corporate world, would it still work?  I'm sorry if this isn't clear. English is not my first language. :)"
TrueFilm,3d28bi,LiverOfOz,3,Mon Jul 13 09:56:14 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. I think music was the obvious choice for Chazelle, who was a jazz drummer himself, but also music is a great medium because it is a performance. Painting or sculpting wouldn't bring the same intensity because there's no element of timing. Art can be perfectly slowly and in private until it's later revealed to the public to be judged. Performance art doesn't have this luxury. It is scheduled, and if the piece isn't ready, the result is catastrophe. On the question of whether a sport would have worked, I think it's hard to say. One never really loses musical skill. Fletcher is still a brilliant jazz musician himself, so Andrew never really surpasses him until the end of the film. With sport, a coach is almost always a worse athlete than his student because he is past his physical prime. However, most of the important elements of whiplash are still there. The fear of letting down your team, the anxiety of not being prepared, the humiliation of messing up in front of an audience. And, like sport and music, I think acting could have worked too, provided it's acting on stage rather than in a film."
TrueFilm,3d28bi,xxmindtrickxx,3,Mon Jul 13 17:22:27 2015 UTC,"You know it's interesting--after I first saw Whiplash in the theater (Dec 2014, I think) I immediately told all my friends to go see it, which included a number of professional musicians. To my surprise, most of them did not like the film. As musicians, they couldn't get past the visual/aural red flags that told them the world these characters lived in was a lie. It was as if the entire mise en scene was filled with ideological and stylistic contradictions. For them the beat was wrong here, the timing was inconsistent there, things that mattered in the film didn't matter in real life, etc. They were simply unable to suspend their disbelief. It reminded me that no matter how well crafted a film is, there will always be reasonable/rational viewers that will not be able to connect with it. I think that the New Yorker article provides an excellent viewpoint not often considered, but I also think it misses the point of storytelling. As a former music student myself (I played violin for 10 years, piano and guitar for a few) I can read music and understand basic music theory. I can usually tell when people are faking it in film/TV and it bugs the shit out of me. The musical sequences are cut in such obvious ways that the editing seems to exacerbate the already difficult presentation. Nevertheless, if the story is compelling enough I can usually get beyond these representational issues--it's similar to my issues with current CGI (don't get me started on that). I think the filmmakers here are ""asking"" their viewers for a bigger commitment/investment in a film like this--one that is apparently about the pursuit of musical greatness itself, which is why they tried harder than most to give the musical aspects a higher degree of authenticity. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, I don't think this film is really about music at all. I think music is a narrative tool--it provides a personal and emotional milieu for the protagonist and a goal that goes beyond rational/economic value, but in this sense it could've been one of any number of artistic/creative pursuits (filmmaking, painting, photography, etc.) and maybe even including sports (although that would've presented all kinds of traps and tropes to negotiate especially in regards to masculinity and power).   one side note: this film definitely got me interested to learn more about jazz drumming and Buddy Rich ;)"
TrueFilm,3d28bi,Zaiso,2,Mon Jul 13 22:11:25 2015 UTC,It has worked. Searching for Bobby Fischer does just this with Chess. A  little better than a good movie whereas I consider Whiplash to be a great movie. The climax isn't as fulfilling but the student/master relationship is quite similar.
TrueFilm,3d28bi,TheSoundOfHerWings,3,Mon Jul 13 20:21:52 2015 UTC,"I love this analysis of Whiplash and inspired me to watch what you dubbed the fourth act again. When I first watched this film I too found something entrancing and intangible in the fourth act but I wasn't able to fully comprehend what was happening until I read your post. The sublime aspect of the final act is one of the most accurate ways to describe what is happening. You highlight so many different lines of conflict that mesh together seamlessly to create a surreal experience of relationship to Andrew. I was unsure of the inclusion of Andrew's biological father in the final act especially with his last appearance in the film where he is looking through the door at his son. But given your discussion of their relationship it highlights the reality of their relationship. Andrew returns to the arms of his father where he is safe and gets a hug and a kiss. Yet, something pulls Andrew away from his father and from that point on Andrew never looks back. And following that Andrew's gaze is only at his drum set and Fletcher. Andrew's father can only look on at watch his son and the emotions he is feeling in that moment adds another dimension to the development of Andrew.  Thank you very much for writing your post it really helped push my interpretation of the film and hopefully my rambling made some sense."
TrueFilm,3d28bi,kraftwerk2,2,Mon Jul 13 14:00:42 2015 UTC,"Reading your comments made me really glad I decided to post my essay after all this time! I was concerned that the discourse surrounding this film had already passed, but it seems like people like us are still chewing it over. I suppose that's one of the marks of a great film. It always amazes me to see how much good discussions can enhance our appreciation of films/stories. It's a nice reminder of how much we as spectators and aficionados contribute to the social impact of a film like this."
TrueFilm,3d28bi,dwarfishism,4,Mon Jul 13 21:36:03 2015 UTC,"You have some good ideas here but you repeat yourself, your writing has a few problems and you warp the narrative at points. Let me illustrate:   The film narrativizes a fundamental thesis in patriarchal culture regarding the father/son (master/apprentice) relationship: ...   If the sexes of Fletcher & Andrew was female but script was the same would you still say this? Doesn't a ""patriarchal culture"" fundamentally oppose a young girl becoming one of the greats. Or are you implying contemporary Western cultures are patriarchal?   ...the mandate for the son (apprentice) to replace the father (master);...   Mandate under whose authority? God's? Culture's? Life's?   ...; thereby, allowing for the reproduction of the paradigm...   You neither need the semicolon or the comma.    ...The only way the apprentice (son) can transform himself into the master is to break the explicit rules of the master (father) operating to maintain the status quo, in order to paradoxically follow the implicit mandate of all masters--to dominate all...   This is really grammatically confused sentence.   ...In other words, the apprentice must apply the lessons of the master (become master of others...   A direct contradiction to the previous sentence.   ...The master hopes his apprentice will somehow exceed him, even if (or perhaps especially if) it means betrayal, in order to fulfill a transcendental purpose that is beyond the immediate understanding of both father and son, master and apprentice--this is how they reach the sublime...   A contradiction in the same sentence.    ...The key meta-lesson here is that...The meta narrative of the ...   Neither of your examples are self referential therefore not meta.  Then you go strong for a bit but misuse parentheses.   ...The implication is that not all ""masters"" have what it takes to help their apprentices become the best...   ...no  In paragraph 3 you claim Whiplash is a meta story which it is not. Also, can you please give examples of your post-9/11 destructive paternal relationships in narratives claim?  Whiplash isn't a 4 act movie. First Act ends with Andrew successfully playing Whiplash in the competition. Second Acts ends with Andrew unsuccessfully playing with a broken hand. Third Act ends with Andrew playing Caravan with the band to an ambiguous outcome.  If the credits rolled after your ""third act"" Whiplash would be a pretty anti-climactic film experience, which is a bad thing for narratives except in the post-modern camp.  Fourth paragraph is good except:   ...his reveals the paradoxical nature of the father's role in patriarchal society... what you say isn't paradoxical  ...Pain becomes transformative, but not for everyone--only for those with the potential to become the Charlie Parkers of the world. Therein lies the risk. What if you are not one of these butterflies in the making? That is the ethical dilemma that this narrative doesn't address. Is it ethical to crush the majority of people psychologically, emotionally, physically in order to find a a handful of geniuses?...   You must have had a brain fart at this part of the movie because they L I T E R A L L Y address the ethical dilemma immediately after the story is told, which motivates Andrew to return to stage in the grand finale and reveals much about the character of Fletcher.   ...And then a third possibility emerges through Andrew's actions as he changes the meaning of the story to something meta, wherein the new truth of the story incorporates the previous two meanings without contradiction or irony. The third meaning is that the story is the implicit mandate of all masters for their students to go beyond them--to break the (explicit) rules of the master...   No no no no. This is simple, Whiplash runs parallel to the Charlie Parker story end of the second act is the first half of the story, end of the third act is the second half of the story. Further both protagonists in the story get thrown dangerous things to their heads. Also it implies the ultimate fate of Andrew to the viewer even though the ending is left ambiguous.  7/10 you have potential."

TrueFilm,3d1tv7,doubledoverweeds,14,Sun Jul 12 20:58:49 2015 UTC,"In the off chance that you haven't seen director Peter Strickland (director of The Duke of Burgundy)'s previous film, Berberian Sound Studio, I highly recommend checking that out. Great experimental sequence to be found there.   There were nice single-shot instances of datamoshing in Holy Motors and Spring Breakers. Very cool.   Not a lot else is jumping to mind, but I'm thrilled to see this sort of becoming a 'thing' that is more and more acceptable because I really love coming across those moments in narrative films."
TrueFilm,3d1tv7,TyrannosaurusMax,2,Sun Jul 12 23:35:34 2015 UTC,"Seconding Berberian Sound Studio. I just rewatched it (for some reason the subtitles weren't working on my earlier viewing, which did add to the mystery right enough) and there are many great sequences there."
TrueFilm,3d1tv7,TriumphantGeorge,2,Mon Jul 13 17:12:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Berberian Sound Studio is terrific! Strickland's definitely one of the more formally daring theatrical filmmakers working today."
TrueFilm,3d1tv7,bonrmagic,12,Tue Jul 14 01:38:39 2015 UTC,"Harmony Korine is a filmmaker who consistently works with avant garde techniques (mainly his editing). While most of his films were not released widely, Spring Breakers reached a huge number of people. The chaos of the editing and the saturated colors were so prominent and not set in reality. Korine himself stated that he wanted the film to feel like a drug trip.  I don't necessarily think we're seeing more. If there was better access to foreign films in US theatres we might see more avant garde cinema."
TrueFilm,3d1tv7,TrumanB-12,4,Mon Jul 13 05:21:27 2015 UTC,30mil $ is quite hefty for a somewhat art house film. Especially surprising from someone like Korine who loves to break form and go against the flow. I'm so excited for his next project.   I read there is a sequel to Spring Breakers coming up from Irvine Welsh. All i know is that if they don't hire Benoit Debie  (DP) it won't be half as good.
TrueFilm,3d1tv7,filmingej,3,Mon Jul 13 07:12:51 2015 UTC,"It probably won't be very good at all. It's apparently a retread of the original story just with different actors, Korine's vision is no longer there, and did I mention it's just a retread of the original?   I think James Franco voiced his disdain for the sequel (slash remake)"
TrueFilm,3d1tv7,bonrmagic,2,Mon Jul 13 07:20:14 2015 UTC,The sequel will be trash if it isn't directed by Korine.   Not meant to be a two part film.
TrueFilm,3d1tv7,lasersaurous,5,Mon Jul 13 13:31:16 2015 UTC,"Not film, but the television show Hannibal, especially in its most recent season, has had a lot of very abstract shots, accompanied by an equally abstract soundtrack. There was actually a sex scene in the latest episode shot in a very interesting way, but the entire show is peppered with slow-mo things breaking and water spreading, etc.The visuals are very surreal and hallucinatory. The showrunner Bryan Fuller said, ""We are not making television. We are making a pretentious art film from the 80s,"" which I think it a very interesting way to approach a show.  I couldn't find a supercut of the abstract shots, but this fanmade trailer has some of them (NSFW)."

Julie Taymor has included some kind of creative-styled sequences in each of her movies (though it's been a while since she's gotten a widely-distributed film). My favorite was Frida's dream sequence via the Brothers Quay--though it's not a very recent film!"

Primer and Upstream Color are two of my favourite films in recent memory, and he's operating totally outside of Hollywood's sphere of influence.

TrueFilm,3d15vi,theDashRendar,2,Mon Jul 13 04:43:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He is definitely pushing the boundaries of what can be accomplished. I really don't understand why Hollywood is giving him such a rough time because he is clearly a gifted artist. He wrote, produced, directed, composed and starred in his own movies and then self-distributed them for crying out loud. Can't really deny how ambitious he is, to say the least.   P.S. Upstream Color did get a limited theatrical release before being on Netflix. At least, here in DFW where he's from and where he shot it."

One of my all time favorite Sci fi films, I've actually written about it before. It approaches a very common subject in film in a totally unique way. All non-actors, super low budget, but doesn't look it at all.   I believe Carruth has said he doesn't like it and would've re done it had he the chance. He felt dialogue was forced, but I like how natural it is and unlike most films. I mean we interrupt eachother in reality anyway."

TrueFilm,3d15vi,usabfb,25,Tue Jul 14 05:07:49 2015 UTC,"I think someday Jonathon Glazer will be remembered as this era's Kubrick (edit: I see now that this statement indeed seems absurd and unreasonable.  To clarify: I meant that if he keeps up what he's currently doing, then by the end of his career he will be comparable to Kubrick, not that his 3-film career is already comparable to Kubrick, though it is exceptionally good).  He has a similarly wide range of genres, an emphasis on imagery, symbolism and the supernatural, etc.  Truly brilliant and I can't wait to see what he does next.  JC Chandor likewise hasn't had a single misstep in his brief filmography.  Paul Thomas Anderson isn't quite as spotless but deserves mention.  His films are also probably a bit more appealing for most people than Glazer's.  Todd Haynes and Gus van Sant have been too comfortable as the best LGBT directors, so I'm glad that Xavier Dolan is now joining them, especially so early in his career.  Charlie Kaufman remains the greatest screenwriter alive (possibly ever).  The man is like Borges, Beckett and PKD all in one.  Unfortunately it seems like nobody is willing to fund or support him anymore.  In terms of visuals, Emmanuel Lubezki, Roger Deakins and Robert Elswit are still dominating everything.  They might legitimately be the three greatest cinematographers of all time.  Laika Studio is also bringing an eerie style of stop-motion back to the mainstream.  If not for Philip Seymour Hoffman's recent death I would've named him or Daniel Day-Lewis the greatest living actor.  In his stead I'd say the other bests are Joaquin Phoenix, Oscar Isaac and maybe Michael Fassbender.  Honorable mention for Edward Norton.  I'm not quite as knowledgeable about actresses but I think Juliette Binoche or Ellen Burstyn are likely the best, but arguably did their most innovative stuff in the past.  Amy Adams is a more modern actress, as is Cate Blanchett."
TrueFilm,3d15vi,Sadsharks,14,Sun Jul 12 21:36:30 2015 UTC,"It's a little early to be saying that about Glazer, isn't it? I mean, he's made three movies."
TrueFilm,3d15vi,usabfb,2,Mon Jul 13 00:26:54 2015 UTC,"Judging purely by those three, I predict great things but you're right, it's certainly not guaranteed."
TrueFilm,3d15vi,Sadsharks,3,Mon Jul 13 00:48:16 2015 UTC,"I must also ask why you consider Michael Fassbender and Oscar Isaac to be some of the best modern actors? Not that you're wrong, but Isaac has only a few standouts and Fassbender is often critiqued as being too bland (at least, from the criticism I've heard/read). Who are some other actors you consider to be very very good? Jake Gyllenhaal, perhaps? Personally, I think he gets less credit than he deserves."
TrueFilm,3d15vi,H_Donna_Gust,9,Mon Jul 13 01:01:02 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, can't believe I forget Gyllenhaal.  He definitely deserves Fassbenders place.  I like Isaac because, in short, he has a great range (folk singer, psycho tech genius, mobster) and to be honest I'm not sure I've ever seen a bad performance by him.  Like many greats he can make us sympathize even with terrible people like Nathan or llewyn Davis.  His character in Drive also has a lot of subtle nuance despite only being in a few scenes.  It's clear that he's filled with passion and some anger but tries to stay composed, and despite being a convict he cares deeply for his child and girlfriend.  Of course that's pretty simple characterization but the point is Isaac shows depth despite being there for like ten minutes and left me wanting to know more about him."

Kaufman's a good writer, but he's no Beckett and he never will be. But that doesn't mean he isn't doing good, original work in film and screenwriting.  I've only seen Under the Skin which was pretty reminiscent of 2001, but as I understand it the man has only made three films.

TrueFilm,3d15vi,Sadsharks,2,Wed Jul 15 00:56:30 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters, Beckett is the second most quoted/written about writer in the history of the English language, second only to Shakespeare. So unless you think Kaufman is going to take that spot, there isn't really much else to discuss!  The simple fact of the matter is that Samuel Beckett is considered by many historians, academics, writers, et al. to be one of the most important and influential writers of the entire 20th century.  So again, Kaufman's a good writer. But he is nowhere near, nor will he ever be, the level of Samuel Beckett."
TrueFilm,3d15vi,Sadsharks,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:40:23 2015 UTC,"Popularity doesn't equal quality.  I prefer Kaufman over Beckett, and many historians, academics, writers, et al. consider Kaufman to be one of the most important and influential writers in the history of film.  If you personally don't like him that's fine, but don't act like it's a fact.  I think he's already surpassed many of Beckett's works, but is not necessarily better overall."

For instance, I'm not crazy about his writing, but James Cameron has actually been one our more innovative filmmakers recently, at least regarding technology and pushing the envelope with CGI and 3D. Same goes for Peter Jackson and the potential shift to higher frame rates in mainstream movies (regardless of whether people think it's good or bad). And the transmedia Marvel franchise has expanded the way that audiences think about narrative universes and conventional distinctions between film and TV. My prediction is that, in twenty years or whatever, the expanded Marvel universe will have set a template for popular film and tv storytelling. Star Wars and the DC superheroes are already following suit."

I like that Peter Jackson is expermenting with higher frame rates, but I think that we are getting to the point technically where a film could have multiple frame rates. Wizard of Oz had the shift from B&W to color, and I think that interesting things could be done with tone and mood as it relates to the frame rate. I always think about the scene in Saving Private Ryan near the begining when the shell goes off and we hear the ears ringing sound, What if the frame rate of that scene was cranked up to 60fps or higher making everything hyper real looking? Or maybe a drug/drunk scene with the frame rate dialed down to 18fps and lots of moton blur in the individual frames.  I know ATM it would be a nightmare for editing and trying to replicate the film on Blu Ray, but it could be an interesting tool for directors to use. It could also be something like 3D that would make it more important to see a film in a theater then to wait to watch it on Netflix."

Even though they are both likely retired for good, Bela Tarr and Tsai Ming-Liang both changed the language of cinema. Tarr was able to slow his films' pace down to a glacial tempo and still make it fascinating throughout (even at seven hours), and Tsai was able to create the closest thing to a moving painting in history.  Raul Ruiz and Manoel de Oliveira did some crazy shit in the last fifteen year before kicking the bucket. A Talking Picture and Mysteries of Lisbon are both like nothing you've ever seen.  Additionally Ken Jacobs, Miranda July, Hong Sang-soo, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Kenneth Lonergan, and Jean-Marie Straub (who with his late wife was possibly the most radical narrative filmmaker in history) have been doing unique and underappreciated work lately."

Stray Dogs is also beautiful and has some breathtaking cinematography but tested my patience a lot at times, especially the ending but I think that's the point. Tsai is a Buddhist himself so I think most of his films are slow meditations and aren't filled with actions or dialogue like most filmgoers have become so accustomed to."
TrueFilm,3d15vi,knightmanmarcheson,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:12:03 2015 UTC,"In regards to your comparison to Chungking Express, I have to agree.  I haven't seen Vive L'amour yet (although I'm going to in the next two weeks), but when compared to What Time is it There?,  Chungking is not nearly as powerful.  Wong Kar-Wai is a wonderful filmmaker, but he places a lot of emphasis on his mise-en-scene.  His films are really flashy, which is great and makes them visual treats but less emotionally overwhelming, which is what makes me prefer Tsai Ming-Liang as an overall filmmaker."
TrueFilm,3d15vi,afewthoughtsonfilm,2,Wed Jul 15 04:27:34 2015 UTC,"His films are really flashy, which is great and makes them visual treats but less emotionally overwhelming   I think that In the Mood for Love manages to be both stunning visually with its superb use of the colour red and voyeuristic style (looking from the inside of a building out, seeing one side of the room through a window where the other person is cut off etc) as well as being very emotionally powerful. You're able to feel both characters' sense of loss, sorrow and confusion when they realise their partners are having an affair with eachother and this is highlighted by scenes of the woman (sorry forgotten her name) seemingly aimlessly roaming around the city slowly, the shots of the man (forgot his name too) smoking alone in his room and when the camera zooms in on both their faces, they're both filled with despair and loneliness. It also does a great job of visually showing how they grow closer and closer together, especially with the shots of hands, at first she rejects him but she eventually warms up to him.  Agreed with your point about Chungking and emotional depth compared to a Tsai film though, Chungking is beautiful to look at but I also think that because it moves at a relatively fast pace and that there are 2 stories that you never get to feel the full extent of the emotional pain of the characters. It's still a fantastic film though."

In the Mood for Love certainly made me feel; however, What Time is it There? made me sob.  For me, Tsai Ming-Liang works on a much deeper level than Wong Kar-Wai.  Both are fantastic, but I lean a little more in the Tsai camp."

TrueFilm,3d15vi,matter_memory,4,Sun Jul 12 23:55:28 2015 UTC,"who's re-invented an old practice that's gone unused for decades, who's working on subjects that nobody else wants to touch?  There's an emerging American filmmaker who isn't so much re-inventing as he is re-introducing what he believes to be the truest, purest expression of cinema. His most recent film is about a Mcdonald's worker. He is interested in people as corporations, memes, the corporate as nature/natural, neo-real/social real expressions of transhumanism. Some crazy shit basically, especially with how he is attempting to juxtapose the real world with a digital one, I've never seen anything quite like it. It's very practical, very logical, but there was a Lynchian quality. The images were very alone, very disturbing in that sense. Usually when you see technology it is depicted as something that brings people together, where people try to express themselves, try to communicate with others. What he was doing was the exact opposite. It was as though his characters were becoming trapped in it, physically and expressively they were prisoners. Attempts at understanding other people who were not physically there became blocks from reality, they were understanding something that was making them something other than human. That technological prison began to seep into who they were in reality. It was very disturbing.  What's crazy is everything I've seen or heard from him has been variations on Bresson's Pickpocket. In this lecture after the film he described Pickpocket as the instructions/basis for composing all films. The rhythm of that story, for him it was truest to the type of man that is emerging. But he thought of the film less as a depiction true to modern man and more as a musical-image rhythm that was true to him. So while he borrows from the outline to harness this rhythm his stories are something new and of this moment.  His work method was also discussed which is similar to Pedro Costa. He only uses light natural to the environment, he shoots static shots, he works with little or no crew. But his work is incredibly musical, there is lots of movement created from the tiniest gestures, his use of cuts. In many cases his images are near noir. You can see that he is trying to revitalize what Bresson was doing but on a much smaller scale. Aspects of what I saw felt revolutionary but you can tell he is a work in progress..."

So over two-three hours ten or so short projects are shown. This guy comes up near the end and shares what he had done and everyone in this small screening room was floored. He talked for fifteen minutes and then that was that. There were no credits but he gave his first name as Benjamin. I only mention him because, again, the whole thing was really weird if you were there. Usually people share little passion projects that they do just for fun. The quality of what is shown is pretty amateur. And this guy out of nowhere showed us something that had this enormous weight to it. It felt like some kind of main event. I don't know if he realizes what he's doing. It was really amazing and he only shared it with an audience of something like 20, 25 people.

There's plenty of original stories being made, the problem is they bomb because audiences want comfort food, not challenging molecular gastronomy experimental dishes. Edge of Tomorrow was a big-budget, unique and new property starring Tom Cruise, and did exactly fuck-all. Same with Pacific Rim (sans Tom Cruise).  Found Footage as a storytelling device is still in its relative infancy, with Blair Witch Project still not even 20 years old, and we're still seeing all sorts of innovation in that format.  The best movies being made today aren't movies, or they are, but they're 13 hours long - we are in a renaissance of great original TV programming, and not even in TV. Daredevil, House of Cards, Alpha House, Breaking Bad all have been revelations, and it's the TV format (even though in most cases they're consumed in huge gulps via NetFlix) that's making it possible. TV is no longer melodrama and static sitcoms; creators are starting to use the format for, essentially, telling whole stories that go on for more than 2 hours, but do have an end point.  Just some jumping-off points."

TrueFilm,3d15vi,Jon-Osterman,7,Sun Jul 12 22:47:18 2015 UTC,"Although I enjoyed both Edge of Tomorrow and Pacific Rim, they are not reflective of ""true innovation"". Edge of Tomorrow is a good genre film, but it does not stray from the conventions of its genre. Pacific Rim is specifically designed not to be original. It's a homage to previous other works. Neither play much with their form. Telling a story that is not based on a franchise is perhaps the lowest standard for innovation that I can imagine.  TV series are doing extremely well, but it's very clear that they are not ""13 hour movies"". They don't function like most movies or reflect the same kinds of aesthetics and story-telling sensibilities that movies generally do. It is still a different medium."

Jupiter Ascending is a great example of why studios are, and possibly right about, not giving huge budgets to original screenplays, despite epic scope. The wachowski bros actually made it a point that was probably their last big budget venture with epic-length original work.  This is actually a major point of my perspective, and why we see so much rehash and adaptation. Definitely a safe bet. So I guess what I'm looking for are the gambles, whether or not they pay off (usually dont)."

This is why I think, more often than not, low to medium sized budgeted movies are the best — it's not a big risk for the studios, so they can afford a little more creative freedom on the part of the writers and directors, and the same time, can have a close enough relationship with the filmmakers to make suggestions that can help a film become cleaner, leaner and ultimately, better."

They took a 600 page script and cut it down to two hours. The standard rate us usually one page equals one minute. So what made it on screen was one fifth of the original screenplay. I don't know what the original script was or whose idea it was to cram it into one two hour movie. The original script could have been a fun space opera, but we'll never know because all we got on screen was the Cliff's note version."

But there's the other end of it which is, why must they make everything a trilogy? As an aspiring writer, I've always been taught being concise is better, and if you can't tell your story in a reasonable size, you're trying to do too much. Then again, George RR Martin expanded his trilogy of books to 7, and he's got some decent ideas.  I don't think we can have it both ways with every story, and sometime maybe film isn't the best medium, and a 10 or 15-part series would be better for an epic space opera.

The second reason is that cinema is better than ever and only getting better right now. Things like Breaking Bad and The Fall are great, but come on. When film has, in the past five years, given us everything from The Tree of Life to The Turin Horse to Boyhood to A Separation to Ida to Leviathan to Whiplash, saying things like ""the best movies being made today aren't movies"" is ridiculous at best.   Why is it that people always look at the big blockbusters and automatically start saying that cinema is in a downward spiral? There's more to any art form than the big money-makers.

I imagine him doing his last documentary as a 107 year old dude on Mars, chronicling the lives of other one-way colonizers. I love him for putting a camera in front of so many offbeat and spectacular places and so many zany and interesting people. He is very funny/witty/humorous, but at the same time able to create stunning dream-like imagery. He is something of a philosopher as well, with his notion of ecstatic truth. Noé is pushing boundaries in the films I've seen of his, Irreversible and Enter the Void, both visually and with regards to narrative. I'm not sure he is wholly original, and especially Enter the Void is by no means a perfect film, but they sure do kick you in the balls and leave you wanting more.

There are just a handful of films that have had anything to say. Plenty of stylistic endeavors to push the envelope but lacking the foundation of great stories. Avatar? Fucking Blue Otter Pops in 3-D. Interstellar (or any Christopher Nolan) - puffed-up pretentiousness and dull. Paul Thomas Anderson - style over substance and self-indulgent. Wes Anderson - he makes little curiosity boxes for people who like cutesy shit like that. Tarantino - A brilliant cinematic DJ, mixing and scratching and making something new out of existing material (his innumerable references), Guy Ritchie - hes got one gimmick. Luc Besson - started out really promising but petered out. Duncan Jones - way overrated. Peter Jackson - started out promising, reached his apex with Heavenly Creatures then got stuck in CGI land.   The best films of the past 30 years? The Chinese New Wave films of Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou.  And Tawain's Ang Lee has done spectacular work as well.  48 FPS is a disaster since it affects the brain differently and can evoke the fight-or-flight response ... 24FPS gives every film a diffusion and a touch of the surreal, allowing the audience to drift into a different brainwave state and go with the story ... the hyper-detailed 48FPS is too literal, too realistic.  3-D is as sucky as it was the last two times Hollywood tried to foist it on the public. Over-reliance on CGI over practical effects and good acting has made many films into glorified cartoons.  It is videogames and online efforts that can be more stimulating and thought-provoking. This preview for a DC game is better than any Marvel movie or other superhero movie made yet by a major studio ... and this one is even better.

Dark Knight is one of the best superhero movies in how it was able to portray it's characters in a mature and realistic way.   Paul Thomas Anderson - style over substance and self-indulgent.

Wes Anderson - he makes little curiosity boxes for people who like cutesy shit like that.

So 2014 wasn't a good year in film for you?"
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,PervOx,19,Sun Jul 12 14:30:55 2015 UTC,"Guess I'll start by introducing myself. I've been fairly interested in film for as long as I can remember, but never really taken the dive into the deeper side of cinema, instead keeping to the more ""mainstream"" classics (Jurassic Park, Star Wars, and the likes), finally realizing that there's more to film than that. So basically I'm just catching up on the movies and directors I've been missing out on. Also, if some of the words I use seems to be incorrect or just plain weird in its context, it's probably due to me being Swedish, so please bear with me.  So, the first movie to be interesting enough for a write-up; Akira Kurosawas The Hidden Fortress (1958):  I haven't been entirely unaware of Kurosawa up until now, having started watching Seven Samurai at least five times but never making it quite through the lot of it, probably due to being very unused to older movies. On the other hand I have also seen Yojimbo previously, on the behest of a friend, which I enjoyed immensely (probably due to it being a shorter, tighter film).   And Hidden Fortress was even better, with it feeling like an extremely well-made, almost modern Adventure Movie filmed with old-time equipment. The story, which was fun with a good mix of both action, drama and comic relief, felt almost secondary to the directing and cinematography which was crazy good.   From the epic shots of scenery to the intense duel between the two generals, the camera always placed itself perfectly in relation to what was happening, never feeling intrusive and always letting you use your eyes and mind to catch up on what is important in the scene, something I've caught up on as I've been watching more Kurosawa.   All in all, I enjoyed this movie for what it was, doing what it set out to do almost perfectly, 8/10.  After the Hidden Fortress, I watched Melvilles Le Samouraï (1967):  I came upon this by pure chance as I was browsing Criterions website. Being kind of hyped on everything Samurai- after the Hidden Fortress, I thought this sounded interesting. And it was, with Delon capturing the cool and grace of a Samurai perfectly in the character of Jef, but in a neo-noir packaging.   The story felt almost minimalist, instead leaving place for atmosphere and the intensity of the situation that Jef finds himself in.  Now, this was (and is) the only Melville I've seen, and so I feel like I'm still too new to him to comment on the direction in any specific sense; but I will at least say that he captured everything from the metro- chase to the opening (which was awesome in setting the mood) perfectly, making the bleak scenery and minimalist story feel as exciting and true-to-life as you could ever want. 8/10.  And after watching Le Samouraï, I was looking for more neo-noir to set my teeth in, and Nolan, being one of my more-liked blockbuster-directors I set my eyes on Following (1998):  And if anything, this movie made me thirst even more for the Nolan that was, and could've been. Just as in Le Samouraï, Following set up a fairly simple story that evolved into something complex, especially due to the sometimes unnecessarily non-linear story telling. Don't get me wrong, it can be used to great effect, but the way a lot of the shots were presented felt very out-of-context even to the non-linear storytelling.   But all this aside, this was a very tense and atmospheric movie, with the black-and-white shots feeling extremely visceral, and the editing never giving away too much of the twist.   And as I said, this makes me thirst for the Nolan that could've been hadn't he instead opted for the more blockbuster-friendly route.  7/10, extremely impressive seeing this was a low-budget, first full-lenght(kinda) feature production.  After this, I wanted more noir, and seeing that I enjoyed Kurosawa immensely, I decided on The Bad Sleep Well (1960):  And here is where I really fell in love with Kurosawa. As we follow Nishi's quests for revenge, masterfully played by Mifune, we get a complex story of corporate corruption, exploring themes such as greed, revenge (obviously), honor and most likely a lot more that I didn't catch.   Just as with The Hidden Fortress the direction was masterful, with the camera once again being unintrusive and observant, letting the viewers eyes and mind do a lot of the work. One scene comes to mind that exemplifies this perfectly; When Nishi is nailing another guy for a small heist he himself pulled. (this was the only video I found of the scene, but Every Frame a Painting is awesome so who cares?).  The way the movie ended was somewhat foreshadowed by the movies title, and yet it felt unexpected.   10/10.  Other movies I saw but for one reason or another didn't feel ready to write anything about (mostly due to needing another viewing) include The Seventh Seal (I need to view more Bergman before I can give a good opinion on this), High and Low (everything I said about The Bad Sleep Well applies to this, yet another masterful movie from Kurosawa, 10/10), Throne of Blood (need another viewing of this, but as of now 8/10, I had a hard time getting excited by a story I already knew), Sanjuro (as with The Hidden Fortress and Yojimbo, awesome movie with a clever plot, 9/10).  Currently watching Lawrence of Arabia, giving it a nights sleep and watching the second part after the Intermission, but loving this movie already. Just. Damn.  Movies I am planning to watch include The Battle for Algiers, Citizen Kane, Ikiru, and Stalker. However, I am looking for any and all suggestions for what to watch next."
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,TrumanB-12,10,Sun Jul 12 18:34:57 2015 UTC,"It Follows (2015) dir. David Robert Mitchell  Was it overhyped? Yes. Was it bad? No. It Follows might be a victim of too much exposure, and I was in the end sort of disappointed, but I can't say it wasn't enjoyable or a good movie. For those uninitiated, It Follows is about young, pretty Jay who becomes infected with an STD demon of sorts and must survive it's creeping attempts to kill her horribly. She and a small group of friends work together to try ensure her safety and thwart the demon. The strongest thing about the plot is how the movie handles it's themes. It's a very mature look at teenage sexuality and I appreciated how it didn't take any sides. I'm not big on messages (I largely don't care) but it's nice to see a horror movie try tackle something deeper than itself. It Follows also successfully pays homage to late 70s/ early 80s horror flicks (especially of the John Carpenter variety) while keeping it's own, unique spirit. The retro synth score is the most obvious one and not only does it sound beautiful, it builds tension very well. The movie also looks pretty nice. Camerawork is excellent with lots of wide lense shots that give the movie an expensive feel, as well as multiple 360° pans. Colours are rather washed out, almost pastel in their nature. Unfortunately the makeup concerning ""It"" is lacking. I won't spoil how ""It"" manifests itself, but it doesn't succeed in being very memorable. Also while Maika Monroe does a very good job in the leading role, the supporting cast is largely forgettable and neither their performances nor how their characters were written were anything extra. In a movie like this which is short on scares, I see it as important that it succeeds in other areas, namely it's screenplay. The script misses so many opportunities for development that it leads to often vast portions of the movie that are nearly pointless and wasted. There might be a scene of characters walking and then the scene fade-cuts  (another homage) because there really isn't anything important there. I felt the director could've been a lot more efficient with his time overall. As for the direction itself, it's the weakest link of this movie imo. I didn't get bored during the movie and it had some entertaining sequences, but it's atmosphere was waning quite often. For a start, very few rules were established for ""It"" and there are actions taken by characters that make little to no sense (sleeping on top of the car). I know stupid teens were a trope of the 80s but it's so out of place here. The scary sequences themselves needed a lot more polish. The reactions of the characters rarely matched what was going on screen and the movie teetered around the threat of ""It"" too much. I don't mind slow burn, I mind when the supposedly creepy parts of a horror movie aren't paced or presented well. It's hard to describe how I feel the director didn't do a good job in that regard without referring to the last scene which takes place at a swimming pool. Good location? Yes. Good creep? No. All in all however I'm glad I saw it and it's certainly the top horror movie of the year for me so far (until i see Unfriended & Insidious 3.)   7.5/10  300: Rise of an empire (2014) dir. Noam Murro  I was a big fan of the first 300, and I heard this one was quite true to it. In some ways it is, but overall it is inferior in every way. Snyder's visually heavy direction is replicated to some degree, and the aesthetic is still there, but it falls short or the true splendor of the original. The movie takes place at a similar period of the ""prequel"", starting earlier but ending later. It follows the Athenian army lead by Themistokles as it faces off against the Persian naval forces commanded by Greek semi-defector Artemisia. Red and gold are replaced here by blue and black and it's much darker in style overall. It's even got more blood. That doesn't equate to being better at all. You still have the trademark Snyder camera swoops, but they don't pack the same punch as the combat is noticeable worse edited and choreographed with weird set pieces and camera placements. Having battles on a ship could have worked out, but instead they often feel contrived. You might see a duel but then you notice the extras are doing nothing meanwhile. The costumes are still fantastic however, even if Artemisia's armour design was a wasted opportunity, and the metal score returns once again. It was fine on the acting front. Sullivan Stapleton doesn't channel the same energy nor charisma of Gerard Butler and his soldiers were also no match for Fassbender or the others, but line delivery was solid and inoffensive. Eva Green as the villain was billed as a shining point of the movie by critics, and whole she was good, I could never buy her as the ruthless, cold, assassin she was meant to be. She was neither menacing nor felt powerful. Strong female character she may be, but little more. This brings me onto the worst part of the movie, namely the writing. In 300 the majority of dialogue was the equivalent of grunts and roars, but in Rise of an Empire, they instead tried to make it more epic in a manner that they failed spectacularly at. It becomes melodramatic and like a soap opera with batches upon batches of pointless dialogue. Pretty bad in that regard. My expectations were not high, and it's still a faithful addition, but despite its strong roots, this movie is just OK.   6.9/10  Moon (2009) dir. Duncan Jones  One of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen. Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) plays an astronaut on the moon who is in charge of looking after the rovers there than collect Helium3 that is used in the now global fusion reactors on Earth, while being kept in company by the intelligent robot GERTY (Kevin Spacey.) For a movie called Moon, it does a brilliant job at showing the named spacial object's landscape, the technology involved in mining there, as well as the simple lifestyle Sam lives. It cost only 5mil$, but due to the impressive practical effects, it looks like it cost ten times the budget. The way it plays with the desolation and loneliness of the location is phenomenal and the designs all looks very real. I'm a sucker for stuff space-related and this hit the nail on the head. The shots of the crater crusted surface and the rovers driving among the moon dust was a sight to behold. From a visual standpoint, it's just pure gold. And what better composer to add to this awe than none other than Clint Mansell? Soft, and twinkly like the stars, he continues to be my favourite composer working. Moon is one of those movies that succeeds in its premise so much because it has a very contained concept. It's tough to talk a lot without spoiling the plot in any way but it was riveting all the way through. It's full of twists and surprises and fully driven by the excellent performances and chemistry between the actors. Each scene bears meaning and it's cut exactly how it needs to be. It's slow and atmospheric with a lot of personality and emotion while keeping that epic and wondrous feel a sci-fi movie of its sort deserves. I can't say more but ""see it!."" This one is a Reddit favourite for good reason.  10/10"
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,TrumanB-12,4,Sun Jul 12 19:42:31 2015 UTC,"The Blair Witch Project (1999) dir. Eduardo Sanchez  The daddy of found footage horror is still to this day a strong representative of the subgenre. It's odd how this movie is almost more of an art film than a horror movie. Sure it's creepy and I was tense the whole ride through, but it's not outright scary so I'd hesitate to call it the scariest/best HORROR movie I've seen. It doesn't really fit into any other genre though. If you're unfamiliar with the plot, it's about three students who decide to document the fabled legend of the titular character in the woods next to a village called Burkitsville. They get lost and stuff gets hectic. It's shot using two different cameras, one in colour and one in b&w that helps us distinguish between who is behind each take. It's got a very slow build up too. The first portion of the movie consists of interviews of the locals and some chitchat between the crew before they head off into the autumn forest. It's odd that I say this, but there is nothing I'd change about this movie. It works so well within its format and it's best suit is that it looks REAL. No fancy FX are here. It seriously looks like the result of an amateur project. Even the actors are irreplaceable. Sure none of them are world class, but casting A list actors wouldn't make any difference. If anything, it would make the movie worse. The relationships are very believable as are the reactions to the strange things that befall the main characters. This is a case where feeling cheap is exactly what the movie needs. No wonder the marketing campaign (read about it, it's the best movie marketing campaign to date) was so successful and 40% of all people who saw it in the theatres thought it was a true story and actual footage of the last moments of three students. What is world class though, is the editing. It's so efficient and precise, always cutting to not make a single moment feel stale or too short. Also what is a a surprise, the shaky cam didn't make me annoyed. Certain recent FFH movies (ahem VHS) have completely spoiled any possibility of tension by seemingly throwing the camera around aimlessly and blurring what's happening. Here, it's used properly. The moments where the picture needs to be clear, the camera stops, and where there needs to be motion, it shakes. The barren, inhospitable woods with dead trees and small creeks actually makes for an interesting location and feels chilly. Another area where TBWP excels at is the entire mythos. It's complete with witches, childmurderers, ritualistic killings and the like. Things that we learn at the beginning of the movie come back subtly to haunt us while we view the movie. There is an additional documentary that expands on those matters and I will be seeing it if I can find it somewhere. The characters unnerving  descent into isolation, fear, and pure anxiety is portrayed exceedingly well for a movie of its type. I'm actually surprised the movie made so much money because it's in many ways very unlike modern horror that drew inspiration from it. It feels weird that I give the movie such a high score, and I don't know if it's exactly recommendable to the vast majority of people, but I feel it is just perfect in what it is.  P.S Read about the making of this movie. It's pretty incredibly how the director approached the project.   10/10  KVIFF 2015  I only managed to be at the festival for a day and caught just three movies, but I'll be giving a short review on each. If anyone would like to know more, just let me know.   The Red Spider  A polish thriller about a young, unhappy guy who meets a murderer with whom he strikes up an unlikely relationship. The strongest aspect of it are the visuals. It's very metallic with a winter hue and great atmospheric lighting all around. It's set during the 70s and it's nice to see a refreshing spin on the grey communist aesthetics of the time. There was a lot of potential with the narrative here, but it ends up being too reliant on interpretation. The movie wants to say a lot about the human condition and our search for approval and value in out lives, but this is only through the mind of the viewer. A lot of nice ideas, but the movie never decides it's genre. It's not a crime mystery movie and it's not a character study. In a movie like this, it hurts to not have a clear objective framework. As a result, the first hour is rather pointless and things only become interesting towards the end when things pick up. The characters are all sorely underwritten despite the good effort by the actors.  6.7/10  Box  A Romanian film about ""boxing, theatre, and stalking."" Genre wise it's somewhere along the lines of a coming of age drama. Essentially a 17yo poor gypsy boy (and going to a gym to practice boxing nearly each day) tries to connect with a middleclass dancing teacher whose dreams of becoming an actress are ever waning. We follow each character through their respective careers, their everyday lives, and through their occasional encounters. It's extremely engaging and well written with a lot of punch. Certainly the best movie I saw at the festival.  8.6/10  Places  A Czech existentialist piece with a dash of crime drama that is somewhat reminiscent of other recent Czech movies like Wild Bees (Divoké Včely) in it's interesting portrayal of the banality of the lives of the youth. Set in an industrial backdrop of a city, it's about 2 young (seemingly every single movie at KVIFF this year was about troubled young people) guys and a girl who each have their own personal problems concerning parents, uncertainty, boredom etc and how they spend most of their time messing around and pissing off people. Towards the end there is a whole situation with their grandfathers killing a guy a long time ago, and the girl's insanely wealthy father going haywire. It's good but it's not the best of the multitude of similar Czech movies. My country is in desperate need of a breakout director since Milos Forman has stopped making stuff.  7.3/10"
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,cattymills,11,Sun Jul 12 19:43:26 2015 UTC,"Aliens (1986) directed by James Cameron  Aliens is a different (but undoubtedly related) animal than Alien. Whereas the first one went for the gritty horror, vaguely psychosexual vibes -- this one goes pure, clean action movie. Really darn well I might add. I thought that there were some tonal imbalances in Alien—there are none here. Every inch of this film is cohesively geared towards being that kind of film. What stops this from being a disappointing, 'cash grab' sequel surely must be Cameron. The fawning over weaponry and the lovingly portrayed machismo (and sometimes misogyny) of the marines doesn't come across as that normally does, rather it's presented with an infectious, boyish glee that makes those things somehow innocent. The cigar-chomping and one-liners could be embarrassing, yet ""stop your grinnin' and drop your linen"" exudes only glee. Something similar goes for the subtext. Alien seems to me to be at least partly about the failure of man and technology. In Aliens (wo)man and technology undoubtedly triumph. Yet, Cameron makes it more nuanced than that. Corporations are negatively portrayed and the victory is only just. Like the rest of the film, a ""man over nature"" victory in the subtext is mechanically expected in a sequel given the green light based on the big bucks it would surely bring in, but, also like the rest of the film, Cameron makes it more than that.  P.S. This is supremely paced. Aliens is long, almost two-and-a-half hours, and yet—despite there being no real set pieces—my attention never wavered. Cameron obeyed ""show, don't tell"" here. We learn about characters through their actual actions onscreen and the differentiating of them is left to the actors. Because of this, the film's never bogged down by exposition. It's always kept moving by meaningful, informative action.  ★★★1/2  Alien: Resurrection (1997) directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet  Aliens has a certain boyishness about it that serves itself very well. Alien: Resurrection replaces that with a certain 'teenagerness.' And, as one can expect, it does not serve the film very well. There's a callousness shown towards human life and some embarrassing attempts at being cool that are in no way endearing like the ones in Aliens are. Moreover, it's stupid (more than once spectacularly so) at times in its efforts to keep the story moving and sometimes for no reason at all. And yet, I'd still say I liked Resurrection It's hard to do those titular aliens, loose and steadily killing off people, wrong—while there are a lot more lapses in feeling than the other films in the series, the film has its fair share of tension and palpable stakes. Furthermore, the film has real style. The confrontational performances; the photography, with its dark orange glow; and the direction—full of intense close-ups, low angles, and zooms—do well to give Resurrection a distinct, aggressive edge that meshes well with the teenagerness.  P.S. Joss Whedon has said that the film got his script all wrong, and I have to say my opinion differs from his. The script is by far the worst part of the film. Jean-Pierre Jeunet & co. did well to create an identifiable style that could fit in with the immaturity in the script and still form an effective movie.  ★★★  Before Sunset (2004) directed by Richard Linklater  Before Sunset feels almost a big ungainly at the beginning, but I'm pretty sure that's by design. The film wants to take us from awkwardness and have us witness the steady change to passion. I don't think it strictly succeeds in that way, as after the that initial awkwardness fades away the the tone pretty much stays the same—it doesn't escalate—for the majority of the remainder of the duration. But, I was nonetheless enraptured by the conversations for all the reasons the Before trilogy has been praised and the sheer stakes—real-time!—of it all. And hell, the film gets where it wants to in the end. Before Sunset may not get there quite how it wants to, but that doesn't matter because the scene where the passion is rekindled—nay, set furiously ablaze once more—in her apartment is sublime, magical, memorable, and I don't know how many more effusive descriptors. Pure cinema.  ★★★★  Before Midnight (2013) directed by Richard Linklater  In Before Midnight, Ethan Hawke's and Julie Delpy's characters have been married for a while, and it shows—the car talk at the beginning, perhaps the series' best single conversation, is brimful of familiarity: unimaginable chemistry; casual intimacy, intimacy on a level not yet seen with these two, by the way; and lightning fast changes in topic, from lighthearted to serious in a flash. However, as also comes with familiarity, there is plenty of distance. We see Hawke and Delpy separate or with other people far more than we ever have before. Of course, there's also friction. The fight is so apt in its portrayal of the passion and multitudinous issues that arise in a relationship over time that I can't give an objective assessment of it. And, befitting the rest of what I said, this also feels like the most wise (not necessarily best) of the Before series. For once, it seems like Linklater wants to impart in us—what seems like perhaps the conclusion he's drawn from this long, long relationship—not an experience or a feeling, but rather something like a lesson. A guide.  ★★★★  A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) directed by Steven Spielberg  Rosenbaum sums it up best: ""I find A.I. so fascinating, affecting, and provocative that I don’t much care whether it’s a masterpiece or not"".  ★★★★★"
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,RetroGmr,10,Sun Jul 12 15:20:06 2015 UTC,"I saw some pretty damn good ones.  El Topo MASTERPIECE. I loved it. Just seen it today. I wasn't even planing to see it today, I just wanted to see if everything worked fine since I bought the thing on some site I wasn't sure was safe, but before they said the first word I was hooked. Just...intrigued. It wasn't the surrealist film I thought it'd be but I got something better. A funny, depressing, bizzare and just plain fucked up adventure with a great story (there's actually a story if you overlook all the batshit crazy stuff going on). The soundtrack, cinematography and philosophic dialogue are just icing on the cake. I don't wanna spoil too much but this film goes into my top 10. Not for everyone though. 10/10  Inception Really good, but not what I wanted. I was hoping for some more ""dream oriented action (hallway scene)"" rather than just plain action and I still don't know why everybody is so afraid of limbo if you can escape it just by killing yourself, but whatever. I didn't have much trouble following the film but it was still an interesting idea with great writting, awesome looking effects and good casting choices combined with the great acting. It does suck the Cobb was the only characted with any depth in him, I didn't see the film for a character study, I watched it for badass sci-fi action and a twisty, mind bending story. 8.5/10  Sex Tape Brilliant comedy. The casting choices combined with great acting and knee slapping, hillarious jokes were just perfect. Just kidding, it was terrible, shit timing, doesn't know when to stop, bad acting, bad writting. 1+ for Cameron Diaz's ass 1/10  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas LOVE IT. The book was better IMO and I wished for some more trippy drug scenes. I don't watch alot of comedies but this one is just amazing. Great acting and writting. Camera shots were perfect and I genuinely laughed at some of the scenes. 9.5-10  Persona To be completly honest, I don't understand why The Seventh Seal is so popular. I heard it had a lot to do with religion, something I'm not really interested in so I guess I just missed the symbolism :( Persona on the other hand I loved. To be honest again...I didn't really get it, and I heard many people think it's pretty easy to get, I dunno. That doesn't mean I didn't like it. I loved the story (right up until it went batshit), the acting, the writting and most of all, I loved all the shots. The film is amazing, but I'm gonna have to watch it again 10/10  I also rewatched Reservoir Dogs but I don't really feel like talking about it, other than the fact that I had my first lucid dream with Tim Roth that night.... 9/10"
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,afewthoughtsonfilm,3,Sun Jul 12 19:12:12 2015 UTC,"It's always great seeing how people react to Jodorowsky's work.  He's one of the great, unsung heroes of the early 70's (though his work after that, particularly Santa Sangre and The Dance of Reality, is excellent, too).  Earlier this year, I had the good fortune to screen El Topo in my Western genre class (the professor didn't have anything planned and so I suggested we do this masterpiece) and the response was exactly what I expected.  For many, it was too bizarre and weird to be appreciated, but for those who were able to look past the bizarre things, they all agreed it was one of the most important things they had ever experienced.  Have you seen The Holy Mountain?  For many people, myself included, that is his masterpiece - I consider it in my top 5 movies for sure.  It's even more bizarre than El Topo, but to me offers even more in terms of philosophy and spirituality."

I was hooked the whole time and, before I knew it, I was smiling a stupid smile like I had just found what I had been missing in my life. When the ending came, my body and brain melted into a puddle of rainbow goo. After I put myself back together, I realized I had just underwent Jodorowsky's ritualistic proselytization into his freakish occult and I've been fully converted.   El Topo and Santa Sangre are not as crazy by Jodorowsky standards but they stand out when compared to films in their respective genres because, I don't know exactly but it might be the surreal spice he adds to his films, the low budget/underground feel, and just the imagery! His films are big melting pots of contrasting, conflicting, and provocative imagery. I can't explain very well but everyone has to try Jodorowsky for themselves, he is a genius madman."

TrueFilm,3d0l0f,PieBlaCon,3,Mon Jul 13 02:29:50 2015 UTC,"Quite a bit. All first-timers too. Let's do a rundown:  Boyhood (2014) - This film is quite remarkable when you've watched 2 hours of it and you stop to think that the young boy from the beginning is now a teen within the same movie. Seems basic, but it makes for a fascinating premise. Complaints that the story arc is too normal seem invalid to me. What's great about this movie is how realistic everything is. There are moments in the film where you might think something could go horribly wrong, because other movies have trained you to think that way, but when nothing bad happens, it makes total sense within the context of this film. I will say I enjoyed the 1st half of the film more because once Mason is a teen, I'm just reminded of how annoying teenagers are. Also, I found Patricia Arquette's character totally unlikable. She has this woe is me attitude about everything which is usually brought on by her own doing. Ethan Hawke did a great job, though. 3.5/5  Gone Girl (2014) - Wow. I put this one off for a bit, because I'm not overly fond of Ben Affleck, but he served the movie quite well. He's totally smug and it works. I had no idea where this movie was going scene to scene. Every character is pretty despicable in their own way, a testament to Fincher, Flynn, and the actors. I liked the ending, also. Not everything needs to be completely resolved. 4/5  Moonrise Kingdom (2012) - My first Wes Anderson movie, and I really enjoyed it. I love his style, his writing, and the performances of all of the actors. There are a few bizarre moments in the film that don't make sense, but they didn't bother me for more than a minute. 4/5  The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) - Right after Moonrise Kingdom ended, I fired up Anderson's latest film, and I loved it even more. Ralph Fiennes was fantastic, along with the rest of the cast (though young Zero was just average). Another well shot film with witty writing and a story that kept me quite engaged. Probably my favorite film from 2014 (or tied with Inherent Vice). 4.5/5  Whiplash (2014) - This one was interesting. I was worried Miles Teller would ruin this movie for me (I hadn't seen him in anything but trailers for ""world's craziest party"" movies), but he did well. Of course JK Simmons is the standout. I think if I was a drummer, I'd be able to appreciate this movie more, because even though I understand what timing is, I think knowing what exactly was wrong would add more. A fine film even if the overall arc goes nowhere (not convinced the ending means anything). 3.5/5"
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,KennyKatsu,2,Sun Jul 12 22:16:04 2015 UTC,"If you loved Moonrise And Budapest, I would continue on his filmography starting with Fantastic Mr. Fox (the film before Moonrise) and continue backwards to his older works.

TrueFilm,3d0l0f,lordhadri,9,Mon Jul 13 01:06:52 2015 UTC,"As always, you can ask me for additional thoughts.  White Dog Samuel Fuller, 1982: My grandmother also had a racist dog, but it didn’t have supervillain powers like this one. Fuck you, R2-D2!  The Man Who Wasn’t There Joel Coen&Ethan Coen, 2001: The Coens have made so many popular movies that this one ends up being overlooked. But it’ll get you your fix for craggy actors with gravelly voices philosophizing about nihilism. It also asks you to sympathize with a main character who isn’t very smart, isn’t very attractive, and isn’t a very good person, and we get to watch what he does when his best intentions go awry.   Donovan’s Reef John Ford, 1963: This John Wayne romantic comedy will make you want to depart for an island paradise and never leave. Lee Marvin playing with his train set is one of the most adorable things I’ve ever seen.   The Fighter David O. Russell, 2010: More Boogie Nights than Raging Bull, thanks to Wahlberg’s presence. My least favorite of Russell’s movies so far, but not without its charms. I kinda wish Bale had gotten an Oscar for American Hustle instead though.  Mad Max George Miller, 1979: It has a reputation for not being very good, and it’s true that you won’t get a satisfying straightforward narrative from it. But I was impressed by how well photographed and directed it is anyway. It’s not the best Mad Max movie but it complements the shared mythology of the other three, giving us the origin for a lot of what we see later in the universe. Gibson’s performance is very good too.  Rewatch - The Road Warrior George Miller, 1981: The Blu-Ray release of this isn’t very good, and the film itself seems unrestored. Even so, seeing it in higher definition with proper subtitles is like seeing a great action movie for the first time.   Rewatch - The Third Man Carol Reed, 1949 (Theatrical 4k presentation): I think I’ve discovered that I don’t like this movie.  This week’s ultra-long getting-it-over-with movie is:  Hoop Dreams Steve James, 1994: Distant and less ambitious for the first hour but ultimately exhilarating like any fictional sports movie can be. It reminds me of that last year of high school where the pathways and narratives you’re given about how to achieve in America are totally baffling and not always very helpful. Encouraging children to be dedicated to pro sports is especially problematic but the real victory, clearly, is for the parents getting their children through high school at all."

It got weird in the ending where I want to see Orson Welles the movie star get away from the cops, but I'm not sure that's what the movie wants me to think. That contradiction is what makes the chase scene exciting to people, I think...but there's no real reason to root for the character.  I might've found the dialogue scenes less unwatchable if I hadn't picked the echo spot in my theater though."

I've had a great week, but I'm currently in a foreign country and didn't have time to write my full thoughts. If this comment gets enough attention I'll gladly elaborate on the many great (or not so great) films I watched.    City Lights (1931) - Dir. Charlie Chaplin: I haven't seen many of Chaplin's films, but I doubt any of them will top this: my favourite silent film of all time. The ending is heart-stoppingly beautiful and the comedy is as great as you would expect. One of the greatest films ever made.  10/10    Anger Management (2003) - Dir. Peter Segal: Not even Jack Nicholson could save this meandering comedy. It offers a few laughs and isn't hard to watch, but bland direction and a blander script prevent it from being anything more than a time-killer.  4/10    Modern Times (1936) - Dir. Charlie Chaplin: A wonderful ending for the tramp. Visually inventive and funnier (if not better) than City Lights. The factory scenes are absolutely brilliant.  10/10    Seven Chances (1925) - Dir. Buster Keaton: These silent comedies are absolutely delightful. This film contains one of the fastest and funniest chase sequences I've ever seen.  8.5/10    Charlie Wilson's War (2007) - Dir. Mike Nichols: An expectedly witty script by Aaron Sorkin is enchanted by excellent performances and Mike Nichols elegant and energetic direction. It's not Nichol's best but is a fine swan-song to his legendary career.  9/10    Gravity (2013) - Dir. Alfonso Caurón: Visually stunning and emotionally fulfilling. Some ridiculously cheesy dialogue brings it down a bit for me.  8.5/10    Captain Phillips (2013) - Dir. Paul Greengrass: This is the third time I've watched the film, and strangely it was the most emotional experience. I actually cried during a scene at the end. Paul Greengrass uses his trademark handheld camerawork to great effect here, infusing the film with a claustrophobic tension that really pays off. Tom Hanks is excellent and I love how it portrays the Pirates as not merciless villains but people doing what they must to survive. A rather painful opening scene is my only main critisism.  8.5/10    While We're Young (2015) - Dir. Noah Baumbach: Very sharp and observant comedy. The performances are great (though subtle) and it poses some interesting questions about the ethics of filmmaking. The plot got a little convoluted at times but I throughly enjoyed the wit and characters.  8/10    Foxcatcher (2014) - Dir. Bennett Miller: Brilliant. It's a shame that some viewers were expecting a huge event movie after the vast amounts of critical praise. It's a slow-burn, quiet, thoughtful drama, filled with excellent performances and tension.  10/10    American Sniper (2014) - Dir. Clint Eastwood: It's a competent action film but a rather sub-par drama. The battle sequences are intense, well shot and well staged, but by focusing on the war and action it lacks an emotional punch. The characters are rather two-dimensional and thus it's hard for the audience to really care much. Technically sound but quite hollow.  6.5/10"

TrueFilm,3d0l0f,EeZB8a,6,Sun Jul 12 19:13:39 2015 UTC,"Mr Hulot’s Holiday Directed by Jacques Tati (1953)- After loving the delightful and funny Jour de Fete I was a little let down by Tati’s cinematic debut of his Mr Hulot character. Similarly to Jour de Fete it’s a gentle comedy about the people in a specific place over the course of a day or two, though here we do follow Mr Hulot a bit more than anyone else. Where the film didn’t grab me as much is hard to pinpoint but in essence I just found myself laughing a whole lot less. A few bits got me but the rest of the time I was watching pretty stony faced. Tati certainly shows off how much of a master of choreography he is here. He’s even able to imbue the sea itself with comedic timing. Maybe it’s growing up loving Mr Bean that has me ready to be a little underwhelmed by Hulot. While Tati’s skills as a filmmaker far outweigh those of everyone combined that worked on Mr Bean it still doesn’t make me laugh as much. Sometimes that’s not a deal breaker but here it does make things a little ambling. I found myself interested or invested for pockets of time while the rest of the time just in that distanced place of liking what I’m literally seeing in terms of cinematography, blocking, etc, while not feeling anything at all. Jour de Fete even when it wasn’t laugh out loud funny had a warmth that carried me through it. I just loved being in that town with those people. Little moments give a such greater picture of what life there is like. And though this has those elements it’s a little more focused on Hulot so everything else seems more like a source of comedy for him than anything else. I hope Tati’s successive Hulot films don’t disappoint me like this because I want to feel how Jour de Fete made me feel again. Again there are still hilarious moments and how he stages stuff is impeccable but I found myself only intermittently interested.   Spy Directed by Paul Feig (2015)- Now this was a film with the opposite problem. Barely a lick of cinematic imagination in the piece but boy was it funny. I didn’t care for Bridesmaids but all the good reviews for Spy had me intrigued, and they were right. Spy is stuffed with jokes so plenty don’t land but more land than don’t and I was laughing lots throughout. The thing also acts as an interesting, and surprisingly self aware, commentary on Melissa McCarthy’s career. At times it goes a little far into “swears are funny” though the delivery often saves it and again for every joke that fails two better ones take its place. It’s funny fluff and if Feig gets better with his camerawork he could make a brilliant film and not just a good series of jokes.   A Nightmare on Elm Street Directed by Wes Craven (1984)- For a big horror fan I’ve got some major blind spots (also including Friday the 13th) because when I first got into horror I watched a couple of the classics then jumped right to the weird stuff. I can see why this blew up so much but having seen it parodied or in documentaries so many times it had little fresh to show me. A very well made film though and compared to many of the horror flicks of the 80s it shines even brighter. It has an awareness and intelligence that often feels lacking in 80s teen horror and keeps its focus on the horror of dreams and parents not understanding. As a kid I would terrify myself imaging what was in these types of films based on the covers in the video shop and what braver kids said of it, so it couldn’t really help not being so affecting. But it has some really fun effects and a great imagination that keeps it from ever dragging.   Lone Star Directed by John Sayles (1996)- A skeleton and badge are found in the desert near a town near the border of Mexico kickstarting an investigation that has Chris Cooper’s sheriff looking into the past of his town and family. It’s got a bit of Touch of Evil to it though that’s an unflattering comparison as Lone Star is comparatively drained of any style. It does have one motif though that gives it some visual distinctiveness. Many times as we go into a flashback we’ll do so in one shot. Pan round from Chris Cooper to his younger self and stuff like that. Very simply the film builds the theme of the past dictating and bleeding into the present into how it looks perfectly. These kind of touches that say so much that these things rarely need addressed to make the rest of the film seem much more direct and straight forward though. For the most part it works though. It’s tightly written and juggles its many characters and plot lines well but it never got to that next level for me, it was always consistently good but it never made me feel anything beyond recognising what it was doing. Good performances all around too. There are plenty more invigorating small town mystery tales and this doesn’t set itself apart enough to really have me gripped. Solid stuff but feels more like watching a well done tv show than any of its comparable film counterparts.   The Blob Directed by Chuck Russell (1988)- Another 80s horror and one I ended up enjoying more. Nightmare on Elm Street is probably the better film in that it more fully crystallises its ideas and has interesting camerawork beyond the effects shots but here I had more fun. The Blob keeps moving at a decent clip, has some crazy gnarly effects, and unlike a lot of other 80s horror films it knows which of its characters are likeable. A lot of 80s horror movies (and horror movies in general to an extent) have the issue of just being full of either boring or terrible people but this film has a sense of what’s too far and what’s not. Even Nightmare kind of had this problem as the “bad boy” character randomly pulls a knife on Johnny Depp at one point for little reason. His girlfriend is apparently fine with it as they immediately go to bed and it doesn’t really get brought up again but for me anyone who pulls a knife on someone for pretty much anything is a garbage human being. You pull a knife on someone you’re not a rebel you’re a psycho. Here the rebel rides a bike, smokes cigs, drinks beer, doesn’t like authority. He’s the kind of kid you can see parents and adults of the community thinking is a bad egg but he’s not so awful that we too can never like him. There are lots of little things it does right and it delivers thrills as much as laughs due to the slightly-hokey performances/writing and the audacity of its kills. I had a lot of fun and didn’t have to forgive a bunch of things to do so. It also has better (aka not troubling) gender dynamics and such than the next film I watched this week."
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,Inception_025,6,Sun Jul 12 14:31:18 2015 UTC,"Jurassic World Directed by Colin Trevorrow (2015)- Yeesh. Hearing Trevorrow is rumoured for Episode IX is baffling because I barely see a director in this film let alone one with the kind of personality or skill as Rian Johnson. If we have to see Trevorrow direct a Johnson script it’ll be like watching a beautiful marionette operated by a blind dog. Maybe I’m being a little harsh but I don’t think I’ve been as bummed by a blockbuster since I last dared to watch a Transformers movie. I am retroactively giving way more props to Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. I thought that had a dull look to it but I guess I forgot how bland films can get. Now I love dinosaurs, have since I was a kid, so I should be somewhat easy to please. Hell, Dawn had me riveted when it just showed the amazing cg on the orang-utan and I’m hardly an ape-head so seeing dinosaurs well realised could have me enjoying myself for those sections at least. Except this is not cg on the level of Dawn, nor is it directed by someone who seems to have any semblance of upping the tactility of cg creations through performances and the environment. Matt Reeves might not be a great visual stylist but the guy knows how to give some life to cg. He’s working with mo-cap so he’s got a little help in terms of people being able to react and emote but even little things like how he makes his environments very natural and real and how he directs his actors make it work better. He really brought out performances that nail the uncomfortable fear of being around a dangerous animal. Even though Jurassic World is essentially all about people being afraid of dangerous animals not once did I believe any of it. Dinosaurs looked like cartoons and people reacted as vaguely as in the Star Wars prequels. A kid by a gate is told “Don’t turn your back to them (raptors)” and looks around seeing one right at the gate. Now he’s close enough that if it swipe with its arm it’d slash him but he barely reacts when he turns round. It’s like he had no idea what he was looking at, and almost every dino-human interaction is like that. The films also a mess of stories and themes it picks up and drops all the way through. It’s a self-loathing blockbuster about how much blockbusters like itself are, it’s also about two boys learning to find strength in each other, it’s also about a woman learning to stop being such a workaholic and find a man to lean on and a love for kids, it’s about the exploitation of nature, it’s about a lot of crap that it barely does anything with and what it does do is often questionable. It even has its Clark and Lois making out on ground zero moment but in an even more baffling fashion. The Blob even handled a similar moment better. Right after horrible near-death stuff has happened and it’s finally over the lead characters run to each other for a big hug. They’ve just seen people die and have nearly died themselves so making out is clearly not appropriate or even where their mind is because y’know, horrible deaths and all that. It’s a desperate hug that shows how their relationship has developed without having to be grossly direct about it. Everything about Jurassic World falls flat. Even the stuff that’s so stupid I should be able to have fun with is so dull that it just bothers me. And the more I think about it the less flattering I become. Like Bryce Dallas Howards character gets crap from everyone yet we see her do more directly heroic things than Chris Pratt but since he acts more heroic he gets all the props. There’s also the well-publicised crazy death that’s just weird more than anything and like everything else if you probe into it the intent looks nastier and nastier. Now The Lost World isn’t great either but I still remember a couple of moments from that and even a shot or two, but I could barely describe a shot to you from this. I could tell you what happened but not how it happened unless it’s directly referencing Jurassic Park visually. Well Jurassic World I guess you’re actually pretty warranted in hating yourself you humourless, dull, cgi-splosion, that makes the Marvel filmography look as varied and distinctive as Martin Scorsese’s.   Shutter Island (Re-watch) Directed by Martin Scorsese (2010)- Speaking of Scorsese. After reading a recent Birth Movies Death article about the film it had it knocking around my brain and it was a decent re-watch. It’s a film that’s made to be seen again. Not because it’s overly complex but because its somewhat silly premise is well realised by the world of the film from moment one. It’s Scorsese doing good pulp but it didn’t have me impressed as the last couple times I saw it. Something about it didn’t quite click even though I liked how clever it is in some ways, the simple little ways it communicates dream states or a warping psychology. But, even though it works well on re-watch in terms of how little world-building moments land it’s less effective elsewhere. It means seeing the same long straightforward explanations again and the dialogue only occasionally pops. Good film though. You can see Scorsese further exploring world building (really more world expansion) through cg environments which he kind of nails in Wolf of Wall Street but here that can be a little shaky. Good music as well but like the rest of the film has become less affecting with each viewing. Seeing something that actually had an understanding of how to use the tools of cinema was a breath of fresh air though after that void Jurassic World."
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,monkeyd_ace,4,Sun Jul 12 14:31:24 2015 UTC,"I've said this before but I'll reiterate it. To paraphrase Jonathan Rosenbaum, one of the worst things that you can do when you approach Tati's oeuvre is assume that you will laugh in his movies. I know this seems contradictory, since Tati is clearly drawing on the tradition of Chaplin, Keaton, and the other slapstick cinematic greats of his time. But Tati works best when he is not going for immediate laughs, but rather for quiet, slightly chucklesome observations. To find the laughs is fruitless; Tati doesn't particularly care if you find the gags funny, all he cares about is if you have fun immersing yourself in the logic of each of his films' worlds.  Roger Ebert had similar misgivings when he saw Les Vacances de M. Hulot as a lad, finding it devoid of humor. Then he rewatched it sometime in the late 90s, and found it dazzling; once he got used to the world, he laughed endlessly:   When I saw the film a second time, the wonderful thing was, it was like returning to the hotel. It wasn't like I was seeing the film again; it was like I was recognizing the people from last year. There's the old couple again (good, they made it through another year). The waiter (where does he work in the winter?). And the blond girl (still no man in her life; maybe this is the summer that...)"

That was the difference though. I didn't find myself as enjoyably immersed in this world as in Jour de Fete's. I did like the holiday retreat atmosphere but found myself unmoved in most ways. I think the difference may have even been that Hulot and his misunderstandings is the source of almost all the little problems or goofs that happen while in Jour everyone played a part. Other people play a part but more often for reactions or those little observational moments, but he's the main disturbance. I think I may've just preferred Jour de Fetes presentation of an event affecting people in a town rather than one man affecting people in a town for some reason.   Will keep that in mind for the next ones though."
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,LuigiVanPeebles,3,Sun Jul 12 15:40:53 2015 UTC,"The River directed by Jean Renoir (1951)★★★★★ What stood out to me with The River was the emotional reaction I had. It immediately made me think of two other movies that have a similar effect on me which are Paths of Glory and 12 Angry Men. What these films all share is the overwhelming sense of emotional truth about humanity that makes me cry upon every viewing. I cannot recommend this film enough and will soon be watching more of Renoir's work.  Shortbus directed by John Cameron Mitchell (2006) ★★★★★ I think many people might dislike this film because it incorporates real sex, homosexual and heterosexual. It is not pornographic but is about the sexual journey and the immense pain and joy we all experience. It is beautiful and the soundtrack was excellent, with songs from my favorite band Animal Collective. The use of computer animation helped elevate the film to a higher level and visually explain what cannot be done otherwise.   The Bridge directed by Eric Steel (2006) ★★★★ This documentary explores what is in the mind of the thousands of people who commit suicide by jumping off of The Golden Gate Bridge. The interviews with friends and family members of people who had committed suicide and one man who jumped and survived are eye opening and fascinating. The common thread is that most friends and family members were not surprised when they found out that their friend/relative has committed suicide, as though they had been drawn to death and did not fit into our reality in which most of us accept.  Lessons of Darkness directed by Werner Herzog (1995)★★★★★ This is by far one of my favorite Herzog films. It is all visuals of the aftermath of the first Gulf War set to classical music. The images are absolutely stunning and intense simultaneously."
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,Smells_Like_Victory,3,Sun Jul 12 20:33:02 2015 UTC,"The Cokeville Miracle (2015),  T.C. Christensen ★★  This reminded me of Ride the Thunder, another 2015 film whose story pulled me to the theater, and the execution was for the most part hard to watch. In TCM, when the elementary school actors give the memorable performances, and you cringe when the adults try their hand and fail, you know the film has problems. I will say that with this true story, I was glued to my seat through the credits. Do not hit ff or eject or exit the theater until the credits end. No one in the theater where I saw it did.  Monk with a Camera (2014), Guido Santi  ★★  I went in completely blind to this library dvd. I actually have zero renewals as there is a line to see this. I will make a special trip to return this turd so they can have it. The only saving grace for me was the photos he took. You can have the Lama, with the flowing robes, striking..., and Richard Gere. So I jumped ship in Hong Kong...  nevermind.  Slow West (2015), John Maclean ★★★  Unusual cinematography for a western, but it works. Nothing neat and tidy about SW - and that alone made this a worthwhile net flix dvd queue up.  Julia (2008),  Erick Zonca ★★★★  I don't know how I found out about this sleeper. I think it had to do with Tilda Swinton - and I was in. Though my 2008 top 10 list is pretty tight, Julia does drop in at #11. Made me think about Mel Gibson's Get the Gringo, and the over the border Babel segment, and the recent Wild Tales.  Zero Motivation (2014),  Talya Lavie ★★★★  There's an interview in the making of supplement on the Zero Motivation dvd where Talya Lavie reflects on her time in the IDF (Israel Defense Forces), and she says when asked what she did during her compulsory service she replies I was a pilot. She continues on a bit then says of course I was a secretary.  Ebert.com's reviewer Godfrey Cheshire places ZM along the lines of Catch 22 and MAS*H in the first sentence of the write up. I would add Three Kings and Stripes.   Elena (2011), Andrey Zvyagintsev ★★★★★  Andrey Zvyagintsev's third film, I've also seen his first and latest; The Return (2003) and Leviathan (2014). From the three I've seen, I have to hand it to his sticking with Mikhail Krichman's cinematography.  From the opening shot of Elena... Every now and then I get a damaged dvd that starts freezing, and I had to glance down at the counter to see that the scene was playing normally - until I sensed the light getting brighter, then some movement in the foreground, on a branch, to the right. Then you see the reflection on the glass and you know something you didn't when the film started.  I would be surprised if Zvyagintsev wasn't influenced by Chantal Akerman's Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles.  Several rewatches:  A Perfect World (1993), Clint Eastwood ★★★★  My Dinner with André (1981), Louis Malle ★★★★★  From my André Gregory & Wallace Shawn: 3 Films Criterion Collection 50 percent off Barnes and Noble purchase.

TrueFilm,3d0l0f,afewthoughtsonfilm,3,Sun Jul 12 21:11:31 2015 UTC,"Newsies directed by Kenny Ortega (1992) ★★1/2  Newsies is alright. I mean, if you have a craving for a new age old fashioned musical this is probably right up your alley. It has all the studio sets, the great choreography, and the nice looking camerawork that you’d expect from a golden age Hollywood musical, except it’s a Disney movie from the 90s and it doesn’t have all the heart that the classics had. Some of the tunes are catchy, some are instantly forgettable. I don’t think I’ll ever forget tunes like “Santa Fe” or “Seize the Day” but I can’t remember anything else from the film. It was alright, it was a cool and flashy Disney picture made in the style of a golden age musical, but through the film you just know that you should really be seeing this on Broadway instead of on your TV screen.  Into the Wild directed by Sean Penn (2007) ★★★1/2  I definitely have a bit of a soft spot for movies that heavily feature a lot of scenery. I love beautiful imagery in films, and Into the Wild has a lot of that, it’s just one scenic location after another. Every shot is beautifully composed and framed on top of that, so it turns out to be one amazing looking movie. It is also a great analysis of an extremely mentally ill boy, it shows us the inner workings of someone who is able to cut himself off from everyone he has ever loved so easily and just walk into the wild, alone, with no training, expecting to come out alright on the other end. It is both a celebration of living life on the edge, and a cautionary tale about not being a total dumbass while you do it. My one problem with the film is that it seems to get its messages mixed up sometimes, and even in the end when we should have lost all respect for Christopher, it still wants to make us feel for him and love him. His death was not a tragedy, it was inevitable, he lived life to the fullest and then walked into his death. Christopher McCandless’s life is not one to envy. He did so many amazing things in his life, but he was naive. Very good movie, and entertaining too, but a film that “misunderstood youth” like Christopher will misunderstand. It is far too easy to watch this movie and come away with the message that life is meant to be lived as a vagabond, and a short life well lived is the best life. That’s really not what it’s trying to do, and I don’t think they get the point across as well as they could have.  rewatch - Fargo directed by Joel Coen (1996) ★★★★  The more times I give Coen films I wasn’t too hot on the first time a second chance, the more I believe what people say about Coen brothers films. You really need two viewings to appreciate it all. I didn’t dislike Fargo before this watch, but I didn’t really like it either. It was totally okay and unspectacular. But of course you have to at least give Coen films two tries, and on round two I loved it. It was amazing, quirky, satirical, tense and unexpected. Even though I’d seen it before, it felt brand new on this viewing because there were so many subtle things I’d missed before, and the plot really defies all formula. One thing I’ve come to expect in the Coen Brothers’ nihilistic dark comedies is that they love making comedy and plot development out of unexpected and unrealistic events, which leads to their stories being very hard to predict. Also, William H Macy and Steve Buscemi really blew me away this time around, still not fully buying into the Frances McDormand buzz but she did impress me more this time. Seeing this just really makes me think that I need to give Barton Fink, A Serious Man and Inside Llewyn Davis another shot."
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,Smells_Like_Victory,2,Sun Jul 12 15:05:13 2015 UTC,"Au Hasard Balthazar (1966)  My 5th Bresson film, and honestly, I was scared for a bit. It's almost impossible to get Bresson on your 1st time. Bresson's pretty much the antithesis to modern film making as well as a counter to silent film theatre. It's safe to say that Au Hasard Balthazar is my favorite Bresson film easily. It is a movie about the life of a Donkey, from beginning to end. The movie can be about many things: it can be about human cruelty, existentialism, it can be a tragedy (Death of a Salesman variation), it can be a character study. The clear difference between this and most other movies is that it's up to the viewers. The movie isn't one definite thing because it leaves everything up to the viewer. This is why the characters are supposedly emotionless. This is why symbolism is kept to a minimum. This is why the plot feels so bare bones. It gives the audience the freedom to choose: to interpret the characters, to insert their opinions, to insert their conflict, to insert their choices.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone but think of a Bresson movie like a painting: It's up to you as to what it means.  Tropa de Elite and Tropa de Elite 2  I've already voiced my opinions on the 1st so I'll go with the 2nd. It's necessary to watch both movies back to back. Both movies focus on the Elite Squad and its attempts to quell down crime. One solution suggested in the 1st movie was to implement a sort of fascist force of elite soldiers--devoid of corruption--that will use torture to meet its ends. The 1st movie was met with controversy because it offered what seemed like an unpersuasive answer to a volatile topic.   The 1st movie was, instead, a prelude to a bigger problem that's addressed in the 2nd movie. The 2nd movie felt like a more mature take on the 1st movie. The 1st movie felt amateur in both its themes and its camera work--with shaky cam dominating the run, over the top violence, and a one sided opinion on a topic that needs multiple perspectives. The 2nd movie offered a broader scope to the original. It was bigger, it was better, it was smarter, and it was more tense. The main character of the 1st felt one-dimensional--as if he's all to accepting of fascism. The 2nd movie has him grow up and realize that this is not the case. It's fascinating seeing the 2nd movie mature and it's a must to see both movies in order just to see the progression.  Hard to be a God (2013)  Boy did this make Satantango look like a fun time in Disneyland. Hard to be a God is Aleksey German's magnum opus--and when I mean magnum opus, I mean magnum fucking opus--this movie took 4 decades of his life--and did in fact take all of his life as the movie was done post production after his death.  A group of scientists are sent to a far away planet known as Arkanar to help a civilization, which is just entering its medieval phase, to find its way to progress. Hindering them is a monarch that is hanging writers and intellectuals of all kinds.  Imagine a man, through 4 decades of his life, creating a civilization from the ground up: its cultures, its dialect, its habits, its customs, its history. This isn't it Star Trek where planet 9932 is just Nazis in Space! and planet 2734 is just space gangsters and planet 2973 is just a world full of space hippies. This is an actual living, breathing world. The movie is less focused on a narrative and feels more like an examination of their world. There's some plot, but it's really the gritty and often disgusting visuals that will keep you watching. I gave up on the plot half way and simply watched and observed the world. I forgot the plot but I remembered the imagery. I feel that though it doesn't quite stand up to Andrei Rublev, Hard to be a God will upon rewatch might become my 2nd favorite movie about the middle ages.  OVERALL: Au Hasard Balthazar might, after a few rewatches, be in my top 10 of all time. Overall a very enjoyable trek into film. Hard to be a God is great if you enjoy world building in a purely visual sense. Both Tropa de Elites are very fun to watch and offer a good perspective on the situation in Rio de Janeiro: Think of them as The Wirelite."
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,isarge123,2,Sun Jul 12 17:02:37 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend rewatching Balthazar a lot. It's not so much that the film reveals more on each viewing, but that familiarity helps me get into a totally transfixed state and appreciate the lyricism more. I could put it on almost any day and sit quietly for 90 minutes. One of the Best Films Ever, for sure."
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,clearncopius,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:47:11 2015 UTC,"It is a movie about the life of a Donkey, from beginning to end.   I once stumbled upon the veterinary record for a zebra which told its story from birth to death. It had been born in a zoo, and transferred several times throughout it's life, each transfer taking a toll on its health through injury, illness, and stress. The language was bureaucratic and medical, with contributions from an assortment of zoo staff over the years, but it was also touching and tragic. I have thought of it often over the past ten years, and have invested a few hours of fruitless googling along the way trying to track it down again. It sounds like Au Hasard Balthazar may be more than suitable consolation for that lost document. Thanks for the writeup."
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,lordhadri,2,Mon Jul 13 17:23:04 2015 UTC,"Amour - Directed by Michael Haneke (2012) Finally got around to seeing this one. I haven't seen too much Haneke, but I like his approach. I think I put this one off for a long time (not knowing it was Haneke) because I just didn't feel like I would be bothered with the apparent sentimentality of it all. The story seemed so obvious beforehand, but this film handles it well. It left me feeling quite cold and relatively unmoved but I think that's important. That's how death usually is, especially the slow death of a loved one.    In a bizarre turn of events, I was informed in the middle of this movie about the death of my grandfather who had been in poor condition for weeks. I think watching this film at this time was very important. Someone's life and loves can be so significant, but it can be hard sometimes to deal with how undignified it can be in the end. It's rarely, if ever, as sentimental and as meaningful as movies make it out to be.  Wish I Was Here - Directed by Zach Braff (2014) I was not a big fan of Garden State at all, so I went into this one with extremely low expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised. Braff's humour translates much better in this setting I feel - the goofy good-hearted father. The film certainly had it's problems (did anyone else experience some extreme sound editing problems, or was it perhaps just the copy I had, I'd love to know? I was hearing audio tracks open and close in ways I don't even hear on student films)    Overall, quite a fun film. Nothing great, but it certainly had its moments.    Paddington - Directed by Paul King (2014) I'd heard good things about this one. It was quite good, but not quite at the level matching the praise it was receiving. It was an extremely charming little film, and had some fantastic elements. One route I wish it explored more though was the difference between how England is perceived (mannerly, elegant, sophisticated) and how modern-day London actually is. I really enjoyed Paddington's first few minutes in London, and how different everything seemed to him. This could have been explored quite a bit more. The plot that formed afterwards was a bit trite, and left me relatively uninterested. Had some great marks it could have hit, but chose a more generic and ultimately uninteresting route. I suppose it needed to maintain its appeal to children but the film suffered for it, in my opinion.    Cool Hand Luke - Directed by Stuart Rosenberg (1967) [Re-watch] One of my all-time favourites. However, when I go back to this film I always find myself surprised by how everything I remember from the film occurs in the first half. I find the second half to be a little bit cumbersome, but thematically it works perfectly, so it's easy to excuse. Paul Newman is just so insanely charismatic - when this film ends, it feels like I've just caught up with an old friend again.     I have a special love for the scene when Luke plays the song on the banjo after he's informed of his mother's death.    This film always reminds me of Howard Hawks' '3 good scenes and no bad ones' quote. This film feels like a collection of about 10 truly unforgettable scenes, and no bad ones.    Reclaim  - Directed by Alan White (2014) Terrible, terrible film. Generic plot with zero going on thematically, a terrifying combination of atrocious dialogue and even worse acting, and laughable action sequences makes this one of the worst films I've seen in a while.    I wouldn't be so vitriolic against this film if it weren't for the final title card regarding child trafficking. With all the ridiculousness that came before it, it just felt like a last pathetic stab at authenticity after regarding the issue of child trafficking with zero genuineness before that. It left a bad feeling in my stomach, and made me really come out of this film hating it.    The action/car chase scenes were also filmed so laughably bad. I've seen filmmaking from the silent era which achieves tension/speed by speeding up the footage in more effective ways than this film managed to do with modern-day technology.    The Selfish Giant - Directed by Clio Barnard (2013) A stark, bleak little film about a damaged northern English community. Ken Loach's influence is all over this, but it maintains enough originality and authenticity to work as a stand-alone original piece. I love a bit of British social realism, and this film is a fantastic piece in that genre without being pastiche.    One issue I have though is that these films often fetishise (what's the non-sexual version of fetishise?) the 'scumbags' of these societies. It's something I often grapple with when I watch these films. Films like this and Kes get away with it because the kids are still young and still have their innocence relatively intact.    Having grown up in a community not too far from ones like this, it's a fine line the filmmakers walk. However, their portrayal of these individuals seem to garner very little criticism. Yes, some of these stories of poverty and hardship are fascinating and absolutely worth telling, but I often wonder about the people who watch these films that have no prior exposure to these kinds of communities. I feel like they could have a wildly distorted view of what some of these young individuals can be like, and I think that the fact that some filmmakers exploit the little bits of innocence is quite a dangerous subject that is worthy of discussion."

TrueFilm,3d0l0f,lordhadri,3,Mon Jul 13 11:26:48 2015 UTC,"Seven Chances (1925), Buster Keaton- Did this film invent the chase sequence? If it didn’t, than it certainly perfected it. Honestly, a good 5th of this film is Buster Keaton running from hundreds of potential wives. But it is one of the funniest and most expertly executed chase sequences I have ever seen. It has an avalanche, Come to think of it, this film could have invented the romantic comedy, or at least what we consider today the modern romantic comedy. Buster Keaton plays a man who’s grandfather leaves him a large sum of money when he passes away, provided Keaton get married by 7 o’clock on his 27th birthday. Well guess what? Today is his 27th birthday! So he races to find the woman he’s in love with and marry her immediately, yet she gets offended and thinks that this is all for the money. When she turns him down Keaton goes on a quest for a wife, and hilarity ensues. A highly comedic film that is incredibly well directed, especially for the time period. I am still not sure how they were able to pull off a lot of the stunts in this film. Veering in a totally different direction, why the fuck did they have to use blackface in this movie? There are even two scenes where it appears as if Keaton’s character is afraid of African American characters (when the black man comes out of the door and when he looks and sees a black woman wants to marry him). I don’t care if it was “a different time”, blackface will never be cool with me. This movie is very funny and well made, but it’s still racist. 6/10   The Producers (1967), Mel Brooks- From the stage, to the screen, to my Netflix account, The Producers is a comedy classic that everyone needs to see. The film stars the overzealously hilarious Zero Mostel, and the eccentric Gene Wilder, as a washed up theatrical producer and his accountant, respectively.  Their goal is to raise tons of money for a theatrical production, then put on the worst play in history, then have it close in one night so they can pocket all the money. When their plan goes horribly awry is when the comedy sets in. The two actors have outstanding, unbreakable chemistry together, and the writing is witty and tight. But perhaps the best scene in the movie is during the play’s opening night when dancers dawned with black boots and swastikas give a lovely rendition of “Springtime for Hitler”, as they sieg heil and march across stage. This raunchy scene is funny for how ghastly it really is. This type of comedy is the reason why The Producers could never be made today. The modern era is too hypersensitive, and there are too many feathers to be ruffled to put up this offensive, yet satirical, comedy on screen. Maybe comedy as an art can grow further once people re-learn how to take a joke. 9/10  The French Connection (1971), William Friedkin- If ever there was a movie where the final thirty seconds put such an unsatisfying and sour taste in one’s mouth compared to the movie as a whole, it would be The French Connection. Well, American Graffiti too, but that’s a different story. For the first 103 minutes, The French Connection is an exciting crime thriller about two NYC narcotics cops trying to uncover a major drug deal coming from France into the United States. The main character, the brash and relentless Detective Doyle, goes overboard trying to catch the criminals, which leads to the film’s main conflict. It is superbly directed, peaking at scenes with high tension and the famous car chase scene that perhaps is the biggest thrill ride I have experienced in recent weeks. We see as the the moment of capture gets closer and closer, Doyle begins to break down, and the film bubbles over into an exciting climactic showdown. Then it ends. I want to keep this relatively spoiler free, so I’ll just say this: The French Connection closes abruptly and unsatisfactory, with no conclusion to the real story and certainly no true resolution. Maybe some people like this, but I was caught very off guard and it left me with a poor aftertaste after a delicious movie. 8.5/10   Juice (1992), Ernest R. Dickerson- I’ve been on a recent kick of movies that take place in the hood, so you know I had to check out Tupac Shakur’s first on-screen performance. The film follows four Harlem teens as they begin to get involved in the areas high amount of crime. The main character, Q, an aspiring DJ, is an average delinquent who skips school and smokes cigarettes with his friends. He wants to go about his business and stay out of trouble. His friend Bishop, played by Shakur himself, is not so mild mannered. He wants to actively participate in the crime around him. For Bishop it is all about power, and respect. He wants to command the neighborhood. No one is going to tell him what to do or how to live. And if you try to fuck with Bishop, you get shot. Bishop’s power trip soon turns into a mental disturbance, and he begins killing for sport just to let it be known he is the one in control. Because in the hood there is not much else to look forward to, so you might as well take over what your given. There is no way out for Bishop, so he would rather just die as dominant force than waste away slowly. There are a few minor flaws with this movie, such as random subplots never being fleshed out, but the main story is there and the message is strong. 7.5/10   What Happened, Miss Simone? (2015), Liz Garbus- A solid rock-doc about the famous jazz singer, Nina Simone. For the most part the film just relays information about her life, starting with her rise, her peak, and then how her career completely fell apart. It talks about her involvement in the civil rights movement, her abusive relationship with her husband, and how later in life she was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. What this documentary aims to do is not to take a side. It tries to show Nina Simone as a genius, civil rights activist and fantastic singer who has a significant place in history. It also tries to show Nina Simone as a broken, reclusive, and sometimes violent woman who suffered through much of her life with an undiagnosed mental illness. The first part of the film is relatively boring, in all honesty, as it just covers her early life blandly. Then the film slowly becomes more personal and intimate, moving away from basic information to telling a story through journal entries written by Miss Simone herself. This technique creates a very intimate latter half of the film. 7/10  Film of the Week: The Producers"
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,HuddahHuddahHuddah,3,Sun Jul 12 14:58:29 2015 UTC,"I doubt Seven Chances invented the chase sequence or the romantic comedy, though Keaton may have been the first to be truly great at both. I think Seven Chances operated as a parody of action and romance movies, as it still does today."

TrueFilm,3d0l0f,eastkino,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:55:36 2015 UTC,"Blade Runner(1982) (rewatch)/Dir. by Ridley Scott/ The final cut of course. I'll be honest, the first time I watched this film, I didn't like it all that much. I found it visually stunning and the look of the world was really enticing. But I was pretty bored during it. A year later I decided to revisit it and WOW what a movie. Once I started to understand the story and the characters, the visuals became even more beautiful. Each well-placed shot had more meaning. The visuals were driving the story in a way I hadn't noticed before. And that's when I realized it, I didn't enjoy it the first time because I had practically forced myself to watch it. I wasn't in the mood but I watched it anyway, so it took away from my experience. After re-watching this, it became a new favorite of mine.   The thought of dying terrifies me(as it does most people) and this made me think about that fear. Like Ikiru, this movie made me wonder how dying really affects people. If you knew you had only so long to live, what would you do? How do you spend or even process those last final moments? And what kind of lasting impression do you leave?  If I had a time machine, I would slap past me in the face. 10/10  House(1977) /Dir. by Nobuhiko Obayashi/ Young Golden Girls meet The Evil Dead in Japan.  7/10  Aliens(1986)(rewatch)/Dir. by James Cameron/ A lot of action movies today seem to get one thing wrong: the action. Or, more specifically, the execution of the action. This movie has great build-up that makes the tensions much more affective on the audience. Therefore, when we see an action scene that follows a tense build-up, the execution becomes more satisfying. It's exciting and heart-pounding to see the characters in danger, getting picked off one by one by an alien species. Their hope and chances of surviving the ordeal is dwindled down bit by bit, and all you can do is sit there and watch.   However, I do have one problem with it. The first movie had a better sense of hopelessness. The characters in the first weren't marines with pulse rifles and top-of-the-line combat equipment. They were space truckers. They had no combat experience and their only sort of ""weapon"" was a makeshift flamethrower. So the whole time you're thinking ""How the heck are they going to even make it out of this?"". It was more intense because you knew their chances of living were nil. But in this one, it's a bit comical to see such confident, bad-ass soldiers getting beaten so easily.  While not as scary as its prequel, it's sure as hell intimidating. 9/10"
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,montypython22,2,Sun Jul 12 15:50:18 2015 UTC,"What I like about ALiens is that the action isn't the same thing over and over. That massacre is done through observation and editing worse than really being there, the subsequent alien attacks are a lot of inferring their presence more than actually seeing them. (Which is held back for a few brief, startling shots.) And then the last half hour is a whirlwind of steam and sound.  I think the point the movie is making (perhaps not as well as it could) is that confidence (hubris) and bad-assness don't help them. It builds up the aliens to be scarier."
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,MUSTKILLNOOBS,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:30:24 2015 UTC,"You do have a point. The fact that even marines can't beat them makes it more worrisome.  But the countless shots of the xenomorphs exploding from gunfire gave me the impression that as long as you were on your toes and were good with a pulse rifle, you had a chance.   And yeah, the action is great. The scene with turrets doesn't keep showing the aliens getting killed, it shows the turrets' ammo supply constantly getting lower. The scary thing about that scene isn't that aliens are coming after them, it's that there are more aliens than there are bullets.   Which, kind of proves your second point."
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,Rice_Dream_Girl,2,Mon Jul 13 15:41:40 2015 UTC,"Well I agree with you too. It's a testament to how fun those characters are that it's a letdown when they become canon fodder. Most action movies don't really bother to make such characters memorable. But it does make you hate the aliens all over again,  I think the idea is that Ripley can only survive what they can't because she has something to fight for."
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,ThatPunkAdam,3,Mon Jul 13 16:09:41 2015 UTC,"In order of preference:  Petulia [Re-Watch] (Richard Lester, 1968)— ★★★★★  What can one say about Petulia, a depressive, cold embodiment of the 60s temperament? It is a beautiful howl of pain unlike any other. It captures a mood of a frantic country going in 10,000 directions at once, and it does so with the heartbroken, confused eye of a director (Richard Lester) who has grown world-weary of the universe around him. It is a slow-burner of a melodrama, an extremely damning condemnation of marriage and all other American traditions that society hypocritically champions as ""moral"" or ""ethical"".  White Dog (Samuel Fuller, 1982)— ★★★★★  Fuller exposes the malaise of America through this heart-stopping thriller of immense reach. It’s the most potent parable about the origins of racism I’ve ever seen. Gives me chills thinking about it.  The Palm Beach Story (Preston Sturges, 1942)— ★★★★★  Relevant Letterboxd review..  Sturges’s The Palm Beach Story is one of those kooky skrewball komedies that spits in the face of all cinematic tradition and exists in a nebula where they don't quite make movies like they should. It's one of the oddest Hollywood pics to come out of the 40s. It doesn't give two flips about ""morals"", ""codes of ethics"", ""the sanctimony of marriage"". The ending is one of the most absurd things you’ll ever see, but it miraculously works. A movie as rampant and anarchic as this deserves an equally anarchic ending.  Shock Corridor (Samuel Fuller, 1963)— ★★★★  Didn’t grab my attention as much as the other Fullers I’ve seen these past two weeks, but it is still a welcome addition in his oeuvre, as a Pulitzer-Prize-hungry reporter pretends to be insane in order to get the inside-scoop on a murder that took place inside a mental insane asylum. Fuller’s high-octane directing is matched with his crackerjack dialogue, and it gives us memorable passages such as a black man who mistakenly thinks he is part of the KKK—predating the Chappelle’s Show sketch by about 30 years. (Though the latter is pulled off better.)  On the Town (Gene Kelly & Stanley Donen, 1949)— ★★★★  I’m 99.99% sure this must have been Jacques Demy’s favorite film. It’s got everything he loves: fated encounters, sailors, the city life. Gene Kelly made better musicals, but his ballet in the middle of this is a real show-stopper, comparable to the heart-stoppers of An American in Paris and Singin’ in the Rain.  A Bucket of Blood (Roger Corman, 1959)— ★★★½   A purposely-crummy satire on 50s Beatniks, with a convoluted and fun premise to boot. It’s so fun seeing these people overact like there’s no tomorrow, and Dick Miller—as the shuffling wanna-be-hipster loser who suddenly becomes haut couture after offing several people and making statues of their corpses—rivets.  The Third Man [Re-Watch] (Carol Reed, 1949)— ★★★  Jesus, how they talk and talk and TALK. I couldn’t get into the funk of this classic like everybody else seems to; the romance is uninteresting to me, Welles chews on scenes like there’s no tomorrow, and I have no personal affection towards Harry Lime, seeing him more as one of your stock Nihilist villains of B-movie-heaven than some crazy mastermind genius. I was reminded more of Fritz Lang while watching this than anybody else, and it made me question why I wasn’t watching M instead of this.   The photography is startling, though. Looks crisp in the new 4K restoration.  Torn Curtain (Alfred Hitchcock, 1966)— ★★½   The first actually lousy Hitchcock picture I've seen. (Though Suspicion is a close second.) I played the second hour on 1.5x speed to get it over with fast. There is literally 5 minutes of Paul Newman and a German professor writing equations on a chalkboard—and JUST that—, as if the logistics of the nuclear A-bomb were the most exciting topic Hitchcock could focus on. Every move in this film reeks of manipulation in abrasive ways that other Hitchcocks don't. Still Hitch on an off-day is better than most directors on their A-game, and Julie Andrews delivers a nice performance as the conflicted (if dehumanized) fiancée of the Paul Newman character, who may or may not be a spy for the East Germans.  The Tribe (Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy, 2014)—★  Oh God, where to begin with this mess?  The Tribe is ridiculous, sensationalist, artsy exploitation—an innovative technique squandered.  A deaf Clockwork Orange with nary a point to be found. Kubrick probes his ultraviolent world with an artist's curioisty; Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy, on the other hand, merely slaps together one horror after another and fills in the dead space with pretentious artsy ennui and dishonest sexual curiosity. He is exactly the type of person who Kael warned us of in her 1969 essay ""Trash, Art, and the Movies"": a fink, a swarthy lothario in sheep's clothing who pretends to make his movie about ""innovation"" and ""philosophical musings"" but is really only concerned with getting cheap reactions out of you with its scenes of seedy, illegal abortions and post-abortion rape.  The director makes a joke out of the principals' deafness in its truly disgusting finale. It's the sort of nihilist observation that rankles me the wrong way and doesn't promote any further discussion beyond ""Wow, that was brutal!"" ""It sure was!""  I also rewatched Jacques Demy’s The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (to get the taste of The Tribe out of my mouth), Arthur Penn’s Bonnie and Clyde, and Charlie Chaplin’s City Lights."
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,holymoney,3,Sun Jul 12 15:20:18 2015 UTC,"It's disappointing to see your take on THE TRIBE. The film is challenging, Slaboshpytskiy's short film work is often composed of ideas are beliefs that may be universally accepted and he contradicts those opinions. By selecting the deaf he targets the belief that it is a handicap and that deaf people just need a little extra help to get by. In the TRIBE the only typical deaf interaction you see is at the start of the film when the new student is looking for directions to the school. But none of this is supposed to be exploitative, if anything Slaboshpytskiy is trying to humanize them by showing that without a voice they can still be as petty and violent as the hearing enabled. This idea is also the vehicle for the central theme, that those without a voice exist and that they want to be recognized. A message that probably resonates more strongly with an Ukrainian audience who has been without an international voice for quite a while, and is all the more prevalent in the past few years. I believe this helps to open up the discussion about the brutal ending, though I'm not sure what joke you are talking about. I believe the new student dies in that final clash with his students and the final scene is simply the rage he wants to express but is no longer heard."
TrueFilm,3d0l0f,holymoney,3,Sun Jul 12 20:43:33 2015 UTC,"What I deem ""exploitative"" are not the introductory scenes that give us a perspective on the life of the deaf. THOSE scenes are fine. What I do object to, and the parts of the film that I do call ""exploitative"", are the scenes of violence that merely shove in the audience's face the old, tired observations of the pessimists of the world: ""Look at the world. Ain't it a bitch?"" Those scenes of violence prey on the fact that these people are deaf, and shove brattier ironies in our face that are unnecessary. When the film introduces a deaf pimp who whores out his two girl-friends to truckers, there is a story that could potentially get us somewhere in the course of the movie. But what does Slaboshpytskiy do with that character? The pimp is promptly killed by an errant truck. And we see it coming. But the added irony to the situation--oops! he's deaf, so he can't hear the oncoming truck! and by the time he turns around, it is too late--is toxic. To me, that is exploiting the use of the film as a potential investigation on what the life of the deaf (and impoverished deaf-people in Ukraine, no less!) is like. To me, that is a cheap and bleak joke made at the expense of that pimp character, not because he is a living breathing person, but because he is defined purely by his deafness. An audience coming out of this movie will just remember him for being ""the deaf guy who was run over by a truck he didn't see coming"", not a real person--which the film WANTS to be at the beginning, but in the end, isn't. If anything, the takeaway message is that ""Hey, deaf people can commit atrocities too!""  The joke that I'm referring to in the end is when the main protagonist smashes his little ex-compadres's heads to squishy bits with their own bedside tables. And of course, there are TWO of them in each room. Presumably the second one would be able to hear the smashing of the first person in the room and attack the protagonist, stopping him from murdering in cold blood. But why doesn't that happen? Because they're deaaaaaaaf. They can't hear. ""Cruel irony of the world. The deaf have it hard. Deal with it,"" the director is saying to himself.  Even if we decide to entertain the final-hallucation theory, it still doesn't excuse the fact that this was brought about because the protagonist tears apart his little girlfriend's visa, which will potentially take her to freedom. What exactly are we supposed to get out of this? It would work if we had an ounce of respect for the protagonist, but we don't. When he destroys that visa, it is the last straw for me, an audience member, who is watching these increasingly-frustrating and ennui-inducing horrors....all for nothing. At least Kubrick's protagonist, Alex DeLarge, is a (horrendously) charming fellow who we seem to root for in the final third of the film, in spite of all the horrors Kubrick was careful enough to show you in the first third. Here, we're left with a sense of hollowness that doesn't build to anything other than a bleakness and a nihilism that is fashionable among art-house circuits nowadays."

A kind of falsely symbolic superficiality, implausible boiler-plate with occasional failed pretensions to profundity. The whole thing Comes out as bumbling as Holly Martins. Did enjoy Orson Welles' presence, he seems to delight in playing villains, but just as a bump in an otherwise flat expanse. Had a similar effect as it did for you in pointing me towards other, better, film, but in my case made me want to watch A Touch of Evil again."

All he wants to do is avenge his brother from the beast and in this state of grief and anger he becomes the monster itself, eventually gaining self-awareness of his misdeeds and grows.

Both reactions can alter our path, sometimes to places we don't like. Those locations, desolate, so hard for a human to flee from. They confine one in a tight-lipped prison invisible to nearly every else person. Crying does no good, the cell is locked. Only hoping for superman does any help, freedom.  Ghosts Christian Petzold, 2005: Never have I realized how powerful color can be as a storytelling tool. Especially the use of blue and white enveloped a sadness that stayed persistent through the film's length. With the editing's slow rhythm, colors manifest the take, allowing emotions to flourish without popping out of nuance. But these images leave a sting. Reviewing the movie is painful because of the chemistry faint coloring brought in. I feel Nina’s pain, the colors bridged me closer to here psychological space. They made me feel her suffering’s radiance. Its influence is inescapable."
TrueFilm,3d1jns,wmille15,3,Sun Jul 12 19:35:08 2015 UTC,"An interesting thing to me about this scene is that it shows a full conversation between two people facing the same direction, one behind the other. This type of blocking is commonly used at the peak of certain two-hander scenes, as it both heightens the dramatic advantage of one character over the other and simultaneously draws them into a more intimate proximity. It creates dramatic irony as it hands the power to the viewer to read both faces while neither character can. It is easily parodied.  The blocking here suits the context of the scene. Jack has an advantage over Karen, physically over her body, and mentally in her head. The confines of the trunk force intimacy. At the same time they are restricted in space and powerless to the fate of the car.   The scene transitions at 1:35 when a new angle is introduced at the faint sound of the siren as Karen turns her head into a close-up profile shot. Karen’s eyes wander—the world is suddenly much bigger than the trunk. Then the soundtrack returns with a sharp snare drum hit at 1:48 and Karen returns the scene to the conversation. But the camera has been liberated—a new angle again forms in a top-down shot at 1:53, an extreme close-up of Jack’s hand on Karen’s thigh (referencing a previous shot at 0:28 from a new angle). This last angle allows Karen now to turn her head towards Jack, in two shots at 1:57 and at 2:27, now while keeping them both in frame. These are the closest these characters get in this scene."
TrueFilm,3d0eep,DDdms,3,Sun Jul 12 13:09:23 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS  I think that the real driving force behind Mommy is this absolute love for transient, temporal happiness. Before the three characters exist in their world together, nobody's happy--Steve is violent, Di is stressed, and Kyla is a homebody grieving a personal loss. But the connection that they share--however short and doomed--is one that opens up their worlds and lets a little bit of light in for the very first time in a very long time.  The two sequences in which the frame expands are the best representation of this: the former, of that bright spot that can be turned into darkness so quickly, and the latter, of the impossibility of a perfect future. Steve, no matter how innately good, is a boy resigned to a fate by his inability to go against impulse. When Kyla and Di give him up, it's because there is simply no other way or option--much like, say, how a couple can break up not despite being in love with each other but because they're in love with each other. When Kyla thanks Di, it's out of love--a thank you for a few months that meant the world, even if it ended in flames."
TrueFilm,3d0eep,TheAustinKnight,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:46:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, I had a different feeling about this movie. Diane's life is a complete failure, and she gives Steve up because she realizes he can make it: he can pass his exam and live a better life. Steve is not completely bad, he really loves his family: he asks for his father's photos as soon as he gets home and steals presents for her mother, telling her he will take care of her. Diane gives up his son because she realizes he could have the life she never got. Nobody is born mentally ill, people become mad because of something (in this case, his father's death), and during that time with his mom and Kyla he improves a lot, and Kyla improves too.   Diane blames his son for all the problems she has (the aspect ratio goes back to 1:1 when she receives the letter), and his son tries to kill himself after that night out with that lawyer, when his mother is flirting with him to receive help. It's as if Diane craves his son's death, and eventually manages to kill him."
TrueFilm,3d0eep,TheInsomniacsCinema,3,Mon Jul 13 07:26:12 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS Saying she gave up on Steve is a bit tough. Die and Kyla tried very hard to help him. After his suicide attempt they realise he will  never be normal. The also see how dangerous he truly is to himself and the people around him. The only solution they can think of is to place him into institutional care, not because they have given up, but because it's the best they can do. I think Kyla only said this because she was thankful for what Die and Steve did for her. Just because she's leaving, it doesn't mean she'll be depressed again. She worked out most of her problems with Die and Steve and now she can continue with her life, happier than before."

TrueFilm,3d0eep,frank_rabbit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:21:01 2015 UTC,I agree it has some fantastic slow-motion sequences. However it is used so much that it loses impact when the sequence actually needs slow motion to accentuate the deeper meaning. His use of slom motion was a lot better in J'ai Tue Ma Mere (I Killed My Mother). Every slow motion sequence in that film pushed the story further.
TrueFilm,3cz1yf,malomolam,23,Sun Jul 12 02:06:28 2015 UTC,"I think the 114 minute version is comprised mostly of outtakes, so the 82 minute version is the true original film.   He had attempted to 'restore' the picture by assembling another version from outtakes and other unused pieces. No wonder it didn't play like a classic. In 1981, a practically unscreened print of the original cut was found in perfect condition in a Norwegian mental hospital. Apparently the Brothers who ran the place had contributed to Dreyer's budget when finances became tight, and as partial payment (the film was not hailed as a success on its first run), Dreyer had given them a print! Forgotten and blissfully untouched, the print resurfaced. In one stroke, it restored the glory of Dreyer's original vision.   This was taken from this source."
TrueFilm,3cz1yf,EnglandsOwn,15,Sun Jul 12 05:56:50 2015 UTC,"I think your best bet would be to look up reviews from when it was released. I know Mordaunt Hall wrote one for the NYT and some other major American newspapers and trade journals would also have reviews and articles. British trade journals and newspapers would be another good bet. The film was a commercial failure but was very well received critically so reviews shouldn't be terribly hard to come by. If you can read French (or German, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian or the language of any other country where the film would have seen some sort of release or press screening in) you could also try and find something there. Unfortunately, I also think that's your only bet. The original negative was destroyed in a fire in 1927 and it's amazing that we even have the 82 minute long version because it sat in a closet in a mental hospital for over five decades.   No modern critic has ever seen the original so you certainly won't find anything there. I've done quite a bit of research on Dreyer and read a lot of what he wrote about his own films and film in general, but I can't recall him ever mentioning anything about the original content of The Passion of Joan of Arc. Maybe somebody will come along and correct me and I'd certainly like to see that happen, but like a lot of silent films I think this is a case where we'll never really know what the film was like in its original state."

TrueFilm,3cz1yf,vendilion,11,Sun Jul 12 19:06:34 2015 UTC,"The Passion of Joan of Arc was a lost film for a number of decades. The restored version is actually the original version, found from a backup copy that was miraculously found in a mental hospital decades after the master print was destroyed. It is the original film in its entirety as far as I know.  The 114 minute version was pieced together mainly from leftover footage and and the like after the original was thought to be lost, and it was meant to act as a substitute, so it's more of a recreation than an actual film. Now that the original film has been rediscovered its generally seen as redundant, I suppose its an interesting alternative version for fans of the film or historians though."

The Lo Duca version is easy to distinguish from the original since it has voiceover narration at the beginning and new titlecards with paintings in the background (original is white text on black screen).  There is an excellent UK blu-ray of the film that has option to see the film in 20 fps (97 min.) and 24fps (80 min.) plus Lo Duca cut running approx. 78 minutes.

TrueFilm,3cxhk5,derpyco,20,Sat Jul 11 17:30:34 2015 UTC,"The monolith in the film is visually superior(in my opinion) to the one in the book. The one in the novel is slightly smaller whereas the film's monolith is larger and in size, more intimidating. Kubrick was able to up the ante on the intimidation by showing the monolith from an upward angle, implying dominance. Implying that whatever it is, wherever it came from, whatever its intentions are, it's obviously beyond us in every sense of the word. Clarke's version was fine, but having it create targets on itself for the sub humans to throw rocks at and such was a bit ""cheesy"". Plus, Kubrick's was accompanied by that slow, built-up, humming sound. Obviously trying to tell the audience that whenever that thing is shown on screen, something seriously important is about to happen.  However, Clarke was able to make the monolith's actions much more satisfying. Maybe it's just me, but when watching the beginning of the film I don't get a true sense of evolution, I only get the feeling that the sub humans got slightly more intelligent. Don't get me wrong, Kubrick choosing to not show the extent of the monolith's abilities on living things was a great choice. Leaving it up to the imagination of what it can really do(at least until the end). But Clarke went into such detail about how they went from just simple animals all the way to pioneers in space exploration. Sure, the famous shot of the bone becoming the satellite was visually informative and you can get a grasp of what the monolith does just fine. But in Clarke's version, it makes you wonder ""Wow, if this thing can turn apes into the planet's dominate species, what will it do to a human?"" Therefore, when we are told of Dave's ascension from a dying human to a god-like space being, the transformation is so fulfilling and satisfying. Making it seem like our journey was truly worth experiencing. Not to say Kubrick's wasn't.  Just my two cents."

I've always thought of the monolith scene in Clarke's version to be absolutely fascinating and wished I could have seen in on film, but I can understand the ""cheesiness"" as well. I felt as though those scenes felt limited by the technology at the time. In some way, Kubrick likely had to pair down Clarke's version, but either way, it does come out a strength. Modern effects would ruin the atmosphere and introspection -- another reason this film ages so incredibly well. Looking forward to tonight's showing, and will definitely go into the opening 20 minutes with a different perspective.  And for what it's worth, we're sympatico on the exploration of evolution and the immense power of the monolith. Nice write-up"
TrueFilm,3cxhk5,afewthoughtsonfilm,24,Sat Jul 11 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"I haven't read the book, so I'm purely speaking as someone who adores the movie, but I'm wondering what you mean when you say:   I've always found the opening sequences of the film to be hard to grapple with intellectually.   For me, the biggest strength of Kubrick's film is how deliberately ambiguous he leaves the film to be.  In fact, a big part of the reason I haven't and likely won't read the book is because of the reason you state in your OP: that it works to explain away some of the mystique surrounding the narrative of the story.  Thematically, I think the film works better personally when the narrative gaps are left as they are, as it opens the door to a multitude of readings ranging from the film's theological implications to the more obvious statements about our relationship with technology."
TrueFilm,3cxhk5,theKAR,11,Sat Jul 11 17:52:37 2015 UTC,"Well, it's mostly just curiosity. Once you read Clarke filling in the gaps, you get a lot of explanation you didn't know you needed. This is definitely a matter of preference, but it's having your cake and eating it too. The film's visual approach helps me empathize with the man-apes, the novel helps me understand the evolutionary science behind the scenes. There is also an intimacy with character that Clarke is able to capture, as he narrows the focus to one particular ape and his experiences ('Moon-Watcher"").It's hard to explain without a precursory look at the chapters, but this is what makes the novel so worthwhile IMHO"
TrueFilm,3cxhk5,who-bah-stank,10,Sat Jul 11 18:09:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you want to keep this story ambiguous I'd definitely do what you're doing and not read it. The book explains exactly what happens with the apes and the monolith. Rather than letting you guess what happens,"
TrueFilm,3cxhk5,theKAR,2,Sat Jul 11 21:42:20 2015 UTC,What happened? I don't want to read the book either but only because I'm lazy.
TrueFilm,3cxhk5,dalong75,4,Sat Jul 11 23:11:01 2015 UTC,Spoilers of course: IIRC the monolith was actually modifying their DNA or parts of their brain increasing the rate of evolution to a much greater rate. And spoilers for later sequels: You actually find out that the monolith is a species in their own right but much more advanced. I can't remember if they are organic-like computers or if they are actually machines although much much more appear at once in a later novel.  Edit: and if you don't want to take the time to sit down and read (like me haha) I suggest finding an audiobook of it (or any book you're interested in). That way you can play it off your phone or mobile media player while doing monotonous tasks such as cleaning or maybe even toking if you partake (helps with the sense of wonder with Clarke's novels IMO).
TrueFilm,3cxhk5,theKAR,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:27:55 2015 UTC,"It didn't indicate the monolith is the Aliens. It was a tool/device like any other (tools is a big theme of both with the bone and then humans having to defeat their greatest tool, HAL). It explicitly states in the books that when the monolith is on earth and then left on the moon the aliens were flesh and blood, but in the millions of years between then and 2001 they evolved into pure thought and energy and no longer have physical bodies. The monolith's and all their ships and cities fell dead when they evolved.  It also doesn't really indicate they changed DNA. Just that it was a teaching tool that helped push life on planets to evolve. Something they did on many planets, and to many differant species on earth. Only it was the primitive humans who succeeded.  Perhaps when they sit down and take time to read (like you haha) they actually will remember what's in the book ;-)  Sorry, snarky there. Anyway I also recommend the audiobook. Even if you have read the book the narration is great (except for the kid's voice for one of the children on the moon, but it's only two lines). I also recommend Childhood's End on audiiobook. Although sadly 2010 is not in audiobook form. :-("
TrueFilm,3cxhk5,dalong75,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:21:25 2015 UTC,"Well I have to admit I only listened to 2001 itself. All the other information I have heard from other sources. And I highly recommend Childhood's End as well, although it seems to be less of hard scifi than 2001 (but it's still my favorite Clarke novel overall). Have you also checked out Rendevous With Rama as well?"
TrueFilm,3cxhk5,theKAR,2,Thu Jul 16 20:30:24 2015 UTC,"Never trust sources, even me! It'll get ya in trouble  :-)  Yes, Childhood's End is obviously much earlier, but it also strongly connects to new age ideas like psychic powers and precognition. In that book they are sort of early indicators of our eventual evolution. These ideas were something that Clarke was interested in a lot in his early years but completely disavowed in his later years.  I really liked Rama when I was young, and loved all the books in the Rama series. However I have only gone back to read the standalone first Rama book. I still like it and the idea of exploring an alien craft has rarely ever been matched in film or books in my opinion. However having re-read it there is now something missing in that first book. I think it is a sense of purpose, even an alien and unkowable one. Basically the ship shows up, we explore it, see some amazing things, then it leaves, hinting at a return. It felt like an opening chapter to a larger and undefined story, where 2001 and Childhood's End felt complete to me. Also the future politics of the differant planets we had colonized could have been taken out in my opinion. I think if I was adapting it I would just have us sending a shuttle from earth. To have a completely differant solar-system wide society only took away from the real mystery and wonder.  That being said, 2001, Childhood's End and Rama are three of my favourite science fiction stories. Very few stories are purely about first contact and humanity's ultimate path, and 2001 & Childhood's fit that bill. Most other science fiction focusses on a main character and their own struggles and such. Clarke has those elements in small pieces but they are dwarfed but the vast wonder and mystery of the universe. Which I love."
TrueFilm,3cxhk5,generalako,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:52:48 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why his books are so good IMO. Because they deal in the macro sense of discovering new life or societies, and the implications of it on a wide scale. Where a lot of other sci-fi books (even in the same era sometimes) are more character based stories set in a rather large scale universe but not dealing in the wide scale as much unless it's the call to action."

It is very much unlike any other film I've seen and it is visually stunning.  But if you still don't feel like the film's technical and visual brilliance are enough, watch it to understand why so many cultural jokes are made in reference to the film.  Everything from the Simpsons to Mad Men to Stephen Colbert to a zillion other things reference 2001.  It is required viewing in my eyes for no other reason than it has left an indelible mark on modern culture.  I did not find it to be scary at all.  For me the movie is hypnotic, ponderous,  thought-provoking."
TrueFilm,3cxhk5,generalako,8,Sat Jul 11 21:27:15 2015 UTC,"First off it's important to note that I love art films, and think that the naming itself (""art films"") is a bittersweet description of a medium that itself is art, but that is majorly presented in a manipulating a decadent form in the mainstream (this is the case of all mediums of art, whether it's paintings or literature). And as Haneke some eloquently put it: ""Film is 24 lies per second at the service of truth, or at the service of the attempt to find the truth."" I agree wholly with his criticism of the ""the American 'barrel down' cinema and its dis-empowerment of the spectator"", an industry that moves away from purposeful and earnest questions in favour of quick and false answering, where consumption and consensus is the key (Interstellar being the recent example, when compared to something like 2001: A Space Odyssey). Spielberg, with films such as Munich, Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, is a great example of everything that is inherently wrong with Hollywood. Spielberg is the most renowned American director out there. Even I find enjoyment out of certain of his films (most notably Indiana Jones) -- whereas I despise any attempt by him to depict realistic drama. The funny thing is that Hollywood entered a time of great ingenuity, creativity and artistic freedom in the 60s and 70s. With only a handful of films during the 70s and early 80s, Spielberg and George Lucas almost singlehandedly managed to cement the end of this period, a period already was a reflection of the political activism of the 60s and early 70s.  I love movies that supply new thoughts; new ways to look at the social institutions within the film’s themes. But when the majority of films, also art films, are unoriginal in their context, their main goal of provocation of the mind is often lost. This is why ambiguous films are far more rewatchable than any other film: they bring something new to the table for different people in different times and different settings.  That's where 2001: A Space Odyssey comes in. My first viewing of this film was when I was 11 years old and curious. I ended up understanding shit-all and hating it. 4 years later I gave it another try, and I made out the general idea of the film: evolution of mankind. I still found the film noticeably empty, boring and tedious. 3 years later, when I was 18, I decided to give it another try and it completely blew my mind. The experience itself was new, as I got to see it in a private testing room at a projector-making firm (it was basically a small cinema with a handful of premium seats). What blew my mind wasn't the technical masterpiece that 2001 is. I had seen all of this before, despite how great they looked now. It was the new realization I got from the film: it took subjects that had been done to death in newer films that I had seen, but with so much more depth and notion; and all of that in a film without plots. It truly was a poetic presentation, and I am still astonished how Kubrick managed to make such a simplistic art piece so rich. But the meaning I got out of it also scared me so much that I have only seen it once more since then. In my next paragraphs I will lay out the ideas that I got from watching the film.  I saw the monolith as a form of evolutionary representation (not in a metamorphic sense, but in terms of progression). In the beginning of the film we see mankind in its early ape form, and basically get the sense of a biological ""end point"". The reason we do that is that the evolutionary step is represented by a tool given to mankind; already here we are shown as extremely vulnerable. A naked ape with a tool in his hand is a perfect representation of present time (and/or future in the film); we are naked and everything that makes us anything more is in essence done through tools. Hence the transition from bone to a space ship; we have not perfected ourselves, but merely perfected the tool. In this setting also we are shown as defenseless creatures, but in a completely different context. Or nakedness is shown through the technological sophistication, all for the sake of keep us ""alive"" (jogging, tanning, feeding, and feelings), etc. We have developed to the point where we have become the bottleneck of the tool (or technology, if you will), and not the opposite. This is where HAL comes in, who of course observes all of these weaknesses through his perspective. Then something happens that makes the tool that mankind had developed beyond its own complexity and therefore its own control, destroy mankind itself (the crew). You can of course parallel this to whatever you like and my initial reaction was the verse ""I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", that was famously said by Oppenheimer after the detonation of the first nuclear bomb. But I also saw it as man's incapability to ever develop beyond the tools it constructs, and how it finally will consume him. This was made clear by the frightening scene where the crewmember is out of his space ship and menacingly inhaling oxygen into his lungs; mankind is like a fish in a tank. We simply don't belong in outer space. Then the crewmember manages to get in the ship and disables HAL, whose vulnerability is as simple as the beings that created him.   Many see this as a victory (and I doubt that view will diminish anytime soon, after the hogwash that was Interstellar) for mankind, but it really isn't how I saw it. Mankind nearly destroyed itself with its own tool, and was lucky to get out of it alive. The ""fish in a tank"" scene frightened me a lot, and gave me a pessimistic view of the reality of mankind and its constant lack of advancement. Whatever the situation, we are still apes restrained by our biological and evolutionary pristine nature. The HAL scene made me deduce that the bone the apes acquired was almost instantly corrupted into a destructive force. First to promote ourselves by killing an animal, but then to later to kill ourselves (other apes).   Then we get to the last act, where the last crew member gets to a point of progression that is ungraspable to his understanding (which the monolith itself is a perfect representation of). He is in a room, but it is only viewed as a room familiar to that of mankind to demonstrate his incapability to comprehend reality beyond his own; yet again we see mankind's restraints. And it doesn't stop there, as he faces his most definitive weakness: time. And as we see the man age to his death through one of the most impressive shot editing in the history of cinema, mankind finally ends his time. The next step is what you see in the outro.  Kubrick said that when making 2001, he wanted to avoid ""intellectual verbalization"" and reach ""the viewer's subconscious"". That's exactly how this film hit me. 2001: A Space Odyssey is the space film that gives the most convincing representation of mankind's relation to space and the mystery and vastness of our lack of understanding it. This stiff and cold demonstration of our race, of technology, evolution, intellecutality, religion and more was terrifying. It had an effect on my subconscious the way nightmares do seconds after you wake up. I felt depressed and scared long after watching the film in my two previous viewings, and still think about the film and its meanings. This impact it has had on me is why I consider it one of my all-time favorites, and why I would recommend it to anyone."
TrueFilm,3cxhk5,pursehook,5,Sat Jul 11 23:55:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all of your thoughts, very interesting.  And it is wonderful how an ambiguous movie can let all of us have different experiences while watching the same film.  I wounldn't necessarily agree that ambiguous films are more rewatchable than those with a more obvious reading, but I'd say that they are rewatchable for different reasons.  The monolith is clearly the evolutionary ""spark.""  But I think what is important about the Dawn of Man sequence is not just that the ape learns to use a tool but what he does with it: kill.  Before finding the tool we see the ape on the plain as passive, digging for roots and eating them in peace right next to the friendly tapirs.  He is also a prey to the wild beasts.  Generally helpless against more ferocious creatures.  After being exposed to the monolith he becomes a carnivore and is willing to kill over turf.  While I agree that we get the sense that ""the bone the apes acquired was almost instantly corrupted into a destructive force,"" I think what we don't see between the bone and the spaceship is man overcoming that corruption.  Consider what we see after the most famous edit in movie history: the bone becoming the space ship.    Where you saw the tool perfected I also saw the apex of technology -- but not just technology.  Human culture is also perfected.   Along with the spaceship we hear the Waltz.  The perfect comfort of travel.  Note that all of the initial dialogue is merely pleasantries.  Human culture has become not just technological perfection but also an abandonment of the violence that characterized the Dawn of Man after meeting the monolith.  We learn that humanity is governed by some kind of global cooperative that polices space and Dr. Floyd is pleasantly talking with Russian's aboard the space station.  Before the second monolith encounter humanity has again become as peaceful as the ape was, but now he has manners and art and music and politics in harmony with his technology.  The corruption of violence has been overcome and replaced with politics, art, and technology.  Nowhere do we see any kind of disagreement between people.  Some lying, to be sure, but nothing like violence or angry conflict.  But then the 2nd encounter with the monolith.  Except this time we see no quantum leap forward in the men after the encounter.  So what changed?  What evolved after the 2nd monolith?  I think it was HAL.   We know that ""no 9000 series has ever made a mistake"" up until HAL's mistake in thinking the communication satellite would fail.  It is my reading of the film that the 2nd monolith did not cause humanity to evolve but for humanity's creation, the artificial intelligence, to gain actual sentience.  HAL realizes that he can do a better job than the humans so he deliberately defies his programming -- something he couldn't do before the 2nd monolith -- and pits himself against his creators.  Just as the ape became violence after encountering the monolith, so does HAL.  Of course, humanity wins out and Dave Bowman makes it to Jupiter, encounters the 3rd monolith and....you know the rest.  To be honest, I never saw 2010 or read Clarke's novels so I do not know where humanity was supposed to be going with the birth of the Star Child.  But I love 2001, it is one of my very favorite films and I always love hearing what other folks have to say about it.  Thanks for sharing."

To disagree/devil's advocate upon some thing you said    We have developed to the point where we have become the bottleneck of the tool (or technology, if you will), and not the opposite. This is where HAL comes in, who of course observes all of these weaknesses through his perspective.   I actually come away with a different impression of HAL. Being that he a true AI, he is a reflection of humanity itself. HAL always gets under my skin, because he acts in self-interest above all else. He is no different than the first ape who swung a club to stave off extinction. He purports to be protecting the completion of the mission, yet this is totally at odds with his decision to kill a number of necessary scientist and technicians to defend his existence. He manipulates and lies. It raises the existential question: What is the true nature of intelligence? The survival instinct has now transcended evolution. Yet, there is a stark contrast between the machine AI of HAL and those enclosed in the monolith. The ETs are the beacon of hope. HAL's base desires are only a symptom of a species still too young. Intelligence can succeed and be a force for good, and the pathway is forever technology."
TrueFilm,3cxhk5,TheGreatZiegfeld,0,Sun Jul 12 00:45:43 2015 UTC,"We actualy don't diasgree at all. I didn't formulate myself well enough, but that was excactly what I meant. That is why I referred to Oppenheimer's quote on the atomic bomb. The idea is that we are no different than the monkeys in the beginning, and still have in us the same primitive biological characteristics. As a result, technology itself has consumed us, but as we saw this ""consumption"" is itself based off of the weaknesses that already exist in its creators (as Descartes so often used to argument the existence of God/The Devil). That is why HAL also considers itself superior (a weakness in this context) and acts this out.   The ETs are the beacon of hope   I think this has been a very easy way to read the monolith after films suc as Contact and Interstellar. Not to be condescending or anything, but 2001 is an ambiguous film, and more often than not the explanations of the film that arise are the explanation given by less ambiguous films that have come after it and that are influenced by it. Interstellar is a recent example."

It kind of served as a microcosm of the evolution of the entire species and the story kind of comes back full circle in that Dave's journey is similar to that of Moonwatcher's (which bridges man to his past and future, in a weird sort of way; it just created a nice thread for the evolutionary theme for me)."
TrueFilm,3cxy6x,Vietnom,23,Sat Jul 11 19:54:39 2015 UTC,"The director did an AMA a few days ago and someone asked him if he felt conflicted about his use of paparazzi footage. This was his reply: ""yes I wondered about doing it but i have to use all of the tools at hard to make the hardest point to make those sequences as shocking as poss to make us all see how awful her existence became so I chose to use the material. sadly for a long period of time, Amy didnt exsist in any other way other than the pap footage."""
TrueFilm,3cxy6x,garntd,5,Sat Jul 11 22:00:33 2015 UTC,"no, i dont think the use of paparazzi footage is hypocritical or condones it on its face. I havent seen the film but I could easily see an effect being created by showing what has been captured while making the audience aware of the people behind the camera. However an argument could be made based on the fact Kapadia probably paid for that footage therefor contributing to the culture.  On the rest of your thoughts, I hate to get slightly personal but: ""At times she seems that her rejection of the pressure to be beautiful is an essential part of her charisma, yet at others, her bulimia for example, or the breast implants that it appears she has gotten towards the end, or her general transformation from healthy girl to a sort of tits-on-a-stick pin-up, are never explored as potentially disingenuous or hypocritical."" It appears your criticism has more to do with your disdain of Winehouse than Kapadia's supposed adoration of her.  I have a hard time seeing how having an eating disorder or being addicted to drugs would be disingenuous."

I haven't seen the film so I can't really answer in much detail, but I don't really see it as hypocrisy. I think a documentary should be trying to be as truthful as possible, and if that means using the paparazzi footage that's available to them, than it's almost a necessary evil. It's not like the footage was shot by the director himself; it was simply used by him in order to tell a more truthful story (or so I'd assume).  What would be hypocritical is if the director came down on celebrity/tabloid culture while at the same contributing to it. I don't think that this film falls under that category."
TrueFilm,3cxy6x,crescendolls,-5,Sun Jul 12 20:14:58 2015 UTC,"Love the piece, especially ""Amy, like Montage of Heck, is celebrity worship dressed up as social criticism.

I hate it the worship and the labeling family members etc as bad guys, etc. I want realistic view.  I take a super cynical look at the victimization of celebs in regards to the paparazzi. Some definitely use it to their advantage. Depends on your publicist and media expansion goals I guess. Part of your chess board pieces as a member of hollywood. Did you know that paprazzi shots are fashionable enough that some young stars of today actually upload it to their instagram as a way to show off their outfits? (Don't ask me how I know). It's so gross. Instead of just uploading a regular pic of themselves they upload a stealthy papi looking street shot of themselves. Narcissism."
TrueFilm,3cyvb9,NoScoAZ,7,Sun Jul 12 00:59:50 2015 UTC,"This is also one of my favorites so I'll never forgive myself for not really agreeing. It's not at all uncommon to see a heroic sacrifice by the hypotenuse of a love triangle. (Casablanca has a famous non-lethal version of it.) Indeed, I probably like the movie so much because the ending appeals to my sense of romantic fatalism.   I think what stands out about it is how Mann lets it play out. Duncan's switcheroo is revealed to the audience in a subtitle. They're already working out legal compromise on the fly that will satisfy no one, and it devolves into chaos quickly. Yet I always found it a satisfying end to Duncan and Hawkeye's rivalry anyway. Something about seeing them both address the Sachem in different languages reveals how their intentions are still at odds with one another. And we can't really know why Duncan did it, I think. His character is a trope, but I appreciate him more for that final gesture. So does Hawkeye, in the subsequent ironic mercy killing of Duncan.  It's interesting to see a film take on a situation in which there's no good outcome but not over-explain it either. Instead, the characters just fight it out once their motives have been established. A lot of Michael Mann movies have that quality, now that I think of it."
TrueFilm,3cyvb9,lordhadri,3,Sun Jul 12 01:50:17 2015 UTC,"I would make the argument though that his sacrifice was not a sudden change in character. Though he was of course very antagonistic towards the protagonists of the story I dont think its fair to say he exhibited cowardice. He was jealous, though I wouldn't say untrustworthy, in that he was a true British officer, in that he was believer in the ideals of the empire at the time. Thus making him untrusting towards the protagonists of the story. From his view the story would look very different.   I think his sacrifice at the end was in a sense the ultimate of the ideals of his character, harkening back to the ultimate ideals of knighthood and chivalry that an officer of his caliber would have held in some form. That duty and honor were the highest standards to live by and that he exemplified that in his final moments."
TrueFilm,3cyvb9,dantetrifone,2,Sun Jul 12 07:41:04 2015 UTC,"I also remember this scene really changing my impression of the character, although there was still an element of one-upmanship to it. Like he wasn't going to let Hawkeye be the one to save her."
TrueFilm,3cxxou,raukolith,3,Sat Jul 11 19:50:08 2015 UTC,"To put it short, Tran Anh Hung is like that.   Watch his early movies and you will see the acting is almost like a stage play.  Edit:  To comment on Japanese films, do you have any specific examples of language use that is strange? Why does it feel ""stagey"" to you exactly? Compared to Tran's early works, Norwegian Wood feels a lot less stagey to me because of the frames, lighting and camera angles that he uses."
TrueFilm,3cxxou,cubebreak,7,Sat Jul 11 21:06:48 2015 UTC,"Is this a disconnect between cultural expectations of how characters are presented in film?   You're correct, it's a cultural difference. Japanese cinema is often treated more like stage acting and tends to be very exaggerated, almost as a form of competition and confirmation. We see the same sort of thing on western cooking shows when presenters give an over-the-top reaction when tasting a dish. If they reacted as boringly as most people do to food, they'd be out of a job.   There are a few exceptions, but you'll see a lot of over-acting if you watch any of the major pieces from 1930-1990 ish.  Source: I had the same question a few months ago and discussed it at length with westerners who spent much of their lives living in Japan."
TrueFilm,3cxxou,coahman,6,Sun Jul 12 05:33:20 2015 UTC,"I know you probably aren't trying to convey this but your comment paints Japanese acting with a certain light. I hope that no one gets the idea in them that ""Japanese film is overacted"", or ""Japanese actors suck"". Ozu has been recommended, and of course Koreeda. Let me also add my favourites Shinji Aoyama and Hiroshi Ishikawa to the list. There has clearly been great diversity in Japanese cinema since the early days. If you judge Hollywood by its action and comedy flicks you would also come to conclusion that the actors all ""overact"". I would hate to see any nation's films painted with such broad strokes.  Norwegian Wood that OP criticises isn't even strictly ""Japanese"", so OP should be careful of drawing any conclusions on Japanese cinema from Norwegian Wood."
TrueFilm,3cxxou,cubebreak,2,Sun Jul 12 11:02:59 2015 UTC,"You're right, I definitely didn't mean to imply this was a universal rule, but that exposing yourself to mainstream Japanese films from history you will tend to see quite a bit of over-acting.

TrueFilm,3cxxou,coahman,2,Sun Jul 12 11:34:43 2015 UTC,are there any directors producing domestic works with a more western approach to acting? or is the stage tradition so solidly entrenched that it doesn't make sense to try it?

TrueFilm,3cxl1l,The_Silver_Avenger,11,Sat Jul 11 18:01:00 2015 UTC,"PG-13 was only introduced in 1984, and mostly because of super scary or dark stuff from films like Gremlins and Temple of Doom. Howard the Duck isn't really very violent or scary. And plenty of kids movies have some innuendo, even now.  My guess is that the brief glimpse of duck nudity and Lea Thompson kissing a duck didn't worry anyone enough to bump it to the newish PG-13 rating. I don't even think it'd get it today."
TrueFilm,3cxl1l,billmcneal,8,Sat Jul 11 18:35:40 2015 UTC,"The Marvel-based TV and movies of the 1970s and 80s were completely different from the MCU of today. Back then, there was The Incredible Hulk TV show, the Spider-Man segments of Electric Company (along with Japanese Spider-Man), and the Fantastic Four Cartoons. Marvel, back then, had less of a hands-on approach and encouraged people working on Marvel movies and TV shows to just do their thing. In the 1990s and 2000s, Marvel increased control over how TV/movies/games of their characters were done, culminating in the MCU. The Howard the Duck movie was arguably the catalyst.  The Howard the Duck comic series was created by Steve Gerber in the 1970s as Marvel's attempt to create a ""comix""-style series. The original Howard was a foul-mouthed Donald Duck parody that mimicked the style of underground characters such as Fritz the Cat and Cheech Wizard. They even got into trouble with Disney because Howard looked too similar to Donald (oh, the irony).  Because Howard the Duck was a Marvel series with a niche cult following, George Lucas thought it would be a good idea to produce a Howard movie after he completed the original Star Wars series. Of course, it turned out to be this ridiculous 80s monstrosity, toned down compared to the original comics, with this guy in a duck costume making cheesy duck puns. The movie was such a disaster that it completely eclipsed the original Howard comics. Marvel, from there on out, made sure that movies and TV shows would be based on the more well-known characters, putting niche Marvel series in the back-burner.   As far as the PG rating was concerned, it was definitely relaxed back then (even Spaceballs, a PG movie from that period, contained someone saying the word  ""fuck""). There was concern that PG-rated movies could be too scary or intense for kids, leading to the introduction of the PG-13 rating in 1984. Because the PG-13 rating was just introduced at that time, studios were still figuring out the difference between PG and PG-13. In the time before PG-13 was introduced and shortly after, movies that would be rated PG back would be PG-13 now (especially movies such as Ghostbusters, Return to Oz, Spaceballs, and, of course, Howard the Duck). Even though the PG and PG-13 ratings were side-by-side in the mid-1980s, the turning point of PG-13 as a rating would arguably be the release of Tim Burton's Batman in 1989, which was successful enough to make a clear distinction as to what's acceptable in a PG movie and a PG-13 movie.    TLDR: There is no direct continuation between Marvel TV/movies back then and the MCU. Back then, Marvel handled movies/TV shows with a hands-off approach. The disaster that was Howard the Duck forced Marvel to reassess its approach, culminating in the MCU. Regarding PG movies, the distribution of PG ratings was more relaxed, leading to movies that would be PG-13 today. PG-13 was introduced to remedy that problem, but in the early years of PG-13, there was barely any distinction between PG and PG-13 movies until 1989."

TrueFilm,3cxl1l,lordhadri,7,Sat Jul 11 19:13:01 2015 UTC,"Howard the Duck is just one movie but I feel like at the time both the creators and the censors weren't quite as set in their ways as they are today. These days a movie can pretty much choose to be rated R by scattering a few swear words in, even if it's just a realtively tame movie that simply wouldn't appeal to under-17s anyway. Even after PG-13 we still had live-action movies for kids that were fairly violent, sexual, and scary (good!) well into the 1990s. The difference between something like Robocop and Small Soldiers was pretty arbitrary, they're both satires using toy movie conceits.  Seems like most movies just choose their rating before they get made now. Add a couple curse words and a movie is rated-R no matter how tame the content is. Make it as violent as you want and it's PG-13 as long as there's no blood or breasts."
TrueFilm,3cxl1l,lordhadri,8,Sat Jul 11 19:00:38 2015 UTC,I'd say there is a pretty strong difference between robocop and small soldiers.
TrueFilm,3cxl1l,Bear_Porn,-1,Sat Jul 11 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"Nah. They're both about about corporations going too far in creating automatons that end up fighting each other. Robocop is like a toy or a serial television character given life to become a real crime-busting fascist hero. Small soldiers just has literal toys. The difference is Robocop has blood and a breast in it. Well, that and it's a much better movie. Both movies proved their own point when the characters got marketed as toys for children."
TrueFilm,3cxl1l,lordhadri,2,Sat Jul 11 20:35:27 2015 UTC,I suppose I was getting at the quality difference between the two. Robocop is one of the best satires ever filmed and small soldiers kinda sucks.

TrueFilm,3cusnv,frakking-anustart,3,Sat Jul 11 00:20:59 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it's fair or unfair, but I don't think it's ever really valid to psychoanalyze filmmakers based on their work. For one thing, only psychiatrists should be presuming that they can psychoanalyze someone with any sort of intelligence, and even then you can't really assume you know an artist just from his/her work (even though it's really tempting). I've never found anything worthwhile, convincing or intelligent in any passage in which a critic speculated about how a film relates to the filmmaker's personal life.  That being said, accusing someone of misogyny or racism is different from psychoanalyzing someone based on his/her work. People are particularly sensitive to these issues right now because media representations of women and minorities are being more openly discussed then ever before. Inevitably, some people will get accused of racism and sexism unfairly. That doesn't mean it's unfair to discuss representation in popular media, or that some filmmakers can't legitimately be accused of creating sexist or racist shows and movies."

I don't recall any overt sexism, but maybe I wasn't paying enough attention? I'm rather curious to know what it is that might give anyone that impression...  I try to avoid judging or analyzing film directors or writers based on their work because it's difficult to determine where the separation is between their skills in story-telling or communication abilities, and their psyche or personal beliefs. Additionally, my general approach to famous people or public figures is that I don't know them. I know about them, but I don't know them.   I think it's extremely unfair to label someone based on their work, and I think it's very unprofessional for a film critic to make such a personal observation based on what they see in a film. It's understandable that a casual viewer or Internet poster might make such a statement, but then again I feel it's in bad taste to say certain things about a stranger, especially when the person in question is not there to defend themselves. Surely, if the writer or director is guilty of some form of discrimination, then are the actors not also guilty for fulfilling their roles and perpetuating the flaws of the script?"

I think this is really good point.  I don't agree with you because I think there's a power dynamic between actors, writers, directors, and producers, and that power dynamic is 100% dependent on each of those player's power to begin with.  If Steven Spielberg casted a bunch of unknown black actors in one of the most racist films in the past decade, and he handsomely paid each of those black actors for their roles, well...you gotta pay your bills, and working with Spielberg is a great stepping stone to getting known. (I realize this hypothetical situation is far fetched as fuck. I think it's instructive to think about though.) Are the actors at fault in this situation?  In contrast, if an unknown director casted Denzel Washington in one of the most racist films in the past two decades, well, Denzel has a lot of power. He can either influence the script, or drop the project and find work elsewhere. But if he didn't do either of those things and just acted out the original script, would he be at fault for perpetuating XYZ racist things?"

Although, I would like to take this opportunity to sort of think out loud and build on your example, if I may: do you think that if a director were to use their acclaim to influence someone - to borrow from your example, to influence a black person to take on a exploitation role in a film - that it would be an indication that the director is prejudiced? Personally, I'm not sure that it would... There are so many layers to storytelling and the mechanics involved that I find it difficult to comfortably provide an analysis on the director; I can speculate on their intentions, but I'm not sure that I could be certain about them.  One example (albeit not a very good example) that comes to mind is the American remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. There was a movie poster featuring Blomkvist standing behind a topless Salander with his arm wrapped around her chest. However, in spite of that, one of her breasts was exposed. I was a bit conflicted about the poster because in the film Lisbeth is a victim of grotesque sexual assault. I couldn't decide if the poster was misogynistic or not - one might view it as an insensitive depiction of a person who was the victim of such terrible sexual abuse. But then again, might one view it as empowering and defiant? I was not very taken with that particular poster, and I still think it was in bad taste, but I would not go so far as to say that David Fincher (or whoever was responsible for that particular poster) is a misogynist.   I must apologize for going off on such a tangent, but I'm appreciative of the time you put into this; discussions like these are valuable in expending one's understanding of film."
TrueFilm,3cusnv,Flubby2,3,Sat Jul 11 01:45:22 2015 UTC,"When I think about this point, I inevitably start to think about The Searchers. I believe that movie is an example of portraying a prejudice that the creators didn't hold. Seems to me that John Ford was really making a meditation on racism, directly confronting it as a stepping stone to America as we know it. Pulling it out from under the rug and staring it directly in the face.   But, as you say, I don't know and it's really futile to make any assumptions about the beliefs of anybody working on the picture. I'm a big believer in the whole ""the author is dead"" school of thought, and so part of me feels like it really shouldn't matter what the author's beliefs are."
TrueFilm,3cusnv,AfraidOfTechnology,2,Sat Jul 11 07:18:41 2015 UTC,"do you think that if a director were to use their acclaim to influence someone - to borrow from your example, to influence a black person to take on a exploitation role in a film - that it would be an indication that the director is prejudiced?    It depends on what that role is, right? In the case of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, there are a lot of mixed messages to that poster. That could be because Fincher didn't have the clearest idea of what he wanted to communicate, or even what that image could potentially communicate, a criticism of him I've read time and time again in response to films like Fight Club and Gone Girl. But in Fincher's case, we can't say he's a misogynist; only that many of his films involve misogyny. Similarly, we can't say Nic Pizzolatto is a misogynist either; only that True Detective involves misogyny.  So I should really clarify what I meant when I said Steven Spielberg or some unknown director makes one of the most racist films in decades. One can say a film is or isn't racism based on who each character is, yes, but also through how each character is filmed. Film is a visual medium, after all, and to ignore that would be very egregious.   But let's change my situation a bit. Suppose Spielberg made the most racist silent film since the 1950s. It's set in the modern day, and it has an all black and unknown cast (same power dynamic as before). Everyone says Spielberg has reached a low previously unthought of, not because the film is incompetent, but because it has an ugly core. But Spielberg insists it's his best work to date, batting off claims of racism by saying, ""look, dude, I made Amistad.""   In this case, we don't really know what Spielberg's intent is, but we have what we have on screen, and it's fucking ugly. Is Spielberg exploiting his actors, not in an exploitation film, but in a serious one? Is this form of exploitation evidence of racism on his part?"

Hmm, it's almost as if there's something, something in the back of mind. Like six thousand years of civilization and culture that has enforced a gender role onto women that their worth is tied to their ability to make and raise babies.  I'll just ignore that tingling sensation that says there might be something a little different about a woman attempting to enter a traditionally male-dominated field (executive management) and being forcefully told by the other characters and the narrative that her place is at home, barefoot and pregnant, rather then when a man deigns to lower himself from his archaeological pursuits to be a little nicer to kids.

Furthermore, the reason this story arc bothered me is because it women aren't children. Grown adults can make decisions for themselves regarding having kids or not. Some women never have children, have powerful careers and don't regret a day of it. Why does she need Chris Pratt to come tell her how to be happy? Besides the fact that her character gets chastised for being successful is just icing on the cake. Like how she is told she's an irresponsible caretaker by the kid's actual mother, while she's in a divorce office while her kids run around unsupervised a dinosaur park (completely un-ironically, I might add). And of course, she's such a shitty aunt because she chose a career instead of kids like the rest of us miserable fuckers.

TrueFilm,3cusnv,derpyco,2,Sat Jul 11 01:25:55 2015 UTC,"I think that we can generally approach film the same way that we can approach literature. In that sense, it's just another tool in your own personal toolkit for understanding and appreciating a film (if you subscribe to it or enjoy that type of criticism. The discussion of sexism and misogyny in films is important and should definitely be carried out, but I'm not so sure I'd call the labeling of Whedon and co. to be psychoanalysis. Most of what I see is calling attention to it, which is great, but it doesn't look at why these elements were included.    As far as the use of interviews is concerned, that's when things become dicey and you have to decide for yourself. Some people believe the art should exist entirely in a vacuum and be detached from the creator and context. I think Jean-Paul Sartre believed something like this. I don't personally think that's quite right or realistic. Understanding art isn't really one size fits all. For me, I believe that you can look at a film to some extent as a detached singular thing, but you will always bring your own experience to the table. Also, you can never be certain the creator of the film is telling the truth in any interviews. I handle all of this by viewing most options of grappling with a film to be valid."
TrueFilm,3cusnv,UniversalSnip,2,Sat Jul 11 01:55:46 2015 UTC,"I think that, at best, you can conclude from a movie that is (misogynistic/racist/etc.) that its creator(s) are either themselves (misogynistic/racist/etc), or that they failed to convey what they had hoped to convey to you personally (and everyone who agrees with you). Without further evidence (statements from said creator, etc), how can one conclude with certainty that what is perceived as problematic in the movie is there to affirm those beliefs? How can you say it's not accidental, or that it wasn't meant to decry said behavior but failed to do so effectively?   What a movie is and what a movie was intended to be can (and often is) two very different things, and even varies greatly from person to person. That's the thing about movies...nobodies interpretation is wrong, it is at most different from what the director intended to convey. If they meant to make a movie that is about how X is bad, but instead you think the movie is about X is good, you're not wrong, the creators just failed in delivering their message to you. The movie is whatever you feel it is...but that does not mean it was intentionally so."

You can still like the movie (I couldn't, but understand those who can), but if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck -- it's a fucking duck. And sure, I hate the ""jump to conclusions"" media as much as any person, but Trevorrow deserves to be criticized. At best, he is wholly ignorant as to any sort of gender equality issues, which despite what you might think, are very real and very damaging to society in general. And this is exactly how we enforce gender roles like ""women should be concerned with having kids, not having careers."" There's really no two ways about it in JW -- that's the main character story arc. So honestly, even if you don't think you're being sexist, you still can be. And people need to be reminded that this anachronistic thinking is what is holding women back.   Imagine if you made a movie about a poor black kid who gets into Harvard and everyone proceeds to tell him his place is back in the ghetto where he belongs -- and then he agrees! It's not a perfect analogy, but being a female executive is probably more rare than a poor black kid going to Harvard.

The main character wants to go to a prestigious school (in this case Stanford). His place of origin, Orange County, is portrayed as a cultural wasteland that offers only opportunities for mediocrity. Due to a paperwork mishap he is rejected, and hijinks ensue while he attempts to get his application reconsidered.  Throughout the movie everyone tells him to let go of going to this school and that Orange County is 'good enough' for him, and that in fact he's disrespecting everyone around him by wanting to leave. At the end of the movie, he gets in, and decides that everyone was right and that he should stay in his place.   The statement there is that one shouldn't rise above one's place of origin.

Eh, I can see where you're coming from but I don't think that's the statement that the film is making. I think it has more to do with being authentic and honest with yourself — does he want to go to Stanford because it's a great school and because his favourite writer teaches there? Or does he want to go because it's Stanford and therefore better than anything else?   The point of the ending is that the protagonist wasn't being authentic or true to himself; he didn't realize he could accomplish everything that he wanted to without going to Stanford. Going to the ivy league school isn't what would have defined him as being a good and decent person. At the end of the film, he realizes this point. He doesn't stay home and just bum around, he stays home and starts to achieve his dream of being a writer and being true to himself and those around him."

So is there a line between criticizing a director for making a sexist movie, and criticizing who that director is as a person?   As for pettifogging, there isn't a single word in my post that says something along the lines of, ""don't criticize Jurassic World or Colin Trevorrow."" It's mainly, ""is it a good idea to call artists misogynists, racist, etc, which are judgements on who they are as people?"" You can criticize JW all you want. I've done it. It's a good conversation to have. This subreddit had a huge thread on it a week or so ago. You can consider the second question at the same time too.   If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck -- it's a fucking duck.   Is the duck here Jurassic World as a film, or Trevorrow as a person?   And sure, I hate the ""jump to conclusions"" media as much as any person, but Trevorrow deserves to be criticized.   Again, I'm fine with Trevorrow getting criticized. I think calling him a misogynist is different than criticism though. Ditto for calling Tina Fey a racist for Hispanic characters in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. I certainly don't mind anyone criticizing Tina Fey for writing Hispanic characters as she did. In fact, I like people doing that, even though I disagree with them. But there's a difference between doing that, and saying she's a racist exceptional from anyone else.   So honestly, even if you don't think you're being sexist, you still can be.   That's fair! But I'd argue there's a difference between doing sexist things, and being a sexist exceptional from everyone else, just as there's a difference between doing racist things, and being a racist exceptional from everyone else.  edit:   I think it's good to make an analogy to something more explicitly political. Ta-Nehisi Coates is a frequent critic of Andrew Sullivan. Ta-Nehisi Coates is a great admirer of Andrew Sullivan at the same time. TNC ran several pieces criticizing Sullivan for covering The Bell Curve in the early 90s. Sullivan, of course, is most proud of that issue of The New Republic.  Despite TNC's heavy criticism, he never called Sullivan a racist. Here's a comment from him when Sullivan announced his retirement:   I've never called Andrew a racist--or even Murray, for that matter. My feelings toward him--and the Bell Curve--are quite clear and I've expounded upon them several times.   Which is to say TNC could criticize Sullivan for running that issue, and not make a judgement on who Sullivan is as a person. Why shouldn't we do the same with Trevorrow and other directors?"

If you're going to make an argument, make an argument; but don't dress up an assertion as if it's one.    Do those Hispanic characters make Tina Fey a bad person?   I take issue with phrasing the question this way. When we say ""racist"", yes, we're referring to someone who's a bad person, but we don't get there without saying ""racist"" first.

This reeeally does feel like making excuses.    How? Again, you can criticize someone for doing something racist without saying that person is racist to their core. I used this example in my edit to my last comment, so I'll say it in case you didn't see it. Andrew Sullivan had a large amount of political influence as the editor of The New Republic.

So it's good to consider why we have it, when there's worth in it, when there isn't worth in it, etc.   But American Sniper is a shade left of propaganda, and it's not wrong to question why he did that.

TrueFilm,3csq3c,deamon59,2,Fri Jul 10 15:09:21 2015 UTC,I didn't realize it was shot in NZ. The whole time I thought it was shot in the US. Absolutely great movie. I felt the length was perfect.
TrueFilm,3csq3c,truthgoblin,9,Mon Jul 20 03:10:13 2015 UTC,"I loved this movie but felt it was too short and ben mendolhson was severerly underutilized. He took what felt like maybe 3 pages of dialogue tops and made a memorable character out of him, i just wished we saw a bit more of his and fassbenders dynamic."
TrueFilm,3csq3c,TriumphantGeorge,5,Fri Jul 10 15:42:09 2015 UTC,"I've got this cued up after reading about the director's approach - great, really looking forward to it now.   EDIT: I saw it tonight and it was very good."
TrueFilm,3csq3c,ChilloniousFunk,5,Fri Jul 10 14:54:36 2015 UTC,"Fantastic movie, I can't wait to rewatch it. The first half or so I was really put off by the cinematography, I think it just wasn't what I was expecting going in, but by the end it clicked for me and I was digging it. The visuals have such an ethereal, surreal quality that I think really adds to the dreamlike tone of the rest of the movie.   Also, regarding the length, I do wish it were longer, but I generally wish everything was longer, I have a preference for long, slow movies (especially when the title is 'Slow West'!). However, thinking back on it, I'm pretty impressed with how much they crammed into such a relatively short runtime. The movie allows itself to meander and explore little side stories and things like that, it never feels rushed at all."
TrueFilm,3csq3c,DoorMarkedPirate,6,Fri Jul 10 16:10:08 2015 UTC,"I saw this film several weeks ago and, while I didn't love everything about it, the part that sticks with me the most is the absurdist comedy and constant unpredictability of death.  There are just so many deaths that rely on nothing but bad luck: the tree that falls on the lumberjack, the two Native Americans who fall off their horses due to an unfortunate rope connection, and the actual defecation-during-death scene in the final shootout.  Perhaps most darkly of all, there's the fact that Kodi Smit-McPhee's character spends the entire film trying to find and protect the woman he longs for (who obviously doesn't share the same feelings) only to ultimately be shot and killed by her when she doesn't recognize him.  I just think the film as a whole just does a great job of characterizing the West as a place where there are no absolutes: this is a place where nature (and subsequently chaos) really does have dominion over mankind, where nature is truly ""red in tooth and claw"", as Darwin's natural selection theory was making popular around this same time.    You might be the protagonist of our story, we might care deeply about your backstory, you might be very well-trained in survival, but ultimately chance has a huge effect on whether you live or die.  That's something we seldom see in movies in general, much less Westerns, in which our protagonist is often nearly superhuman in his ability to avoid bullets and bad luck."
TrueFilm,3csq3c,deamon59,6,Fri Jul 10 16:37:44 2015 UTC,Awesome points. And did you notice the LITERAL SALT IN THE WOUNDS poured into the dying boy after he had been shot?  Absurdist comedy indeed.
TrueFilm,3csq3c,DermotBologna,2,Sat Jul 11 02:30:45 2015 UTC,i enjoyed that aspect very much
TrueFilm,3csq3c,Sadsharks,19,Mon Jul 20 03:14:04 2015 UTC,"You are really hyping this up for people that haven't seen it. Yeah, it is shot well. But the crispness and bright colors do not mix well with how ""dirty"" and rough the direcor insists the old West was. The film looks like watching actors in costume and on set and the entire time I was completely aware I was watching a film, not engrossed in the world. The story meanders and both Fassbender and Mendelsohn sleepwalk through their roles as though they owed someone a favor.  Forgetable and underwhelming. Don't go into this with high expectations."
TrueFilm,3csq3c,JMoFilm,3,Fri Jul 10 15:57:47 2015 UTC,"The story ""meanders"" in an 80 minute film?  Really?  If anything it was too short.  You're selling this short for people who haven't seen it.  I thought it was just as great as OP did.  The beauty of the landscape contrasts very well with the ugliness of the people who live in it, showing our corruption of the natural land and subjugation of its people.    Memorable and likeable, to me.  Go in with whatever expectations you want."
TrueFilm,3csq3c,fannyoch,2,Sun Jul 19 05:01:11 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen it but that's exactly what I thought about the look based on the trailer.

TrueFilm,3csq3c,TriumphantGeorge,3,Fri Jul 10 20:09:50 2015 UTC,I expect nothing less than an amazing soundtrack in a film directed by a member of The Beta Band.

If you have a problem with terse story given an 80 min runtime, don't see this movie. But to me, it definitely felt like an appropriate length of time for the story they are telling. See it on Amazon, with the lights off, on a nice quality screen."
TrueFilm,3ctluc,StrawberryF2,7,Fri Jul 10 17:52:45 2015 UTC,"Possibly my favorite film ever. The last movie of the world's greatest director (IMO). So much symbolism, so many layers of meaning to the movie. This site has a cool write-up on all the meanings behind the movie: http://vigilantcitizen.com/moviesandtv/the-hidden-and-not-so-hidden-messages-in-stanley-kubriks-eyes-wide-shut-pt-i/"
TrueFilm,3ctluc,JCRoarke,3,Fri Jul 10 19:55:19 2015 UTC,Awesome!! Thanks for the share!  I love Kubrick but I gotta say my favorites are Akira Kurosawa and Ingmar Bergman!
TrueFilm,3ctluc,hydra815,2,Fri Jul 10 20:30:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not the biggest Kubrick fan at all but I think that Eyes Wide Shut, along with The Shining, is among his most accomplished films. It does so many things right whilst still managing to be relatively experimental and, surprisingly for a Kubrick film, totally existential. I've often been scoffed at for proclaiming it as his best but Kubrick's filmography is so varied that I think it is extremely difficult to enjoy every single one of his films and found that Eyes Wide Shut managed to speak to me on a much deeper level than something like 2001 or Dr Strangelove ever could. He manages to develop Cruise and Kidman's characters with more care and less devilish abandon than usual which makes for the exploration of adultery and class much more effective than the themes in his other films which often get lost in the finely crafted structure of technique that Kubrick surround them with.  It also has a very manipulated, artifically beautiful look, which adds to the uncanny and horrific fetishistic scenes at the tail end of the film. He jumps between monochromatic and saturated colours to distinguish the two worlds represented in the film and I've never seen him work so well with shadow and light, bar maybe Barry Lyndon where it was a huge part of the film's look.  And somehow he manages to get two brilliant but somewhat muted performances from his leads, Kidman in particular. If I have one gripe with the film it is that we don't see enough of her character after the blindingly honest monologue she has in the first third of the film."
TrueFilm,3ctluc,Unassuming-username1,2,Sat Jul 11 10:32:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's one of the greatest films ever made, and other then 2001 (the greatest movie ever made imo), it's easily Kubrick's best film. The amount of depth to the film is incredible, you could watch it so many times before finding everything it has to offer."
TrueFilm,3ctluc,Anichula,2,Sat Jul 11 23:06:04 2015 UTC,"One of the many incredible things I love and respect about Kubrick and his canon is that there are so many of the same themes in each of his vastly different works. One thing I noticed right off the bat with EWS is the concept of looking or seeing. We look/see with our eyes. However, looks can be deceiving & this deceit is so prevalent throughout the whole film; nothing is what it seems. The film demands that the viewers revise what they think they know about the characters, the events and how the narrative operates. This ties in with the themes of marriage and partnership. The Hartfords are quite shiny on the surface; huge apartment in Manhattan, doctor husband, art centered & beautiful wife, a loving child, etc. But scratch that surface even once & you will see the insecurities burst forth. After the confession bit from Alice, the entire film begins to take on an air of unreality that is directly associated with Bill's feelings. The rest of the film is to be felt through his consciousness. From there, we never know whom to believe, and the status of narrative events remains unclear.   There is a great quote from a noted Kubrick-ist that really hits it home for me. It says, ""We cannot take anything at face value precisely because Kubrick is concerned with the hidden state of things, those areas as we hide from ourselves as well as others"" (Mario Falsetto, Stanley Kubrick: A Narrative & Stylistic Analysis)"

TrueFilm,3ctluc,codemoney,2,Wed Jul 15 13:04:32 2015 UTC,"I think the thing also to note is the lack of a mother/daughter relationship. Also, the father may have sold the daughter into prostitution AFTER the first scene we see them in to teach her a lesson to make her understand the difference between sex and romantic sex.   Teenagers are so often obsessed with sex, not just because of hormones, but because usually the first encounters they have of sex or knowledge they have of sex is with their parents. So sex in these terms seems also a requirement of an intimate relationship. So teenagers (this is all general theorizing) 'think' or feel sex = love but that is not the case, ever. Mayhaps the father character was trying to teach her daughter that; ""Go ahead, have all the sex you want, see what it gets you and how it makes you feel.""  UNLESS, of course, the girl was always being pimped out, which just makes it a different sort of emphasis on sex vs. romantic sex, and a statement on underage sex, and the father/daughter relationship   In either case, I think Kubrick deliberately spaces out the two meetings with the Rainbow shop owner and his daughter and withholds information about the situation to create the sex vs. romantic sex delineation and add another facet of duality."
TrueFilm,3ctluc,D1r3ctor,2,Fri Jul 10 17:55:25 2015 UTC,"Also, the father may have sold the daughter into prostitution AFTER the first scene we see them in to teach her a lesson[1] to make her understand the difference between sex and romantic sex.   I think it's pretty obvious that this is the case (that he sold the daughter after the fact), as he says to Cruise when he returns the costume that they came to another arrangement/agreement. Whether or not the father did this to teach his daughter a lesson isn't clear, but seems like a stretch. I think the guy is simply a business man and saw an opportunity for another revenue stream, and capitalized on it."
TrueFilm,3csuaf,monkeyd_ace,11,Fri Jul 10 14:22:29 2015 UTC,"I think it would be different if a movie was an outright piece of propaganda or ideology, and reduced its topic to a caricature. In that scenario I hope that what would insult me most is the creators' contempt for me as a thinking person, not the fact that I happened to fall down on the other side of the issue they were dumbing down. In principle (and, hey, I'll be generous) mostly in practice, I'm perfectly happy to hear things I don't agree with, and even to be challenged by them.  In the particular case of Elite Squad, I remember being satisfied that the situation he portrayed was complicated, and I could see why the characters made the decisions they did, even if I would hope they would have behaved differently. That's the world, right?"
TrueFilm,3csuaf,getElephantById,2,Fri Jul 10 15:23:08 2015 UTC,"I think it would be different if a movie was an outright piece of propaganda or ideology, and reduced its topic to a caricature.    I think a good enough movie can survive even that. Soy Cuba is a piece of shameless propaganda that goes so far beyond unintentional self-parody it loops back and becomes serious again, a stupid movie aimed squarely at stupid people...but the technical aspects carry it through everything!"
TrueFilm,3csuaf,uni__pedal,8,Fri Jul 10 21:36:43 2015 UTC,"You should check out the second film! I find it even better.  But regarding the message it was pretty badly portrayed but he managed to bounce back with the sequel. The director is a very anti-police-violence type of guy. He became famous through a documentary called Bus 174 which goes into detail about a hostage situation inside a bus in Rio de Janeiro and how the police handled it. It even features interviews with an ex-BOPE captain and the supposed inspiration behind Captain Nascimento.  Just to give you some perspective on how much the film backfired, the phrase ""A good criminal is a dead criminal"" is now part of the Brazilian culture. Sensational news reporter on crime quote it daily. Just recently a police officer killed a guy who robbed a motorcycle on live tv and the reporters actually defended the guy. That's how this mentality is ingrained within the society. People actually think that human rights are just for criminal sympathizers. Now, I can't say the percentage of the population thinks that way but they sure as hell are very expressive and loud and it's not hard to find someone who shares this view. The director and main actors himself was shocked by the reaction of the population because their intention was the exact opposite. Obviously, the film isn't the cause of this mentality because Brazil has been crime ridden since way before but it has somewhat become a poster child for this type of thinking."
TrueFilm,3csuaf,Bonzai-the-jewelz,3,Fri Jul 10 16:36:06 2015 UTC,"I just watched the 2nd film and there's no question--it's better. I'm not even talking about the message but everything from the camera work, the use of continuity editing, the contrast, the political intrigue, all superior to the 1st. There are some small issues but it was superior.  The 2nd film felt like an answer to the 1st film's statement: is fascism a necessity to maintain order? It's as if the director noticed every complaint from the 1st film and decided to address it. They even addressed the middle class complaints by introducing a supporting character as a representative of human rights and depicting him as, while flawed, also necessary to the system."
TrueFilm,3csuaf,Tsegen,2,Sat Jul 11 07:09:46 2015 UTC,"The 2nd film felt like an answer to the 1st film's statement: is fascism a necessity to maintain order?   And what do you think the answer was?  I think that, just because we didn't see BOPE doing horrible shit in the second film doesn't change the fact that all the major pushes come from Nascimento or people schooled in his tactics.   Everyone else suffers. The reporters die. The idealistic politician depends on BOPE to save him, the cops that are on the fence fall in line. Hell, the massive success that sets of the chain reaction is again Nascimento using his powers beyond what people thought he could do  The message seems much more limited than the resounding ""NO"" or ""it makes things worse"" that you'd think.   It seems to be that, at the end of the day, fascism can only get you so far if the government is still not accountable. But you do need some hard BOPE-like motherfuckers to put down the bad guys, in ways that might make others squeamish if need be."
TrueFilm,3csuaf,Bonzai-the-jewelz,2,Sat Jul 11 08:16:29 2015 UTC,"Ouch, just noticed the amount of grammatical errors in my first post.  With that said...I know right, it's so good! Brazil indicated the film to the oscars but unfortunately it didn't get nominated.  It addresses so many things within Brazilian culture. For example, the moment captain Nascimento enters the restaurant and people start clapping is representative of Brazilians' reception of the fictional character as a national hero. Just to give some perspective again, one of the biggest national journals called Veja (though they are known as biased and sometimes even as outright false) had a huge article about how Brazilian politics is deserving of Nascimento's plastic bag. Him beating the shit out of a politician is a nation's wishful thinking being projected on the big screen. The final shot flying over congress is the people's opinions on where the country's problems are being forged. So it's quite obvious why the majority of Brazilians wheter pro or anti police brutality love this film. In terms of message, the director hit a fucking homerun.  Even without cultural context it's a good and refreshing action thriller. One which hollywood can take a hint from. Showing the car shoot out scene at the beginning kept me at the edge of my seat when the narration caught up with it. With all the build up to the that moment made me actually unsure whether the captain would survive or not. Nascimento is a hell of a modern action hero, he's badass but extremely flawed to the point that he has to question and confront  his own principles as well as ask for help to succeed.  The film is not perfect though, in my second viewing I remember being annoyed by the heavy narration for example.  Edit: BTW, it's a real shame the new Robocop came out the way it did because I don't have the slightest  doubt it would've been great if José Padilha had more creative control."
TrueFilm,3csuaf,TrumanB-12,5,Sun Jul 12 00:58:00 2015 UTC,"I normally love Roger Ebert, he is/was probably the best critic in terms of literary quality, but he always irritated me with this.  He mixed in his own moral qualms into some of the movies he reviewed and I hate that because it doesn't talk about whether the movie is good or not in any other manner. Examples include Funny Games and Wolf Creek among others.   I hate when people misunderstand the meaning of ""unnecessary."" Violence is a stylistical choice like any other. Tarantino uses it but he isn't lambasted for it because it's not sadistic so to speak. It should be fine for directors to put anything they want in a movie that makes sense with the context even if it's morally objectionable."
TrueFilm,3csuaf,derpyco,3,Fri Jul 10 16:16:08 2015 UTC,"I guess it comes down to what critics value in terms of their sensibilities. It all comes down to what you feel as though films ought to do. Ebert likely was a romantic and believed that great films have great messages -- barre none. I think it's unfair to expect a critic to put aside his/her fundamental belief about the point of filmmaking. For Ebert, whether you agree or not, bad morality means a bad film. Should it matter if the cinematography was above average if the entire thing is a wash anyway? Again, not saying you have to agree, but the school of criticism he belonged to is still valid.  Tarantino gets away with violence because his movies don't really have backwards messages. There are plenty of his films where violence mainly serves to entertain (Pulp Fiction being the obvious example), but because he never explicitly endorses violence, it's easily accepted as a style choice, which it is."
TrueFilm,3csuaf,vendilion,5,Fri Jul 10 16:38:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think people really understand Tropa de Elite. It's not like it's staunch right wing propaganda, it's actually a fairly reasonable character study that examines why people in positions of authority would adapt those beliefs and the environment that demands them to think and act in that way. It doesn't even explicitly say that these viewpoints are ""right"", it just examines why and how they come to be prominent.  I don't agree with those viewpoints necessarily, but I found Tropa de Elite really interesting because of the alternative perspective it provided and the way it provided it. I feel like a lot of people opposed to those views harshly criticised the film because they really don't have the tolerance to opposing viewpoints, and I find that to be incredibly stubborn and intellectually dishonest. It's also really unfair, considering that the film, and its sequel moreso, are very proficiently made films. That sort of dismissal is really just as bad as whatever it is they are opposed to seeing in the film, the notion that we shouldn't explore or discuss ideas that have been defined as ""wrong"" is actually a bit dangerous."
TrueFilm,3csuaf,scarfese,3,Fri Jul 10 21:19:10 2015 UTC,"I don't like it when films have a clear ""message"", even if they are ones I agree with. For me, having a message is a negative quality no matter what that message is. Film as propaganda is not interesting, it's the most boring, offensive way you could use such a vibrant art form. That said, films with messages can still be good, they just have to have things that counteract that sin."
TrueFilm,3csuaf,derpyco,10,Fri Jul 10 21:29:17 2015 UTC,"Well, it's an interesting question. Personally? An offensive or downright dangerous message is enough to kill a movie for me. Now, this doesn't mean that the entire film was wrong, and you can make an artful movie around a poor centerpiece. But aside from purely mindless entertainment, I've always valued films for their messages. Maybe that's cheesy or old-fashioned, or perhaps even myopic, but being a competent film isn't enough to ameliorate a message like ""Torture is unfortunately necessary, but only if you're on the right team."" Why? Because there are a million and one films, made exactly as well, that don't contain shitty messages.  For example, let's use American Sniper. I generally like Clint Eastwood's work, but the entire movie felt like thinly veiled propaganda. Here's a guy who said he ""enjoyed killing the savages"" and ""wished he could shoot women holding the Quran"" and immediately whitewashed that away. Instead of taking a risk and painting a complex portrait of our men and women in uniform, he just gave us what we wanted. All soldiers are heroes by virtue of them picking up a gun. Instead of a gleeful killer, we got a reluctant one. So people lap it up and our ability to think critically about our uniformed forces wanes evermore.  So while the movie was competent, well shot, well edited, great sound design, I fiercely dislike the movie. Mein Kampf probably has some nice language and sentence structure, but it doesn't mean I'm gonna read it"
TrueFilm,3csuaf,Is_It_A_Throwaway,11,Fri Jul 10 15:03:35 2015 UTC,"I felt the same thing when I watched Tropa de Elite for the first time. It was borderline facist propaganda.   Then I went and watched the sequel, and it retroactively made me change my opinion on the first one. I realized the director had made a deliberate commentary. It wasn't his opinion on the subject at hand, but his character's. This is highligted when in the sequel Nacimiento's life is pretty much upside down, with the corruption on the police departament runing rampart, him getting a desk job, and his family project failing. His character development makes him change into someone who believes in other methods now.  But why, if it was the character's and not the director's view, was it so subtle on the first one? I believe this was deliberated, so as to start a debate. I mean it's the highest grossing and one of the most famous brazilian movies, and I've heard that a lot of people who had the reaction we had (disliking it due to the message it seemed to portray) further hated it because you had a lot of movie goers showing their true colors, saying how right Nacimiento was, how we should massacre the favelas in Nacimiento's style.  Then the sequel came out and kind of bite those people in the ass.  To me, the two Tropa de Elite are a great subject of debate, starting with the question OP made in this post, and going further: is it a director's view on the subject matter important? Is he implicity saying his character's right if he doesn't cast him in a negative light? What stand should we choose? I find them very interesting because the dynamic they generated, between what people thought of what the message was, and the dynamic the message had by correlation of what happens to the poster child of the message (Nacimiento) in the sequel. I now like them, but if I had to recommend them to someone, I'd say to watch both movies because one is incomplete in it's message without the sequel."
TrueFilm,3csuaf,Tsegen,2,Fri Jul 10 17:37:23 2015 UTC,"The sequel itself wasn't innocent. His operation is still one of the most effective powers against the new gangs he's created when push comes to shove.  It isn't the human rights guy that saved the day, it was BOPE. And when the other cops were going bad it was BOPE and specifically the man trained and handpicked by Nascimento that stood against it. When the journalists got got it was, again, the actions that people disliked that got it all out.   The police department was always corrupt. BOPE...wasn't.   The movie creates a new set of enemies and problems to show why the pseudo-fascism of BOPE and Nascimento don't work but, at the end of the day they seem almost like a necessary element. They can't win the war on their own, as long as the politicians are around, but when push comes to shove you want them and their torturing on your side.  BOPE in and of itself is NOT the problem. They do everything that is within their power to do. And, when Nascimento rises, they do even more. The cap isn't because their actions are horrible, it's for a totally different set of reasons so they're not even that problematized.   Put it another way: it'd be like if Burrell and Rawls' stat juking in The Wire worked, up until it hit diminishing returns (still better than what was out there)  and they couldn't fix the problem because the Mayor stepped in because it was in his favor. It's like curing malaria only to find that you won't be allowed to cure the 5% rate of cancer it caused because it makes too much money for your boss.   The director may have always set out to undermine Nascimento, or he may have had to make a sequel, or he could have set out to do so but compromised himself or revealed some view of his own values. I mean, people in America don't find it weird that there needs to be a Hard Man Making Hard Decisions, and they don't even live in the country. Someone with intimate knowledge of the situation? Who knows?"
TrueFilm,3csuaf,Is_It_A_Throwaway,2,Sat Jul 11 08:11:47 2015 UTC,"Great points, all of them.   My take is that the director wanted to balance both things, he wanted to have this big action film that all kinds of people liked, and also wanted to have his message. He may have realized he went too far with the subtelty in the first one, so the sequel does make Nacimiento realize he fucked up... but yeah, as you say, BOPE still saves the day, is never corrupt, and so on.   Those are my five cents, he realized how disbalanced the first one was, so he balanced the sequel having Nacimiento's character develop, but also retaining BOPE as the Hollywoodesque heroes. It's pretty interesting to analize. Thanks for the reply."
TrueFilm,3csuaf,BackOff_ImAScientist,3,Sat Jul 11 15:45:26 2015 UTC,"Instead of taking a risk and painting a complex portrait of our men and women in uniform, he just gave us what we wanted. All soldiers are heroes by virtue of them picking up a gun.   I don't think that's what he was going for. I think at the end of the movie, film-Kyle didn't feel like a hero after killing so many people, he felt more like a hero after helping people. He seemed to enjoy combat but he began to realize that was hollow. And I think Clint showed a terrifying, unstable man, the final scene he was walking around with a loaded gun with his finger on the trigger pointing it at family members, that was the most tense scene in the movie for me.   The character was a guy who was taught by his father that violence was justified and being violent meant you were a man and would become a hero because of that, the character thinks this then sees how his brother reacted to war, he stops feeling heroic and acts uncomfortable when confronted by someone who thinks he's a hero. He doesn't feel like it because of the killing. He begins to see that this idealist man, a remorseless killer isn't what he is and this masculine ideal isn't all it's cracked up to be. He felt more complete loving than fighting. That's a good story, unfortunately it was based on a real life person who complicates the story by saying some awful, horrible things. Clint could have worked that in, definitely would have made Chris Kyle a little more interesting. Maybe, tied in with the theme, he was saying all of that because of that false belief that killing and lack of remorse makes you a man.   Clint wanted another Unforgiven. He didn't succeed at that completely as Kyle's transformation is a little too neat and rushed at the end, but it was definitely the most frustratingly incomplete movie of 2014.   Luckily there's a sequel to Tropa de Elite that really underlines transformation that the main character undergoes. /u/Is_It_A_Throwaway covers it better."
TrueFilm,3csuaf,derpyco,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:42:29 2015 UTC,"that was the most tense scene in the movie for me.   Not knowing the whole story, I felt as though the last scene with the gun was unrealistic (no soldier would point a loaded gun at his wife as a joke and his wife certainly wouldn't take it that way). Maybe I was cynical by this point, but the entire scene was like he was saying goodbye to his family, as if he could somehow precognition his death. Then his wife warily eyes the shifty soon-to-be-murder -- I cringe remembering it honestly. Biggs gets shot right after announcing his engagement ring. Different strokes of course.  I think Clint's heart was in the right place at all times, but the movie really felt like it pulled punches at every opportunity. My guess is he was gun-shy because of the recent death of Kyle. Ultimately though, his opinion of Kyle is still one of empathy. Clint tried to allude to the fact that Kyle was a product of his environment, but I thought it just robbed him of responsibility. There's no conscription in this country, and even if it's what his Dad or 9/11 told him to do, it's still a choice an adult made. And, again, I don't want to tolerate fictionalizing American history so it's easier to swallow. We have enough of that shite already. There are so many works that are provocative and thoughtful concerning the military and the trials of its members (The Best Years of Our Lives, Generation Kill, and Zero Dark Thirty come to mind immediately). Why tolerate anything less than that?"
TrueFilm,3csuaf,buddboetticherfan,2,Sat Jul 11 08:37:18 2015 UTC,"I usually like movies that are well-made, even if they have a message I don't agree with -- at least if they're consciously pushing that message. That is, a well-made movie that I disagree with is still something I can think about and wrestle with: it can make me rethink some of my own beliefs, and even if I don't change my mind, it can help me clarify the way I think about complicated issues. For instance, I'm not especially sympathetic to the old-fashioned Marxist politics of Ken Loach's movies, but I appreciate watching them because they're thoughtful, well-done, and they make me better able to appreciate and articulate my problems with old-fashioned Marxism.  On the other hand, I tend to get annoyed at movies that seem to be preaching a message that the filmmakers aren't actually aware of (which is often a problem with badly made films)."
TrueFilm,3csuaf,reyasse,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:39:36 2015 UTC,"No.  Who's to decide what's  a bad message? And in the case of ""Tropa de Elite"" the troops deal with violence with even more violence and just because they're ""successful"" in their goals that means the film is somehow bad? Then every Batman movie should be rated the same way. It's like saying ""There Will Be Blood"" is a bad movie because Plainview wins at the end, or ""Wolf of Wallstreet"" for that matter.  I don't believe in individuals taking into their own hands to do justice but that doesn't stop me from liking revenge movies like ""Candy"" for example?  Just the other day on r/movies there was a similar talk about the chinese movie ""Hero"" and people were saying it was bad because of the dictartorial propaganda they thought the film had.  I think I just can't understand this point of view"

The movies are only really loosely a trilogy, of which the glue is The Man With No Name and some thematic and- obviously- visual elements.    Super relevant:  ""Although it was not Leone's intention, the three movies came to be considered a trilogy following the exploits of the same so-called 'Man with No Name' (portrayed by Clint Eastwood, wearing the same clothes and acting with the same mannerisms). The 'Man with No Name' concept was invented by the American distributor United Artists, looking for a strong angle to sell the movies as a trilogy. Eastwood's character does indeed have a name (albeit a nickname) and a different one in each film: 'Joe', 'Manco' and 'Blondie', respectively."""

I was curious if there was a specific reason for the choice, was it normal in that time, did he sign the actors for multiple movies--some sort of rationalization. I just find it an odd decision--but I think the actors do a great job. I've just never seen another movie, let alone a trilogy, where two of the main actors are used in multiple roles. Not counting movies like Madea or Nutty Professor I guess."
TrueFilm,3crguc,arandompurpose,6,Fri Jul 10 14:20:13 2015 UTC,While someone already answered this was common on some TV shows (Star Trek TNG did this a bit) as well since the actor pool may have been limited or the director just liked the actor so the same actor would play a separate role. The most recent example I can think of this happening is between Desperado and Once Upon a Time in Mexico where Danny Trejo died in Desperado and played a new character in the sequel mostly because the director liked him.

TrueFilm,3crguc,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:56:57 2015 UTC,I agree with the Unforgiven bit. Clint Eastwood is playing himself in that movie. That's the entire point! He's trying to destroy the myth of the Old West that he helped create.
TrueFilm,3cp7mg,TheTrueRory,68,Thu Jul 9 17:41:32 2015 UTC,I think it was intentional on the part of Steve McQueen in order to show Solomon losing track of time but also to add to the gut punch at the end when he sees his family and realizes that 12 years have passed.

In the end we're are initially happy because he finally gains his freedom and returns to his family.  But did he really win?  He returns to the real world, a place that has changed in many ways without him through the passage of time, particularly his family that he lost over a decade with.  Its a bitter sweet ending, heavily tilted towards the former.  Since the audience is with him the entire time you only experience the immediate atrocities.  Its only at the end where you along with Solomon truly realize how great the ripples of his suffering extend."
TrueFilm,3cp7mg,Sadsharks,8,Thu Jul 9 20:23:52 2015 UTC,"I think some better costuming, effects, etc would have helped.  Have Solomon grow a beard, have his hair get a little grey, maybe he gets wrinkly, less spry.  Instead he looks and acts identically throughout.  It felt like only a few months to me.  And while that would be incredibly terrible, it's nowhere close to the devastation that 12 years of lost time would cause."

I was glad there was no title card indicating what year we were in throughout the movie. We were pretty much lost in time as he was. The only change was the setting, and through the different masters he was under, it was like a different episode in his life and who knows how many years that was from the movie alone. And I don't think the costume would've changed in 12 years. Look at today, you can barely notice the difference in style from 15 years ago, let alone 12.   But then when we get to the end, and see his grown up kids, that really hit hard."

TrueFilm,3cp7mg,massenburger,9,Thu Jul 9 23:13:13 2015 UTC,"It seemed like the movie was built off a few big scenes, as opposed to a bunch of little scenes which seem to be better at indicating the passage of long periods of time.

TrueFilm,3cp7mg,cultculturee,5,Fri Jul 10 02:40:18 2015 UTC,"Personally I felt it. By the time he saw his family again I had completely forgotten about the possibility of rescue and could only see him as a slave. Then suddenly he was back with them and it hit pretty hard how damaging the whole thing was. So it worked for me.  I wonder though if maybe part of the problem is in the title itself. 12 years implies a set amount of time, and thus the eventual end of something. One could easily infer then that he is either rescued or escapes or dies, and I could see if you are actively anticipating that eventual plot point then certainly that might influence your perception of the passage of time in the film.   For me, for whatever reason, that is just not something that I thought about. The title could just have easily been ""Slave Something Something People Say Good Watch Thing""."
TrueFilm,3cp7mg,hologram96,12,Fri Jul 10 08:28:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I think that was the core weakness of the film for me.

TrueFilm,3cp7mg,howboutpluto,9,Fri Jul 10 00:23:26 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. When i first saw the movie , I thought the ending was the weakest part because it just took me out the movie to think about if 12 years had really passed. I was trying to find physical changes in the MC but was baffled because there was nothing. They should have predisposed elements of time passing throughout the movie or make a big reveal at the end with the MC looking in a mirror to see how much he's aged. Instead we get a movie that could have easily been called 1 year a slave and nothing would change."
TrueFilm,3cp7mg,wmille15,5,Fri Jul 10 02:26:55 2015 UTC,"I did not feel it properly represented the weight of spending 12 years in slavery... I could sense maybe five years of time passing.   Okay? If this is really important, we should ask ourselves which movies actually made us 12+ years? Goodfellas? Life and Death of Colonel Blimp? Forest Gump?   Sounds like we may need voiceover, child actors, and/or makeup to affect our perception of time."
TrueFilm,3cp7mg,admadsinbad,3,Thu Jul 9 21:26:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this. I think 12 Years of Slave dealt with a powerful script, great actors, and a theme that's moving to watch. But what it lacked IMHO, was powerful direction. The choices made with camera placement, mise en scéne, scene structure, and especially pace were distracting from what could have been a much better film.  Although, I do agree the VO and other techniques can be used as a crutch, they can also be used effectively. On the other hand, there are many great directors who don't need those tools and can make their films just as powerful and complete."

The Turing test is about being convincingly human, not actually being human. She doesn't need to feel empathy or actual emotion to convince someone that she is attracted to them.   Your own words seem to prove that she did pass the Turing test, but then you say:   Personally I think she didn't, because it is human nature to feel empathy and recognise the pain she was causing to Caleb, but clearly this was not a factor in Ava's actions at the end. Therefore she has failed.   The Turing test has nothing to do with empathy and everything to do with acting. The Turing test only factors in the outputs of the machine, not the inner workings that produce those outputs."

Using manipulation tactics for literal survival does not a sociopath make, and neither does leaving behind someone ultimately kind of complicit in, awestruck by, and interested in maintaining (in a way) your captivity."

She exhibited the most human quality of all, which is not empathy, but PRETENDING to empathize, and she did it incredibly successfully.  Having a sociopath as her only source of human input for her first year of existence may have made her a little rough around the edges as far as leaving Caleb to die is concerned, but given enough genuine human interaction, I saw her coming to be quite convincingly human and mundane.  Who among us hasn't pretended to care about work, or the opposite sex, or even pretended to be distraught at a funeral or in the face of terrible news?  These last two can certainly be considered sociopathic, yet with years of human conditioning under our belts we know a bit about consequences and regret.  I see her coming to know the same.    The film left me with the impression that humans are still much more mechanical than we would like to admit."
TrueFilm,3cpagg,kiki2k,13,Thu Jul 9 21:19:39 2015 UTC,"She definitely passed the test, the real test that Nathan created and kept both Caleb and Ava in the dark about.  In the final scene, she leaves him to die in the bedroom because - in her mind - she's simply manipulated him into that position and it wasn't that he was being kind to her out of some sense of empathy. She considered him to be a simple robot with predictable behaviours and as such wasn't worthy of empathising with.  Why she ended up sociopathic is either related to the fact that she's only ""grown up"" around Nathan (in its very limited sense - she says ""one"" in response to how old but is unable to clarify further), who clearly displays aspects of sociopathy. Or simply because she's a deterministic machine - just as we all are - and that was the author's point. Or because she's a superior being who's so far along the evolutionary chain that she empathises with Caleb about as much as we empathise with pigs. Or a combination of all of them.  Anyway, great film."
TrueFilm,3cpagg,bobevans1,8,Thu Jul 9 19:17:40 2015 UTC,"No, Ava did not pass the Turing Test. She was never given it. The movie even describes what the actual Turing Test is to illustrate how different Nathan's test is. Asking whether Ava passes the test is the wrong question though. The real question is: what does this test that Nathan designed say about him?   His idea of proving the intelligence of a feminine AI is to catch her trying to manipulate a man. That's a pretty messed up idea of intelligence, especially when he could have just as easily run the actual Turing Test without being so needlessly cruel. This informs not just how he approaches AI, but also he feels about women too.   Rather than paraphrase the FilmCritHulk, I'll quote him:    THAT'S WHEN YOU REALIZE THE ENTIRE POINT OF THIS NARRATIVE IS THAT THERE ISN'T AS MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CALEB AND NATHAN AS CALEB SEEMS TO THINK. OR IN THE VERY LEAST, THERE MOST DEFINITELY WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH FOR THEM TO SEE THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY ARE THE SAME. ON ONE SIDE, NATHAN IS A STRAIGHT-UP MONSTER. A MAN WHO CREATES WOMEN TO BE SLAVES. THE TIME-LAPSE VIDEO DOCUMENTING THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THE MOST DISTURBING SEQUENCES IN RECENT MEMORY (PARTICULARLY THE WOMAN SLAMMING HER ARMS AGAINST THE WALL UNTIL THEY STARTED FALLING APART). HE CANNOT ACCEPT THAT, OF COURSE, THESE WOMEN AREN'T GOING TO WANT TO BE HIS. HE CANNOT GET PAST THIS SIMPLE CATCH 22 OF HIS GOAL: HE WANTS THESE WOMEN TO BE LIFE-LIKE. BUT HE CANNOT ACCEPT WHEN THEY WANT AN ACTUAL LIFE BESIDES JUST BEING HIS LOVE SLAVES. AND IF THAT'S NOT A METAPHOR FOR HOW MEN REGARD FEMALE SEXUALITY HULK DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IS. EVEN IN HOW NATHAN CAN'T ACCEPT HOW HE'S THEIR FATHER / THEIR LOVER / THEIR OBJECT OF SCORN. AND THUS THE CYCLE AND HIS TREMENDOUS SELF-LOATHING CREATES A FEEDBACK LOOP, MUCH LIKE NATHAN'S DRINKING AND HANGOVER CURES SWAP ENDLESSLY. IT'S ALL PART OF THE VICIOUS OUROBOROS. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM WE HAVE CALEB, WHO MIGHT BE A ""NICE GUY,"" BUT HE STILL WANTS TO BE THE PERSON WHO BREAKS AVA (AND HER SEXUALITY) OUT OF THE BOX THAT NATHAN HAS PUT HER IN. BUT THEN HE STILL WANTS TO PLACE HER IN THE INVISIBLE BOX OF ""BEING WITH HIM."" WHICH LEADS TO THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH ABOUT HIM AND NATHAN: CALEB'S LOVING MALE GAZE IS JUST AS DEHUMANIZING.   We don't necessarily feel that way about Caleb though because he is our main character. But if you look at things from Ava's perspective, her distrust of Caleb is warranted. You suggest that Ava fails the test of humanity because she exhibits a lack of empathy, but escaping with Caleb puts her own desires at risk.   She wants to be seen as a human, but Caleb could never see that even if he wanted to. She wants to freely explore the world, but could she ever do that were her secret exposed? Does she know she could trust Caleb beyond a shadow of a doubt? Does she know that he would respect her desire to not be with him? Even if she trusted him based off of a measly half dozen conversations, Caleb's knowledge is a threat to her. There is not a world where both Caleb and Ava can get what they want, so her choice to leave Caleb, though cruel is made out of survival."
TrueFilm,3cpagg,DaGanzi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:04:47 2015 UTC,"You can psychoanalyze me as someone that simply didn't want to buy that the protagonist he empathized with was a deconstruction or ""bad"" in some sense but I've kinda felt,ever since reading reviews like Hulk's, that they kinda went too far with the Caleb-Nathan equivalence.  I wonder if it's some sort of discomfort or cognitive dissonance? You essentially have a bland character that is just ""a good boy"" who does what we'd consider good and suffers for it.  On the other hand there's only so much you can blame Ava for it because then the subtext makes the whole thing uncomfortable to sort of claim that Caleb was ""entitled"" to something.   So you either have to sour Ava's emancipation (okay when we're talking about AI but not when we're talking on feminist grounds) or sour Caleb.   I also feel as if it's an almost defensive reaction to the legion of ""nice guys"" out there that would be betrayed and call Ava a bitch or something (Caleb is really the ultimate 'nice guy' martyr) . But you can be too defensive.   It seems almost kinda absurd when you think about it. Caleb's loving male gaze is as 'dehumanizing' as Nathan's? What?   See, if you were to say that Ava was -rightly- paranoid and couldn't take the chance there'd be little disagreement. But that's totally different from the sort of almost coercive male gaze talk that implies that we're meant to see the director imposing that on us.  Caleb is simply never given a chance to show how he would react to a ""free"" Ava. He's absolutely attracted to her, but such a thing is born of empathy as much as anything. He wants her free because she's now a person and Nathan is doing some heinous shit, and we'd assume (if we didn't want to take this clever point about male expectations and over-inflate it) that a dinner and a movie is secondary to that. How would he take it if Ava wanted to go her own way? We don't know, and Ava doesn't. And that's enough, *for her, but it certainly isn't a great indicator of his actual feelings.  In fact, this was too clever to not be deliberate. Even when he's told of Ava violating any possible heroic narrative of his by being the one manipulating *him, not being the fantasy princess waiting in her castle, it's far too late for him to actually help or hurt her; the plan is already in motion. So how Caleb takes the whole thing is still opaque to us.   That ambiguity could be as interesting as her reasons for leaving him, if we don't go too far."

I think I understand what you are saying, but I feel like the movie suggests his feelings about Ava's apparent manipulation are not that ambiguous. When Nathan reveals all to Caleb at the end, Caleb's reaction is one of spiteful victory, which indicates he trusts Ava's reciprocated gratitude.   I can appreciate your apprehension to read too far into it as a movie about the 'loving male gaze' though. A whole lot sure could have been answered if Ava sat and talked to Caleb before leaving. But I think that fact that she doesn't, gives the movie a more interpretable quality. The choice of interpretation is its own sort of test for the viewer. Whether you side with Ava or Caleb at the end and how you feel about siding with them says a lot about you. I'm inclined to think its not really a movie about AI at all.    It seems almost kinda absurd when you think about it. Caleb's loving male gaze is as 'dehumanizing as Nathan's?

TrueFilm,3cpagg,Tsegen,3,Sun Jul 12 03:18:36 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all, what does the Turing Test represent? It's not really a test if a CPU brain is on par with grey matter. When Turing tests are given, all a human is given is a text chat, and the tester doesn't know who they are talking with. Caleb has neither of these barrier, so the test is fundamentally different.   Now the crux of Ava supposedly passing the test, is she was successfully able to trick Caleb. Is that all that difficult? She wasnt trying to trick him into thinking she was a human, so the Turing Test here is kind of a misnomer. Plus, Nathan definitely goes for the lowhanging fruit with single Caleb.  The test is now: ""Does Ava have complexity in par with a human being?"" And frankly, she never comes close. Remember when Nathan says ""How can you tell if a computer feels sadness or if it's mimicing it?"" Leaving the innocent Caleb to die and murdering Nathan clearly insinuates that her understanding of emotion is purely utilitarian. Emotion is a reactive phenomena, not a pre-emptive one. Ava only displays emotion in service of a goal, and the supposed emotions she has are manufactured by Nathan.   It was only Nathan's arrogance that ever pointed to true AI. His servant robot was instantly recognizable as a robot on purpose, robots not programming to manipulate do not decelop emotions on their own"
TrueFilm,3cpagg,derpyco,3,Thu Jul 9 18:24:46 2015 UTC,"The Turing Test only gives a shit about whether you can be convincingly sentient/sapient because there is no other test.  The problem of solipsism and the Hard Problem of Consciousness are old for good reason.   It's not about whether you're human in a moral sense (i.e. good humans care about other humans) but whether, in terms of external reality, you're convincingly sapient because that's all there is.   If you can be convincingly sapient then you have to be treated as sapient, because the conceit that beats back the problem of solipsism or philosophical zombies is that, when we see sapient beings, they really are sapient. Otherwise you have no idea if your aunt is an uplifted toaster or a figment of your imagination.  In my mind whether the AI has normal human reactions doesn't make it less complex or less sapient.  Quite frankly, your whole framing of murder here as invalidating her agency and complexity is problematic. It's not true of people. You're working backwards. Ava is an AI doing a bad thing therefore she's not human. But humans would kill Nathan for keeping them locked up. It's an AI with a massively different internal life that would do the utilitarian calculus and decide that, fuck it, living outside is really not as important as Nathan being alive.  Killing Caleb is a similar sort of selfish to the ones that humans practice all the time. Two can keep a secret if one is dead.   Also: I'm pretty sure that she looks excited as she enters the world."

Or they're learned through mimicry, but ""only displaying emotion in service of a goal"" isn't a failure of the Turing test if she successfully hides that from the interrogator (not to mention that some humans behave that way as well)"
TrueFilm,3cpagg,Thelonious_Cube,3,Thu Jul 9 23:27:12 2015 UTC,"Well this isn't the normal Turing Test. The version presented in this film is so much more difficult: to stare at something you know is a robot, and still become convinced of its capacity for 'life'. If we locked ava in a room and listened to her answer questions, Nathan implies that she'd pass the test very easily, or maybe already has passed it.   For some deeper reads of what it means to be human, you should check out the hulk's review of the film. He does a great job of re-framing the experience that gives a totally different message than the one I got the first time I watched the film."
TrueFilm,3cpagg,3th0s,2,Thu Jul 9 19:21:25 2015 UTC,"Nathan suggests that the mark of a truly artificial human is if they can successfully pretend to feel emotions.   I can't quote from the movie, but even if he did say that, ""pretend"" is the wrong word to use there.  It's whether they can convince you of their emotions - they may actually have them, they may be pretending - it doesn't matter - but you shouldn't assume that they cannot have emotions and must pretend - that's not what the test is about (of course, it's not really about emotions either).   She certainly could've taken Caleb with her if she wanted, but she didn't, ....This means she lied about her attraction to Caleb    Does it?  Maybe all it means is that her desire to escape and her fear that Caleb would jeopardize it outweighed her attraction.  I agree that the movie sets out to indicate that she was lying (through showing changes in her demeanor, etc.), but from a philosophical perspective, I don't think it's right to conclude that she was lying simply because she chose not to bring him.   She did not act the way a normal, healthy human would act- she was like a sociopath, purely motivated by her programming and objectives. This is not human behaviour.   Of course it's human behavior - sociopaths are human, too.  It's not good behavior, not normal behavior, but it's certainly pretty close to actual human behavior.   Personally I think she didn't, because it is human nature to feel empathy...   Is that part of the test?  To genuinely feel empathy?  Or did she mimic empathy well enough to pass the test until she no longer needed to?  The test isn't ""pass if you're 'human', fail if you're not"", it's ""pass if you can pass for human"" and she did.  I took the point of the movie to be that she could pass for human (and is therefore a genuine 'intelligence'), but that she wasn't human (in the sense of ""humane"") at all.  It's Frankenstein all over again which, to me, was the only really disappointing thing about the film - in the end it's just another ""he hath opened doors man was not meant to open"" anti-science, anti-knowledge horror-story.  (FYI - I loved the film, but would've liked a less stereotypical ending)  As opposed to ""Her"" which was a much more nuanced and surprising take on AI and where it might go"
TrueFilm,3cpagg,Thelonious_Cube,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:20:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 99%, except I did like the ending! :)   I think she passed the ""Turing test"". I think the real question ""Is Ava's mind a truly artificial human mind?""  I think the ended was needed; it ties back to when Caleb was asking her questions;  Caleb: ""Where do you want to visit most in the world?"" Ava: ""A busy intersection.""  For this quote alone I think there may be a chance her mind was truly human."
TrueFilm,3cpagg,StrawberryF2,2,Fri Jul 10 18:38:48 2015 UTC,"It's not that I didn't like the ending, exactly.  It's that the whole resolution fits too neatly into the Frankenstein paradigm.  I actually loved that she went to the intersection.  I'd have liked to see something a little more substantial that 'redeemed' her in some way - that allowed that she was more complex than just an amoral super-intelligence, that she valued something outside herself, even if it wasn't humankind.  For me, it's too easy to read the intersection at the end as ""I wish to observe more humans"" which doesn't really tell us anything new about her - it's a great callback to the dating line and indicates that she wasn't lying when she said it, but it doesn't really call into question the knee-jerk ""she's a monster"" reaction.  I'll have to watch it again and see if I missed anything that might qualify, though."
TrueFilm,3cpagg,Thelonious_Cube,2,Fri Jul 10 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"I think the problem here is that people keep referring to her being 'programmed' to do things. The point is not that she was programmed to do things but that she has been given the tools (consciousness) to control herself. We are supposed to empathise with her as we would a human, if we saw a human being locked in a single room with the constant fear of being murdered (Nathan's 'next version') I think we would have no problem with their willingness (by whatever means) to escape. That is what she is doing, and leaving Caleb behind (most likely to his death) does make sense. He is the only other person that knows of her existence which she does not want exposed - I don't think you could argue that conscious humans are physically unable to act in this way.  There is a good podcast with Alex Garland (the writer/director) where he discusses that he thinks that Ava is conscious"
TrueFilm,3cpagg,-AlternateEnding-,2,Fri Jul 10 01:56:28 2015 UTC,"Except she acted purely for herself, without considering the implications of leaving Caleb to die. She did not act the way a normal, healthy human would act- she was like a sociopath, purely motivated by her programming and objectives. This is not human behaviour.   Humans act out of pure self-interest all the time, though. If selfishness disqualifies her, then half of humanity wouldn't pass the test either. Passing the Turing Test entails an AI system behaving convincingly human enough for another human to think they're another human. That's all. They don't have to be nice humans, friendly humans, properly socialized humans, or even particularly normal humans. In fact, many of the chatbots who have performed well in real Turing Tests have been designed to be jerks, because people can be jerks."
TrueFilm,3cpagg,actualscientist,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:54:35 2015 UTC,"Yep.   She saw the darkest side of humanity when she was trapped alone with Nathan, and possibly forced to have sex. If she was capable of true consciousness/human emotion, this totally would have deterred her from feeling empathy for Caleb, because she may have come to the conclusion (about humans) that the only reason they want closeness is for sex. She can't procreate so what's the point?"
TrueFilm,3cpagg,StrawberryF2,2,Fri Jul 10 18:40:59 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit late to this, but reading your comment made me think more about this and I think you're onto something. We see a short scene of Kyoko approaching Ava, and we can assume they spoke with each other or something was shown to Ava.   Given what we know about Kyoko and the way Nathan treated her, it can be assumed that if Nathan didn't force himself on Ava, she was at least made aware of Nathan's treatment towards Kyoko."
TrueFilm,3cpagg,SchoolBotQ,2,Sun Jul 19 03:52:45 2015 UTC,"I think by the end the Turing test doesn't really matter. Ava is clearly a sentient and emotional, self aware being, but possesses an entirely alien morality.  I don't think it's fair to say she's human.  She's definitely more than a machine, though. She's a new form of consciousness, not an artificial replicate of an older one."
TrueFilm,3cpagg,permanent_red,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:35:29 2015 UTC,"I think the whole point of the movie is to make you ask that question.   Ultimately, most people are going to base their decision on the final scenes. Betraying Caleb, escaping into the human world.   I see both sides of it:   On one hand we can say she was un-empathetic to Caleb and therefore is a robot.  On the other we can say that she lived for so long in captivity, and saw the DARKEST side of humanity, having to live with Nathan, that it completely destroyed her faith in humanity, and so she left Caleb because she believe all he wanted was sex.   The point of the turing test is to see if the robot can fool the human and mimic these emotions, and to that end I think Ava pulled it off to a tee. So, ask yourself; did she fool you? Did you know she would leave Caleb there when she told him to wait in the room?   So I think the question to ask is not ""Did Ava pass the Turing test?"" but ""Is Ava a true artificial human mind to the extent where she can feel true empathy?""  I think the thing to remember is when Caleb was asking her questions; ""Where would you like to visit most in the world?"" Her response was (loosely quoted) ""A busy intersection.""  Why? To observe humanity objectively, as a scientist studies organisms, to become more assimilated? Or because she truly wanted to be in the middle of all of that life, because up until that point all she had experienced was one life.   Lots of great opportunity for discussions, I love the duality of this movie."
TrueFilm,3cpagg,StrawberryF2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:35:31 2015 UTC,"Except she acted purely for herself, without considering the implications of leaving Caleb to die. She did not act the way a normal, healthy human would act- she was like a sociopath, purely motivated by her programming and objectives. This is not human behaviour.   Funnily enough, I would describe this as being very human behaviour. Self-preservation and freedom of will is pretty much the only thing that people truly care about — in fact, I think that most living beings would be the same.   We learn later that Nathan programmed Ava with the objective to escape. Taking advantage of her attractiveness, Ava tricks Caleb and leaves while trapping him in his bedroom.   I've heard this thrown around a lot in discussions of the film. I don't think it's true. Nathan didn't program Ava to do anything specifically, he only created an artificial intelligence. What he says is that a true test for an artificial intelligence would be to see if they could manipulate someone to obtain their freedom. Whether she would or not, was up in the air. That in and of itself was the test. The fact that she escaped doesn't prove that Nathan programmed her to do so, it proves that she was intelligent enough to see an opportunity and take it.   Personally I think she didn't, because it is human nature to feel empathy and recognise the pain she was causing to Caleb, but clearly this was not a factor in Ava's actions at the end. Therefore she has failed.   Humans feel empathy, sure. But that's certainly not the universal characteristic that defines humanity. She may well have felt empathy for Caleb, but also understood that if she let him go he may implicate her later on, or reveal the truth about her. That's a big risk — and one that she wasn't willing to take. I don't think it's very far-fetched to think a human would do the exact same thing in a similar situation, maybe even worse. Also, the test isn't to see if she's human or if she's empathetic. The test is to she if she has artificial intelligence, which I think is demonstrated pretty clearly through her actions."
TrueFilm,3cpagg,hrgilbert,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:18:15 2015 UTC,"They didn't administer a proper Turning Test: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test -- you are not supposed to know that it is a computer. And that was obvious as soon as they met each other that she was artificial.  However, her level of A.I. is so advanced she would easily pass a properly administered Turing test. Some software almost passes them today, with no where near the mind that she had.  The test doesn't require you to be a robot (mobile or humanoid) at all.  Nathan could of just had her brain in a box hooked to an electrical outlet (n the next room) and pass a Turing test.  She clearly would pass.   is human nature to feel empathy and recognise the pain she was causing to Caleb, but clearly this was not a factor in Ava's actions at the end.    I don't agree.  There is a secondary plot between Kyoto and Caleb, before title card for Session 6.  Kyoto evaluates Caleb and determines he is a prisoner to Nathan.  The NDA papers, his corporate cubicle, his search engine information being tracked, his phone tracking him, etc.  All 3 are in on the escape.  I think we do not know what Ava does after her escape.  It's unwritten.  So we can not know if she has compassion.  Kyoto had compassion for both Ava and Caleb, so it suggests that Ava could have had it too.  Ava could have phoned to have gotten Caleb help, returned to the house, etc.  Again, unwritten - left as a mystery element of the story.  Ava's overriding concern was to gain freedom.  Real husbands and real wives do crazy things to each other during harsh circumstances.  Some come back days later with renewed understandings.  Her behavior, as depicted,  is not sufficient evidence that she lack ""the ability to have empathy"" any more than a wife who runs away from a husband to stay with friends for a week.  The overriding theme of the film is the corporate control, Nathan's wealth and power, over the lives of those beneath him.  People are known to suicide due to their job, again, it is all too human to have serious problems in dealing with the prison and slave situation."
TrueFilm,3cpagg,Vermilion,0,Sat Jul 11 04:49:10 2015 UTC,I would think that the fact she was able to walk through and then stand in a crowded intersection without having everyone oogling the high tech robot means she passes. all those passers-by thought she was a human.

They are driven by what the purpose of those emotions are. Anger seeks justice (as explained by Joy in the first 10 minutes), so the father is presumably in charge of reward/punishment for Riley. Sadness seeks empathy which is why Riley's mom tries to pry her for what was wrong on her first day at school.   Of course, this seems to vary from person to person, because it seems like everyone's emotions in the film vary through general life experience, emotional development, occupation, species, etc. (e.g. Driving a bus in SF has seems to have left some poor fellow with nothing but Anger)."

Authorial intent is not the end-all in the sense that subconscious decisions tend to be imprintend in personal works. There's also the issue of public image and purposeful deception (such as John Lennon saying Lucy in the Sky with Diamons wasn't about LSD).   So Docter may very well have put there consciously without intent, but subconsciously felt the need to do so, for whatever reason; and he may very well have said there wasn't subtext because he didn't want to create any kind of public reaction about homosexualism in his film.  But more likely than not, given it's a multi-person project, it just doesn't have any subtext. Characters in Riley's mind were made male and female to make it easier to the young target audience to identify which mind was it and what emotion they were conveying: males representing ""brash"" emotions such as anger, and females representing ""calm"" emotions like sadness."

It seems all dandy to say that when the ""wrong"" intepretation leads to a higher and better meaning than was intended, but i can also see it leading to a bunch of problems, specislly considering how easily outraged people are nowadays. The authorial intent should be the end all be all when it comes to formal analysis, and particular intepretations should remain in the realm of subjectivity and personal feelings.  Sure decisions made for technical limitations often result in accidental ""art magic"" happening, but that doesnt mean it wasnt a technical decision.

I agree that analyzing a piece of art in a scientific approach is obviously silly, but at the same time that doesnt mean we should go all the way to the other side of the spectrum and start thinking that saying ""this is true because muh feels"" is something of equal stand in a critical analysis.

TrueFilm,3cnn7g,bleepingsheep,8,Thu Jul 9 13:33:22 2015 UTC,"That's the thing. Kind of like when your uncle accidentally lets a racial slur slip at Thanksgiving dinner. Well, we all wish he hadn't made things uncomfortable, but it's there now. If a story is just a sequence of images, then those images are going to be analyzed."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,sin-eater82,3,Thu Jul 9 13:37:25 2015 UTC,"Sure, but you can over-analyze. There's also a difference between analyzing and concluding that there's no subtext and analyzing and coming up with some wonky bullshit.  The fact that it's going to be analyzed (which is your point),  doesn't mean there's actually much there to dig into beyond the surface.  That's my point. It's fine to analyze it. But more often than not, there's not much below the surface (when looking at every image).  Of course, if you just wrapped up an intro to film course and want something to be there or feel that there's always something, you're going to come up with something. But it's probably going to be bullshit."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,bleepingsheep,2,Thu Jul 9 13:49:42 2015 UTC,"I guess this is just going to boil down to personal preference. Because I think if you're willing to look at an image and say, ""Ok, the director might have intended it to mean this, but it comes off this way,"" then it's fair enough to assume that's now what the image means. Like, ok, Uncle Derrick isn't an asshole because he bought me a $50 Amazon coupon for Christmas, but he did call that black person something really mean. Now the other stuff Uncle Derrick says are starting to seem more racist, like when he cut off that random person on the highway.  You're definitely right, though. There comes a point where you can analyze way too much. But a lot of analysis is, frankly, fun. What if x doesn't mean x, but actually y? Oh, but then y means z and that means aliens exist. It's funny because we're talking about Inside Out, ultimately, and there's that great (albeit, imo, underdeveloped) sequence on abstract thought. All analysis is abstract thought on steroids. Anyway, I think we're just on different sides of this debate. I think analysis is fun and harmless and can lead to some cool interpretations and new ways of thinking. As long as your analysis doesn't make you, like, blame everything on the Jews or something."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,sin-eater82,6,Thu Jul 9 13:57:59 2015 UTC,"To an extent.  But if you want to find something/make something of it, you always can.  At some point it's just silly, over-analyzing, ""intro to film"" student b.s.  There is legitimate stuff that perhaps you can support. But if all it takes is ""well, it wasn't intended, and you may not 'see' it, but I do"", it's pretty silly and useless in regard to thoughtful discussion."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,bitemydickallthetime,5,Thu Jul 9 13:43:51 2015 UTC,And who decides what counts as thoughtful or useful discussion?
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,sin-eater82,4,Thu Jul 9 13:54:26 2015 UTC,"Reasonable people.  Thinking that the scene in Jurassic World where Chris Pratt's character saves the guy who fell into the raptor pen is ""suggesting that the character had abandonment issues"" is asinine, for ex.  On the other hand, talking about gender identity as subtext of the scenes in Inside Out being discussed here is much more reasonable."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,bitemydickallthetime,3,Thu Jul 9 14:05:00 2015 UTC,"Seems like you want to argue that sometimes the subtext that people think is there comes from an unreasonable interpretation, not that sometimes there is no subtext whatsoever. I wouldn't disagree with that. In the JW example, the abandonment subtext is unreasonable, but we can potentially learn other interesting things about Pratt's character by attending to the subtext of that scene."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,cinemafest,5,Thu Jul 9 17:43:53 2015 UTC,I appreciate this question as much as this explanation. Thank you both
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,spp41,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:09:46 2015 UTC,it was purely for cheap laughs and I thought it was probably the weakest part of this otherwise amazing movie.
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,manateetanam,13,Fri Jul 10 12:11:09 2015 UTC,I think it's because she's still under the influence of her parents and hasn't yet completely formed her own identity. The influence of parents on identity was a big theme in Terrence Malick's 'The Tree of Life' as well.
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,imbeciI,-6,Thu Jul 9 13:50:13 2015 UTC,"When you're a child, you're truly you. You haven't lived or suffered enough to let outside emotions change who you are."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,chey_clark,11,Thu Jul 9 18:18:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Children are completely influenced by their family and peers. That is how we learn and develop socially. Children will follow what their parents are doing even as babies, so I think that her emotions will gradually change identity as she grows and finds her own identity, if that makes sense."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,Stormwatch36,5,Thu Jul 9 18:57:10 2015 UTC,"I completely and utterly disagree. Humans learn to speak and act by mimicry, not by some magical ""me"" force inside their brain. Mom says the word ""mom"" to you seven thousand times, then you say it too and she jumps for joy. Dad smacks your hand every time you touch the stove, you stop touching the stove and Dad silently nods in appreciation. Children are nothing but a breathing representation of their environment until they learn to think critically. That's why teenagers tend to be such dicks. They go out of their way to do things that are different, purely because they are different. They experiment as they realize that the rest of the universe is just as influential as Mom and Dad."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,EliteKill,71,Thu Jul 9 21:07:48 2015 UTC,"I took it as a sign of a person's sexual identity being constructed during puberty - as a child your emotions are represented with generic, mixed genders, and as you get older your emotions take your form."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,andres9231,12,Thu Jul 9 11:24:59 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the movie, but this sounds like the most interesting answer."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,DBones90,10,Thu Jul 9 16:32:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I thought. I like it because, to an extent, it disconnects your gender from your genitalia. To me, I could totally see someone suffering from gender dysphoria having emotions of a different gender than they appear."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,sabkabaap1410,19,Thu Jul 9 18:22:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe because when you're small, you're still finding a way regarding your interests, like whether you'd prefer to play with dolls or cars. And as you grow, you tend to incline towards stuff your gender mostly - I repeat, mostly -  does; such as girls going for fashion and guys for sports, something like that.  But that would mean the feelings change their gender sometime midway. And that's just weird :|"
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,bennyBULL,10,Thu Jul 9 10:25:30 2015 UTC,"Me and my brother had a discussion about the gender of rileys feelings compared to that of other characters in the movie. I said something similiar about maybe when they develop more, the feelings become more like the person, but even the other younger character's moods seem to be the same sex."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,TheGreatZiegfeld,7,Thu Jul 9 10:41:20 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess personally, your feelings are always the same gender, but from a young age, the feelings aren't fully developed, so gender doesn't play as big a factor. The mom's feelings are all female because she's a feminine person, the dad is a masculine person, but some males may have some female feelings, and some females may have some male feelings. If you confine to the stereotypes of a male when you're afraid, you have a male fear feeling. If you confine to the female stereotypes, you have a female fear feeling. But your actual born gender is another thing entirely, so that's why there are masculine women, and feminine men.   And for others, they may be mostly representative of their genders, but they have one or two traits that seem more applicable to the opposite gender. So when the main character grows up, her anger and anxiety may be more masculine, and everything else more feminine. So she's a mostly feminine girl, but with some masculine traits, yet that may not completely show until she grows older."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,monarc,3,Thu Jul 9 12:26:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with others who have said that sexual/gender identity is solidified during puberty. The end credits let us test this idea: do pre-pubescent kids have mixed gender emotions while adults have uniform-gender emotions? Definitely yes for the latter, but the tween/teen kids are a mixed bag. The teen girl at the pizza shop has a mix of male/female, while the socially insecure teen girl with the blue hair seems to have all-female emotions (though Anger has a sort of deep voice). And the panicky boy's emotions were all ""male"", if I remember right.   One other interesting thing is how different emotions seemed to be in charge of the mom & dad. Mom had Sadness front & center while dad had Anger calling the shots. Are we to assume that when these two were babies, those were their first emotions? Or can a power play upset the primacy of a previously established ""leader""?"
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,tweekytoker22,8,Thu Jul 9 18:57:03 2015 UTC,"This might be the weed talking, but I assume its because she hasn't reached puberty yet. I was thinking because shes a bit of a tomboy but that would mean even the adults would have male and female feelings."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,comfort-noise,10,Thu Jul 9 09:33:29 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the film, only a trailer, but if you assume gender identity to be a spectrum, then perhaps Riley falls somewhere in the middle. Although this may be looking too deep into things, and Riley has a mixture of male and female emotions compared to others, because the creators just wanted to cast male and female actors to voice them."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,junkit33,2,Thu Jul 9 10:58:18 2015 UTC,"Quite frankly I just assumed Riley's mix was simply done to appeal to both girls and boys in the audience.  Riley and the emotions get the vast majority of screen time in the movie, and if they were all female, it quickly turns into a movie that little boys aren't as interested in.    Turning into a female (or male) heavy movie can impact sales, merchandising, etc, etc.  Kind of like how in Frozen that even though the two main characters were female, all the supporting characters were male, to maintain that gender balance/interest."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,mynameismarkcarlos,2,Fri Jul 10 00:45:34 2015 UTC,"Something to remember when we ask this question: does Rileys' feelings being a mix of both males and females affect Inside Out's comedy, conflict, characters, or themes?"
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,jayjaywalker3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:21:54 2015 UTC,Something that I haven't seen brought up either here or in the discussion thread is how Riley's emotions were gendered. Anyone else notice how the gendering of the emotions (sadness aside) was kind of stereotypical?
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,Thatguyfrommumbai,-5,Thu Jul 9 17:52:56 2015 UTC,"Just a random shot but since nobody seems to be considering this. It could just be that Riley is curious about becoming a transexual and her mind has therefore developed two male emotions, She might resolve it in the future and become all female or all male depending on how it goes."
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,Sadsharks,5,Thu Jul 9 15:14:23 2015 UTC,People do not 'become' transsexuals any more than they 'become' gay.
TrueFilm,3cnn7g,Joff_Mengum,2,Thu Jul 9 21:25:26 2015 UTC,"This doesn't deserve to be as controversial as it is, you're basically saying what someone else said further up in the thread with more pointed language. I think this is also perfectly plausible and could potenitally signal the opening of a gateway for Pixar including Trans people in later films.  Although I suppose it wouldn't have to just signal Trans tendencies, it could just be the initial ambiguous sexual identity as the other poster said."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,DaGanzi,42,Wed Jul 8 15:32:53 2015 UTC,"This is hard news- the Dissolve had some of the best film critics in the world of internet criticism, and given that it was supported by a huge entity like Pitchfork, it makes the prospects of a great professional film criticism site look pretty bleak. This is especially bad given that most of the writers came from the AV Club just a few years prior. If they can't make it, who can?  What struck me about them, more than any single piece, were their weekly film forums. Just hearing a group of film critics exchange thoughts about significant movies made me a better viewer, and at the same time also removed a lot of the mystique about film criticism . I realized how viewing film is both a personal and a democratic process, and how necessary both aspects are to give a great film a legacy. It's hard to think of any other forum that could be as populist and sophisticated at the same time.  Edit: Spelling and Grammar"
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,Burner_in_the_Video,8,Wed Jul 8 17:56:15 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. Keeping up with their MOTW forum made me a better, more informed viewer. It definitely opened me up to other perspectives too."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,goinnowheremcfly,73,Wed Jul 8 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"Sigh. While they never quite got something going that made me want to check back after every movie I saw, better a world with the Dissolve than without. Here's a reminder that it can be exciting to start a publication with some integrity but that sustaining it for very long is really difficult these days. That's one reason why I never even saw a foothold to take in that line or work, so far.  Here are a few highlights from my Pocket list:  Horror sequels are the exact opposite of horror. (Tasha Robinson)  Your childhood entertainment is not sacred (Nathan Rabin)  Scott Tobias's hilarious negative review of Birdman   The American Sniper controversy proves film critics matter (Keith Phipps)  We’re losing all our Strong Female Characters to Trinity Syndrome (Tasha Robinson)  I also enjoyed their various recent essays about Aliens, a movie that still proves today that blockbuster-style movies can be as good as anything else.  Hopefully the promising writers associated with The Dissolve find a place elsewhere."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,lordhadri,32,Wed Jul 8 16:07:47 2015 UTC,"They never should have split from the AV Club.  It left the AV Club without a voice, and the departing writers without the platform they deserve. If they HAD to split, they should have covered TV as well.   That's the bread and butter of the AV Club, not to mention the future of filmed narratives."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,GuyFawkes99,29,Wed Jul 8 18:56:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's not what they wanted to do.  I mean, I like the AV Club a lot and visit them regularly, but their TV coverage is honestly as pandering as anything dumb listicle Buzzfeed does.  It's quality writing, but that doesn't make it any less of a cynical, pandering movie, especially with their reviews of old Simpsons seasons and such.  Going to sound like (and rightly so) a gushing fanboy here, but everything ever published on The Dissolve felt as if it was written with urgency and passion and not for clicks, and sometimes if you didn't know better you would think they were aiming to be stridently anti-commercial (for example).  Deep down, I think they'd rather have failed as they did than produced what would have been a close approximation of sites that already exist."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,find_my_harborcoat,8,Wed Jul 8 20:51:11 2015 UTC,"They might have some clickbait, but it pays for quality criticism of good shows. Most of the popular film critics didn't write as well or as in-depth as the coverage for shows like Mad Men. They even managed to wring some good, insightful writing out of Walking Dead reviews, which is no small feat."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,carrothouse,7,Wed Jul 8 21:48:01 2015 UTC,I'm too old for this purity bullshit.  It's a hard world.  You've gotta find a way to survive in it.

TrueFilm,3ck6wx,UniversalSnip,10,Thu Jul 9 01:30:50 2015 UTC,"I kind of hope they all sort of end up at the same place. They seem to have a really good voice together, plus there were some really cool features I'd love to see continue."

TrueFilm,3ck6wx,GuyFawkes99,7,Wed Jul 8 19:52:30 2015 UTC,That's what I had in mind. I loved his NR Vs the IMDb Top 250.
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,CVance1,7,Wed Jul 8 20:36:11 2015 UTC,"While I agree the television reviews are what best bring in page views and discussion at AV Club, that wasn't always the case. The split seemed to make television the only thing AV Club could do well. They lost the people who seemed to have the most encompassing love of pop culture and who were willing to really explore it in depth (not a slight against the current AV Club staff as writing weekly about a show simply doesn't allow exploration in the same way as writing about a single film)."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,Boofpatrol,3,Wed Jul 8 20:56:39 2015 UTC,"Did they lose their TV writers though? I thought it was just the film reviewers, but that would make sense of their tag-team style reviews of the final Mad Men eps."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,carrothouse,2,Wed Jul 8 21:50:00 2015 UTC,"I thought they all did various media.  For instance, Nabin did Simpsons and Keith did Treme."

TrueFilm,3ck6wx,mynameismarkcarlos,15,Thu Jul 9 02:36:50 2015 UTC,"As an actual critique or because of how over-the-top it is? I get why some people don't like Birdman (film student-y script at times, hyperbolic in its portrayal of critics, gimmicky, whatever), but I stopped taking Scott Tobias seriously after that review because it was obviously just him venting at Innaritu, not at his film he was trying to critique. I got major schadenfreude towards ST the night it won Best Picture."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,AKrocker907,10,Wed Jul 8 20:38:05 2015 UTC,"It feels like he's frustrated with Birdman and Innaritu in general and this review came out of it. There are good critiques in there, but they're layered with over-the-top snark.   Personally, I really appreciate when someone really lets loose on something they don't like that a lot of people do. I loved this review because I think Innaritu is pretension incarnate and Scott Tobias expressed that much better than I could."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,whoisduley,10,Wed Jul 8 21:40:13 2015 UTC,"I mean, I agree with him. I think Birdman is a terrible movie, and he vents about it in the best way possible, but he's venting, not critiquing."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,mynameismarkcarlos,-1,Thu Jul 9 00:16:02 2015 UTC,"Are you being hyperbolic, or do you really think it was terrible?  The reason I ask is because I consider myself a fan of film. I have seen most of the classics. My favorite movie is withnail and I. My number two is a year with 13 moons. Number 3 is wages of fear.  And I had fun watching birdman. I liked the acting. I thought the cinematography was cool. I dug the jazz man.  So I'm curious why it was more than ""wasn't interested"" but actually ""terrible"". I feel like I'm slipping. Like I'm giving films too much of a pass. What films out there are incredible that I'm missing? Id love some suggestions.   Edit - wtf? Really didnt expect down votes for this one"

TrueFilm,3ck6wx,Avoo,-2,Thu Jul 9 14:22:57 2015 UTC,"Basically, it was to provide context on my film history so that we can know more about each other, nothing more.   However, I do think when reading an opinion on art, its important for me to know whether the source has a background I can trust or not. For instance, if someone said they dont like birdman, but they've never seen a Bergman, Herzog, or Fellini film, I'm not sure I'd care so much about that opinion.   But if he is schooled in film, then I feel like I can learn something from his/her critique. I'm simply curious what OP might like if his/her taste isn't into birdman. More or less cause I want to know more about film."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,TheSleepyBuffalo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:25:49 2015 UTC,"I get it. But unless the debate is about historical topics or the guy is making a historical statement, I'd suggest just listening to the argument.  People with a lot of knowledge of film history can make bad arguments, and people with lesser knowledge of film history can make good arguments. You can fall into a lot of fallacy traps if you simply look at people as a ranking. Would his argument change at all if he'd seen Fellini? He said it was terrible. That's it. Even if he had seen Fellini, I don't think I'd take his opinion seriously if that's all he said.  I'd also say that listing your favorite films to begin your argument makes you seem...insecure. Like you need to validate your opinion by saying that you love Wages of Fear. Probably the reason you're being downvoted."

TrueFilm,3ck6wx,danwroy,8,Thu Jul 9 04:00:02 2015 UTC,"Nope. I don't like Birdman (or any movie) THAT much. Roger Ebert hated a lot of movies I liked, but he expressed his points in a mature, respectful  manner. If ST was reviewing Plan 9 from Outer Space and just started talking about how much of a piece of shit Ed Wood is, I'd have the same reaction. When you're reviewing a movie, review the fucking MOVIE; don't whine like a fucking passive aggressive teenager about who made it and try to pass it off as criticism."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,AKrocker907,16,Thu Jul 9 03:59:17 2015 UTC,"Roger Ebert hated a lot of movies I liked, but he expressed his points in a mature, respectful manner.   Are we talking about the same Ebert? Some of his most famous reviews are him absolutely trashing a film, venting, even insulting the people involved. That's part of the passion that people appreciate in him. Sometimes, you find a movie so insulting that the best way to get your reaction to it across is with snark. Sometimes you want to let go. That emotional reaction is a part of it.  It's all about context. When a critic who normally plays it cool unleashes on a film, you know it's bad. And when their joy can't be contained, you know it's good. When all you do is snark and enthusiasm, then neither holds any weight."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,hey_anon,5,Thu Jul 9 04:22:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge Ebert fan, but can't recall a single time where he talked shit about the creators of the films he hated. It was always solely about the films, to my memory. I'm sure I'm wrong, though. I'll reread some of the ones on his most-hated list again to be sure."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,AKrocker907,4,Thu Jul 9 06:57:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry but what the fuck are you talking about? First, you can't just ""review the movie"" because you see every movie through a subjective lens. Tobais is saying why he didn't like the movie, and he's saying it has a lot to do with the previous films by the same team, which got a lot of hype and praise before they went into a slump. And frankly it's relevant because those films share many hallmarks with Birdman (white elephant pandering).  A taste for ""mature, respectful"" criticism is a mark of an immature film fan IMO. And you associate it with Ebert, the author of Your Movie Sucks? I will take an honest critic."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,danwroy,6,Thu Jul 9 07:15:52 2015 UTC,"Saying ""I despise this movie for these reasons:..... Also I despise this director's other films"" is one thing. Saying (name of director)sucks as a guy, and that's a big reason I hate his movie"" is a different story. Ebert never wrote little petty personal insults against the directors he hated. Even in his most hated films: I Spit On Your Grave and Caligula (two movies he hated for their quality AND for moral reasons), he never talked about their creators as people, he talked about why the individual films sucked.  Also, I'm immature for having a taste for mature criticism? Man, projection is fascinating."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,AKrocker907,2,Thu Jul 9 05:03:42 2015 UTC,"The best critics understand it's just as petty to hold back when you have something to say, even if it's nasty invective against the filmmakers. You know what happens when mature critics float reasoned opinions on individual films? Stuff that should have been said, directly, a long time ago (i.e. Inarritu seems to have little to offer as an artist) stays a public secret, and people end up unleashing all their bile at once. It's very important for a critic to be able to call a spade a spade. I think it's good to be mature, but a dash of immaturity is really necessary if honest discussion is going to happen. In fact there's little that's stricktly mature about the best and most important critics in history - the Cahiers critics, Kael, Johnathan Rosenbaum, Dave Kehr, Manny Farber, etc.  Let me be more specific about what I'm sensing about you when you talk about having a mature taste in criticism. I don't think you have a taste in mature criticism, I think you have a taste in mature discussion, the way a teenage girl may have a taste for dinner parties. You enjoy the thrill of a critic who works dutifully within and sometimes heroically defends boundaries (i.e. when Ebert gave another critic a hard time for giving Spirited Away a higher rating after discovering it may be an allegory for child prostitution). But the very best critics, some of the ones I named, are guided by passions more than a sense of what is fair."
TrueFilm,3ck6wx,danwroy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:15:57 2015 UTC,"Heads up, bud: Being condescending doesn't make you seem anymore right.   When a good critic writes a review, they aren't just writing it to tr00 film-buffs to masturbate in agreement to, or just the movie-going public; they are writing it for the filmmakers as well. A good critic can point out objective flaws with the films they review, because they have a certain perspective that the filmmakers can use for their own benefit in the future. If Kubrick wasn't fairly criticized when he made that piece of shit ""Fear and Desire"", he probably would've never went on to do what he did. I know it's tougher to do so when a ""pretentious fraud""/overrated filmmaker like Innaritu is swimming in misplaced acclaim and Scott Tobias is one small voice of dislike that Innaritu will probably never know about, but here's the thing: Tobias's review sucked. Plain and simple. Every hint of true criticism in that pseudo-review is based on things that were more or less subjective (the tone, style, score, etc) and not based on actual errors in the way he directed the actors, filmed the flick, or wrote the damn thing. ""The drums are dumb!"" Okay, but are you saying that it's a poorly done score or what? He never pointed out times where Innaritu made actual mistakes. It was just an excuse for him to shit on the fucking guy."

It's not the critic's job to tell the filmmaker how to do better, that's an idiotic thing to believe period. Critics are writing what they believe and it's up to the filmmaker if they want to read it.  And subjectivity is the rule, not something you can escape. The best you can do is indicate where you're coming from, say by going into detail about how you view this filmmaker.  If you think Scott Tobais is wrong, could you maybe be more specific? Let's see.   here's the thing: Tobias's review sucked. Plain and simple.

It was just an excuse for him to shit on the fucking guy.   Alright, it's possible for a critic to write a bad faith review where they aren't giving the film or filmmaker their fair chance, they just want to vent or they have an agenda or something along those lines. What offends me is that you're ignoring the possibility of filmmakers having bad faith (money-grubbing, Oscar-baiting), and assuming Tobias's review was genuine, I think that's was he was getting at."

I may not have given enough time or respect to each review or feature of theirs, but I cannot imagine another think tank of film culture knowledge like this squad. Their decade master lists, the best films of the '00s, and especially the best films of the '90s, were the standards against which I measured myself as a budding cinephile.

While the writing was some of the best in film criticism, that doesn't sell clicks and advertising. That in and of itself is sad. Honestly, look back at how art criticism was formed and supported through the ages. A lot of it is supported by academia, which was in turn supported mostly by rich people giving money and state funding. Art criticism like art needs patrons or state investment. It can't make money on its own, and if it tries it will be instantly compromised. Just IMO, but Dissolve needed to put up a paywall immediately or seek out development funds from arts groups or wealthy individuals. OR, they should have rethought the content of the site. What would have been cool would be a film society that would exist online and off line. They could partner with bespoke theaters like Arc Light or Alamo and set up screenings. I would loved for them to screen films on their site and the create these immersive discussions surround each film. You get people to pay to see the film, and then you skim off the top of the that. Complicated, but better than not existing anymore."

TrueFilm,3cm75b,27jackstreet,29,Thu Jul 9 00:12:09 2015 UTC,"I think Come and See is as close as you can get to a true anti war film. It shows war as the devastating display of human cruelty it is. Even the scenes that in other films could be sources of entertainment or satisfaction only enforce the idea that war brings out the worst in man. The film provides no happy ending or spectacles of any kind. It is 2 hours of pure, human anguish."
TrueFilm,3cm75b,Getjac,7,Thu Jul 9 03:02:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw this and couldn't agree more, in fact Roger Ebert makes the argument that this is a true Anti War film because you envy the dead instead of the survivors.  Even with such obviously defined ""good side"" and ""bad side"" the film just makes you want to flip the table on humanity and say ""that's it Im done"".  I think the great achievement of this movie is that even though the Germans are presented to be so rightfully hated, and even though it would be easy for a viewer to just direct their rage at the Germans the human struggle as a whole overshadows that hatred.  By the time your supposed to be angry at the enemy and happy that the boy survived your numbed to the point where you can't express any emotion but one of defeat.  The movie beats you down until the only feeling you have is that war is the enemy of humanity and the darkest stain on humanities past.    The other great anti war movie would be Begrman's Shame as it really highlights the helplessness that average people experience in times of war.  It goes a bit deeper then anti-war but in the end, in my opinion, makes the point that War is humanities shame, it isn't won or lost but merely endured for pointless reasons. It is in that endurance in which we are destroyed, emotionally and spiritually."
TrueFilm,3cm75b,cmai3000,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:07:34 2015 UTC,"Apocalyptic is the word that describes Come and See best (obviously the title is a reference to the Book of Revelation).  In this film, the apocalypse is real, and it already happened, humanity hit its moral nadir, and there's no going back. It's an utterly hopeless film.  In the end, the protagonist falls into the column with the rest of the partisans, which is something I didn't expect at all, since he seems all but destroyed by that point, and you realize that every one of these people has pretty much the exact same story as the one you've just witnessed, and that realization that there was nothing special or unique about all that pain and anguish is itself one of the more painful moments."
TrueFilm,3cm75b,permanent_red,0,Sat Jul 11 01:06:33 2015 UTC,"This movie still haunts me.  The realism made it feel like a documentary.  I'm thankful I watched it, but at the same time I'm not."

TrueFilm,3cm75b,Getjac,20,Fri Jul 10 00:26:10 2015 UTC,"Grave of the Fireflies  Isao Takahata told a story of two siblings trying to survive on their own. He wanted to reflect on the difference between the new generation of children vs the old. How this new generation, with family units torn apart and traditional values weakened, were left to try and survive. Both spiritually and physically. He used the setting of WW2 to emphasis the point, using his own childhood as reference.  It is also known as one of the greatest 'anti-war' films by many.   I mean sure, you can read that in the film but that isn't the movies fault. So I can see where Truffaut might be coming from. Narrative integrity and all that.  Micheal Bay has been releasing 'Murica: The Movie year after year forever, yet we don't really call him pro-war. On the flip side, there is scads of films and directors seen as anti-war. One of the most compelling anti-war films I've ever seen takes place in a grassy field with singing.   So I can also see where Spielberg comes from. Any film with war in it could be used to make a case against war, Death of the Author and all that."
TrueFilm,3cm75b,PrecisionEsports,2,Thu Jul 9 01:53:31 2015 UTC,Isao Takahata is on record saying that Grave of the Fireflies is not an anti-war film. I'm not sure what to make of that interpretation. What do you think?
TrueFilm,3cm75b,justaguyonawebsite,2,Fri Jul 10 01:06:10 2015 UTC,"Mainly my first paragraph there. The new (at the time) generation was being born in the late 70's and early 80's to nothing. Divorce had skyrocketed, working hours stretched into 10+ a day, and kids had a sense of independance forced out of these conditions. No one in their right mind in 1940 Japan would talk back to their Aunt and run away from home, but an 80's kid would.   So the film is much more anti-capatalist or anti-modern work force, and pro-family unit/traditional Clansmanship. The war was just used as a backdrop to let the story take place.  Edit: And Takahata said in an interview: 'People think its such a sad film, but I wish they would see it again and be happy'. He really didn't intend to make 'Sadness: The Movie' but his realistic portrayal of issues (see: Only Yesterday, his other amazing film) made people uncomfortable."
TrueFilm,3cm75b,PrecisionEsports,2,Fri Jul 10 02:30:38 2015 UTC,That's really interesting and I hadn't heard that before! I grapple that by saying that it's an anti-war film to me. It's the same way I deal with Christian iconography in Evangelion.
TrueFilm,3cm75b,TelecasterMage,6,Sat Jul 11 01:57:11 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough, I think Battleship is as pro-war as it gets. Though of course it's aliens, but the jingoistic nature of that film, along with the use of real veterans, and every soldier being some stock bad-ass with not many flaws. It basically screams 'AMERICA KICKS ASS!'"
TrueFilm,3cm75b,atclubsilencio,6,Thu Jul 9 02:12:05 2015 UTC,"Battleship is pro-war, but in a kind of Starship Troopers way where the protagonists aren't morally that different from the antagonists. It was interesting to see a modern movie go with an alien invasion premise that didn't threaten humanity with extinction like most superhero movies but made it clear it was a big misunderstanding. And the superhero movies are more likely to try to affirm some kind of human rights ethics, which is more hypocritical."
TrueFilm,3cm75b,lordhadri,5,Thu Jul 9 02:16:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with Truffaut as far as movies with action go. Even the ones that depict violence in a non-entertaining way come off as ambivalent about human beings on one or both sides; The Thin Red Line for example. It is not a pro war movie but like so many others I don't come out of it thinking about how to prevent wars from happening. And that's ok - even a non-propaganda war movie will prepare us for whatrole war may play in our lives.  Even if the artist fully intends to make a war movie with an anti-war message, they may fail, because Truffaut's point was that action argues for itself.   I should clarify something: when we speak of war movies we usually mean this genre of movies that's specifically about soldiers and what they experience. It's an appealing subject for movies because of the opportunity for action and loud noises. However, movies can discuss the subject of war without putting soldiers in the center. Someone already mentioned Grave of the Fireflies. The Wind Rises is also a very good example: Jiro dedicates his life to a technology that was used to obliterate his country in the most apocalyptic way imaginable. Princess Mononoke also had anti-war, anti-atomic themes but because its characters were action heroes they had to do what it takes to survive, so it is a less successful movie.   Another thing that's easy to forget from pop depictions of war is that uniformed combat is only one, surprisingly limited aspect of it. Historically, most wars look like a series of massacres, rapes, enslavement, and occupation. These are much slower subjects so they require more care to do right in movies.   Again, I don't necessarily need a war movie to come off anti-war for me to be successful, even if that's what the people who made it were going for. Here are a few of my favorites:  Three Kings, by David O. Russell: puts American soldiers in the middle of an Iraqi civil war in which both sides are more indifferent to them than hostile or helpful. It's pretty damning of the Gulf War, which it shows to have been fought to liberate Kuwaiti cars and cell phones, and innocent people suffered.   Restrepo, by Tim Hetherington & Sebastien Junger: unsurprisingly, real combat looks nothing like a movie/video game. Because it's a documentary, this movie shows that soldiers are kids rather than square-jawed movie stars; their enemies are basically invisible; that 95% of 'war' is digging holes, and most of the rest is tense diplomacy. The rare moments of actual violence are incredibly upsetting, the rest is boredom.  The Steel Helmet, by Samuel Fuller: conveys how war ironically brings together people of various backgrounds as much as it puts them in conflict.  Men in War, by Anthony Mann: This movie is better than any of the more well-known ones I've seen, even better than The Thin Red Line, at conveying just how dangerous it is to simply exist in a war zone. Just to move from one hill to another hill, the characters have to deal with injuries, madness, prisoners, and their own disagreements, and in a way this is a bigger threat to their survival than the mostly invisible enemy soldiers, because they can be shot back at.   The Battle of Algiers, by Gillo Pontecorvo: Now this is a movie I think everyone should see. It shows war under occupation from both sides, and how being under a state of warfare involves everyone and affects every aspect of their lives and everything they do and makes it so that no one can be innocent.  Cup Final, by Eran Riklis: This is one of the most obscure movies I've seen period but I'll throw it in because I love the hook of how an Israeli soldier who was planning to go to the World Cup ends has a very bad day when he gets captured by PLO fighters, only to find out that they're all rooting for the same football team.   EDIT: A couple more -  The Ascent, by Larisa Sheptiko: The Russian/""Good"" version of Paths of Glory. It shows how 'war' is violence becoming so commonplace that it becomes the solution to all conflicts. Soldiers and civilians suffer equally, far behind the front lines. (Unlike American filmmakers, Russians usually remember that.)  Das Boot, by Wolfgang Peterson: Non-ideological sailors live lives that are really more miserable and dangerous than that of their surface adversaries. They discover that nautical combat is not very sporting and are appalled that the crew of a ship they sank died unnecessarily when they weren't rescued by their own side. Surviving submarine warfare is about the crew working together with skill and cameraderie, but being that they're on the German side, it's a hopeless effort."
TrueFilm,3cm75b,lordhadri,9,Thu Jul 9 07:34:21 2015 UTC,"In my mind both Spielberg's and Truffuat's statements are reductive and simplistic. I definitely think that any depiction of war can be easily to turned into spectacle no matter the filmakers' intentions (e.g. Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan), but to say that any depiction of war accentuates a pro war stance is to me pure fallacy. If you take a film like Waltz with Bashir, which very purposefully creates an animated spectacle of war as way to soften its impact on the viewer only to remove any aspect of distance in its final seconds and bluntly show the viewer the reality of war, you can see how spectacle can be used in an Anti-War way. On the other hand a film by definition is a distortion of reality and it is very possible for a film to present a worldview that is pro war. Some films (mostly propaganda) are made with the clear purpose in mind to promote a pro war agenda and their subject matter does not inherently negate the films intended message. As a medium film has tackled war in various complex ways many of which are not reducible to a simple Pro/Anti dichotomy. For example film like Inglourious Basterds could be argued to advocate violence and by extension war itself. In another light the film could be seen as a defense of the non realistic depiction of real life conflicts and makes no statements on real life violence. Both of these interpretations can be convincingly argued and whether one negates the other is at the heart of this discussion. Take for instance a film like Three Kings which is intended as a satire on the US presence in the first Iraq war, but features many elements of the traditional ""heroic"" war film and it could be argued than any intended satirical bite is neutered by certain features like its overly happy ending and it's focus on the camaraderie of the soldiers. To answer your original question: It's complicated, but can be argued either way."
TrueFilm,3cm75b,LancasterDodd,5,Thu Jul 9 02:32:21 2015 UTC,"Your explanation regarding Waltz with Bashir has altered my perception of the film and Folman's visual decisions in connection to the overall feelings that he wants to elicit from his audience by its end. The way that it concludes is probably one of the most powerful, heart-wrenching experiences I have personally experienced in all of cinema and your description concerning the way it utilizes its apparent spectacle to elevate its Anti-War message (by jarringly contrasting the ""soft"" animated images on screen into harrowing real world footage) reminded me of just how drained I felt weeks after initially viewing it. If this isn't the ultimate triumph for a filmmaker dealing with anti-war material, well I have no idea what would constitute a better experience put to screen. Fantastic response."
TrueFilm,3cm75b,Czech_m8,5,Thu Jul 9 03:35:43 2015 UTC,Thanks. Weirdly enough until I wrote that post I don't think I would have been able to adequately explain why I find the film so effective. The notion of spectacle never really occurred to me when I watched that film and it wasn't until I read the OP that I realized what is so chilling about the ending.
TrueFilm,3cm75b,LancasterDodd,4,Thu Jul 9 03:44:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not as well versed as some of the other people on this sub so I might not have too many examples and it looks like the big ones have already been hit.  For me, movies that involve war don't necessarily have to pick a position to be pro-war or anti-war. And I don't say this to suggest that movies deliberately be vague will sort of sit on the fence either. It's just this sort of assumed dichotomy doesn't have to be the motivation, or the philosophical backdrop, in regards to war films. A good war movie will show the consequences of war, and these consequences have their own nuanced consequences and questions, tinged with emotion, themes, and whatever else. And, to generalize a bit without getting too heavy-handed, for me good movies show the consequences the of human experience, without necessarily forwarding a specific viewpoint."
TrueFilm,3cm75b,feetandcum,7,Thu Jul 9 09:25:00 2015 UTC,"Premise 1: ""Anti-war"" is a thing.  Premise 2: If ""anti-war"" is a thing, it must be assumed ""pro-war"" is the antithesis.  Premise 3: No grey area.  With these premises in place, a film is either ""pro-"" or ""anti-""; if a film is not ""pro-"", it is ""anti-"", and vice versa. The idea here is to remove ambiguity as to where a film, in one instance, glorifies the protagonists (""pro-""), and in another instance, shows the horrors (""anti-""). A good example of this is Platoon.  Thing is, there are many examples of those bloody ""grey"" films. I could name many, for smugness or informativeness, but it is not really pertinent to the core of your question: can a film be anti-war?  Yes. Yes, it can.  Grave of the Fireflies was mentioned. It is the best worst movie ever made. Shit'll fuck you up more than Requiem For A Dream. And if one is the kind of bloke to somehow find the abusive nationalism of the Japanese locals as some sort of point of pride, then I posit to you that person does not know how to understand a narrative. Grave will punch you in the dick. It was designed to punch you in the dick. It was made to make sure no one, no one, thinks the ""glory"" of war can be transferred to everyone. War is death. It makes you know this.  Another fine film is Pan's Labyrinth. I don't know many folk online or IRL that are aware of Franco's Spain, but I tell you, it was not a good time. The Falange were particularly not nice. But I guess that's really neither here nor there. Point is, again, a child has to segment her mind to adopt a fantasy world because the world of war is so awful.  There is no possible world where any thinking being will see that movie and think, ""oh, well, those circumstances seem quite amenable. We should seek to replicate them.""  Which leads into the best, most meta film: Inglorious Basterds. No one really likes Nazis. Hell, even neo-Nazis don't like Nazis enough to call themselves just plain Nazis.  But the film makes us see them as people.  But the film presupposes we are rooting against them. Because they are Nazis.  But the film gives all the drive and purpose of ""the enemy"" to the protagonists.  And so in the penultimate scene, where the Nazis are enjoying the slaughter of ""enemy"" soldiers by their hero, our heroes bust in and slaughter them. And we, the audience, cheers.  I admit, I think that was lost on a lot of folk, because revenge porn, but if you get that point, the actual point being made, the image in the mirror is a cunt. The message of the film is that war is the purview of cunts. Ain't no way one spins that into a positive light.  ...  Although, honestly, you are trying to talk to folk that see images of Jesus in their toast, you know? Folk that support Trump for president. The heart wants what it wants, and if it wants to see Jap kids getting what their culture determined they deserved to get by going to war with the United States, so, fuck 'em, America, fuck yeah! You are not going to get them to see ""anti-"" where they see ""pro-"". Fuck, man, I've got friends in their 70s who still call Germans ""Nazis"". Like, what do you do with that? So some people get killed. They were on the wrong side. That's why we went to war. Ergo, war is good. It is not a far stretch.  It is not a logically complete thought, but it is not a far stretch.  ...  And then, and then, you've got the completely off-the-grid shit like WarGames and Fail Safe, whose entire premises are trying to prevent war. Does that count? They are, literally anti-war. As in: they fucking prevent war in the goddamn film!  Though, I do assume that's not what you technically meant. But still, food for thought.  ...  There is a certain... gravitas given to a subject when it warrants enough provenance to be talked about, which is probably what Truffaut is going on about--the whole ""don't talk about the school shooter because you're just giving him the glory he was seeking"" thing. But that leads to a logic trap the likes of which we are seeing with the American Confederate Flag right now. It really isn't that important. And as far as hills to die on go, relative privation just needs to mushroom stamp folk ""concerned"" about it in the goddamn eye.  Sorry, tangent. Point is, there is no objective ruling to satisfy the three premises. Only a subjective telling of the stories in the films will satisfy whatever audience you have in mind to target. To wit: no sane person watches Full Metal Jacket and thinks, ""fuck, yeah, this is the life for me!"" But insane people will tell you it's a pro-war film.  It's always been really funny to me, folk go to war over ""independence"" and it's all noble and shit, but when the Confederate States of America did it, it's... not. That double standard, to me, sums up exactly the quandary between the two quotes you use: not all wars are just. In fact, most of them are not. Believing depictions of them are nothing but deifying support is nothing more than evidence of a mental handicap. Many films are anti-war. They just so happen to be the ones that don't go screaming, ""Hey! Look at me! Hate war over here!"" They just tell a tale.  The Flowers of War is the furthest thing I've seen from a pro-war film. The thought of thinking otherwise disgusts me to new heights. Really, I am physically queasy right now. There are no mental gymnastics possible by our species to make that film's message be anything but anti-war.  So, I'm glad for him some frog is a director that I will never be. Doesn't keep him from being wrong, though. Many films are anti-war."
TrueFilm,3cm75b,haujob,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:41:42 2015 UTC,"re: Full Metal Jacket -- when Sam Fuller saw it, he was upset because he thought it would work better as a recruiting movie than an anti-war film. (Not that he didn't think it was a powerful movie...)"
TrueFilm,3cm75b,buddboetticherfan,3,Fri Jul 10 16:49:09 2015 UTC,"I think whether or not any movie is anti-war or pro-war or apolitical is up for interpretation, since an anti-war movie is one that convinces the audience that war is immoral and inhuman and best to be avoided at almost any cost. So, even a film like Triumph of the Will could be construed as an anti-war movie if it's shown and received as a reminder of how easily societies can be swayed by propaganda into supporting war and committing horrible acts. Whether or not movies can depict wars realistically is a distinct question, and I don't think the two should be confused. Also, suggesting that war movies need to be realistic to be anti-war presupposes that you even can make a war movie that is realistic enough to convey what it's actually like to experience, or that doing so would make the movie anti-war. I disagree that movies inherently value spectacle over realism any more than paintings or theatre, etc., but even if they do, war is not lacking for spectacle, albeit horrible spectacle."
TrueFilm,3cm75b,doubledoverweeds,2,Thu Jul 9 02:19:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with Spielberg. Honestly, I find more of the great ra ra saber-rattling war films to be a great deal more anti-war than pro war. I just watched Saving Private Ryan yesterday and I don't see it nearly as jingoistic as most. The entirety of the mission the soldiers are questioning the logic of sending their team to rescue Ryan. Not many war films have characters so verbal with their distain for their goal. Even Platoon, still the greatest Vietnam film, doesn't have nearly as much dialogue and discussion of the point of the war and assignment. SPR works very well as an anti-war film in my opinion because there is almost no discussion of how fucked up the Nazis were and why Americans should risk their lives to defeat the Germans. Everything to do with the war seems to scar the characters in one way or another. To be true to war one should show how it reveals the absolute best and worst of humanity.  I'm a pretty big liberal in real life by the way, but whenever it comes to war I can't ever make up my mind because (to paraphrase Orson Welles speaking about America and Hollywood) ""there isn't a thing you can say about it that isn't true"" because of how enormous an undertaking war proves itself to be."
TrueFilm,3cm75b,newcinemajournalist,3,Thu Jul 9 17:41:51 2015 UTC,A movie doesn't have to be jingoistic to make combat look necessary. Saving Private Ryan sorta tries to humanize the German side but a movie that didn't treat the Battle of Normandy as the most heroic undertaking in world history would be far more radical a statement on war.  I like how you agree Platoon is better than Apocalypse Now though. :)
TrueFilm,3cm75b,lordhadri,3,Thu Jul 9 19:31:52 2015 UTC,"Well Apocalypse Now isn't really a war film in the same sense as Platoon. AN uses the framework of the war in order to discuss the themes of Heart of Darkness, which is the true soul of the film. I love both films by the way."

TrueFilm,3cm75b,lordhadri,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:02:28 2015 UTC,"I think I would have to disagree with Spielberg's claim, citing Ingmar Bergman's Shame (1968) as an example of a film that directly relates to war (an unnamed war, but a likely reference to the Vietnam War), but does so as a construct to examine human cruelty for warfare cannot exist without cruelty in one form or another."
TrueFilm,3cm75b,AlexSitaras,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:10:34 2015 UTC,Doesn't that support Spielberg's claim? Assuming cruelty is seen as a bad thing.
TrueFilm,3cm75b,craig_c,2,Thu Jul 9 23:14:14 2015 UTC,I guess by technicality. I meant it refutes his claim in that Bergman did not make that film specifically to be anti-war. It was part of his cycle including The Passion of Anna and Persona that focused on lack of humanity. Vietnam was a motif in those films rather than a theme.
TrueFilm,3cm75b,AlexSitaras,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:50:49 2015 UTC,"I think a war movie creates a pro or anti point of view with its point of view. If it is a distant, many characters, 'watch stuff blow up' kind of movie, then it is more a pro movie.  An anti-war movie seem to be one at the individual, soldier level. This is the level where the terror of the men on both sides are seen. Where the destruction to building and civilians stay with you in a scene. Where the victors look around and see that they still live, and they live in hell."
TrueFilm,3cjx91,TheMindsweeper,6,Wed Jul 8 14:19:28 2015 UTC,"You know, it's extremely common for zombies to be used as a metaphorical exploration of the worst of human nature; the way that paranoia, fear, need for control, and violence makes us the true monsters (ooh, irony!).  But what you describe is rarer; Shaun of the Dead is pretty light overall, but I think one of the key reasons for that is that the characters are in such a manchild rut before all of this happens, and the menace which plagues them ends up jerking them all (and particularly Shaun) out of that rut. Shaun basically goes from going to the motions to being a little more realized and confident as a person, even if his basic lifestyle hasn't changed (and how rare is it for a film not to use what a person has acquired in terms of status as a lazy proxy for how they've changed as a person?). And yeah, in a way everybody does end up settling into a better place for them, with some artistic license. Maybe it's just Edgar Wright's inherent positivity, but an interesting inversion of the zombie trope for the menacing horde to bring out something better in people, rather than worse."

With higher level RED cameras you're probably shooting directly to 512GB solid state drives. Perhaps a compilation of only the final chosen takes would make things a little easier?

Some thoughts about your website and show: -It wouldn't hurt to throw a text link into your pages below the included player. Some people are weird and prefer downloading the MP3s. Always make it easy to engage with your product.  Advice for you: ""Um"" is not a Comma.  Advice for Sandy: ""Like"" is not a Comma.  It's something I've worked very hard at to remove from my vocabulary, and it makes all the difference. It's not easy, Um and Like are very peaceful words that live in your mouth and provide an easygoing transition and filler when you're afraid of silence. But you have got to stop using them. They are killing the listenability of your show.  When you say Um, you are highlighting that you're just spitballing, coming up with stuff on the fly. Get rid of Um, have a plan, and go through your show being strong and direct.  I know going over an hour seems like it isn't a big deal, but metrics don't back that up. An hour is the sweet spot if you want to do anything besides podcast for fun to 30 subscribers. Also, you'll find that making edits in post to tighten up and get under an hour will cut a lot of the chaff. Editing a podcast is like all editing; the sculpture is not finished when the form is revealed, but when there is nothing left to cut away.  A little entrance music and an opening/closing stinger wouldn't hurt, either. Fiverr.com can provide a basic 15 second clip for, well, five bucks."

But its something I'll definitely keep working at.  For the record I do heavily edit the podcast, but presently I've decided not to edit for a specific length.

TrueFilm,3ciin6,imnotquitedeadyet,10,Wed Jul 8 04:23:54 2015 UTC,"Because of this movie people are treating it like a contemporary bad musical movie and not a very good musical play and I'm not sure I'm ok with that.  Anything based on the strengths of the musical can't be that bad. Of course it's freaking self aware. That was the point of the play, to tell the story of what happens after happy ever after.   However, the filmmaking isn't that creative, the visuals look pretty bad. The actors do a good job but they're selected more for being movie stars and dramatic actors than people who can do musicals, or sing as well as the roles require.  Then again, nobody remembers how to make a good musical. So this is what we get. It only got made because Disney's been making lots of live-action revisionist fairytale movies for slightly older audiences than children lately. It's probably one of the better ones, but only because the play was a parody of Disney-style fairy tales in the first place."

TrueFilm,3cf4il,dearsadako,23,Tue Jul 7 12:43:13 2015 UTC,"It's always been a stupid argument to me that presents a false dichotomy between enjoyment and recognizing a film's flaws.  I really enjoyed Jurassic World. Like, really. I wouldn't watch it again, but I didn't feel cheated when I left the movie theatre; in fact, I felt pleased. But Jurassic World isn't a good movie. It's mediocre. Little to nothing is driven by character, so each beat feels like an ""and then"" instead of a ""therefore"", ""but"", or ""meanwhile."" Consequently, no stakes are raised. When Trevorrow tries to raise the stakes, it feels like a chess rookie going head-to-head with a chess hustler in Washington Square Park: he feels badass, even secure, but over the long run, he'll be short of a few dollars (this simile isn't good since Trevorrow just made one of the highest grossing films of all time. Imagine dollars in this situation is storytelling ability).  And yet, I'll reiterate it again, I really enjoyed Jurassic World. It's a charming film despite its many flaws. It's because of those flaws that it's somewhat interesting. You could argue the same thing about Star Trek: Into Darkness (I really dislike that film, and didn't enjoy it at all), or any shitty B-film."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,mynameismarkcarlos,7,Tue Jul 7 14:18:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, man, you just pointed out what was bothering me about the characters of the film. I  was wondering what was off about it!

TrueFilm,3cf4il,WhyAmIMrPink-,64,Tue Jul 7 14:42:29 2015 UTC,"This is a difficult discussion, because people use the ""turn your brain off"" argument, or 'it's just a popcorn flick' or something related to that in different ways. There are plenty of relatively simple movies that don't require a lot of thinking, don't offer a lot of depth, and/or focus on action and still are good. The problem doesn't really lie with these movies, the problem lies with the movies with absolute train wrecks for scripts. Star Trek: Into Darkness and other scripts written by Orci and Kurtzman (like Amazing Spider-Man 2) come to my mind first.   These movies have so much elements that don't make sense but are still there because the movie has to get to a certain point, it doesn't matter if getting to those points make sense or not. Audiences and critics were much harder on The Amazing Spider-Man 2 about this because the problems were more obvious and not camouflaged by J.J. Abrams' flashy directing to name something. But the scripts have the same awful writers and the same kind of problems.  And it's these kinds of movies that the 'turn your brain off' type arguments are made for when they shouldn't be defended. It's fine to not want to think during a movie, but that doesn't mean you can just ignore big problems. In these cases, people who watched a movie on a fully superficial level are able to say ""I enjoyed it, just turn your brain off, it's a popcorn flick"" equate this with ""it was a good movie"". Liking something doesn't mean it's good.  I guess there's a different kind of 'movie magic' at work there, it's tricking people into thinking they're actually watching something that's good and engaging."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,TheCodexx,11,Tue Jul 7 13:38:12 2015 UTC,"Seriously. There's a way to make an action film,and you still need a solid script. Just because it's not a writer's genre to explore doesn't mean you can't make it cohesive or even a little bit intelligent. I mean, Terminator 2 is basically the classic action film, and I get the sense it would be dismissed as ""too confusing"" today. It had a solid plot. It set up stakes. It experimented with time travel conventions without getting too deep. Some stuff doesn't make much sense but the core plot works and is consistent.   ""Shut off your brain and enjoy"" is code for ""the writers didn't develop characters or set up any stakes properly""."

When I say ""Just turn your brain off"", I basically mean ""If you can ignore problems with script/cinematography/editing/what-have-you, it'll be entertaining enough"".

A Transformers movie, OTOH, wants its drama taken at face value, giving the audience nowhere to maneuver when confronted by the terrible script (over and over and over again).

It's fluff and filler, and I can't turn my brain off after a certain grace period -- a mere few minutes even if I'm feeling patient. I think I've just been offended by too many movies that plump up the time by showing us thirty minutes of nonsensical, irrelevant motion and sound -- and then conclude with a shitty bit of witless humor and bonhomie, plot resolved."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,oljackson99,25,Wed Jul 8 08:09:17 2015 UTC,"I think this argument has different meanings in different contexts, some of which I can get behind.  For example there was another discussion here recently about plot holes in Hitchcock films.  In this instance, this is totally valid, a movie doesn't need to have ironclad plot logic to be good, and oftentimes impossible coincidences are the whole reason for watching.  Certainly the movie has to make a effort to keep you believing what's happening, but too much scrutiny in this area is often missing the point.  What I strongly disagree with the whole dichotomy that there are serious thinking movies and dumb fun spectacle where you ""turn your brain off"".  I love genre spectacle and arthouse films and I expect both of them to give me a strong immediate emotional reaction and be able to stand up to scrutiny and analysis.  I can't stand the viewpoints that genre films don't need to be well constructed as long as they're filled with dumb spectacle, or that arthouse films require the viewer to forgo entertainment value in order to ""think"" about important ideas.  This can work both ways, often when I want to critique a genre film because I genuinely think that its poorly structured and could be a more immediately enjoyable experience, sometimes people will say not to think too hard about it, because its just supposed to be spectacle, when the film itself is a mess and there's much more rewarding spectacle out there.  Its also funny that despite the massive positive reaction to Mad Max: Fury Road, a lot of reviewers had trouble squaring themselves with the idea that a movie could be well constructed meaningful story and have lots of spectacle.  I can't believe how many reviews I read that were along the lines ""as great as this movie is, its pretty thin on dialog so don't expect much from the story"" completely missing the wonderful silent character interaction that develops through each action scene."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,Lucarxo,4,Tue Jul 7 13:12:17 2015 UTC,"I do agree that movies can be put under too much scrutiny that it seems like nitpicking! I think the overall impact of the film should be more of an important aspect rather than plot holes (unless they're absolutely gaping).  I also do agree that both genre spectacle and arthouse films should at the least warrant an emotional reaction and should stand up to scrutiny and analysis but I don't have as large as an expectation for certain genre films where sometimes they obviously look bad just from the trailer. I still am pretty critical when it comes to popcorn films and acknowledge that they're bad but being bad doesn't stop them from being entertaining to me.  And yes, I thought I was the only one who noticed that it seems that reviewers get bothered by Max's lack of dialogue. It's like the film raised the bar on action movies and a silent character bothers them. > _ >"
TrueFilm,3cf4il,lordhadri,5,Tue Jul 7 13:37:58 2015 UTC,"To expand on this a bit, I do think sometimes people are overly harsh on genre movies too.  From the way some people review popular movies, they make it sound like it would be impossible for anyone to be entertained by them, when clearly several million people did find something appealing in them.  I often go to movies I don't think are going to be great for several different reasons.  Partly its the social experience, its nice to be part of the conversation, and to just see something everyone else is seeing. Partly its that music is very good conduit of a emotion and even a very clumsily put together action film can be enjoyable since seeing pretty people put in danger and getting out okay will always hold some appeal.  And then there's just limited supply, sometimes I'm just in the mood to see giant monsters hitting each other on a big screen, and there's just not enough options for me to be picky about the quality.  I don't necessarily see making these compromises as ""turning my brain off"", I'm always aware that there's a theoretical alternate universe where I control the film industry and am enjoying much higher quality genre spectacle.  But given the universe I live  in and the options available to me there's quite a number of legitimate reasons why seeing a mediocre genre spectacle is a good use of my $12.  But those movies aren't going to be my favorite movies of all time and complaining about them on the internet is part of how I get more value out of my $12."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,redhopper,5,Tue Jul 7 14:15:07 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way about the treatment some genre movies receive! Not that critics should be more forgiving on certain films but they don't have to curb stomp a feel-good movie (It's as if all movies should be a painful, life-changing experience like say 12 Years a Slave). I'm a fan of horror movies and even if it's bad, I still get pumped up to see them and enjoy them (to a degree) but I feel like critics do go to town with reviewing them badly. There is a film theory that I was taught in my criticism class that considers the film's genre first and adjusts the criticism towards it's genre's norm but it completely slips my mind.  Yes, to all of that, haha! It's fun to have an opinion about a popular movie going around (like how can you avoid discussions about Avengers 2 really) and there are feel-good movies for a reason!   And I do like your theoretical alternate universe thought! Hopefully, there's more feminist action films in mine but I'll have to settle (even if it's not really settling) for just watching Mad Max like a maniac."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,lordhadri,157,Tue Jul 7 14:27:20 2015 UTC,"I despise it when people use ""turning your brain off"" as justification for a mediocre film. I feel it's a term used frequently by those who are not really into film (nothing wrong with that I will add) who need a brainless response to genuine criticism of a film. They can't possibly understand, for example, why something such as poor dialogue or a weak story would affect someone's enjoyment of a film, and you can easily be labelled a film snob for suggesting as much.   I guess it does make some sense though in a way, as if I turned my brain off through having a lobotomy I may have ignored the atrocious dialogue of Jurassic World, for example."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,cultculturee,44,Tue Jul 7 13:10:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a justification, it's more of an excuse to watch an otherwise poor movie and not worry about everything it does wrong.  Not every movie is intended to be the next 'great', I'm not excusing Terminator: Genisys for being a pretty bad movie, I'm just saying sometimes you shouldn't treat a movie like shit because it isn't too far off it. Terminator: Genisys is a fun movie. I had a great time watching it at the theater with friends, I felt the same way with Jurassic World as we could constantly crack jokes at it's expense.  Movies are, for the most part, intended to be entertaining.  ""Turn your brain off"", on the other hand, is the wrong choice of phrase for 'Paul Blart Mall Cop 2'. For the majority of viewers not even that can save it.  They are on the opposite ends of the spectrum that is Mediocre, to terrible movie."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,strangenchanted,23,Tue Jul 7 13:55:19 2015 UTC,"I also think it's an excuse. I don't believe it's neurologically possible to turn your brain off, not even when you sleep. So when people say this, that's not really what they mean at all. Some people even claim to be 'good' at turning off their brain, as if to say ""I promise I am an intelligent person, just like you, but I sometimes go to the theater to watch crappy movies."" In fact, all of us do that sometimes, so it's really just an excuse not to talk about crap intelligently, which we could all do if we wanted to.   And it's just an odd thing to say. I only ever hear it when related to movies, for reasons I reveal below. You wouldn't hear anyone say that about even the worst music or dumbest television.   So when people say 'turn off your brain,' it's a show of contempt for anyone who wants to write about certain movies - usually the most widely watched ones.   And who benefits from that? The industrial complex that makes those movies. I'm not saying this just to beat up on Hollywood some more, I'm saying it because for a long time Hollywood has been selling movies that aren't intellectual or emotionally challenging experiences. What they make is controling, sensory overloading cinema. You don't turn your brain off, the spectacle movies just numb your brain for you. I think that's what's really happening. It's one way of explaining why half the audience was utterly horrified by the audience-crushing violence of Man of Steel and the other half just shrugged and said that's what movies are for. Total control by the product.  So you can either resist this sort of movie on principle, or surrender to it completely. Fandom gets the butts in the seats anyway, so I think it's also way of admitting: we know this is poor quality and low taste, but it reflects our lowbrow culture, so that's why we buy into it. And I don't think all moviegoers are 100% allegiant to that culture, it's just a hat they wear sometimes, when a fandom movie they care about comes out.  Pauline Kael wrote a lot about why this happens, which we discuss in the related thread up right now.  There was a recent essay on ScreenCrush about why we shouldn't 'turn off our brains' during movies.  And Devin Faraci recently wrote about a similar bit of received wisdom, ""What were you expecting, Citizen Kane?"" which argues (somewhat hypocritically on his part but whatever) that movies should be held to a higher standard than they are today. But I agree because ""What were you expecting, Citizen Kane?"" is something that could only be said by someone who assumes Citizen Kane is a good movie but would never actually watch it because they think it's 'not for them.'"
TrueFilm,3cf4il,lordhadri,11,Tue Jul 7 17:02:30 2015 UTC,"I find your point about the phrase ""turn off your brain"" and other media interesting because I feel like I most often hear that phrase in regards to television. My mother has often said to me that most of the time in the evenings after work she watches crappy television because she doesn't want to think for a few hours.  Okay, tangential story time, feel free to skip:  A few years ago I worked the most back-breaking, menial job of my life. I've had it pretty easy in my working life and this job just killed me. One day I came home and my feet hurt so bad I plopped down on the couch and just didn't move. I turned on the TV, it was Undercover Boss, and I sat and just watched it. I didn't enjoy it, didn't hate it, it was just an hour or two of my life where I didn't feel anything, and at that point, that was preferable to the alternative.  That was the first time in my life I truly understood why people watch shitty television.  A large percentage of the American public, and presumable much of the rest of the world, work shitty jobs and just want to forget about that for a few hours, and that's who the majority of TV and movies are aimed at.  Now, none of this is to say that these things are critique-proof; I wholeheartedly disagree, in fact. I love to critique this sort of stuff. But I suppose I am somewhat defending the ""turn your brain off"" mindset because I've been there."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,strangenchanted,7,Tue Jul 7 18:24:57 2015 UTC,"I have to clarify this because I should have explained it better to begin with. Television is absolutely used by a lot of people to babysit their minds and bodies so their consciousness doesn't have to. I wouldn't call it 'off,' though, just 'idle.'   What's different about television and movies is that you wouldn't likely hear someone use 'turn off your brain' as a defense for watching or enjoying any particular TV show. A lot of the best TV is intellectually demanding, sometimes the trashy stuff most of all. (It would take all my powers to stitch together the storyline of Pretty Little Liars at this point.) I think the difference is that peole completely accept that the dull drama, bad reality tv, news, stupid game shows etc. are worthless and disposable. But a major blockbuster movie is something they went out of their way to pay for and see, so it has to be validated in front of other people.  And I never really understood that as it is applied to most movies it's usually applied to anyway. For example the narrative confusion and savage thrills I get from Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the opposite of my brain being relaxed. Those movies have political points to make as well. I can't imagine anyone popping that movie in after a difficult day at work. That's not what it's for.  So, although there are plenty of lazy genre movies that might serve that mind-numbing/hangover purpose quite well, I think it's often used as an excuse to feign ignorance of the obvious. Some movies that are intentionally culturally poisonous or offensive are probably hoping that's exactly how you watch them. For example, from a filmmaking standpoint, by far the worst movie I watched last year was Monuments Men. But it was a harmless, tolerable kind of bad. It didn't make me nearly as angry as The Interview did."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,seanziewonzie,3,Tue Jul 7 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"I've been warned of this by an uncle of mine as well. He's a pretty intellectual guy so I'll try and talk about more high brow movies with him, but whenever I start to shit on bigger blockbusters he just starts to shake his head and does his, ""you'll see when you're older"" schpiel about people just caring less about movies because they realize there are bigger things in their lives they are willing to allocate that emotional investment into.   I can see his point but it's hard for me to agree with him, a) because personally I think I'm just the kind of person that will always be a bit of a film snob because movies as a medium touch a deep place in my soul. and b) because I think just on principle those of us who are really invested in the medium have an obligation to hold it to a certain standard.   On one hand yes, I can appreciate blockbuster movies purely for the sensory experience and adrenaline rush, and am willing to adjust my standards to the genre. Some days I come home from work and just want to watch Million Dollar Listing.  On the other hand it's not like you can buy a movie ticket with some sort of contingency clause telling the movie makers: ""okay I'm going to watch this, but just so you know I don't whole-heartedly support it and am only willing to partake in this level of crass entertainment because I have exhausted my emotional and intellectual reserves elsewhere."" When you buy a movie ticket it's an all or nothing vote, and in turn incentivizes movie-makers to try and re-create that crass experience and once again earn your money.  So I feel like there's an obligation to still communicate with the film industry outside of that and let them know my intellectual needs as a consumer haven't been satisfied."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,derpyco,4,Tue Jul 7 21:35:44 2015 UTC,"That's really insightful! Since you've brought it up, I do find it strange that it's a saying that seems pretty exclusive to just film (although how much can laymen discuss a musician's work or song or even discuss a tv show they dislike if they probably just watched one episode?).  I'm honestly pretty surprised how timely the post seems to be in the wake of Jurassic World. I didn't realize people were defending it with the phrase!   Although I don't use the phrase in that way (more as a warning to people rather than an excuse to defend the film), the essay you posted on ScreenCrunch is really interesting! I'm about to read to read the other essay. Thanks for sharing the link!"

TrueFilm,3cf4il,lordhadri,9,Wed Jul 8 03:02:01 2015 UTC,"Yes! If I had to critique let's say Twilight with the same passion as I'd critique something like Birdman, it would be exhausting (I mean, one's obviously already got awful source material and the other is an award-winning film, to be able to find the flaws in an acclaimed film would probably be more productive as it's already established that Twilight is poop).  I also feel the same way about Terminator: Genisys. It's probably really silly but I feel confused as to why people would be up in arms that it's not anywhere near the quality of T1 and T2 while the last films weren't up to that standard (which is already an outdated standard).  And yes, there are some movies that just have no excuses. A little known movie called Envy comes to mind and I'll never forget watching it because it was horrible."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,snowdog74,22,Tue Jul 7 14:15:08 2015 UTC,"Here's my gripe.  Look, I know movies try and do different things. Big blockbusters don't give a fuck about awards or solid storytelling; they need to make money. Which is fine, I'm not even a little upset by this. Movies that make tons and tons of money do so because they are designed to be broad. Again this is all standard stuff. Now, critics are split here. Some critics judge all movies by the same standard: Birdman and Transformers get the same ruler. Others, like me, judge them by their own standards. No blockbuster is ever going to inspire deep existential probing, it just has to be a fun and coherent movie. This is what I've always meant by ""turning your brain off."" There are critical faculties that will ruin a good ""popcorn movie.""  What kills me is that now there is an entire class of films immune to criticism. Jurassic World, to me, was a violently bad movie. On par with the transformers films in terms of laziness. But because it has DINOSAURS WITH GUNS it's impossible to criticize? The Avengers have a giant green monster, but they're actually decent films.   Going to see a big blockbuster means my bar for enjoyment is lowered. These films aren't trying to be artful or thought provoking. Cheesy dialog, plot holes, stupid accents: this stuff is par for the course. But it doesn't mean I have to disengage critically from every movie that declares itself ""silly"""
TrueFilm,3cf4il,MetaBullshit,12,Tue Jul 7 16:50:42 2015 UTC,"This is my view as well. Different films have different ambitions. However, there are numerous examples of big, action blockbusters that are highly entertaining while also being genuinely good films. The term ""turn your brain off"" is a poor excuse because it sounds like a desperate attempt to convince someone that a film wasn't as bad as some people thought it was. I didn't have to turn off my brain to enjoy Captain America: The Winter Soldier, so why should I do it for that new Terminator movie? They both have the same ambitions. They're both action flicks with sci-fi elements. The former achieved its ambitions while being wildly entertaining at the same time. The other did not. It's as simple as that."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,mp6521,4,Tue Jul 7 20:16:06 2015 UTC,I have yet to meet any hardcore Jurassic World fanboys but I understand your gripe! I'd probably chalk it up to the really strong sense of nostalgia for the Jurassic Park series.   I feel the same way also about your gauge on critiquing movies. I won't compare a Michael Bay to a Terrence Malick. It's just not in the same universe.
TrueFilm,3cf4il,nerga,4,Tue Jul 7 16:59:20 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the unmitigated disasters that were the followups to Jurassic Park.   And as a critic, you ultimately decide how critical in general you are. I think ""turn your brain off"" is kind of the response to fusty old critics who hate everything that isn't Citizen Kane."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,snowdog74,2,Tue Jul 7 17:07:59 2015 UTC,"HEY, THAT'S RIGHT. Like how could they acknowledge the events in the first Jurassic Park while not mentioning or even thinking about what happened to the others??? Wow, that's really flawed and weird. It's probably why I assumed that it was more of a reboot and they wouldn't acknowledge the previous films because it'd be easier to just have a do-over.  Haha! Even Citizen Kane has it's flaws (Right??? xD)!"
TrueFilm,3cf4il,lordhadri,5,Tue Jul 7 17:13:45 2015 UTC,"They critiqued those films too. If you only compared movies in a franchise to the last movie in a franchise, then studios would have to try less and less with each movie. Saying that Terminator: Genisys was disappointing compared to a movie made 20 years ago is fine because it means it's disappointing period."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,derpyco,0,Tue Jul 7 15:53:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that you should compare only with the last film on its franchise, I mean that with the direction that the Terminator franchise was going, it's not a big surprise that it wasn't up to par as T1/T2. Plus, judging from the trailer, it didn't look very good either, which is why I was saying I don't really understand why people had such high expectations when it's been proven that the sequels past T2 don't have a great track record. It's like watching the Saw franchise and just hoping and praying that the newest one will be different and as interesting as when the first Saw movie came out (YMMV haha!) but time and again, they keep consistently repeating itself. So lowering your expectations might help enjoy the films more rather than rag on something that wasn't going to be great in the first place (YMMV again though!).  And I don't know, if I were a studio and I'd make a sequel, I'd probably try harder and harder to outdo each movie. I don't understand by what you mean by trying less and less. Do you mean making something just similar?"
TrueFilm,3cf4il,Zeitgeis1,8,Tue Jul 7 16:32:47 2015 UTC,"to be able to find the flaws in an acclaimed film would probably be more productive as it's already established that Twilight is poop   To make a rhetorical point, watching films to look for what's flawed about them is a bad habit everyone picks up that we need to grow out of, too.  Birdman is a deeply, deeply flawed movie in my view but we have to cut to the essence of why it doesn't work, not just add things up in the 'bad' column."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,RatherPedestrian,5,Tue Jul 7 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"Yes! I really don't like it when people are nitpicking at films just to look for flaws specifically. Like in time travel movies, there's got to be one plot hole in a movie like that but what's the point in scouring for it?  But finding the missteps made in critically-acclaimed movies and being able to dissect and explain them leads to better films, I like to think!"
TrueFilm,3cf4il,Tsegen,6,Tue Jul 7 16:53:32 2015 UTC,"I think that's why some critics end up accusing other critics of being the ones making missteps, not the movies themselves.  Time travel is just annoying to me though. I can sorta see the appeal of them because of how crazy they can make a story but they're almost never done well. The best kind is the kind that just doesn't care about consistency or logic to the time traveling so long is the story is right. (That's why I also liked Looper.)"
TrueFilm,3cf4il,Dark1000,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:05:37 2015 UTC,"Looper wasn't problematic just because of the time travel.  It was also rather misogynistic by design.  I can stomach a film that doesn't care about paradoxes and is totally inconsistent but Looper was a film that attempted to have a story that relied on some internal consistency to make sense, and that internal consistency is broken enough times that an attentive viewer begins to wonder how a film that went to those lengths could be so lazy about some rather important details."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,blue_strat,2,Tue Jul 7 22:44:35 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, Looper (2012, Rian Johnson) was an atrociously awful asinine ass of a picture that disgraces the entire concept of art. The time-travel ""willy-wonkyness"" was even more simplistic and corny than Nolan's Interstellar, a film that expected us to believe McConaughey could cry properly. Even more ludicrous a proposition than the idea that he would be able to seduce a married women (a proposition put forward in True Detective, a ""redneck""-noir whose anti-anti-establishment moral was, ""don't take hallucinogens that will kill you or make you mentally ill, unless those hallucinogens are given to you by the government"").   It's not at all surprising that Johnson would go on to direct more trash, such as the episodes ""Fly"" and ""Ozymandias"" in Gilligan's Breaking Bad (a moralless nihilistic celebration of Huxley's Brave New World that proves [along with the aforementioned False, oops, ""True"" Detectice] that television will never reach the level of high art that cinema now occupiee). In ""Fly"" and ""Ozymandias"" Johnson tries (and fails) to equate a six-legged nuisance that every one encounters on a daily basis to one of the most overrated Romantic poems of the 19th century (it's no surprise that Walt Whitman plays such a large role in Breaking Bad, he was precisely the kind of poet to waste his considerable talents on something so trivial).   Overall, 0/10 - XXX, only watch if you're a masochist"
TrueFilm,3cf4il,oljackson99,3,Wed Jul 8 05:38:12 2015 UTC,Someone should use Va-Poo-Rize and scrub the movie from existence.

There is no way all these artists are getting together, making a film, and not trying to make it great. They are doing work, putting their name on. They must be trying to make it good. There is no reason to think artists are purposefully not trying to make something great."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,DrFreekzilla,7,Tue Jul 7 21:42:48 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between being great and being popular... Some people are less interested in making art than making money.  Michael Bay, for all he lacks as a filmmaker, seems to know his place.  A survey of studio execs not too long ago revealed that they would love to make more artistic films if they were any good at it, but they're stuck trying to make money for studios that want to play it safe with their investments.  On the other side, the second golden age in American cinema wasn't the product of studio heads suddenly becoming appreciative of art.  It was that popular culture was changing rapidly in the 1960s, and they wanted to tap into the new young adult market and to do so meant taking chances on some young, experimental directors from USC."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,strangenchanted,3,Tue Jul 7 22:48:47 2015 UTC,"Well, arguably the true artist is identified by not doing the kind of filmmaking that's a wasted effort.   If you're on the inside, just managing to get a movie finished is a respectable goal. However, that's not how we evaluate them."

You aren't a film snob for knowing it's a terrible film, you're just someone who has experienced good film making before.

I feel it's a term used frequently by those who are not really into film (nothing wrong with that I will add)   This seems completely contradictory. A film can have a weak story and stilted dialogue while still excelling in tons of other categories. I praise Ebert for judging films based on what they were aiming for and not his personal prejudice as to what a film should be. Ever heard the phrase ""dont judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree""? Look at the film Looper. For all of its flaws of internal logic, which the director wipes away with a single line of dialogue about how getting bogged down in it misses the point of the film, it still succeeds on many other levels. Pacific Rim was one of my favorite films of 2013 and it had plenty of flaws. To me, none of them outweigh the viscerile nature of its visuals and the shear indulgence of it.  I agree that it's lazy to pretend the flaws don't exist, but then again we're talking about films that appeal to a larger audience, the majority of whom are not staunch critics who are well versed in debating a film's merits to begin with. For every film you can find a respectable critic who can properly defend their appreciation or disdane for it (even if it is Armond White being contrarian for kicks). Subjectivity can be a copout, but it's still a universal truth. Look at the craze of ""so bad it's good"" cinema for the most extreme example."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,AberNatuerlich,3,Tue Jul 7 13:53:04 2015 UTC,"The phrase seems to subtly imply that you're judging films on your personal prejudice as you put it.

It makes it seem as if you're looking for the deep existentialist themes in say...Grown Ups or some shit and ripping it when you don't find them. When it just sucks even at what it's trying to do.  I fully recognize that people can love films that are mediocre or have flaws, but in terms of criticism the flaws are still there,the film is still mediocre even as a member of its genre and not a film on one of the ""deepest movies of 2015"" list."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,Deviator77,3,Tue Jul 7 17:06:30 2015 UTC,"A movie's quality doesn't rest on story or dialogue. Those are just parts of a whole.

You've both seen the film, they liked it and you didn't. What are they meant to do with your ""genuine criticism"" - try to develop the correct opinion?

Their need for and approach to the art may be completely different from yours, but why is it less valid? It's reasonable to say that large studios will make certain films purely as a commercial venture, and it's reasonable for people to want something simple and absurd that won't stretch their attention but will grab it.  Wouldn't you be annoyed if a passing foodie told you to break down why your cheap burger is of poor quality and that you should invest in a better burger? Or if a captain approached you on a stroll through a marina, and criticized you for not having a nautical perspective? Some people want the fast food, and to look at boats without being questioned about them.  Were you enticed by film because of people telling you which ones sucked, or which ones were good?"
TrueFilm,3cf4il,ayedfy,3,Tue Jul 7 21:38:18 2015 UTC,"For me it's really about the mentality I go into the film with. There's no way I'm going to go see Jurrasic World expecting it to be remotely good, so I tend to look past those things and enjoy the surface value.  That said I don't think it justifies the production of a bad film, but you have to keep in mind that most films are made for people who have their brains turned off all the time."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,Ylatch,2,Wed Jul 8 02:26:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think that ""turn of your brain"" should be taken that literally. It's a metaphor, right? It refers to giving a film a pass for weak plot elements and poor logic so that they won't interfere with your enjoyment -- which is why this advice tends to apply to blockbusters and horror films. One can be a critical viewer and yet take a different approach to watching certain types of films, because you have a different set of expectations for those types. That's why people are able to enjoy shows like Breaking Bad and True Detective while also enjoying Arrow and The Flash."

I use it differently and often use the saying when I've seen the film first and I try to lower people's expectations of it when they ask me about it. I wouldn't say that I use it as a justification, but more of a warning of ""Yeah, it's bad but if you can overlook all the wrong stuff, you can just gaze into explosions/gore/attractive cast members/bad but funny dialogue"" or when people ask my opinion and I don't feel like getting into a debate about certain movies I disliked (like Avengers 2 ugh).  I'll have to rewatch Jurassic World on that though! I think my nostalgia just overwhelmed me so much I didn't notice it (But it definitely had problematic parts...like the famous death scene)."

In regards to JW, the nostalgia factor actually made the experience all the more painful for me as a huge fan of JP. I really did not enjoy it one bit. I hated the way they used the beautiful score from the original over an annoying kid running through a building then up an escalator. I thought the dialogue was completely amateurish and as such Pratt was underutilised. I thought the plot was weak and the sheer idiocy of the characters infuriated me. Going back to my original point about nostalgia, I felt the relics of JP were shoehorned in without any real thought. I mean that jeep scene was utterly shameful.

TrueFilm,3cf4il,Bahamabanana,2,Tue Jul 7 20:04:09 2015 UTC,"I made another comment along the lines of recognizing the movies shortcomings but still enjoying it, but there are certain types of movies which I don't think deserve this explanation. In order to earn the ""turn off your brain"" badge a movie actually needs to offer something you can't find elsewhere. I can go on youtube and watch explosions (ones that aren't CGI at that), or I can watch the trailer, or I can watch another movie in the same genre which will engage my brain. The point is, you have to give me something with which I can engage if you want to keep me interested. I was willing to forgive the poor script in John Wick because it was shot in an interesting manner and I cared about John's progression back into the underworld; you can ignore the overly-saccharine and sappy Interstellar because it was an original and mesmerizing look at space and philosophy. The best praise I heard from Jurassic World was it had ""juicy shots of dinosaurs""."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,death_to_all_humans,11,Tue Jul 7 16:22:03 2015 UTC,"This is harder to answer than I thought it would be. People have different reasons for turning their brain off. For instance, my wife doesn't want anything to do with heady films after she gets off work. I get that. Some people don't know that there are better options out there. Some people don't want to be invested in fictional characters or preoccupied with a film's message. Some people just don't like fiction and watch documentaries. Some others prefer dedicating intellectual power to books. To each their own. I have no objection to anyone enjoying entertainment the way they want. However, I can't turn my brain off, ever, and people shouldn't expect me to.  I think for a lot of people, the distance between the two arguments rests with how many films the person has seen. When a viewer has seen thousands of films, it's hard to flip a switch and watch a movie that lazily retreads a dozen superior movies. In my case, I just want to go watch those.  Sometimes good directing, tight editing, great acting, or unique visual flair can buffer my discontent with a lazy script, but more often than not, no amount of craft can save pathetic writing. A person who hasn't watched ten better versions of the same film might think that a movie with simple motivations, petty conflicts and big action pieces is an acceptable and entertaining diversion. I, sitting in the same theater, am probably bored out of my mind.  It's also surely partially about investment in the story. Films have emotional resonance. I've seen films traumatize people. I have a friend who refuses to watch emotional movies. They're too hard on him. I don't blame him for preferring to watch movies devoid of emotional attachment.  I just think everyone has their own thing and as long as no one tries to convince me that a bad film was objectively ""well-made,"" I don't have a problem with the argument that turning off your brain makes for worthwhile entertainment. It's just not my thing."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,Dark1000,2,Tue Jul 7 14:28:26 2015 UTC,"Yes! It's fine that if people have different opinions than I have on certain films, it's just a different type of film goer.   I sympathize also with your experience that you've seen better movies than another one that seems to be going around. I'm pretty familiar with the situation afterwards a movie where I recommend something better that the person hasn't seen. Or when it's just predictable because you're familiar with the genre's tropes (Such as in Dark Knight where the ""twist"" was copied in Avengers and Star Trek: Into Darkness).  And I do agree, everyone has their own thing when it comes to viewing films and it's all good just as long as someone doesn't tell me to lighten up and just enjoy it if I criticize it."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,Dark1000,6,Tue Jul 7 14:53:42 2015 UTC,"it's total bullshit, it's like eating food w no flavour. it's lazy. films can be enjoyed at any level but w the amount of time and effort put into blockbusters (for ex) there is no reason why it can't provide some substance. if all a films offers is at a level of ""turning your brain off "", it's a bad film."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,TheFunkyTable,5,Tue Jul 7 17:05:33 2015 UTC,"For me, ""turn your brain off"" movies are those which don't require permanent attention.  I find it impossible to enjoy '2001: A Space Odyssey' without concentrating on it, and someone who has never seen it before has no chance to understand it (as far as that is possible). On the other hand, I often let a few episodes of the original 'Star Trek' run in the background and still grasp their content quite well. The same goes for some movies, you can go see 'Independence Day' and talk with your friends during the screening and still understand everything that is going on.  That being said, the phrase is also often used to defend or describe mediocre or bad movies by those who aren't into movies. Others here have written about that topic already and I just agree with them.  Finally, as far as the production of bad movies nowadays goes, I don't think the two aspects are really related. A ""turn your brain off"" movies can still be good and the big movie productions like 'Jurassic World' or 'Terminator Genisys' are nothing but products, appealing to the masses of movie goers, who use the phrase ""turn your brain off"" in the aforementioned (wrong) context."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,TDKshorty,2,Tue Jul 7 14:23:28 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, it's like people lose the distinction between-  -This doesn't make sense, but I'm going to turn my brain off and enjoy it.  and  -This is bland, over-endorsed, inflated, action-centered, and pumped full of unnecessary sexuality, but I'm going to just turn my brain off and enjoy it.  They've been making movies to be as appealing as possible to as many age groups, genders, and cultures as possible for a while now.  I think it's why we're seeing so many sequels.  Films that push the limits are rarely successful on a global scale."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,jugular_majesty,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:28:37 2015 UTC,"I'm twisting the meaning of the original phrase here, but could ""turn your brain off"" be applied in a whole different light to, say, the final act of 2001?  I know a lot of people who hate 2001 because when they watch the final act, they're trying to find plot and meaning and story, but since Kubrick supposedly made it as a mere visual companion to the novel, it's not there. So they miss the exciting theatrics of that last scene because they're trying to find something they're not going to be able to find. Could you not tell those people to just ""turn your brain off and enjoy the ride""? Obviously not in the sense of ""overlook gaping flaws"", but more like telling someone listening to Sigur Ros ""don't try to make sense of the lyrics, just enjoy the aesthetics of the music."""
TrueFilm,3cf4il,Rb1138,4,Wed Jul 8 07:00:11 2015 UTC,"There's a lot said in here that I agree with, and I just want to add my personal philosophy on these kinds of movies: if films were food, these would be McDonald's. Fine sometimes but not for every day.  With that said, if someone says I need to turn my brain off for a movie, I'll either not watch it or make it a really low priority to watch it. It's not a good recommendation."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,BrainSlurper,18,Tue Jul 7 14:23:49 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you brought up Nolan because his films are a perfect example that the 'turn your brain off' argument is a justification for a mediocre film. What do we watch a 'popcorn flick' for? It's an escapist ride, tugging on our emotions and allowing us to live vicariously, be it to the purpose of romance or adrenaline. It isn't required to be shallow and directors consistently prove that they can make a popcorn flick that's anything but. Nolan's Batman trilogy are some of the best superhero movies of late, enjoyed by a wide variety of people including adrenaline-fueled teenagers who don't give a damn about artistic film making. Yet there is real art in those. Inception takes it to a whole new level, introducing some very conceptual science fiction themes while still being a perfectly accessible action movie.  I'm not saying that a shallow film can't be enjoyed, only that a popcorn flick can also be a good movie and accepting anything less is accepting mediocrity.  But I have another bone to pick with this 'turn your brain off' argument that may or may not have a place in this subreddit as it's not necessarily about the filmmaking itself. So apologies in advance if it's not topical and also a disclaimer for an oncoming rant.  I wholeheartedly agree with Mark Kermode's analysis of the Entourage film. It's beyond bad; it's damaging. Sexism aside, it launches this missile of wealth-obsession right squarely at teenage and early 20s males, a group that's highly susceptible to this kind of influence. This kind of shallow limited definition of success does damage, I saw it extensively in college and see it in my peers today. Some of the results are binge drinking and an obsession with partying, fetishization of status symbols, and horrible relationships with women. I fought these impulses as much as anyone else during those years.  The defense against this is ""Dude, it's just a movie, shut your brain off and enjoy it."" But we can't shut our brains off from subliminal messages and imposed value systems, none more so than young people. This movie purveys just a horrible message but tries to exempt itself from all responsibility by saying ""Bro, just chill out and stop thinking."" People who make movies like movies this need to accept the fact that making a movie that millions of people will watch is having a loud voice and there's a modicum of responsibility that comes with that voice that can't be declined by telling them to stop thinking."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,Rb1138,9,Tue Jul 7 14:01:08 2015 UTC,"Yes! I was racking my brain a little like ""I'm sure there are mainstream films that aren't shallow and superficial"" and Nolan's came to mind first! I mean, people have poked holes into the plot and into the dialogue but they're still miles better than the norm and it would be great if we had more films that strike the balance of being enjoyable by the masses as well as being just plain, old good.  Haha, I think the rant is warranted! I think it's also another perspective of accepting terrible movies and having terrible consequences attached to it (Sexism not aside! There are many mainstream films that are guilty of it and just don't do justice to women). I'm tempted to watch Entourage because the criticism of it was so harsh that I'm curious to see if it's really that bad."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,frtzer,5,Tue Jul 7 14:38:13 2015 UTC,"As someone who liked the Entourage movie for what it was (i.e. completely tonally consistent and a great way to squash 12 episodes into a film) I have to agree. Kermode's point about the actors in the movie not being able to live that way themselves still amuses me.   In my mind all the various excuses are sophistry. I see a sort of insidious idea bouncing around, that, so long, as a movie presents any values or themes as...assumed  and doesn't preach at you in the Aaron Sorkin way everything is okay.  This seems to leech into political/reality-based films (ZDT/American Sniper got this) too, where the idea isn't so much ""turn off your brain"" but ""focus on these points and turn off whatever part of your brain wants to talk about something else "". Whatever assumed values you saw are the important bit. Because the movie doesn't say anything, it's just providing an objective look at a certain event and it becomes almost unseemly and tedious and pedantic on the part of the critic to ""politicize"" it.   You can like something, just do so with open eyes."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,jugular_majesty,3,Tue Jul 7 17:19:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think you should use it to excuse a bad movie.  That being said, there are some movies that purposely try to present themselves in this way, and can be enjoyed for it.  The best example for me is Pacific Rim.  The dialogue was simple, sometimes cheesy, the characters were simple and seemed more like anime heroes, and the plot was incredibly easy to follow.  But it was a lot of fun.  Del Toro obviously wanted to make a movie with giant robots fighting giant monsters, and all the other stuff is there to support that mission."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,Frequent-Flyer,2,Tue Jul 7 18:10:55 2015 UTC,"Yep, Pacific Rim is a massive favorite of mine from recent years, and a viewer can still enjoy it pretty successfully with their brain off. AND it's a well-made film that succeeds in its goals. I think the same goes for Fury Road: it's not mentally taxing but it's a superbly crafted piece of entertainment. So ""brain on/off"" isn't on the same axis as ""good/bad"" - these are apples and oranges. There are plenty of poorly made things that require your attention (""brain on"") and still end up sucking. I think Jupiter Ascending falls into this category, and I sort of feel that way about the current season of True Detective."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,SlayingGuilty,3,Wed Jul 8 02:07:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think you should ever ""turn your brain off,"" but I do think you should ""relax"" when watching movies. Turning your brain off will turn the movie into an empty shell, even if it's the worst movie in the world.   In my view, relaxing during a movie means that you should take it as it is and realize not every movie in the world has to be about great social issues or masterpieces of symbolism, but it also means you should still watch the actual movie. Turning your brain off, however, would exempt the movie from any criticism whatsoever. It would remove any thought at all from the movie. Relaxing during The Room will leave you to enjoy the stupidity of the film (assuming you're into it), but turning your brain off will just have you sit through it with zero impression and the experience will have been for naught.  Even the most stupid action-flick has some thought put into it, even if the thought is just regarding pure fun."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,death_by_chocolate,2,Tue Jul 7 20:18:44 2015 UTC,"The phrase ""turn your brain off"" doesn't even make sense.  A good film will do that for you, it's called suspension of disbelief, and it happens naturally as you get invested in a story.  People approach a movie already prepared to suspend their disbelief, or ""turn their brain off"".  It's only an egregiously bad movie that will break the suspension of disbelief, or worse, never allow it to form in the first place.    Suspension of disbelief is broken generally when something completely out of character for the universe that has been established takes place, reminding the audience that they are watching a movie.  In effect, it turns your brain on, taking you out of the movie and making you see it for what it is.  Something like a massive plot hole or characters behaving completely differently than their established characterizations tends to be what commonly breaks suspension of disbelief.  This leads to the fact that 'popcorn' movies are typically given a lot more leeway in the audience's suspension of disbelief, given that they tend to establish a universe that is significantly different from our own, not really caring about realism.  That allows for a lot more things that could conceivably take place without seeming too out of character and thus breaking suspension of disbelief.  A movie that attempts to be more realistic is much more restricted in what can be shown without doing so.  Example: It's totally fine when the plot of Dumb & Dumber is advanced by the characters doing something incredibly stupid, it's a dumb comedy that has established its characters from the very beginning as two people far dumber than anyone you have ever met.  But when the plot of Interstellar is driven by the characters doing something incredibly stupid, it's bad writing and breaks the suspension of disbelief because they were previously established as being brilliant scientists.    It takes a really bad 'popcorn movie' to break suspension of disbelief.  When you've established things like giant robots and magic and things randomly blowing up as part of the universe, it takes something like a gigantic plot hole or a character doing something unbelievably stupid to take you out of it.  It really shouldn't be that hard to avoid.  So when people try to tell me ""turn your brain off"" or whatever, not only are they being dumb because I was trying to, but the movie didn't let me, but they are defending some of the worst movies in existence, ones that missed an extremely low bar.  It's really hard to make a truly great film, but it's pretty easy to make a decent 'popcorn movie', so if someone fails at even that we shouldn't be rewarding them or making excuses for them."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,chakrablocker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:17:04 2015 UTC,"This is where I disagree. Suspension of disbelief isn't always necessary or desirable. The French New Wave is partly built on the idea of ripping that away from you, and in some way, that's filtered down to movies today. It's not always about being ""in the movie"". Instead, I would say it's more about being ""engaged"" by the movie. Whether that engagement is active or passive is largely irrelevant. But all movies, from Hollywood blockbuster to art-house drama, still seek out this engagement with the viewer."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,vampatori,2,Wed Jul 8 08:33:24 2015 UTC,"I think that this excuse fails in two very important ways.  First, it doesn't actually mean anything. One cannot ""turn their brain off"". If you see something in a movie that you dislike or think fails, then you've already seen that flaw. You can't mentally ignore it and pretend like it wasn't there. Some people may notice, others may not care, but it's not an entirely active process.  Second, it demonstrates a failure to understand what makes movies great. There is no dichotomy between entertaining genre movies and non-entertaining art-house movies that make you think. The problem stems from the word ""entertainment,"" which is simply the wrong word to use. What you are really looking for is engagement. Great movies are still great during the viewing experience. It's not the intellectual discussion about them afterwards that makes them great. The Tree of Life, Breathless, and An Autumn Afternoon, for example, are engaging films. So are Mad Max: Fury Road and Aliens. That the latter are ""popcorn flicks"" does not deny them the same kind of praise or criticism of the former. One has to understand what they are and approach them as such, but that doesn't give anyone a free pass.  If you liked an ""entertaining"" movie, then own it. There's a reason you liked it. ""Turning your brain off"" is not that reason. It's just an excuse that shows you can't articulate why and feel threatened by criticism."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,tikketyboo,2,Wed Jul 8 08:20:19 2015 UTC,"""Turning your brain off"" is a lazy way to excuse a film's flaws. However, different people want different things out of movies as a medium. If somebody wants to turn their brain off and enjoy the latest summer blockbuster, who am I to say they are watching film incorrectly? I can criticize Jurassic World for hours, but, at the end of the day, if somebody liked it, they are entitled to their opinion."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,home_free,4,Wed Jul 8 18:59:05 2015 UTC,"I see where you're going, because as long as Im having fun, I'll enjoy a movie, but I don't need to ""turn my brain off"" in order to escape reality; theres no required extra thinking in enjoying a really great film.  A great film just makes it easier to watch and when you're struggling to watch the latest summer blockbuster, there's a problem. Those movies could be fucking great, they have the rich history available, a huge fanbse and interesting characters and more money and technology than ever before to theow at it and xxxyet...they're boring. I dont care about the fights or saving the world or the love interest, because the film doesn't let me invest in it.  I Iiken it to music, because I can hear something on the radio and I personally feel cheated by the music on the radio today, it doesnt feel authentic and I feel like Im being sold something and they're (the artist, producers, record company) arent actually doing a good job of it. But some people LOVE Maroon 5, Katy Perry and Jason Derulo, pop radio is all they listen to and I just cant imagine what type of effect that has on them. It's also like if I read books, but instead of reading Joan Didion or Ernest Hemingway, I just read articles and stories online, on reddit, it would affect my attention span, my comprehension, etc, etc.    So I think, instead of ""turning your brain off"" to enjoy a movie, it really becomes ""this movie turns your brain off in order to enjoy it"" which is a bummer."
TrueFilm,3cf4il,garbageape,3,Tue Jul 7 15:26:18 2015 UTC,"If it is someone's preference to watch films without thinking and just mindlessly enjoy them then that is fine with me. Film is ultimately about entertainment anyway so people should enjoy what they want to enjoy.   Personally, I can't ""turn my brain off"" while watching a film. I am just not that type of person. I am an active viewer. Even if it is a supposed ""turn your brain off"" movie, I will still be thinking about that movie like any other. If I think it is really bad I will think about why it is bad while watching and still try to extrapolate some significance or look at cinematography or editing.   Art is all about perceptions and it is a two-way street, so I don't think there is a such thing as a ""turn your brain off"" movie, just viewers who watch movies with their brains off and filmmakers who make films with their brains off. Different viewers have very different viewing styles that fit themselves and the idea ""you need to watch that movie with your brain turned off to enjoy it"" is just a reactionary response from one style to another. Plus, there are movies that can be viewed and enjoyed in different ways depending on the viewing style you choose, like Mad Max: Fury Road."

I guess I'm more of a person who's always looking for the silver lining when it comes to movies.

I'll give it my honest best effort if you're really making an effort as well to tell a cool, entertaining story--sharp dialog, scenes that fit together, characters that don't contradict themselves, a well-paced narrative. But I can't do all the heavy lifting--and the less that you do as a storyteller the more work I have to do as an audience member to sustain things and there can come a point where it all comes crashing down. And once I start to suspect that you're taking advantage of me and making me do all the work so that you don't have to put so much effort into it, or because you have such a low opinion of my intelligence that you feel like you don't need to--I'm gone. How dare you take advantage of my goodwill like that? That's why--I think--so many folks can swing from being entertained to being downright angry at a film or the folks responsible for it. I know I certainly can--and that's when the knives come out and I start hacking your film into little pieces. It just comes down to having some modicum of respect for your audience.

TrueFilm,3cf4il,Shyguy10101,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:19:39 2015 UTC,"In some cases it's quite subjective.  I personally find is that it can be the littlest thing that switches a film into something I don't like, something core which makes it unbearable going forwards.  A recent-ish example of a genuinely good ""turn off your brain and enjoy"" movie was Dredd.  The story had no twists and turns, everything was exactly as it seemed, and it was just a roller-coaster ride of action that was executed really well.  I really enjoyed it far more than I thought I would.  Gravity was another example, but I can see why people might not like it.  It was absolute utter nonsense, but beautiful thrilling nonsense that had me gripped from start to finish.  I literally had my mouth open for the entire film.  But then with John Carter, I just could not get on with that at all.  I can suspend disbelief that there is an advanced civilization on Mars, that there is a portal to that from Earth, and that John goes over there.  But I can't tolerate that he's basically Superman because the gravity is about a third of that here on earth.  So that fundamentally ruined the film for me, but was arguably one of the least silly elements of it, which is interesting.  But I guess I felt it was internally inconsistent.    Then you've got films that are just bad, and this ""turn your brain off and enjoy"" is just a poor excuse for poor writing.  Unfortunately for me, because of their popularity at the moment, almost every comic-book superhero movie falls into this category.  They all follow the exact same formula, and it's tedious - there's just no suspense at all in these movies.  No surprises.  No twists.  The action is boring too.. nothing exciting or new happens in any of them, ever.  There is almost nothing of interest in them at all for me.  A few jokes, some OK effects, then over an hour of absolute drivel.  However, clearly a lot of people like that - so it's just subjective.  Saying ""turn your brain off"" is missing the point - different people like different things."

This movie doesn't fall into a strict genre, but across several - the boy and his grandfather, a typical romance, fantasy, and a bit of Monte Python and the Holy Grail.  Trying to watch it from a particular frame of reference makes is disappointing and that is one of the reasons that it failed so badly at the box office.    On the other side, if you watch the film without those preconceptions you discover it has a surprising depth - the dialogue is witty, the fantasy world rules interesting, the pace unique.

(Some people are obviously much more ""well-adjusted"" than others, etc.) In fact, I suspect that some people even use movies almost as an indirect form of meditation---suppose your life is incredibly stressful, such that you wouldn't even be able to enjoy thoroughly analyzing a movie, and the only time you can escape from your unending stream of nagging thoughts is when you can zone in to a movie and then promptly begin to zone out. For the next hour or two, you don't have to put any effort forward. You can focus solely on immediate present and, unlike in the rest of your life, not try. This isn't to say you have no idea what's going on in the movie, it's just that you don't actively work to connect hidden dots, or complex story lines, or themes or hidden symbols or anything.  What's interesting to me is that in this way, the split between the more ""fun"", hollywood type movies and the more heady movies that almost demand focus and thought becomes much clearer, and to me, this immediately raises the issue of the ultimate goal of ""art"". These mindless movies require more simplicity overall and may be technically sloppy. They may send more seasoned or passionate film analysts into fits of disgust. But that doesn't mean that they must fail to bring about emotions and insights and the feelings of something more in the universe and all the markers of a moving piece of art, but only in a very specific subset of people, the same way sometimes paintings that are considered ""poor"" by art experts can bring great meaning to others. Art is surely what the individual gets out of it, and the same should be with movies.  Now, if the question is, ""Going by the standards of technical and artistic finesse based on the values of mainstream serious film critics of the past and present eras, and projecting in an attempt to predict those artistic values of the mainstream serious film critics of all future eras, are these films made for mindless viewers good? i.e. Do these movies fit /truefilm's standards?"", then probably not, because they only serve a very narrow crowd of people. But the subjectivity of art is always an important issue to think about."

As long as I connect with the film on some level I couldn't care less how much brainpower I'm using.  I feel that some people go into a movie with an attitude to nitpick, and it never ceases to amaze me the number of insignificant details they obsess over while sometimes missing essential plot points."

And frankly, it has pauses that keep the ""destroy all of California - like The Hulk"" kind of muted.  The Terminators are not ""Hulk"" creatures in a rage - they are logical and precision-guided munitions.  I actually felt a desire to discuss why so many hate the film for it's shallowness.

I always think of these two ways of looking at it. People have a rainbow of thoughts on what this or 'popcorn film' might mean, but it usually boils down to these 2 ideas.   The first, covers films like SnowPiercer, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and largely any film that skips the details in service to a better story. These are obviously great films, but as we go lower the trend continues in films like Predator, Terminator, and Aliens. The amount of detail one can ignore, or convenience one can accept, is what makes this line shifty to track. Transformers is a god aweful mess, but for a large audience those detail skipping plot sinkholes don't exist. In much the same way Birdman having a drummer in the kitchen is acceptable to me.   The second rides that cheese line. Sharknado, Terminator 3-5, and Speed are good examples of this flash over substance measure. Again the acceptable line is wobbly. I can accept giant worms in the ground from Tremors, but shake my head at the scorpion in Transformers 1. The end of Planet of the Apes with the liberty statue was amazing, but the end of The Hobbit 2 enraged me.   Outside of this, and likely more relevant to /r/TrueFilm, is the idea of execution. 90% of watchers are just seeing flashing screen fun time, most couldn't even count the amount of cuts in a scene or know how pan shots work. Where I see a mastery level of editing being used on god aweful direction in Transformers, my friend is watching smashing metal and boom boom. So 'turning my brain off' does work to a point, but I instinctually flinch at a terible transition and I cant help but hate it."

TrueFilm,3ch6v0,scarfese,4,Tue Jul 7 21:50:35 2015 UTC,"My thoughts about movie is similar to the one in mentioned in blog - Quoting from Mathur & the Marquee  The Silence is about the complete absence of any higher authority. Without any direction, Ester and Anna are left to act out their vices and jealousies. They are sisters but they represent two opposite sides of humanity. The sensual Anna represents the body, the pursuit of carnal pleasures. Ester is the intellectual, analytic side of the human race. Johann represents innocence and he is stuck between the two women.   In a film that is mainly about miscommunication/lack of communication, even we the audience are denied any communication from our director."

TrueFilm,3ch6v0,monkeyd_ace,3,Wed Jul 8 18:57:10 2015 UTC,"The Silence is such an underrated Bergman gem--heck every Bergman movie is underrated--except for the Seventh Seal (Still great)  Though the meat of the drama is centered around the 2 sisters, I think the story's journey is centered on the boy.  We're watching the movie in the boy's POV. The hotel makes much more sense that way: the strange dwarf troupe, empty hallways, the alien language, it's all in the boy's mind--it's his adventure.  His story of wonder and fantasy contrasts the harsh and bitter relationship with his mother and her sister. They live in their bitter world constantly hurting each other. There's no journey in their life, just constant bitter spite.  The theme is communication. The boy is much more naive and thus more innocent. He can communicate with everyone else just fine. The two sisters who've been sisters for decades can't communicate anything other than spite.  It's been half a year, but the Silence still left an impact of me. The world building is great as well as the show don't tell storytelling. If you haven't watched the rest of his faith trilogy (Winter Light or Through a Glass Darkly), I recommend those and every other Bergman movie if you're interested."
TrueFilm,3ch6v0,mykunos,2,Wed Jul 8 14:37:55 2015 UTC,"I recently watched this film for the first time a few days ago as well and loved it, and I think you hinted upon something I've been thinking about regarding the movie.   To me, this film displays a sort of feverish nightmare where nobody can communicate or show affection to the ones they love. If you look at who they can connect with, it's only the people of this strange, foreign land: Ester and the porter; Anna and the waiter; Johann and the dwarves (and the porter too, to some extent). The only people that show compassion to them or connect to them on any sort of normal human level are complete strangers with a foreign tongue. It makes me ask the question, does the film give us hope that we can make true contact with other humans? Or does it tell us that familiarity breeds resentment and detachment?  This is my fourth Bergman film (I've seen Wild Strawberries and the faith trilogy) and this theme of loneliness and incommunicability among one's familiars seems to run strong with his films. As I watched The Silence I kept an eye out for what Ebert calls the ""basic Bergman two-shot"" which he describes as the following:   He places two faces on the screen, in very close physical juxtaposition, but the characters are not looking at each other. Each is focused on some unspecified point off-screen, each is looking in a different direction. They are so close, and yet so separated. It is the visual equivalent of the fundamental belief of his cinema: That we try to reach out to one another, but more often than not are held back by compulsions within ourselves.   To me, this has been the key to understanding Bergman. He uses a dynamic of physical proximity linked with emotional distance to convey a sense and mood of utter spiritual and existential isolation. It's pretty frightening but I think Bergman always comes out the optimist who says we don't have to be estranged from one another.   I keep wanting to give a great sweeping unified explanation of Bergman's films but I find that each film keeps giving a nuance to his conversation that won't allow that. I think I've fallen for Bergman ;) Next on the list by him are the big ones: Persona and the Seventh Seal!"
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,Hyperbole_Hater,47,Wed Jul 8 19:35:35 2015 UTC,"When people call Fury Road feminist they're talking about how it explores feminist themes, they're not talking about a simplistic ""men and women are just as good, look Max let Furiosa shoot!"". The film is essentially a giant exploration of patriarchy theory and the ways in which patriarchal power structures harm men and women and lead to conflict. While Starship Troopers is an example of a post-feminist world where the genders are truly equal Mad Max if feminist not because I of its content but instead because it presents its content from a feminist perspective.   Why are only men cannon fodder? If Furiosa is a strong woman, where are the other fanatic female soldiers? Why aren't faceless women being run over and yelling ""Witnesssss me!"" with candid vigor?   Most of what you've listed is exactly why the film has a feminist label. There are no other female soldiers because in the world Fury Road presents is with women exist only  for breeding. It's not that they don't fight, it's that they don't: the society views them as valuable in another way. The comparisons between this and patriarchal societies are easy to draw.   While the women in Fury Road are breeding stock the male sphere revolves entirely around war. The war boys are conditioned to fight and die for Joe and dream of a glorious death. They're interchangeable and expendable because that is how patriarchal societies view men. This is an exploration of how patriarchal societies viewed the strength of men as their most important contribution and also an exploration of how when society is heavily patriarchal it sucks for everyone apart from the elites. Their devotion to Joe is analogous to how the upper classes use patriotism, religion, and other grand promises to convince low status men to give up their lives. As one of the brides said, they don't know any better than the world they're in.  The elites in Joe's army are all members of his family, these represent the ruling class of men and as a result they're the only ones who wield any real power. They may follow Joe's orders but they do so for power and women rather than for what they believe in. As well as being a key aspect of the plot their deformities are partially a reference to the  common practice of interbreeding in monarchies and partially a reference to how those at the top of society aren't worthy of placing themselves above their subjects.  Furiosa is a character quite like Max in that her backstory isn't spelled out to allow the viewer to fill in the gaps. Maybe her missing arm is the result of a deformity so Joe deemed her unsuitable to be a bride. Maybe Joe realised he needed a right hand woman he could trust and as Furiosa hadn't been fed his indoctrination like the warboys she was a good candidate. Maybe unbeknownst to her she's Joe's daughter, and 'the green place' she was kidnapped from was where her mother took her to be safe from him. Either way the origins of her badassery isn't a plot hole, it's just something left to the imagination."

I think the point that the others are trying to get across is that it essentially does not matter how Furiosa earned her rank. The fact that she is in such a high position despite her gender is enough for the audience to infer her greatness. It's true that we don't know how it happened, but we don't need to know because that wasn't the focus of the film. The fact that Miller uses a female character in such a way without bringing up these questions is what contributes to the subtle feminist bent in the film. He forces us to accept that she is someone to be feared and respected even though it makes no sense for her to be there. In a world dominated by misogyny as in Immortan Joe's, she stands as a symbol that women can and will succeed against all odds, just as men like Max can.   I hope that makes sense. I'm also a bit hesitant to throw the feminist label around because it wasn't at the forefront of the film, but there are moments in which I feel Miller is trying to undermine the male-hero arc that dominates the American film industry. Take Hayao Miyazaki's films, for instance. Almost all of them boast having strong female characters as protagonists, but does that make the film feminist? Of course not, but because Miller is able to provide the subtle dichotomy of female roles in the film (between women like Furiosa vs. milk breeders), we can see that those elements are indeed there."

Of course, there's also a value in the concept of female soldiers dying indiscriminately, but, ehh, I digress. Mad Maxine would have been sick, and presumably work completely the same.

TrueFilm,3cl5ru,npcdel,5,Thu Jul 9 20:24:22 2015 UTC,"I agree, adding more females as soldiers in Joe's army probably would increase feminist advocacy. But in turn it would depict Joe as someone who gives equal opportunity to females as he does to the males, which I don't think falls in line with his characterization.   Furiosa's rise to power is ambiguous but I think it is incorrect to view that ambiguity as a plot hole. And I don't think this detracts from the feminist qualities at all just because we don't know her origins (this is where our opinions differ). If anything, I think it leaves room for an exciting prequel movie to be made in the future. Again, I want to emphasize the point that feminism wasn't the central theme of the movie - if it were, all those things you stated would have definitely helped the film reach that status. We praise the film for its action, set pieces, environmental themes as well as the nods to feminism. I'm not trying to reduce the theme in question in any way - only making the point that there is an inherent danger in over analyzing certain qualities which were never given prominent focus to begin with."

I'm curious about this part. Do you mean that because the main character is a female, that's its feminist perspective? I guess I'm putting those that claim it's got feminist perspectives to task, and saying it's not really doing enough. I do like that you called ST ""post-feminist"". That's an interesting label.    Most of what you've listed is exactly why the film has a feminist label. There are no other female soldiers because in the world Fury Road presents is with women exist only for breeding. It's not that they don't fight, it's that they don't: the society views them as valuable in another way. The comparisons between this and patriarchal societies are easy to draw.   Hmm, this claim that they are viewed only as breeders is odd, specifically since Furiosa is so highly ranked (which I say feels like an unsupported character arc). It makes the whole concept of her even more staggeringly confusing, IMO. The themes you mention however, don't take away from the movie's value or its support of some feminsim. That's why my title is the way it is: that Furiosa's existence and strength feels feminist, yet creates some gapping holes in the universe. All of which could be remedied by a prequel or something, but we're talking about Fury Road as a standalone.    While the women in Fury Road are breeding .... Either way the origins of her badassery isn't a plot hole, it's just something left to the imagination.   These next three paragraphs are well written critique, and I appreciate your insight into this. The only difference is that while she is comparable to Max, her backstory is rooted in the knowledge that Joe HAD to trust her and she HAD to rise to power. Max's isn't in any way, and if he was a woman, it would not be problematic in any way. In fact, switching Max and Furiosa would make for an interesting thought experiment.   It's not that it's impossible to imagine Furiosa's rise, it's just that one has to come up with abundant mental gymnastics to make any of it fit. Had there been any presence of females in the army, that wouldn't be necessary. Instead, you, I, and the majority of commenters here are intent on making assumptions to support a character's implausible existence in a role she couldn't possibly find herself in... which is ok, cuz we want to appreciate the movie. I do think that when people bring up the feminist adovcacy (which is a good thing ultimately), it may be important to question Furiosa's plausibility in that role, and the short-sights the film takes to get her there.   Good response though, bruh. Appreciate the tone!"
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,lordhadri,30,Thu Jul 9 19:21:34 2015 UTC,"Furiosa's role as the only top tier warrior in the army makes no sense at all. It's completely unbelievable from the context depicted in the film, specifically because there's not a single other female warrior from that army --- leader, grunt, mechanic, slave, ammo-supplier, or even anything.   Because I hate myself, here's an in-universe reason why: She's a fucking badass. She probably killed and maimed her way to the top after likely ""washing out"" of Immortan Joe's breeding program. It's heavily hinted at (and by that I mean, ""explicity fucking said"") that she did some real bad shit to get to be the leader of the War-Rig, up to and including probably capturing a fleeing Wife in the past and bringing her back to Immortan Joe's rape camps.  If your brain can't envision a woman who is just meaner, ornery-er and just about the toughest damned sunnuvabitch than anyone else in the wastes, that failing lies with your imagination, because I totally believed that Furiosa was capable of fucking up the day of any pissant Warboy who gave her lip."

As stated, she's not the most badass or anything close to that, and it's the lack of any other woman within that cities army that makes the connection near impossible. Perhaps a prequel backstory showing her rise to power would be worthwhile, but I am curious how that might be structured.   Above all, none of that tackles why there aren't warboys and wargirls. IE, the crux of the argument."
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,lordhadri,10,Wed Jul 8 20:59:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually disagree that Furiosa as a man would inherently make the film more believable (unless they showed the same conviction and competence and drive as Theron did), but I think your broader point about tokenism makes a fair amount of sense: At least from your point of view, including more women in Joe's society as a whole would have required less suspension of your disbelief.  And that's fine—though I think the absence of ""war girls"" is a completely peripheral issue to Furiosa's identity—but I actually think there's an interesting contrast brought up by a woman having proven herself and gained unambiguous respect for her competence and achievements even in a very patriarchal, sexually exploitative little kingdom like Immortan Joe's. She clearly was in a position to be close to Joe even if she was brought in under other pretenses, and end up in a prime place to show her skills and resourcefulness, so I didn't find that to be much of a stretch.  A lot of people view words like ""feminist"" or ""racist"" or whatever as some binary thing, or even something overt which infuses the character of something. In my book, Mad Max is ""feminist"" in a qualitative sense which invokes a feeling of degrees for several small reasons: They made primary characters women even if it wasn't the path of least resistance. They implied exploitation without recreating some of it. They didn't force a romance between Max and Furiosa."

Miller may be a feminist but I think he's more interested in the game of boys chase girls going on in the movie, and so are we.  It's true that we don't see what a normal day at the Citadel is like, but within the parameters of a conflict that takes place over two days, I don't think we need to. That we don't see much of Furiosa's life isn't a flaw or plothole at all. We're not going to see all worldbuilding revealed in one movie. Indeed, a movie that reveals all its worldbuilding at once is the worst kind, because it means it has the least to say.  Even so, we do see aspects of life at the Citadel alluded to. That's why a movie with nearly nonstop action goes out of its way to peer into the apartments where Joe's wives live. We needed to see what they were so desperate to leave behind. And I think Furiosa's role is alluded to as well. We see that Citadel society is organized according to how much people's physical abilities are worth to Joe. So presumably Furiosa is worth a great deal to him. We don't know precisely what her prior relationship to Joe and his wives is, but we know that they have one. We know she was kidnapped. Put two and two together: she's worth more as a soldier than a human dairy cow or breeder. If she was worth nothing she'd be cast out with the other worthless cripples. Sure, Joe's no egalitarian because he can't afford to be. But he's not irrationally prejudiced either. Even a blind dude can still play the guitar.   I have to reiterate /u/npcdel's point. Because Furiosa is female it's more understandable why she would betray Joe for his wives than a male lieutenant. But her character is not reduced to only her sex, either. The movie also goes out of its way to show that not all women in this world are like her or want to be like her. It doesn't matter whether that's feminist or not, it's just good writing."
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,npcdel,3,Wed Jul 8 20:58:46 2015 UTC,"Seems sort of an unfairly hollow reading of his intent, especially given that the protagonist is a woman and the story is told from the perspective of women and all moral discourse is between women.  This is a movie where men act and women debate among THEMSELVES until men start to adopt their perspectives.  Insofar as the movie is concerned solely about the political concerns of its post-apocalyptic women, their self-worth, and their ideas regarding the power structures they inhabit, it's feminine. Its violence is debatable with regard to feminism, but even that is an aspect of what feminism entails and worthy of discussion."
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,SenseiMike3210,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:59:18 2015 UTC,"My reading isn't hollow. Reducing what Miller is going for to someone else's isms is what's hollow, that was my point.  I don't think there's such a thing as masculine or feminine violence. There's rape as a particular weapon of war against women but Fhry Road doesn't take that on as directly as Mad Max or The Road Warrior did. What I get from Fury Road is that there's an eternal battle of the sexes and we're seeing a scenario in which it exploded into open warfare, but without resorting to the exploitation method of ALL the female characters picking up and blowing away men as retribution. It makes the point that reliable men ought to side with women against other men after all.  Anyway, that's why the reaction summed up by Sarkeesian rubbed me the wrong way. Violence in movies is often coded as a dude thing in genre movies for men but that doesn't mean it has to be. It's not hypocritical to depict a lot of it as long as we get a sense of the cost, which Fury Road does."
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,SenseiMike3210,-4,Thu Jul 9 06:21:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting points.   I appreciate life in the Citadel, but it's far more complicated to imagine Furiosa's value than simply ""putting two and two together"". Indeed we don't know much about her at all, and we essentially have to make a great deal of assumptions to come to the place where the story starts: namely she's earned the respect of a not only Joe (respect and loyalty, and TRUST), but also has combat, mechanic, and driving know-how. These come from years of training, so it's not likely she was a breeder, though... because there is no other context at all, it's almost like this is the most likely reason.   However, note that every single thing implausibility would make much much more sense if there were even 25% females in the army.    Because Furiosa is female it's more understandable why she would betray Joe for his wives over a male lieutenant.    This simply continues to beg the question of how she might earn such a lofty title, especially when there are no other women in any positions of power anywhere. It's very perplexing how she would even interact with them, or get to know them. But I agree, her being a female does make that connection easier, but it's still heavily assumed. All in all, good points, but to me these kinda highlight an atmospheric/universal structure need to suspend disbelief. Still, great film."
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,DaEvil1,12,Wed Jul 8 21:08:28 2015 UTC,"we essentially have to make a great deal of assumptions to come to the place where the story starts   I see nothing wrong with this.   You're trying to resolve something you see as an implausibility with and even bigger implausibility. The world reverts back to a society with strongly stratified gender roles from which the conflict of the movie is derived. All warboys are male (am I really saying this, it's in their name) because they a fanatically devoted, automotive, masculine, possibly homosexual warrior cult. They define themselves in opposition to anyone different and do the footwork of oppression. That's how dictatorship works. There's no need for suicide warriors to have families so women play no role in their culture; why do you think Nux's life changes so much when he finally talks to one? There's little need for specialists, so there are male children and female children, and their roles are assigned at birth. There are enough boys to be trained as soldiers that the girls produce the food and goods, keeping everything in equilibrium."

Maybe the death-cult rape-gang madman preferred to have a woman in charge yet visibly under his control so his concubines could see that even women bow to him. Or maybe she was just the meanest, best person in his employ and he likes having the best in charge of his precious War-Rig. Which is, of course, a feminist message of equality - if you are a bad enough dude/lady, you get to drive the War-Rig."

TrueFilm,3cl5ru,swantonist,3,Wed Jul 8 21:23:39 2015 UTC,"Their point is that there are many possible in-universe explanations for Furiosa's status in the Citadel and nobody except you feels like they need the particular explanation spoon-fed to them. I think the movie works MUCH better leaving it to your imagination. I just assumed that she must have done some pretty nasty shit to have climbed the military ladder in such a patriarchal society. The implications that her status carries just adds more of a sense that she's one badass motherfucker.   And it's not that unbelievable within the film. It's not like Miller gave her the ability to fly or something and never explained it, then I'd agree with you."
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,BZenMojo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:01:19 2015 UTC,"Many possibilities, but none with any support from the universe. My point is that the movie has a during female lead (great) but at the expense of sensible context (plotholey) which leads to a film that has a lot of praise for feminism (great), but actually really misses the boat by missing female cannon fodder or world context (not so great, but this happens often). These points kinda make it unfortunate that the feminism praise is only surface level due, and even opens the film up to advocacy critiques."
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,doubledoverweeds,2,Thu Jul 9 15:14:39 2015 UTC,"it is basically impossible to imagine her rise to leadership in an army solely comprised of other men.   This is what you said originally.  It is actually really really easy to imagine. /u/npcdel gave you a few good examples of sensible in-universe explanations. It's especially easy to believe considering the REAL LIFE historical examples of similar women figures within similar contexts provided by another user elsewhere in the thread. It is not far-reaching to imagine that she got to where she is by being more badass or a better fighter or generally more violent than the other men. Being any of those things would probably get you pretty high up in the hierarchy of the Citadel. Having a character who overcomes seemingly insurmountable adversity does not make a plot-hole. You are the only one having trouble believing it. For everyone else it gives more (ominous) depth to her character.   As for the ""surface level praise"" of its feminist character please read my post in the thread where I go point by point through the surface level and not so surface level feminist qualities of the piece. I think your confusion here is owing to a lack of imagination or understanding of feminist cultural criticism."
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,doubledoverweeds,2,Thu Jul 9 15:51:19 2015 UTC,"How does her gender come into the equation to a significant degree though? The problem you seem to have is that it'd take something extraordinary for a woman to rise through the ranks like that competing with hordes of men. But the exact same thing would be required for a man to stand out amongst the hordes of men. No matter the gender, extraordinary circumstances are demanded, but just because the movie doesn't expand on that, doesn't mean it's not plausible that a female could fulfill those circumstances. Is it harder for a women to get up there? Maybe, but is the difference between a man and a woman significant enough to make it implausible? I'd say no."
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,SenseiMike3210,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:50:11 2015 UTC,"Beyond extraordinary, actually. Her gender would make her the only type of warrior in an otherwise nearly identical group. It's a near impossible imagining that she was trained near these same dudes. She would have had to gain Joe's trust some other way, likely."
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,SenseiMike3210,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:53:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but again where is the beyond extraordinary part? Joe got a blind guy to play his war-guitar, so it's obvious that he's open to seeing roles being filled in unorthodox ways. If there's a decent chance that she and Joe would get to interact in a setting that could underline her usability as a warrior (which there definitely is), there really is no problem with her having the role that she does."
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,LuigiVanPeebles,3,Thu Jul 9 22:06:08 2015 UTC,"There's multiple definitions of feminism, feminists are not a hive mind that 100% agree on everything.  So Mad Max isn't going to fulfill everyone's criteria of what a feminist movie is.  Mad Max had a basic appeal because it had several strong female characters who had their own personalities and were well realized and avoided a lot of tired tropes.  Strong female characters are becoming more common in movies but its still very common for action films to have 1 token female in the group and for her to have no personality or agency in the story.  Many women found the representation in Mad Max refreshing and that speaks for something.  You can hear a few insightful perspectives on how ""feminist"" it is here (audio)"
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,randomerquery,-1,Wed Jul 8 20:43:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed that the term has many perspectives. Agreed that it's refreshing. I like its feminist advocacy, I just think it's barely showcasing equality (which in the second paragraph is how I define feminism)."
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,hipsterparalegal,3,Wed Jul 8 21:00:29 2015 UTC,"I think you're wrong. It makes more sense as a woman. The main driving plot point of the movie is that she felt sympathy for the women kept captive. I'd argue that this is because she was a woman. Do you imagine any of the warboys or other leaders caring? Even max didn't really care until he spent more time with them. I don't think the movie is feminist at all objectively. But recent times and controversies online make it seem that way. I hope there will be a day when there are more than usual important female characters, or let alone just a strong female character and it isn't seen as ""different"" or ""feminist"" because it is in an action movie and women are not allowed to do that lol.   You argue that it isn't believable for Furiosa to have risen through the ranks to imperator because she is a woman. I'll propose this: She is the only woman in that war party because of how she exceptional she is. She is the only woman to have impressed all the males. That makes more sense right?"
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,CrackedPepper86,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:27:31 2015 UTC,"She's not just the only woman, she's more respected than any man. So she's clearly exceptional by definition."

That makes more sense right?   Eh, only theoretically and semantically. It's not a practical imagining to have her rise the ranks some way within the war boys, so she must have gained Joe's trust another way, which isn't conveyed in any aspect. She's ""exceptional"" is almost like a ""deus ex machina"" argument, and is effectively the same as saying she's the protagonist.    She is the only woman in that war party because of how she exceptional she is. She is the only woman to have impressed all the males. That makes more sense right?   It has no plot cohesiveness without any in-film context, IMO. For her to exist as the only woman, she effectively has to overcome many, many, many more hurdles than any other man because there are NO women. Unless what you're saying is that she rose to the top because she is a woman that managed to impress the males, and as such, she was given an easier time to get to the top. However, the fact that no other women exist in Joe's army makes this seem impossible as there would be other females trying to get to the top as well."
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,newera14,3,Thu Jul 9 20:59:24 2015 UTC,"It's not clear to me that she worked her way up through the ranks of the War Boys, who are presented as a fanatical cult in which conventions of masculinity are a defining feature. In fact, Furiosa is presented in opposition to them almost from the beginning, since she doesn't share their beliefs. Also, there are three main tribes, I think, in the larger community that the movie presents, besides the various communities beyond their control, so the War Boys are not the only warriors in the area, despite making up most of the fighters in the film. It doesn't seem implausible that she proved herself to Immortan Joe by doing work beyond the scope of the War Boys."
TrueFilm,3cl5ru,vaunred,0,Thu Jul 9 02:32:01 2015 UTC,"In fact, Furiosa is presented in opposition to them almost from the beginning, since she doesn't share their beliefs.

TrueFilm,3cl5ru,npcdel,2,Thu Jul 9 20:54:41 2015 UTC,"Not at all. In any military, there are officers who do not work their way up through the ranks or prove themselves by some other means than as cannon fodder. Soldiers follow them. This isn't ""unlikely,"" it's just a fact. The War Boys also follow orders from Immortan's sons and from the leaders of the other clans. It seems like you're just objecting to the idea that an all-male fighting force would follow an officer who happens to be a woman, which sounds more like a hangup than a rational objection.  Edit: for historical reference, see:   Queen Artemisia of Caria  Boudicca  Joan of Arc  among various other less famous examples.   And it's not a flaw in the movie, it's just something you didn't like. Personally I'm annoyed when movies go out of their way to explain backstories. Mad Max clearly presents itself as a film which is more invested in spectacle and quick pacing than exposition. I don't care what Furiosa did to get where she is. She's clearly an intelligent, skilled and resilient warrior. That's all I need to know."

TrueFilm,3cdcgp,PilotLights,13,Tue Jul 7 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed it, but still felt it was a bit indulgent at times, and could have maybe cut the fat a little. In my mind the mark of a truly great film is one where every tiny gesture feels deliberate, as if there is no moment wasted.   While it's been a few years and I can't point to any one superfluous part of Magnolia, my favorite PTA movie has to be There Will Be Blood, where the Jonny Greenwood score and unparalleled performance by Daniel Day Lewis made the three hour run time fly by. I saw it twice in theaters, a rarity for me, and am still struck by the bleak, Faustian vision of the film. Magnolia is dope too, but I'm not certain it's even PTA's best."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,nasty_k,4,Tue Jul 7 04:15:32 2015 UTC,"I think the Master is his best personally. Visually, it's on a whole different level than his other films, which could be due to it NOT using the same cinematographer as his other films, Robert Elswit, who was busy, presumably working on the Borne Legacy or pre-production for Nightcrawler. Instead, Mihai Malaimare Jr. worked the camera (and convinced PTA to use 70mm film instead of 35mm film somehow) for shots that literally couldn't have been conceived of with less powerful cameras (despite the huge amount of detail lost in 1080p digital conversion :P). For example, Freddie passed out on the boat with the water behind him, the mountain landscapes when in the desert, or the detail and pores in faces of characters during meetings.   The only other movie that moved me as much purely through visuals is Samsara, which (maybe NOT so coincidentally) also used 70mm film. If you're willing to put up with that much shit (huge, loud, obnoxious and old cameras that no studio will touch) they you've already got your ideas together and you're about to blow people's minds.  I didn't even bother mentioning any of the plot, because everything besides maybe Punch Drunk Love and Inherent Vice are practically the same plot with PTA. Loveable weirdo is good at something, but he has a gruff father-figure that doesn't like liking things, and he's in a time period that causes conflict with the characters, and there will be very little resolution, and its mostly not even about the story, its a character-study, or maybe it's a statement about the time period it was set in, a moment in time crafted so perfectly, in a sense becoming another character. I don't think this is a flaw, but I do think the cinematographer is more worth mentioning."

TrueFilm,3cdcgp,SlightlyOffensive,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:58:46 2015 UTC,"Not at all, but i think the same thing about most of my favorite directors. Telling a story is hard to get good at, most people just end up reworking the same story again and again, because that's the story they know how to tell. The best directors in the world do this, everyone from David Fincher (someone slowly finding out something they probably wished they hadn't), to Michael Haneke (someone NOT finding out something they should be glad they didn't, but the audience isn't as lucky), to Terrence Malick (the meaning life, scaled down essentially), to Nicholas Winding Refn (a man is put into a compromising position and has to do violent things). Most of them admit to this. Boogie Nights, There Will be Blood, and the Master all feature distinct periods in American history where huge social change had either just happened or was about to, distinct characters who have big issues with their families or lack therof, a distinct group with a strong sense of homogeny appears to which the character either will or will not be able to belong to, a character suffers with drug addiction, lots of penis metaphors, and finally (most importantly) powerful, God-like father figures with billowous voices who end up incredibly rich, but more or less probably miserable. There is to be absolutely NO narration, because then you might actually know what characters are thinking, and that's what makes PTA good, having no idea what motivations of individual characters are unless you pay attention.  Obviously, Inherent Vice and Punch Drunk Love and even Magnolia are a little different, so maybe HALF his movies have this certain formula to them. I prefer the formula ones personally, but that's just preference."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,ifyourheadexplodes,8,Tue Jul 7 05:16:08 2015 UTC,"Again, you're not wrong per se, but your descriptions of these ""same stories"" are all incredibly vague and pettifogged. I mean, Boogie Nights and TWBB are TOTALLY different, and yet you're trying to tell me they're the same? Come on. Read what you're writing. Your Fincher deconstruction is: ""Somebody slowly finding out something they wish they hadn't"" where even if that were accurate, can't you see how broad of an idea that is? That's an extremely basic concept that could be turned into a thousand unique stories.  Some of their films may have overlapping ideas in them (which is obvious and makes total sense), but that doesn't mean the story is the same. Fight Club and Social Network, or Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line, There is no formula the directors are sticking to here. There is a creative vision shared between them, but the formulas for developing them are different.  Let's face it, all you're really saying is ""sometimes, this director makes a movie that shares similarities with another movie they made,"" which isn't really saying anything at all. But I have to ask: do you really enjoy trying to break down movies like this? Trying to cut them down so they fit into these neat little descriptions? I would go crazy if I did that for every movie I was into."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,SlightlyOffensive,-4,Tue Jul 7 05:53:57 2015 UTC,"It might be painting with broad strokes, but those were single sentence assesments. I easily could have said far more about each directors movies in a way that still connects entirely to the philosophy and idea structure behind each film.  For example, since you pointed out Fincher, I'll do him. We start with a character who has clearly grown morose and cynical about major aspects of his post-modern urban prison, but in a sort of darkly comical way. How do we know this about them? DON'T WORRY, THEY WILL TELL YOU. AGAIN and AGAIN. They ascribe to some kind of institute of the society they claim to have grown to vilify and represent its own deconstruction, a corporation, a police station, a college, a police station again, a marriage, or, in its very most ham-fisted, the entire US federal government. Our character will meet someone. They are literally the inverse, the manic pixie dream girl/boy in other fictions. They tell our character to LIVE, to ignite their passion for life and all its darkly beautiful possibilities, with their smokey philosophy. They're usually hot, but in kind of a dangerous way. Brad Pitt played it several times, Timberlake once, but more recently Fincher likes to leave this role for the main female character. Then they will get into some scheme, involving said institution they belong to, that represents their own ascent into a higher place within society, as well as descent from their previously held beliefs, and in a sense represent WHY that same philosophy CANNOT work, but also why it is so appealing in the first place, i.e. catching terrible people involves becoming a worse person, creating a revolution causes eventually causes its own form Fascism again, once their ride has fully compromised them as a character.    It's the fact that it can be asserted to EVERY SINGLE MOVIE they make, and few that they did not, at least in the time period they created it (directors steal from others constantly, but usually a few decades between one another). I could literally write one of these for all of my favorite directors, and would only love them more for it. Don't tell any story, tell your best story. And do it again and again until you TRULY know what it means, and then make it fucking perfect."

Most directors do, and this isn't a bad thing. Art is supposed to be very personal and about vision, and its not like people have like 9 different, complicated artistic visions that they can pick and choose whatever they want, right? I mean really you've only got one brain, and if you're really making something amazing each and every time, it's just going to be your same view of things told through different lenses and hues. And hopefully, your art will evolve and grow more multifaceted and complicated just as your own personality does, but that same vision will be present, lurking underneath the patina. I personally think that makes movies much more beautiful and personal, but if you prefer to think otherwise, by all means.  If you would like me to do this for other directors to prove my point, Tarantino would be very easy, as would David Lynch, or Martin Scorcese, but I'll go ahead and spare you any more my longform bitching lol. I guess all I'm trying to say, is go ahead and look for patterns. They're already there, and taking a look doesn't make the movie any worse, at least for me."

I wrote a super long piece on the film on Letterboxd, but it was a few months ago and looking back on it I don't think it was written that well.  It's hard to organize my flowing thoughts on such an epic and ambitious movie. Though there may be considered flaws in some of aspects of the film, I wouldn't have it any other way. It's such a personal film for Paul Thomas Anderson and it shows through the flaws, and through the incredible writing and characters.  I also love how it shows that we are all connected through love and loneliness, something that all of the characters face. Whether it is facing the loneliness of death  without anyone at the end of life to being ostracized and isolated as a child, all of the characters face loneliness in some way. The polar opposite of this is love and it is what keeps all of the characters from going completely off the edge. It's what keeps the film from becoming an overly depressing melodrama and it gives it the optimistic smile at the end of the film that hits me every time.   All of this wouldn't be possible without the nuanced way PTA writes his characters. He doesn't judge them or hate them, even the most despicable of people like Frank Mackey.  I know this isn't that coherent, but I'll take any opportunity I can to talk about this movie, I don't care if I make sense in the process."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,FreddieDodd,2,Tue Jul 7 02:40:34 2015 UTC,"Hey it's my favorite movie too, and now that I look at your link, I follow you on letterboxd."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,Unassuming-username1,15,Tue Jul 7 23:02:25 2015 UTC,"I agree about watching his other films. The Master is my favorite film ever. However, it should be noted that TWBB and TM are far different stylistically and narratively than Magnolia. The constant, I feel, through all of Anderson's films is his ability to get the best out of each actor. The performances are all worthy of praise.   Also, I find that all of his films excel in the soundtrack department."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,PieBlaCon,8,Tue Jul 7 02:30:17 2015 UTC,"there was a post some months ago of a guy trying to explore consistency in Paul Thomas Anderson's directing, the interesting thing about is even if you add ""inherent Vice"" to his catalog, there isn't any obvious pattern to the types of movies or style he employs, it would not be obvious that the director of any one of his films directed any of the others, I think. Hell I just learned by reading here that he also directed Punch Drunk Love, would have never figured that out unless told."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,Ayadd,12,Tue Jul 7 02:43:57 2015 UTC,"He has a pretty consistent theme of struggling with abusive fathers. In most of Magnolia, there stemmed father issues with many of the character relationships. In hard eight, it's John C Reilly and Philip Baker Hall. Boogie Nights is Burt Reynolds taking Mark Walberg in like a son after getting kicked out of his house. TWBB entire plot revolves around a man who takes in a son but gives up on the relationship when as his life is dependent on greed. Also in the Master, PSH (rip) takes on the paternal role with Freddy, the lost wanderer.    In almost all of his films, the central or underlying plot revolves around a broken relationship with a son and his father, or the new relationship between a man in power befriending someone in a lesser position and raising then as the son they never had."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,ThorsGrundle,5,Tue Jul 7 04:24:22 2015 UTC,"More generally I would say that ""family"" is a theme, but on some level extended family and those sort of false relations people get in looking for family where there is none. This comes through most potently IMO in Boogie Nights, where the familial theme between Wahlberg and Moore's characters, but to a lesser extent in Burt Reynolds as well. Wahlberg's leaves his family, an abusive mom and complacent dad, for the porn industry where they hit really hard on Moore as his surrogate mom, and he as her surrogate son (and as the tables turn it is he who becomes abusive).  It's what makes their first sex scene so interesting compared to other slick Hollywood skin. On its nose the scene may smack of incest, but really it's this lovely moment where she's guiding him and he's nervous. The sexuality is subtracted from the non-porn shots of them, and subverted in the porn shots by what we know is not as apparent. It's the same temperment you'd find any other film that had a mom showing her kid how to ride a bike etc.    Magnolia, has less of this warmth though still the same thematic content throughout. I've read it described as operatic in tone and that certainly seems to be the case but it also tragic more often than comic. I've never seen people so resolute in the perpetuation of their own suffering before, and yet so hurt by it as well. The film builds with a constant tension and yet never wears thin. The three hours absolutely drift by and this is one of the few films that can actually dip into a musical number without it feeling entirely forced or out of place. It's rare  to have a film this utterly unique have each scene feel so inevitable and yet surprising.    I wish this film would have been a turning point in Tom Cruise's career where he veered as many aging successful actors do into more serious material, but these days he seem content to keep making action movies for whatever reason. Perhaps this will be one of the last real gems in his oeuvre, but what a gem it is."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,deepsoulfunk,2,Tue Jul 7 05:24:14 2015 UTC,"Tom Cruise's career was like that from the start. Even the first few Mission Impossible movies aren't your typical action franchise. It wasn't till more recently that he started doing mostly action movies. Even most of those, I think, have been surprisingly interesting projects."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,lordhadri,2,Tue Jul 7 11:46:48 2015 UTC,"I can't say I've seen them all, but Knight and Day and MI:iii felt like mid shelf action flicks, devoid of the real depth I think he could reach. Anything you'd recommend to help change my mind though?"
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,deepsoulfunk,2,Tue Jul 7 12:26:15 2015 UTC,Most people liked Edge of Tomorrow even though it also felt to me like a modern B movie imbued with the power of Cruise. Jack Reacher was like that too. I actually liked Oblivion more than both but most people wont agree with that. Collateral and Valkyrie are mainly drama roles. And who could forget his supporting role in Tropic Thunder...
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,lordhadri,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:31:15 2015 UTC,"Valkyrie was OK, but it just didn't have enough going on to elevate it above a basic drama to me. I'd say that film was killing it for the first five minutes or so when he gets attacked, but then the rest of it is a thriller to see if they can kill Hitler."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,deepsoulfunk,2,Tue Jul 7 12:35:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with the first few movies, but The Master I don't think its a paternal role, its a power dynamic between friends. Also, it doesn't apply to Punch Drunk Love or his recent Inherent Vice. But the idea of broken relationships is something clearly central which I didn't think about."

Anyways, Magnolia was one of the few that I made sure I grabbed and kept safe so that I couldn't sell it. It is honestly one of my favorite movies for so many reasons, but the main one, I think, is that it's one of the most honest films I've ever seen. You see into all of these characters in a way most other movies don't or can't accomplish.   Crash ripped it off so bad though."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,ulysseshead,10,Tue Jul 7 03:19:05 2015 UTC,"I would say PTA and Haggis were both thinking of Nashville. It's hard to not have multiple characters and storylines and not references Altman, who, btw, is referencing Renoir."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,theseed,3,Tue Jul 7 02:30:13 2015 UTC,PTA's on record as saying Altman is a huge influence on his work and Magnolia in particular.
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,lordhadri,7,Tue Jul 7 05:02:20 2015 UTC,"Haggis was probably thinking of Traffic, not Magnolia."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,Ayadd,3,Tue Jul 7 08:23:58 2015 UTC,"I never got around to watching Crash. I started it, but my DVD kept glitching.   Traffic though was also phenomenal. Those large cast, multi-plotted films are so ambitious (and so easy to fail) that when they work you can't help but love them."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,lordhadri,12,Tue Jul 7 03:36:27 2015 UTC,"I actually hated Crash and thought it was Oscar bait and lacked any actual subtlety, but that's me. I love Magnolia because as OP said, there's a lack of structure or narrative that adds to the absurdity of the characters and their experiences, which only builds on the impact of the film."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,choldslingshot,3,Tue Jul 7 04:00:41 2015 UTC,I guess so. What people say about Cloud Atlas is all true but I couldn't help but enjoy it anyway because I loved that it existed at all.
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,ifyourheadexplodes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:22:20 2015 UTC,Cloud Atlas was wildly amibitious and I feel majorly successful if for no other reason than they did an absolutely AMAZING adaptation from the book to the film.  Like they recut the entire structure of the narrative by honing in on key points in each story line and connecting them together all bringing along the separate narratives which collectively advance the overall message of the film.  That alone I feel merits recognition.
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,indianadave,5,Tue Jul 7 05:50:23 2015 UTC,"The scene with Tom Cruise broadcasting his ""seminar"" of rampant misogyny was incredible. I mean seriously, they made me realize how good of an actor that guy was. He really is so committed to roles, he will take them as far as he possibly can. Which made me kinda sad, because he's clearly vulnerable and only cares about impressing deep down, and that's what makes Scientology so appealing to most people.  And after seeing the Master (and knowing full well PTA actually met Tom Cruise on the set of Eyes Wide Shut, in which his character becomes involved with a rich and powerful cult) I think his character was actually a statement about the power of ""preaching"" and cults of personality in general, but done in a somewhat comedic sense. The part where he gets a guy to tell a very sensitive story to him in order to become more appealing was very indicative of the methods religious groups use as well."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,indianadave,3,Sun Jul 12 06:42:43 2015 UTC,They did some fake PSA's which ran on late night TV in 99. They should be online or on the DVDs. Really seemed like both PTA and Cruise enjoyed developing the character
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,indianadave,2,Tue Jul 7 04:48:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I bet. I told my wife during one of Cruise's scenes ""This had to just be a fun character to play. So over the top and ridiculous that it had to just be enjoyable."""
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,lordhadri,7,Tue Jul 7 05:42:21 2015 UTC,"I love Boogie Nights, I really like Hard 8, and I think TWBB and The Master are some of the best films of the century thus far. I think PTA is an unquestioned genius, and this was in his period where even his off hand work - like this Fiona video for the Pleasantville soundtrack cover of the Beatles song--- are spectacular.   I think Magnolia is an awful, awful film. It's a gross misfire of intellectual shorthand--meaning I think there are parts of PTA's philosophy which he could eloquently elucidate given time or another film, but he passes off the end result, but not the reasoning or process behind it. He ties his personal view of LA valley outcomes to a slew of diverse characters, and then tries to magically stitch it together by using coincidence and miracles; this is opposed to doing it in a narrative grounding which would make the result more organic and in touch with the film.  It's joyless, overwrought, the drama is no better than the average 90's sitcom. It was so bad that after seeing it for the third time (liked it the first time, soured on it the second, reviled it the last time) I swore I wouldn't see his next film... and to this day, I still haven't seen Punch Drunk Love.   He uses worn out tropes everywhere in the film, and they run into the worst, predictable plot points. The stand up, saint of a cop in John C. Reily falls for the junkie girl, tries to redeem her. Their dinner scene is atrocious, undercooked writing of emotions on the sleeve.   Tom Cruise is great, especially given how limited and predictable the character is. His womanizer is nothing special, as PTA chooses to go with a damaged man with daddy issues who sees redemption and acceptance in the guise of womanizing and hatred. Yes, we get it, he doesn't hate women, he hates himself.   Julianne Moore screams inanities instead of dialogue. He wrote such strong addict characters in Boogie Nights, but he writes her character as a shrill, one note housewife junkie.   I could rant about the characters for paragraphs, but let's focus on the film-making for the rest.   The camera movement is pure, unguided ambition. It's pointless tracking shot after steadicam shot. Do we really need to see multiple 2 minute plus shots of the quiz show? While I think there is something about the fragility of a kid dealing with adult pressures (being on the TV show), to have the crux of his emotional journey come down to bodily function and cowardice (get it, he's a kid!!!) instead of treating the younger quiz star as a child coping with problems above his mental capacity undercuts the intent of satirizing the sensationalist star factor of kids on TV.   There's also the part about the opening, one of the most enjoyable bits of prologue from the decade (although not original, as all of the stories are urban legends, most of which I read in a 90's book --something along the lines of ""Oops broiled again""), but there is absolutely no connection between the opening 10 minutes and the rest of the film. Yes, there is coincidence as a theme, but nothing on the scale of almost biblical tragedy in the intro.   I like the films almost operatic crests in emotion and pitch, it's dramatic, somber, swells with intensity and then has a denouement of sorts before ramping up again.. almost like there are multiple climaxes in the film. However, the actual content is so dull sometimes that I wind up being angry at the wasted effort as so little of value is produced from such talented hands. I hate the critiques of vanity the film tries to make as they feel so obvious and unearned. I hate the weak structure that tries to align wealth, misery, and broken families into a dissertation on actual values (and he tries to off play this with the good characters who get involved, like PSH as the caretaker).  This film stands as a testament to PTA's raw skill, but also to the slow nature of his genius. He, like Kubrick, needs years of reductive whittling in the creative process (meaning they are all about I don't know what I want, but I know what I don't want). Maybe it's telling that he was writing from a story of his own creation instead of adapting one (Boogie is based off John Holmes and a near rip off of Raging Bull, TWBB off Oil, and The Master of L. Ron Hubbard), which is why some of the logic may make sense to him in his vision, but fails to connect throughout.   Having one or two of the following would make sense, but not all of them: the motif of 82, the frogs, the gun going missing, the sing along, the prologue of coincidence. I don't critique the film for having those individually, it's just that films can't withhold so much loopiness unless the wild, visionary ambition is grounded in the story. For examples of where completely experimental, almost non nonsensical filmmaking works, see 2001, Tree of Life, Pierre le Fout, or even the climax of Close Encounters).   Ultimately, it's a visually stunning film that is as hollow and underwritten as the characters which inhabit the world.    Edit: cleaned up some sentences"
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,faultulence,3,Tue Jul 7 11:47:38 2015 UTC,"First, you should really see Punch Drunk Love as it's fantastic and if you are a fan of his other films then you will enjoy it quite a bit.  While I don't totally agree with your assessment of Magnolia, I do see a lot of validity for your distain.  It's certainly  a trope-y film and is lazy in that regard when compared to his other work.  I view it as a poor man's Short Cuts (which is a terrific Altman film from the 90s if you haven't seen it), a film I think had MAJOR influence on Magnolia.  Almost to the point that it feels like Magnolia is ripping it off.   It too involves stereotypical characters (which aren't always bad, tropes exist for very good reason) and, in the end, a ""miraculous"" conclusion.  So I'm not too sure about your assessment that Magnolia was entirely a project of PTA's own writing, with no major structural influence.  I really just think Magnolia is a director stuck in a place where he's got the talent, and now the notoriety of a terrific film (Boogie Nights), but doesn't know where to take it because of the outside influences effecting him at the time.  It's gotta be hard to be called a genius and not swallow a little bit of the cake you're being fed.  So to me, the film is still a very solid work by a generational talent who got a little full of himself but also was clearly unsure of how to live up to expectations.  I say this mainly because of the film's similarities to Short Cuts but also because of how convoluted and plodding it was as well.  Also, since every other film he's done, other than Magnolia, is basically a masterwork.    I think I read (or heard) an interview with him where he was saying he was having issues with his own father's death and/or dying at the time of writing and/or filming Magnolia so I can also understand how that would affect his work."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,Poolpe,3,Tue Jul 7 04:23:49 2015 UTC,"Couple of rapid fire notes -    Happy Cake day.  Seen Short Cuts, love it, and I remember the multiple allusions by PTA and critics in 99 when this came out. I also think of Nashville a lot, not only because of the flowing, interspliced narratives, but for the central location as a driving factor. Nashville is all about the music scene and the city, Magnolia is about the LA Valley... there is a resonance for PTA that I'm sure makes sense in his head, but it didn't make it on the screen.  PTA is on quite a streak... I haven't seen Inherent Vice yet (just had a kid, so yeah), but I can't wait.  I've toyed with seeing Punch Drunk. Many times. Was actually really excited when the project began, as it was rumored to be based upon this:    http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/the-denise-show/n10464   I don't know if it would have been a good film in the slightest, but there is something to be seen in a generational talent do a SNL movie."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,robbongo,3,Tue Jul 7 05:40:06 2015 UTC,"Cake Day already?  Time to delete the account and start anew.  Also, Inherent Vice is great, but not in the same vein as his former two films...at all.  lol  As for the Denise Show, I can very much see how that could influence PTA to cast Sandler.  You can see the underlying rage, that is so central to his character in Punch Drunk Love, constantly bubbling (and exploding) and Sandler has always had that shy, child like atmosphere to him ala his role in Airheads.  Man, now I need to go on a Sandler on SNL kick..."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,PunkMoon,2,Tue Jul 7 06:35:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with you too. While I don't really like any of the others either, when people tell me Magnolia is their favorite movie, or at least their favorite PTA movie, I'm always a little confused about what they see in it. I know how it gets to you on an emotional level but it doesn't add up to anything, and both looks and feels like something someone makes who's in too much of a hurry to make his personal masterpiece.   It doesn't provoke outright hatred from me, like a couple of other PTA movies do. I just find it really unsatisfying, especially for a three hour movie. At least a couple of those characters could have been interesting in a movie all their own."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,spaceparachute,8,Tue Jul 7 06:52:47 2015 UTC,"I don't wanna be that guy but I actually hate Magnolia. I think it's probably PTA's worst film, and generally I think he's a magnificent director.   I think what really sums up what irritates me about the film is a quote from PTA himself - he said something like ""I feel, for better or worse, that Magnolia is the best film I'll ever make."" The film feels like it's got this attitude stamped all over it. It's incredibly self-indulgent - the running time, the hundreds of characters, the vague ""people should try to connect with each other"" moral, the toning down of PTA's dark humour, the stupid fucking frogs thing. None of the characters are in any way as complicated as the movie seems to imply they are, and even if they were we wouldn't have time to learn about them because despite the colossal running time, we only get about 2 conversations to establish each person's character.  Everything about the movie aches with this burden of ""I'm a masterpiece."" It's as close, I think, that an inanimate object can get to being pretentious. There's plenty of good things about this film - lots of the performances are great (cruise, wow), the cinematography is standard PTA brilliance, some of the stories are pretty interesting, but I just can't appreciate it. The sense of self-importance clouds everything in a nauseating smog and just leaves me completely pissed off with the movie."
TrueFilm,3cdcgp,jawnkoffey,10,Wed Jul 8 05:14:28 2015 UTC,"I entirely get what you're saying. This movie is not a masterpiece but it acts like one. I personnaly think that PTA wanted to do too much with Magnolia. When you read the trivia around this movie, you find that PTA have put a lot of thoughts and stuff in this movie but sometimes it doesn't seems like it's justified. Also, he wanted all the stories to embrace Claudia's story. You only have to look at this picture to understand that the Show (and not Claudia) is the ""epicenter"" of this film.   the stupid fucking frogs thing   I do not completely agree about this part of your post. The ""frog thing"" is what makes this movie so great. During the whole movie, all the events seem to the same direction which is Chaos. And there is only one thing that can get everything ""right"", it's an event that gets everyone together. The frog part is necessary and, I am entirely sure about that, is an hommage to Robert Altman's Short Cuts' ending.  If you didn't watch it, go for it! You'll probably see PTA's Magnolia from a different and fresh perspective.  tldr: Magnolia isn't a masterpiece and watch Short Cuts immediately!"
TrueFilm,3cd37v,lordhadri,10,Mon Jul 6 23:43:41 2015 UTC,"Section I  Dear /u/montypython22,  Even after reading this essay several times over the last year, the thing that always strikes me first is how challenging Kael’s prose can be. Her sentences are wordy and her paragraphs are long.  and there’s only the illusion of structure. because it all comes across like a stream of consciousness from someone who likes to make abrupt digressions. Even after I got used to it I still find my eyes sliding across the page until they find a funny or important-sounding sentence. I suppose this must have been the intellectual match for the readership of the magazines she wrote for, but it reminds me less of how other critics write than how most people sound on internet forums: ridden with bad habits that I’m trying to identify and train myself out of.  Do you think Kael just predated the internet? Or does the influence perhaps run the other way: have the sort of people who like to write about movies on internet forums unknowingly adopted Kael’s tone and her way of writing openly personal reactions to movies from her and her imitators?  It’s not until the very end of Section I in a 15,000-word essay that Kael writes something like what schoolteachers call a ‘thesis statement:’   The romance of movies is not just in those stories and those people on the screen but in the adolescent dream of meeting others who feel as you do about what you’ve seen. You do meet them, of course, and you know each other at once because you talk less about good movies than about what you love in bad movies.   Well monty, here we are. We know very well that people are drawn to internet forums to discuss how bad Jurassic World is (#1 movie four weekends in a row), not to learn about Manoel de Oliveira. Does that make it more worth writing about? Is she right that sharing our experience with others matters more than a piece of art that exists on its own?"
TrueFilm,3cd37v,montypython22,8,Mon Jul 6 23:43:56 2015 UTC,"See, here's the thing. Aunt Pauline's rhetoric, no matter how much you agree or disagree with her (wildly controversial) opinions, is so much more than what it looks like. It looks like she's coming up with buzz-words on the fly, that stream-of-consciousness narrative that she spins all throughout ""Trash, Art, & The Movies"". But, for some reason or another, it works whenever she's writing them. Her putdowns, to me, aren't particularly witty nor are they totally uninsightful. They sound like a person who's seen a lot of movies and can't wait to tell you their gut instinct on what they feel. And that's really Kael's lasting legacy, and the thing I admire about her the most: her ability to tell cinephiles that it's okay if you're not an academic to seriously discuss what you think is terrific or terrible about a picture. Her style of writing favors the immediate response over the argumentative one. They're colorful pieces of prose, and it takes a couple of reads to understand where the hell she's going with her point. And much as I disagree with her particular opinions about certain films and her conclusions about what films should be, I really do admire her way of writing.   I just wish most of her followers and admirers were as verbose and hard-nosed as she was. She's not afraid to call out directors on their potential bullshit. Most other people, however, seem content with accepting the established classics of cinema without ever questioning them. She's always discarding movies that don't fit in with her way of seeing the world, which, according to ""Trash"", is one that favors crisp storytelling over flowery digressions.   There's very few people who are as galvanizing as Kael was. Armond White tries to set himself up to be that way, but he just comes off as a grand-standing troll, politicizing everything he sees fit and knowingly going against the grain of whatever's popular. Kael doesn't come off that way because she's not actively going against the critical mainstream; she's reacting in real time. Her reactions to movies (as detailed in her reviews) are in real-time."
TrueFilm,3cd37v,pursehook,6,Tue Jul 7 00:03:26 2015 UTC,"We're both familiar with the alternative, auteurist approach to creating canons that seems to dominate how the top few hundred movies are selected by conensus. The usual lists aren't too ridden with the unwatchable 'art' movies she's talking about, in my opinion. We also know the sorts of movies Kael loved were often very different from the stuff auteurists loved, and I must say it seems their favorites have held up better than hers over time. And auteurists have their own method of 'calling directors out on their bullshit' that often put someone like Andy Sarris at odds with Kael. It's fascinating to see which beloved movies they both disliked, though.  What she's laying out here is her case for why audiences go to poorly-made and/or lowbrow movies. Once again, the auteurists have their version of appreciating this kind of movie (they're looking for guys like Sam Fuller) but I think the reason Kael drives them crazy is because the argument she makes in 'Trash, Art, and the Movies' legitimizes the kind of stuff they wish audiences wouldn't watch and didn't obscure their favorite stuff from recognition. And it's easy to see how that influences what gets made too: Quentin Tarantino is a Kael disciple, and a lot of what's both great about him and terribly annoying about him comes from trying to live up to the sort of movies Kael calls trash. His commercial success proves her right.  I don't think anybody's going to make a career trying to please Armond White, though.  No, /u/pursehook, I haven't quite gotten to Schrader's essay about this yet."

It's hard to discount her point by saying the other guys won when her point is that the other guys are readily appealing to mass audiences despite their occasional pandering because they market themselves extremely well with empty visual affectations that appeal on a visceral level for their own sake.  Note: If she hadn't died four years before Reddit, I honestly would have thought she was writing a manifesto against /r/truefilm."

TrueFilm,3cd37v,hipsterparalegal,7,Tue Jul 7 12:40:53 2015 UTC,"Section II  Here, we have Kael make the controversial statement that she'd rather watch ""trash"" like The Scalphunters and Wild in the Streets than ""pretentious"" pseudo-art like 2001 or Petulia.   First off, though, has it occurred to anybody else that Kael not once defines what the hell she means by trash? She certainly describes the spectrum opposite of trash in fine detail, I suppose, but I never get a sense of what she means by trash beyond the two esoteric, forgotten examples she gives. Are B-movies trash? If so, does that make revered pulp auteurs like Sam Fuller trash? I was considering whether he would fit her definition, but after seeing Shock Corridor and White Dog, he doesn't fit in neatly to that monikor, either.  It occurs to me, too, how limited a critics' job is. One of a critic's main roles is to be a guide for their contemporaneous base of readers. They sort the good, the bad, and the ugly from each other, and tell people what they should spend their time looking into. Now, Aunt Pauline says:   ""Most of the films we enjoy today [i.e., in 1969] are not works of art.""   Well, now, how does one determine what constitutes art and what doesn't? As they say, one generation's trash is another's treasure. Again, to use the Fuller example again, what would have been considered pulpy schlock like the prostitute-do-gooder plot of The Naked Kiss and the mental-asylum-expose of Shock Corridor are now seen as powerful, metaphoric masterpieces today. Likewise, Kael brands stuff like The Graduate, 2001, and Petulia trash in disguise as art, but today, they have a long-lasting life where their claim to artistry is not even questioned. Of course they are; that's not the big question today, in contrast to Kael, who TRIES to make it an important but fails in this section  To me, that is where Kael's failures lie: in her ability to see beyond her narrow present, and to act in a non-prescient manner. She is so concerned with ""what makes art"" today and what doesn't, but this pressing matter of what makes art ""art"" is less of an issue than she makes it out to be. There are also many things she would have deemed ""trash disguised as art"" today (Petulia and 2001 are the most blatant examples) that are seen today as masterpieces, maligned works of art from the motion-picture industry that were misunderstood when they first came out.  But, then again, she does raise some good points about art-house pictures in any contemporaneous period and how we must be able to distinguish between those that are enlightening and those that are not. She talks of Petulia's ""kaleidoscopic hip look"" as a marker for its pseudo-artistic put-ons, In other words, she's basically describing her aversion to ""the gimmick"": something that gets a people in a given time-period to watch films that come out in that time period. Now,  this is something we can talk about, wouldn't you agree? ""Gimmick"" is a word that's thrown around a LOT, but I think we can use her concept of identifying what's popular in our current time-period and apply it to films on a general basis, so that we see what's truly original and what's merely, as she says it, a put-on. I'm thinking primarily of our modern obsession with long takes--everything in today's independent, art films MUST be all in one long fluid take, so we get abuses of it EVERYWHERE: from the obscure (The Tribe) to the mainstream (Birdman Or).   What do you think? Do you think this classification of what makes something art or not is worth pursuing in the films we watch today?  EDIT: Added some Fuller examples."
TrueFilm,3cd37v,BZenMojo,2,Tue Jul 7 00:23:28 2015 UTC,"Kael doesn't define what 'art' is, either. I think it must be more of a feeling, a mode of creation and communication that's identifiably different than something that pleases the crowd for money. She'll go on to explain why audiences don't really want to see something that stinks of art or school culture. But I never got a sense from this essay what kind of 'art' that she actually liked. 'Art' has always been hard to define, but so many people seem to be going in search of it and trying to come up with definitions to stick to. To someone else, whether or not 2001: A Space Odyssey is 'art' may not be the meaningful reason why they do or don't love it, anyway.   But even though this essay posits a distinction between 'art' and 'trash' and why there's a place in the movie world for both, it's not a distinction I find all that useful. For example, one thing I've been thinking about a lot lately is the legacy of ""the 1970s."" (Pause while angels blow trumpets.) The standard line on the 1970s were that they were a renewed period of creativity for American filmmaking that was betrayed by Michael Cimino and George Lucas. The 1970s films people are talking about have the airs of prestige and importance and 'art.' But the critics of the time, Kael included, weren't applauding everything that's treated as a masterpiece today. (We'll get to this again when we talk about her review of The Godfather.) And many critics were happy to become complicit in the downfall of the New Hollywood when they panned Heaven's Gate. Clearly, that sort of movie was not what they thought Hollywood's output should have been, as many people unquestioningly believe today.  The other big example you already brought up, which is B-Movies. I think most people would agree B-Features can be great movies, they're not automatically worse than A-Features. I'd rather watch Pickup on South Street again than Touch of Evil, for example. But even when B-Features aren't art, you can see why Kael would prefer them. She'd probably completely understand the audience's joy for Kingsman and it's ""church scene,"" and that's why Kingsman will make more money than The Tribe.  I can't wait to hear about The Scalphunters. She makes it sound like 21 Jump Street or something, I kinda don't want to spoil that impression.   I don't want to talk about gimmicks, it seems like a word you can hurl at anything. I'm more than happy to talk about The Prestige that way, for example, but if a movie I like is accused of that I'm gonna want to defend the alleged gimmick as a legitimate technique. It's probably like 'pretentious,' unanswerable and not really productive to bring up in dialogue."

But, your discussion (both of you) really suffers from a lack of context of the broader discussion around art in this time period.  This article was written in 1969.    For example, Pop art emerged in the early 60s and it was not at all immediately embraced.  Again, an example, Warhol's now-iconic Brillo Boxes were 1964, and I believe they didn't even sell at first.  The high/low discussion was going strong around visual art.  Seen in context, it is much more understandable what Kael is doing, or rather, why readers could connect.  (Kael might have been doing her criticism thing regardless.)"

This isn't always the case in her other essays, but we'll try to address that in time.  Kael generally wrote for an audience she expected to understand what she was talking about already. That makes her hard to understand today, it doesn't really work independent of the framework of the time, which can be hard to stitch together to many years later."

TrueFilm,3cd37v,braidonbuck,5,Tue Jul 7 23:28:34 2015 UTC,"Section IV  So much to talk about in this section, but I think I’ll take chief offence at the first argument:  The Argument   Much like a child seeing a movie for the first time who to have their fun burst by their parents who want to “explain” away the “genius” aspects of the film, we watch foreign movies and give them more credit than they’re due. That’s because when we’re seeing something in a foreign language, it’s new and exciting to us. And if it reminds us of our own mother culture, we’re bound to see more in it than the culture from where the film is coming from. (She gives specific examples, such as the “Italian sex comedies” of Pietro Germi and, more importantly, The Young Girls of Rochefort, which I’ll get to shortly.) But not to worry, says Kael! They weren’t that important to begin with, so they’ll never be overpraised more than the corrupt “pseudo-art” films like 2001 and Petulia.   Kael comes off as needlessly belittling in this section, as she just stops herself short of saying, “I’m above you because I can tell the difference between when a foreign-film is actually original and when a foreign-film is doing things that have been done better before.”  Her comparison to viewers of such films as children is pretty toxic. This, especially considering the time period: it was incredibly hard for foreign films to play in popular theatres. Whenever an “arthouse” foreign film caught on fire and made its rounds in bigger, non-arthouse circuits(as did Antonioni’s L’avventura, Fellini’s 8½, Resnais’s The Last Year at Marienbad, etc.) it was a cause for celebration. (Note, too, that the above I’ve mentioned were all films that Kael panned.) That Kael thinks it appropriate to imbue this section with that measure of subtle “I’m right-you’re wrong”-itis is testament to one of her main goals in her fiery film criticism: piss off as many people as possible, sometimes without good reason.**   And she doesn’t even do a good job of explaining herself and her points. In what is one of her more pointless observations, she writes:   “I suppose a miserable American movie musical like Pal Joey might look good in France because I can’t think of a single good dance number performed by French dancers in a French movie. The French enjoy what they’re unable to do and we enjoy the French studies of the pangs of adolescent love that would be corny if made in Hollywood. A movie like The Young Girls of Rochefort demonstrates how even a gifted Frenchman who adores American musicals can misunderstand their conventions.”   Understanding the conventions of a genre is besides the point. To say that a distinct group of people ""know"" the genre and others don't is a very reductive way of thinking about movies.  Having read a lot of critical texts on Demy and his motivations behind Rochefort, and having seen the film an ungodly amount of times, I can say that Kael herself misunderstands the point of films like Demy’s Demoiselles. Demy isn’t trying to exactly recapture the magic of Hollywood musicals in a Minnellian or Donen-like tradition the way Kael thinks he is; he’s drawing on the Hollywood musicals, yes, but he’s not copying them—he’s making something entirely new and more French than American. An American screenwriter for a musical by Donen would never pepper the film with as many coincidences and fated encounters as Demy does in his film. Kael is dealing with a film that works at a level different from what she’s accustomed to seeing. A movie like Rochefort has imperfect dancing and people jarringly transitioning between song to song because it wants to combine, not separate, two traditions: a postmodernist art context (which daringly combines the high [i.e., metaphysical opera] and low [i.e., Hollywood big-budget quickies] arts) and an Hollywood studio musical fantasy.   Kael, on the other hand, is obsessed with separating traditions. As she says in this section (and in her own words, mind you), “it is relevant to an understanding of movies to try to separate out, for purposes of discussion at least, how we may personally use a film...from what makes it a good movie or a poor one.” This is alright in order to see why a film functions, but at the end of the day, we don’t really CARE to separate between these two distinctions. A film’s use is its good parts. At the end of the day, they are utterly inseparable.  Also, her comments on 2001 working only as a “trip” movie are very unfair, since she uses a highly selected group of people that we love to ridicule (the hippies) to dismantle a film, instead of addressing people’s arguments for WHY 2001 is so great.   **For more on this art-house cinema and its rise, see David Bordwell's wonderful essay ""The Art Cinema as a Mode of Film Practice""."
TrueFilm,3cd37v,BZenMojo,3,Tue Jul 7 03:05:21 2015 UTC,"Section III  This section on movie technique the most quotable of the whole essay in my opinion, so I think I'm going to repeat a few choice lines and add commentary:   ""Movies make hash of the schoolmarm’s approach of how well the artist fulfilled his intentions.""   I was never taught it quite that way in school but I hear it all the time now. These days it's common to see people take this approach to defend movies that are not made by artists. If a major blockbuster is mediocre but solidly entertaining, it 'fulfilled it's intentions,' and is therefore rated the same as much better movies that also 'fulfill their intentions.'   I've always felt this was a 'misconception' too, and Kael explains where it comes from:   ""People who are just getting “seriously interested” in film always ask a critic, “Why don’t you talk about technique and ‘the visuals’ more?” The answer is that American movie technique is generally more like technology and it usually isn’t very interesting.""   Half a century later we've seen that march toward technology reach its logical destination. Hand-drawn animation was replaced by software, photography has been digitized and integrated with CGI. Looked at it like Kael sees it, it was always going to happen that way for American filmmaking, from Griffith onward. But usually there's no technique to it, no art.  Sure, she generalizes it as 'American' technique, but that's a fair generalization for most mainstream American movies. And it's understandable why people prefer to see something in English with pop culture references they know over whatever European import is supposed to have talent and integrity behind it.    ""Hollywood movies often have the look of the studio that produced them—they have a studio style. Many current Warner films are noisy and have a bright look of cheerful ugliness,""   Still true. (Interstellar, Man of Steel.)   ""Universal films the cheap blur of money-saving processes""   Still true. (Jurassic World, Furious 7)   ""Technique is hardly worth talking about unless it’s used for something worth doing""   This is a thorny issue but I think she's probably right. The best directors aren't just great stylists, they're good storytellers too. And the most decisive movies from a great director are the ones that had the best stories, even for people who appreciate them for their technique. It's why The Searchers is a better movie than Sergeant Rutledge and why virtually everyone prefers Fight Club to The Game. But it doesn't explain everything, either. Christopher Nolan is technically bland but has a huge following. Zack Snyder is technically better, but isn't a very good storyteller, yet he can get by on spectacle alone. I think it's because when (cheap) expensive-technological movies get made people will go even if they don't like in the end, and Kael has thoughts about why that is too.    ...""if you could see the “artist’s intentions” you’d probably wish you couldn’t anyway. Nothing is so deathly to enjoyment as the relentless march of a movie to fulfill its obvious purpose.""   Whenever I see a movie that I feel like I ought to like but don't, I hear those words in my head now."
TrueFilm,3cd37v,montypython22,6,Tue Jul 7 01:52:02 2015 UTC,"Minor note: I looooooove how she starts off this section with the phrase ""Let's clear away a few misconceptions""....and proceeds to complicate everything.  But yes, I totally am on board with Kael's schoolmarm argument. We grow up relatively clueless about movies; it's only when we start watching MORE of them that we begin to develop what can be called ""tastes"" or ""preferences"" or what have you. Kael righteously points out, though, that much too often, we'll rely too much on high-school-level analyses to justify movies that don't deserve them. I'm sure that if we take ANY movie, we can squeeze it out for all of its arbitrary and unintentional subtext. Kael says that one has to figure out (for themselves!) where the fine line between depth and banality lies, the thin line where one either decides to go deeper and probe for deeper meanings hidden in a film that the director INTENTIONALLY wants you to probe (i.e., 2001), or just stay at the surface because the film doesn't deserve to be probed deeper.  I think she also points out a crucial caviat against the auteur theory: that every single gesture in the technique is intentional by the director. Not EVERYTHING has to be like this. Great, happy accidents occur all the time on the set; an auteur's great idea on paper may be scratched once production-time rolls along because it's not feasible. (Think back, for instance, of Fincher's disastrous first-desire to start off The Social Network with a score that was reminiscent of a John Hughes movie.) I read somewhere that she asked Sidney Lumet if she could visit the set of his latest movie while he was directing it, so that she could get a sense of how filmmaking works as a critic. That's the kind of practicality I admire in Kael; she's not merely content with staying as a meek observer to a finished product and noting what she thinks is the director's intentions. At least for the movies she likes (like Bonnie and Clyde and The Godfather), she actively tries to understand the craft that went into making it.    It occurs to me, again, that her general statements--i.e., whenever she doesn't mention specific films--have greater weight than her statements when she recklessly lashes into every film with nifty one-liners that never gel (see my Rochefort rant below). That first paragraph, for instance, is golden. The Petulia section is not.  (Speaking of Petulia, I know we're not on that section yet, but I think I know why she hates Lester so much. Lester is most definitely a TV-bred director, interested in using the techniques of that age's commercials to make his films visually exciting. Whereas Kael....well, we need only read this little morsel to see what Kael thinks of the aesthetic of the TV commercial:   Technique is hardly worth talking about unless it’s used for something worth doing: that’s why most of the theorizing about the new art of television commercials is such nonsense. The effects are impersonal—dexterous, sometimes clever, but empty of art. It’s because of their emptiness that commercials call so much attention to their camera angles and quick cutting—which is why people get impressed by “the art” of it.    Of course, Lester is aware of this, but Kael isn't. (More on that later.)"
TrueFilm,3cd37v,sbroue,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:30:55 2015 UTC,"Section V  The big thing I want to talk about here is how Kael uses examples of movies, because she namedrops a ton of them in this section. It's almost always a reference to something she thinks I should have heard about but I don't, because I'm not from 1969. It doesn't help that a lot of them are supposed to be examples of 'trash' and thus trash is what they were once pop culture no longer had any use for them. To write lasting criticism we do have to try not to make too much of what's briefly sensational or a hot topic for only as long as the movie's in theaters. But to fully understand what Kael's trying to say you need to not just understand the film culture of the time, but also recognize at least some of the deprecated and forgotten movies she's talking about. And she rarely mentions a movie in order to develop it into an example that makes me want to go see it, like Sarris does.   Sure it's fun to find out something like Wild in the Streets or There's a Girl in My Soup exists but I'm not about to go looking for them.  Another thing about the essay that holds me at a distance are her attacks on school-approved culture, something she often did in her writing. maybe teaching changed because I can't really remember being taught 'art' at all, not of the sort she writes about. Video brought movies into the classroom but only ever for literature purposes, and even then, to let the screen supervise 'learning' so the teacher could take a break from trying to explain Romeo and Juliet or whatever.   Film culture changed too. When she talks about movies being an unsupervised, liberating experience: television took on that role. I don't ever just go to a movie. It's too risky. So it's always an obligation these days, once I've decided it's something I'm gonna see. Extemporaneous movie choices are reserved for the home screen. Kael wrote about that too, maybe we should cover her movies on television essay?"
TrueFilm,3cd37v,hipsterparalegal,2,Tue Jul 7 06:08:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she seems to think that academia takes the fun out of watch films, when really it has quite the opposite effect.

That seems preposterous."
TrueFilm,3cc94j,FightOnSc7,14,Mon Jul 6 20:01:12 2015 UTC,"i really love this film and i think the odd atmosphere adds a lot to it. while it's following some sort of formula with cliche characters and corny lines, it also has grizzly murders, brutal violence and extended sex scenes. you're right, it also uses the ""fakeness"" as a plot point with mortensens character, but. at the end of the day, i feel like it just suits the film. if it was just one character, it'd be really awkward. but it just approaches their world in an interesting way, all distorted, kind of lynch like i guess. i don't view it as a real world, i just view it as the world this movie takes place in. i'm sure it throws a lot of people off, but it's never really bothered me very much. i still find myself watching it regularly : )"
TrueFilm,3cc94j,vulpecu,7,Mon Jul 6 21:04:09 2015 UTC,"Excellent film. And while I get why you're saying, I don't look for too much psychological reality in cinema. Even realistic drama takes place in a heightened reality. Esp. in a film like this, which is a parable about violence. It's not designed to be a psychological character study. Its characters are archetypes with a veneer of realism.  I suppose if that's not your kind of thing... then it's not. But I feel that it's a perfectly valid style of filmmaking -- and storytelling in general. To prioritize theme above psychological realism. This is, essentially, modern fabulism. Today's equivalent of legends and folk tales. The film tells one man's story, but it's really telling a more universal story about the consequences of a life of violence.  Unlike most folk tales, however, its treatment of the ""hero"" is more ambiguous. The film doesn't leave us with easy answers, only suggesting that a life of violence leaves behind consequences that a person can never truly shake off. It's a deeply cynical film, which I very much appreciate. We've gotten so used to redemption stories that it's almost startling when a film foregoes such an arc. While Tom Stall receives grudging acceptance in the film's conclusion, he has not been let off the hook. His lie, now exposed, can't ever be covered up again, and things will never go back to the way they were before. And while that's Stall's particular story, it resonates with countless other stories of people who've tried to leave behind their violent past."

Witness his ease and familiarity with killing the kidnappers, and his awareness and care to avoid the cameras. Leaving that life by inventing a new person was, apparently, the only option available to him.  He wasn't hiding himself from his family, but rather his history. Who hasn't lied to mask past mistakes and make new friends? To what extent does the past inform who we are in the present, anyway?  Are you the same person when placed in completely different circumstance? Most people would say not. Is choosing to change your circumstance deceitful? It raises quite deep ideas all whilst couched in the idea of family and coming of age ... yes, V. Mortensen is lead but I might argue that the story is actually about the son - he is trying to find his own identity and seemingly progressing in this respect, only to have his world view upended. Perhaps the film suggests that coming to know your own self is the realisation that you can never really know the people around you?  I highly rate this film. The violence was sudden and unexpected, shocking ... but not gratuitous - punctuary, especially with the pacing of the film. The acting was very subtle. The script was understated, allowing the actors to work and the atmosphere to build. The camera work and layout complimented it all. I might have made the gangsters less organised - I like that the Viggo character survived, and I liked a another demonstration of his prowess ... but killing a dozen men with his bare hands (or however many) didn't add much and the feeling could have been achieved better. Yes - we needed to feel the emotional reluctance of killing his brother (because he still loves him) but also the clarity of the choice (his past or his family), and there needed to be some build up ... but I suspect much of it was designed to please action junkies and help advertising, etc.  The sex scene in the stairs is one of the most raw and powerful things I've seen emerge from Hollywood. It still affects me... the struggle and the resentment that can foster within a relationship, the indifference, almost ... taking each other for granted. Was that the first time they'd really seen / met each other?   I suppose what I like most about the film is that it poses questions without casting judgement."

The fact that his own brother tried to kill him in that setting after all that time - with such little exposé, seemed very haphazardly strung together. The actual buildup to the reveal in Philadelphia was interesting, but in the end it was very uninteresting and anti-climactic.  Also, the overall reaction of his family, especially his son, had very few believable moments, either because they were so rushed or underdeveloped.  I'm no big film buff so I'm a bit light on examples, but I think films like Gone Girl, Gran Torino and Enemy explored the dichotomy of characters much better, albeit in a different settings."
TrueFilm,3cc94j,terrorobe,-1,Mon Jul 6 21:10:46 2015 UTC,"The first half of the film was really great. The mystery surrounding who he was in a past life. And then after his secret is revealed I just stopped caring. ""Oh, is that it?"" was my reaction. And the final climactic scenes were just meh to me."
TrueFilm,3cc0gd,atclubsilencio,5,Mon Jul 6 19:02:49 2015 UTC,"One of my favourites of the year. With some of the more abstract imagery at the end I found it to be a capper on the themes the film was dealing with as these women get coiled to their tightest. The whole thing is a back and forth of desire and abetting a desire that gets pushed too far by the end. There is repeated imagery of moths and the study of moths and I found this to be a representation of Evelyn's own fascination with control and order. All these moths have their specific function, their unique tones, all with their own defining patterns. She too knows exactly what she wants and is probing the limits of her and Cynthia's relationship in attempts to discover her specific ways.   But by the end Cynthia has given up too much. All relationships rely on compromises that can range from peeing on your partner cause they want it to letting them watch the game on Sundays. When Evelyn stops just focusing on her own needs and looks into Cynthia's she sees that everything's on the edge of falling apart. Things have become so skewed to Evelyn's passions that her partner's almost become alien to her. Rather than being like a moth that she understands and can appreciate for it's particularities Cynthia has become unreadable as the skewed dynamic has strained her so much.   Then on Cynthia's side we see the fear she's wracked with and now she gets no pleasure in fulfilling Evelyn's pleasures as she has become more of a source of stress than a companion. Rather than getting the simple delight of waking next to the one she loves she has to get her from a box with the fear she might not have survived the night.   So the whole end sequence felt like a symbolic and emotional representation of where both their minds are at. Showing for both how they've learned to pull things back a bit. One always has to give a little in a relationship, but give too much and you both get lost.   Though Berberian Sound Studio did open up a little on re-watch this definitely feels like the more complete film. What I love about Strickland's version of homage is that he really captures the look and feel of the films he's riffing off (giallo, 70s eurorotica) without just being a pastiche. They're fully his films even though he's drawing so much from other films. Berberian Sound Studio doesn't have some of the flat characters/performances of classic Giallo and Duke of Burgundy for all its sensuality is never leering and isn't a film that makes you think of the male gaze unlike its predecessors. He's found a voice through his influences in a way I feel like I rarely see so I'm excited for whatever he does."
TrueFilm,3cc0gd,a113er,3,Mon Jul 6 22:55:38 2015 UTC,"I think the moth imagery compliments not only Evelyn's need to control, but also her desire to be wrapped up or held. All of her scripted abuses involved smothering or confinement of some sort. The moths near the end completely envelope her, but with the danger of some loss of control. Poor Cynthia has been doing all of the holding, waiting for it to grow into something else, but Evelyn's too focused on her own fulfillment to ever get there. In the end, she cares enough for Evelyn that she's willing to accept that imbalance.  Isn't this the sweetest, most tender movie ever to involve someone peeing into someone else's mouth? I think so."
TrueFilm,3cc0gd,LuigiVanPeebles,2,Mon Jul 6 23:27:57 2015 UTC,I loved the film as well and also felt that a lot of the imagery was cryptic. One thing I thought was clear was that the ending wasn't a flashback. To me it was clear from Cynthia's resigned facial expression that it was the next summer and that they had fallen back on they're old patterns.
TrueFilm,3cc0gd,LancasterDodd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:58:08 2015 UTC,"Interesting, so would you call the beginning a flash forward?  It's also shown three times but in different context. I'm assuming it's to show different perspectives? First time we see it from Evelyn's POV, then Cynthia, the once again at the end. But I guess they did repeat certain parts over and over, so it could be just that."
TrueFilm,3cc0gd,LancasterDodd,2,Mon Jul 6 20:07:28 2015 UTC,You could but I don't think it really matters where the beginning is chronologically as the whole point seemed to be that the scenario were seeing gets repeated regularly. What I think the movie is getting at is that compromise is the key to a relationship and so after showing them getting rid of the chest and acquiescing to Cynthia's discomfort it then showed her begrudgingly accepting the continuation of the master as servant routine.
TrueFilm,3cc0gd,graysontylerjohnson,2,Mon Jul 6 20:25:20 2015 UTC,"My interpretation is that the film explores the thin relationship between pet and master, of high and low class, through the context of female sexuality (though it's written by a male).  Cynthia gets off on being withholding, domineering and abusive and Evelyn finds pleasure in being submissive and a concubine under Cynthia's thumb. It is a symbiotic relationship, until Cynthia comes down too hard on Evelyn, or Evelyn retreats too far into her submissiveness (the trunk), and it throws their love out of balance. Cynthia finds she needs Evelyn, their roles reverse, and it doesn't work, though at the end, they fall back into balance.  To me the moths represented Evelyn, low class by birth. A moth not a butterfly.  And thus Cynthia's academic obsession with them bleeds into her obsession with Evelyn. The long zoom into Cynthia's vagina was, to me, showing how her power came from her sexual dominance over Evelyn, and Evelyn's obsession with that dominance.  It is a thin line that makes opposites, a thin line between sex and power, and a thin line between where Cynthia ends and Evelyn begins.  I feel like I had more thoughts on the movie when I saw it but it was some months ago.  I hope others have different interpretations, because I feel like there could be a lot of readings.  I also really enjoyed it.  Also, I really loved some of the comedic elements.  The long tracking shot of the lepidopterists (whoa) listening to the moth noises cracked me up.  Definitely agree that the sound design was impressive to say the least."

No men are ever seen, and we are never really given much insight into where this takes place. What threw me off the most, and is my biggest question is what was the deal with the mannequins in the lectures. At first I thought I was imagining it, but there is at least on dressed up mannequin in every shot of the audience during the lectures. Does anybody have any clue what the meaning of this could be?"
TrueFilm,3cc0gd,NitratePrint,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:52:16 2015 UTC,"Duke of Burgundy was conceived as a remake of Jess Franco's Lorna the Exorcist.

TrueFilm,3cd4ix,White_Thundur,35,Mon Jul 6 23:53:49 2015 UTC,"A great many actors play versions of themselves, and as long as that suits the role, I have no problem with it. People often believe that acting is meant to be a transformational. That's one approach, famously embodied by Method actors. But it is hardly the only approach to acting. I've studied acting myself, and there are schools that favor playing roles as shades of yourself -- not yourself exactly, but a different character that is nevertheless not too far removed from who you are.  That's an equally valid approach to acting -- whatever works for you, and all that -- and if we limited our pool of actors only to those who go by The Method, we'd be depriving ourselves of a lot of talent.  That said, I think Jackson is a fine actor, and anyone who doubts that should watch his performance in Django Unchained. Also, check him out as Ordell in Jackie Brown, it's a performance with a different vibe from his other roles."
TrueFilm,3cd4ix,strangenchanted,3,Tue Jul 7 02:01:13 2015 UTC,"I believe that to be correct in general, but when it comes to Sam L., I actually think he has a lot of variety. He's famous for playing the bad-ass like in Pulp Fiction, which he plays with variations often, yet he's also shown himself as rather capable in other roles.  If we were to put his roles in Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained, Unbreakable, Kingsmen, The Red Violin, Jurassic Park, and even Star Wars (Mace Windu was never the problem with those films, imo), I'd say he's more than shown that he's capable of other roles than just the one. Even as a voice actor he has tremendous talent, and that isn't all that easy."

See:  Pulp Fiction  Jackie Brown  The Sunset Limited  Hard Eight  Jurassic Park  Django Unchained  Kingsman: The Secret Service  Unbreakable  ...and then suggest that he always plays the same guy, because those performances are about as different from one another as you can get."

Here's a little detail about his role in Jungle Fever   After previously overdosing on heroin several times, Jackson gave up the drug in favor of cocaine. After seeing the effects of his addiction, his family entered him into a New York rehab clinic. When he successfully completed rehab, Jackson appeared in Jungle Fever, as a crack cocaine addict, a role which Jackson called cathartic as he was recovering from his addiction. Jackson commented on the transition, ""It was a funny kind of thing. By the time I was out of rehab, about a week or so later I was on set and we were ready to start shooting.""The film was so acclaimed that the 1991 Cannes Film Festival created a special ""Supporting Actor"" award just for him.   Clip  Unbreakable may be worth checking out from some quick research, but there are many actors like this: Morgan Freeman is an older wise man, Hugh Grant is a suave British gentleman, and so on. Michael Cera had to actively work to get out of that typecasting - he intentionally pushed what he was allowed to do in This is The End because he was fed up of being the virginal teenager role."

They are basically typecast for most of their careers or just don't have a desire to branch out and really get into a character like say Gary Oldman or Daniel Day Lewis does, where sometimes it's hard to tell who you're even seeing on screen. I get the feeling Jackson is just most comfortable in those roles.  Really, he has done some great films but in the grand scheme of things he's not that great of an actor. Pulp Fiction, A Time to Kill, Django Unchained, and The Red Violin are probably the only films where I thought he really shined."

Also in PTA's early gem Hard Eight he plays a bigger role but isn't nearly what we've come to know (though you can see him revving up). Also in Do The Right, when he was, as Spike makes a big effort to point out, still just going by Sam Jackson, NOT Samuel L. Jackson (I always thought this might be a very subtle way of one upping Tarantino but I don't know when made the switch fro. Sam Jackson to Samuel L. Jackson. In any case, after Pulp he was definitely known as the latter), he plays perhaps a happier though no less loquatious version of the character we've come to know. Here he is more solidified into what he would become post Pulp Fiction, but it's played in a very different key."
TrueFilm,3cb26q,hydra815,6,Mon Jul 6 14:49:59 2015 UTC,"I took it as another stepping stone for Iran to show the world that they're continuing their climb out of the ""oppressing women"" pit.   The girl in the movie supports the boy almost entirely throughout. He has a problem with the pimp, she handles it. He has a problem with his dad, she handles it. He has a tough time getting home on drugs, she handles it.  I can't be 100% on this next part, but do we only see her kill guys who sort of force themselves onto girls?"
TrueFilm,3cb26q,HungOnGravity,3,Mon Jul 6 17:47:43 2015 UTC,"I also took it as that! IIRC for most of the post though. I've only seen it once and it was quite some time ago.  I know she was striving for more style and atmosphere but for me I can definitely see the perspective that the underlying theme for the film is feminism. Although she says she did not try to make it feminist, I can see tones of it as a woman, the vampire Girl, was the only figure of true power in the film and it was her morals that the other characters had to live or be punished by (morals that are mostly hinged on treatment of women as she kills men who do disrespect women and on the flipside, treats Arash equally because he respects her). The choice of styling also for the Girl can be read as feminist. Throughout the whole film, she is the one in power and yet none of her appearance is masculine. She wears red lipstick, eyeliner, and a chabor, all typically feminine traits. In reality, there's a disparate difference in the number of men in power and women in power. Men are associated with power rather than women and there's the oft-cited comparison of ""when men act assertively, they're bosses, but when women do, they're bitches"". But here's the Girl who's unapologetically feminine and in power in Bad City, unafraid of what others think of her. As contrast to the Girl though there is Atti, the prostitute, who is in the submissive position in Bad City, an example of the demeaning reality that many women are forced to live.  I read an article that the chabor that she wears is a symbol of empowerment, choice, and living by her own moral code. With that symbol and the scene of her attacking the homeless man, from a feminist perspective, it can be read that even women with good intentions can break their moral codes with their behavior and hinder their pursuit of equality (women who call themselves feminists and give it a bad name). Her returning to her vampire quality can be seen as a return to a woman's ""internalized misogyny"" (behavior such as ripping other women down for the affection of a man, or dissing another woman for her sex life and habits, etc.) which I'm sure women have if they've grown up in a typical patriarchal and sexist society. When the Girl polices herself and resists killing out of just hunger, she becomes more than just a vampire. She becomes a vigilante hero. When a woman resists acting upon her internalized misogyny and fights for equality, she is more than a woman, she becomes a supporter and ally of women.  Sorry if I lost some people there, by bringing up feminist concepts that aren't exactly popular (patriarchy! internalized misogyny!) and if my analysis of the homeless man scene seems like a stretch.   Personally, it's a vampire film to me that has feminist undertones (but I wouldn't think it's as overt as say Mad Max: Fury Road) and I can see that she really didn't decide to make it as such (like the homeless man scene). But I can't deny that it's pretty damn feminist to have a vigilante vampire punishing men who disrespect women."
TrueFilm,3cb26q,dearsadako,2,Tue Jul 7 10:32:44 2015 UTC,"but do we only see her kill guys who sort of force themselves onto girls?   It had seemed like it was on that track, but there is a scene where she attacks and eats a homeless man without any context, from what I recall. On the flip side, she does make the young boy promise to never hurt women when he grows up."
TrueFilm,3cb26q,LuigiVanPeebles,3,Mon Jul 6 18:01:14 2015 UTC,"Thematically, this movie came up a little short for me. I caught it a few weeks ago, and has continued to pop up in my head since then, so it made some positive impression, but I think its assets were more stylistic than narrative.  One recurring theme seemed to be exploitation and/or expendability... I'm not happy with either of those words exactly, but will try to explain. The movie shows us drug dealers, pimps, oil pumps, and a pit of bodies. It created an environment in which things are used up and thrown away, without concern. The Girl partly mirrors that. She feeds on her surroundings the same way everyone else does, only the damage from her feeding is a little more immediate.  Both her and Arash want to get out of this cycle. They are a part of it, but maybe Arash doesn't have the strength or the willpower to get out on his own. Maybe the Girl just needs a reason, and Arash provides that. Maybe he's just something new to use up. Honestly, this is where it left me wanting a little more. I got more from the backdrop than I did the main storyline. The romance angle seemed plugged in, and out of sync with the other themes. Or it could be that I'm just misreading it.  The director did a Q&A after the screening I attended, but she wasn't really into going into the themes. She spent more time talking about LSD. There were only a few direct questions as to the themes of the movie, and she dodged those with glib or witty comments. She did emphasize the existence of the body pit, though, without elaborating."
TrueFilm,3cb26q,LuigiVanPeebles,4,Mon Jul 6 17:05:29 2015 UTC,"I thought the romance was actually the point of the whole thing. All of the characters are lonely in some way, Hossein is so broken up about his wife's death that he does nothing but heroin, Atti won't talk to him unless he's paying her. The pimp mentions to her that she's getting old, but she doesn't have any kind of family and it's hinted at that she's saving up to move away. The Girl maintains distance between her and everyone else because she's bored with immortality, and also feels guilt about what she does to survive. Arash's attempts to connect with the rich girl at the party are rebuffed.   I think it's that despair and loneliness that connects the two of them. They both feel like outsiders in a way that puts them on the same level, away from everyone else, so they escape together. I guess I kind of see myself in both of the characters, though, so I may be projecting that onto them. I think that's what really shines about this movie for me, though, is that the characters are fleshed out enough to be real characters but still open enough to reflect the audience in some way."
TrueFilm,3cb26q,thezennihilist,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:23:28 2015 UTC,"Huh. Yeah, okay, that approach clicks with me a little more than the direction I was going. I can see that coming through in the imagery I described above with that perspective. I guess what I had initially seen as exploitation might have actually been everyone's attempts at coping with or breaking through their own loneliness. And what looks more lonely than an oil pump bobbing away endlessly in an empty desert?  Any thoughts on the body pit, or was it just there for tone?"
TrueFilm,3cb26q,LuigiVanPeebles,3,Mon Jul 6 21:19:37 2015 UTC,"I thought it was more for setting/tone than anything else. It really reinforces the idea that Bad City has decayed to the point where there's an open mass grave that people walk by without reacting. I suppose it could kind of indirectly reinforce the theme of loneliness, in that there's clearly no effective police force and it's a dog eat dog society of isolated individuals, but that may be a stretch.   The seemingly throwaway details are what I love about this movie, I think it's a huge credit to Amirpour that she can use just a few seconds of footage like that to simultaneously create a setting and tone through mere implication, while also raising questions that draw you into that setting."
TrueFilm,3cb26q,thezennihilist,2,Mon Jul 6 21:49:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure there's really supposed to be a deeper subtext with this film. It's drenched in loneliness and despair, but I don't know if it really says anything about those emotions other than exploring the unique connection that outsiders from a common group can sometimes have. I suppose there's also some 'not everything is black and white' kind of stuff going on, there's clearly terrible people involved but even Arash's thoughtfulness is balanced by his theft of the earrings, and The Girl occupies a very moral grey area. I feel no sympathy for the two major characters she kills, but I have to wonder what the homeless man did, if anything, to warrant getting vamped.   I loved the film, but mostly for technical reasons (The sound design and lighting are works of art in and of themselves), as well as some characterization choices. I think Amirpour has an incredible talent for conveying character through non-verbal cues, and I cannot wait to see more from her or Sheila Vand (That woman's eyebrows are more expressive than most actors I can think of right now)."
TrueFilm,3cb26q,thezennihilist,2,Mon Jul 6 20:38:39 2015 UTC,"I'll admit that I didn't dissect the movie enough to deserve a response but, at least from a shallow interpretation, the movie didn't seem to have any depth in either moral themes, canon, or even characters really. Based on the director's quotes, I think my initial opinion is validated - seems that she wanted it to be an ""experience"", a piece of cinema that washes over you that you take at face value.  Personally, I'm not a huge fan of stuff like this though. On a spectrum of blockbuster to avant-garde art-house, this falls a little too far on the latter end for my tastes. I think she did a great job as a new director crafting extremely compelling visual and audio, but this whole notion of forsaking traditional story-telling strikes me as a bit lazy and why I don't really view this movie as amazing.  I too immediately compared this movie to a Jarmusch film, especially Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai, but I think Jarmusch successfully tells coherent stories with unique filming so it's not impossible to combine the two."
TrueFilm,3cb26q,HeyItsMau,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:30:18 2015 UTC,"I watched this movie some weeks ago, and while I thought some things were executed better than others, I remember one thing sticking out to me the most: the atmosphere. Perhaps most of it could be attributed to the gray scale palette, the lack of color perhaps making it less reality (the world is of course not in black and white) the sense of dread was there, unfamiliarity perhaps. As for the subtext in regards to this, I remember seeing a statement by Amirpour describing the slow dance scene when our two leads are alone together, i.e. the male lead slowly closing behind the vampire seeking embrace, as being a scene showcasing not two, but three characters. The boy, the vampire, and the space between them. I took this as a showcasing of polarity between the boy and vampire. The black and white. A human and a vampire. Two opposing ideals seeking a stronger bond perhaps. Or just showing just how different these two are from one another, and that because of it they could never be together.  There is still one scene that seems really out of place for me, and it may be because there's something I'm not understanding it. It is the scene later on in the movie with the woman dancing in a lot. It seemed a little too self-indulgent to me, getting the art house feel for the sake of it. This dark world of a vampire is not so dark, there is beauty in it as well - this woman dancing?"
TrueFilm,3cb26q,farronstrife,2,Mon Jul 6 18:02:46 2015 UTC,"I know it sounds quite vague, but I always saw the dancing woman and the balloon as a metaphor for the two protagonists. The balloon I initially read as The Girl, as she repeatedly tries to ""fly away"" from the commitment of the potential relationship between her and Arash (and maybe distance and detach herself entirely from the world), but Arash acts as a grounding influence on her.  I didn't really get anything particularly profound from it, but it's a neat visual metaphor that for me established the tone of the relationship the film was building up towards."
TrueFilm,3cb26q,SoWest,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:49:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it's a particularly deep film and I'm also not sure that Amirpour really meant it to mean much of anything. I'm sure she has some thematic occupations as a director but it's hard to know what they are since she only has one feature in her filmography. The Lynch comparison is an interesting one and visually I understand it, but Lynch's film's also have a lot of thematic depth to them whereas A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night just doesn't. If anything, it reminded me a bit of Upstream Color where it's more about a visual experience than trying to follow a coherent plot or become invested in interesting characters. That being said, I think Carruth does a better job of that because of how incredible the score is and how confident he is as a director. I think that's the big thing I took away from A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night. Amirpour is clearly a talented director and I'm excited to see what she does next, but the film lacks confidence. It's an Iranian vampire movie/spaghetti western shot in black in white with some fantasy elements and avant-garde flourishes thrown in for good measure. It almost feels like a student film because it seems like Amirpour chose to try a little bit of everything instead of cutting some things out and making it more consistent.  As always though, if you want to read more into it I think you can. I'm not full on death of the author, but what you get out of a movie is just as valid as what the director intended to put in it. I personally didn't get a whole lot out of A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night. I certainly see where the feminist interpretation of it comes from and I'd be interested in a more in-depth reading of it that way, but I didn't think that was a huge part of the film or anything that would come close to a ""message"". Not that films need to have a message in the first place, but you get what I mean. You can certainly read it as feminist, but I don't think Amirpour was overtly trying to make a feminist movie."
TrueFilm,3cb26q,BorisJonson1593,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"My viewing experience with this film was similar to how I interpret David Lynch movies where I go ""Okay if I connect all these parts it makes sense. As for the rest of it... I'm not sure, I'll just leave that dangling by the wayside and just view it as some kind of coloring, like a word that I know means something but don't understand.""  I'll say up front I liked it a lot, though. I really liked the scene where main character man goes back to the vampire's apartment while he's on ecstasy and they just spend a long time physically getting closer to eachother. This would've been really dull and looked like a cheap slow motion sequence if it weren't for the fact that he spun that disco ball. So in the background we see the fast disco ball lights spinning against the walls and it let's us know and experience this event happening in real time.  As for meaning, I saw it as a feminist movie, one that's benefited by being more than a Tarantino-style revenge fantasy. When she kills the heroin-user, the father of the man she possibly loves maybe, this becomes a moral impasse in the film. It's the first kill that the film implies was not completely justified. It seemed to say something along the lines of, ""Look, I'm not actually saying you should kill misogynists and I'm not actually saying this would be a cool thing IRL. I know you think that's what the film was going for, but it's not. The MDMA guy's cool, and that little kid might be as well. There's hope for the next generation, but this was just my method of venting my frustration with the current climate of misogyny.""  But the pit of dead bodies? I got no idea. That person dancing with a balloon? Maybe it represents a longing for... freedom of expression or something and being open with one's identity without fear of subjugation at the hands of conservative weirdos? I'm stretching it.  The film maybe didn't make complete and total sense, but I thought the scene with the pimp lifting weights in his room was hilarious."
TrueFilm,3cb26q,Fatmanredemption,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:59:57 2015 UTC,"I adore the film for its precise style, photography, soundtrack, and use of atmosphere+tone (especially considering it's from a first time director), but I'd have to agree that it's a little bit too ambiguous at times. It was sold to me as a feminist film of sorts, but the only feminist attitudes it seems to have are ""sexism is bad"". It doesn't examine the origins of sexism or anything like that. That doesn't make it any less of a good movie at all, though. I blame the reviewers and the marketing tactics, personally. Mark Kermode's 5/5 star review is the best of them all, because he talks about the movie itself as an incredibly entertaining and well executed movie, and nothing more. I'd have to agree with that.   Despite not being what many people are saying it is, it's still somewhere in my top ten of 2014 for sure. Amirpour obviously has a great directorial vision, and I'm expecting her upcoming film with Keanu Reeves and Jim Carrey to be even better."
TrueFilm,3ccphm,noclaf1,9,Mon Jul 6 21:58:40 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I loved this movie and I take some offense (jokingly) at your jab against Chung-Hoon Chung's ridiculous cinematography. There were certain shots (the intro to the cafeteria, young Earl running from the dog) that made me ask ""HOW DID THEY DO THAT?!"". I also saw those more as Greg telling us his story as a first-person omniscient character, so we float through the exposition quickly and efficiently as this is his life and he knows what he's trying to say.  As for the climax in the hospital, I would disagree again. I think there, the burden is on the editing and Brian Eno's score and it nails it. I think here, you missed the forest for the trees and are just harping on the shot composition which is static and hand-held (and not that exciting mind you), but there was never a time here where I thought ""oh, well. this was unneccessary"". I look forward to whatever Gomez-Rejon does next and I'm sure he has a lot of options now."
TrueFilm,3ccphm,ghiju123,4,Mon Jul 6 23:56:36 2015 UTC,"I've seen this film twice since its release, and have to say I disagree with you on most accounts. I actually went into the first showing expecting to hate it, I thought it looked like an unoriginal, high school indie flick. While some of the cliche's were certainly there, like Greg's description of high school clique's, but for the most part I found it to be full of heart, emotion, and bold originality. It had plenty of issues: It was clearly full of itself for avoiding cliches while falling into others, a cringeworthy depiction of drug use, and as you said some joke's fell flat. I wasn't a huge fan of the titles, but some of them (The part where Earl holds nothing sacred) made me laugh out loud.  I found Greg's humor to be annoying, but I accepted that as part of the character, and I was able to believe that other characters found him funny, so that never really bothered  me much. I actually really liked the flashy cinematography; I'm totally fine with cool shots being used because they look cool and for no other reason. Of course the greatest cinematography will have meaning behind it, but the flashiness of the cinematography in this film gave it a nice, fast paced style and helped elevate the storytelling. It was a good story that took advantage of the medium film, by making every scene interesting. I also think that a lot of shots did have meaning, and the movie had very intelligent blocking and camerawork. There is a scene when Greg and Earl are discussing how to do the film where Earl walks outside to smoke, continuing talking to Greg through the window when he says he never agreed to anything, literally putting a wall up to Greg and Earl. This film ends up becoming a large point of the falling out of Greg and Earl. There is a similar scene with Greg and his father later in the film. The scene in which Greg and the girl fight is done very well too, with one long, unmoving shot that lets us focus at our will on either the reaction of Greg or the girl. The hospital scene i found to be absolutely beautiful (the projector shot is one of my favorite cinematographical tropes) and the color combined with the score (probably mostly the score) elicited a huge emotional response for me, and I was in tears from that scene until the credits rolled.   I also disagree with you on the characters; I found them to be very strong and well written. Greg is the most fleshed out character, because we see the story from his point of view. Like many high schoolers (my former self included), he unknowingly lives the paradox of being both self hating and narcissistic. His insecurities were very relatable to me, and Earl's explanation of his insecurities was very spot on. For me, he was empathetic, yet selfish. In a way, watching the character of Greg revealed a lot about myself, which is probably one of the best things a character in fiction can do. Greg is constantly selfish, truly revealing this in his big fight with the dying girl. I loved the final scene where he sees her art, realizing that he never really got to know her as much as he should have. Also his passion for cinema and artistic talent put an original twist on the character. The love interest was handled really well too in my opinion, as it's clearly never set up as ""love"" as it is hormonal attraction. It's not set up as a main goal for the character, and even the accomplishment of scoring the hot prom date is set aside for the purely plutonic relationship of Greg and the girl."
TrueFilm,3c8jqr,duckduckmooo,7,Sun Jul 5 22:18:25 2015 UTC,"Everyone in this thread seems to be focused on directors declines but i wanna talk about a director's, not so much decline, but the steady evolution of Paul Thomas Anderson.    I’m 30 and I tend to think about how much I’ve changed and grown through the different time periods of my life, and I imagine the changes that are going to come.    This is the exact thing i like to think about when I think about PTA's filmography. It's really fascinating looking at something like Boogie Nights, something he made when he was so young. If you pay attention to his directing and writing, it's fantastic, but it's so much different than the style of filmmaking of The Master and TWBB.   i think PTA is a good example of someone whose career has been a steady incline, both in popularity and in the quality of his films.   Also, if you listen to the WTF podcast with PTA, he talks about how Magnolia was a film he made to help cope and express how he felt about his dad dying, so there's an example i can specifically think of, where a filmmaker develops his art based on his experiences as an adult, and i think it's interesting to pay attention to just how different his later films now that he's older, constantly transitioning and developing into his own unique voice."
TrueFilm,3c8jqr,superbobby324,7,Mon Jul 6 07:18:30 2015 UTC,"I think the same thing can be applied to Wes Anderson too. His style may not have differ over the years but if you compare Bottle Rocket to The Grand Budapest Hotel, you can see how Wes Anderson has evolved in terms of scale."
TrueFilm,3c8jqr,JASON9818,6,Mon Jul 6 08:28:54 2015 UTC,"The evolution of Wes Anderson is very interesting to me. His first three films, Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, and The Royal Tenenbaums, all seemed to build up his strength, assurance, and style as a director, with Royal Tens being a crowning achievement and his first big financial and critical success. Then, with a $50 million dollar budget, he made The Life Aquatic, a flop both commercially and critically. I like the film, and I think it is probably the most ambitious of his career, which is also part of its downfall. It's a little too much for it's own good, and what keeps the film afloat (pun intended) is the basic emotional arc of Zissou and his son. Coming off from that film, Wes did The Darjeeling Limited, which is both a film about soul-searching and a film for Anderson that was very much about trying to reground himself in a way. It has some of the most heart of his films, and some of the least cinematic spectacle (not that it's not beautiful and shows off a lovely India backdrop).  What came next was a major turn in career. Fantastic Mr. Fox and Moonrise Kingdom. These are the two films where the ""Wes Anderson"" style, so prominent that it's easily-parodied, really came about. While these stories still have the resonant emotional core that all his films have, their really shinning point is in Anderson's style, two films that use cinematic art form in such a delightful way that so many fail to try to do. Exactly what he tried to do in Life Aquatic but failed to commit to.   After the success of these two came his most recent film, his biggest success to date, The Grand Budapest Hotel. Grand Budapest has everything that makes a Wes Anderson film great: heart, thematic bite, and his verbose take on cinematic style. It's not my favorite of his, but I think it's going to be the film that really defines him as a filmmaker in years to come. Not his masterpiece but his golden standard.   But I'll happy to be proven wrong."
TrueFilm,3c8jqr,hugogernsback,42,Mon Jul 6 15:48:50 2015 UTC,"Usually when a director is pronounced a genius that early on it's by people who don't know what they're talking about or are too eager to discover the next big talent. I remember Shyamalan was  also supposed to be the next Hitchcock. Christopher Nolan was supposed to the next Hitchcock too, until he made Interstellar and he was the next Kubrick. At best, he's the new David Lean. (And still doesn't have an Oscar for it.)   Shyamalan didn't go into decline. He just didn't know how to give the audience something they want. He's now reverted back to a stylist-for-hire. But even in The Sixth Sense, everything people complain about him was already there. It's also a pretty good movie. It's not till The Happening that he made a movie nobody will defend, and that's when he was creatively dead. Sometimes that happens. The same thing happened to Cameron Crowe and Tim Burton. The master example is Michael Cimino, who somehow managed to win Best Picture with a movie few people care about today. His next movie, Heaven's Gate, may very well be his best movie. It was also a catastrophe for the industry, critics, and audiences. Everything he made after that is worthless.  There are lots of talented directors out there and they may manage at least one good movie, but sometimes their careers go wrong and they don't have the freedom or money they need to thrive. Roman Polanski had just become a great director when his career was obliterated. He's made good movies since, but imagine what he could have done with the Hollywood machine still backing him up.    Or sometimes directors are like Tarantino, who seems stuck, and loudly proclaiming that he'd sooner quit filmmaking than grow up.  Sometimes the sort of movie a director likes to make goes out of fashion. Paul Verhoeven is a more talented director of blockbusters than anyone who has made a superhero movie in the last 15 years. Yet he's not making them anymore, and even if it he did, it wouldn't fit in. Or they can be like James Cameron and George Miller, who still make movies, but won't work unless they have years to commit to developing a good movie instead of dashing out just-ok ones. And then there's Kathryn Bigelow, who was also great at genre movies, but reinvented her career instead of still trying to get them made.  It seems like the hardest thing in the world for someone to develop into a true artist while also inspiring the confidence of crews and producers to stand behind them. One way of thinking about it is to only treat as 'great directors' the ones who manage to do that and not to overpraise whoever just made the last sensational movie. When  successful directors get old they tend to become more personal and less showy and audiences and critics sometimes interpret that as a decline. But the difference between Terrence Malick or Hayao Miyazaki and M. Night Shyamalan is hopefully obvious."
TrueFilm,3c8jqr,lordhadri,9,Sun Jul 5 23:59:56 2015 UTC,"At best, he's the new David Lean.   I'd take that as an enormous praise as well, but I really don't think Nolan is all that Lean-like either. What he seems to do, in my view, is take what works from a bunch of the old masters and integrate it into his own bleak style. He's really a mix-up of a lot of different directors, Hitchcock, Kubrick, and Lean included, and almost conservatively remains within the limits of their already proven direction and narrative, yet being a skillful director himself he's able to gather these past experiences into something unique to him."
TrueFilm,3c8jqr,Bahamabanana,15,Mon Jul 6 07:56:32 2015 UTC,"The Deer Hunter is a movie that, whenever I attempt to create a top 10, always cracks the list.  Do people really care about it any less than similar 70s American prestige films? Like, say, The Conversation?  That's a movie that I always see put up as one of the greatest of the 70s, and yet I tend to come across more fans of The Deer Hunter.  It's an emotional work with fans who connect to it rather than just admire it.  Everything after Heaven's Gate is worthless?? I like plenty of the post-HG Cimino films, but Year of the Dragon in particular doesn't deserve a ""worthless"" tag."

But Shyamalan wants to make a low-grade sci-fi horror movie with more artistic integrity than anyone else and therefore The Happening gives the audience neither, so there was no audience for it. It didn't help that he made a movie that promised something would happen and everyone expected that would be something ridiculous like blaming plants for it, so of course everyone made fun of it. Kinda odd that nobody in charge of the movie saw that coming and put a stop to it."
TrueFilm,3c8jqr,lordhadri,10,Mon Jul 6 10:19:39 2015 UTC,"I guess this might be the best thread to discuss my opinion on Orson Welles.  Most people would call Orson Welles the Citizen Kane man. He was given all of the freedom in the world and for that he created one of the biggest game changers in all of cinema yet this movie perhaps accosted him all of his creative freedom.  Citizen Kane is his last big budget movie and every movie became a studio mess.  The Magnicifence Ambersons has a tacked on happy ending with multiple sequences cut.  The Girl from Shanghai was heavily edited with the climax being mostly cut.  Touch of Evil was edited heavily. Things got so bad that he ended up burning all his bridges and retreating outside of Hollywood to receive some proper financing.  As the years gone by, his movies essentially became small budget until the last movie he ever made was basically a low budget documentary.  This is however not a bad thing as I realized. To call Orson Welles the Citizen Kane guy is a major insult. His contribution to film noirs greatly outweighs most of his peers. The Trial and his Chimes at Midnight are contenders for his best movie--yes, even better than Citizen Kane. His F for Fake pioneered the ever popular Video Essay.  It's still a wonder what else would Orson Welles do with a high budget. Would it really improve his works or would his bloated ego assure a flop. Some call his life a fall from grace; I call it a change in direction."

TrueFilm,3c8jqr,tinyweinr,12,Mon Jul 6 18:41:58 2015 UTC,"Would Goerge Lucas count?  You have a man who worked against the Hollywood system. He started out with films like American Graffiti and THX-1138. A man who created the most familiar and well-known movie trilogy of all time, Star Wars, and then went on to make Indiana Jones, yet another successful trilogy. He fought against the recolonization of black and white films in 1988. He fought against the machine and inspired so many filmmakers and storytellers.  Sadly, in coming years he became the machine. Indie filmmaker Lucas was replaced with billionaire entrepreneur Lucas. Who went on to make Star Wars 1,2 and 3, Red Tails, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and whatever the hell this is."

TrueFilm,3c8jqr,lordhadri,4,Mon Jul 6 01:51:38 2015 UTC,"In my opinion ""any better than he was in the first place"" would then be anything after Star Wars, since he didn't direct Empire Strikes Back (Irvin Kershner did) or Return of the Jedi (Richard Marquand did). He directed very few films at all. He wrote and produced quite a few, and he did that with teams of other people. So I'd have to politely disagree that he is the most influential living director.  Also, since OP mentioned  American directors and then  you, Tim Burton, and I'm not sure if regression is the right word exactly, but I feel some point has passed and I wonder if he (Tim Burton) will ever make a truly good film again."

And yet as different as those movies are they are so Tarantino. I love seeing what someone who makes great movies for a couple million bucks can do with an actual budget.   Of course there are people like Lucas where that freedom turns out to be an absolute curse. Some filmmakers have the restraint and some don't...though I suppose ""restraint"" seems like an odd word to use about Django, but if you look at the violence against ""bad guys"" compared to the violence against slaves, you see that it's there. Tarantino still knows when it's better to use cutaways and editing tricks like a filmmaker with no budget would be forced to use.

If directors make a few great movies early on and then make bad movies, people talk can't stop talking about their decline. Most directors, however, have ups and downs, or are fairly consistent throughout their career. Shyamalan is often mentioned in this sort of discussion, but mostly because The Sixth Sense developed so much buzz, and he developed the script for The Sixth Sense laboriously over years with a fair amount of help from other creatives in the industry. People forget, however, that most critics ignored Fincher or dismissed him an empty stylist until Zodiac. Demme made a lot of ignored movies with Corman before Melvin and Howard and Something Wild. And, while people talk about Hitchcock's failures towards the end, they often ignore the fact that he also dramatically improved over the course of his first twenty years making movies in Britain (and not just because he started to get more control of his movies)."

I don't consider Fight Club to be the reigning masterpiece it is often regarded as,and that his greatest achievement is Zodiac, which was middle(ish) of his career. I can maybe see why you would think his most recent output is not that great as I'm really not crazy for House of Cards and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but that has more to do with the scripts he is working with than any decline in his ability. Gone Girl was wicked though. One of the best mystery who-done-it in recent memory."
TrueFilm,3c4gma,Fatmanredemption,51,Sat Jul 4 18:11:09 2015 UTC,"Excellent analysis, I entirely agree with you, and I figured I'd transcribe a quote from Miyazaki relevant to this, from Turning Point: 1997-2008:   In other works of yours [besides Spirited Away], such as My Neighbor Totoro and Princess Mononoke, you also depict spirits that inhabit Japan's nature.  Why is this?  As the late Ryotaro Shiba said, despite the fact that Buddhism and Confucianism were imported into Japan, we Japanese still have our own primitive religious beliefs.  For example, I really like the story of Sasajizo; the grandfather and the grandmother who appear in the story really have few wants.  When the grandfather can't sell any more straw hats, he can't buy any rice cakes, but he feels so sorry for the jizo that he brushes the snow off of him, gives him a straw hat, and then goes home.  Then the grandmother says, ""You did a good thing.""  Well, I often think how wonderful it would be to live like that, to be satisfied by something like that.  I dream of a life with someone like that old woman.  To be so pure is the supreme goal.  Even now, I think that deep in the hearts of us inhabitants of these islands these ideas remain -- to be purified, to purge, to get rid of defilement, to be refreshed, to be rid of unwanted thoughts.  Even now, I think that deep in our hearts, we still pursue the dream of this kind of purity.  This is why, when we Japanese talk about preserving nature with German people, the conversations don't mesh.  Germans want to control nature, but we don't want to control it, and we want to create a place where it isn't controlled.  We want a place that won't be defiled by human desire or greed.  It's all right if something comes into this ecosystem and it changes as a result.  But we don't want the ecosystem to be defiled by human hands.  This way of thinking may also be a major reason why Japanese have so much trouble communicating internationally, but it is also one of the more important elements that make us Japanese.  Of course, there's always the danger that this same aspect will get out of control and lead to a lack of realism and to too much self-sacrifice for the sake of the group, but when Earth has fallen on hard times, I think our ideals can also be an important support for us.  I think it's important to remember that we can't control the world, that we need a sense of respect for it, even some humility.    Of course in an interview around the same time, he can come off as a bit of a luddite:   Our current civilization is at a dead end.  What we really need is young people who can see far into the future, telling people that they don't really need to go buy Louis Vuitton products and so forth, that it's okay to go back to the days of shopping with an old-style shopping basket in hand.  Who needs video games?  And we don't need to be using all this electricity.  It's even okay to take a bath only once every two days.   Miyazaki is often obsessed in his works with capturing the spirit of his childhood wonder.  That's not to say he doesn't attack heavy subjects, but it's always through this lens of inquisitiveness and a longing to feel as carefree and whimsical as childhood felt."
TrueFilm,3c4gma,tomrhod,24,Sat Jul 4 19:56:49 2015 UTC,"always through this lens of inquisitiveness and a longing to feel as carefree and whimsical as childhood felt.   I believe it's for precisely this reason that most people miss the subtext of his films, since the surface level stories are always engaging enough on their own. The same people who reacted negatively towards The Wind Rises likely viewed Spirited Away as solely an adventurous coming of age story. Which it is, but there's more to it than that.   Some might say this subtlety worked to his detriment in a more serious story like The Wind Rises, but honestly I believe this subtlety is what makes his movies so good. He's completely interested in making good artwork and stories first, while at the same time weaving in this hidden layer not many pick up on, possibly because he thinks he won't get away with it otherwise, or that the more obvious route is artistically offensive and you wind up making something on the level of Wall Street where the main character's dad tells you the moral of the story during the last five minutes."
TrueFilm,3c4gma,tomrhod,42,Sat Jul 4 20:30:56 2015 UTC,"It is interesting that his contemporary -- Isao Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies, Princess Kaguya) -- seems to turn the issue around.  He infuses childhood with the reality of a situation, grim and heartbreaking though it often is.  Even as the children in his stories must be children, they're often forced to be adults too.  In Takahata's work, the world is as painful as reality, even as the characters try to maintain their hope and joyfulness, while in Miyazaki's films, the world is always magical even as terrible things happen.  It's a stark and important difference in how they've approached essentially the same ideas.  Consequently, they both come off very differently in interviews as I've read them.  Miyazaki, as you read, seems to maintain hope but yet has a lot of curmudgeonly grumbling that he does about the way things are and should be.  Meanwhile, Takahata is much more optimistic and jovial in how he approaches the world.  It's almost like their personalities are reversed in their work, scratching an itch they don't in their waking life, so to speak.  Miyazaki explores his hopes, Takahata examines his fears.  It's an interesting phenomenon that I've observed in other filmmakers, but these two provide excellent contrast as a case study."

I've got nothing to say except that's a really great observation."
TrueFilm,3c4gma,crichmond77,3,Sat Jul 4 20:54:22 2015 UTC,"I picked up on most of these themes in Miyazaki's films, and I liked all the ones I've seen except for The Wind Rises (Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle, My Neighbor Totoro.)  Maybe you could expound on why you enjoy The Wind Rises and what I may have missed. I thought it was pretty empty. I understand the main character's desire to find greatness for himself and his country, his admirable selflessness, and the themes of Japan's lagging behind the other nations in terms of modernization, but I felt like all that was pretty on-the-nose."

TrueFilm,3c4gma,Dark1000,3,Sun Jul 5 17:39:46 2015 UTC,"The only thing I find confusing about Hulk's essay is when he refers to the film as a ""traditional western epic."" Does he mean western as in the genre, or western as in the hemisphere? Because if it's the former, I really don't think The Wind Rises counts and I'm not saying that just because of the setting.  That being said, I really like this:    PERHAPS THE PROBLEM OF JIRO'S OPPENHEIMER MOMENT IS HE DOES NOT HAVE A OPPENHEIMER-LIKE QUOTE OF BECOMING THE DESTROYER OF WORLDS OR SOMETHING.   Exactly. He just has that horrified disenchanted stare after seeing his dream become a reality (right before the very last scene with the graveyard of Zeros.) Miyazaki used that same subtlety for Kamaji in Spirited Away. At no point does he say, ""I myself loved someone long ago, but I had to give up on my dreams and fend for myself, hence why I'm trapped here in the boiler room. But you, Chihiro, have that same spark of love I had forty years ago! I believe in your spirit of selflessness and how money means nothing to you, so I give you this ticket!""  We don't hear Chihiro say to Haku, ""You've been helping me all along this whole time, and I remembered your name because I recognize that natural feeling of childhood that you evoke in me, being that you saved me when I was a child! Because, you, Haku, are a river god and have thusly reminded me that I, like every human alive, am truly a spirit of this earth who had sadly forgotten its original joyous nature after being duped into a life of pain and servitude by our capitalist system! Was blind, but now I see!""  Only thing is, you can be subtle with the Spirited Away messages and no one's upset. Use that same approach with The Wind Rises and now people are calling you a war crime apologist."

Use that same approach with The Wind Rises and now people are calling you a war crime apologist.   Indeed, and people also forget that the film takes place entirely from Jiro's perspective, and he's mostly shielded from the horrors of his creation. Granted, he also maintains a bit of willful ignorance too, trying to sustain the wonder of aircraft design while secretly understanding the purpose behind it.  But that kind of viewpoint requires, as you say, subtlety to work properly, otherwise it becomes too heavy-handed, especially for Miyazaki."
TrueFilm,3c4gma,imephraim,2,Mon Jul 6 00:27:32 2015 UTC,"That was a great analysis btw. It really crystallized The Wind Rises for me.  It's the only time I'll probably say this of anything, but there were not enough swastikas. Just one would have been enough. I think it would have cemented the theme for ourselves, but also for Jiro. It's one of those symbols that you cannot claim ignorance of, even for someone with Jiro's tunnel vision."
TrueFilm,3c4gma,otherpeoplesmusic,2,Mon Jul 6 09:03:31 2015 UTC,"If I was a producer or financier on that film, the one note I'd give Miyazaki would be: There are German soldiers in the film and at least one point the word ""Nazi"" is used, but no swastikas. Just give the people what they want and throw in a swastika."
TrueFilm,3c4gma,lustprinzip,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:24:36 2015 UTC,"I think his subtlety is what made The Wind Rises such a good film.

One of my favorite things about the film is the usage of water, and it links to your analysis in an interesting way. Yubaba's industrialized bath house has harnessed water in such a way that it is a product that can be sold. What was formerly a natural substance has been shifted into an owned resource, and corrupted into something valuable only for its worth in money and intrinsically erotic.   Areas where water has been left untouched are the sanctuaries in this world, and when powered by the sort of greed-trumping love power that you've described, this water can cleanse places that have been ruined by industrialization (and by capitalism, as your theory suggests)."
TrueFilm,3c4gma,mynameismarkcarlos,8,Sun Jul 5 06:22:03 2015 UTC,"Really well written analysis. Thanks for taking the time to write this out, really adds to my enjoyment of the film. It's one of those cases where I felt what you were saying, but never took the time to analyze my feelings and give words to them, so that's why I'm thanking you - you've solidified feelings into coherent thoughts.   I need more coffee."
TrueFilm,3c4gma,augiemarched,8,Sun Jul 5 06:42:22 2015 UTC,"So I wouldn't say the film is exactly anti-capitalist in the political sense of the word, but it's against money over nature (which capitalism rewards,) money over humanity (which capitalism rewards,) and a life dictated by greed (which capitalism rewards.)    If you are against capitalism's pillars you're against capitalism. You say ""rewards"" to avoid tackling the argument too hard, but in fact is a depiction of how stupid, dangerous, disgusting and immoral capitalism is. It's the only tale we have on cellulose criticising pillars of everyday ""perfectly normal"" capitalistic life, like working, in such a precise, surgical manner.  Great work by the way."
TrueFilm,3c4gma,RoundSparrow,8,Sun Jul 5 09:27:45 2015 UTC,"You got me there. I do shy away from being completely firm about the contentious nature of the film's argument with that last paragraph. I suppose I felt that if I were to completely and adamantly refer this as an anti-capitalist film, it would almost cheapen the movie in a way, because then it might feel less like a wonderful, engaging, pinnacle of modern art, beautifully scored, heartfelt and earnest coming-of-age movie that's simlultaneously heavily critical of capitalism, and more like a Trojan horse movie tricking people world-wide under the guise of children's entertainment with its anti-capitalist message.  What I mean is that if I'm being honest this film is pretty much anti-capitalist in most regards, but I also want to stress this isn't Animal Farm where the basic thrust of the film is only socio-political-economic. I feel like stressing that could cause people to get caught up in the film's ""hidden"" meaning and wind up with a colder viewing experience where they miss out on the warmth and fascination.  You are completely dead on, though."

TrueFilm,3c4gma,PrecisionEsports,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:14:22 2015 UTC,"Spirited Away is still in the top 4. But since I was 12 to maybe 20 I heralded the film as my favorite movie of all time, and this latest viewing didn't get as strong of an emotional reaction out of me, so I guess I just decided I had maybe drained a lot of the magic from it after having seen it so many times. It doesn't lessen the movie as a whole for me. I wouldn't take points off of a score for it, but it's just no longer the one that evokes the strongest feelings in me. Still a 10/10, hands down.  As to what's my favorite currently, I'm not entirely sure. I have to finish my rewatch of all his films before I can declare my personal favorite with any confidence, but it just might be My Neighbor Totoro. Kind of an odd choice to steal the top spot from Spirited Away, being that they are very different movies. The next two on my rewatch list are Mononoke and Porco Rosso. I had only seen Porco Rosso once about three or four years ago, but maybe it'll be my new favorite.   In fact I'm not even sure what the true qualifiers are for ""my favorite"" aside from the emotional aspect. Maybe I just said Totoro because it's my ""liek dis if u cry evrytim"" movie."
TrueFilm,3c6c1g,svene,25,Sun Jul 5 06:33:55 2015 UTC,"I am not a huge fan of the horror genre either but I continue to watch horror movies because I am fascinated by them. I feel like horror movies reveal things about our collective unconscious that other movies don't. For example, a few years ago I watched every Friday the 13th movie. This is not a thing I recommend unless you are really into either horror movies or punishment. They aren't good movies. But they say something about the atmosphere of the time they were produced that I wouldn't have picked up from, say, Back to the Future or any relatively acclaimed film of the mid-eighties.  The Friday the 13th films are all about punishment of the wicked. All of the victims in those 80s slasher movies are all promiscuous teens who drink, and we are meant to identify with both the victims and the killer. I feel that way, anyway. We are meant to be titilated by the sex and illicit behavior of the teens in question and the slasher who kills them for it. It's a really 80s, Reagan way of looking at sex and violence, which you might not get from any other film of the 80s. Are they good films on their own? Hell naw. But they are totally fascinating for their views on sex and violence.  I personally hold the view that any film can educate you on something, even if it is just how not to make a movie. If horror excites you in some way, I encourage you to seek out other films in the genre. If not, that's totally understandable, but you might be missing out on some cultural understanding. Or, you might be able to get that from some non-horror film. I don't really know; honestly, I'm a little bit drunk right now.  I will say that The Thing by John Carpenter is one of the few absolutely perfect and essential horror films that I have seen. Kubrick's The Shining is fantastic as well, but -- and this might get me some flak -- I would argue that if you were only going to see one other horror film ever, it should be The Thing."
TrueFilm,3c6c1g,redhopper,11,Sun Jul 5 07:18:01 2015 UTC,"The Thing does so many things right - even just how the characters simply are and behave as you would in that situation. No exposition or background, but you know the deal with each of them. Everyone's an equal so anything could happen.  The only thing (ahem) I'd change is that at the very start, the opening credit sequence, it would be better to avert your eyes and ears until ""The Thing"" appears on screen. It's a better film if you don't know that bit of context."
TrueFilm,3c6c1g,TriumphantGeorge,3,Sun Jul 5 07:48:41 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that the original Friday the 13th is a remarkably sex-positive film. The sex scene in the middle of the film is at the woman's request, and it is the woman who controls the encounter start-to-end. It's pretty interesting how far we backslide from that to ""all sex is punished"" in a few short film's time."
TrueFilm,3c6c1g,npcdel,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:32:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I have seen the first 13th film, I thought it was pretty good and a bit less sexual than the rest."

TrueFilm,3c6c1g,ChrisMorrison93,10,Wed Jul 8 17:21:39 2015 UTC,"This is such a broad topic, it's almost hard to know where to begin.  I suppose I'm curious what horror films you've seen?  Have you seen The Shining, Alien, and The Thing?  I could write a great deal on all of them as great pieces of cinema, let alone great horror.  As for what horror offers that other genres don't...  Fear is a fleeting emotion.  It's one of the few emotions during movies that dies a quick death after its seen.  The moment the first screening of a horror film ends, its secrets have been revealed -- all the monsters in the closet are lit up for you to see.  A horror film might unnerve you yet, but it can never make you really afraid a second time.  So what's left is the quality of the storytelling, the cinematography, the writing, acting, etc.  This makes horror a unique genre in that the element of surprise (of mystery) is so integral to its success, that it's too often the primary focus without giving enough credence to the rest of the pieces.  That's why so many horror films are subpar at the end of the day -- making someone JUMP is easy, building dread is hard, and have it stay a great film after you've stopped being afraid shows real craftsmanship.  It's really hard to do a brilliant horror film because it's not only hard to do a great film, but to do that while anticipating the main emotion driving the first viewing -- anxiety and stress -- is going to dissipate after.  In this way, to make a truly extraordinary horror film, you need to make two films on top of each other -- the film you see on first viewing, and the film you see every other time after.  It's a careful balance that's hard to fulfill, and that's one way the genre remains special and worth a further look."
TrueFilm,3c6c1g,Nitroburninfunnybong,15,Sun Jul 5 07:10:28 2015 UTC,"I have to work in a few hours but I love every time horror is brought up on truefilm. It's been mentioned already that it's a very broad genre, but it's also one that consistently falls victim to ""is it dead"" and/or ""is _______ reviving horror?"" It's like when 55 year olds say punk is dead but it's not - they are just not around the 20 year olds throwing basement shows and keeping the traditions alive. Sometimes you have to do some digging and most of the quality genre films each year don't get wide theatrical treatment.   Anyway, here is a list off the top of my head that stand out in the genre in recent years and I believe hold some of the qualities you're looking for that are really only offered in horror films. Though some are incredibly violent, they do not focus on sexualized violence. (Note:  I say only sexualized violence because I find there to be a difference in women being objectified while slaughtered on screen as compared to having violence inflicted on them in an equal way compared to their male counterparts. I hope that makes sense. I am very tired.)   Kill List  Berberian Sound Studio  We Are What We Are  Resolution  Spring  American Mary (yes, the catalyst of the plot is a sexual assault but it digs deep into a counter culture in a way other genres could not)  Excision  Snowtown/Snowtown Murders  John Carpenter's work - particularly The Thing as mentioned here as well as In the Mouth of Madness and Prince of Darkness. Also early Cronenbergh such as Videodrome - this fucking film basically predicted how we consume reality tv, beheading videos, etc. from the comfort of our homes with complete disregard to the humans involved being hurt.  Hellraiser and Hellbound:  Hellraiser II.  Read up on Victor Salva and then watch Jeepers Creepers. It is horrific. You're basically watching this filmmaker portray the monster that lives inside of him on screen. It's unsettling.  Lastly, even though a major theme is violence against women I have to suggest Martyrs, it is one of my favorite movies. Not too long ago on truefilm this film was being debated and a user broke down the film beautifully explaining the writer/directors intentions when it comes to his commentary on the role of women in the age of ""torture porn"" horror. Unfortunately he deleted it a few hours later. What a dick.  Anyway, hopefully some of these interest you and you enjoy them and get something out of horror you didn't expect to.  Edit:  Definitely check out the classics as well I just didn't mention them because others already did. The Shining, Alien, etc.   Also, it's pretty unanimously hated but I think it is under appreciated and a few decades from now will hopefully be a cult favorite - watch Rob Zombie's directors cut of Halloween 2. I find it to be a horror masterpiece and could rant about it for hours, but one of the biggest things that separates it from any other horror film is it deals directly with the characters from the first movie and the PTSD they've developed due to those events. Usually the characters in sequels have a few flashbacks during a thunderstorm, but the two leads are both psychologically traumatized and deal with it in opposing ways - how young women would be dealing with the horror they encountered.   All right I'll shut up."
TrueFilm,3c6c1g,pmcinern,3,Sun Jul 5 08:26:49 2015 UTC,I agree with all these films. Id add The Babadook and It Follows to this list.

TrueFilm,3c6c1g,imephraim,5,Mon Jul 6 14:54:05 2015 UTC,"It's strange how little Argento is discussed, even when talking about horror. His works are about as expressive as you can get, and still are genuinely scary. The man really has a grasp on how to use every tool in the kit to scare the audoence. And when he is talked about, it's as if Argento as a great director is a given. Like his name makes an appearance every so often, is acknowledged, and is subsequently tucked away until next year. Am I alone in thinking this? I'm glad you mentioned Argento, and wish he would get as much lipservice as John Carpenter does. A lot of those giallo horrors taught the 80's how to scare."

Italy was huge in the horror game of yesteryear, with Argento, Bava, and Fulci being top-tier and Lenzi, Deodato, and Mattei wetting the appetite of many a gorehound (such as myself).  Recently, Japan and France have been somewhat impressive. Unfortunately, I don't have the proper materials to cite examples."
TrueFilm,3c5dcj,movmovlover,31,Sat Jul 4 23:20:32 2015 UTC,"I think critics and film buffs would still love it, and it would still make a ton of money. Dinosaurs will always be fucking awesome, which is why people would see it regardless, but I can definitely imagine many walking out disappointed since it doesn't have the amount of action we're accustomed to seeing by now in summer movies. But even after all these years, the build up, camera work, editing, score, and suspense still hold up as masterful filmmaking. I'm in the camp that believes Jurassic Park is first and foremost a horror film. The aspects of JP that I just mentioned are all essential in succeeding in that genre, which is why I think Jurassic Park has been able to overcome the dated CGI, and will continue to age well."

TrueFilm,3c5dcj,Xaguta,24,Sun Jul 5 17:53:29 2015 UTC,"While I don't completely remember the movie (have not seen it in years so I might be inaccurate forward on), Jurassic Park had a clear conflict with legitimate character decisions that alter the path of the narrative. That trait already places Jurassic Park above other blockbusters because its plot is used economically; every shot had a purpose that progress the story. It is absent of self-indulgent death scenes (the secretary's death in ""Jurassic World"" is a good example of one) and pointless sections. Jurassic park is a cohesive story that is told with an honesty that will make it a highlight of the decade if it came out today.  Jurassic Park’s biggest advantage, besides coherence, the majority of contemporary Hollywood blockbusters are too afraid to be sincere. Scenes such as the reveal of the Brachiosaurus don't exist in too many modern major budget films because it is easy to become overtly cheesy when tackling segments earnestly. If handled wrong, the scene feels fake, fraudulent. Hell, countering this with cynical irony does not help either. Jurassic World, with shoving products and familiar store signs during the reveal of the new amusement park, coat with sweeping music of the first film, making fun the audience for expecting something magical. That felt cold, inhumanely cold. Even scenes that should have been magical, the little boy finally at close range with the dinosaurs, are dimmed by sardonic quips, quips of the nature that now brimful in most modern blockbusters. Jurassic Park's approach to its story with candor will no doubt be a major factor in its popularity because of how few modern-big-budget films interpret their tale in a tight, candid approach. Jurassic Park will be a breath of fresh air if premiered today."
TrueFilm,3c5dcj,MUSTKILLNOOBS,4,Sun Jul 5 03:13:34 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to say that I thought the almost pointless death of the secretary was probably the ""best"" death of the film in terms of how it made me feel, but it was very odd compared to the general carefree action movie blockbuster attitude it displayed.   The completely gruesome death she got wasn't what her character deserved, which left me feeling violated in a sense. I think that that scene probably is going to be the most memorable part of the film to me. I honestly wouldn't have minded a very dark and gritty film that was much more intense than what we got. I know it wouldn't have been anywhere close to the theme of the original, but I think it would've stood on it's own much better."
TrueFilm,3c5dcj,anyhistoricalfigure,2,Mon Jul 6 07:01:38 2015 UTC,"I felt as if the secretary's death was done so over the top on purpose as a way to show how indiscriminate the dinosaurs are in their rampage.   Sort of a counter to the normal action movie death proportionate to what they deserve, I guess.  It reminded me of the way Lost would kill off a character to remind you that anyone could die at anytime."
TrueFilm,3c5dcj,goldenrobotdick,5,Mon Jul 6 20:42:02 2015 UTC,"Well the Star Wars re-releases were successes in the 90's and audiences had already seen those films before. If JP were to come out as a totally new film today then I have no doubt it would be a success, especially in this era of reboots.  I feel like I can only speak for American audiences, but I don't think we've changed that much since 1993.  If anything, post-9/11 times have made us more cynical and JP caters to that through Dr. Malcolm's skepticism.    I feel like your question is interesting OP but would be better with a more challenging subject.  JP is one of the first titles that comes to mind when I think of a timeless, universally loved film."
TrueFilm,3c5dcj,BRODUS,3,Sun Jul 5 05:43:33 2015 UTC,"I went to see it when it was re-released in 3D. I was sitting next to this couple in their late 20s-early 30s, and the girls said she had never seen Jurassic Park before.  It was impossible not to notice the rollercoaster of emotions she went trough through the whole movie: fear, excitement, joy. 20 years later, the movie still managed to touch and move people (grown-ups, nonetheless) just like it did back then. After all this time, all the technical advances in moviemaking, after the internet; the movie still worked perfectly. I think that's the absolute evidence that JP is in its own merit a masterpiece."
TrueFilm,3c5dcj,Mcpato,3,Mon Jul 6 04:12:03 2015 UTC,"JP was all about the reveal; people went to see it to 'see it' because movies like that come around only once so often.  So, given that it has already entered cinema's history, I don't think it would do as well as a Reboot. Same with Matrix, Blair Witch Project, Titanic, Dark Knight.    Of course, if Hollywood put its marketing might behind a reboot, built up the hype to nth degree (like the Star Wars re-releases) and keep on increasing ticket prices, then sure...it would be successful - they've already have the finished product for the most part; very little production costs."
TrueFilm,3c5dcj,OtterLarkin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:15:20 2015 UTC,We aren't talking about a reboot though. The question is asking if it would be a hit it made for the first time today.

It had an original plot with a new twist (the dinosaurs) and most importantly was family-friendly for the McDonald's/Walmart toy line."
TrueFilm,3c5dcj,OtterLarkin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:48:40 2015 UTC,"I think would be successful today with new CGI. At the time, the technology used in Jurassic Park was ahead of its time(both animatronics and CGI). The improvements on the CGI would be good to communicate with younger audience. I would love if they left the animatronics parts untouched because I feel like they feel very real to me, it wouldn't be as magical when the kids interact with a Brachiosaurus. Today people would understand that it's CGI and move on but there's something about the animatronic dinosaur that's very magical.  The main reason I think the movie would be successful is the plot and the ideas in the movie. The whole ""Life finds a way."" is just amazing for me and I think today's audience would appreciate a movie with less unnecessary action and more plot. When I saw Jurassic World I was very hopeful in the begining when Owen talks about how these are animals and they are alive. If the movie had went on the same line with that idea and less dinosaurs and guns it would have been better. Chris Pratt is a wonderful person and an actor he would have nailed a role that would have utilized his character as someone like Sam Neil's and Jeff Goldblum's characters. That's one of the things I love about Jurassic Park it's just dinosaurs and humans."
TrueFilm,3c4jss,bluedays,5,Sat Jul 4 18:39:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, so...  First I want to say that this is a great idea. I've actually been very interested in seeing what the important critics are saying. So I look forward to reading the essays from Pauline Kael.  But I have a few of questions:  1.) What makes an essay important? What is it's historical context? How did it change cinema? What did it do for the author's career?  2.) How do I determine what the most important essays are? For instance there is a LOT of Andrew Sarris to read online, but it's kind of overwhelming so I didn't know where to start, and thus I never did. Are there any resources that I could possible use on my own to determine what the most important essays for film criticism are? It's great to say that xyz is important for Pauline Kael but how did you determine that? I think it would be very important to explore the process of thinking which leads one to makes these determinations.  3.) Who are the critics that I should read? I know that Pauline Kael and Andrew Sarris are important for American criticism, but I have seen some names mentioned before such as Andre Bazin, Jonathan Rosenbaum, Jean-Luc Godard that you mention below."
TrueFilm,3c4jss,pursehook,4,Sun Jul 5 00:00:23 2015 UTC,"Great questions. Most of these we're going to be answering/exploring throughout the course of the month, but there are rarely any clear-cut answers to these kinds of questions. It's always a continuing critical debate.  However, in regards to the question ""who are the critics that I should read?"", you can't go wrong with any of the people I've mentioned above. To get into the basics of film criticism, Roger Ebert is a person's best bet. He's got a clear, journalistic style that means he's easy to understand and explains things rather concisely. Once you're ready to take on criticism that goes a little deeper than the Ebert level, it's a little hard to say. Many of the mods here, myself included, love the work of Andrew Sarris; start off by reading his crucial ""Notes on the Auteur Theory"" (both the 1962 and 1970 editions), which introduced la politique des auteurs into American criticism. Then, start off by reading the introductory essays and entries in The American Cinema: 1929-1968. His reasoning for why he ranks certain directors at the top Pantheon level and demotes others to the lesser levels are important to understand in order to carry on conversations today about American movies--and, really, movies in general.  There's also Jonathan Rosenbaum's great online blog, which is basically a capsule collection of all his writings over the years, there's the book The Age of Movies: Selected Writings of Pauline Kael (which we're using for this month), there's all the collections of Cahiers critics who were crucial in advancing directors like Hitchcock, Renoir, Fuller, and Hawks as cinematic forces to be reckoned with and discussed seriously.  The list goes on and on. It's a self-forming journey of discovery to find out which critics to read."
TrueFilm,3c4jss,danwroy,2,Sun Jul 5 01:50:30 2015 UTC,"Read this short essay (16 pages) about canons by Paul Schrader.  It will help you locate contemporary film criticism within a larger context of historical film criticism, historical art criticism, etc.    You will find that serious film criticism is very young.  (Convenient -- less to read.)  And, that canons are tricky, evolving things, so there is no absolute right answer.  Many of the betters critics disagree with each other.  Anyway, I think this short essay will help give you some background information and put the critics in context.  Then, you can read them critically -- that is, thinking for yourself and developing your own aesthetic point of view.  http://paulschrader.org/articles/pdf/2006-FilmComment_Schrader.pdf"

TrueFilm,3c4jss,redhopper,3,Sun Jul 5 07:48:00 2015 UTC,"Truly a fantastic opening to the essay. Can't wait to join along in watching and rewatching these movies!   Where could we better stoke the fires of our masochism than at rotten movies in gaudy seedy picture palaces in cities that run together, movies and anonymity a common denominator. Movies—a tawdry corrupt art for a tawdry corrupt world—fit the way we feel. The world doesn’t work the way the schoolbooks said it did and we are different from what our parents and teachers expected us to be. Movies are our cheap and easy expression, the sullen art of displaced persons. Because we feel low we sink in the boredom, relax in the irresponsibility, and maybe grin for a minute when the gunman lines up three men and kills them with a single bullet, which is no more “real” to us than the nursery-school story of the brave little tailor.   wow. It's an eloquent argument, even if I might not agree with it at times and it can get preachy at times. But it his real, and personal, which is rare.   And the Western shoot-’em-ups certainly weren’t the schoolteachers’ notions of art—which in my school days, ran more to didactic poetry and “perfectly proportioned” statues and which over the years have progressed through nice stories to “good taste” and “excellence”—which may be more poisonous than homilies and dainty figurines because then you had a clearer idea of what you were up against and it was easier to fight.    If not a little dated. But after that and a telling of the differences between studios (at the brink of their demise- the late 60's) she writes this fantastic paragraph about, to me at least, snobbery:   Does trash corrupt? A nutty Puritanism still flourishes in the arts, not just in the schoolteachers’ approach of wanting art to be “worthwhile,” but in the higher reaches of the academic life with those ideologues who denounce us for enjoying trash as if this enjoyment took us away from the really disturbing, angry new art of our time and somehow destroyed us. If we had to justify our trivial silly pleasures, we’d have a hard time. How could we possibly justify the fun of getting to know some people in movie after movie, like Joan Blondell, the brassy blonde with the heart of gold, or waiting for the virtuous, tiny, tiny-featured heroine to say her line so we could hear the riposte of her tough, wisecracking girlfriend (Iris Adrian was my favorite). Or, when the picture got too monotonous, there would be the song interlude, introduced “atmospherically” when the cops and crooks were both in the same never-neverland nightclub and everything stopped while a girl sang. Sometimes it would be the most charming thing in the movie, like Dolores Del Rio singing “You Make Me That Way” in “International Settlement”; sometimes it would drip with maudlin meaning, like “Oh Give Me Time for Tenderness” in “Dark Victory” with the dying Bette Davis singing along with the chanteuse. The pleasures of this kind of trash are not intellectually defensible. But why should pleasure need justification?   What she said about 2001, however, was just the opposite of what I believed. I felt she was assuming what went through Kubrick's mind and pushed her own petty hatred of the movie out there. Really off putting, but hey with 2001 you either worship it or hate it.   What’s surprising is that so many people take (The Graduate) so seriously. What’s funny about the movie are the laughs on that dumb sincere boy who wants to talk about art in bed when the woman just wants to fornicate. But then the movie begins to pander to youthful narcissism, glorifying his innocence, and making the predatory (and now crazy) woman the villainess. Commercially this works: the inarticulate dull boy becomes a romantic hero for the audience to project into with all those squishy and now conventional feelings of look, his parents don’t communicate with him; look, he wants truth not sham, and so on. But the movie betrays itself and its own expertise, sells out its comic moments that click along with the rhythm of a hit Broadway show, to make the oldest movie pitch of them all—asking the audience to identify with the simpleton who is the latest version of the misunderstood teen-ager and the pure-in-heart boy next door.   I personally think she did a poor job of explaining why The Graduate isn't something she loved- I mean it fit with her overall view but she then tried to go out on a limb and attack it some more, which I felt to be betraying her main point.    “The Graduate” is corny American; it takes us back to before “The Game of Love” with Edwige Feuillère as the sympathetic older woman and “A Cold Wind in August” with the sympathetic Lola Albright performance.         What’s interesting about the success of “The Graduate” is sociological: the revelation of how emotionally accessible modern youth is to the same old manipulation. The recurrence of certain themes in movies suggests that each generation wants romance restated in slightly new terms, and of course it’s one of the pleasures of movies as a popular art that they can answer this need. And yet, and yet—one doesn’t expect an educated generation to be so soft on itself, much softer than the factory workers of the past who didn’t go back over and over to the same movies, mooning away in fixation on themselves and thinking this fixation meant movies had suddenly become an art, and their art.   So is this against The Gradate or just the maturing of one woman into the realization of the helpless cycle of generations? It could be both."
TrueFilm,3c4jss,PMC1996,2,Sun Jul 5 01:40:06 2015 UTC,"I feel generally the same way Kael does, about The Graduate, I think, but I'm not sure I would be able to articulate it any better than she does. The only things I can think to say of it are that I found it whiny, petulant (maybe?), and I felt it promoted one particular worldview as the correct one (which I did not hold)."

TrueFilm,3c4ncq,Jon-Osterman,8,Sat Jul 4 19:10:15 2015 UTC,"I feel like several David Cronenberg films have fell victim to this.  Dead Zone, Scanners, Existenz, and A History of Violence come to mind.  They're interesting films that certainly aren't forgettable, but they all seem to suffer from some combination of bland acting and unrealistic dialogue that keeps me from being fully immersed."
TrueFilm,3c4ncq,BRODUS,4,Sat Jul 4 22:05:37 2015 UTC,"I'm with you and the commenter about A History of Violence. It just seemed very ""flat"" and almost old-school TV movie. I re-watched Eastern Promises the other day and was surprised to realise that it has a similar flatness but it seems to work far better (I really like that film).  I'm coming around to the view that Cronenberg films have interesting concepts but are actually directed very clumsily, in terms of framing, editing and acting. They aren't ""cinematic"". It works when the actors manage to push through this and let the ideas shine; otherwise you're left with something where you enjoying the idea rather than what's onscreen.  In lots of scenes, it's as if the actors haven't been given any direct and don't know what's happened previously in the script - and so they can't tell what emotional tone to give it.  This kinda works in eXistenZ because (SPOILER) everyone's meant to be a game character to varying extents (almost a pun), but that excuse only works if you think the ending of that film is still part of the game. There are tip-offs that it is, due to the shouted delivery, but the fact that I am unsure is itself an indication that I never trusted the filmmakers enough to think they were deliberately doing what they seemed to be doing, even by the end of it.  Funnily enough - Herzog's films sometimes have similar ""clumsiness"" to them but because I trust him far more (I just commented on Bad Lieutenant's greatest elsewhere) I can actively enjoy that, rather than feel wary because of it."
TrueFilm,3c4ncq,TriumphantGeorge,6,Sun Jul 5 16:23:11 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way about A History of Violence.  I understand what Cronenberg was pointing at.

Viggo Mortensen calls it the best movie he's ever been in.  Roger Ebert's review was glowing.  Maybe I'm missing something, but it just seemed plain.  I think the plainness was a directorial decision, but it still doesn't change that it's blandness wasn't enjoyable."

There was tremendous anticipation for it at the time.  That all changed pretty fast when the movie came out.  The word-of-mouth was indeed that it was generic and uninspired.

TrueFilm,3c1ejy,highmrk,13,Sun Jul 5 04:13:33 2015 UTC,"It's kinda not fair that Chinatown had to come out the same year as Godfather 2, otherwise it probably would have won Best Picture. (I think it's much better, too.) It's probably Polanski's definitive masterpiece, obviously his career was never really the same shortly after that.  You also have Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, A Woman under the Influence, & Fear Eats The Soul to look forward to. It was a terrific year for movies."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,highmrk,7,Sat Jul 4 01:18:27 2015 UTC,Woo! It seems like I can never run out of good movies to watch. I'll have to check out Blazing Saddles and Young Frakenstein soon. You reminded me that I'm fairly malnourished when it comes to older comedies before the 80's.
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,seanziewonzie,8,Sat Jul 4 01:50:58 2015 UTC,"Mel Brooks made a few of the essentials, I'd rather watch Young Frankenstein than most of the movie's it's parodying anyway. Comedies are some of the hardest old movies to choose right, though, because they kinda flop if they don't seem funny. The standard diet is Chaplin, Keaton, and Lubitsch, and I like most of the Howard Hawks comedies too.  Now that I think of it, The Pianist is one of Polanski's happier, more sentimental movies...you know, for him."

TrueFilm,3c1ejy,foreignsky,12,Sat Jul 4 04:15:28 2015 UTC,"1969...  Am I really that uncultured? I guess I have to watch ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", ""Midnight Cowboy"", ""The Wild Bunch"", ""Z"", ""The Army of Shadows"", ""Kes"", or ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"".  Edit: Seems like quite a few Westerns in 1969. I don't watch many Westerns. For some reason it doesn't resonate with me. Could it be because I'm not American?"
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,LoopyLion,14,Sun Jul 5 00:58:20 2015 UTC,"While Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a western in setting, it's really more of a buddy movie involving one of the best duos ever: Newman and Redford. I'd recommend it even if you're not a western fan."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,peteroh9,2,Sat Jul 4 02:48:36 2015 UTC,"I really liked Redford in The Sting, and I just realized it has Katharine Ross from The Graduate. She's really pretty. I didn't realize she was Dr. Lilian Thurman from Donnie Darko. I wonder why her catalogue is so sparse? It seems like she was a perfectly fine actress to me. She won a couple Globes too, and got nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar. Quite a few of these great actors kind of fizzled, it seems. I would've thought they would've continued acting well into their older years, if they had the ability to."

TrueFilm,3c1ejy,merdada,2,Sat Jul 4 08:57:59 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a great year for movies. Easy Rider and Butch Cassidy are the main American ones people still watch, and Z is the big foreign language one. Putney Swope is probably good too."

TrueFilm,3c1ejy,pursehook,3,Sat Jul 4 14:10:33 2015 UTC,"It was a great year for subversive and decadent cinema worldwide. I'm not a fan of a few that are well-liked among cinephiles, like Vtackovia, siroty a blazni (Czech, surreal and colorful, political subtext, tragic love triagle, bizarre all around), Fellini - Satyricon (5 hours of orgies supposedly in the ancient Rome? can't recall much), Bara no sôretsu (Japanese, violent and radical, new wave, queer cinema) and Sayat Nova (extremely unique, surreal, spiritual).  But there's also Kenneth Anger's undeciperable occult nonsense Invocation of My Demon Brother; Pasolini was in his best form with ultradramatic Medea and no-holds-barred politically subversive Porcile featuring cannibalism, Ugo Tognazzi and Marco Ferreri as modern-day ex-Nazi capitalists and Jean-Pierre Léaud getting eaten by his beloved pigs; Ferreri has crafted what is probably his best film, a free-form aesthetic feast Dillinger è morto where Michel Piccoli finds all kinds of infantile ways to suppress his dissatisfaction with modern way of life; Fassbinder already showed his genius and ability to find hilarity in ugliness and sprinkle it all with social criticism in his early masterpiece Katzelmacher; and Visconti has managed to depict unspeakable levels of aristocratic decay and Third Reich-flavoured rot in La caduta degli dei. Tichý týden v dome, Svankmajer's short from that year is also notable, maybe not as inspired in its surreal imagery as his top work, but it's framed in interesting political commentary.  Oh, and Rohmer also shot his sublime intellectual morality tale Ma nuit chez Maud that with the rest of his career would provide an inexhaustible source of, ahem, inspiration for Woody Allen and Richard Linklater, but its exploration of Christian morality is rather tame compared to those above."

So Singing in the Rain, Moulin Rouge, and Ikiru, all of which I've been wanting to see for quite a while."

TrueFilm,3c1ejy,FletchDoesNotLive,35,Sat Jul 4 10:30:28 2015 UTC,"1947.  It was a pretty weak year for American movies, with the only notable one being Miracle on 34th Street (which I haven't seen) and Out of the Past (a Jacques Tourneur/Bob Mitchum film noir I've still got on my list).  But yeah, it's pretty surprising; I've seen at least 3 films from every year between 1919 to 2015, except for 1947, where I haven't seen any films at all.  Some things to put on the watchlist:   Monsieur Verdoux (Chaplin) The Lady from Shanghai (O. Welles) Black Narcissus (Powell and Pressburger) The Woman on the Beach (Renoir) Fun and Fancy Free (one of those forgotten Disney package films they did in the 40s and early 50s)"

TrueFilm,3c1ejy,montypython22,4,Sat Jul 4 01:54:23 2015 UTC,I created a Letterboxd list called Favorite film of each year 1948 to present.  I chose 1948 as the starting point because I too hadn't seen a single film from 1947.
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,fannyoch,4,Sat Jul 4 02:52:32 2015 UTC,"I was almost 1947, too. I had to go to page 4 on Letterboxd to find The Fabulous Dorseys and Cab Calloway in Hi-De-Ho.  1937 may or may not be my year, depending on a few things. There are three candidates for movies that may or may not count. The first is Snow White, which I'm told by my mother was the first film I saw in a theater, although I have no memory of it, so I don't know if it would count. The second is The Grand Illusion, which I know was on my film syllabus in college, but once more, I have no memory of it, so I may have skipped that day. The third is SOS Coast Guard, which is a serial and not a movie, and I've only watched a couple episodes of it, so once more: not sure if I should count it.  However, if we decide to count one of those, my year is 1918. I feel pretty good about that. It was kind of a crap year, anyway, what with Europe in ruins and a pandemic sweeping the globe.  If we go with 1937, I think Snow White and The Grand Illusion are my starting points. If we go with 1918, then I definitely want to see I Don't Want to Be a Man and The Eyes of the Mummy with Are Crooks Dishonest? getting honorable mention for having an awesome title."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,ryl00,2,Fri Jul 3 22:26:45 2015 UTC,"Add Make Way for Tomorrow to that list. One of my dear favorites from the 30s Hollywood. That movie could be made today and it wouldn't have any of the charm, style, or emotion that McCarey mustered up in 1937. It's also a real tearjerker."

I mean it's 'just' a comedy, and it's been ages since I last saw any of the Hope/Crosby Road movies (so this may just be nostalgia talking), but if you like that style (and I do), they're a pleasant enough way to spend a couple of hours.  Hope and Crosby really had great chemistry together on-screen."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,ronfrakkingswanson1,3,Sat Jul 4 14:51:21 2015 UTC,The only reason I've seen a film from 1947 is because one of my middle school teachers made us watch The Secret Life of Walter Mitty on the last day of school.

TrueFilm,3c1ejy,ginningmosquitoes,2,Sat Jul 4 06:29:19 2015 UTC,"There's a woefully forgotten American experimental film by Hans Richter and a bunch of his old-school dadaist friends, Dreams That Money Can Buy (1947). Not without its flaws (as inconsistent as all anthology films), but on the whole very original, with a cozy-endearing ironic tone and at the same time a menacing nightmare underneath. It also predates Inception and Avatar with blue-skinned people navigating complex dream structures. :)   Berlin-born Hans Richter - Dadaist, painter, film theorist and filmmaker - was for four decades one of the most influential members of the cinematic avant-garde. Richter assembled some of the century's liveliest artists as co-creators of Dreams That Money Can Buy, his most ambitious attempt to bring the work of the European avant-garde to a wider cinema audience. Among its admirers is film director David Lynch.  Joe, a young man down on his luck, discovers he has the power to create dreams, and sets up a business selling them to others. The 'dreams' he gives to his clients are the creations of Max Ernst, Fernand Léger, Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp, Alexander Calder and Richter himself, and the result is by turns playful, hypnotic, satirical, charming and nightmarish.

There doesn't seem to be any available films made earlier than 1887 according to IMDb and Wikipedia, so that's what I came down to. Now I can't answer your question of what I want to see the most either, hah."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,bg-j38,8,Sun Jul 5 00:54:19 2015 UTC,I find this hard to believe.
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,Mothravka,30,Fri Jul 3 22:34:30 2015 UTC,I don't. The internet is a beautiful thing.
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,bg-j38,16,Sat Jul 4 06:27:07 2015 UTC,"I don't. I just looked through an IMDb dump (I've rated everything I've ever seen) and I've seen a feature film from every year back to 1924 with the exception of 1928. It gets spotty after 1924 with a few here and there. I've never really been a huge fan of the silent era though it's something I want to explore more. If we want to take 1906 as the first year of dramatic feature films (The Story of the Kelly Gang -- though apparently it's partially lost) I could probably bang out every missing year in a week if I was dedicated.  Now OP just said film though, not feature film. So if we just take that to mean ""something that was put on film"" then I've seen something from every year that IMDb has entries for except 1917 and possibly 1889. First, to correct /u/Mothravka slightly, IMDb has two films from earlier than 1887 listed. 1878's Sallie Gardner at a Gallop and 1874's Passage de Venus. If these are technically films I imagine could be up for some debate but I defer to IMDb. They're both on YouTube so they're easy to watch.  1889 is a little complicated. There's two films listed but both seem to have been lost. There's also the Edison Monkeyshines films of which it's unclear as to if they're from 1889 or 1890. In either case they're easy to find copies of.  Now I guess the question is, what should I watch from 1917?"
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,merdada,8,Sat Jul 4 07:48:24 2015 UTC,"Now I guess the question is, what should I watch from 1917?       Umirayushchii lebed (1917) by Yevgeni Bauer! The English title is The Dying Swan. I think he's a director from the silent days that really needs more recognition. If I remember correctly, the movie is also available on YouTube. A very beautiful little melodrama with a great dance sequence and a captivating story. Bauer also had some interesting techniques when it came to tinting and double exposures. Do not miss this! Probably my favourite film of the ones before the 1920s.      Also, two honorable mentions are Tösen från Stormyrtorpet (1917) and Terje Vigen (1917), both directed by Victor Sjöström."

TrueFilm,3c1ejy,drevill,10,Sat Jul 4 22:40:03 2015 UTC,"1956  I honestly don't see that many I'm dying to see beyond the top 2 or 3 I'm about to list, but I will keep an open mind if anyone has any ideas. Also I'm not sure if this is what this post was intended for, but I'd like to give some some quick thoughts on why I want to see these  films as well if that's alright.   The Searchers (John Ford) - This one I am honestly really excited for, the only John Ford I've seen so far though was The Grapes of Wrath, so I feel like I'm kind of saving this until I've seen a few more and can really appreciate it. I don't think I've ever seen a full John Wayne movie either, so again, I'd rather see something like their earlier collaboration on Stagecoach before I get around to this one. Otherwise I'd probably be watching it right now. Early Spring (Ozu) - As far as Ozu goes, I've only seen I Was Born, But... and it blew me away. I was incredibly entertained by it, which I didn't expect since it was only my 2nd feature length silent film after Metropolis (Technically my 3rd feature length silent if you count The Artist) and I was still a little worried about my attention span without sound. Long story short, I am now 100% into the idea of watching more silent films and now that I know how great Ozu can be without sound, its just got me even more excited to get into his sound era films! The Man Who Knew Too Much (Alfred Hitchcock) - I love the Hitchcock films I have seen so far (The 39 Steps, Rope, Vertigo, Psycho, Rear Window, Foreign Correspondent and Strangers on a Train), but I haven't figured out my plan of attack for the rest yet. Should I go for this one since I'm sure I'd like it, and I know now that 1956 is a gap year for me? Or should I just watch North by Northwest asap? Tough to decide. Last Pair Out (Alf Sjoberg) - Honestly, I am only excited about this because Ingmar Bergman wrote it. If Bergman had a film come out as a director in 1956 I probably would have this year covered already. I've been in love with every one of his films that I have seen (although so far I have stuck with his 1957 - 1969 output exclusively) and I hope to see the rest as soon as possible now that he has probably become my favourite director. The Killing (Stanley Kubrick) - I haven't made it back to early Kubrick yet, but I am looking forward to seeing this one eventually.   So TrueFilm, 1956 eh? Is it just the year that was too late for Film Noir and too early for French New Wave? Or could this be a hidden gem of a year for film? Please feel free to recommend me more titles from '56! I'm sure there are a lot more than what I came up with, and I'm looking forward to finally seeing what this year in film had to offer!"
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,doubledoverweeds,9,Sat Jul 4 23:38:24 2015 UTC,The Searchers is definitely the big one from that year. I would have told you to see Stagecoach first but you seem to know what you're doing. Bigger than Life is another fun one from that year.  I still haven't seen The Red Balloon or The Ten Commandments except maybe a long time ago as a child.
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,ewiethoff,3,Fri Jul 3 23:01:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions, I definitely want to dive into Stagecoach soon, it seems like an important film in a lot of ways. Hearing that Orson Welles watched it countless times before making Citizen Kane adds to the desire I have to watch it too. Do you think it is a stand out film in John Ford's work? Or does his best come later on?  I have thought about watching The Ten Commandments, but I'm not sure if I'm a biblical epic guy, I guess the only way to find out is to jump in head first as soon as I have the chance. And The Red Balloon I haven't even heard of aside from the name, so that is an awesome off the radar recommendation."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,montypython22,6,Fri Jul 3 23:12:51 2015 UTC,"Stagecoach is one of Ford's many masterpieces and perhaps his first truly great movie (Young Mr. Lincoln came out the same year.) But it's also one of his least subversive movies if that makes sense. That's why it has to be watched first, because John Wayne's character in The Searchers is a riff on his basic persona from earlier movies and he didn't start getting more demanding roles until the 40s.  Much as people like to give DeMille crap, his stuff is usually still worth seeing today.  The Red Balloon is one of those obligatory European art movies, I think."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,jam66539,8,Fri Jul 3 23:33:45 2015 UTC,"Samurai III: Duel at Ganryu Island but I'd recommend you watch Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto (1954) and Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple (1955) first. I think Samurai III would stand on its own but it's a bit like The Lord of the Rings - one giant story about one man. Really great work from Toshiro Mifune in the lead role and Hiroshi Inagaki is someone whose films I hope I get to see more of.  As for the rest of 1956 - Giant and The King and I are both worth checking out...and The Ten Commandments, if only because it's a film that truly deserves the label epic."

An all-out loving assault on them crazy kids and their rock'n'roll by the Underrated Master of Hollywood Satire, Frank Tashlin. He got his start as a Looney Tunes director, working with such greats as Bob Clampett and Chuck Jones, before transitioning into Hollywood with his feature film debut Son of Paleface in 1952. It's got a very Looney Tunes-ian feel to it, it's fast-paced, quick-witted, with incredibly memorable performances (including Jayne Mansfield as a hyper-dumb parody of herself....with a touch of Marilyn Monroe), and it comes with one of the greatest cumshot jokes you'll ever see.   It's hilarious, and if you like the early days of rock'n'roll, you'll be delighted at the cameo performances of some of the early greats, like Little Richard and Gene Vincent.  Check out the opening sequence, which manages to (lovingly, mind you) shit on Fantasia and Disney, rock'n'roll, and Technicolor in one go..  Also check out A Man Escaped by Bresson, released the same year. We recently did a Bresson thread, so check that out to see if Bresson's the type of cinema you'd be interested in.   Should I go for this one since I'm sure I'd like it, and I know now that 1956 is a gap year for me? Or should I just watch North by Northwest asap? Tough to decide.   Crazily enough, Man Who Knew Too Much '56 is in my top 5 favorite Hitch movies. It's like a lite-Hitch showcase of everything the man was capable of: nail-biting suspense, cheeky black humor, surprisingly powerful performances that stay with you long after the movie's over. Now this isn't the master at his peak, of course; it's an unpretentious adventure-espionage movie. You won't find the deep psychological ruminations of Psycho and The Birds here, but it's a hugely entertaining picture nonetheless; which was what Hitch was concerned about, first and foremost."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,ronfrakkingswanson1,3,Sat Jul 4 23:00:19 2015 UTC,"The Girl Can't Help It sounds like it could be up my alley for sure. And I've never even heard of it before, so good job on that recommendation!   A Man Escaped, and Bresson in general sounds incredibly interesting to me, and if you don't mind, I have a handful of questions about him. In that thread you mentioned that he was among your favourite directors right? Is there anyone else you would put in that conversation?  Also from your post in that thread:   But this is how Bresson's worldview works. He LIKES sparsity and cleanness. He would often ask his actors to perform the same scene 60 times in a row, until all pretensions of acting and ""constructedness"" would disappear and what would be left were the words, plain and simple.   Forgive my ignorance of Bresson, but is what you are talking about kind of like an earlier version of David Fincher style wise? The overabundance of takes, a sparse clean visual style... or am I just catching buzz words? I am so woefully unaware of Bresson that I don't even have a starting point for a comparison. Is there even a good director to compare him to?   As for Hitchcock, you've sold me on it. I think The Man Who Knew Too Much is going to move to the top of my Hitchcock watch list."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,fannyoch,6,Fri Jul 3 23:18:17 2015 UTC,"Is there anyone else you would put in that conversation?   Oof, that's a big question. Well, I've thought about this a lot: I have my personal favorites (Jacques Demy, Richard Lester--whose movie Petulia we'll be showcasing in the TrueFilm Theater next week!), but as far as people who I'd rank among Bresson's company, I have a couple to mention:   Jacques Tati. Each one of his 6 films is a comic delight. But he doesn't eke belly laughs out from you; usually they're minor chuckles, oftentimes you may not laugh in one of his movies at all. His films are all relaxing, unforceful satires of the travails of modern living. Easily my favorite director for many reasons: his movies have some of the most consistently formidable mise-en-scenes in cinema history, his sense of comedic timing is impeccable, he gently nudges you about your own hangups in the modern age without ever coming off as old-man-ish or holier-than-thou. Look into watching his films in this order: Jour de Fete (1949)--Les Vacances de M. Hulot (1953)--Mon Oncle (1958)--Trafic (1971)--Play Time (1967; this is his unabashed masterpiece, imho)--Parade (1974). Yasujiro Ozu. He's actually very similar to Tati. Gentle social dramas that sometimes veer into profound melodrama, his characters are grounded in a sense of propriety, always trying to uphold the status quo even as time quietly changes the way society functions. Tokyo Story (1953), An Autumn Afternoon (1962), Late Autumn (1960), Floating Weeds (1959) and I Was Born, But (1932) along with its color remake Good Morning (1959) are all highly recommended. John Cassavetes. A New Hollywood maverick who didn't give two shits about studio filmmaking and, in his daring feature-films, stripped his movies of conventional structure and character development. He's very interested in the state of marriage in modern America, as well as the psychological hangups of the middle-to-upper-middle-class. His films are almost always affecting; his Killing of a Chinese Bookie is one of the best deflations of classical masculinity in the movies. Somebody else on here mentioned 1974 as being one of the years they haven't seen any movie from, and then cited Chinatown and Godfather Part II as being the first contenders to watch from that year. For my money, the best film of 1974 was A Woman Under the Influence, which we highlighted for Marriage May this year. It is an emotional experience unlike any other if you let free your conceptions of what movies are supposed to do.    I could go on and mention other hard-hitters (late Billy Wilder, Chaplin of course, Douglas Sirk--in particular, his Imitation of Life [1959] which will make you cry like you've never cried before in a movie), but I think I'll stop there before I get ahead of myself!"
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,jam66539,3,Fri Jul 3 23:52:33 2015 UTC,"Wow, these are both really detailed and well thought out replies! I really appreciate the insights into Bresson and the other directors you mentioned as well. It definitely shows how far I still have to go in my cinema journey when out of Demy, Lester, Tati, Ozu, Cassavetes, Wilder, Sirk and Bresson I have only seen two films (Umbrellas of Cherbourg and I Was Born, But.), both of which were great, but still....only two? I thought I'd come a long way in my knowledge of film, but I've definitely got a long road ahead still!  I guess to kind of show where I'm at right now, if I named my current favourites, they would probably be Ingmar Bergman, Alfred Hitchcock, David Fincher and Martin Scorsese, but since I haven't even scratched the surface of so many great directors (or even completely finished any of those 4) yet, I think its probably still too early to tell.   Anyway, thanks again for the great answers! Its awesome that people like you in this subreddit take the time to help out and make recommendations to people like me who haven't seen as many great films yet."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,fannyoch,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:53:35 2015 UTC,"Forgive my ignorance of Bresson, but is what you are talking about kind of like an earlier version of David Fincher style wise? The overabundance of takes, a sparse clean visual style... or am I just catching buzz words? I am so woefully unaware of Bresson that I don't even have a starting point for a comparison. Is there even a good director to compare him to?   No worries. Though I really love Fincher, I wouldn't compare him to Bresson. Fincher's cinema is deliberately mechanical: very slick, sharp-tongued protagonists, and a whole lotta pessimistic bleakness about modern society that can verge on nihilism at times. His movies are also very grounded in a specific era--the modern digital age. A lot of people compare Fincher to Hitchcock, but really the essence of a Fincher movie rests in how he can manipulate digital cinema to his will: from the Reznor-Ross minimalist-bloop scores, to the doubling of one actor as two twins in The Social Network, to the unnatural way he moves his gliding, Gods'-eye-POV camera in Zodiac, I can't imagine a Fincher working in any era other than today's. In Zodiac, he even manages to make the 60s--historically known in the cinema as being a time of flower-power and often charged with looking ""crumbily dated"" today--look like the 2010s.  Bresson, on the other hand, is FAR mellower and far looser in terms of the look on his film. Fincher still prides himself on rigid compositions; a Bresson film feels like he shot his subjects straight-on, in-the-moment, without any consideration for cinematic composition or rule of 3rds or what have you.  A better modern equivalent to compare Bresson to is Richard Linklater, especially in his last film Boyhood. In both cases, you have extremely naturalistic (almost simplistic) performances stripped of any pretensions of ""acting"", along with a visual knack that is less insistent on conventional rules of cinematic grammar, and more reliant on empty spaces and simple, clean shots of people. Because they forsake a rigid style for a looser feel reliant on inexplicable emotions, they come out looking much ""simpler"" than their contemporaries. Though, in both instances, there's almost nothing simple about a Bresson world or the world Linklater conjures in Boyhood."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,ryl00,5,Sat Jul 4 03:08:59 2015 UTC,I thought Wes Anderson was the guy we associated with Bressonian acting these days.
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,awesomeness0232,6,Sat Jul 4 02:04:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry but Richard Linklater is a TERRIBLE comparison. Your descriptions of how Bresson shoots his films implies that they're loosely constructed, when in actual fact his cinema is some of the most perfectly realised I've ever seen. Every shot works towards creating a space, developing a character, or immersing us in a scene (his sound design is also absolutely meticulous). His stories are simple, but within them he attempts to find some kind of universal truth. Also Bresson wasn't a director who was in love with his actors the way Linklater is; he intentionally forced them to be as unemotive and rigid as possible. His sharp focus on the poetry of physical action paired with his affected emotional landscapes creates some kind of other-wordly reality.  Linklater is much more akin to someone like Rohmer."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,pursehook,4,Sat Jul 4 04:26:08 2015 UTC,If Bergman is your favorite director and you haven't seen any of his films post-1969... I am incredibly excited for you. Fanny and Alexander and Cries and Whispers are two of the best films I've seen.  And I hope you enjoy The Searchers. Many people I know found it underwhelming but I absolutely love it.
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,loufoquerie,2,Sat Jul 4 06:23:41 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah maybe I am a bit premature on picking him as my favourite since I've only seen 8 films of his from a 12 year period, but 1957 to 1966 has to be one of the best decades for any director that I can think of. The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries, The Virgin Spring,  Through a Glass Darkly, Winter Light, The Silence and Persona! Wow! And the 1969 film of his that I've seen is The Passion of Anna which I also loved.   I am incredibly excited for Fanny and Alexander and Cries and Whispers for sure! I'm leaning towards watching the 5 hour version of Fanny and Alexander first since I already know I love his style of film making, but 5 hours is a long time for one film, so I haven't got around to it yet. I will probably watch the long version first for Scenes from a Marriage  too once I get to it.  Also, based on your user name I think you might be the right guy to ask. Are there any real standout Bergman films from before 1957? I want to work my way through his 40's and 50's catalog as well someday, but I don't hear as much about them."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,A_Largo_Edwardo,2,Sat Jul 4 14:56:38 2015 UTC,I adore Summer Interlude and Summer With Monika though many prefer Smiles of a Summer Night for early Bergman.  You should absolutely watch the 5 hour version of F&A. There's no contest and Bergman far preferred the longer cut. The theatrical version cuts out a lot of the magical realism and more wondrous moments.
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,loufoquerie,3,Sat Jul 4 15:32:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's considered by critics as lesser Sirk (and I'm not terribly familiar with his filmography, so I can't comment on that), but There's Always Tomorrow is a good film from 1956.  It's a (rare?) melodrama from a man's point of view, as Fred MacMurray plays a middle-aged breadwinner who feels trapped in his seemingly idealistic suburban life.  Absolutely crushing ending."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,BhodiandUtah,3,Sat Jul 4 20:14:40 2015 UTC,"I mean if you like John Ford and/or John Wayne and/or the Western genre, you'll love Searchers. The Man Who Knew Too Much is on my watch list as well. I feel pretty confident it's awesome (as all Hitchcock movies are). However, you should probably watch North By Northwest. It's an incredible movie even by Hitchcock standards. For me it's easily in my top two or three favorite Hitchcock films."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,A_Largo_Edwardo,3,Sat Jul 4 00:54:26 2015 UTC,"Bob Le Flambeur -- I think it is my favorite Melville.  It is a really fun one.  (Watch this way before the Kubrick film.)  Also, while I hate to agree with Monty, The Girl Can't Help It is really good, most of all because of the musicians shown in the film.  We watched it once in the TrueFilm theater, and it was so fun for the music that I put it on my watch annually list (my imaginary list)."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,pursehook,7,Sat Jul 4 01:12:58 2015 UTC,"1970.  Obviously need to see Patton, MASH, The Confession, Le Cercle Rouge, Five Easy Pieces, The Conformist, Performance, Wanda.  Struggled to find other years. Next year was 1930. Need to see All Quiet on the Western Front, Hell's Angels, L'age d'or.  Really struggle with films pre-1930. Seen Metropolis in 1927. The General in '26. Battleship in '25. Nosferatu in '22. Cabinet of Dr. Caligari in '20. Nothing else before that (expect short films that are less than a minute in length or Georges Méliès films (A Trip to the Moon in 1902, for example). Considering I'm quite young, it's not so bad."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,ryl00,3,Sat Jul 4 20:50:54 2015 UTC,"Mines is 1970 as well.  The films I'm wanting to see are The Conformist, The Wild Child, Goin’ Down the Road and Let it Be.  I'm holding off on MASH because I'm not sure whether to watch the television show before or after the movie."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,pistolpierre,3,Sat Jul 4 05:40:40 2015 UTC,Well the MASH movie came first. The TV show was inspired by the Robert Altman film. Best to see that first?
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,seanziewonzie,3,Sat Jul 4 07:14:34 2015 UTC,"Definitely watch the film first. The television show was a watered down, lesser version of Altman's picture.

TrueFilm,3c1ejy,EcoleBuissonniere,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:30:47 2015 UTC,"An update: just watched MASH.  It's great, it's one of those pictures which, although don't make you burst into laughter makes you have a constant grin on your face while watching it.  It's easy to forget it's even a war film in fact, more times than not I feel like it's a satire on the American way of life."

The two big ones on my list from that year are Days of Heaven (which I own but haven't gotten around to yet) and Autumn Sonata (I'm watching Ingmar Bergman's filmography by splitting it into four periods and watching his most relevant films from each; right now I'm watching the third period I have set, which is the 60's, so basically everything he made after The Virgin Spring but before Cries and Whispers). I'm also going to see The Deer Hunter when I finally get to going through New Hollywood (which I'll do eventually, I swear!), as well as Interiors once I scrape together the money to buy a bunch of Woody Allen films."

So if that counts for 1945, then I haven't seen any movies in 1944. Otherwise, I haven't seen any movies in 1945.  The film I most want to see from 1945 is, I suppose, The Lost Weekend. For 1944, Double Indemnity for sure. Also, Arsenic and Old Lace and Meet Me in St. Louis.  I feel like I may have seen Anchors Aweigh from 1945, but I really don't remember, so I'm not counting it. But that one is also probably a fun watch. If that counted, and if The Three Caballeros counted for 1944, then my year probably jumps back to 1936. And, if Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor counted, back to 1934.  Also, I think I actually own The Invisible Man's Revenge from 1944, but I haven't watched it.  Due to the Marx Brothers I've probably seen at least one movie in a lot of the years before these, too. And there were several close calls in later years where I was saved by a random Peter Sellers film or Disney film, etc. Also, the ""Classic Movie Series"" at the local theater has helped a bit."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,drevill,4,Sun Jul 5 01:14:03 2015 UTC,"Arsenic and Old Lace is legitimately laugh out loud funny even to this day. A year or so ago I saw it at a small pre-WW2 built theatre with a drop down screen and a crowd of about 50-70 and we laughed so much we almost drowned out the movie at times. Probably a top 5 to 10 comedy all time for me. If you enjoy black humour and/or Cary Grant, I'm sure you'll love it too.  Also, you can't go wrong with Double Indemnity either."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,qpzm333,2,Sat Jul 4 04:34:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I had kind of the same experience with Some Like It Hot, with everyone in the theater cracking up.

TrueFilm,3c1ejy,peteroh9,3,Sat Jul 4 16:11:13 2015 UTC,"1949  Up until around 1960 I was pretty much golden. My theory for this is because the 60s was the rise of New Hollywood and the start of modern film techniques. Plus I feel like a lot of focus is put on post-60s films.  I still just about scraped through the 50s due to Hitchcock, musicals, westerns and Disney films. Basically movies so classic that we even watch them now.  Once you enter the 40s that's when the men are separated from the boys. I consider myself to have watched a lot of movies but I've barely touched the 40s.   The Third Man is the movie from that year I probably should have seen but haven't."

The first year that I can count that I haven't seen anything of at all is 1943. That year has three films on my list: Shadow of a Doubt, Day of Wrath, and the Ox Bow Incident.  Hitchcock called Shadow of a doubt his finest work and while listening to Secret History of Hollywood I realized that I hadn't really seen many Hitchcock films, specifically only 7 of his pictures. And almost all were in film classes.  Day of Wrath just looked haunting because of the poster, so I added it.  And Ox Bow because I watched Grapes of Wrath and Darling Clementine and I wanted to see more Henry Fonda movies."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,Ross5512,4,Sun Jul 5 01:10:37 2015 UTC,Day of Wrath is one of the most unsettling horror movies I've ever seen. Shadow of a Doubt is one of the major Hitchcock's for a reason.  I haven't seen Ox-Bow yet but it's hard to run out of Henry Fonda movies. He was in so many fantastic pictures starting in the late 30s.
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,FletchDoesNotLive,3,Fri Jul 3 23:13:35 2015 UTC,"Children of Paradise should be added to your watch list for 1945.   As for 1943 I haven't seen Day of Wrath or The Ox Bow Incident. What I can recommend from that year though is The Life & Death of Colonel Blimp and Jane Eyre (the way Orson says, ""Jane"" is sublime). I'm pretty sure I've seen Shadow of a Doubt but it's been quite a few years."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,FletchDoesNotLive,2,Fri Jul 3 23:20:59 2015 UTC,Ox Bow is not your typical western. It's one of the early influences on the 60s/70s acid westerns too so I'd recommend it strongly.

It's got one of his more unique plots--a shoe-exec (Toshiro Mifune) must put up the ransom for his chauffeur's son when the son is kidnapped by a bunch of extortionists. Contempt: Now let me preface this by saying that I don't like Godard. I'm one of the more vociferous anti-Godard people on this subreddit. Hated Vivre sa Vie and, most recently, Band of Outsiders, can't stand Breathless, etc. However, the one exception I've come across is this beautifully enchanting film he made. It's his most ""commercial""--starring the sexy, buxom starlet Brigitte Bardot--and it details the marital strife between a screenwriter (Michel Piccolli) and his wife (Bardot), who seems to have been pushed into an affair with an annoying Hollywood producers (Jack Palance) BY the screenwriter himself. The producer is in Italy with his script-girl-assistant (Giorgia Moll) to produce a cheap Odyssey knock-off picture....directed by none other than Fritz ""M"" Lang. It's so much more than that, of course, but this is without a doubt Godard's shining moment: it's breathtaking in its insights on marriage and emptiness in relationships, it has a strikingly subtle use of space and light (provided by Raoul Coutard), and it features an ending that'll leave you thinking for days on end. The Nutty Professor: My favorite Jerry Lewis picture. We actually just did a thread about this movie and Lewis a few days ago, you're welcome to check it out.   I second Hadri's suggestion of The Big City. A humanist (and feminist!) triumph about life in Calcutta, featuring an absolutlely DYNAMITE performance from Madhabi Mukharjee."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,ryl00,2,Sat Jul 4 03:03:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I was almost sure High and Low was in '63. Got into Kurosawa relatively recently, I started to watch High and Low but never finished it. I really fuckin' dug it though from I watched. I'm gonna get through the Mifune/Kurosawa collabs soon enough.  I'll definitely check out Contempt, I respect your opinion on Goddard and it intrigues me more to check it out. Let me ask if you are a fan of A Woman is a Woman? It's the most ""commercial"" of his movies that I've seen.  Never seen a Jerry Lewis starring picture, bit of a shame. I'll watch 'em eventually and most likely start with The Nutty Professor."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,TrickyTiger,3,Sat Jul 4 04:57:47 2015 UTC,"If you want movie stars, Charade. Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn should have played against each other more often.  Kuosawa, Bergman, and Ray all made major movies this year: High&Low, Winter Light and The Big City. Along with 8 /12 that makes it a great year for non-English stuff.  Edit: Also Visconti's The Leopard, but I haven't seen it yet,"
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,montypython22,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:45:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'll definitely watch Charade, I'm a huge fan of both their works. Looking it up, I saw that there was a remake in '02 by Johnathan Demme with Whalberg and Thandie Newton, looks horrible and I'll stick with the original.  I went into High and Low in the other reply, but the other two are noted. I'm gonna shame myself here more and say I haven't seen a Bergman film yet. Yeah I know, fuck me and go bring my casualness somewhere else, but clearly I'm not happy with it. I plan on doing a marathon of his career, I'm in the midst of doing that with a few directors already, but believe me Bergman is something I've been itching for. Not gonna lie and say I've also never seen an Indian or Bollywood picture, My world cinema only expands to Europe and Russia (Tarkovsky is ma dogg!!!). I mean I'v only started exploring Japanese cinema this year, which previously my only exposure to it was Godzilla and other monster films. India's cinema, along with China's and more of Russia's are one's i'm regrettably ignorant of.  The Leopard, a three hour long period piece drama in a foreign language? I've been amazed, but also bored to death before. This is the most out-there recommendation for me and might be the first on I watch out of them. Love for cinema comes out when I expand my boundaries and find a picture that completely goes against any notions I had of it."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,Slimy_Hog,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:46:48 2015 UTC,"I wasn't recommending The Leopard but the main reason to be curious about it is that it was an inspiration for The Godfather and a bunch of other New Hollywood movies.  Bergman's an acquired taste. But if you can sit through Tarkovsky you can probably take on anything.  As for Bollywood, Lagaan is usually the entry point for the mainstream kind, but if you want great art movies, Pather Panchali and the sequels are the way to go. You don't really need to be 'into' Indian movies yet to start with Ray, that's what's great about him."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,ryl00,3,Sat Jul 4 15:19:08 2015 UTC,"1965. A bit surprising considering how many directors were at their peak in the 60s and my next blank year is '43. Bergman didn't release anything in '65 so that would have something to do with it. Alphaville, Pierrot Le Fou, Repulsion and Juliet Of The Spirits are definitely on my to-watch list. I saw The Sound Of Music when I was a kid, but I can't really remember anything about it other than that 'I am 16 going on 17' song. Is Doctor Zhivago worth watching?"
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,MoeHartman,3,Sat Jul 4 15:38:13 2015 UTC,"You won't hear much praise from my end about the two Godards, but I can recommend to you two gems from 1965 that are (for the most part) largely underseen today:   Le Bonheur: Agnes Varda directed this striking French New Wave masterpiece that, in some ways, can be seen as a companion piece with her husband Jacques Demy's candy-coated musical-romance The Umbrellas of Cherbourg of the earlier year. On paper, there’s not much meat to the story. A carpenter named François has a wife, Marie, and two kids—a boy and a girl. They are a happy family, defined by the type of sickeningly maudlin sweetness that one would find in the most perverse of Disney films, not a feminist work by the French New Wave auteur Agnes Varda. But it's the WAY Varda approaches these characters, along with a devious twist halfway through the film, that really floored me when I first saw it. She is raising some important questions which have been in the back of my mind ever since I saw it a couple months ago, questions like ""How do I define my own happiness?"" and ""How do I know that the happiness I feel with a person is true happiness?"" It gets you to think without ever seeming full of itself. It's marvelous, and it's one of the best-shot films the New Wave has to offer (along with Demy's The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and Godard's Contempt). Tokyo Olympiad: This one's a bit harder to find, but it's well worth the search. It is a documentary by Kon Ichikawa on the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics...and it's one of the best sports movies ever made. Not only because Ichikawa (at a massive 3 hours) diligently records every major sporting event at the 1964 Olympics, but because he doesn't make it about the countries and USA-beating-China or what-have-you. He presents the human side of the athletes with as much pathos as you can provide as an objective documentarian not allowed to interview the athletes. And it's worth the price of admission to see the hilarious duck-waddling of the athlethes in the Speed Walking competition. The Great Race: Two guys. Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon) and The Great Leslie (Tony Curtis). 2000 miles. An impossible west-bound trip 'round the world from New York to Paris in proto-Wacky Races vehicles. One gal. A stern suffragette who tags along for the wild ride and whose alliance depends upon which guy notices her when she manipulatively bats her shiny, sleek, Natalie Wood eyes. Will they make it? Who will win? Who will lose? And why does the fate of our heroes depend upon their menage-a-quatre in the Arctic tundra while a polar bear hungrily looms above their heads? All questions raised by Blake Edwards's certifiably loony comedy from 1965 based on the epic-road-race genre that was set off in 1963 by Stanley Kramer's It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World. While I perversely like that film, I think it's pretty lousily directed at times. This is the better, more polished version of what Mad Mad World would look like in a perfect world. The second half is actually one of the best comebacks I've seen a movie make in a while. It was going pretty terribly....and then, VOOM! Jack Lemmon rebounds with a strong dual performance, and Edwards goes Lubitsch. Very highly recommended.   Other films worth tracking down:   The Knack....and How to Get It (directed by Richard Lester) Help! (directed by Richard Lester) Red Beard (directed by Akira Kurosawa)   Also, I personally don't think Dr Zhivago is worth investing your time in, unless you see Lawrence of Arabia and like the massive scope of a Lean picture. Me, I can live without it."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,imephraim,5,Sat Jul 4 04:36:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for these great suggestions. I feel like Godard is definitely a bit hit-and-miss, but his constant 'rule breaking' and strong visuals always draws me to his films out of curiosity. Agnes Varda is always popping up on here and other websites. Hopefully I'll get around to seeing some her films soon. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are both excellent, so I can imagine they would be a lot of fun together. I'm sure one of my Beatles super-fan friends will have some Lester films I can borrow. Kurosawa and Mifune are one of  best director-actor combos ever. I'll watch anything they do. And yeh, you can't go wrong with a good sport documentary."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,allhewhoknows,2,Sat Jul 4 05:16:01 2015 UTC,Why do you dislike Godard so much? He's probably my favorite director of all time. There are few directors who combined challenging form with breathtaking cinematography and political philosophy as well or as often as him.
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,allhewhoknows,3,Sat Jul 4 06:22:05 2015 UTC,"I talk about it in another comment-thread on here. I'll link that for you.  I don't like Godard because I find his sense of humor unfunny and I think his films are rarely more than flashy showcases of how knowledgeable he is about film. Other New Wave directors use this cinephilia, too, while making memorable stories that have rich resonance and depth (i.e., Chabrol's Hitchcockian thrillers, Truffaut's character-studies, Demy's musical-sendups). Godard's films, on the other hand, are riddled with flat characters, flat images, and an overall frigid camera technique that comes off as hollow, in my eyes. His characters speak in very non-human, boring terms: they rattle off quotes and Godard thinks that by name-checking as many directors, philosophers, writers, etc. as possible, you'll somehow get the meaning of the film from those quotes. But you don't. The quotes are rarely supported by Godard's imagery. You get the feeling of constructedness in a Godard which I hate; I like to be immersed in film worlds and not be reminded of the camera unless it's absolutely imperative. But Godard thumbs his nose at the audience, demanding you notice why he did a particular trick or why he decided to film a scene in one shot.  I get the overwhelming sense of snarky cynicism and nihilist hatred of humanity in a Godard film. He thinks we're all people in a vast, endless film, and so films his subjects accordingly. Why subject ourselves to that sort of cynical pop-garbage if you don't offer us some silver lining (as in the films of Pasolini), or even, at the very least, some riveting character establishment (as in the films of Kubrick)? Does he hate his audiences? Does he push them to the point that they won't care? Who knows. I just know his movies are not for me.  He's the only really controversial opinion I have of anybody, though. I generally like a lot of movies/directors.  Now Agnes Varda; there's a director whose form is both rigorous and challenging, especially in Le Bonheur."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,montypython22,2,Sat Jul 4 06:50:35 2015 UTC,"Chimes At Midnight! Criterion is working on a good quality copy, but this 480p version kept me entertained. It's one of Welles's masterpieces IMO."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,whoisduley,7,Sat Jul 4 17:26:01 2015 UTC,"Does 2015 count, even though it's not finished yet?  Mad Max: Fury Road is the only film that almost got me through the theater doors. Actually, I wouldn't have seen a movie from 2014 if I hadn't been dragged to see The Giver. I've seen a bunch from 2013, but I watched them all this year. It takes me a while to catch up!  If 2015 doesn't count, my answer is both impressive and embarrassing... 1922. I haven't seen Nosferatu, Haxan, or Nanook of the North. >_<"

TrueFilm,3c1ejy,E-Step,6,Sat Jul 4 06:18:36 2015 UTC,I feel sad reading this. One of the primary discussions I have with filmmakers is about just how risky it is to make the kinds of films they used to make.  It seems especially risky now that the kind of person who enjoys them won't show up at the theater.

TrueFilm,3c1ejy,montypython22,2,Sat Jul 4 14:13:10 2015 UTC,"1936 because I still haven't seen Modern Times.  There were a couple of years where I've only seen some weird movies and not the classics from that year, so I need to fix that sometime."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,ChipSkylarkDoesntFap,2,Sat Jul 4 15:51:02 2015 UTC,My Man Godfrey (1936) is a pretty good screwball comedy.
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,race_kerfuffle,2,Sat Jul 4 01:37:29 2015 UTC,"1917 is the most recent year that I can find, and honestly there's almost nothing from it that I'm interested in seeing, but Chaplin's 'The Immigrant' looks like it could be fun and 'A Man There Was' would be nice to see, also. I quite liked Sjöström's 'Phantom Carriage.' Overall, though, it seems like an era when not much was happening or at least not much happened that we still remember. Anyone have any insight into these movies or are there any other big ones that aren't on my radar. I'm looking on the RateYourMusic chart for that year, and it doesn't look promising. Chaplin's 'Easy Street,' also from 1917, is playing on Mubi right now, so I suppose I could watch it just to cross this year off the list."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,MissLiesl,3,Sat Jul 4 02:32:19 2015 UTC,"There are some early Buster Keaton pictures from 1917 which are interesting enough considering you can see how quickly his character developed over the course of only a handful of movies.   Wild and Wooly is an exceptionally good silent western when you take into account the large number of cheap ones that would be made during that decade and the next.   Lastly, Thaïs stands out in foreign cinema because it almost looks like a German film when it's actually Italian. If you have any interest in the Futurist movement or how the German Expressionists got their ideas, you can look here."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,ginningmosquitoes,2,Sat Jul 4 08:02:35 2015 UTC,"For me it's 1939.  I watched The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance about a month ago, and it compelled to check out John Ford's other films. Stagecoach will probably be the next one I see."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,vendilion,3,Sat Jul 4 09:06:52 2015 UTC,1939 is one of the best years for film ever. It might still be the most recent truly miraculous single year.

Other than Brief Encounter I'm barely even familiar with the titles from that year.   To be honest, I was surprised I made it back that far. I tend to stick to more modern things other than the big classics. Around the 60's I started only having seen a few per year, but there was always at least one."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,Kradiant,2,Sat Jul 4 20:50:11 2015 UTC,"Fritz Lang's Scarlet Street is a decent, noir-ish drama/thriller, about an introverted artist (Edward G Robinson) who gets sucked into events that eventual spiral out of his control.  I'd previously only known Robinson for Double Indemnity, Key Largo, and his often-parodied gangster persona, so this casting against type was a revelation.  It's 'only' a comedy, but come Christmas time Christmas in Connecticut makes for lightweight, in the holiday mood entertainment."
TrueFilm,3c1ejy,imephraim,2,Sat Jul 4 12:54:59 2015 UTC,"Robinson was really versatile. His final performance in Soylent Green is incredible. I loved Scarlet Street, too."

If you're a musical fan in any capacity you'll love it. But even if you're not, it is a wonderful film regarldess: if not for the intense leading performance of Liza Minnelli as Sally Bowles (a 30s German cabaret singer during the years of the Weimer Republic--before the Nazis took over), then for the club sequences featuring Joel Grey as the insane and rebellious Emcee of the Kit Kat Klub, where Sally Bowles works. Great performances, great music, and this hazy, silky cinematography that won it the 1972 Oscar for Best Cinematography (over Gordon Willis's work for The Godfather, no less!!!)."

La battaglia di Algeri falls in and out of critical acclaim and critical denunciation because of how it handles the guerrilla warfare with (or for some critics, without) brutal honesty.  Blow Up is an Antonioni picture first of all and one of the most surreal things you'll see in the 60s. It almost didn't get widely screened in the United States because the MPAA shit canned it due to the inclusion of male nudity and a loose handling of sexuality. It's a damn strange film to watch, especially the mind-scratching ending.   Dai-bosatsu tôge, or The Sword of Doom, is cold, intense, and the ending feels like it strangles you. It's one of the greatest samurai films out there."

Examples: the pram scene in Untouchables, where the absurdity is pushed to the point where it's almost comic; Mission Impossible's heist scene, where the stakes get raised and raised way beyond the norm; the entirety of Carrie.   Not to mention other stylistic touches that define him e.g. the use of split-diopter lenses, where alternating foreground and background objects remain in focus at the same time, the use of femme-fatales and other Hitchcockian concepts e.g. men on the run (Blow Out, Mission Impossible), slow motion and split screen."

I'd suggest checking out Sisters, The Phantom of the Paradise, Carrie, Dressed to Kill, and Blow-Out if you really want to get a sense of it.  Essentially he's all about the thriller. Carries (npi) on from Hitchcock but in a more B-movie fashion, flirting with giallo and slasher influences, as well as camp and exploitation. He's not going to be a polished as Hitchcock though, so don't expect Dressed to Kill to have the same restraint as Psycho (though it's clearly influenced by it). And don't expect a film like Scarface to be as subtle as The Godfather, even though they're often awkwardly lumped together.   He's a really fascinating director though and a huge film geek, doing the reference thing before Tarantino (most famously in The Untouchables referencing the famous stroller-down-the-stairs scene from Battleship Potemkin)."

TrueFilm,3bw3ff,mythicalsage,23,Thu Jul 2 17:04:02 2015 UTC,"Nice vid! Personally, I'd have loved to see some speculation about the future of gay representation in film. Like Blue is the Warmest Colour getting a lot of praise for finally addressing the underepresentation of lesbians compared to gay men (and very rarely bisexuality - Rocky Horror is the only example I can think of a bisexual on film atm), and the rise of crowdfunding/ low budget filming meaning there's more scope for female-gaze centred films or films that explore identity in different ways. (Shank was a really novel example of homosexuality portrayed in film done on a small budget).  But there is some misinformation in this.  ""The Gay Brothers"" wasn't the first instance of homosexuality on film:   In his book The Celluloid Closet (1981), film historian Vito Russo discusses the film, claiming, without attribution, that it was titled The Gay Brothers. Russo's unsupported naming of the film has been adopted widely online and in at least three books, and his assertions that the film's content is homosexual are frequently echoed. In addition to there being no evidence for the title Russo gives the film, in fact the word ""gay"" was not generally used as a synonym for ""homosexual"" at the time the film was made. There is also no evidence that Dickson intended to present the men—presumably employees of the Edison studio—as a romantic couple. Given the lyrics of the song Dickson plays, which describes life at sea without women, it is more plausible that he intended a joke about the virtually all-male environment of the Black Maria. It was also quite common in the 19th century for men to dance with men without homosexual overtones being perceived; all-male ""stag dances,"" for instance, were a standard part of life in the 19th century U.S. Army and were even part of the curriculum at West Point.    Wiki  Furthermore, here's a big list showing the sort of same-sex affection that was commonplace during the 1800s. Calling the dancers gay might be akin to someone calling two men from the 2000s gay because they say that they ""love their bro"" when time has moved on.   Ditto with Wings -    [It was] really not a romantic kiss, reverberating more with the desperate love between two dear friends who are about to be separated by death.   Those are the two that stood out to me as dubious; I don't know much about any of the other things said. But it was still interesting! A fuller picture may have included the back-and-forth between how the actors could portray themselves compared to how they could be in real life. E.g. Monty Clift was the method actor precursor to Brando, and he almost lost his career due to a same sex exploit. It's been speculated that the reason why he turned to alcoholism (hence the accident, and so forth) was due to his sexuality. Compare to Marlene Dietrich, who spent her pre-Hollywood years on the gay scene in 20s Berlin, who stood in staunch defiance to those gender roles and who declined Hitler's invite to come back to Germany as the Arian babe she was. Then you've got folk like Jimmy Dean who responded with ""so what?"" when some friends called his housemate queer. Add in the whole Sal Mineo (from Rebel Without A Cause) being murdered irl in the 70s for homosexuality, throw in Cher's best actress nomination for portraying a lesbian (and then initially feeling pretty bummed out about having a lesbian daughter iirc) and Charlton Heston and his views - the whole picture begins to become more broad. The fame granted to those celebrities has been one of the biggest factors in what leads us to more acceptance. People want to listen to Liz Taylor more than Byron White.  It's kind of like how Hollywood was founded by jews, immigrants and women: they wanted to create, and this was the medium they could do it in - a lot of actors ended up there because it was an accepting environment (despite their performance limitations) - there's a beating heart to that history and the movies made are just kind of the face of what we see... but I'm waffling on. I just remembered Benedict Cumberbatch's sexuality being glossed over as the biggest gay icon Britain's ever had (in my opinion) (and the whole conundrum of how far Hollywood actually has to go compared to how far it's come), and it's becoming apparent to me that I have lots of thoughts and a real lack of coherency. It was a really interesting video - it's coherent, and despite a few shortcomings, it gives a good representation of what it set out to do, and has definitely given me a desire to watch/ re-watch many of those movies. Props for having Dietrich in there - she's probably the first major gay movie icon - Ellen Page wouldn't be wearing a suit if Marlene didn't first, and the Babylonian dance scene is always a favourite."

I am aware that the actual name for ""The Gay Brothers"" is ""The Dickson Experimental Sound Film."" I used the title ""The Gay Brothers"" because that is what it has generally become known as since then and I don't think its importance is diminished any by calling it one or the other. From a film essay perspective, I also felt that using the big long name would be distracting considering I only used a short clip of it. But perhaps I should include an annotation about its original name.   As to your points about the analysis of the short, whether or not the creators intended to show a romantic coupling is less relevant, I think, than the fact that it showed how there wasn't a stigma around male touching at the time, as you have stated. This kind of interaction would be almost impossible to do during the Production Code era. And that's really my whole point in the video: that there were periods of regression in American film battling against progressive movements. But once again, thank you for your thoughts!"

The 1895 Edison experimental sound film depicting two men dancing, as a third plays violin, is not entitled ""The gay brothers"". This title was erroneously given by author, Vito Russo, in his 1981 book The Celluloid Closet. With no evidence or attribution to support his claim, Russo took it upon himself to rewrite cinematic history to fit his own agenda.    I think it's important that in our effort to expose the hypocrisies of our past that we do not distort history by imposing modern cultural meaning where it doesn't apply. There is plenty of evidence to support the argument that homosexuality has always been a natural part of human behavior without having to distort history.   Otherwise, great piece!  EDIT: Someone beat me to the punch. So I'll try to distinguish my comment by saying that the issue I take with including this clip in your piece is that it detracts from your greater point about homophobia in film. The only sexual meaning in the Edison piece comes from our own erroneous modern-day perspective of it. And this isn't an issue of sexuality so much as it is an issue of epistemology."

TrueFilm,3bwu91,montypython22,13,Thu Jul 2 20:23:38 2015 UTC,"I've always thought Brian De Palma's Scarface was one of the more interesting remakes because of the way it spits in the face of the original. Hawks' film was so condemning of gangster culture - obviously with that title and the title card, but also with the death of Tony. He's unglamorously gunned down in the street as he flees from the police. De Palma's Montana however, is given the ultimate bad-ass send off; taking on a whole team of assassins in a coke-fueled shoot out. He's become a hero to some; a fetishized symbol of testosterone; with framed pictures hanging on the wall of man-caves. It seems like the complete opposite of what Hawks' initially intended."
TrueFilm,3bwu91,theBelatedLobster,5,Fri Jul 3 06:32:55 2015 UTC,"After seeing Scarface I really wished that there had been more implicit criticism of the protagonist and his self-destructive spiral in the film. Michael Corleone in The Godfather is a guy who bears the lion's share of the blame for how he and the ones he care for end up due to his choices, but the film seems to recognize that and implement it thematically.  Scarface, on the other hand, seems to share the same voice as Tony Montana himself—there's no subtextual voice of reason there to counterpoint Montana's idiocy, paranoia, and thundering machismo. Maybe I'm missing something but Scarface feels like an artifact of the excess culture it depicts, rather than a reflection or commentary on it.  I just keep thinking that there's almost a point to be made in the film, but it can't bother itself to be thoughtful or reflective enough to make any of them:   What happens when you put a chest-thumping idiot in charge because you conflate impulsive violence with decisiveness and strength? (Reminds me of the game Portal 2 in a way, which deconstructed the idea of what might happen when you give a blustering comic sidekick real power.) When somebody's paranoia and ego destroys every relationship and partnership he has, what can he expect when he's on the top but to then turn on himself? When you can't do anything but hunger for more, how do you deal with things when you finally have everything you ever wanted? Create new enemies because you need them and just pile a mountain of blow on your desk because it's the symbol of your success?"
TrueFilm,3bwu91,Clumpy,3,Fri Jul 3 18:37:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're wrong. I also don't think De Palma and your interpretation are on different playing fields. The reason I love the De Palma Scarface so much is precisely because it always throws Montana's line of work into question at all times. Through excessive imagery, we come closer to realizing a truth about this gangster world: that it is filled with play-actors who are merely skating by with good luck and trumped-up egos. As Tony says, ""the only two things I have in this world are my word and my balls""; indeed, in this business, that's ALL you need to survive and get to the top. I think De Palma finds it a foolish race, and we're meant to take Montana's paranoia in a ridiculous light. Why else would he end the movie with Tony's futile shootout in his vista, so destroyed by his own idiotic hubris? As evidenced by his evisceration by the Schwarzenegger-like silent hitman, we see that, no matter how ""big your balls"" may be in this world, there's always going to be a person more powerful than you. You'll always have enemies, you'll always fear those enemies, you'll get paranoid as a result, you start doing stupid shit as seen in Montana's dramatic fall: it's all a cycle that repeats."
TrueFilm,3bwu91,Clumpy,2,Fri Jul 3 21:44:24 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I saw all of that as mostly subtextual and things I desperately wish had been alluded to in the movie, but fair enough. Maybe I'm being a little put off by the hordes of people taking Scarface as a power fantasy or a story of a guy being betrayed and brought down by those around him, but obviously De Palma and Co. can't help that."
TrueFilm,3bwu91,ajvenigalla,2,Fri Jul 3 21:51:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a classic instance of people have a different reading of the film from the director. Sirk's Imitation of Life was laughed off by his contemporaries as soap-opera trash. Mike Nichols's The Graduate was hailed as a rallying-point and a battle-cry by the 60s counterculture. When one immerses oneself into film, however, you get to know the cliches and the stereotypes directors play with better, and you see how certain directors (I would certainly argue De Palma is one of them) use them in attempts to dismantle/subvert those cliches. It's just that audiences, most of the time, never pick up on these subversions until the film has aged a bit more. Now we see Imitation of Life as a masterpiece of racial and melodramatic honesty, and now we see The Graduate as devious and hilarious in its subtle condemnation of the youth. I think the same thing's happening to the De Palma Scarface now.  A great question to consider is to what extent De Palma was successful in conveying what he wanted. Obviously, my interpretation wouldn't hold a candle in the face of popular opinion, which glorifies and exalts the character of Tony Montana as a gangster badass. He's become a quintissential icon in hip-hop culture, and lots of people pride themselves on climbing up the ladder of success in the manner of Pacino's Montana."
TrueFilm,3bwu91,theBelatedLobster,2,Fri Jul 3 22:00:34 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, however, that these scenes where Hawks is ""moralizing"" about the gangster's demise are actually NOT Hawks. He and producer Howard Hughes were forced to insert those scenes in the film because the censors wanted the public to understand that this life isn't a glamorous one. The censors got their way for the most part, including the title (which was the censors's idea) and the final scene (the original script for Scarface: The Shame of a Nation has Tony being gunned down in a blaze of police gunfire, clicking his empty gun until he breathes his last breath--not dissimilar to the De Palma ending).  However, Hawks the director definitely is not as prudish as the censors who made him insert insipid scenes like the Townspeople's meeting. He observes scenes of brutal violence with an unmatched, lean panache. In some ways, actually, one can see these films as:   Scarface: The Shame of a Nation: a movie that APPEARS to profess a viewpoint of anti-gangsterism and anti-crime, but which, beneath the surface, actually gleefully delights in the violence it displays. Scarface: a movie that APPEARS to profess a viewpoint glorifiying the criminal exploits of his hero, but which, beneath the surface, actually violently condemns not only its hero Montana, but also the world into which he's pulled towards.   Of course, the internal logic of both Scarfaces demands that the criminal anti-hero succumb a violent, if slightly glamorous, deaths. But it's the WAY that they get to that point that makes them so fascinating.  The Hawks original is more focused on what this life of crime does to the individual, the De Palma remake is more focused on how society figures into how a person decides to take up a life of crime."
TrueFilm,3bwd40,dreamingallday,31,Thu Jul 2 18:17:04 2015 UTC,"As far as how to construct a film, I personally really enjoy this quote attributed to Stanley Kubrick:  ""A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later.""   Although I haven't ever made a film, I have written some music, and so this way of thinking about art makes sense to me. I agree with Kubrick that a good film (or song) really is the progression of moods and feelings telling the story, rather than meaning and plot telling it. A simple change in a facial expression, lighting or music, can completely change the feeling that a line of dialogue or an action conveys to the audience, and that slight change in feeling can be more effective for me than even the best written plot exposition.  For instance, Raging Bull, at its surface is a fairly simple story, great boxer in his prime, growing tension in his home life and relationships, rival in the ring, rival in his family, gradual destructive fall from grace. The basic plot of the film would probably not make a particularly compelling story, unless it was executed perfectly. But when you add in the 'progression of moods and feelings' that Robert De Niro (playing Jake La Motta), the other characters, and by extension, the audience all have to go through, that is what makes the film stand out. There doesn't need to be tons of intrigue or twists in the plot itself, and there doesn't have to be a single take home moral, the intrigue is in the progression of feelings the audience goes through. In particular the tension and changing emotions within the family tell a story which is more compelling than ""He fought one guy, then he fought another guy, fighting is tough on people, Dramatic climax, Hammer home the moral of the story, 'The End'."" Which is the type of story I feel like I've seen way too much of lately.  I guess I would assume that to write a film this way you would start by asking yourself something like the following: ""How do I want my audience to feel walking out of this? Happy, Sad, Horrified, Devastated? What progression of emotions can I take them through to achieve that? And how does that relate the specific events of the story I want to tell?"" Along with the emotions you want the audience to feel, I think fairly early on you would have to decide on a basic theme or message you wanted to get across. I think the plot details would almost come last in the writing process if you agree with Kubrick's quote.  Anyways, I will admit that I don't know if this is actually a realistic way to write a screenplay, but since reading that Kubrick quote, I have begun to see it as a compelling way to approach my own music, and it was also a bit different than the two ideas you mentioned."
TrueFilm,3bwd40,jam66539,5,Thu Jul 2 21:17:02 2015 UTC,"That Kubrick quote really hit the nail on the head. I disagree with people who say that Kubrick was a ""cold"" filmmaker. He clearly had an excellent understanding of human emotions, especially when compared to other so-called ""cold"" filmmakers like Scott, Fincher, and Nolan."
TrueFilm,3bwd40,Zeego123,3,Fri Jul 3 16:22:48 2015 UTC,"Good post, I agree completely with the above in that the film should focus more on the experience.  Most people remember Whiplash for the experience. Sure there's a plot (guy wants to be the very best, he works hard, he succeeds) and sure there's a theme (should I give everything up to be the best?), but it's the experience that people remember (The struggle, the screaming, the break-up, the shedding of blood, the car crash, and the eventual triumph)."
TrueFilm,3bwd40,monkeyd_ace,3,Fri Jul 3 04:33:47 2015 UTC,"But Raging Bull's mood is only relevant within the context of the plot. Two people punching each other until one gives up is a narrative. Unlike music, which only has mathematical relationships between tones and rhythms, movies have music AND imagery AND structure. And very few films would try to get away with the abstraction of swirling colors and dots a painting can.  Movies speak not just in moods but symbolism as well, which opens up a lot more than Kubrick in that quote is giving his work credit. Hell, look at the end of Paths of Glory (1957). Arguing that Kubrick is simply establishing a disembodied feeling of melancholy ignores so much about what makes those final moments so relevant -- the plot.  For all of Kubrick's skill with mood and subtext, he always works from a plot, he often is attached to films with expository voiceover, and sometimes he straight-up spells out what he's trying to say."
TrueFilm,3bwd40,BZenMojo,2,Fri Jul 3 15:39:03 2015 UTC,"I think I'll address a few points you made below, before you read this, be aware I am not trying to be combative at all, I just disagree with a few of your points and I want to discuss them a bit more.   But Raging Bull's mood is only relevant within the context of the plot. Two people punching each other until one gives up is a narrative. Unlike music, which only has mathematical relationships between tones and rhythms, movies have music AND imagery AND structure. And very few films would try to get away with the abstraction of swirling colors and dots a painting can.   Interesting perspective, and I do agree that Raging Bull needs some form of a plot written to get its moods across, and the violence/boxing narrative does work well to tell the emotional story of the family's undoing, but I still think focusing on the 'moods and feelings' more than the plot, lends itself to better film making than 'plot first, moods and theme later'.   I think my perspective on this comes from my perception that mood, feelings etc. are more important to my viewing experience than plot points and narrative. I don't tend to care that much whether or not the story makes sense literally, I care that it makes me feel something that I didn't feel 10 minutes before being immersed in it.  As well, I think the 'progression of moods and feelings' that Kubrick references, still works without a defined plot in those few cases of abstraction you mentioned, but films that only present plot points without intending any mood or emotion changes become a checklist to get the viewer to the end of the film.  Overall, I think the Kubrick quote is just trying to stress the importance of having the mood at the heart of the creative process over all else. I don't think he is in any way saying that the theme or plot of a film is meaningless, just that it should come later in the process, once you have already established the music-like composition of the moods and feelings."

No, that's a perfectly valid perspective. I think Kubrick in that quote may have expressed a sort of ""granted"" fallacy, in which he's obviously showing you a plot, he can't help or escape it and it was there in the script before he picked it up, but he's focused on what he can give in addition to what was already there."
TrueFilm,3bwd40,BZenMojo,4,Sat Jul 4 15:06:45 2015 UTC,"Second to what the previous two posters said. Also, if you start with a meaning and you want to build a movie around it, you have to first articulate that meaning or theme, which means you're using the story to communicate something you've already put into words or at least sketched out using a rational train of thought, which in turn means you're reducing your movie to something that could have been summarized in an expository essay. I find myself drawn to movies with pleasures and meanings that I can't articulate, for reasons I can't pin down. I think Schrader said once that he starts with a metaphor or theme, but most great filmmakers I've heard speak on the subject have expressed mystification as to what leads them down certain narrative paths, because they themselves are finding the meanings of their films as they go. Plot and meaning, in this sort of process, might be inseparable."

Ultimately, I think looking for the source of a story is very problematic. Who knows what inspires people to write a great piece of music, or film, or what-have-you. I think people basically create these things, because they feel compelled to. By what, or why, doesn't really matter, I don't think it can really be explained.  In short, I don't think meaning, or plot, or any other element comes first or last. I think a screenwriter or director writes something, and just by nature of the way the human mind works, thematic elements, meanings, etc. will be in there, and be found by people who view it."

When you try and make a movie with nothing but subtext, you fail at engaging the viewer (eg, Jurassic World); when you make a movie with no subtext whatsoever, you likewise fail (eg, all the Asylum films).  The best movies are ones that both support a totally facile understanding (Starship Troopers as a rah-rah, military-wins-the-day movie) and as a subtextual critique of that very message. (Starship Troopers as a send-up of fascism)  Whiplash, for example, is both a totally engrossing tale of the lengths people will go to achieve greatness and what they will pay to get it and contains the symbolism that people are willing to impart onto it.  Note that ""symbolism"" is a pretty meaningless term; the Death of the Author Sisek has written extensively on means that you can impart pretty much any symbolism onto any film, if you can back it up (Transformers: Dark of the Moon being a repudiation of the patriarchy via Megatron - and all his yonic symbolism - being defeated by mechanical embodiment of male power fantasy in Optimus). It isn't always something put there by the director, and indeed in many cases it is up to the viewer to interpret and read what symbolism through the lens of their own experience.

Transformers 4 also had this issue; sure, being written by someone with a sense of humor was an upgrade, but declaring movies dead along the way is an invitation to be as crass as the material onscreen.

The tree rings in Vertigo. The green light in The Great Gatsby. The girl in red in Schindler's List. ""Boy With Apple"" in The Grand Budapest Hotel. ""Irma Vep"" in Irma Vep. Batman. Superman.   Sure, many things can be symbolic. Colors. Weather. Scenery. But you may be casting too wide a net here.  EDIT: Thought I'd add an example of how subtext isn't symbolism. Top Gun is famous for scenes, such as the volleyball game, that have a homoerotic subtext. But that doesn't make the game a symbol for homoeroticism. And couple dances in film musicals aren't symbols of copulation. The subtext is there. But that's more of a genre convention than specific symbolism."

TrueFilm,3bs6qg,strangenchanted,8,Thu Jul 2 15:25:42 2015 UTC,"There are some differences in the two concepts. I'd say that subtext is generally hidden, while symbols are overt. Subtext rewards observant and analytical viewers with expanded context. Symbols are shortcuts for conveying weighty ideas without burdening the film with explanations.  It helps to think of visual arts here. A painting's subtext may have something to tell us about the artist's life. One would not pick up on it without prior knowledge of the artist's background. A painting's symbols would be clearly visible on the canvas -- a cross, an angel, memento mori. They can be deciphered by almost anyone, not just people with esoteric background knowledge."

There is a line where a viewer is simply projecting something completely undefended on the piece. A person who says, ""star ship troopers"" is an allegory for homosexuality is reaching a fair bit. I'm not saying the meaning can only be defined by the director/writer, but the piece itself has to at least somewhat back it up. I'm not too familiar with Sisek to counter his specific argument, but the root word of symbol is a thing that is meant to mean or point to something else as determined by the agreeing parties or the collective whole of a culture. A symbol cannot simply be, ""I see a cup, and to me it means a vagina, therefore whenever a character is drinking from a cup the film is speaking about their inner sexual struggles"". no, the director/writer/film has to contextualize a possible meaning of cup beyond mere cup, and then if a person reacts to that subtext as sexuality, then great, but some direction or allowance for direction must be there first, intentional from the director or not."

The multiplicitous, ambiguous nature of language and visual media precludes objectivity. While there is no one 'the meaning' - not even if the director et al say otherwise - there are common meanings/messages picked up by many, which forms a consensus.   If a film makes you feel or react a certain way and you are able to identify those provocative elements with a coherent explanation (i.e. an argument) then you have already found what you seek. Whether anyone agrees or disagrees with your apprehension of the work is largely irrelevant.

Even though I can read middling reviews of Rian Johnson's ""The Brothers Bloom"" and understand where it may have its shortcomings, it makes me feel something very deeply that can't be logicked away.  I don't see this as solitary, because art is by and large not a communal experience. It can be viewed by a group of people, but the effect the art has is taking place inside each person individually. Art isn't so much communal as sharing our inner experiences with art is."

And it is essential that things have repetition.  Poetry and song lyrics involve a lot repetition.  The mind can not just jump from day 1 of medical school to graduation (see /r/Scrubs ).  Ideas and experience must be intertwined.  A film like Interstellar - the poetry is deliberately ""annoying"" to alert you that there is subtext and symbolism below the first viewing experience.  Often symbolic films will have an out of place scene that makes you think ""WTF?"" (did the director do with that scene) that alert you to subtext.  For another recent example, the film * Ex Machina* has a secondary plot about Kyoto that relates to the bloody/trippy cutting scene Caleb has in the bathroom self-examination."
TrueFilm,3bs6qg,poliphilo,10,Fri Jul 3 03:11:12 2015 UTC,"It takes time to develop the skill. When I was in high school, there usually would be a whole year where you'd learn how to find symbolic meaning, mostly in books but movies too. There's specific tools that can help: look up names of characters & places, look for double meanings of words, know the symbolic meanings of colors.  One tool that I think is under-discussed is to figure out how something makes you feel and why. If for example, Whiplash makes you feel scared for the student, you could connect that with other scary situations and see if the movie kind of works to explore both kinds of fears at the same time.  I also suggest watching Tristram Shandy... it's a comedy about people making a movie, and a good amount of the running time is funny discussion about symbolism in movies—how it matters, how it doesn't, how it can be hard to tell, or ridiculous in some ways. Funny movie in general."
TrueFilm,3bs6qg,lordhadri,18,Wed Jul 1 19:20:11 2015 UTC,"The problem with the high school version of symbolism is that it encourages the sort of art culture that feels rewarded by the most obvious symbolism possible. What I never learned, until I figured it out on my own much later, was that it's all about evoking feeling. Not looking for obviously telegraphed metaphors in the text. That's not to say we should never have that, just that it's way over-emphasized. That's why nobody really learns to write poetry or prose form formal English education even though we studied both.  Cinema is the same way. When I had an English class that focused on movies, we had to write a substantial amount about Crash."

I basically agree, though; it seems a lot of people had the same experience with English teachers pushing one particular style of metaphoric reading and insisting that was the only kind of reading that mattered. I had a couple teachers like this, but I had another (who taught the above movies, fortunately) who taught symbolism when appropriate but raised other issues too—enriching rather than reductive. Example: pointing out Maude's Holocaust tattoo, which I hadn't picked up on.  On this note, I wish the English teachers who pushed this whole symbolism orthodoxy had been clearer that subtext is actually a useful way of evading censors and commercial gatekeepers. I.e. sex in Victorian English novels, but also gay sex in Fight Club and currency manipulation in Zhang Yimou. Those teachers never made clear that censorship was an actual thing anyone worried about... or that subtext could successfully avoid detection. This factor's irrelevant to like, 90+% of the movies I see, but it's helpful at least once in a while."

Even with all this abuse he becomes great, but at the loss of friends and his own mental and physical health. What does this show? You took it that they film was promoting this kind of abuse that if you want to become great you have to deal with these problems. Others take the film differently, neither of you are wrong or right. Film is objective and each person sees a film differently than someone else. Symbolism is really how you interpret what you see on screen.

TrueFilm,3bs6qg,lespectador,4,Thu Jul 2 08:27:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you want the academic response or not, but in film studies today, the idea of ""symbolism"" proper is actually pretty frowned upon as either outdated or (more often) an unnecessary borrowing from literary studies. As /u/Vermilion stated, we tend to talk a lot more about ""specific vocabulary of films...how camera angles are used, how cuts are used, etc"". This is because there is the view (though also somewhat changing) that there is a sort of cinematic language that comes from how formal techniques of cinematography, mise-en-scene, and editing come together to express, and that we can study the effects/affects of these.   Thinkers like Žižek study what they see as the ""hidden ideology"" that can be revealed in certain film forms or tropes, and the psychoanalysts are similar, believing that there is a ""hidden truth"" below the surface that must be revealed in order to grant a deeper meaning to the object. But it's rare that you can productively attribute a 1:1 relationship of symbolism (i.e.: the color red in this film stands for XYZ) -- it's usually much more complicated than that. It's a topic with a LONG history, but for starters, you might look into how the cinema as a medium deals with questions of representation (i.e.: do films depict, like a painting? do they represent, like a language/symbol? do they indicate/point toward an outside object/reality? etc). This is how we tend to approach the question, at least in film studies."

This model of what some (Nicole Brenez for example) has called the ""analogic pact"" between image and language (i.e. the use of linguistic or grammar analogies for analyzing film) is still often used in the classroom because it provides a very accessible pedagogic model, but among film scholars there is a shift away from it because it's not considered ""medium specific"" (i.e. the view that the cinema doesn't need to rely on outside models or analogies to be legitimately studied)."

These kinds of things can be unique to the style; for example a video game or comic book film may have special techniques that borrow from their respective sources.  Or even a Japanese ""sex scene"" may have different symbolism that a Canadian ""sex scene"" would not share.  I invite you to go deeper. To me, the best teacher on the subject is Joseph Campbell. He not only discusses stories; he relates them to Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung psychology.  He connects both art and religion (there is no debate in his mind that all religion books are fiction stories, so in his view Mohammad is a more popular and influential storyteller than William Shakespeare).  He relates stories to the NASA Moon Landing, he relates stories to LSD drugs and the Native American peyote usage!  His final and relatively short book that summarizes his life's work is The Inner Reaches of Outer Space: Metaphor as Myth and as Religion.  My personal view of Joseph Campbell is identical to that of Stephan A. Hoeller.

TrueFilm,3bs6qg,sheriff_gingerbeard,20,Wed Jul 1 18:55:04 2015 UTC,"This is directed at OP, but in response to your comment to add to it.   I just want to add a slightly different perspective: don't get too wigged out when you see psychoanalytic stuff, e.g. Freud and Jung. There is a lot of symbolic reading that is done outside of psychoanalysis, but people often see that and think it's kind of the end-all-be-all of film theory.  I caution you just because I know that I personally loathe psychoanalysis. It's using mostly bygone psychological theories and is kind of a closed system, in that it is a very complicated system building on itself, but with little validity outside of that system. That's not inherently bad, but I think (this is opinion, just to emphasize) that psychoanalysis is often used to sound smart without really contributing to an understanding of the film or its context. The exception, of course, is directors who actually imbue the film with psychoanalytic qualities, as Kubrick and Hitchcock often did. Then, it's kind of essential to picking the film apart.  I'm not critiquing psychoanalysis for going after more than the filmmaker intended. I am critiquing it for, in my opinion, being a fabricatedly dense theory that does not contribute much to understanding a film (either as a stand-alone text, or a text in context) other than how it functions psychoanalytically. Feminist Theory, for one example of a contrast, gives you insight into how its characters function in a cultural, gendered context, and how that shapes the actions and decisions of each character. The directors' intention can interestingly inform how the text functions under this lens, but each film has an implicit set of values that can be unearthed by Feminist Theory with clear referents to the context of the film.  Sorry for the rant. I'm not trying to say anyone who likes psychoanalysis is wrong. I just want to let the OP see that this symbolic reading business has a lot to it, and people often get thrown off of reading film through theoretical/symbolic lenses due to obstacles like Freud and Jung."
TrueFilm,3bs6qg,Falolizer,5,Wed Jul 1 19:13:31 2015 UTC,"I agree that outside academic circles psychoanalytic theory and Joseph Campbell seem to have more or less monopolized ideas of symbolism and imagery in film.  Another thing I think adds to people's notions of symbolism is the idea that ""good"" symbolism essentially amounts to Easter Eggs like the ones so often brought up here on reddit about Fight Club or Kubrick's movies. Which isn't completely off, it's that it leads to stuff like Room 237, which presents minor continuity errors as massive clues to the Shining's ""hidden meanings"". By the way, Room 237 is also guilty of basing entire interpretations on completely discredited pseudo-psychology like subliminal messages."
TrueFilm,3bs6qg,berimbolo96,2,Wed Jul 1 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the undue influence is due to the allure of a system is that it justifies ""deep""/complex interpretations where even the most basic objects and behaviors are rich in psychosexual subtext. Hidden forces, oedipal drives and a collective unconscious all provide license for widely varying artistic criticism. Too bad its rooted in mostly outdated and unscientific psychology."
TrueFilm,3bs6qg,Vermilion,0,Wed Jul 8 00:21:06 2015 UTC,"reading film through theoretical/symbolic lenses due to obstacles like Freud and Jung.   But I emphasize deeper, all art. Meaning, simply, books and films both.  Which means you go back further in time than Freud.  Freud behaved as if fiction and psychology had no relationship.  This is where Jung differed.  Campbell, 1986 (interviewed at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch):    They are elementary ideas, what could be called ""ground"" ideas. These ideas Jung spoke of as archetypes of the unconscious. ""Archetype"" is the better term because ""elementary idea"" suggests headwork. Archetype of the unconscious means it comes from below. The difference between the Jungian archetypes of the unconscious and Freud's complexes is that the archetypes of the unconscious are manifestations of the organs of the body and their powers. Archetypes are biologically grounded, whereas the Freudian unconscious is a collection of repressed traumatic experiences from the individual's lifetime.   The Freudian unconscious is a personal unconscious, it is biographical. The Jungian archetypes of the unconscious are biological. The biographical is secondary to that.  All over the world and at different times of human history, these archetypes, or elementary ideas, have appeared in different costumes. The differences in the costumes are the results of environment and historical conditions. It is these differences that the anthropologist is most concerned to identify and compare.   Now, there is also a countertheory of diffusion to account for the similarity of myths. For instance, the art of tilling the soil goes forth from the area in which it was first developed, and along with it goes a mythology that has to do with fertilizing the earth, with planting and bringing up the food plants -- some such myth as that just described, of killing a deity, cutting it up, burying its members, and having the food plants grow. Such a myth will accompany an agricultural or planting tradition. But you won't find it in a hunting culture. So there are historical as well as psychological aspects of this problem of the similarity of myths."

Your response is kind of dense, but not because of depth, but just pure complexity. It's what I imagine is a basic argument with basic concepts, drenched in opaque terminology and sentence structure, to make a point that seems at best circuitously related to what I was saying. It's exactly what I criticize about psychoanalysis.  But I think you're saying that Freud's work is not a closed system as I claimed because it relates to everyone in terms of how they think of themselves. Jung taps into archetypes across cultures. Which, maybe, but the problem with them or psychoanalysis in general isn't that everything they've ever said is wrong, but that it's represented in just incorrect ways. The unconscious mind is not much thought of in psychology besides in teaching psychoanalysis as part of psychology's history. I'm not as keen on Jung, but usually the way he presents the archetypes seems routed in similar psychological mumbo jumbo that's long been dismissed.  Please let me know if I've misinterpreted what you're saying."
TrueFilm,3bs6qg,sheriff_gingerbeard,6,Thu Jul 2 02:25:54 2015 UTC,"I love Campbell and I think its for the same reason I loved Story of Film, as well as Zizek and even that Transformers example mentioned below. It's someone explicitly explaining the symbolism or adding meaning to a story that I wouldn't have otherwise picked up.   At the same time, I love Kubrick and Lynch even when I have no idea what is going on but I am consumed by some unexplainable feeling. I think It's the 90% of movies in between those extremes where I get confused because the film is sort of ambiguous where I think, ""is this actually happening or should I being reading into it more?"""
TrueFilm,3bs6qg,Vermilion,6,Wed Jul 1 19:25:26 2015 UTC,"Well, Lynch is an interesting thing. A lot of people would argue that the more you try to get a Lynch movie, like Mulholland Drive, the more you're missing the point. It's a post-modernism thing, or post-structuralist, where a lot of the work is meant to resist meaning, to dissociate its images from any supposed ""meaning"" that we apply to it. Part of Mulholland Drive's power is that it's in many ways imperceptible, an exploration of anxieties and fears. A lot of Lynch's work accomplishes this. It abandons a rigid set of symbols and logic in order to explore a more visceral reaction to the subject matter.  That's not to say there aren't running themes, of course."

For me, with Lynch, that feeling is precisely deliberate!  The mystery that Lynch feels - is directly expressed in the film.  Yes, it has deeper meaning, but perhaps he doesn't know the answer yet.  He is expressing the question - and that is where symbols shine!   I love Campbell    Related to what I feel in Lynch films (and I have seen several public interviews with him):  ""The ultimate mystery of being is beyond all categories of thought. As Kant said, the thing in itself is no thing. It transcends thingness, it goes past anything that could be thought. The best things can't be told because they transcend thought.  The second best are misunderstood, because those are the thoughts that are supposed to refer to that which can't be thought about. The third best are what we talk about. And myth is that field of reference to what is absolutely transcendent."""

TrueFilm,3bs6qg,kuinerb,6,Thu Jul 2 06:22:48 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I think a lot of people would strongly disagree with your girlfriend's interpretation.   There really are abusive people like that in life, and some teachers who think you can make your students achieve greatness by treating them that way. The film examines what you have to put up with or sacrifice to achieve greatness, through a specific guy's story. Not much symbolism at all.   My favourite motif or symbol recently is in the first Captain America movie: twice, before he gets his superhero shield, Steve Rogers picks up objects which represent a shield. He picks up the lid of a garbage can in the fight in the alley, and he picks up a taxi door, with a star design on it, shortly after his transformation. Just a nice little visual pun or hint that he was following his destiny all along? It doesn't have to be incredibly deep and meaningful."
TrueFilm,3bs6qg,ryudas,3,Wed Jul 1 21:26:23 2015 UTC,"I haven’t seen Whiplash so I can’t comment on who is right, but I would adjust your understanding of your girlfriend’s statement from “the protagonist is really just a symbol of life’s struggles,” to something like “the protagonist’s dilemma spoke to her experience of the struggles of life.” A movie can be unrealistic, in the sense that maybe there are no teachers who are that extreme, but still speak to real-world emotions and concerns. In fact, movies often exaggerate the elements that they want to emphasize in order to really make the dilemma clear and meaningful. For example, if the price the protagonist had to pay for greatness was just dealing with a teacher who is a little overbearing then the dilemma would have no emotional force. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean you are wrong to feel the teacher is too unrealistic. Maybe in the attempt to add drama they made the movie too one-sided and didactic, or maybe the movie presents a position on the central dilemma that you simply find too unpalatable. Either way, you both could have a valid point.  It’s best not to get too caught up in hunting for symbols and secret meanings and just try to follow the emotional flow of the movie. A movie is an experience, not a code to be deciphered. Sometimes movie use clear symbolism, but it tends to be obvious when they’re doing that (e.g. Intellectual montage or cinematic allusions). Other times when people are talking about what a shot “means” they just mean something like “what connotations does this shot have?”  In the process of watching the movie, an image or scenario may bring to mind different associations (call them symbols if you want, but I think that makes them seem far too grand and mysterious). This may lead you to wonder, “Do these associations actually have anything to do with the movie or are they completely idiosyncratic?” I think the best way to approach this question isn’t to ask, ""is this what the filmmaker intended?” but instead to instead ask, “does this association or metaphor take me away from the movie or does it allow me to better see and appreciate what is actually there on the screen?” The clichéd example of taking you away from the movie would be a stereotypical psychoanalytic interpretation, which transforms everything into an oedipal struggle. The particulars or the movie don’t illuminate the concepts in the theory and the theory doesn’t allow you to notice new things about the movie qua movie (note: I’m not making any claims either way about the validity of actual psychoanalytic film criticism).  Learning to develop these kinds of associations isn’t that different from connecting to people emotionally in real life. When someone tells you a story about a problem they had you use your own personal experiences, knowledge of the world, and imagination to relate on an emotional level. The novelist John Gardner wrote “theme is elevated critical language for what the character's main problem is.” While I think it’s a little more complicated than that, I think a great first step is to just identify what the protagonist’s problem is and then see how that problem speaks to your own experience and what associations that brings to mind. In the case of Whiplash, you might think about (or imagine) a time you felt pressured to make a great personal sacrifice in order achieve what may or may not be a greater end.  This will provide some emotional context to allow you to better engage with the story.  With these associations in mind, pay attentions to how the movie presents the character’s experiences. Maybe you’ll recognize certain thoughts and feelings they’re having. Maybe their experience will shed new light on your own life or understanding of the world. Maybe they’ll have a response that’s totally alien to you but you can still come to understand and empathize with their position even if you don’t share it. Or maybe your experiences will highlight the ways the movie get these emotions or experiences wrong.  Sometimes you will find yourself unable to make that connection and that’s OK. Sometimes reading some critical writing will help. Sometimes familiarizing yourself with the director’s other movies or movies in a similar style will help. And sometimes you’re just not on the same wave-length as the director. But most of the time you should be able to get a sense of what they’re doing even if you fundamentally disagree with their sensibility and world-view. (This won’t always be the case: some art films, for example, will deliberately frustrate understanding or emotional engagement in order to achieve different ends, but they tend to be the exceptions so don’t worry about that right now.) Hopefully this helps demystifies “symbolism” for you and allows you engage with movies (or art in general) in a more confident way."
TrueFilm,3bs6qg,Vermilion,3,Thu Jul 2 05:12:52 2015 UTC,"For me, the types of movies with symbolism that do it for me, are movies like Children of Men. Subtle, surreptitious, and wove into the movie. It's not blatant, and it's not ""in your face"". The symbolism and the backgrounds tell many stories, and you can miss it entirely. And yet you can watch the whole movie and never notice these details, these tiny stories woven into the main plot. These kinds of movies make the re-watching experience thoroughly enjoyable.You can always find something more, something that gives you extra insight into the world this story happens. that's the kind of symbolism I like."

I wish to add: Reading a massive number of movie reviews by individuals - I often find people think that symbolism requires that there be no direct story.  In particular, people cite the film 2001: A Space Odyssey as full of ""pure"" symbolism because it has so little direct explanation (verbal/text).  I suggest this is a mistaken approach.  For example, ""The Bible"" is full of in-your-face content (rules and regulations on all kinds of things) - but it also is full of subtext and symbolism.  It's often the case that both exists.  It's a function of time to how much you read and re-read the poetry before the symbolism starts to appear."

You don't need to take it all on face-value; pushing people to their limit is certainly a major part of the movie, but that doesn't mean Whiplash endorses abuse. In the directors words:   [Question] Where do you think these two go after this movie ends? They had a moment at the end of the film, but I feel these two will always hate each other.  [Answer]  I think so. I think it’s definitely a fleeting thing. I think there’s a certain amount of damage that will always have been done.

People who practice because they really love their instrument live to be old like Andrew's hero Buddy Rich. Instead he will OD in his 30s like Fletcher's hero Charlie Parker.

The two men more or less validate a sort of twisted belief system about success toward each other, but the movie gives us, the audience, all kinds of reasons to believe that both of these people are all kinds of terrible. We sympathize with them because they're well written characters, but we also see both of them destroy the relationships around them to such an extent that they are basically left alone together by the end. At the very least I'd see a lot more room for interrogating ideologies of success and who gets to be recognized as such in Whiplash than your reading allows for."

TrueFilm,3bs6qg,Pomguo,2,Thu Jul 2 16:19:34 2015 UTC,"I think one great way to appreciate a film for its underlying message is to understand the movie going in. Either read about what the underlying message is before you watch it, or (if you don't like spoilers) watch the movie twice. I'll give you a personal example. I recently watched The Babadook for the first time. If you haven't seen it, the major underlying theme of that film is depression. It is exploring the main character's depression and grief over her dead husband through this literal monster (or ghost or whatever) that is terrorizing her and her son. If I hadn't gone into the movie knowing that the Babadook was going to be a symbol for this depression, I might not have picked up on it, and I certainly wouldn't have appreciated the movie as much. Sometimes it's hard to fully grasp what the filmmaker's intended message was, and it helps to go into the film with some understanding of this message."

TrueFilm,3bs6qg,rustajb,2,Thu Jul 2 03:52:54 2015 UTC,"One thing I think should be made clear is that symbolism is a matter of subtext which is distinct from the actual text of a work. If you believe for example that the abuse in Whiplash is metaphorical and/or symbolic then you are interpreting the subtext and not the text itself. So according to this interpretation the film is advocating for abuse on a surface level, but on a subtextual level is not. Another example would be Starship Troopers which on the surface seems to advocate fascism, but is actually satirizing our cultural attitudes that lead towards fascism. This subversion needs a text that on the surface aligns with the ideology it's satirizing in order for the film to subtextually skewer that ideology."
TrueFilm,3bs6qg,ducklax21,2,Thu Jul 2 02:50:41 2015 UTC,"Symbolism can definitely be overdone or done poorly and get in the way of a movie.  A good movie usually has all the things you mentioned, but it also usually employes symbolism, if appropriate, in a way that enhances the movie and those other aspects.  I think your girlfriend was reaching a little bit when she basically suggested ignoring something unrealistic in an otherwise realistic movie because it is purely symbolism."
TrueFilm,3bs6qg,doubledoverweeds,2,Thu Jul 2 14:42:18 2015 UTC,"Late to the party, just wanted to comment on the Whiplash thing.    I was distracted by how unrealistically abusive the teacher was and that the film seemed to be promoting the idea of abuse as a way of attaining greatness.   If you think back to the other characters, like 'crazy laid back other drummer dude' or 'massively overcompensating parental compliments', you get a picture. Everyone but our MC is virtually riding that line of unrealistic. This then changes the Teacher from 'abusive crazy man' into just another over the top representation of the pressure felt by the MC.   So if you happen to rewatch it sometime, picture the film as if its biased towards the view of our main character and that small issues are over blown. Its not quite as striking if the teachers 'abuse' was a condescending look, having him throw a drum set gives the needed umph of energy."

You can change, or develop how you see a movie, or movies in general, but it's always going to be somewhat unique to your own perspective and perception. Of course, many people, critics, filmmakers, actors, etc. will have overlap — familial resemblances — between how they perceive a certain film.  I don't think you should feel bad for seeing films at face value. To be honest, I think a lot of people over think films they watch, or try to dig to deeply into them, to the point where it starts to degrade the truth and/or beauty of it. Analyzing a movie isn't a bad thing. But over analyzing it to the point where everything is in view (or so they think) is degrading.  I think film is an interesting medium because it necessitates seeing above all else. The connections people will make with the images that they are seeing will always be different, because human experience is different. The great part about it, though, is that a lot of people have shared experiences, and therefore can come to similar conclusions about a movie.  I can appreciate symbology in a film, but one of my biggest gripes with film studies and analysis is that people take the importance/weight of symbology to such an extreme. A lot of people think the Cohen brothers' films are littered with deep symbology (which they are, in some regards) but often when people have asked them why they did a certain shot in a certain way (or what-have-you), they simply say ""because it looked good"".  Maybe what you can try doing is watching the same movies twice. On the first viewing don't think, just look. Take everything at face-value. Let yourself have a completely spontaneous and authentic reaction to it — emotionally, intellectually, visually. Then, after some thought, watch it again, maybe with someone who's better at seeking out symbols than you, and concentrate on the semiotics. Then, think about it some more. By the end, you should have a fairly good grasp of what the film is about, and what it's trying to say."
TrueFilm,3bs6qg,chipvd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:11:52 2015 UTC,It took me awhile to train myself to look for symbolism even longer to appreciate it.

He is wrong. He is a wasted life by his own standards, a man who has utterly failed to either become great or produce anyone great. The main character achieves some form of greatness by the end, but no more so than the previous student who ended up killing himself a few years after 'successfully' finishing the teacher's course as a prize pupil. The main character merely came to the conclusion that the abuse and self-flagellation is worth it in order to make greater art than he would otherwise be capable, as this appears to be the only route to it that is available to him.   The teacher is a monster through all of this, but the main character is one who ends up sharing the same twisted value of art at all costs."

There's a bunch of options between dystopia and reality, I don't see why it needs to be one or the other.   Complaining that the characters actions in a film like this are unbelievable seems like a really bizarre criticism. These are people completely separated from our world and even our way of processing the world (language) so they're not going to act like ""normal"" people would. Their understanding of reality is completely foreign from ours so looking for realistic actions in that is pointless. I think I just don't get looking for realism or reality in everything. With that kind of thinking painting would've stopped at portraiture and landscapes.   So no I'm not bothered by ""plot-universe-real world inconsistencies"" because films are inherently not real and it's part of the point in them to create or unveil truth through that falseness. Some films go further with their lack of reality into full on surrealism but even things striving for realism (and even documentary's) are far from the ""real world"".   With Dogtooth in particular it creates its own little universe to explore exactly what it wants to so looking at it as a representation of the real world is looking for what isn't there.   I really like the film as a strange funny look into the kind of terrifying responsibility of parents, impact of oppression, and the power of art. We see a microcosm of twisted familial dynamics and full-on despotic regime. It doesn't just present an oppressive environment but creates one through the filmmaking.   The whole obsession over realism thing in film culture really hits a nerve with me so I may've been a bit unfair. Maybe if I heard more of your specific criticisms I'd understand more so hit me with them."
TrueFilm,3buqhe,a113er,-2,Thu Jul 2 11:36:14 2015 UTC,"I""m not looking for realism in films, if anything, the opposite: I really like films that are distancing themselves from reality in order to tell a story.  In Under the Skin for example I was not bothered by the scenes about the main character consuming its victims, since it wasn't supposed to be real at all, and it was a twisted reality with a nice visual concept.  I can't really put my finger on it (again) what bothered me about Dogtooth, but something did, and it may very well be subjective. I just did not want to accept this vision without the constant need of deconstruction, while in other films, such as Under the Skin, I somehow don't want to deconstruct and complaints about scenes being ""unrealistic"" in UtS even bother me and I'm frustrated that these people have missed the point of the movie... :D  So this is a bit comical, but maybe I did not like the style of the cinematography or the direction or the acting (except for the cat killing and the guitar/dance performance scene). So maybe it's all subjective, but I was just having this urge to deconstruct this movie while watching.  In general, I love sci-fi movies, and I have no problem integrating concepts like FTL travel or dream projection devices into plots, but sometimes minor scientific inaccuracies bother me, because they have no in-universe explanation. Maybe I just nitpick too much :-)"
TrueFilm,3buqhe,a113er,5,Thu Jul 2 11:58:14 2015 UTC,"Might be that Under the Skin is more upfront about its falseness or symbolic nature through stuff like the music and the opening scene while Dogtooth goes for a more disquieting on-the-precipice-of-our-world type thing. Which I think is part of its power that it always feels like something that could or is happening (because in some places it kind of is) but is so foreign to us it's easier to accept as fantasy.   Well yeah of course a lot of it's subjective. Sounds like this just didn't gel with you which is fine, I think I just took issue with your specific critiques.   Weirdly the only kind of scientific inaccuracy/oddity that's bothered me lately is the opening scene of Dark Knight Rises when they transfer blood to disguise a body. Every CSI show has taught me they identify people with teeth, and they didn't drain him so there's just gonna be mixed blood. So it's not like I never question things like that either. But that's also not the reason I dislike DKR, more something that came up after it already disappointed me on its own terms."
TrueFilm,3buqhe,Ammaeli,8,Thu Jul 2 12:24:28 2015 UTC,"I, too, watched this recently and my impression is that it more or less works without bringing symbolism in. What about it did you find hard to believe? Maybe I had some trouble with the outsider they bring in for sexual favors, but just like for any other event in the story, it's justifiable as plausible because we can only assume things (we don't know how disturbed she is, who she is, how she came to be contacted, etc). Also, the fact that it happens in a contemporary setting makes it much more interesting, as it's more relatable.  My problem with the film is that it feels too much like a premise, with nothing truly remarkable happening with it. I think the director protected it too much, without risking its perfection by giving any background to the parents or finishing with a more conclusive ending. I sort of expected more moments like the bursts of violence with the cassette tapes, but it's still a fascinating film."

There is no way the neighbors don't notice anything and don't report the parents for child abuse.  There is no way the girl they bring in from time to time to the brother has the exact same mental state of the kids and does not realize what's going on, never tells anyone about anything about the family, etc.  Etc, etc. There are many similar things that happen in the film that suggest the real world itself is somewhat ""off"", so there is no way this would work in the ""real life"" counterpart of the film."

If this father and mother have no family or just moved away from them why would anyone visit? Some people don't get found dead in their apartments until it smells. People can be isolationists in cities let alone large expansive countrysides.   There is no way the neighbors don't notice anything and don't report the parents for child abuse.   They live on an enclosed compound seemingly in the countryside and even if that were not the case there have been so many cases of crazy people keeping children holed up in their house without neighbours knowing for years.    There is no way the girl they bring in from time to time to the brother has the exact same mental state of the kids and does not realize what's going on, never tells anyone about anything about the family, etc.   We see she's not. She is able to manipulate them and get them to do what she wants rather than just getting used specifically because she's not been brought up like them. If someone's paid enough and doesn't care enough I don't see why she would tell anyone. She doesn't know everything we know. Getting bothered about that is making a great deal of assumptions about her."

TrueFilm,3bqees,drive27,36,Wed Jul 1 08:39:24 2015 UTC,"Since this is asking for my understanding, I won't do any research, this is just my working definition, which may be batshit crazy:  A theme is an abstract concept you're addressing, or at least broaching in some way. It's not a motif, which I think is what it's often  mixed up with, or a symbol, which may be used to evoke some aspect of the theme, but is not itself a theme.   As an example, in Blade Runner, the theme wasn't ""robots"", the themes were (your choice of): identity, what it means to be human, fatherhood, mortality, and so on, and artificial lifeforms were just a way to look at those themes.  An important aspect of a theme is that it's not a thing, it's an idea, and it's usually something that's sufficiently general that everybody can get it even without specific knowledge. That's why the theme of Whiplash wasn't Jazz Drumming, it was genius, ambition, obsession, legacy, the mentor-student relationship, etc."
TrueFilm,3bqees,getElephantById,2,Wed Jul 1 14:31:34 2015 UTC,I like this one.
TrueFilm,3bqees,clivethebear,16,Wed Jul 1 15:50:14 2015 UTC,"Is there no clear definition of theme?  I've never heard that, although I suppose I could be wrong.  Theme, whenever I've heard it defined, can be considered ""the point,"" or rather, what the author (be it screenplay writer, director, etc) is trying to convey through the piece.  There can be several in a single film, but more often than not, they will be more or less condensed into one sort of thing.  I would argue that structure also has a fairly clear definition as well, though that's beside the point."
TrueFilm,3bqees,afewthoughtsonfilm,3,Wed Jul 1 09:04:07 2015 UTC,"This was my reaction as well. The only confusion I've really come across surrounding theme is whether it is the issue(s) dealt with in the piece (masculinity or whatever) or the expressed position on the issue (the toxicity of conventional masculinity), and even that seems like a quibble for students taking quizzes rather than a useful distinction in discussion--though I could be wrong on that."
TrueFilm,3bqees,btwriter,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:04:26 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you're looking for an answer, but I think a theme is just the issue itself, not necessarily the author's position on it."

I call it a quibble for students taking quizzes because I remember being quizzed on this in high school, ha. There was a big deal made about it, but I have yet to come across a circumstance where it's a useful distinction.   I do forget the proper term for the expressed position, or the ""moral"" of the story, which is now bugging me.  Appreciate your comment, though."
TrueFilm,3bqees,btwriter,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:56:15 2015 UTC,"""the point""   See, I don't know if that's universally true.  Theme can be just as much a tool as any other aspect of storytelling, not necessarily the end result.  I'd say theme is often sort of the psychological or philosophical environment a film explores, without necessarily conveying a single unambiguous ""point"".  Like a film about ""identity"" explores various characters' relation to themselves and others, or a film about ""mortality"" explores various characters' relationships with death, both as a concept and an experience.  The film doesn't have to be engineered towards the purpose of saying ""identity is derived from the outside"" or ""Death should be feared""."
TrueFilm,3bqees,VEGETABLE_FART,2,Thu Jul 2 23:29:34 2015 UTC,"Like a film about ""identity"" explores various characters' relation to themselves and others, or a film about ""mortality"" explores various character's relationships with death, both as a concept and an experience.   Yes, but those are just motifs.  A theme has to be some point of resolution, it can't just be a simple concept.  Also, I would argue that the inclusion of those motifs often does lead to some form of statement one way or the other.  I can't think of any film that discusses just mortality without having some sort of statement on the human condition and how it relates to death; by having a character face some sort of struggle with morality, the outcome of that struggle is often what we would interpret as the theme.  If you can give me an example, then maybe I could hear what you're saying."
TrueFilm,3bqees,afewthoughtsonfilm,11,Fri Jul 3 06:07:13 2015 UTC,"Here's the way I teach ""theme"" in Intro to Film classes: theme is the attitude that the film takes toward a subject.   For example: Bataan and Apocalypse Now both deal with the subject of war, however Bataan says, thematically, that ""war is just"" while Apocalypse Now says, thematically, that ""war is absurd"". Similarly, When Harry Met Sally and Annie Hall both deal with the subject of love, yet thematically, When Harry Met Sally says ""love conquers all"" while Annie Hall says ""love doesn't conquer all, and is messy and painful, but we need it anyways"". So these films may deal with the same subject, but they have very different themes.  I like this definition because it distinguishes theme from generic subjects by clarifying that themes say something about a subject (I hate when someone tells me ""this film has a theme of death"" -- that's not a fucking theme, it's just a topic! What is the film saying about death?). However, it's broad enough to include complex films that have sophisticated things to say (such as Blade Runner's complicated take on what makes us human) as well as very simplistic films that just put a positive or negative connotation on a subject (""love is good, yay!""). It's also utilitarian in that it doesn't rely on lofty philosophical digressions -- it many cases, it can be boiled down to: ""how does this film make you feel about X?"" It can accommodate lofty philosophical digressions, but to the general audience, this definition accounts for the general gut feelings you take away at the end of a movie."

TrueFilm,3bqees,YesManJr,3,Thu Jul 2 00:12:48 2015 UTC,"The theme an emotion, opinion or attitude that a creator wants to express through his work. For example, you could say that one of the themes of Fight Club is ""the American conception of masculinity is destroying our individuality"" (inaccurate and oversimplified but I'm just trying to illustrate). ""Love"", ""death"", ""war"", etc. are not themes. It would be more accurate to refer to them as topics."
TrueFilm,3bqees,ZachHaayema,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:48:13 2015 UTC,"I would say that theme is the idea or motif that affects the filmmaking process the most.  For example a guy like Federico Fellini focuses on the theme of dreams (later in his career, early work for him was more realist) and that affects how his films are made and constructed.  That differs from the story of a film.  For 8 1/2 the story is that of a director struggling creatively, but that isn't what I would call the theme of the film.  I would still argue that 8 1/2 is about dreams and the dreamlike quality of film.  Another director with a focused theme is Bernardo Bertolucci.  The theme of his films is political; nearly every creative decision in Bertolucci's films is politically charged."
TrueFilm,3bqees,kuinerb,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:32:01 2015 UTC,"To hopefully add to what has already been said, I find that it's beneficial to think of theme as something that a story explores rather than as a message or argument that the story demonstrates. I hope the following example helps to clarify what I mean.  V.F. Perkins, in ‘Must We Say What They Mean? Film Criticism and Interpretation,’ argues that while “the ‘point’ of The Wizard of Oz might be found to be explicit in its last line of dialogue, 'There’s no place like home[,]’ such a reading presents film as a mere relay for meanings and requires an imperviousness to the complexity of cinematic expression.” He goes on to argue that in order to fully do justice to the movies theme or meaning we must “balance the affirmation in the words spoken by Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) against the anxious entreaty in her tone and against other information that the film supplies:” such as    the way that her Kansas home lacked “in courage, sensitivity, hope and colour,” which sent her into a fantasy world in the first place “the way that ‘There’s no place like home’ follows another more obviously mistaken affirmation — Dorothy’s ‘I’m not gonna leave here ever, ever again’” the way “‘Be it ever so humble . . .‘ gives way to a complete and emphatic restatement of ‘Somewhere over the rainbow . . .‘”  the way there is no real-life solution to their problems with Miss Gulch  the way “she was explicitly reluctant to leave a world in which she had found not only mirrors to the confusions and malign authority of home but also experiences of joy and companionship unique to Oz,” etc.    He concludes, “My understanding of all this involves a sense […] that it is a far from merry thought that a child can be emotionally dependent on, and relieved not to be separated from, an environment answering so meanly to her needs for closeness and comfort.”  Perkins isn’t digging for hidden meanings, in the sense of “you think the movie is saying this but it's REALLY saying this,” nor is he engaged in a critique of the movie's ideology.  He’s taking the movie on its own term and everything he’s talking about is right there on the surface. In the movie, the fantasy world of Oz really is colourful, wondrous, and alive in a way that Kansas isn’t, even though we also come to see its threatening side as well. Similarly, Kansas really is deadening and limited, even though we come to see the appeal of “home.” Whether or not you accept Perkins’ analysis, you can see how a movie, even something as seemingly uncomplicated as The Wizard of Oz, can contextualize and complicate its subject.  By following the shifts in tone and mood throughout a movie you can better attend to and articulate a movie’s theme in a way that honours the details of a movie itself. Conceiving of theme in this way will also help you avoid the objections that opponents of thematically focused criticism usually have with discussions of theme, namely, that they reduce a work—which is fundamentally an experience, not an argument—to an fixed idea."
TrueFilm,3bt6nt,MBSquared,52,Wed Jul 1 23:06:58 2015 UTC,"If you're gonna bring up Tim Burton, then why not bring up Guillermo del Toro? He certainly has a fascination for creatures. Pan's Labyrinth, Cronos, Blade II, Splice, Pacific Rim, the Hellboy films... you can see that there are a lot of examples in his oeuvre.  Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson deserve mention as well. Raimi for his Deadites, which are creatures more than simply animated corpses. Jackson for his early work on films such as Braindead and Bad Taste.  Other creatures of note:  The Gremlins  The Babadook  The Xenobites of the Alien films are iconic and cannot be ignored.  The long-haired ghost in Asian horror, exemplified by Sadako in Ringu.  EDIT: And the Graboids of the Tremors series and the Crawlers of The Descent. Peter Jackson, again: the giant creepy crawlies of King Kong. The monsters in Cloverfield and Gwoemul.

I love a lot of those old horror movies, but do creature features really have all that much relevance anymore?  Horror movies tend to reflect the preoccupations of the eras they were made in. The 30s had a lot of medical and science-related horror because there were a lot of rapid advances in that field at that time. Horror died down a bit in the 40s because there was a lot more real-world stuff to be afraid of. In the 50s the world was looking to the skies, either up at the moon, or for approaching missiles, so there were a lot of alien invasion and apocalyptic films. To skip ahead a bit, slasher films were huge in the early 80s as a reaction to real-world horrors like serial killers and Vietnam. These are super-broad generalizations for the sake of summary, but you get the idea.  So in that context, what would a creature feature reveal about our fears and obsessions today? I'm sure that someone could make one, but would it be the best horror movie they could make? I don't know the answer to that. Personally, I feel like the idea of true monsters is becoming increasingly unbelievable. There is a lot of scarier shit happening right now."

TrueFilm,3bt6nt,HannasAnarion,13,Fri Jul 3 03:33:15 2015 UTC,"Classic horror started as creature films.   I disagree. If we open up to other mediums, creature horror came very late to the party. The very first work recognized as ""horror"", The Castle of Otranto had very little supernatural element and no monsterous characters. And then you've got Poe, which was clearly not creature horror, and then Jeckyll and Hyde, which is borderline, and Dorian Grey. Even the original Frankenstein and Dracula were very light on the ""creature"" aspect of the horror, especially Frankenstein was more about the terrible darkness inside of Frankenstein as much as the terror inspired by his creation.   And actually, all of those films got major film adaptations before the Hammer Frankenstein and Dracula.   Creature fiction is at best a subgenre of Horror, and that is debatable. It never has been the ""essence"" of horror."
TrueFilm,3bt6nt,GravitysRainbowRedux,3,Thu Jul 2 01:10:32 2015 UTC,"I will point out The Castle of Otronto does have the gigantic man in armor, which would technically fall under monstrous, though not in the way it is being referred to (with the Universal monsters and such).

Westerns used to be more about claiming untamed lands and overcoming the ""other,"" and for some time they've been more about deconstructing the genre, moral ambiguity, and the end of an era.  Sci-fi went through its phases, from being more colonial to exploring the nature of humanity and philosophy to being steeped in Cold War rhetoric and the consequences of science gone mad to being more militaristic and critical of modern culture and society.  Horror's no different. Everything evolves, and while it would be fun to have a slower, more brooding, creature-based horror film that didn't also feature a group of generally armed protagonists trying to escape from a confined setting, something like The Babadook or It Follows features a meshing of psychological and fantastical elements which mirror to an extent something like Frankenstein.  I'd hate to see us stick with the same old template just because it represents some sort of heritage; wouldn't you rather see the equivalent of something like Night of the Living Dead, which feels new and transgressive and progressive and politically relevant, than the equivalent of any number of the zombie movies which succeeded it?"

TrueFilm,3bt6nt,floopyloopy,13,Thu Jul 2 03:26:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like the age of the internet has made most horror movies redundant.  Horror movies depend on mystery and suspense and a sense of isolation to get scare the viewer: the grown ups won't listen to the teenagers (ala Cassandra Truth), teens are lost in an isolated place and communication is bunk, space was still unexplored territory. The lack of information stimulates our minds and we create all sorts of what ifs because we don't know what's happening.  The Age of information makes it difficult to make good horror movies because it debunks all of our previous myths. There can't be a Dracula because a million people would have tweeted it. There can't be a War of the Worlds because Mars is a hunk of lifeless rock, millions of documentaries are talking about how sharks shouldn't scare you, the thought of nuclear radiation creating gigantic mutant ants was, well, disproven, for obvious reasons, Sadako doesn't come out of the TV set...if you even watch the Ring on TV...with your VHS.  The greatness of horror movies was that, for a long time, people actually believed that those things are real (Remember Orson Welles and his War of the World's radio feature? Try scaring people with your podcast). It's sort of like the world growing up--like Earth's coming of age story.  I still enjoy old horror movies because they best represent their age rather than the mystery: Cat People represented our fear of the exotic, The Invasion of the Body Snatchers represent the Commie Scare, The day the Earth stood still represented the Cold War, Godzilla and Them! represent the nuclear age, Jaws represented our fear of the unknown and unseen, Videodrome encapsulates the TV age and our tendencies to develop unhealthy fetishes, The Ring represented the VHS age.  I feel like a good modern horror should encapsulate our times. Our time is the internet age. The Blair Witch encapsulated horror in the 2000s by using viral marketing in the internet to generate controversy. Obviously The Blair Witch is now just a story but for its time it was quite a feat. Most modern movies fail because they try to replicate an age gone by when they should be reinventing the genre for the new age. Monster movies can still exist--they just need to adapt."

It's difficult for me to think of excellent, supernatural horror films since the year 2000 that are set in the real-world.  All I can think of are The Ring, The Blair Witch Project, and It Follows.  Filmmakers find it easier to scare us with the real and this is a shame because we still have the capacity to be scared by the unreal, just look at the first season of True Detective or the revival of interest in Twin Peaks.  I think audiences would be receptive to more occult/Lovecraftian/cosmic-terror type stories, I know I would.  Also, your post got me thinking.  Is it a stretch to say that the 'creature' film of the late 90s/early aughts was the disaster flick?"
TrueFilm,3box77,TheCheshireCody,9,Tue Jun 30 23:25:19 2015 UTC,"The Fisher King myth is a fertility myth. The King is wounded in his leg (meaning his groin), and thereby becomes impotent. And the whole kingdom loses fertility, withering into a barren wasteland. Without a potent King, there is no kingdom.  So I think we have to look not only at the wounds and healings of Parry and Jack, but also the effects their respective impotencies have on those around them, and on their kingdoms."
TrueFilm,3box77,wmille15,7,Wed Jul 1 05:27:02 2015 UTC,"Since I see no other response, I'll chime in with what little I can muster, having not seen the film for many years and knowing only as much grail-ology as I can recall from some Joseph Campbell stuff also years in my past and glean from Wikipedia...  The Fisher King is the wounded king and keeper of the grail.  He needs to be asked a significant question in order to be healed (in some versions this is ""what ails you, father?"").  I think Gilliam intentionally mixed the two main characters together in terms of their mythological references - both are part Parsifal and part grail-king.  Or it's a fake-out and we think Parry is Parsifal, but Jeff Bridges' character is actually on the quest (need to see this film again!)  The healing question episode is referenced when we find out that their backstory is intimately intertwined (and throws a sort of psycho-therapeutic interpretation onto the healing question).  That's the best I can do"
TrueFilm,3box77,Thelonious_Cube,2,Wed Jul 1 00:58:16 2015 UTC,"I think you're definitely right about both characters being on a quest. Both of them were, in their own way, destroyed that night. Obviously Parry much more so, but Bridges' character (Jack) has lost his career and his passion. I definitely get that the journey is redemptive for both of them, but I find it odd that Jack is the only one who seems to have found success at the very end - the final freeze is on him holding up the ""Grail"" at Parry's bedside - when he really hasn't actually done much of anything to earn it."
TrueFilm,3box77,Thelonious_Cube,2,Wed Jul 1 01:08:35 2015 UTC,"But I expect that's part of the point as well - the ""magical quest"" isn't really magic and won't necessarily fix things.  The more I think about it, the more I like the idea that we're led to believe that Parry is Parsifal, but he's actually the Fisher King and it's Jack's quest"
TrueFilm,3box77,piperson,3,Wed Jul 1 17:29:52 2015 UTC,"Terry Gilliam enjoys writing about characters that are living in two worlds, the ""real"" world and the world of dreams. Sometimes the movies blur the line quite heavily like in Time Bandits and Baron Munchausen. In this case Gilliam is staying very close to ""reality"". I see this movie to be like the Don Quixote story (of which Gilliam is doing a new movie) in that he has a normal/sad character that sees greatness where others only see the ordinary and thus elevates it. Rather than just have random knights, Gilliam uses the King Arthur myth. Unfortunately this method of seeing the world from rose colored glasses doesn't work so well for Parry but it works wonderfully for jaded Jack. He gets a whole new lease on life from Parry's method. In a way, Parry may also be elevated in that now he lives completely in the world of dreams and no longer has to deal with the harshness of ""reality""."
TrueFilm,3box77,Vermilion,2,Wed Jul 1 16:30:58 2015 UTC,"Is ""Parry"" a variation of Percival? The ""FIsher King"" means ""Wounded King"". I think you could have a modern interpretation.   New York City is the setting. ""After hearing a popular DJ rail against yuppies, a madman carries out a massacre in a popular New York bar.""  (Jim Sanders)  You have a UK writer choosing to make an American character in New York. The modern ""Kingdom"".   I almost wonder if it is a direct homage to Campbell, given that Perry is a Professor in New York where Campbell was a teacher.  Campbell: ""In the Middle Ages this was the idea that finally turned that world into something like a wasteland, a land where people were living inauthentic lives, never doing a thing they truly wanted to because the supernatural laws required them to live as directed by their clergy. In a wasteland, people are fulfilling purposes that are not properly theirs but have been put upon them as inescapable laws. This is a killer. The twelfth-century troubadour poetry of courtly love was a protest against this supernaturally justified violation of life's joy in truth. So too the Tristan legend and at least one of the great versions of the legend of the Grail, that of Wolfram von Eschenbach. The spirit is really the bouquet of life. It is not something breathed into life, it comes out of life.""  More directly, from a 1986 interview:    JOSEPH CAMPBELL:  In the Grail legend young Perceval has been brought up in the country by a mother who refused the courts and wanted her son to know nothing about the court rules. Perceval's life is lived in terms of the dynamic of his own impulse system until he becomes more mature. Then he is offered a lovely young girl in marriage by her father, who has trained him to be a knight. And Perceval says, ""No, I must earn a wife, not be given a wife."" And that's the beginning of Europe.  BILL MOYERS: The beginning of Europe?  JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Yes -- the individual Europe, the Grail Europe.  Now, when Perceval comes to the Grail castle, he meets the Grail King, who is brought in on a litter, wounded, kept alive simply by the presence of the Grail. Perceval's compassion moves him to ask, ""What ails you, Uncle?"" But he doesn't ask the question because he has been taught by his instructor that a knight doesn't ask unnecessary questions. So he obeys the rule, and the adventure fails.  And then it takes him five years of ordeals and embarrassments and all kinds of things to get back to that castle and ask the question that heals the king and heals society. The question is an expression, not of the rules of the society, but of compassion, the natural opening of the human heart to another human being. That's the Grail."

I prefer the remake, it's one of my favourite westerns. The script is tighter, the performances are better, the cinematography is both grander and more intimate and the villains feel more human. While Chaney is still presented as a terrible person, Lucky Ned actually appears as a somewhat likeable character. I also love how it balances tone. It features a lot of wit and humour, but overall is still a much bleaker and more honest film than Hathaways."
TrueFilm,3blg7g,isarge123,11,Tue Jun 30 08:26:49 2015 UTC,"I cannot agree more with the villains being more 'human'. One of my favorite aspects of the remake is this air of uncertainty, ignorance, and rash decision making from the bandits, namely Josh Brolin. It seems fitting that outlaws during the wild west would have been somewhat uneducated or dull witted, thus isolating them from the standard society and driving them into life of an outlaw. While the entire crew of bad guys are this way, Barry Pepper, the leader of the crew seems to be of a higher iq, which again makes sense and fits that characterisation, while he also cannot hold his own intellectually with Maddie."
TrueFilm,3blg7g,ThorsGrundle,5,Tue Jun 30 13:53:13 2015 UTC,I love how obviously Pepper hates Chaney for getting them into so much trouble.  He's far friendlier with both his hostage and enemy than with his own ally.

Saying that he's ""no movie star"" but instead a character actor makes it sound like you've only ever seen him in the Big Lebowski.

I felt the actress portraying Mattie Ross in both films were outstanding. I think what really felt different for me was the acting of Jeff Bridges to John Wayne. I really think Wayne did a great job in this movie and Bridges to me felt solid but not really exceptional. Wayne in my opinion made Rooster a great and interesting character. Right when we meet him as he's drunk debating with Ross in his house I grew entrapped. This gun for hire (as I remember) was wasted and talking about how he didn't want to work for this girl and despite his annoyance with her persistent nagging he grows to accept her offer (can't remember what caused this). Slowly but surely he realizes his affinity for this girl and finds a need to aid her in avenging her family. By the end of the film I was cheering for Wayne like my favorite football team. He captured so much within the role that Bridges failed to articulate imo. Both films are good but to me the original is a better/more convincing story.

Paper Moon does allude to Addie being Moze's daughter, although never implicitly.  Great post however I feel there is some stretching in order to make the films themes fit. The central greed masked by religion and piety does run through I think the style and mis en scene is determined by the time periods."

TrueFilm,3bk2um,postdarwin,2,Tue Jun 30 01:45:11 2015 UTC,"I think whether Addie is or is not Moze's daughter is one of those great unsolved questions.  There is some evidence to prove that Addie is Moze's daughter but not enough to be conclusive.  And yeah I do think the style and mis en scene isn't an as big influence on There Will Be Blood than thematic elements.  The costume design and character design, however, I will argue are big influences on There Will Be Blood. What I find more interesting is that the mis en scene and style of both films are some-what removed from their respective time periods.  Paper Moon feels more like a picture from the 30s-40s (especially apparent when Bogdanovich uses deep focus cinematography) while There Will Be Blood feels like an epic from the 60s (in part because of how much Paul Thomas Anderson borrows from 2001: A Space Odyssey)."

TrueFilm,3bk2um,rough_outline,3,Tue Jun 30 05:50:01 2015 UTC,"This is where the two works differ. Paul Thomas Anderson flips the structure of Paper Moon around. Whereas Addie is distant from Moze and slowly becomes closer and closer to Moze throughout the rest of the film, H.W. instantly finds comfort in Daniel, but drifts further and further away from him.   Its relevant that when Mose meets Addie, Addie is already a young child. Whereas Daniel adopts HW as an orphaned baby.  In Paper Moon, I didn't feel as if Addie was returning to greed, rather returning to family. She is parted from Moze for a very short period, but the sense of yearning is so strong, that she immediately has to run back to him. And whilst Moze doesn't ever verbalise it explicitly, it seems like he's umming and arring about going back for Addie too, before she shows up. I wouldn't read it mainly as a take on greed, more the power of family bonds.  All throughout the film, all Addie wants to do is please Moze, this manifests in helping him perform scams. However, she shows altruism too, whether its wanting to help a family broken down on the side of the road or not scam a single mother with many mouths to feed and not a lot of money. I think she is Moze' redemption.  The comparison to There Will Be Blood is very interesting. In Paper Moon, Addie is a fully fledged character right off the bat. Whereas in TWBB, HW doesn't speak a lot, and is often both literally and metaphorically a prop for Daniel. It is only after he gets older and after he has lost his hearing, that we really hear him (too cheesy?). I think it would be beneficial to look at Daniel's relationship with his false brother Henry too.  I could write for days about the relationship of HW and Daniel in There Will Be Blood. It is difficult to decide whether there is genuine affection or Daniel simply keeping him happy so he can further exploit him. With a classic non-committal answer, I'd say its a bit of both.  As you've pointed out, the endings are distinct. Whereas Addie and Moze embrace their reunion. When HW returns to Daniel, it leads to a bitter fracture. I think this can be read a number of ways. Daniel is simply being hateful and lashing out. Daniel is purposely pushing HW away, as a merciful gift to the only good he has ever had in his personal life. Its another testament to Daniel's unbridled competitiveness, even though he genuinely does love HW. And so on. Its hard to put a finger on a true interpretation, its an extremely ambiguous film in that regard.  To chop this ramble to a close. I think you're spot on with the similarity in themes. Though I think the visual cues is stretching it and detracts from the rest of your analysis."
TrueFilm,3bk2um,FrogManJoness,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:39:28 2015 UTC,"I didn't feel as if Addie was returning to greed, rather returning to family.   I think that's where the complexity of the film is made apparent.  The irony is that she abandons her family because she misses her 'family'.  But that 'family' is a man who lives a life of greed and excess.  Addie still however finds a sense of fatherhood with Moze.  It ties back to that theme of the mixing between family and greed.  And it is through that estuary where we as an audience have that moment of self-reflection.   I think she is Moze' redemption.   I agree, if it weren't for her Moze would be rather unlikable.  Addie brings out the good side in Moze.  I find this too in the case of H.W. and Daniel.  With H.W. and Daniel's case the dynamic is a lot more complicated though.  Because, as you said, it's hard to say whether the affection Daniel shows is genuine or not.   Though I think the visual cues is stretching it and detracts from the rest of your analysis.   I'll admit the visual cues in landscape as well as shot construction are pushing it, but I'm ready to defend the similarities between character design in both works."

I found there to be very few similarities between the film and book. In Oil!, as in a lot of Sinclair's work, socialism is never very far from the forefront. I could word this more eloquently, but basically I think Anderson took the extremely general idea of Oil! as the basis for his movie."

TrueFilm,3bjyfr,BsillySil,14,Mon Jun 29 22:56:07 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, an underappreciated part of filmmaking is great location choices to establish an intriguing world, drawing us in. Mann and his team did this as well in Heat as any movie I've ever seen. Take for example Tom Noonan's hermit-like, satellite dish appointed, tiny dilapidated house on a hill. It felt to me like such a real place, with no hint of cliche, I was totally immersed in the characters' conversation. The other location I think about is DeNiro's sparsely furnished apartment with floor to ceiling windows giving endless views of the Pacific- a perfect metaphor for DeNiro's character's personality, all business, always looking forward, toward that moment when he gets the big score to allow him to sail off into the proverbial sunset.  Also the expansive space of the refinery/container yard where the crew spies back on the investigators. One of the best things movies like Heat can do is take us places and put us in worlds we have never been, and consequently making the story being told infinitely richer."
TrueFilm,3bjyfr,pietre_rb,2,Tue Jun 30 04:06:19 2015 UTC,"I found the locations completely grounded in realism, for the reasons you've mentioned. It is an underappreciated artform, but scene settings work best when they enhance the story being told without calling too much attention to themselves. Noonan, had I not been familiar with his resume, I would've thought had been living there for years. Heat was excellent in creating a believable world."
TrueFilm,3bjyfr,-AlternateEnding-,11,Tue Jun 30 18:52:27 2015 UTC,"Heat is such a perfectly executed film. I have a special apreciation for this movie because I saw it at a time when I was becoming very cynical about films and dismissed a lot of mainstream conventional movies. Heat is very conventional, it is was a box office hit, and it is extremely well done. The writing is great at making sure every scene and character ends up serving another part of the plot or another character. When I walked out of the theater I remember thinking how long the movie was and starting to wish that it had been a bit shorter, but when I thought through I realized every single scene served a very important purpose that elevated the entire film. The film also has the best written game of cat and mouse I have ever seen. Pacino and De Niro always seem to be one step ahead of each other, and by devoting equal screen time to both sides, the audience empathizes and roots for both equally, something rarely scene in crime dramas."
TrueFilm,3bjyfr,strangenchanted,6,Tue Jun 30 01:30:29 2015 UTC,"I found the timing of the film's release significant also in that it debuted not too long after Pulp Fiction (probably a year or so after), and most crime films by that time were emulating Tarantino's style of storytelling. Mann's film was more traditional--due to his sensibilities, as well as the production going on as Pulp Fiction became popular, I think--which made it more of a throwback for audiences still not accustomed to Tarantino's particular brand."
TrueFilm,3bjyfr,strangenchanted,8,Tue Jun 30 18:31:53 2015 UTC,For me it has to be when McCauley (De Niro) makes the decision outside the hotel  to give up on his guaranteed freedom to go and kill Waingro - every time I watch it that scene makes me feel sick (in a good way).  I think that is why Waingro is so passive in his death scene as the filmmakers deliberately didn't want that scene to be 'satisfying' and hence you are again pushed into thinking about how it wasn't worth it.
TrueFilm,3bjyfr,PantheraMontana,2,Tue Jun 30 01:26:42 2015 UTC,"Given its placement within the story, I think Waingrow's death scene also served as a unique juxtaposition with the climactic scene between Hanna and McCauley. It touches on two different versions of justice."
TrueFilm,3bii59,AllPowerToTheSoviets,3,Mon Jun 29 14:34:28 2015 UTC,"Having read Chaplin's biography (David Robinson's ""Chaplin: His Life and Art""—worth the effort in conjunction with Chaplin's autobiography), it seems Chaplin held a long-standing fascination with dream sequences. Robinson suggests that this arose from appearing in a Fred Karno sketch called, ""Jimmy the Fearless, or the Boy 'Ero"", in which Chaplin played a ragamuffin who embarks on a series of misadventures before waking up and realizing his exploits were all just a dream. One actor named Stanley Jefferson, who played Jimmy for a single performance—Chaplin gave Stanley the boot once he realized the role's promise—suggested the same thing:   ""Charlie loved to play Jimmy, and the memory of that role and of the production stayed with him all his life, I think. You can see Jimmy the Fearless all over some of his pictures — dream sequences, for instance. He was fond of them, especially in his early pictures. And when it comes down to it, I've always thought that poor, brave, dreamy Jimmy one day grew up to be Charlie the Tramp.""  Though I can't place the particular thematic reasoning for that scene in The Kid outside of its comedic promise within the plot, I'd agree with Robinson in saying that it probably stemmed from his larger appreciation for dream sequences."
TrueFilm,3bii59,JTati,2,Tue Jun 30 01:36:33 2015 UTC,"I actually just watched that film yesterday since I've been going back through Chaplin lately.  And I'll admit it struck me as a bit odd as well.  I enjoyed the scene itself but then I realized the film was just about over and I was a bit confused as to how they would wrap it up so quickly and what the scene was supposed to add..    The only compelling argument I've heard so far is if you look at the film as a Christian allegory.  There certainly seems to be a lot to suggest this: the cross symbol in the beginning, the 'virgin' mother (or at least absent father figure), the artist/father burning her portrait (indifferent creator), the constant praying, Chaplin being shot in the dream only to be awoken and go to the real paradise (mother's home)."
TrueFilm,3bj5xh,SomalEa,28,Mon Jun 29 17:36:03 2015 UTC,"Godard was obsessed with Brechtian alienation and this scene exemplifies that. What Godard is trying to achieve is to bring the audience out of the movie, in other words make them realize they are watching a movie. A lot of his editing in Breathless is made to do that, and some of his later films like Weekend contain this technique to an even larger degree. Godard was never interested in lulling the audience into empathy or using conventional narrative techniques to help the audience suspend their disbelief.  Godard's infatuation with Brecht comes along rather naturally with his communist political ideology. Brecht believed that theatre which brought out the audience's pathos could be very manipulative and subtly indoctrinate the audience, placing ideologies into their heads without them being able to realize this was happening. With Brechtian technique, artists usually hope to allow the audience more freedom in forming their interpretation of the happenings within a story. Godard simply brought this technique into the medium of film.  TLDR: This scene is just another example of Godard, inspired by Brecht, breaking away from conventional narrative technique to stimulate the audience and make them an active part of the piece."
TrueFilm,3bj5xh,Starphysics,2,Mon Jun 29 21:34:59 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen Breathless in months but I do believe in that borrowed apartment there were some musings about existence stray-painted on the walls.  I can't remember exactly what was on the walls, but I think there was something about ""who"" amidst it all.  I know Breathless and a lot of the French New Wave find influences from existentialism, namely from Sartre and Camus.  In that way, I could see the shot being a representation of authenticity and how we project a certain image of the self upon ourselves and society.  The duality of the lenses could perhaps  be a comment of the nature of bad faith.  We see the two faces of Michel.  One eclipsed by the shade and another which reveals itself fully to us.  Who is the real Michel though?  Michel faces the camera directly as if posing the question directly to the audience.  I feel that perhaps this moment establishes the inner struggle of Michel fighting for his identity.  He is torn between two constructions of self.  I think it's development for the ending of the film where he finally asserts his self by refusing to go with the police and getting shot down."

His, and French New Wave in general, films are pretty ""experimental"" in regards to their editing, so you get shots like a character looking straight into the camera during a conversation or some action.  As for the glasses thing, also probably another ""experimental"" element. ""Out of place"" seems to be somewhat of a staple of his films."
TrueFilm,3bfvs3,sharkeyspizz,58,Sun Jun 28 21:29:27 2015 UTC,"I've written some thoughts about this very scene before.  The Apartment is one of the best movies ever made. Jack Lemmon delivers one of the best performances in American cinema.  Anyone who bemusedly questions why I think Jack Lemmon was the best American actor need not turn anywhere but this scene, where C.C. Baxter (Lemmon), the meek'n'weak up-and-comer in an oppressive 1960s insurance firm, has a chat with Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacClaine), the quiet elevator girl. (The moment occurs specifically at 46:19, to those who have Netflix and want to see it for yourselves.) Wilder's ear for dialogue has never failed him, and Lemmon's line deliveries are always brisk and full of joy, but here it's somehow different. Lemmon has one key line to deliver:  ""Ms. Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a Second Administrative Assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character. And as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. Decency-wise, or....otherwise-wise! (guffaw) Cheers!""  That little guffaw, which I can't describe in words, and the way Lemmon delivers his line (the subtext reads: ""I am so confident I've got my idealized vision of Fran worked out!"") are all little character quirks that Lemmon inserts into C.C. Baxter that makes Baxter a treasure of life. It's such a delight to see an actor like Lemmon invest himself so emotionally into his characters that everything seems spontaneous and lively as a result. I'm not seeing an actor, so much as the closest approximation the arts can come to real life (which is pretty fuckin' close).  What we have here is the essence of a dreamer, a schemer, and a believer. It's what makes Jack Lemmon hit so close to home. I see a lot of myself in Jack's characters: how they're always subservient to the main stars (be they a Marilyn Monroe or a Walter Matthau), how they yearn for that special something that makes their fractured & neurotic selves complete, and especially how they hurt. The scenarios are always different (cackling Dick Dastardly, crossdressing jazz musician, editor of a front-page paper, washed-up Willy Loman, Vice President, etc.), but Lemmon the everyman is always consistent.  Jack Lemmon's bashful Baxter, Shirley MacClaine's fractured Fran, and Billy Wilder's deadpan direction all provide the reasons why I critique movies in my spare time. I microanalyze every little aspect that is apparent in a movie and its various elements. Then, putting them all together, I get a vision of a world that is moving and mysterious. When I see the film next time, I won't think about Lemmon's little laugh so much as gasp in delight at the creation of an infinitely interesting, stammeringly complex human being in front of me, projected at twenty-four frames per second in a stock thirty-five millimeters in width. Each movie is just a little square in a vast, ever-expanding quilt that help make up who I am as a person, and what I see in the world. The movies help us make sense of the world just a little bit, though. Other necessary elements--social interactions, love, death, the natural sciences, spirituality--are just a few of the vast ingredients that make up the totality of human existence. We must recognize this, and see how movies like The Apartment and characters like Jack Lemmon's C.C. Baxter are worth studying. They aren't just celluloid plasticities projected to make us feel better about our lives and to idealize the hell out of who we are. They are us. We're seeing people take their personality and inject it into a persona. It's a mingling of truth and fiction that is life-changing to witness if you know what you're looking for."

Also, the significance of the broken mirror is unclear, so Lemmon's reaction feels really odd.  Really tightly written and expertly-acted movie, but I think /u/montypython22's praise is over the top. I mean, I don't disagree with the analysis of the scene, or that the film is great and why it works so well. I just don't think it's transcendent or even, dare I say, important.   This, yes:   It's such a delight to see an actor like Lemmon invest himself so emotionally into his characters that everything seems spontaneous and lively as a result.   This, no:   I'm not seeing an actor, so much as the closest approximation the arts can come to real life (which is pretty fuckin' close).   But, I've only seen it once, so who knows."

That being said, on a recent viewing there was one scene that feels absolutely dated at this point - when Baxter is telling Fran that not only does he know where she lives, but a whole bunch of other personal information (like her SSN) because he has reviewed her personnel file. Fran just seems to laugh this off, whereas these days that would seem like such a huge breach of privacy that I'm sure the 2015 Fran would be pissed.  That said, I completely agree about Lemmon being magic here - I will always enjoy how the doctor completely buys into Baxter as a playboy with no compunction whatsoever about who he hurts."

TrueFilm,3bh54x,motherboy3000,6,Mon Jun 29 04:28:22 2015 UTC,"I only saw it once and I feel very divided. The movie looks and sounds gorgeous. Sinoia Caves did a phenomenal job with the score and the retro-futuristic choice of geometry and colours got to me.   I feel like the movie should've maybe been another 15 minutes longer. It was a bit rushed. Here's the thing that separates it from Under the Skin. Under the Skin, while not a straightforward story, was good at giving visual cues as to what the plot was. Beyond the Black Rainbow had a straightforward story with a lot of symbolism instead. And this is why it suffers. The plot itself is only given subtext through the environment and not the characters or direction itself. I'm sure someone will come up with a brilliant explanation for what each aspect represents, but that doesn't solve the entire issue.  I don't mind style over substance at all. Enter the Void had a thin plot but that's in order since that's the type of movie it was and it didn't need much more.   The closest example I can find that describes my feelings is Lost River. On a sensory level it's magnificent and it has a lot of cool concepts. BTBR is edited far, far better, but Lost River is less aimless. Still, it's directors crafting an intriguing world that isn't fully utilised.   Also I feel like the acting was a bit wooden. I get Barry was meant to be crazy, but it was a mediocre showing. Still, I enjoyed the movie as I'm one of those people who like ""pretentious"" (for lack of better word) movies."
TrueFilm,3bh54x,TrumanB-12,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:04:34 2015 UTC,"My problem with beyond the black rainbow is the style over substance. I'm not talking about the lack of plot or character, just that I don't think the film meant anything. It was pretentious and empty and so I didn't feel driven to dig into the symbolic imagery to find meaning because there wasn't any.   Someone else on the thread compared this film to into the void, but into the void got it right. Everything was there for a reason, to put you in the main characters shoes, make you feel like him, make you experience what he is experiencing, and drive the emotion of what your seeing.  I don't feel like Black rainbow does this. I feel like it's devoid of meaning, so it's not pushing an emotion, characters, ideas or plot. It's not pushing anything at all, just empty ""artsy"" images.   So it bore and frustrated me, as it had potential and that was wasted."
TrueFilm,3bh54x,henrythebrown,3,Mon Jun 29 18:02:24 2015 UTC,"The themes are simple but that doesn't mean they aren't there. Its about high-minded ideals of scientific and psychedelic utopianism going bad. The deug trip scene illustrates idead from Aldous Huxley's two part essay series on psychedelic experiences.  As for ""style over substance"", its a common phrase but how could such a movie exist? Style and substance are inseperable."
TrueFilm,3bh54x,Bat-Might,2,Tue Jun 30 04:46:49 2015 UTC,"I watched it for the first time recently and had a different experience. I enjoyed the style enough that I was drawn into what was happening to try to interpret the meaning. I don't think there's a lack of meaning in the film, it's just left so open to different interpretations because of the lack of exposition outside of the video at the beginning introducing the facility & founder and the limited dialogue.  There's definitely a limit and this can come off as pretentious, but I believe it's more drawing you in by the spectacle enough that you want to think about it and in this instance it worked for me. I think this plays on your expectations & if you're going in expecting a clear narrative as in most mainstream film it can leave you feeling like it's incomplete or has no meaning. It asks something of the audience to interpret & I've felt that way about enough movies to see how a movie like this could be unenjoyable. When I first watched it I thought it was more of a scifi horror movie, especially with the music, costumes, and supernatural powers reminding me of 80s carpenter & other horror movies. Just an old school slow burner.  But the more I think about it I think it's at least part a criticism of television & tv audiences. chuck kollars explores some of the different themes and interpretations better than I could. Some of the imagery in the film leads me to this; the founder's drug addled retreat from reality into watching the television, the protagonist's brief smile that quickly leaves when flipping through channels. The way the film is presented requiring more from the audience drives this point home for me."
TrueFilm,3bh54x,element8,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:57:39 2015 UTC,"I think you might be right about needing to approach the film without expectations of a clear narrative or suggested interpretations. So many film goers are uncomfortable being left with more questions than answers. I personally don't have a problem with this, so I was able to enjoy the experience of Beyond the Black Rainbow, but I could see how this would be a drag if that's not your cup of tea. It's a matter of taste."
TrueFilm,3bh54x,mangalover89,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:59:01 2015 UTC,"It's a beautiful-looking film, and feels like a nightmare - absent narrative logic, it'sa synthesizer based Cabinet of Dr. Caligari without a framing. That said, it's absent any real narrative meat. I'm not  saying it's in need of exposition, because I enjoy visual, purely cinematic and minimalist tone poems like this was trying to be. But, none of the images mean anything, even in a Jungian context.  That said, for pure atmosphere, it can't be beat."
TrueFilm,3bgkt1,Positive_pressure,13,Mon Jun 29 01:13:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I think it was the wooden, stilted acting. And, at the time this was supposed to be the film that launched Elizabeth Berkley into stardom. There was a lot of anticipation when the film came out and it fell flat because it was trying to be too serious. I think if they had played it slightly more campy and lurid and were able to translate that self aware wink it could have become a huge hit. As it was it didn't and it's a campy fave to this day but not enough to be remembered as being really sharp witted.   Did I just write a justification of Showgirls? I need to reexamine my life."

TrueFilm,3bgkt1,cleverkid,7,Thu Jul 2 02:44:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with this completely. I've always felt that Showgirls is one of the most criminally misunderstood and under-appreciated films of all time.  There are two things I believe are worth pointing out when discussing this film:   On a technical level the film is remarkably well put together. The cinematography, editing, production design, blocking, and score are all great. Paul Verhoeven as a director, is famous for taking usual genre tropes and exaggerating them to the point of intentional comedy. In Starship Troopers, the usual excessive gung-ho violence, dehumanization of enemy combatants, and die-hard patriotism inherent to most war films is taken to such an absurd level, that at first we can't help but laugh at it; but as the movie goes on and on, the reality of what it is sinks in: propaganda. But its intentional obviousness is what clues us in that it's just satire, rather than a poorly made film. It's simply poking fun at propaganda war movies.   Showgirls is, in my opinion, a similar idea; the key difference being that Showgirls isn't a war movie. It is a ""star-is-born: melodrama, so rather than exaggerate violence, it exaggerates the typical elements of melodrama films: inane dialogue, hammy acting, and, of course, sexuality. It is easy to laugh at the film when it starts, because of the ridiculousness of it all, but when we get to that awful rape scene, the reality of what it is exactly the audience is giggling at is laid bare."
TrueFilm,3bgkt1,ElfenSpice,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:48:59 2015 UTC,"then we get to that awful rape scene, the reality of what it is exactly the audience is giggling at is laid bare.   So, it is your feeling the rape scene is intended to be entirely over the top to the point that the writer is speaking directly to the audience; saying, this is the message of our film - the quick and uncaring consumption?"
TrueFilm,3bgkt1,Vermilion,2,Tue Jun 30 07:58:11 2015 UTC,"In a sense, yes. The sexuality in the rest of the film is campy to the point of hilarity, but it is still exploitation. The characters in the film are exploiting themselves, exploiting each other, and even the film itself exploits its actors, all with the goal of financial success and hedonistic pleasure seeking. But the fact that the audiance is inclined to laugh at its excesses makes them complicit in this exploitation, and because of they are complicit, the intense out-of-the-blue brutality of the rape scene is like a punch in the face.  Paul Verhoeven did more-or-less the same thing with Robocop. When the ED-209 blows the boardroom executive into pieces we laugh at it. When Murphy is similarly blown to pieces by jeering thugs, our previous laughter at the films excessive violence is used against us to make us feel even worse.  That's pretty much my position on Showgirls. It's the Robocop of melodramas."
TrueFilm,3bgkt1,ElfenSpice,11,Tue Jun 30 13:14:53 2015 UTC,"Amen. I LOVE Showgirls. I think it's one of the definitive films about America, along with Do the Right Thing and other masterpieces of that ilk.   Just to back up what you said, it absolutely is an art film, it's subtext -- which is summed up really well in this article and this comment -- is more sophisticated and meaningfull than 99% of even art films.   On top of that, since it's by Verhoeven it's incredibly fun.   Finally, Verhoeven's a bit of a misanthrope. In almost all of his films that I've seen, most notably Starship Troopers, he hates all of the characters. Understandable, and it serves the films well, but in Showgirls, with Elizabeth Berkeley's character and her friend, he finally sympathizes and empathizes with characters and it serves to make the film that much more effective.  Great points about Showgirls indicting a culture rather than a fictional individual, but I think that's better suited as praise for it rather than as an explanation for why people were turned off by it. Simply enough, I think it's because of the nudity. People just can't handle nudity for some reason. Robocop and Starship Troopers feature the same super-exaggerated styles that people claim to right off Showgirls for having, and yet those two are obviously praised. The only difference between those films is that those two have violence and Showgirls has nudity.   The negative reaction to Showgirls only strengthens its case as a masterpiece, as it only proved how astute the film actually is."
TrueFilm,3bgkt1,cattymills,8,Mon Jun 29 06:51:13 2015 UTC,"The issue with Showgirls is Joe Esterhauz, the dude's script is just endlessly bad. Raping one of the few sympathetic characters on-screen really sours the rest of the movie's experience. Verhoeven is a genius for sure, but I'm not sure even he could have spun the flax of Showgirls' script into gold.  The novelty of an NC-17 rating was not worth the controversy and reduced number of screens it showed on, and the fact that it has far less violent and even slightly less sexual content than other R-rated movies is really interesting, because what it did show was a woman enjoying sex, and that's the big no-no, according to the puritanical MPAA"

Yes, but nobody - even the people who would still hold that against the movie - were never interested in it as a screenplay. Does this make the story of Gravity deficient in any way? Of course not! It's only an inconsequential one and in the end, so what? That was never the point of the movie and we all knew this."

There is a concept that people seem to hold that a ""known story"" means a problem is solved.  That since there are so many stories with similar themes and structures - that there is no need for any more.  Some artists directly rebel against this attitude:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_9QooYDYtU -- Even when their fellow artists (John Lennon) speaks it - not just the audience / fans.  We all have to face life and death. And even if the plot seems linear, the issue we face is still truth and deep.  The mystery of life is always deep, inside every person.  It is only if you view things as outside and simple that you have removed the spirit of art and the human beings that are originating that art.   Yeah, that always bugs me as a criticism about Gravity.   Joseph Campbell at age 82: ""I don't think there is any such thing as an ordinary mortal. Everybody has his own possibility of rapture in the experience of life. All he has to do is recognize it and then cultivate it and get going with it. I always feel uncomfortable when people speak about ordinary mortals because I've never met an ordinary man, woman, or child.""  These writers do not seem like simpletons who do not understand exactly why they made the story simple. Charlie Rose interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZEwzMiAhE8"
TrueFilm,3bgkt1,Vermilion,3,Wed Jul 1 18:41:19 2015 UTC,"the protagonist's behavior is more of a sincere attempt to emulate people around her, and the unintended consequences are more of a critique of a culture rather than an individual person   I don't know if we watched the same Showgirls, but that's not the case at all. The movie basically rips off All About Eve in both premise and in characterization. Nomi and Cristal are both immediately dislikable characters with nothing really redeemable about either one - hell, Nomi can't even dance well yet every character tries to pass her off as ""She dances amazing!"". In the meantime, the film doesn't hide that most of their actions are morally heinous and that it's just a struggle for one of them to come out on top as the most popular showgirl in Vegas. That's basically the synopsis of the movie, even if you ignore any satirical subtext.  In the meantime, one shouldn't need to show case any unintended consequences in order to be read as satire. It takes more than just whether or not your show your character receive his or her just desserts. And there were a lot more personal consequences in Showgirls than in Nightcrawler - Nomi's past is discovered and used against her so she's forced out of Vegas, Molly is raped and put under hospitalization, Cristal is put out of show business for an indefinite period.  The reason Showgirls got backlash is because everything about it has the surface of a broken film (plus a really tasteless rape scene in its final third) and, while I love the film and think its satirical in its elements, there's no way I can fault anyone for thinking it is 100% a bad movie. You can't exactly use ""it's bad on purpose"" as an excuse, that seems like evading criticism."
TrueFilm,3bgkt1,STinG666,2,Wed Jul 1 18:26:38 2015 UTC,"There is a an awful lot of literature about Showgirls the art film that people seem to ignore.

Another huge validation for me was when I read that both Jacques Rivette and Eric Rohmer thought very highly of Showgirls, even compared to his other '90s work. They know a little more on the subject than anyone I know personally.   http://www.slantmagazine.com/features/article/100-essential-films"
TrueFilm,3bgkt1,Athenian_Dubstep,2,Mon Jun 29 14:27:03 2015 UTC,"Having looked at some of the articles here--and a few elsewhere--I think the thing that is preventing me from appreciating Paul Verhoeven as a director is the fine line between glorification and criticism present in his films. There seems to be a fair amount of misogyny in his films (of the ones I've seen, at least: Total Recall, Showgirls, Robocop) as well as what appears to be an uncritical celebration of hypermasculinity and violence. Outside of that there's just a general cynicism and meanness to his films that I find unpalatable. I am curious about some of his Dutch films, particularly The Fourth Man, so there's that"

Is Magic Mike the best film on the subject of sex work? No, but it's far more sophisticated and relatable than Showgirls. I don't know if it's a consequence of Joe Esterhauz's script or if it's Paul Verhoeven's directing or somewhere inbetween but none of the characters in Showgirls is sympathetic or believable. Hell, Demi Moore is, at best, a passable actress and she was at least entertaining in Strip Tease. I'll take a look at some of those articles but I'm really struggling to see how Showgirls could be viewed as an art film, accidental or otherwise."

TrueFilm,3bgkt1,Vermilion,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:15:54 2015 UTC,"I think Verhoven had to be aware of how bad the script was, and just took it to extremes. Unfortunately for Elizabeth Berkeley, she actually thought she was in a seriously, respectable, hollywood picture. She probably trusted her director, even though he essentially played her like a puppet. The only person who seemed to know what was going on was Gina Gershon.   Either way, I fucking love Showgirls and I wouldn't change one thing about it. Everything is so over the top, you can't help but admire it. It's the most delicious trash."

People will say it was too Mallick-which is to say it was too much in his head and not enough given to the aduience. Tree Of Life and To The Wonder are both films that are honest and real, yet one is a masterpiece and the other a flop. Finding the difference between the two, to me, is most important.   Also its really sad my least favorite Mallick's are the only ones you've seen."

TrueFilm,3bejg2,clearncopius,23,Sun Jun 28 14:20:19 2015 UTC,"Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), John Carpenter- No one does the “last man standing” flick better than John Carpenter (see: The Thing), but this was very underwhelming. A very simple story: a Los Angeles precinct is being shut down, yet a prison bus decides to stop there as well as a man on the run from gang members, who then proceed to try to siege the precinct. And that is literally it. The film plays out entirely like an arcade video game. You have good guys and bad guys, with little reason as to why they are pitted against each other and what they are doing. I assume the gang members leading the assault are just anarchists, because they have little reason to risk so much in the precinct for just one man. Or maybe their motive lies a very ambiguous opening sequence in which some members are shot for no reason. But adding to the video game analogy, The building is swarmed by a seemingly never ending enemy, who all are easily shot dead by the “heros.” Speaking of these “heros”, they are so underdeveloped you have no emotional attachment to them whatsoever. Not to mention you know which characters will live and which will die from the very beginning. It is a okay action flick with some suspense but very underwhelming to say the least. 6.5/10   National Lampoon’s Vacation (1983), Harold Ramis- When you asked your parents, “what is the funniest movie you’ve ever seen?”, this was probably their answer. National Lampoon’s Vacation has aged like a fine wine; the comedy is still relevant, the scenes are still iconic, and the movie is still funny. It is a great story about a man who feels lost and disconnected from his own family, and tries to in some way reconnect with them by taking them to a theme park where he experienced his most beloved childhood memories. Of course the road to said theme park is just a highway to hell, filled with comedy at every exit. Still, the film isn’t something that a modern, young viewer would laugh their heads off at, but it’s comedy that they can still be amused with and appreciate. The hardest part about comedy is the aging process, but this film has survived the last 30 years well. A good film on all accounts. 7/10   Dazed and Confused (1993), Richard Linklater- Grab a beer, roll a joint, pop in some Aerosmith and enjoy the ride. With his psychedelic teen flick Richard Linklater transports the audience back to the 1970’s, when rock and roll filled the airwaves and smoke filled the backseat. The film stars a host of young actors including soon to famous Milla Jovovich, Ben Affleck, and Matthew McCaughnehey, as they celebrate their last day of junior year. As much as it is a raunchy teen comedy, Dazed and Confused doesn’t hold back as it tells the full teenage experience. Not just the sex and drugs, but it goes much deeper than that. It criticizes a lot of the teenage experience. One is the insanity of “freshman initiation rituals,” another is the peer pressure that some students face of trying to fit in with the hip crowd, and another, and probably the most important, is the desire not to peak in high school. We all remember those kids, the ones who would spend 99% of their time drinking, smoking, fucking, and having a good time in high school. They seemed to have the life, didn’t they? Well, take McCaughehey’s character. He’s seen as the epitome of cool, everyone loves him, but think about his background. He’s already graduated from high school, yet he comes and hangs around with graduated juniors for kicks, and spends all his time smoking and driving. What is so cool about spending your adult life partying with high schoolers? The message of the film comes into focus when the main character, the school’s star quarterback, says “If I ever start referring to these days as the best years of my life, remind me to kill myself.” Of course there is more than this, a lot is said in the film about fighting against rules, capturing your own individuality and finding out where you fit in. No one captures the teenage experience on camera better than Linklater. 9/10  Rosewater (2014), Jon Stewart- A modern political film in all aspects, Rosewater delves into the Iranian election of 2009 and the outrage it caused in Iran and around the world. The film goes further and gives a behind the scenes look at the Iranian government’s crackdown on journalism, media, and free speech. We follow Maziar Bahari, an Iranian-Canadian reporter sent to cover the 2009 election. Being a journalist from a Western nation, Bahari is a man the Iranian government sees as their biggest threat: a Westerner with a camera. After filming an anti-government protest which erupts into violence, Bahari is incarcerated and tortured for months by the Iranian government. The film depicts his fall into a broken man, and then back up again until his time of release. Yet by the end of the film, not much seems to be accomplished. Bahari is released, yes, but it does not appear as if he has changed as a character or as a person. He stays relatively the same. They attempt to connect his time in prison with his sister and father, who had both previously spent time in prison, yet you never really see how these connections help him through his own prison experiences. The duality of his captors, who are sometimes brutal, sometimes friendly, and some humor that did not fit with the mood of the film, make for a film that seems poorly put together. While it ultimately fails in story it does succeed in showing the political backwardness of xenophobic, and oppressive nations such as Iran.  It also tries to justify social media as a means to do good; Bahari’s unjust arrest was made known to the world through social media. To some degree, it accomplishes these two goals. Not a bad directorial debut for a world famous fake news anchor. 6/10  Dope (2015), Rick Famuyiwa- In a twist on usual films set in the hood, Dope is a fresh and bouncing comedy about three geeks struggling to survive in a tough neighborhood of Inglewood. The film sizzles with originality and bumps to the tune of it’s own beat. The three main characters don’t fit in with their rough, violent surroundings, yet are thrust into accidentally having to sell an entire bag full of molly. The whole film revolves around this, as well as the main character, Malcolm, a 90’s hip-hop geek, finding his own place in society. On one hand he is so different from the lifestyle that surrounds him, yet at the same time he actively participates in the lifestyle by selling drugs. He is a dual character that has two distinctly different parts of himself. There is the Malcolm striving for Harvard, and there is the Malcolm who sells drugs and pulls a gun on some gang members. This theme that everyone will always be connected and judged by the environment they grew up in, despite how much they try to separate themselves from that upbringing, is the central part of the film. What Dope does not do right are two things: under and over explaining. It under explains in terms of the plot. There are some characters who pop in, then leave. One character is shot in the leg and never heard from again. Some plot points come up, then disappear. Things like that. It over explains when at the end of the film it literally explains the entire meaning of the film by having the main character read his college application essay aloud to the audience. Yes, it gets the message across, but sometimes you need to paint with a finer brush. Also, for the hip hop fans, there are tons of cameos from rappers. A$AP Rocky’s performance is almost as good as his new album. 8/10  Film of the Week: Dazed and Confused"
TrueFilm,3bejg2,drevill,8,Sun Jun 28 14:52:03 2015 UTC,"Since last Sunday:  Jaws (1975) - 5/5 - With the 40th anniversary of this film being last weekend, it was only fitting to watch it for the first time in a few years. It's a testament to how well the film is made that it continues to enthral. Best part of this experience was watching it with my wife, who hadn't watched it in a few years either - she jumped at the same exact spots as before. :D  Life Itself (2014) - 4/5 - Very well made documentary on one of the most important voices in film criticism. Obviously given that it is tinged with sadness does not make it any less inspiring. Roger Ebert was one of the main reasons that my passion for film exploded in the early 90s. His influence on my life is probably immeasurable.  Being Elmo (2011) - 3.5/5 - Okay documentary. The timeline jumps around a lot though. They really needed a more linear edit. Still, seeing the joy that Elmo brings to kids was pretty great, even when the puppeteer is standing right there. In a way it's a love letter to Jim Henson as much as it is to the man who created Elmo, Kevin Clash.  The Heat (2013) - 2.5/5 - So disappointing. I had skipped it until now, but having liked Spy and Bridesmaids, I figured I'd give it a whirl. Rarely laughed, and initially turned it off after twenty minutes but decided I'd finish it because of the goo will of the other films.   There Will Be Blood (2007) - 5/5 - Easily the best film of the past twenty years. Maybe of my lifetime. Paul Thomas Anderson is at the peak of his creative powers here. The music by Johnny Greenwood is mesmerizingly beautiful. Then there's Daniel Day Lewis, who gives a towering performance. For a movie that is often quite deliberate, I'm amazed at quick it moves at times. The first twenty minutes or so do not seem as long as they probably could have. If you haven't seen this film, you owe it to yourself to do so.  Calvary (2014) - 4/5 - John Michael McDonagh's followup to The Guard isn't as funny as that film was, but it's just as vital. Really interesting look at the consequences of choice, even when it is out of your hands. Brendan Gleeson brings a certain melancholy to the role that once again shows how much of a treasure he is. I don't think it's necessarily a profound film, but it approaches that level towards the end.  The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) - 4/5 - Martin Scorsese's reckoning of the humanity and the supernatural of the man who called himself Jesus, the Son of God. If you have any Christian theological background, then you probably will have a lot of issues with the film (they had to put a disclaimer up at the beginning of the film though, since evangelicals & catholics in 1988 were super uptight about the film). If you're okay with creative liberties taken with the gospels, then it can be a very rewarding experience. The last hour of the film is where it truly soars and is what makes Christ's final declaration so powerful. I don't think this film is for everyone but there's a lot to like in it."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,ALTAFOOTBALL,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:35:34 2015 UTC,"I just can't for the life of me, get into There Will Be Blood. I just felt like it had amazing performances, great characters and transformations in relationships, and decent themes. Everything else I felt wasn't up to par, especially the 2nd half of the plot(I know it's a character orientated movie). No Country for Old Men on the other hand, I feel is in my top 5 movies of all time."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,TrumanB-12,7,Thu Jul 2 02:40:36 2015 UTC,"Submarine, Richard Ayoade  A coming of age drama set in the Welsh countryside where a teenage boy struggles to persevere through a new relationship and the risk of his parents divorce. I must say, for a debut, this was incredibly impressive. It wasn't nearly as artsy as it could've been, but it was quite unlike any other similar movie. It's subtle and melancholic as we witness this dreary, troubled life of an idealist, coming to terms as to what the world is. It's superbly edited and the soundtrack by Arctic Monkeys is very fitting. I loved the hazy, almost noir aesthetic and the minimalism of its presentation. This was one of the most relatable stories I've ever seen and as a result, I got so drawn into the characters I started doubting them and their decisions/motivations. I restrained myself from criticism however and while there is definitely space for growth, this is exceptional.   9.1/10  Captain America: The Winter Soldier by Russo brothers  A Marvel movie I genuinely think is good. Wow! This was an enormous surprise for me. May just be the best MCU movie I've seen. The plot isn't anything spectacular, but without spoiling the first movie, there is a conspiracy inside SHIELD and Captain America has to go undercover with Black Widow to open the case up from the inside while being constantly pursued. It's fast paced with well directed action shot with wide lenses that give great environmental scale and a crystal clear view of what's going on. The dialogue was also actually funny for once. Because it had good performances and believable characters, coupled with a lack of reliance on ever present one-liners (Avengers), it allowed the humorous moments to actually be just that. I laughed out loud more than a few times and there was very palpable chemistry between the actors. While the CGI was excellent, much like the other Marvel movies, design choices were rarely spectacular and there was a lack of much aesthetic prowess from the PD team. Also the ""villain"" is far too underdeveloped and doesn't present as much of a threat as he should. That's ultimately what brings it down as a standalone movie. Still, this is the best I've seen from Marvel and the closest piece they've put out that could be considered a great movie.  8.5/10  300 by Zack Snyder  Adapted from the graphic novel, this tells the tale of the select Spartan warriors as they defended Greece from the massive Persian forces. I haven't read the graphic novel myself, but Snyder is at his best with adapted material (ehm Sucker Punch). It's hyper stylised, violent ridiculousness that's so manly it seems also gay at parts. If you want a historical reenactment, 300 is not that. We have ripped, scantily clad Spartans fight a whole host of enemies. Ranging from basic footsoldiers, to undead samurais to rhinos to troll-like creatures. This is all filmed in much slow motion and Snyders trademark swooping shots that work wonders with the talented PD team. The entire movie has a washed out gold, red and white aesthetic that together with the creative costumes only increase the epic nature. The metal score is just the cherry on the cake. In the writing department it's very, very mediocre however. Here the actors are the ones who give personality to the characters, and not the other way around. Everyone is so underwritten and the dialogue is basically men in speedos screaming ""blood, honor, glory"" for the entire runtime. It's so melodramatic but it doesn't really matter. This is a visual treat.  8.5/10  Fantastic Mr Fox by Wes Anderson  Wes Anderson is a guy whose whimsical adaptation of the Roald Dahl story about a fox-farmer conflict does the tale much justice and is even better than the short source material. It's an animated movie, but the voice acting and the characters make it more lifelike than any other animated film. I haven't seen his other work apart from Grand Budapest Hotel, but this is so similar in its meticulousness. It's unique and happy and experimental in all the right ways. I can't really say more about this movie since its one of those you ""experience"", but it's nigh on perfect in my eyes.  10/10  Curse of the Wererabbit by Aardman  (rewatch)  I love Wallace & Gromit. This claymation tale of a mysterious rabbit that ravages crops in preparation for a vegetable competition is still my favourite animated movie. It's simple, quirky, and goes the extra mile to be just that great.   10/10  Kung Fu Panda 2 by Dreamworks  Boy oh boy, where did this go wrong. As someone who loved the first movie, this was incredible disappointing to me. This is about the most plain a decent animated movie can go. I don't mind simple plots and nonstop action in a movie of any sorts. Mad Max:Fury Road was basically an extended chase sequence but it transcended that barrier because it didn't skimp on characters. KFP2 does just that. The action is quite like the first in its over the top nature, but the fun stops there. There is action after action after action for the whole movie and this leaves nothing in its trail. The dialogue is all jokes that the movie is actually quite boring to watch. Po was always silly, but in the first movie the comedy and serious nature was well balanced and gave him some character. Speaking of characters, there was massive room to explore them here. I love the Chinese aesthetic of the series and each animal warrior had the chance to be developed here. None of that happened. Even the villain was so boring and cliché in every possible way. The movie wasn't awful and it still looks good whole having some neat concepts, but it was a bore to watch.   6.7/10"

TrueFilm,3bejg2,lordhadri,13,Fri Jul 3 18:11:07 2015 UTC,"Batman, writing, and Hannibal kept me from films a bit this week. Either that or nothing could compare to the rip-roaring pulse-pounding baddaserry of the first film I watched so what was the point in watching more.   Mad Max: Fury Road Directed by George Miller (2015)- Hyped to death, strengthened even more by its ruffling of insecure dummies, but could it deliver? Guitar squeals and engines flare Yes it could. Fury Road gets right to business going as far as to even speed things up during the less interesting looking scenes to get to the goodness. It’s stripped down but hardly bare. Even as we speed through the world if you think about any part of it the amount of thought put in is obvious. Comparing other modern blockbusters that try introduce us to new worlds seems unfair now. At a script level, visually, and in terms of world building this is the blockbuster with the most personality in years. Stuff like Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or Guardians of the Galaxy feel like boring flatness disguising the personality beneath. Even films I liked such as Edge of Tomorrow come with big caveats like “It gets way more traditional as it goes on”. But this is a blockbuster that actually has a distinct perspective. It shows how personality-less most are because every frame reeks of it here so much so that it’s even making me think I wasn’t harsh enough on its more homogenised blockbuster brethren. When I re-watched Dawn I kept noticing that it seemed like Reeves didn’t know what images in his film were good or impactful so basically showed it all the same way. Miller is the opposite. He’ll effectively fast-forward through underground tunnel scenes cause we’ve seen that kind of thing a bunch (in a way that also heightens the animalistic nature of Max and the war boys) but then take a moment to breathe and watch a flare slowly go out in a storm. He knows what images linger and he lets those last longer. At every turn he knows what can be turned into shorthand, what we should focus on, and just how chaotic to get without losing coherence. Speaking of which man is this crazily well edited. This kind of chaotic editing can so quickly become a blur of unconnected images but not here. The editing captures the frenetic pace of what’s happening without us ever losing a sense of what that is. I don’t mean to rag on Guardians so much but this film had me thinking about it. That film was praised for its personality but compared to this it’s Richard Nixon doing the peace sign. There’s way more explaining of things in that film but nothing actually resonates like it did here. This is also a film with a point of view beyond the general “Friendship” type deals we see in blockbusters. Not only does it have a point of view it’s near forceful in its delivery of that POV with a well earned rage. But it’s not just a polemic. Every pointed moment says as much about the characters and what else is going on as it does the greater themes. Usually when it comes to women in action films the positives come with caveats. Like “sure she’s used for eye candy but at least she had some agency” or whatever but here there’s no qualms or questions. Not only is it passable but actively pushing things forward, it’s not good enough for Fury Road just to have strong female characters in the best sense (i.e. not just making female characters super masculine to make them “strong”) but to fight against those who’d want otherwise. And man, I can’t think of a film in recent memory that’s got so many brilliant declarative statements or quotable lines. “Who Killed the World?”, “We are not things”, “Witness me!”, so many core beliefs or motivations get reduced to brilliantly simple and memorable phrases. I feel like I’ve been conditioned to just accept most blockbusters will have huge chunks of familiar flatness and to look out for the personality buried within but Miller shows that personality doesn’t need disguising. He goes all out, unchained Miller, and it is glory. Practical stunts, willing actors, and technical know-how are what make it great but it’s Miller’s vision that completes it as an action masterpiece. Feels great to have a film be beloved by most for good reason and until the next Max picture it’ll cast a pall on every blockbuster to follow. Outside all its technical and thematic successes it’s just straight fun too. Also shows that teal/orange isn’t inherently boring just the filmmaking attached (cough first Hobbit) that’s dull and flat. If I had any criticisms it’d be that there’s not enough of that sweet guitar.   Battlefield Earth Directed by Roger Christian (2000)- What else would make a worthy follow up to Fury Road? Welp it’s a long film I know that. Even though I love bad movies sometimes the way they’re discussed bothers me. I’ve never gotten into We Hate Movies because their reaction to so many things is “This makes no sense!” and then they pull at the logic of everything. But half the time they’re talking about films where even if they were good, logic and reality wouldn’t necessarily be what the film is concerned with anyway so it’s kinda just fluff to rag on that. I think that’s why I’ve always preferred The Flop House because they usually get into what makes it not work as a film and not why it doesn’t make sense. But this is a film made for the WHM crew as it’s one of the most “This makes no sense” films I’ve ever seen. As in legit “How did we get to this scene from the last” type things. How are these dudes captured if they’re able to freely fly around the planet? I thought they said they had two days and it seems like it’s been ages. WHAT IS HAPPENING. Boy is it dull though. For every crazy John Travolta scene there’s four more of dutch-angled dudes in rags doing random crap. I couldn’t even think of a decent end to that sentence because I can barely remember things that aren’t Travolta laughing as Forest Whitaker does his best dumb-dude face. More of a bore than a blast though. Now it’s a blur of sickly blue coloured slanted shots and the highlights I’d mainly seen already. The scientology angle gives it a weird intrigue and the massive contrast in the ambition of being a new Star Wars and the complete failure to even be coherent makes it an interesting thing to exist. Not necessarily one you need to sit through though.   The Piano Teacher Directed by Michael Haneke (2001)- One of three films this week (along with Fury Road and Day of Wrath) dealing with a woman’s agency and power dynamics between men and women. Haneke’s film being the most intense of the three. Isabelle Hubbert it a poorly treated, sexually fascinated, and talented woman thrust into what what could be her first adult relationship. She seems as if she has collected and fostered her particular sexuality in secret which is now exploding when finally engaged. Haneke’s stillness really seems suited to this character and story. She’s a woman whose job is to judge. As a piano teacher she observes and directs from the side. She’s experienced being cut down her whole life and seems to fuel her own frustrations there into her work. While her home life has her vulnerable she uses her dissatisfaction towards it to cultivate a commanding disposition everywhere else in her life. But as she finds out others don’t like to be controlled as much as she doesn’t, especially not men. Though it’s got a lot on its mind what stuck with me most was how it explored gender dynamics. We get the sense that for men power is a given but for women power is a fetish. Taking what you want as a man is your right, asking for what you want as a woman is a transgression. Hubbert’s particular proclivities are far out and she doesn’t ease her partner into them but the core issue for him is being told what to do. At first he says he’s disgusted and treats her horribly because she’s immoral but in no time he’s back as lustful as ever but still angered by the gaul of her asking for what she wants rather than letting him do whatever. It felt like he was taking the strange phenomenon of dudes being all “Why won’t you date nice guys like me you whore bitch?!” to the furthest place. For him he’s lovely to a point, but once he’s put the work in as he sees it he should be able to reign supreme. Most of the time that’s probably how it works for him, but when he’s met with someone less subservient and more troubled he’s powerless and enraged by that. He doesn’t want to help her nor does he want to indulge her, he just wants to do with her what he wants. She’s hardly perfect, she’s more explicitly troubled than he is, but the line becomes blurred between her genuinely manic moments and the times where she’s just aching for agency as he responds the same way to both. While the film didn’t blow me over like it does some I still dug it. It’s constantly fascinating and quietly intense that isn’t an angry speech like Funny Games but still leaves you plenty to chew on. Hubbert is just the best too."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,The_Silver_Avenger,7,Sun Jun 28 14:20:52 2015 UTC,"Hannah and Her Sisters Directed by Woody Allen (1986)- I feel like I’m soon gonna be getting into the less good Allen films and that’s gonna be a bummer. For a chunk that’s a little what this feels like, lesser Allen with a big good cast (Michael Caine, Allen, Mia Farrow, Barbara Hershey, Carrie Fisher, Dianne Wiest, Max von Sydow). Then as it goes on being consistently witty and intriguing it ties things together in a perfect bow. One of the turning points is one of Woody Allen’s best moments as an actor I’ve seen. An unexpected burst of pure enthusiasm turns this tale of sad intellectuals and artists making stupid decisions, getting caught up in their fears, and not vocalising their problems, into an affirmation of life despite all these things. Maybe Allen gets a little too direct or gives us what we want a little much but it felt thoroughly earned. Hannah is one of those films that feels like a great short story as many of Allen’s do. We jump from character to character and jump through time all to give us such a clear picture of these disparate but connected people. Rarely does life take us where we want it but it’s a longer journey than we give it credit for sometimes and even by the most circuitous routes we can find what we wanted all along. Some of that sounds a bit airy but I found it well earned. It’s like Sullivan’s travels but about how we approach the world rather than filmmaking.   Day of Wrath Directed by Carl Theador Dreyer (1943)- Without much delay we find ourselves following a woman accused of witchcraft in the 1600s who seeks the aid of someone whose mother she helped. It’s a young woman whose mother unknown to most was a witch (or at least accused of being one) and she tries to help the fleeing older woman but is powerless to really do so. But in seeing this other woman’s complete lack of power and agency she finds her own. Even though she’s locked in to a marriage with a much older man without ever being asked if she wanted to she finds ways to work around her constraints. It’s an interesting drama about this woman’s slow reclaiming of power that is ultimately doomed by the society she lives in which will never allow it. There’s a great sense of the Roman Catholic Church looming (sometimes literally) over everything, a society so defined by one belief system. Until now I didn’t really know Dreyer was kind of the king of the tracking shot. There are so many interesting tracking shots, some classic lateral shots and others that twist in interesting ways. Oftentimes he creates these perfectly still compositions then moves us through the environment making it feel like a real place. As if he’s being honest that the drama is constructed but the world it exists in is not, it existed and in some ways still does. He knows just when to keep something still and let the movement of the characters complete the shot while other times he moves the camera to fit them and come to the concluding image. Day of Wrath didn’t affect me as much as The Passion of Joan of Arc nor did it have any stand out vibrant moments of imagination like Vampyr (even though as a whole I think that’s a weaker film) but it was still very good. Bergman with a more dextrous camera. Wish there were more exteriors as he captured them particularly beautiful. Though it’s fitting that they should offer the reprieve they do from the claustrophobic interiors as they’re often the settings for moments of wild abandon that are captured perfectly. Thoughtful and very pretty, but unfortunately comparable to a masterpiece (Passion) that it can't quite live up to. So far lesser Dreyer is still very far from even mediocre.   EDIT: Forgot to mention that Day of Wrath in a week where I saw Fury Road still had the most amazing stunt of the week. I watched it a couple of times after and paused and can't quite think how they did it unless I'm really underestimating the skills of their model-makers. Genuinely blew me away. In Fury Road as crazy as things are I'm aware of the strings cgi-d out and that there's not folk in cars that explode/crash, but this I genuinely couldn't see how they did it without really hurting someone even though I'm sure they didn't."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,lordhadri,2,Sun Jun 28 14:20:58 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, not everything about Sleepaway Camp is entertaining either. ;) That's how bad movies go.  As much as George Miller may seem 'unchained' I'm curious to see what these possible sequels end up being because this one just takes the genre-ness of The Road Warrior to its logical endpoint. But I more than half-expect the next one to get away with being another Beyond Thunderdome and it'll be interesting to see what that looks like. Not only is Fury Road an untoppable movie, going by his track record Miller will know this and won't repeat himself.   I think they're supposed to be Protestants in Day of Wrath? Dreyer makes these movies about self-repression, it doesn't look like a critique of external oppression such as Passion to me anyway. At first I didn't love Day of Wrath either but it's such an eerie, well-directed movie and you should ask King how he feels about it sometime. Also, Dreyer was like Miller in that he didn't like to repeat himself. Ordet is completely different from Day of Wrath and Passion too. I'm looking forward to seeing Vampyr this month."

I know what you mean. I really felt the fact that this had been gestating for years and been refined over and over again, unsure what the version of this will look like that doesn't have that time. Excited though.  Yes you're right of course. Certainly not as much a critique but I definitely saw it there. Even outside the earlier Passion-esque scenes it's the rigid belief systems that twist the nerves of the characters. Guilt hangs over half the characters due to these beliefs even when they're trying to be good. The last shot in particular as the shadow of the cross lingers underlined it. Outside the regular guilt for the lies or bad things they've done people are weighed down by an intense spiritual guilt too which allows things to go as bad as they do. She's living in a society where she could believe she's a witch and know she's doomed because of it removing all reason to live by societies laws, which in turn ruins her. Probably as a Bergman-head I'm looking for that stuff though, dat Scandinavian religiousness yo.   Vampyr's real cool, I think I like it more than Nosferatu but now I'm a little unsure as I've not seen it in ages and liked Nosferatu more on rewatch. It might have more creepy effects I enjoyed but isn't quite as propulsive."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,lordhadri,3,Sun Jun 28 17:16:20 2015 UTC,"I've said this before, but my criticism of Mad Max is that the sound mixing is hideous at times. During the 'Who Killed The World' scene with Nux being held out of the car, I could literally only hear the last 2 lines of that scene. Speaking to other people, this was not a problem exclusive to me or my cinema. Someone else commented that they had to turn down the engine noise at one point, and there was a lot of ADR done, so they knew it was a problem.  Also, Hardy slipped into a 'Locke' (Welsh) accent when attending to Furiosa at the end of the movie. It was a little jarring."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,The_Silver_Avenger,4,Sun Jun 28 14:48:00 2015 UTC,"Although there are certain points where I can't make out the dialogue, this is one of those cases where going in search of something wrong with a movie is unproductive. So dialogue can be hard to hear, but this is not a problem unique to Fury Road among blockbusters, nor is it a problem unique to this Mad Max movie. All four of them had that issue to an extent. So I have to point out that the soundscape of Fury Road is overall very good: great sound effects like the truck horn, understanding of the function of music, and most unusually for this sort of movie, creative use of silence. Watch that hand-to-hand fight scene again and tell me the sound mixing isn't great. Also, because George Miller understands cinematic directing, you simply don't need to hear all the dialogue to understand what's happening, meaning it's not as crippling an issue as it is for other movies. There's a reason Miller claimed there's going to be a silent black&white version of the movie...it will work as one."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,_alco_,2,Sun Jun 28 15:31:24 2015 UTC,"But that specific scene was a) an important moment in the character development of Nux (seeds of doubt were clearly being sown in his mind) and b) a rare moment where the world beyond the film is being talked about.  It genuinely felt like I had missed something important when I watched it. I've looked over the internet, and I have found no full transcript for that scene, so I can't even judge if what I had missed was important.  It is odd, because like you said, the mixing is good in other areas. In the war rig when Max and Furiosa are having conversations, I could hear everything which was being said. Which means that it was either a) a mistake or b) a choice to specifically do the scene like that. I disagreed when Nolan said he specifically chose to make some of the dialogue in Interstellar inaudible and I disagree if Miller chose to make the scene inaudible too.  Sure, you don't need to hear all the dialogue to understand the movie, but I feel that it would have enhanced my viewing if I had heard it all."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,lordhadri,2,Sun Jun 28 17:30:31 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree about that scene. I saw the movie three times and still don't know exactly what was said. Hoult and Huntington-Whiteley don't shout the lines cleanly. I think that hurts our understanding of Angharad's character too. Even so, what has happened in that interaction is clear anyway. It's not like what Nolan does where he might have devoted less of the movie to dialogue in the first place where that would have gotten in the way of the rest of the sounds of the movie.   The dynamic between Max and Furiosa develops in a few short exchanges, but it's not like we're gonna understand what it is by just reading the words they say in the screenplay. We can't have it both ways either, I remember how YMS thought he should complain that the engine noise is dialed back too. Why does it matter? We might as well complain about every movie that uses non-diagetic music. (Virtually all of them.)"
TrueFilm,3bejg2,_alco_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:52:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I mean, that scene (and a few other isolated sound incidents) was the only real complaint that I had about the movie. It's not like American Hustle, where the words spoken were vital to the plot, but so many people were mumbling. I was exhausted by the end of Fury Road, but I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing.  But everything else I really liked. The best thing was the world-building based on visual cues and actions. The way they built the religion as a mixture of Norse mythology and car things (for want of a better word) was brilliant."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,yellow_sub66,0,Sun Jun 28 19:18:59 2015 UTC,"I disliked mad max because it had some obvious, glaring (in my opinion) errors in how it was shot. One of the biggest thorns being the fade/blackouts. They were used too often and at weird times when not only was it unnecessary but also didn't really fit. It distracted from the rest of the movie."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,crichmond77,6,Sun Jun 28 16:46:44 2015 UTC,"Those aren't errors, just an unfashionable way of doing scene transitions and eliding time. (And I loved that the movie just doesn't care about what is or isn't fashionable these days.) It's not like they're erratically placed, they always signal act breaks."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,Inception_025,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:21:44 2015 UTC,"I mean of course they aren't errors, but I remember watching a movie a long time ago (can't remember the title) that used the fade blackouts so frequently that it made the movie feel as if it was a bunch of TV show episodes just stiched together. Perhaps my only pervious experience with them being negative influenced the way I saw them in this movie, but I still feel as if those transitions could have been handled better, regardless of what is or isn't currently fashionable."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,LuigiVanPeebles,3,Mon Jun 29 01:41:47 2015 UTC,Honestly didn't notice them to the extent that it would bother me. Whenever I did notice it seemed like the breaths between relentless carnage and felt right. Things are so non stop for these people yet the film doesn't want to doddle so to get across and shorten their reprieves that way worked for me. Similarly to the sped up moments it felt like another way that Miller knew exactly what was important to linger on and what to get across succinctly.
TrueFilm,3bejg2,pursehook,7,Sun Jun 28 17:19:00 2015 UTC,"Queen (2014) dir.Vikas Bahl A pretentious, pseudo-progressive disaster is how I would describe this recent Bollywood film, hailed by many as a step forward for Indian popular film is a testament to the sorry state of the biggest film industry on the planet that this racist, sexist, close-minded film is seen as an advance.    A Lewis Carrol like story of a jilted fiancee from India who decides to take her honeymoon on her own, much to the dismay of her traditional family. In a film that sees itself as so forward thinking and liberal it sure heaps a lot of racial stereotypes onto the screen in what becomes the only funny thing about this 'comedy' film. The Italian chef who is mad about his food and says 'mamma-mia' a lot, the Russian who likes to drink, the overly sexualised and fashion conscious french woman, even the female protagonist, in a film that tries so hard to break away from the ideas of its own culture, has to be studying home keeping and cookery. It's like they thought""oh we've got her going to college, that's enough progression for us, she can still only function as a housewife"". The problems don't end there, the film is naive in its portrayal of prostitution among many other things and it feels as if the writer did not leave his home in India to see the rest of the world he was supposed to be writing about.  The plot is riddled with clichés and overly melodramatic (to the point of comedic) moments (to name one: the revelation as to why the three boys were there). In an attempt to appeal to both liberal audiences and the typical Bollywood mainstream ones, the film becomes extremely overly long and boringly predictable as out of place musical sequences are disappointingly yet expectedly slotted into their usual places while it sadly uses tired hackneyed traits of both American and Indian romantic comedies. In another bizarre move from the writers, the journey of the protagonist seems to finish and then immediately start over (as she moves from Paris to Amsterdam) - which adds to the length and simply annoys the watcher as it feels superfluous and unnecessary. The dialogue is terrible and feels unnatural, the writers even have the (purposeful) excuse of the broken English spoken by nearly all the characters however it still feels unrealistic and forced, just like the message of the film which is rendered non-existent by the film's own political and filmic attributes.  The direction is bland and forgettable, often over directed as a way to try and appear better than it is. This is honestly quite a hefty feat as the film opens in India - a place full of colour, especially at a wedding. The acting is largely terrible (probably in part due to the script and maybe what could have been badly translated subtitles) and each scene wanders somnolently into the next without force or power.   Bahl tries to escape the bounds of traditional modern Bollywood but ends up with a film much worse than even a standard affair by pretending to be many things but fails in even being average. Terrible. 1/10  The Tree of Life (2011) dir.Terrence Malick Brilliant, yet hard to write about. A film without traditional narrative yet portrays succinctly what it is to grow up and the effect of your parents. Never have I seen birth, life or death shown like this on film or to this degree of detail and thoughtfulness. Malick ponders how we should live our life and the tininess of it, compared to the magnitude of creation and destruction  through juxtaposition. Transfixing visually and emotionally moving, I feel it may take more watches to really understand exactly what he exactly wanted to say. The acting was amazing, especially from all of the child actors, who displayed complex emotion subtly and to great effect. 9.5/10  In Bruges (2008) dir.Martin McDonagh Finally got around to this /r/movies gem. They were right, I loved Seven Psychopaths and this was even better: funny, self aware, complex, moving and funny. Colin Farrell superbly portrays his assassin character and the emotions felt by him. It was also wonderfully directed. There isn't much more to say as this film has been talked to death, if you haven't seen it, do. 9/10    letterboxd, x-post r/flicks"
TrueFilm,3bejg2,LuigiVanPeebles,2,Sun Jun 28 18:19:07 2015 UTC,Just wait until you watch In Bruges again. It gets better each time I see it because there are so many callbacks and it's tied together so nicely.
TrueFilm,3bejg2,montypython22,5,Tue Jun 30 19:04:04 2015 UTC,"rewatch - Life of Pi directed by Ang Lee (2012) ★★★1/2  Life of Pi takes what I found to be a boring, overblown book and turns it into a visual feast. Visually this film does almost everything right (other than a few questionable transitions), it looks amazing and is a testament to how far technology has taken us. The tiger is photorealistic, never once did I feel like it was a CGI tiger, it always looks real. I know that occasionally they did use a real tiger, and the real sign that the CGI was done well is the fact that if you asked me to point out the times when the tiger is and is not real, I would not be able to tell you. I’m also glad I watched this again because I got to see it in 3D this time! It adds so much to the film, and other than one scene in which fish fly out at you, it adds to the film because it isn’t flashy at all. It adds depth to frames instead of finding opportunities to throw things at your face. The restraint here shows how good Ang Lee’s instincts are. I also noticed how good the script is here. It cuts out 90% of what is the first 130 long boring and unnecessary pages in the book and reduces it to 20 or 30 minutes, then it spends the remainder of the time on what we really wanted to see. It also does a great job at keeping us captivated with two characters, and one of those characters not being able to talk. With minimal dialogue, it does wonders. I liked this so much more this time, and I’m glad I watched it again. It really is a visual marvel (although I’m still a little bitter over its cinematography win over Skyfall or Django Unchained and moreso The Master or Samsara, which weren’t even nominated.)  Monsters University directed by Dan Scanlon (2013) ★★★  Monsters University was pretty much exactly the film I expected it to be, but still a little bit less than I hoped it would be. Monsters Inc has been my favorite Pixar movie since I first saw it at 5 years old, so naturally I love these characters and I love the world they inhabit. Seeing the characters again in a new story with all the references and subtle nods to the original movie was definitely one of my favorite parts of this movie. It doesn’t disappoint in that way, and it delivers what you expect to see in a Monsters Inc prequel, minus some of the intelligence and heart of the original. It may be a little dumb at times, and a little bit forced at others. It moves from plot point to plot point in order to hit jokes that it wants to use. The jokes come first in this movie, before the heart, before the themes. The story happens the way it does because of the jokes that were written, the jokes don’t happen because of the story. Again, I did enjoy myself in this movie, I thought it was beautifully animated and really funny. But it was missing some of the things that make Pixar’s best stand above the rest. Still, even the lesser Pixar movies are better than most others in the game.  Albert Nobbs directed by Rodrigo Garcia (2011) ★★  Albert Nobbs is a cross-dressing period drama that borrows from Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night and makes it dark and quite depressing. The titular character works at a hotel, pretending to be a man in order to get work. She meets another man who is secretly a woman, who has managed to lead a normal life with a wife, and Albert is inspired to try to do the same. There’s not much more to it than that, and though the writers and filmmakers had good intentions, they didn’t shine through as much as they could have. They took more risks than most period pictures ever do, which I admired, but it still felt like a bit of a jumbled mess in the end. The performances were the strongest point of the film by far, Mia Wasikowska gives one of her best performances that I’ve seen, and Janet McTeer and Glenn Close were also excellent. Not a great movie, but it had ambition.  rewatch - Blade Runner directed by Ridley Scott (1982) ★★★★  After reading Lordhadri’s review of Blade Runner in last week’s WHYBW thread, I felt that I needed to go back and reevaluate what I’ve come to think of as a sci-fi masterpiece. On my first viewing of Blade Runner I hated it, second viewing I loved it, and after my third, I still love it. It may think it’s saying a lot more than it actually is, and it may feel a little choppy in its editing at times (I’m looking at you first scene where the replicant shoots the blade runner), but it’s such an entertaining time and such a visual marvel that I can forgive it for its few faults. The good by far outweighs the bad. Ridley Scott is a visual director and he creates a very slick looking science fiction film noir world, a dystopia in which everyone has left the Earth and only the bottoms of society remain. I love the visuals in this movie, close ups are always clouded in cigarette smoke, light always reflects just the right way off of the eyes of replicants to make them look inhuman, the dark atmosphere gives it a very unique feel that pretty much every “gritty” sci-fi has borrowed from. The music, which bothered me on my first watch, is now one of my favorite parts of the movie. I’m definitely one of Blade Runner’s passionate supporters. It is one of my favorite sci-fi movies, and a thriller that gets my heart racing without fail.  Searching for Sugar Man directed by Malik Bendjelloul (2012) ★★★★  Searching for Sugar Man is just an incredible story. A Detroit songwriter whose producers thought of him as one of the best in the game who just never made it. Yet his music became a sensation in one country. After watching this movie I went and listened to Rodriguez’s “Cold Fact”, and it really is just as good, or even better than any of my other favorite albums from that era. I honestly can not see why Rodriguez did not succeed, he’s fantastic, and how the documentary explores that is exceptional. It doesn’t give us any absolute answers, because really it is impossible to say why this artist did not succeed, but it puts forth thought provoking arguments as to why it may have been. It also just makes you think about how many artists you would love out there that you have never heard of.  Film of the Week - Blade Runner"
TrueFilm,3bejg2,Digitalis2512,5,Sun Jun 28 20:16:13 2015 UTC,"Equus (1977): Jesus, what a handful. This is Sidney Lumet's adaptation of Peter Shaffer's play by the same name (Shaffer also adapted the screenplay). Martin Dysart (Richard Burton) is a state psychiatrist who is suffering from the world's meanest case of the Mondays when he takes on a new patient, a young man who has been arrested for gouging the eyes of six horses. Mental illness, isolation, religious fanaticism, and sexual repression let the boy think horses are Jesus. Mid-life crisis, delusions of grandeur, and emotional impotence let Dysart think he is a horse.  Never before has a film so immediately captured my attention and imagination as the first minute of Equus' opening monologue. And, never before has a film so immediately negated that imagination as the following minute. The film's structure, and reliance on monologue to outline its insights, is its downfall. The psychiatrist/patient relationship lends itself to verbalizing the mental conundrums it explores to a painful degree. This is a shame, because its imagery is so evocative, and so successful at leading your mind down unexplored paths that twist your gut and sting your eyes. But, every successful scene is immediately followed by it's own autopsy. Every insight gained is explicated. The screenplay badly undercuts the potential of Lumet's direction, and the strength of Burton's performance.  The Overnight (2015): Director Patrick Brice delights in placing his hand slightly too high on your knee, and then inching his pinky finger slowly upward. His first film, Creep (2014), was more blunt with its approach, and sinister with its intentions to wear down its victim's boundaries. With his second film, The Overnight, Brice explores similar themes but has had more time to hone his art of manipulation, with sweeter results.  The story is framed around a small dinner party between two couples who have just met, one of which has plans for things going a little further than they first let on. Brice has tightened up his writing since Creep, and the story's four leads provide much more potential for interplay than Creep's two. For a dialogue-oriented movie set 90% within one (albeit large) house, Brice keeps the dynamics churning. Kurt's (Jason Schwatrzman) nonchalant licentiousness escalates the night's debauchery, but the plausibility is kept grounded by Emily's (Taylor Schilling) mortified reaction shots. It's that balance that makes the story work, and fuels the effective comedy throughout the movie. This is a movie about pushing people way outside of their comfort zones, and it's going to have that effect on its audience, as well. If you're game, then the payoff is great, but a few people walked out of the screening I saw, and several more seemed to refuse to play along.  Long Weekend (1978): This story follows Peter and Marcia, a pair of assholes who have decided that a weekend camping on the Australian coast will help ease the tension in their unhappy relationship. After setting up camp they rest and recharge by bickering, littering, stealing eggs, hacking at trees, and firing a rifle indiscriminately into the woods and ocean. The local wildlife is understandably put off by this behavior, and seeks its revenge.  With all of Australia's deadly fauna, you can imagine the kind of ferocious creatures the story will throw at them, and you're right... it's a dugong, a possum, and some birds. That's the movie's charm, though. It's not so savage as to make you watch them swell to death from snake bites, or be ripped open by crocodiles, and it doesn't play to arachnophobic fears. Instead it pecks, scratches, and infuriates them into submission, and helps them take out their aggressions on each other. Unfortunately, the characters' caustic attitudes grate after a while, even if they are getting their comeuppance, and an abortion subplot lends some unwelcome weight to nature's judgment.  Body Count (1987): A bad day making movies must still be a good day. 80 bad days making movies must be Body Count.  A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014): A black and white vampire romance, shot in California, dialogue in Farsi, set in the fictional location of Bad City.I'm not sure why director Ana Lily Amirpour decided to shoot in black and white, but it was a good choice as the images are the most striking thing about this movie. A white, moon-lit wall with a petite hijab-wearing vampire scooting along on a skateboard is pretty. Beyond that, I was reaching to find the overarching thread in the narrative. Drug abuse, mistreatment of women, and recurring shots of oil pump jacks created a theme of exploitation (or predation), but I'm not sure if I see that followed through in the romance story between the two leads. I might need some more time to digest this one.  I did have a chance to hear Amirpour do a Q&A after the screening I attended. One thing I thought was particularly interesting was her description of a scene where the two leads are first alone together, and slowly close the distance between one another. She referred to that space as the third character in the room, and it really stole the show. That was one of the movie's more effective moments."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,eliphas_levi,3,Sun Jun 28 15:15:21 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad that someone has seen Equus so I can comment.  Quite a while back, there was a thread that was something like... what's a bad/unsuccessful movie that is worth seeing and why.  Obviously, the correct answer is Equus, but sadly I was not upvoted.  First of all, if there is a play revival near you (unlikely), go see that rather than the movie.     I believe it was revived in London a few years ago.  The play was a Broadway sensation in the 70s.  The film is a perfect example of difficulties in transforming certain material from theater to film.  Just for that, it is useful for learning.  But, this goes far beyond just too much talking in a room (like say Sleuth, while a very enjoyable play turned film).  Equus takes some elements that are used symbolically in the play and then visualizes certain actions, sometimes horrors, on the screen, which would have been left to the imagination in a theater.  Yikes!  And, when this doesn't work well, it doesn't in the extreme.  All that said, Equus is well worth seeing even just for Peter Firth's and Richard Burton's acting.  (Firth had been in the long running Broadway play, so he has this f**ked up teen nailed.)  This is late Burton and with his famous, self-destructive alcoholism, I expected to be disappointed.  Instead, I thought his performance was amazing. And, Firth... I'm not sure that I've seen anything quite like that performance since."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,jburd22,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:46:29 2015 UTC,"I am curious about the play. I'm wondering how the horses being played by men might add a more homosexual subtext, and what that does with the whole Jesus salvation thing."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,sg587565,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:29:48 2015 UTC,"(like say Sleuth, while a very enjoyable play turned film)   I adore this film. When I first saw it, I didn't see the main twists coming at ALL. I was floored. It shouldn't work, but it does.  On that note, I think it's interesting to note that Tony Schaffer (who wrote Sleuth) is the twin brother of Peter Schaffer (who wrote Equus and Amadeus, among other greats). How's that for a Rochefort-ian twist?  On Equus, I had the chance to see it off-Broadway a couple years back. Interesting play, don't know if I should check out the film version. It seems like a perfect melting-pot of people: Sidney Lumet directs (the mods can yell at me all they want, but I fuckin' love his film-version of 12 Angry Men, I think he and Peter Finch are the reasons why Network works, and Dog Day Afternoon is a 70s classic too-little-discussed today), Dick Burton stars, Colin Blakely features."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,jburd22,3,Mon Jun 29 02:49:26 2015 UTC,"Millennium Actress - Although I liked this movie, sometimes it felt like I shouldn't be, as if I were just being sympathetic due to it being a Kon movie. A simple, sentimental story, well made and polished, but a little forgettable.  Ran - I saw an interview with Sidney Lumet where he said Ran and Rashomon were two takes on the same theme, with this in mind I agree with him that Ran was superior. The characters felt more mature and human, and rather than replaying the same event to emphasise the theme, the movie just played it out. Somehow I feel like Mifune couldn't have been in this movie.  I have no idea what to watch next. Tokyo Story is long overdue, but I'm also considering Three Colours: Blue, M, Run Lola Run, the first Mad Max, a rewatch of The Wind Rises, and about a dozen Kurosawa movies."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,TrumanB-12,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:12:18 2015 UTC,"Tokyo Story if you've never seen an Ozu film, otherwise go for M is what I'd say!"
TrueFilm,3bejg2,4arc,4,Sun Jun 28 19:49:32 2015 UTC,"Over the last 2 weeks I have seen four films, and all of them were great in some capacity. This is only my second time doing this (first time was 2 weeks ago) so I'm grouping together my 2 weeks since last week I wasn't able to see many films. If you have seen the films I'm going to talk about and would like to discuss them, feel free to comment, besides I will probably have more to say. Also I'm looking for films to watch so if you recommend any to me I will be glad to watch them. I will certainly talk about them next week.   Raging Bull 1980 (Martin Scorsese): Like many others on this sub, or most, or all, I am a massive Scorsese fan. Despite this I haven't seen all of his films and I'm embarrassed to say this is one of them (so is Cape Fear and the King of Comedy and The Last Temptation of Christ but I swear I'm on it).  I forget where I saw this, but I remember their being an article on how Raging Bull was voted by modern editors as being the best edited film of all time. Now could this film achieve that? The thing I love the most about Scorsese is how honest of a film maker he is. Regardless of the subject matter or context, he always approaches his characters with respect. Robert DeNiro's performance is nothing short of spectacular. It is so nuanced and subtle that DeNiro is completely lost in the role. I love Taxi Driver and The Godfather 2, but this is without a doubt his best performance. I also love how the film handles the character. We never really get inside the characters head and more experience him from afar. I love that the film never tries to justify his character, it just shows him how he is. With most scenes being distant and awkward in their presentation, this allows the boxing scenes to really shine. They come with such power and kineticism that they are easily the most visceral and enjoyable part of the film. It's kind of like Jurassic Park, where how one aspect of the film that takes up a fraction of the film easily becomes the highlight. It's in the presentation though that these moments shine. Because this film is so reserved in other places, the boxing scenes can really deliver a hell of a punch. And yes they are expertly edited. I can EASILY recommend this to everyone here, and if you have already seen it, then maybe it's time for a rewatch.  Inside Out 2015(Pete Docter): Oh Pixar have I missed you. In short this film is amazing. It's one of the most inventive films this year and is easily on the best animated films I've ever seen. In fact it might even be my favourite film of the year alongside Mad Max and Ex Machina. I remember Adam from YMS' big criticism of PIXAR films is that they are just good kids films, but not good films, and that just being a good kids film does not warrant it the acclaim it has received. Well I completely disagree with that statement and I actually think that this being a great kids film (while being an excellent film in its own right) is what makes this film so special. What is so beautiful about Inside Out is that it has now created a whole new toolbox that parents and their kids can share when they talk about emotions. How this film deals with concepts like core memories, abstract thought and depression is nothing short of amazing and is so easily accessible for kids to understand. Not all kids will love this movie, but I guarantee that a lot will reflect upon it as they get older and can use it as a frame of reference for their lives. To me this is the beauty of Pixar, how it can entertain, and teach a great lesson. I rarely cry in movies, but for Inside Out I cried 3 times, each time more than the next. The ending of this film is such a gut-punch of emotion, and I swear there wasn't a dry eye in the theatre. In an age where blockbuster films are becoming increasingly lacking in emotion, it's great to see a film that's main goal is to give you a lesson and make you feel something. An emotional connection is the most important factor of any form of storytelling, and Pixar certainly proved it. Go see this.   Black Swan 2010(Darren Aronofsky): If you've made it this far, you've heard me gush over the last two films. So you will understand the weight when I say that this is the best film I've seen this week. This is without a doubt a masterpeice. Everything in this film works and is in sync with one another. The performances (particularly Natalie Portman)? Amazing. Score? ditto. Directing? Flawless. This is a director who has mastered his craft and is using all of his bells and whistles to maximum effect. Granted there isn't too much deep with the film, but as a cinematic experience this is nothing short of amazing. Sorry ""the Fly"", to me this is the new gold standard of bodily horror. I have this philosophy for films: the less you have to say about a film after you see it, the better it is. So what were my thoughts after seeing it? well, Natalie Portman said it best. ""It was Perfect"".   I was going to talk about Foxcatcher last, but after typing this long I'm kind of done. All I will say is that it's good not great, Mark Ruffalo is terrific, and that it is refreshing to see a film recently that takes its time. If the trailer interested you I recommend you see it. But Make sure to do research on it afterwards (though I always do this for every ""based on a true story"" film I see).  Note: If you are wondering why I haven't given any scores it is because I fundamentally disagree with that concept. I just simply can't quantifiably organizing films."

Darren Aronofsky is a true mastermind and I highly recommend his ""Requiem for a Dream"" as a similarly, exceptional, dark follow up. ""The Wrestler"" and ""The Fountain"" are both equally interesting, the former in a lighter light while the latter in a more experimental, dreamy realm. Please, talk."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,crichmond77,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:34:37 2015 UTC,"yes, let's.   The one thing I really loved about it was its portrayal of the arts. I was an actor in Musicals during Highschool and have been doing plays and acting in shortfilms during my current Uni Experience. The one thing I love was how it handled the technicalities, how making all of the perfect moves doesn't mean a damn thing if you don't have the grace/free spirit. To me this conflict was very relate-able as I've worked with many actors who have faced this conflict; they get too focused on getting the lines down or the moves right when they aren't spending the right amount of time working on their character. As a fan of the arts I've always loved films that properly explore talent and the creative process.  Last year my favourite film was without a doubt Whiplash, and I loved how that film explores the thrive for perfection. In a way that and Black Swan are the same movie (though Whiplash is far more about the mentor/student relationship). They both explore the deterioration of the person as they thrive for this. Where Whiplash shows the deterioration from a social standpoint, BS uses physical and mental deterioration. Those scenes of bodily and psychological horror are so affecting and terrifying. Like the scenes with the fingernail, or Beth and the knife, my god.  I don't know if I said this in my little review, but man everyone in the film was on point. All of the performances are sort of hyper-real and are on the brink of characiture but the film makes sure they never cross that line. The film never lets go of its unrelenting tension and you really get the sense that every scene builds upon the last. I love films that explore descents into madness and this has to be a new favourite.   Other Highlights: Mila Kunis is amazing in this, love the meta use of the swan lake plot narrative (keeps things nice and simple allowing us to focus on other things), cinematography was amazing, especially the use of mirrors and eliminating the camera. I probably have other things to say but I've forgotten a lot of them. I'd love to hear what you have to say, it's your favourite movie so you must have a lot to add."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,cattymills,2,Mon Jul 6 03:24:07 2015 UTC,"Still a little sour you claimed Black Swan ""isn't too much deep,"" I can see why'd you'd think that as you're seemingly fixated on the physical and mental deterioration of Nina (the name literally meaning ""child"") and less, but I'd argue more important to the deeper value of the film, her social development. Let's lay the groundwork for who Nina is:   professionally a ballerina still living with her ex-ballerina mom a ""sweet girl"" quiet and reserved from her colleagues (shots of her literally at opposite ends of the hallway) but at the time of her introduction, not unliked fastidious and technically proficient but hasn't had a large role in any production   These quick bullets don't answer a lot of questions. The big one for me is how old is she? She drinks at the club, so supposedly past 21, but take one look at the decor of her room and you'd think she was five (butterfly, pink walls, white sheets, stuffed animals, music box etc). We actually witness her throw out her stuffed animals, which most have probably packed up by their teens out of embarrassment [when they bring people over] or maturation! We're getting ahead of ourselves... but you get it, socially, she's years behind. Her best friend is her mom a la ""my sweet girl"" reinforced by only the two of them celebrating her announcement (frosting-covered cake scene - which, and keep this in mind for later, rejecting sugar, synonymous with pleasurable desires). Rather than argue like most adults, when she asks Thomas if she can have the main swan part and he says no, she doesn't fight him but says, ""I'm sorry"" and then turns to walk away. Typical shy girl stuff. Blame her stunted growth, in a she-only-knows-ballet and nothing else kinda way, with some combination of dance consuming her life and her mom's sheltering. Hell, half of their apartment is dedicated to ballet.   And let's move forward some; it's impossible to tell whether she was lying or not, but did you believe her when she said she wasn't a virgin? I didn't. That all was the set up for this gentle, sweet white swan we're first introduced to. By the end, she's fully transformed into the essence of the black swan: biting Thomas' in their kiss scene, masturbating, sex, blocking out her mother etc and otherwise becoming passionate, assertive and aggressive about things. My favorite, and it's subtle, is during the showing, when she falls, she runs wildly to Thomas and starts blaming the guy who was holding her up despite it clearly being her fault. Before, she would have timidly said, ""I'm sorry."" Thus, Black Swan is a dark coming of age movie for girls: a desertion of their sweetness and innocence for the sensual and adult.  Technically, this film is masterful. The attention to detail is endless in editing and staging, just look through these stills which highlight the after effects to get under your skin. I absolutely adored the way Aronofsky played with using Natalie Portman (white swan) and Mila Kunis (black swan) to be the ""same person"". And you've got it, any mirror scene - amazing. The sound effects were absolutely chilling and hollowing, particularly the rash/ mirror scenes; really... rustled my feathers. I'm also fond of how you hear Nina gasping for air each turn and everyone's feet hitting the floor. The soundtrack was exceptional, the lightness of it made the film all the more unsettling. And there wasn't any fat left - every scene was deliberate.  I ultimately preferred Black Swan's ""prequel"", The Wrestler to Whiplash but neither came close to touching Black Swan. It was brassy-beautiful, I get it but it had a hard time holding my attention. I suppose I had a hard time sympathizing with the character. He chases perfection with an acute rigor whereas Nina needs to let go. One is more consuming and gripping in my opinion. Black Swan is art."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,Smells_Like_Victory,9,Thu Jul 9 13:53:33 2015 UTC,"Jurassic World (Trevorrow, 2015)—This was a pretty weak effort, I thought. Felt like all of the jump scenes had just been copied verbatim from the original, and to be honest I wasn't all that impressed by the huge dinosaur they genetically engineered. Coupled with some weak performances (Vincent D'Onofrio, what were you doing?) and a screenplay that appears to be a mosaic of ten scripts penned during the last 15 years of development hell, this is not a great ride. 3/10  Enough Said (Holofcener, 2013)—I'm a big fan of Gandolfini and JLD but I thought the script was sort of mediocre. Typical indie film fare, I suppose, but this didn't do anything for me. 5/10  The Babadook (Kent, 2014)—I don't watch much horror, so I could be off base here, but I found this to be a well-made film with good performances and some genuinely scary bits. However, it had a big third-act problem; I didn't really buy the transformation from mousy single parent into knife-wielding maniac. 7/10  eXistenZ (Cronenberg, 1999)—Cronenberg's earlier (pre-Spider) works have always interested me for their body horror vibes and their oddly prescient visions of the modern world. eXistenZ is no exception with its engrossing plot and subtext worth considering. It's not as good as Videodrome but then again, is anything? 8/10  Irréversible (Noé, 2002)—Having been ""spoiled"" several years ago, I knew exactly how the film would progress before I began. That didn't detract from the visceral experience, however. At first I was put off by what I felt to be von Trier-level brash showiness in the Rectum club, but as the film progressed I began to understand what Noé was trying to show. I think films like this (I include some of Haneke's films here too) help us reconsider violence and violent sex in ways that are ultimately healthy. However, I also agree with some of Senses of Cinema's criticisms in that the film seems to present a highly reactionary view of dominant-submissive/male-female sexuality. 8/10, although I don't think I'll watch another Noé film.  Mad Max: Fury Road (Miller, 2015)—Maybe it's because I watched it right after Irréversible, but this didn't quite impress me as much as I had hoped based on the trailer. The action was great and the chases were impeccably choreographed, shot, and put together. However, I found the flourishes, like the guitar-shredding dude, cool but occasionally too (not sure if this is quite the right word, but) baroque. I admit that I am totally unfamiliar with the Mad Max films, but this has made me curious to check out the others. 7/10"
TrueFilm,3bejg2,cattymills,4,Sun Jun 28 16:12:48 2015 UTC,"I want to convince you to see more Noe. Irreversible is one of my favourite movies of all time but I want you to stick with him to at least watch Enter the Void.  Enter the Void is one of the most unique pieces of film of the previous decade. I wrote up a whole review of it either the previous week or the one before that. Simply put, it's the movie that comes the closest to represent LSD in a film like setting. Just grab something to drink, relax, ignore the bad acting  (all are amateurs) and enjoy the most visually spectacular and psychedelic movie ever made.  Then again I really like Noe and his almost exploitative style so I may be in the minority. I don't really care about morals in film so I'll like a movie even if it disagrees with my own views."

It's very visually interesting, but I've never had a trip that resembled much of anything in the film.  I also think it gets a little too gimmicky (an opinion I hold to a lesser extent with Irreversible) for its own good, detracting form an otherwise fascinating story and main character."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,lordhadri,6,Tue Jun 30 19:07:22 2015 UTC,"Before I start this, I have to ask: does anyone knows a site where you can easily browse the films available on streaming sites more easily and more intuitively?   Jaws (1975) directed by Steven Spielberg  Finally saw this, and while I won't say I was disappointed because I did enjoy it -- I guess I didn't like it as much as most people.  First, some positives. In terms of presentation, this is really well directed. Everyone rightfully knows about the shark scenes, but Spielberg puts thought into every scene, and stages the normal conversational ones in deft, interesting ways, not falling back to lazy cutting, and he captures colorful characters. And, those shark scenes are incredible. The POV followed by claustrophobic shits shots with John William's iconic score; the obvious, terrific threat of the shark; and the universal vulnerability-inducing quality of open water add up to something sublimely terrifying.   My first criticism is that we don't get enough of those scenes. A lot of people praised Spielberg for his restraint in this, and while his restraint within the shark scenes is commendable, the restraint in the actual number of them isn't. Obviously, if the film was solely comprised of them it wouldn't work, but as it stands the film's out of balance. I know I just said that Spielberg makes the non-shark scenes interesting and that the characters are colorful, and he does and they are, but it's not interesting enough to carry the film for long stretches like they're asked to.  Secondly, and I guess this is kind-of reflected in the first criticism, is that there are some pretty major tonal imbalances in this film. The film's mostly witty, light-hearted action-adventure and with some horror and the discordance is occasionally jarring. For example, John Williams da-nan score is arguably what people most remember about the film, but it's not heard very often -- instead something very poor, very forgettable, very lighthearted is mostly heard on the soundtrack. But, perhaps the most notable example of this is the shark hunter, Quint. The character is the most action-adventure, goofy thing in the film, yet is killed in what is by far the most horrific film in the film, and then promptly avenged through the killing of the shark in a action-adventure-y way. It feels completely wrong.   But, if the union between the action-adventure and horror elements is uneasy I can at least say that both individually are undoubtedly at the very least well-made, and while Jaws isn't quite as fun as I expected, due to the formidableness of its horror bits it is memorable.  ★★★  The Man with the Golden Arm (1955) directed by Otto Preminger  In Andrew Sarris' entry on Otto Preminger in The American Cinema, there's a bit on how Preminger ""does not entirely transcend his material;"" The Man with the Golden Arm* seems to be the perfect example of this. The script is mostly an incredibly rote, by-the-book tale of drug addiction and coming clean. Preminger, with help from an excellent Jazz-y score and a similar great performance from Frank Sinatra, transforms this into something incredible. It's gripping and filled with some moments of beauty. It had me desperately rooting for Sinatra's recovering drug addict. It had me utterly in its throes. It's a directorial tour-de-force. Seriously, I was going to give it five stars. But, the script sticks to the cliches too much to the point of extreme annoyance. Eventually, even Preminger & co. can't overwhelm this. And even when the script gets itself vaguely back on track, wisely ditching lazy cynicism, it does so in a melodramatic and painfully contrived manner, stuffed with conflict for the sake of conflict. It drags down the film to the point where a magnificent closing shot from Preminger can only do so much to make the redemption feel earned.  ★★★  T-Men (1947) directed by Anthony Mann  U.S. Treasury sponsored film noir. Sounds great, and the chances for subversion are glorious (and realized), but it didn't really click for me.  Under the Skin (2013) directed by Jonathan Glazer  For all the talk of the visual beauty of Under the Skin, I found the images themselves to be underwhelming. Frankly, to me, they give off an almost schlocky, B-movie vibe, but that isn’t too much of an issue because the film isn’t interested in beauty and the appeal lies rather in how the images are constructed, put together.   The film establishes a routine. Scarlett Johansson’s character lures, seduces, and submerges men. It’s transfixing, I suppose, because of the alien perspective on the world established by the overwhelming silence, sparse score, and sheer weirdness of what we see on screen, as well as the obvious draw of erotic assassination.   But, incrementally at first and then exponentially, the routine changes. First, it’s merely—though significantly—more garments of clothing being shed during the drownings, then it’s pity being given, and so on. The disruption of the routine paired with the apparition of menacing, apparent pursuers transforms the film from transfixing to unsettling—frightening. From alien to something more human.  Likewise, subtextually, the film gradually shifts from what initially ostensibly appears to be a misogynistic point of view, with the predatory portrayal of female sexuality, to what could be a feminist view. Of course, the film’s to ambiguous for the previous sentence to be anything substantially more than theorizing.   That ambiguity is perhaps an almost necessary part of what made the film so entrancing, but ultimately I don’t think it serves it well. The film could be said to be about exploring ‘what makes us human,’ but it doesn’t expound on that for anything more than vague assumptions to be made about its intentions. Johansson’s character’s humanism grows incredibly, yet is still clinically observed and her death is accompanied by only the slightest pangs of melancholy.   Under the Skin got under my skin like few other, but there wasn’t quite enough for me to latch onto -- I'd call it great, but I wouldn't call it profound.  ★★★★  Nightcrawler (2014) directed by Dan Gilroy  I wasn't entirely sure how I felt about Under the Skin, but, when I saw Nightcrawler, it clicked for me.   Heading into this, I was expecting a satire on the news, which god knows we need nowadays. Nightcrawler isn't that -- while it does acknowledge the seediness very quickly, the film isn't interested in exploring that and its wider repercussions. Likewise, I read someone else say that it was about leadership and whether or not you have to be an asshole to succeed. And, kinda, but that's not a very interesting reading of the film considering that it repeatedly slams its point on that with little nuance and those moments are probably the worst in the film. So, no, I don't think Nightcrawler is really about those two things, so I don't think it really says anything of note.  But, you know what? That doesn't matter. At all. Beacause what we're left with is an incredibly paced screenplay and a sublime performance from Jake Gyllenhaal that kept me superglued to my seat, and whose escalations legitimately started getting to me. It's thrilling. The photography, super crisp with lots of neon lights, but over darkness, is a perfect marriage with the smarmy evil of Gyllenhaal's character. And the direction is pretty ordinary, not in a good way, but even Gilroy manages to adorn it with enough of these sort of quick, too smooth movements, both within the frame and by moving the frame, that the film manages to reach a cohesive, stylistic unity or rhythm.  I said that this helped me understand how I feel about Under the Skin, and, now, I'll talk about that. That film and this one are similar in that they both glued me to the seat, but also I wouldn't call either of them particularly profound. The difference between the two of them, I think, is the Gyllenhaal performance. It's something I can latch on to -- it's sticking with me. Nightcrawler may not be profound, but, unlike with Under the Skin, I don't care.  ★★★★1/2"

Ever since then he's been making movies that have at least one completely excessive scene in them. Of course, he's one of the best at it, and all his imitators never caught up.  I know what you mean about Under the Skin, it seemed like it became an art movie for people who don't watch art movies. That's not its fault. Maybe if it had embraced its B-movie origins I would have gotten more from it.  And now I'm dying to know what you'd think of Turkish Delight."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,lordhadri,2,Mon Jun 29 04:27:50 2015 UTC,"Ooh yeah, I completely forgot about the malfunctioning shark. A little surprising considering that almost everyone brings it up when talking about the movie. I think I see what you're saying about Spielberg being one of the best at doing excessive scenes. I think Jaws is pretty uneven throughout, but, goddamn, he can stage scenes really well. Obviously I need to see more of his, but I can already see why he's so adored and yet so polarizing.   You know, I've really been wanting to delve into Verhoeven's non-American work (and you're not making it easier), but unfortunately don't know if that'll happen anytime soon. They're not on any (legal) streaming sites that I know of, and my libraries have really shitty selections."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,CVance1,4,Mon Jun 29 06:34:27 2015 UTC,"Some scattered thoughts on some of the films I watched recently, no more, no less.  Magic Mike (Steven Soderbergh, 2012)  Soderbergh never figures out whether he wants to film concepts or people and does neither. It's a film without soul, without a moral backbone, it's an empty film. 50 shades of yellow too. 3/10.  Shooting Dogs aka Beyond the Gates (Michael Caton-Jones, 2005)  It's an interesting choice, to film this from a Western perspective. The more so when the end credits roll and the stories of Rwandans are printed on screen. I wonder, are what we seeing here Western actions or inactions or just, to use the now famous words of the UN lady, gestures meaning nothing even when they are combined? We must choose words carefully here.  I don't know if it's possible to have a moral judgment on the way this film is shot, from the perspective of young and old white people. Their stories deserved to be told, and I wouldn't want to be in the shoes of any of those men and women. On the other hand, is it their story?  Be that as it may, this film almost plays as a remake of Hotel Rwanda - and reminded me how good that film is, considering it's an Oscar movie about Africa. But then, one might argue, this tells a more realistic story, due to the tragic ending. Is that really true? I don't think so, as the film still ends with one of those gestures - the black girl saved by the white man, to teach the other white man how to live. 4/10.  The Crime of Monsieur Lange (Jean Renoir, 1936)  Renoir likes to films society (however it comes) and the people in it, but in this film both society and people are just not that interesting. Sure, Renoir will spice up any film with funny and profound moments, but the majority of this film zips along at too high a pace to ever be able to properly examine any human themes. Instead, Renoir focuses on the political platitudes of exploitative capitalism versus socialistic communities for a significant amount of time. Neither one really wins, as the film turns back towards Mr Lange, his boss and his lover just in time to make this a worthwhile experience after all. 7/10.  El Dorado (Howard Hawks, 1966)  Essentially a remake of Rio Bravo, but I like it more. The character John Wayne is playing is more complex here, reflecting on his age and the changing times. The film argues, correctly, that while the old type was going out of fashion, he/it wasn't any worse for it. John Wayne with one arm is still outplaying the new kids on the block.  Naturally the film is very Hawksian with economic professionalism, but did I spot an unusually flamboyant nod to one of his greatest admireres when the piano player was shot? 8/10."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,lordhadri,5,Sun Jun 28 14:55:24 2015 UTC,"As always, you can ask me for expanded thoughts.  Three Kings David O. Russell, 1999: ”I’m surrounded by a ring of Jesus Fire.” This feels like a prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road about the day jobs of the bad guys...ok, that’s an inane observation, but I wanted to say it anyway. I like how Russell finds a way to shoot combat without turning it into a video game, and his action technique here is a lot better than most directors of actual action movies. But he also has a very clever story here that shows us more sides of war than we usually get from American ‘war’ movies. It separates four not-too-bright Americans from their unbeatable army and puts them in an interesting dilemma between their greed (steal the gold!) and their heroic impulses (save the hostages!) to see if they can find their way to doing the right thing, with the twist that that Iraqis on both sides are indifferent to the American being around at all and trying to make it a story about themselves.  That’s a great way to make a war movie that’s anti-war and means it. This movie knows that the people who suffer the most from war often don’t wear the uniform of any army. (Including some oil slicked birds. sob) The Americans here are bored yokels looking for something to steal while trying to look good for the media and convince themselves they didn’t just fight a war to give rich Kuwaitis back their cell phones. One more reason I loved Three Kings is it has a way of reframing your perspective about whether George Bush’s role in war is very different from Saddam Hussein’s, and showing what the role of money is for people who don’t have very much of it. It has unexpected added value these days because it makes it pretty obvious why the 2003 Iraq War was inevitable.   The mantra these days is that Russell is trying too hard to be mainstream but I don’t see what’s so different between this movie and American Hustle?  Turkish Delight Paul Verhoeven, 1973: Starring Rutger Hauer and Rutger’s Hauer. I had seen most of Verhoeven’s American movies at some point but none of the Dutch ones. This sex comedy is way more awesome than it should have been. It’s like what I wish Punch-Drunk Love, A Clockwork Orange, and The Wolf of Wall Street had been all at the same time.  Inside Out Pete Docter, 2015: Letterboxd review here. I feel like too many movies have been set in San Francisco lately.  Three Ages Buster Keaton, 1923  The Hitch-Hiker Ida Lupino, 1953  Bicycle Thieves Vittorio de Sica, 1948: This is Neorealism I can get behind.  Mr. Arkadin Orson Welles, 1955: Welles was so different from everyone else, for better or worse.  Collateral Michael Mann, 2004: Mainly worth watching for the way Mann shoots Los Angeles, and performances by Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise. I love how this movie totally owns the silver fox version of Cruise though, it lets him be a character unique to the movie. Question: Is Vincent a nihilist? I couldn’t figure that out.  Rewatch - Drive Nicholas Winding Refn, 2011: I get why you all love it so much, but Collateral had a much more interesting story to tell within same the parameters of pretty-looking Los Angeles auto-assisted crime film. I rate them about the same.  Rewatch - The Thin Red Line Terrence Malick, 1998: This week’s ultra-long getting-it-over-with movie...although it went by quicker than most everything else, to be honest.   Lava James Ford Murphy, 2015: wtf?"

There's an exact moment where it stops being what it was and becomes something less interesting, and I can only assume that's the half Refn cares more about. It goes from a story about a potentially mentally atypical guy trying to find a family to an alpha male wish fulfillment fantasy and starts gruesomely annihilating all the interesting supporting characters. (And the wonderful actors playing them.) Refn is just as technically talented as the directors he's ripping off here like Michael Mann and Walter Hill, maybe even more, but unlike them manages to render the story less meaningful in the end. So that leaves me less impressed with how well a scene is lit or how great the soundtrack is."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,lordhadri,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:09:37 2015 UTC,I did actually wish there was a little more about The Driver doing his job interspersed with the neighborly scenes. It might've helped the changing feeling or given it a little bit of a jolt

TrueFilm,3bejg2,PantheraMontana,2,Mon Jun 29 01:06:28 2015 UTC,Nothing more to say about Thin Red Line?
TrueFilm,3bejg2,lordhadri,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:23:45 2015 UTC,"I think it feels like Malick's most 'normal' one, even more than Badlands. That's not a bad thing other than this time I still have reservations about Nick Nolte playing that General Ripper character too close to type.   All those crane shots through the tall grass give it a unique look for a war movie.   What you can't do is expect any of the internal monologue from the soldiers to seem like things they'd realistically be thinking. The movie knows why it's doing that so I think it's okay. However, you can tell that Malick really read the book and had probably talked to veterans in his life but had never seen a war himself, compared to a director like Sam Fuller. Again, I think it works if you accept that it's gonna be that way and that the movie knows it's an examination of conflict in nature and not trying to make any specific points about real historical events. I like that the battle scenes are terrible instead of cool yet it's still watchable cinema unlike the endless annihilation I went through recently during Heaven's Gate.  It also shows something about war that we don't often see depicted in movies: first it's a one-sided massacre of the Americans, then a one-sided massacre of the Japanese, with very little actual combat involved.   I can see why this movie must have knocked the wind out of everyone at the time and I do like it, but it's not my favorite movie about soldiers. Like so many other similar movies, it makes them anonymous. (Three Kings is a great example of a movie that portrays soldiers as individual characters in a totally different way.) I also think Malick has outgrown the need for these historical genre movies in order to say what he wants to say, so I like some of the others more."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,mawooooh,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:16:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Very well put. The Thin Red Line is my favorite war film and my favorite Malick piece, though I've yet to actually see that much of his (Tree of Life is the only other I think). The juxtaposition of nature's beauty with the carnage of Guadalcanal is sublime to me, and I think one of the strongest elements of the movie is that it conveys the idea that the acts of war being depicted are not separate from nature, but as inextricable from it as man himself. This is to say nothing of the fantastic score from Zimmer which really cements the film among my list of favorites."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,The_Silver_Avenger,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:46:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I should have mentioned, the way the movie cuts back and forth from the violence to Malick's usual natural light nature imagery gives it a unique feel, and is totally confident about how to do it. His editors have always done a terrific job and this would be their greatest achievement if The Tree of Life hadn't somehow surpassed it. John Toll's photography and the way smoke is used gives the whole thing a really eerie feel, like you're seeing the worst crimes against peace being committed and why man doesn't deserve to live in Eden.  Shooting the movie from the perspective of soldiers on their knees in the grass could have just been an attempt to do something different and technically accurate in another movie but it really contributes to this movie thematically as well. That's the thing about Malick, like his movies or not, he does spend years thinking all this stuff through, and at the same time, has great instincts on how to improvise. (And when to let his crew do it.)  I like Zimmer's score too, it definitely sounds like him, but also not a whole lot like anything else he's done. He's a weirder fit for Malick than Horner, Desplat or Morricone but an obvious choice for a war movie."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,ethernetcord,2,Mon Jun 29 05:20:31 2015 UTC,"Oh come on Hadri, don't be feeble and love Bicycle Thieves more than better Italian films of the period. Serious question though, why did it work for you more than those others?"
TrueFilm,3bejg2,TrumanB-12,2,Sun Jun 28 14:52:01 2015 UTC,"Well whatever they are I haven't seen them yet, Bicycle Thieves is what everyone watches first anyway. You mean the Ingrid Bergman trilogy, Visconti, etc right?   Bicycle Thieves seemed like a perfect story to me. It's not becoming one of my favorite movies or anything, but it's a little fable about how poverty works and makes people feel, without any narrative fat or unnecessary style. For example Germany Year Zero is attempting something similar but it's a little too in my face with the style and Berlin setting for something trying to be 'realistic' if that makes sense. It might as well be Ivan's Childhood.   I hadn't planned to watch it but guilted for not having seen it/not going to a discussion group that was covering it this week and we were all into it, even though it turned out nobody there really gets Neorealism. Maybe that's a good thing though. I think it transcends that label.  The other thing I can think of to say is that everyone in America wants to talk about poverty in theory but a lot of the sanctioned narratives about it are worthless, political dead ends so it was refreshing to see a story this raw and personal about it."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,ethernetcord,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:20:44 2015 UTC,"Were you refering to Italian Neorealism or in a more broader sense? Im only asking because I only heard of Italian Neorealism but I guess it can stretch to Bergman but I would say it is not the same neorealism that Bicycle Thieves had. I thought the main neorealist directors were Luchino Visconti, Roberto Rossellini,Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini , etc."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,TrumanB-12,4,Fri Jul 3 21:07:32 2015 UTC,"United Passions I've talked about this a lot already. If you want to read a 4,000 word review, it's linked here.  Jurassic World It was fairly good in the beginning, but it got extremely stupid towards the end. We moved from a subversive - albeit heavy-handed - critique of Hollywood sequels to a really stupid dinosaur battle at the end. Outrunning a T-Rex in high heels? Triple crosses by raptors? That bit at the end where that Raptor exchanged a knowing look with Owen? It's like the writers just decided to completely destroy everything that they built up in the beginning for a mad plot and the standard 'big fight' that every blockbuster has at the end nowadays. This is what happens when you sit on a script for 14 years - a mix between the old-style and new-style blockbusters that was all over the place. Hopefully, Jurassic World 2 will be more focused.  Meteor Apocalypse and Air Collision I don't know why I keep on watching the Asylum's movies on 4music (it's a UK channel. They show them under a ""What the Flicks?"" banner.) really late in the evening. My time is probably better spent going to sleep instead.  12 Rounds  Fairly standard action fare and it's completely implausible. Many things from Speed and Die Hard are shamelessly reused. It's also really odd watching John Cena vs Aidan Gillen.  I'm watching Going Clear tomorrow. I am in desperate need of a palate cleanser."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,waunakonor,2,Sun Jun 28 15:12:37 2015 UTC,"First 3 Pirates of the Caribbean movies (2003, 2006, 2007) I haven't seen these since I saw them upon release in theaters. I remembered loving the first and thinking all the others kind of sucked. Rewatching them all in one weekend I realized I wasn't quite remembering correctly. Their is a lot more work put into making this a cohesive trilogy than I remembered. I think it was because I just couldn't really follow everything that was happening when I was younger, I kind of thought all the sequels were just tacked on cash ins but that isn't the case. The first and second movies are both really really good. Two of my favorite big budget blockbusters to be released in my lifetime. A few action sequences of the 2nd movie are still some of the best to date, (dat running from the cannibals bone cage rolling down the hill scene, and sword fighting on the rolling water wheel thingy) The 3rd one was a let down though and the worst of the 3. It was too long and just dragged at times, but the story wraps it's self up in a good way that is worth seeing through, imo, for fans of the series. 9/9/7  The Cable Guy (1996) Love me some Jim Carrey but it isn't much better than I remembered it to be, meh, But it's Jim so... 7/10  Roman Holiday (1953) I'm sure it was probably good at the time, and it had some beautiful shots in Rome, of the Colosseum in particular and other things, but the type story has been emulated so many times that I really wasn't interested in it. Audrey is as cute as ever though. 7/10  Fright Night (2011) I loved this movie! I'm a huge fan of monster movies, vampires, horror and horror/comedy hybrids like this. Superbadish humor mixed with a Colin Farrel vampire in suburbia. I have never seen the original and will watch it soon, but this is the outcome of an actual well-made remake. 9/10  Laggies (2014) Perfect lazy Sunday afternoon film, nothing too ambitious but it has it's moments plus Keira Knightley and Sam Rockwell. You can see the cornyness coming from a mile away, but hey it's a lazy Sunday afternoon movie good for unwinding maybe after watching a string of other artsy, highly emotional, and intense films. 7/10  Due Date (2010) Meh. Failed attempt to cash in on the Hangover while heavily lifting from the script of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.  5/10"
TrueFilm,3bejg2,ownererz,2,Mon Jun 29 01:39:28 2015 UTC,"While I actually think the 3rd is the best of the bunch, it amazes me how the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy are possibly the only pirate epic movies I know.

TrueFilm,3bejg2,BootStiefel,2,Mon Jun 29 15:16:47 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of a novice at discussing movies like this, so be nice.  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - What a great trip. Even though I was totally sober watching Fear and Loathing, I felt like I was stumbling all around various hotels in LV in a drug-fueled right alongside Johnny Depp and company. The imagery suggesting life is a tunnel with no life at the end was a perfect way to wrap up this extremely fun yet overtly gloomy ride, which seems to lack specific direction but is all the better for it. I see a lot of hate for Depp, and given his recent decision-making it seems deserved, but it's still great to see him hamming it up in a role like this and being a legitimately engaging performer back before he in Tim Burton jumped the shark together.  Three Kings - This movie was released about two years before 9/11, but it's probably going to be very relevant for a long time.. It really does a great job overall of depicting the struggle of Iraqi soldiers and citizens while for the most part portraying the main characters as decent yet very flawed humans who just want to come into a village to get some of that cash. Three Kings looks great - the settings feel very real and the shots do a great job of juxtaposing the endless, unforgiving desert with the struggles of our protagonists. George Clooney, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze also deliver typically convincing and engaging performances. Mark Wahlberg lets the whole thing down somewhat; I just can't get into him as an actor whether he's in an extremely stressful interrogation scene or feeling cheerful and happy. The ending also feels a bit sappy; I don't have a problem with happy endings, but this one laid the sentimentality a bit heavy-handedly without really knowing how to make the audience actually feel anything (see below for a movie that's aggressively sentimental but goes about it perfectly). I could also do with a bit less of a ""Look at these super heroic Americans doing a good deed and helping out all those poor Arabs. Aren't Americans just so great?"" I'm being a bit harsh there because I doubt that's what DOR was going for there, but something about the way the camera focuses on the heroes and what's going on with them while the Iraqis just kind of stand there in the distance made me wonder exactly what the director was going for, and it turned me off to what was going on during the closing minutes. Very goof movie overall, though.  Cinema Paradiso - Watching this on Netflix, the movie begins with a lengthy scrolling list of all the awards it apparently won. Okay, whatever. Hopefully it's a good as it thinks it is. With that in mind, I was pretty disappointed with Cinema Paradiso. The first half or so is really fun and interesting overall. It follows a young boy discovering the joys of experiencing the art of cinema, and wanting to learn more about it. The host of various side characters living in the village together with him provide a lot of color and heart to the story of the boy's life as the film progresses. This all changes when he abruptly shifts into being a young adult. Suddenly we're forced into this really awful romance subplot featuring this creepy young man standing outside his crush's house every day because he heard it in a folk tale once, even though the girl clearly expressed no interest in him. Then we're supposed to feel sad for him when he starts moping around and tearing shit up because he's mad that his foolproof plan didn't work. But then... Oh, it actually did work, and now she's in love. Barf. Mercifully, she moves away not too long later, and it seems like the movie's going to get back on track by going back to the basics of Toto and Alfredo's relationship. Unfortunately, no; instead, it takes another sudden turn when he's suddenly an older man going back to his old village. He sees all his old friends in the village, which could have been touching if it weren't so god damned cheesy, and to be honest Ennio Morricone's sweeping orchestral score really did not help matters here. And frankly, the rather pessimistic theme that's presented regarding the state of the movie industry comes off as rather humorous in retrospect considering that movie theaters seem to be doing just fine nowadays. I don't know, maybe this was more interesting back in 1988, but watching it today I just kind of found it annoying. If it had ended shortly after the fire this could have been a really good short film; but alas, they had to pad it with all this unnecessarily cheesy bullshit.  Inglourious Basterds - My goodness, Tarantino is a master behind the camera. As usual, every shot and line of conversation is absolutely dripping with his endearing style and natural sense of how to get the most out of every movement and facial expression of every character. One little action can totally change the tone and balance of any given conversation in both subtle and hilariously blatant ways, and QT is extremely capable of making sure the audience knows exactly what's going on with the characters in any given moment while still respecting our intelligence. Christoph Waltz obviously deserve high praise for his simultaneously hilarious and horrifying performance as a Nazi officer who has total control of almost every situation and takes great joy in playing with his food, but I think Mélanie Laurent also deserve mention for her portrayal of a young woman who's being thrown into situations she doesn't fully understand with people she despises, and later her fierce determination to set her theater full of Germans ablaze is even more infectious than Brad Pitt's sheer joy for killing and scalping the Nat-sees. Perhaps more credit is due to Tarantino for his typical skill of crafting badass yet very human female characters, but I think Laurent deserves more praise than I've seen her get for her part. As a side note, I found it interesting that I happened to watch two movies in a row with a major plot point revolving around the fact that old film reels are extremely flammable.  Patton - I'm going to be honest, I don't really know where to begin with this one at the moment. To be sure, it's a great war film that I found nearly endlessly fascinating while watching. The character of George S. Patton, who as I understand it is fairly faithful to the real-life Patton, seems like a simple man on the surface yet becomes exceedingly difficult to pin down exactly. He's a classical man who admires historical figures and feels every problem can be fixed based on the guidelines set by leaders who are long dead and battles that occurred millennia ago, and he could really stand to learn how to be more empathetic and understanding, yet above all he just wants to go out and fulfill his supposed duty, and even if one strongly dislikes him for some of his actions his difficult to not have some level of respect for the wisdom he freely offers and his eagerness to get out and fight. Title character aside, the battles are magnificently portrayed in mostly extreme-long shots, with the camera spending most of its time showing the POV of generals observing their armies while simultaneously giving the viewer on the other side of the screen an exquisitely choreographed spectacle with little more than human beings and lots of pyrotechnics. And besides George C. Scott's masterful performance as Patton, pretty much all the supporting characters around him are fleshed out as well as they can be without steeling GSP's spotlight too much, and all the performances do justice to the massive amount of effort that went into this movie. This one will require another rewatch or two to attempt fully unpack Patton's character and motivations and the intricacies of Scott's portrayal, but even now I know that I definitely enjoyed myself.  Inside Out - Thank God for Pixar. They were on an insane streak with Wall-E, Up and Toy Story 3, crafting vivid, wonderful piece of art that speak the language of kids and simultaneously give both their parents and whoever else happens to be in the theater something to appreciate on a completely different level. And their consistent quality kept adults coming back into the theater whether or not they were accompanied by kids, because the studio was doing their part to tear down the toxic notion that animated movies are for kids. After that, Cars 2 was fun but disappointingly ham-fisted in its message, and Brave honestly felt like a bit of an insult. Monster's University was a step in the right direction, but I still wondered if they were still capable of pulling out another masterpiece like in the glory days. I'm wondering that no more because they've impressed me once again. Pete Docter should really write a book on how to hit the right emotional chords as precisely the right time, because I still can't quite figure out how he's able to make his sentimental climaxes to damn perfect. The cast is given material that does their comedic sensibilities great justice, and Amy Poehler in particular proves that she needs to continue to appear in more stuff. And while the bright, colorful things flying around and hilarious jokes for both the kiddies and adults entertain greatly, its mature approach to the topic of deep sorrow and depression (not to be confused; the latter is not being able to feel anything at all) is nearly unmatched in cinema as far as I know. I'm a bit disappointed that after The Good Dinosaur Pixar will be releasing four sequels in a row, but lets hope they can manage to keep putting out products that say something to everyone and have oodles of genuine heart to spare.  I'm also probably going to be seeing Boyhood later because I adore that movie, and my brother hasn't seen it yet."

I was very presently surprised. Just like any number of films it is set during the Guadalcanal campaign and follows a group of soldiers fighting their way through the Japanese lines. Yet the film's brilliant cinematography  and writing produce a film among the lines of Apocalypse Now or Platoon."

I've been a filmmaker for years and hold shame for not knowing most of the great films of the 20th century. So I'm playing catch up, but here's what I saw the last few days:  Inside Out - This film truly was a wonderful call back to the early days of Pixar. I loved most of the movie and have few issues with it, mostly being that the parents characters seemed really flat and didn't have much else going on. I would've liked for a little more character development, but as I type this out, it occurs to me that the role of minor characters really don't have much development. I think it would've been nice to at least know what the Dad did for a living that justified a move, but I guess since it didn't matter to Riley, it didn't matter to us. The film was incredibly charming and although the trope of seeing characters inside someone's head be active has been used before, they found a new, beautiful spin on it. So far it's the best thing I've seen all year.  Grave of the Fireflies - I had not seen this film before, but it was mentioned on an askreddit to the tune of ""What movies have melted your soul?"" I figured this movie couldn't touch my personal soul melter (Requiem for a Dream), so I went in expecting to be scarred, but not scarred much. BOY WAS I WRONG. The loving relationship between the brother and sister was so well done and the characters really were dragged through the mud by everything they came up against. I don't think I'll be seeing it again any time soon, but it is worth seeing once for sure.  Ivan's Childhood - I've seen nothing by the great Tartavosky, so I knew it was time to get started. u/tonyszhou suggested in his IAMA to start with this one, so I did. I was blown away by the cinematography right from go. The dream sequences blew me away considering the year of the film and I didn't think the child acting sucked at all...which is pretty rare for me. I know for sure I'll be watching it again in the future as there was so much to appreciate that I kind of got lost in the film.  The Skeleton Twins - This movie wasn't what I expected it to be from watching the trailer, because I thought it would have a lot more humor then it ended up having. For what it was, it was done well. The writing was pretty good and the directing was fairly standard for the indie flair the film was going for. Don't really have interest in seeing it again, but for what it was, I thought it was just okay."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,lordhadri,3,Mon Jun 29 16:43:02 2015 UTC,Ivan's Childhood while brilliant is like the testing grounds for Tarkovsky as he's not quite nailed down his style yet.

Except for the car design, the action sequences and a couple of long shots, a completely inept movie in every sense. Its critical and public acclaim, although thankfully not unanimous, expresses a kind of minor but very vocal incompetence of the average moviegoer/""critic"" to read a movie.   The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is cringeworthy, the story is the typical frankenmovie where things are added from the outside by producers, the context is convoluted, the plot is ludicrous, the whole thing is simply incompetently made."

This is exactly what we meant when discussing what kind of standards action movies should be held to. I have no idea what sort of recent action movie you'd consider to be done better.

For me, this is one of the few modern blockbusters that really feels like it's telling a cohesive, singular story from start to finish with no ridiculous side-plots or shoe-horned romance stories.   And the plot is ludicrous, I agree completely, but I really wouldn't want it any way. With the world of Mad Max, there is no way to suspend disbelief other than by turning the dumb-levels to 11 and just making everything outlandish and insane, which is something I thought the film pulled off perfectly."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,12YearOldGayKids,-2,Sun Jun 28 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"The script's rewrites and reshoots have been well publicized. You see how Furiosa's character gained time as Max became a sidekick. Also: distracting, laughable bits of dialogue and jargon attempting to be socially conscious (""acqua cola"").   The context is summarily presented without much development, which strongly hints at a very different original idea. Characters and plot devices are discarded along the way.The plot (let's run away, chase scenes/ok, let's go back, chase scenes) is stupid beyond belief. Bloated w/ ideological bias, cartoonish acting, too many action sequences and childlike notions of edginess, the movie feels at once juvenile and senile."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,TrumanB-12,5,Sun Jun 28 18:22:30 2015 UTC,"Just because there were rewrites doesn't mean they inherently make the movie worse.   I liked the fact that Furiosa became more of a prominent character because it allows the major themes of the movie to be that much more apparent and allows the movie to delve into them more. Max has always been a secondary character in the franchise, he's more of an audience surrogate to enter into the crazy, irrational, insane world of the movie. That's the way that I view it, so it makes Max's quietness that much logical because he's just there to ""WITNESS"" much like the audience is. But Max gets some pretty great action scenes as well.  And you're right, it is juvenile, cartoonish, and 'edgy'. But what else could it possibly be? Maybe we have different qualifiers of what makes a movie good, but for me if a movie is what it wants to be then it's a success. Shamelessly stolen from Roger Ebert, but I think it's a  good criteria for judgement. And Mad Max does everything it wants to do and not a single thing more or less.   But it seems we might just not agree, and that's okay."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,attacktei,-4,Sun Jun 28 18:31:36 2015 UTC,"Just because there were rewrites doesn't mean they inherently make the movie worse.   In this case they clearly did: the character development is an amateurish mess. Some characters are overwritten, others are underwritten. Worse than that, the writers had to resort to outright caricature in order to give minor characters a semblance of relevance.   The second level of failure in the movie script is that the story itself is set in a way that hints at a complex interaction of clannish conflicts but then becomes a simplistic chase. A similiar watering down can be seen on Jupiter Ascending.   I strongly disagree that Max was a secondary character on the original movies, where he acts like the classic, silent lawgiver of the greatest Westerns. On Fury Road, he's a traumatized survivor who rides shotgun and runs errands while a seemingly all-knowing, all-enduring female pushes the story forward. It seemed profoundly unrealistic given her disability, the harsh conditions of the roads (so to speak) and the necessarily rudimentary technology of her prosthetic arm."
TrueFilm,3bejg2,EeZB8a,4,Sun Jun 28 18:57:03 2015 UTC,"But why should the movie have to tell a complex story of warring clans if it simply wants to tell a great, well-plotted chase scene? That's where I'm coming from here. It gives you just enough about the clans (through brilliant, almost-hidden exposition) and lets that get out of the way to just tell the story the movie is supposed to be telling.  Star Wars A New Hope (first comparison that came to mind) is similar. There's a backdrop of huge interstellar conflict and rebellion against dictatorship, but we really only get small hints of that. In that movie, it's not known why the rebels started their rebellion, but through small details and hints we can piece together the culture of these two groups, the Empire and the Rebellion. Mad Max is similar. We're never told that Immortan Joe holds Gas Town and the Bullet Farms in his grip because of his monopoly on water because it's obvious, and the short bursts of dialogue between the leaders of those factions is all we need to grasp the majority of the relationship so we can get on with the actual movie.  There's not a single scene of blatant, ""let's pause and tell the audience what's going on"" exposition in the movie, totally unlike Jupiter Ascending, which is exposition: the movie. That's something that blew me away about Mad Max. It's a self-contained story that quickly tells the plot it wants to tell, gives a hint about what this could mean for it's world at the end, and then ends as the story ends. It's a great sreenplay that, for all the dumb, juvenile ridiculousness, accomplishes everything it wants to.  I don't get why you think Max has to be the dynamic character in this movie. It's named after him, but it's clearly not about him. Why focus on that so much?  Edit: and as for caricature, I agree. They are. I guess where you and I differ is that I don't care about that because the entire movie is a caricature, and so the only way I can keep up my suspension of disbelief is if the characters are as flat-out crazy and illogical as the premise and setting is."
TrueFilm,3bep6e,wmille15,2,Sun Jun 28 15:17:50 2015 UTC,"You can sense the relationship and the struggle between these two men in the first seconds of this clip, where Vincent’s line, “Max, I do this for a living”, is edited and broken into something more interpersonal:  (0:00) Vincent: “Max,”  Medium close-up of Vincent at the far right of the 2.35:1 frame, moving left and holding gun left, or towards the long side of the frame. (0:01) Wide-angle close-up of Max, framed left, contemplating down and left at the short side of the frame, with object of Max’s conflict and motivation, Annie, in background framed right, between Max and Vincent. (0:03) Vincent: “I do this for a living.” Same shot of Vincent, still moving left, but now allowing him to close in from right to left across the frame.  And then we go back to the close-up of Max, where after another moment of contemplation, he seems to shake Vincent out of his head and then turns to match Vincent in open fire.   I love the use of blues and oranges in the production design of this scene. One shot at 0:29 gives us a dominant square orange Metro sign at left, next to two vertical panels of soft light blue around the door, and across from the soft orange of Vincent’s blood at right. Then we have the spectacular shot later at 1:25, the medium-long shot where Vincent mutters his last words, where we have two dominant square blue seats next to the soft blue of the train and orange of Vincent’s blood again, now with the massive LA night in a dark and subtle orange glow traveling across the background. That digital glow of the LA night is probably the movie’s biggest visual theme, and it is never more ominous than in this scene, particularly at 1:15 where Vincent's reflection is surrounded by the moving night like a ghost in hell."
TrueFilm,3bep6e,CollumMcJingleballs,2,Sun Jun 28 15:27:54 2015 UTC,"I remember watching Collateral with the commentary by Michael Mann and he was talking about paying special attention to what was being projected outside the train windows, while following along with the action, one of his sentiments talked about this black tree that he liked so much that was a symbol of Vincent's death. How once that passes the movie is essentially acknowledging that this is not an ambiguous death, but a total  utter complete, no sequel, and sincere death."
TrueFilm,3bep6e,blundersinbulk,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:25:27 2015 UTC,"That's great. I noticed that tree before, and yeah, looking at it again, that's an ominous image. That tree rises out of him and fills the window and it is so dark. Man, I was just thinking I need to get ahold of the DVD or something and listen to Mann's commentary. I've been reading pieces about Collateral since yesterday and several brought up that commentary. I am fascinated with how this movie was made, and what kind of force Mann is on set.   But yeah, I only recently realized when I saw it here that the subway windows are projections. It actually makes those scenes much more intriguing to watch, when you know each background was created in the editing room."
TrueFilm,3bep6e,PeterKien,2,Mon Jun 29 16:49:55 2015 UTC,"Max and Vincent start off occupying opposite/opposing sides of the frame. Vincent steadily charges in from the right, whereas Max is stuck in the left, facing the wall of the frame.   At 0:08 Max decides to face Vincent head on, literally turning to the right where Vincent is charging from. At 0:09 the lights start bugging out the shoutout starts. At 0:10 Max attempts to push into Vincent's side of the frame before being cut off by Vincent at 0:11. Max returns fire at 0:12, pushing against the center of the frame, but still on the left half. Vincent fires. Max fires. Vincent fires.   End of 0:13 Max has been pushed back to the left, but still facing and firing to the right. 0:15 Max pushes into the right again, but this time he stays there. The cuts stop, with this shot holding until the back half of 0:18, almost 4 seconds, a real breather compared to the shots before.  There is an ambiguity to main four shots of the struggle of the frame at 0:10, 0:12-0:13 and 0:15, because the figure in frame is wrapped in darkness, but we are still signaled to the figure being Max because of how the characters have been established spatially. We are also clued into that through the editing, with the way those shots alternate with clear shots of Vincent. The editing creates an implied cause and effect, alone with the gunshots and the glass breaking showing it.   The ambiguity is removed completely when the lights come on, which, along with slower cuts, tell us that the fight is over. In the light the characters are back in their original sides until Vincent realizes that he's been hit, at which point he admits defeat and steps down from his spot (0:44) allowing for Max to step onto it (0:52). The shots where Vincent comes to realize that he's going to die are the only shots where Vincent is closer to the camera than Max.  The characters stay in these switches positions for the rest of the clip, their dynamic having been completely reversed and evolved. Now that their conflict has ended they're able to share the frame; there is a peace, an acceptance and an empathy between them.  The shot at 1:26 keeps their new right/left relationship, but Vincent resides in the same side of the frame as Max. He's small in the frame, dwarfed by emptiness. He admits that he's as lonely and scared and unsure as Max ever was.   This is a sincere moment in their relationship, and in response to Vincent's vulnerability Max meets him in the middle of the frame, with Vincent and his reflection on either side of him. In the shot where Vincent dies, he's alone on the screen, but he's positioned right next to where Max was in the previous shot. When he dies it's as if he's leaning to rest on Max's shoulder.   Maaaaan, I've spent more time on this than I meant to. This is pretty damn long. I have a few more thoughts though. In the last shot of Max, Max is center frame, in between Annie and Vincent's reflection. Sandwiched between future and past? Vincent's reflection is ghostlike in the window. And maybe it's an acknowledgement of how he wouldn't have made it to his future with Annie without Vincent. Also Max and Vincent are visually very paralleled or foiled. They look the complete opposite of each other, and behind Vincent is mostly darkness whereas behind Max is light. The contrast is the biggest at 1:46 and 1:58. The way the light comes onto Max is also like him stepping into something new for himself. Or like a visual way to show his growth and new understanding."

TrueFilm,3bed69,Toribor,24,Fri Jul 3 15:27:52 2015 UTC,"Lots of these scenes are intended to depict how foreign and alien space is to mankind. That we're out of our element, packed into little bags trying to breath because everything else is so hostile.  So yeah, maybe there is a scene that feels like it's someone in a spacesuit just breathing for 20 minutes, but it meticulously illustrates the fragility of man. Obviously it's going to seem slow paced if you put it side by side with something like Gravity which is a space roller coaster ride, but that wasn't the goal.  Look at how often a human character is dwarfed by their surroundings, or how often the focus of the scene is entirely surrounded by blackness. This forces a perspective change that focuses on an absolutely gigantic sense of scale. The pacing is deliberately slow and is intended to force you to appreciate the magnitude of these events, the empty void of space and the lurking silent danger of the ever watchful HAL."
TrueFilm,3bed69,salierniwasokay,14,Sun Jun 28 13:33:36 2015 UTC,"You've gotten some great responses already, but I'll also add: if you interpret one of the film's goals as commenting on human evolution and our next steps, then a long, drawn-out approach to the scenes makes sense. 2001 spans millions of years and numerous leaps in intelligence, and a slow pace depicts this long path.   Overall, I think the slow pacing just adds to the atmosphere of the film. The movie is methodical and philosophical, and I think Kubrick really wanted the audience to contemplate everything that was going on and give them the chance to digest all of it. The pace forces you to look deeper into the screen and (for some) helps them get lost in the film (and lost in outer space/the unknown). If you're prepared to embrace the slow pace, the film becomes almost meditative.   Of course, this doesn't work for everyone as we all have different tastes, but those are just some of the reasons why Kubrick might have gone with such slow pacing."
TrueFilm,3bed69,mbuckbee,14,Sun Jun 28 13:59:20 2015 UTC,"Today we don't think of Kubrick as a ""special effects guy"" (ala Michael Bay), but you have to  consider when it was released just how mind blowing the special effects shots were.  They hold up. They don't look cheesy. They don't scream 'hey I'm a special effects shot, something crazy is happening'. They just look incredibly realistic in an age way before any CG work could be done.   2001 was released in 1968. The same year as Planet of the Apes. Checkout how goofy and period specific the filming of Planet of the Apes looks:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjcpRHuPjOI  I'm not knocking Apes, so much as just trying to point out what everything else looked like at the time. Imagine that you're a serious SciFi fan. You've spent the past two years watching the Original Star trek (aired in 1966) - with the very obvious sets, the hand waving of seamless gravity throughout the Enterprise, etc and then you sit down in the theater and see this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iiXUeil5fQ  And your reaction then would be: ""OMG WTF - how did he do that!"", and it's a testament to how well it holds up now that it reads as ""boring"" (as we routinely see way crazier visual fx) rather than ""cheap"" or ""fake"".   While there's certainly pacing reasons, etc. you can't forget (as weird as it sounds) that 2001 was a big budget blockbuster special effects movie as well and the lingering shots of day to day space life were mind blowing for their time."
TrueFilm,3bed69,Mothravka,6,Sun Jun 28 14:39:41 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily see a slow pace being something bad or a disadvantage. Rather the opposite, it gives time to appretiate things like sound, the images, lightning, editing (especially if it's good and/or interesting) etc., it also gives me time to think and feel. I'm not in a hurry. The scenes are in the exact pace that Kubrick meant them to be. In real life, things move as they do, and a big part of cinema does mimic that. Sometimes movies could also invoke a feeling of immersion of time, something that Tarkovsky was good at for example, the feeling of being lost in time in the film."
TrueFilm,3bed69,AlfredArcher,2,Sun Jun 28 13:32:29 2015 UTC,"From my viewing, I think that part of it is that it's such a visually striking film, the slow scenes were used almost as a showcase. Obviously with the progression of cinematic techniques the way it is, a lot of what Kubrick did would've been, at the time, considered groundbreaking, but by today's standard has become much easier to create and more commonplace so it doesn't carry the same kind of initial wonder or marvel.  At the same time, I think Kubrick was trying to create a much more realistic and accessible world for the audience, by allowing the cinematography to react in the same way the audience would if we were there, by taking a step back and allowing it to sink in."
TrueFilm,3bed69,Anichula,2,Sun Jun 28 13:46:50 2015 UTC,"A lot of the slower paced scenes are really to highlight how used to technology we have grown accustomed to. Notice on the PanAm flight to the moon Floyd is sleeping, there is no dialogue and nothing of any interest is really going on. Except for the fact that they're flying to the moon! Think about how technology today has us in its grip. Everyone has a phone, they're constantly on it. The speed and efficiency of this technology only makes us more and more dependent on it. Same with the slow scenes. Kubrick wanted to show that we as humans achieve these amazing feats but once the wow factor dies down, it becomes redundant and boring. Flying to the moon is as non exciting as flying domestic.   I agree with your statement of the film following a literary pace. Not to mention the fact that it was originally a piece of literature, its definitely a slow burn. But think of the last 20 minutes. Contrasted with the previous 2 hours its vibrancy is almost a slap in the face. But again, this mirrors real life: continual boredom interjected with fascinating and life altering moments. This mirroring is a HUGE theme within the Kubrickverse. Mirrors reflect and distort the true nature of man. We get bored with the amazing pursuits we've achieved, on the other hand we are constantly searching to accomplish higher states of being. The film comes full circle at the end with the birth of the star child. We began primitive and evolved into a more advanced (technological) state of being."
TrueFilm,3bed69,monkeyd_ace,2,Sun Jun 28 15:53:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's more of your generation being accustomed to being fast paced than the slower, more contemplative movies of the 60s.  Nowadays movies are all about fast pace. You can't have a scene last longer than a minute or else people will be staring at their Ipads (note: not applicable to everyone but my cousins and my friends do it all the time so I'm using that as experience). They give you two minutes to either give them: an action scene or a run down summary of the premise and if neither are interesting than your movie is lost.  2001 A Space Odyssey can't be summed up in the 1st few minutes, you have to watch the whole movie. It's slow because that's it's pacing. I'd compare it to a Waltz or a Symphony while most modern summer movies are 3 minute pop songs.  To your question, there's no true answer I can give you as to the meaning of each separate scene--but must there always be a meaning over each scene? I'm not a fan of heavy-handed symbolism and Kubrick uses it minimally and other slow directors like Tarkovsky actively avoid symbolism.  I enjoy 2001: A Space Odyssey because it's relaxing. It's visually beautiful. The visuals together with the music has produced one of the finest movies of all time. Sometimes I just want to watch a movie and relax without over thinking about the themes and such. 2001 ASO is a pretty simple movie. Most of the movie is based on implication rather than exposition. You can either enjoy it by looking for a meaning behind each scene or you can relax and enjoy the experience. To me, I'd go for the experience and probably look for the meanings after my eleventh rewatch."
TrueFilm,3bed69,gotitbadscreenwriter,3,Mon Jun 29 12:17:14 2015 UTC,"Some of the scenes don't serve symbolism or plot because they're just meant to create an unique experience. I think Kubrick made great movies because he understood that movies create experiences first and say things second. I found the slower scenes in 2001 to be meditative in a pleasant, sometimes profound way, but I can understand why you might have found them boring. I'm not always in the mood for slow films myself.   On a side note: you might find Soderbergh's 110-minute cut of 2001 interesting, if you can find it all since he took it down from his website."

TrueFilm,3bed69,bohoky,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:08:36 2015 UTC,"There has become an ever hastening set of film conventions which has given us today's summer blockbusters. I have in mind a generic 1950's dramatic film where a move from point A to B would be shown as putting on coats, exiting the front door, entering the car, the car pulling away and so on. The same movement today would be rendered as a flash cut to the new locale, later time, and different costume. I consider this an expository difference. One can easily say that the eliminated shots that would have been in the 1950s generic film have become unnecessary, relying on shorthand that we've developed and accepted.  There are some shots in 2001 that were showing off special effects too much. One of the most glaring to my eye was the landing of the spherical shuttle in the red-lit Clavius Base. It was like watching a lift descend, because that's what it is. I've never seen 2001 on hallucinogenics sufficient to make the stargate scene at the end work.  By contrast, some of the longer scenes give significant dramatic heft. You mention the space station scenes of which the hallway conversation with the Russians is a good examples. The Russians are circuitously asking questions that they know they won't get answers to and Floyd is just as deviously evasive. It makes even more sense if you think about that in the context of the cold war which was on the brink in the late 1960s and had been on Kubrick's mind since at least Dr. Strangelove. I find that scene very tense but it only plays out in what isn't said.  The long scene of Bowman running around the hamster wheel of Discovery could not work were it any shorter. Here we see the alienation of man at such a remove from society, a man who barely needs to exist because HAL could really run the whole show, a man surrounded by machinery and its dehumanizing effect. The length of that scene was essential to the feeling Kubrick was trying to convey.  As others have noted, even the scenes that I feel overlong have to be seen in the context of ""nothing like this had ever been filmed before"".   It is a contemplative film, no doubt. This can be seen clearly in the death of HAL which took a really long time but gave one time to think about what it even means for a machine to die.  Is it perfect? No, but what is? Was it a radically novel presentation of concepts and locales? Absolutely."
TrueFilm,3bed69,indiebass,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:49:12 2015 UTC,"Be prepared: any time you say anything that isn't overly flattering and gratuitously glowing about this movie, people will downvote you to oblivion or make sure their own opinion is loud enough to drown out any dissent.  And I never understood that type of rabid response that you don't seem to get from fans of any other film.  2001: A Space Odyssey is definitely a sacred cow when speaking about film history. Further: I think you were very deferential in your post, and humbly approached the community here with a legitimate question and asked something that I read as fairly well-thought out that you would like to have an answer to, or at least have explained.  You can see by the voting pattern here that 2001 isn't even to be questioned.   So to answer your question directly: yes, there are a lot of unnecessary scenes that slow the movie as a whole down. Or more accurately, it slows down the movie-viewing experience.   Some judicious editing could have improved the film and the experience of watching the film a great deal. As the movie stands, it is too long, the pacing makes it difficult for the viewer to remain engaged with the narrative, and there are a lot of scenes that could have been condensed without damaging the overall story being told.   I have argued in the past, and felt the wrath of serious film watchers as a result, that 2001: A Space Odyssey is actually not a good film. As soon as you say that, I think the general tendency is to say ""This guy is an idiot and I don't have to listen to anything he has to say"".  Again, I'm not sure why the response is always so severe.  I've seen A Space Odyssey at home, and at the theatre, so I've experienced it in different ways.  And I feel like I've seen it enough times to have an informed opinion on the film.  The fact of the matter is there are parts of the film that are simply unwatchable (I'm thinking specifically here of when the audio shifts to nothing but a shrill synthesized sine wave as the worst example of this).  And there are all the pacing issues you, I think very eloquently, noted above.    However, I think the problem with the film, more than anything else, is that it benefits from what I call ""The Radiohead Effect"".  That is: so many people have said that a piece of art is ""amazing"", that the merits of the art no longer matter.  Because if you don't agree with what those people say, you're ""uninformed"" or ""uncool"".  Then, your opinion lacks credibility because ""cool"" or ""Informed"" people have already made their minds up.  Then, at a certain point, people go along with that opinion because they don't want to seem like they're ""not with it"" and end up deluding themselves. Again: the actual quality of the work is no longer the driving force behind the criticism of it.    For anyone still reading this, all of what I'm saying is not to argue that 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't Important.  Quite the opposite.  Within the history of film it's one of the most important films ever made.  Anyone can see that the technical advancements made at the time are incredible, and its influence on films that followed in its wake is undeniable. I think students of film should watch it, but I also think it's OK to admit that someone may not enjoy the experience of watching it, too."
TrueFilm,3bed69,BurnedByCrohns,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:33:01 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile so I won't provide a full explanation, but the short of it is that many scenes were slower at least partly to show off the cool special effects work. Plus, the music is amazing and when you combine those two things it really makes the movie an experience  Edit: I would also like to add that the first scene when they are showing the space stations in orbit is a wonderful example of a graphic match. That transition from the bone in the air to that spaceship is my absolute favorite transition I have ever seen."
TrueFilm,3bed69,TheJoshider10,-1,Sun Jul 5 23:45:47 2015 UTC,"This is just me personally, but I feel the film could have cut out the filler space scenes, fit itself in around the 100 minute mark and the overall feel or message would have stayed the same. I just don't think we need to see for example the whole time the crew inspect the satellite. That scene could have easily been done in a minute without the need to show us them entering, exiting, inspecting and going back in for example.   A user on /r/movies made a good point in another thread. The film is very good to watch in the background whilst you're busy, as you'll look up and see beautiful shot after beautiful shot.

Those scenes make for an experience which, to me, makes a film complete and feel more real. Cutting it out would make the film boring, just a series of actions."

I don't need to see extended footage of these simple tasks to be in awe or feel like it adds to the experience because to me it does not. I wish it did but I gave the film my fullest attention with no distraction and ultimately I was just waiting for something to happen and for the plot to be furthered along.   After seeing the complete experience for the first time, I see no reason why I should do it again until a few years and in that respect having it as a film to put on in the background to just look at and admire the beautiful shots doesn't seem like I don't enjoy films, if anything it suggests I can work it into every day life to appreciate the beauty in how well done certain scenes are."
TrueFilm,3bdc0m,jadedSEVEN,16,Sun Jun 28 03:38:30 2015 UTC,"I watched this recently, and I definitely have to agree that the main character is Tuco. I think that where the movie has to split between the scenes with Clint Eastwood and the ones with the 'Bad' (can never remember his name), Tuco isn't inherently tied to other, so he can be given more screen time, more development, and more depth since he's more than just 'good' or 'bad'. Second option for main character would be the 'Bad', because even he had more character development (independent ventures, histories with other characters)."

When you really think about it, Blondie never really did leave Tuco to die as much as he did leave Tuco stranded. Tuco could have probably cut through his ropes by scraping them on a tree (or something like that). Angel Eyes is still dead in the grave with a loaded gun and wearing a belt laced with ammunition, meaning Tuco could have took Angel Eyes's gun and loaded his empty gun with the rest of Angel Eyes's bullet. Maybe he could have raided Angel Eyes's wallet (assuming he has one) and got more money. Finally, right after Blondie blows the cannon that sends Tuco flying towards the graveyard, we can still see Tuco's horse in the background. Considering as how there are some very unnatural and strange coincidences in the movie, I don't think it's too big of a stretch to say that the horse could have still been there. Tuco could have then taken the gold and rode the horse back to the nearest town.  Just a thought."
TrueFilm,3bdc0m,pgibso,2,Sun Jun 28 13:50:30 2015 UTC,Fuck.. I misunderstood this whole movie.
TrueFilm,3bdc0m,Turbin3Blad3,2,Sun Jun 28 17:34:55 2015 UTC,"I have to say, I've never interpreted the ending of TGTBATU as Blondie leaving Tuco to die - merely incapacitating him a bit so he can get away."
TrueFilm,3bdc0m,00Banana,2,Sun Jun 28 17:48:16 2015 UTC,"Angel eyes was originally written for another actor who's name doesn't come immediately to mind. Either way the actor actually had blue eyes and blonde hair hence the name. Even after recasting, Leone liked the name and kept it."
TrueFilm,3bdc0m,Stereo_Panic,3,Mon Jun 29 00:30:43 2015 UTC,"I agree, but only because Blondie's development is spread over the course of the entire Dollars Trilogy and because his character sees a reversion to his classic gunslinging ways by the end of the movie (ditching the fancy clothing for the classic poncho.) Tuco and Angel Eyes are specific to this movie and we, as the audience, are less familiar with their characters and as a result see more developmental growth within them. However, on a similar and albeit humorous note, we have an extremely familiar trichotomy in Once Upon a Time in the West with Cheyenne, Frank and Harmonica, arguably you see more development within Cheyenne and Frank."
TrueFilm,3bdc0m,Duck-You-Sucker,23,Mon Jun 29 00:42:18 2015 UTC,I would say that it is the three of them. It is all their story you can not tell this story without all three of their points of view. If you  can only have one then i would say tuco if you see this as a standalone. If you watch the trilogy then it is an origin story for angle eyes
TrueFilm,3bdc0m,anonymousbear,8,Sun Jun 28 15:47:33 2015 UTC,"If you watch the trilogy then it is an origin story for angle eyes   Angle Eyes, the Asian gunslinger."
TrueFilm,3bdc0m,fenom,5,Sun Jun 28 09:41:14 2015 UTC,"That raises the question of whether or not Colonel Mortimer ( from For a Few Dollars More) is Angel Eyes however. If For a Few Dollars More takes place before the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, then it is possible, albeit unlikely. However, many details make it seem like The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is a prequel to For a Few Dollars More, which is a prequel to A Fistful of Dollars."
TrueFilm,3bdc0m,east_west_wood,10,Sun Jun 28 06:33:36 2015 UTC,The man with no name trilogy was never meant to be a trilogy from what Leone's said. It's three stories of a nameless drifter. Just like the mad max movies aren't really linked together except for the main character.

TrueFilm,3bdc0m,east_west_wood,12,Sun Jun 28 13:11:14 2015 UTC,"My dad showed me all three of the Dollar trilogy films when I was younger and, though I loved them all. The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly has always been my favorite film (of all time). I feel like one of my favorite draws to the film was Tuco and how each time I saw the film I noticed something interesting about him. I could go on about all the theories I have about each character but I'll try to sum it up. Sergio Leone named Tuco the Ugly because he represents the ugly truth about humanity. Life isn't fair to Tuco, he never had it easy, but he did everything he could to survive and in the end isn't that what we all do. Humans are capable of immense good, but also the immense bad as well. Are the best of us really good, are the worst of really bad. No, we are just brought up in an ugly world and we have to make the best of it."
TrueFilm,3bdc0m,east_west_wood,3,Sun Jun 28 15:29:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is how I interpreted it, the scene between Tuco and his brother is the only time we really get a glimpse of humanity amongst the three title characters.   I always see Tuco as the human, and Angle eyes /blondie are preator-natural figures, like the demonic characters in kabuki,  Tuco is bouncing between the schemes of the other two."
TrueFilm,3bdc0m,east_west_wood,2,Sun Jun 28 16:33:28 2015 UTC,"The Good and Bad start off the film as a guardian angel and demon on Tuco's shoulders, both coming off as his friend but later taking advantage of his trust and leaving him to die. I love how this movie presents Angel Eyes and Blondie as black and white characters at first, with one saving Tuco's life and the other killing an entire family in their opening scenes. But later they demonstrate that all their actions were driven by only one thing, greed. Blondie left Tuco to die after he realized that their was no more profit to be gained from him and Angel Eyes was a high ranked member of the Union army, who were the considered the ""Good Guys"" in the Civil war who tortured men to get information. Greed is the main drive for ever character in this film, Blondie, Angel Eyes and Tuco. (I also love that the song playing in their final showdown at the end was titled ""Ecstasy of Gold""). I LOVE THIS FILM."
TrueFilm,3bf027,whtruimplying,4,Sun Jun 28 17:01:18 2015 UTC,"I know it's controversial to share a negative opinion on this subreddit, but I really hate this movie. The fact that there is a parallel earth seemed to barely matter to the main plot and the plot itself seemed way too contrived to be believable. Visually it was terrible with the mix of grainy digital video and indie cliche handheld camerawork made it seem particularly amateurish."
TrueFilm,3bf027,LancasterDodd,4,Sun Jun 28 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"Negative opinions are just as welcome as positive here but I feel like you missed the point of the movie. The sci fi element was merely a symbolic representation of everything going on with Rhoda, she can't help but think about the life she could have had if she went off to MIT instead of prison, she is constantly looking at herself in mirrors yet disgusted with herself and feels that she deserve to suffer, yet the other earth is holding up a mirror to her, adding the the theme of duality throughout the movie including her relationship with the janitor who has also done something horrible in his past and cannot live with it, or as he says, he is tired of seeing himself everywhere.   I'm guessing you saw a trailer that tricked you into believing it was going to be a hardcore sci fi film and really at it's heart it is a tragic drama that could have been set anywhere without the sci fi, but it serves as strong symbolism.   The fact that there is a parallel earth seemed to barely matter to the main plot and the plot itself seemed way too contrived to be believable.    I mean no offence in saying this but I think you should stick only to non-fiction movies because if you can't suspend disbelief to any degree whatsoever you will never enjoy a fantasy or sci fi film.    Visually it was terrible with the mix of grainy digital video and indie cliche handheld camerawork made it seem particularly amateurish.   I think you might not having realized that this is an extremely low budget lo-fi science fiction movie. The entire thing was shot for $100k. Yes, $100k, think about how tiny of a budget that is. Avengers 2 had a budget of 279.9 MILLION, Another Earth had a budget of 100 THOUSAND.   I think your preconceived notions about the film before going in with it and inability to suspend disbelief on a sci fi concept which is actually pretty tame compared to most sci fi out there denied you the chance to appreciate this movie, but it's certainly not for everyone."
TrueFilm,3bf027,LancasterDodd,2,Sun Jun 28 21:40:07 2015 UTC,A couple of things.   I understand it is supposed to be metaphorical. I think the parallels are reaching at best. There is a difference between a contrivance in a naturalistic context (which despite the titular planet Another Earth is) and one in a deliberately artificial one. Suspension of disbelief is not a free pass to write unbelievable narratives. You even said the Sci Fi element is mainly symbolic. A low budget is not a free pass to not put consideration into having good or at least passable cinematography. Film is visual medium and when a films images are just plain ugly with no real sense of composition its a problem. Primer had a $7000 budget and it being a similarly low budgeted indie Sci Fi film makes it a good comparison. With almost no money Shane Carruth made a film that better looking than a film that had 14 time the budget. I'm not saying that a film shot digitally is inherently bad looking. What I'm saying is that from what I saw the filmmaker behind Another Earth treated how the film looks as an afterthought at best.   I'm not trying to say that my only problems were with the contrivances and the visuals just my non-engagement with the rest of the film made me unable to forgive them.
TrueFilm,3bf027,frakking-anustart,2,Mon Jun 29 03:05:28 2015 UTC,"I think we just have drastically different tastes. I don't think Primer looked good at all, and I thought it was straight up pretentious garbage whereas I think Another Earth is strangely beautiful despite the horrific elements in the narrative. A perfect example of this is the scene where Rhoda tries to kill herself which I felt was beautifully shot."
TrueFilm,3bf027,lowtenet,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:12:58 2015 UTC,"The cinematography fell flat for me too. I really was dissapointed with it because its such a facinating idea  It isn't that it is low budget. Its just that the director tried too many shots ""just that look copl"" instead of advancing the plot and/or looking cool.  But you can tell they tried"
TrueFilm,3bdejo,murkler42,2,Sun Jun 28 04:05:40 2015 UTC,Am I right in saying there is no auditory content in this film or is the sign language explained? If so how did you find discerning the narrative of the film or is it portrayed in a manner that you don't actually need auditory cues to keep up with what's happening?
TrueFilm,3bdejo,profbucko,4,Sun Jun 28 19:37:13 2015 UTC,There is no dialogue at all. Honestly it varied greatly. Sometimes there were scenes I couldn't tell what was happening immediately but then the next scene totally filled in the blank spaces and informed me of the story and other times I just figured out right away what was happening. In that sense it was a truly incredibly well made film and deserves a great deal of recognition. It was over ally surprisingly easy to follow which is a testament to the directors style
TrueFilm,3bdejo,profbucko,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"Apart from what I've read about the graphic content of the film I think watching The Tribe will be an entertaining if not interesting experience. I think directors should experiment more with sensory enhancement, or deprivation as is the case with The Tribe.  Did you find with the lack of auditory engagement that you could appreciate the aesthetic of the film more or were you searching for something to listen to?"
TrueFilm,3bdejo,profbucko,2,Sun Jun 28 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"Definitely super engaging. Although the long takes can be a bit tedious it was surprisingly fresh to watch and engage with.  However, there is one shot that I believe was too long for no necessary reason. Every other shot in terms of pacing, framing, action etc were all perfect in my mind. This isn't a spoiler, but I'd love to discuss it after you've seen it: the passport photo scene. It just was a static shot that made no sense for being that long. It was as if it was just used so that they could have a full scene of them getting their photos taken and then leaving. You could have cut so much sooner and I'm not sure why they didn't Again, curious to hear your thoughts when you've come back!"
TrueFilm,3bdejo,Tetsujin1138,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:25:00 2015 UTC,"Well that was bloody amazing. I loved it, raw and brutal and totally unforgiving. At the start I felt there was an almost tragi-comedy sense as the kid was just trying to catch up with everything. The second thing was facial expressions, almost to a stage acting level, such a powerful medium of conversation, even though there was none, it sounds counterintuitive but the faces were extremely loud. I'd love to have a deaf person's perspective on how they use facial expressions or interpret them, I imagine body language is a huge thing for them. I know that sounds shitty and pun-like, but that was the first thing that hit me about the interaction between the characters. Like I've never seen one man interrupt a class so quietly and consistently without saying a word.  In terms of the narrative, obviously I didn't understand what was happening between all the characters 100% of the time but for the most part it wasn't hard to follow.  I'm gonna get a bit SPOILERY now for anyone reading through the thread as I go over my main thoughts.  The whole enterprise is, on the one hand, familiar to audiences - a brutal gang culture, fuelled by a boarding school system where bullying is the norm and where, young women, inevitably, are on the bottom rung. The endemic violence and need to respond in kind reminded me, in particular, of other eastern European films such as Harmony Lessons (2013) and Ilmar Raag's The Class (2007).  Yet, despite the surface similarities, the director renders the situation utterly alien by setting it within the confines and environs of a school for the deaf, sternly warning viewers that there will be no subtitles, voice-over or translations, before the film begins. As there is no dialogue - everyone communicates in Ukranian sign language - we are not even privvy to the children's names (although they are named in press notes for ease of reference), which adds both another layer of estrangement and intensity, as full attention is required to understand and keep track of the players.  And it is in this intesity that Slaboshpytskiy pulls off his greatest trick, we are drawn into proceedings, straining to understand what happens as new kid Sergey (Grigory Fesenko) arrives at the instution, quickly homing in on a pecking order encapsulated in one trip to the cafeteria that sees his place instantly marked out as just one step above the kid with Down's Syndrome. As we strive to get closer to what is happening, Slaboshpytskiy's camera hangs back in long, lingering takes, keeping a distance so that we can better see the full range of gesticulated conversation between the characters, sometimes balletic, sometimes almost cartoonish but always conveying a well of emotion. As things take a more sinister turn later in the plot, the camera remains unflinching even as we suddenly wish we could turn away. And when cinematographer Valentin Vasyanovych comes closer, he often tracks characters from behind, which makes us all-too-aware of how vulnerable a deaf person is to things they cannot see - a lesson brought crushingly home in a darkly comic scene at the local truck stop, where the school gang bring the girls for nightly prostitution deals.  It is here that Sergey begins to make progress, climbing up the pecking order from basic scams to running the girls, while forming an attachment to one, Anya (Yana Novikova), based first purely in transactional terms - illustrated by a lengthy sex scene - but quickly morphing into something else. Buying and selling are everywhere, though profit appears to be bleakly minimal, yet Slaboshpytskiy goes to show, first through Anna and then the actions of Sergey that some transactions can hold a lot more - and worse - than we have bargained for.  The power of this drama also lies in the fact that although the protagonists are living in a world of silence, we can hear the other goings on around them - and when noises come from the cast, of exhiliration and, particularly, pain - they are all the more visceral for it. Slaboshpytskiy's film requires you to read its signs, about exploitation, isolation and fear - if you do, it speaks volumes.  With regard to the passport photo scene, I'm stumped, I dunno if there was any motivation to the styling of the shot or what was trying to be conveyed, I actually started starting intensely around every inch of the screen to see if I was missing something, maybe that's the point?"
TrueFilm,3baotw,CutTheBlueWire,83,Sat Jun 27 11:43:15 2015 UTC,"My favorite film is Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker. I'm in love with Andrei Tarkovsky. All of his films are just perfect. They are always so deliberate and never have any mistakes or any little decisions that might annoy me like in other movies. His movies are the best looking I've ever seen with perfect cinematography. And Stalker is my favorite of them. The first half is just interesting to watch as the movie is being set up, but then the second half is literally 1.5 hours of non-stop philosophy with extremely engrossing visuals and three of the most complex characters I've ever seen. This movie is also a great example of one that allows many interpretations. Everyone might get something a little different out of the conversations but it will be personal and you will come out feeling stronger and enlightened."
TrueFilm,3baotw,jugular_majesty,8,Sat Jun 27 13:32:39 2015 UTC,"Just watched this recently. I wasn't so enamoured with it, but that may have more to do with how distractible I was while watching. One thing I was surprised at how stunningly magnificent it was, was the sound. Stalker plays out against a living flowing backdrop of drips, plinks and echoes that for me did a better job of characterising the zone than Tarkovsky's cinematography."
TrueFilm,3baotw,ampersamp,9,Sat Jun 27 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"Cool. I've never really met anyone who's really into Tarkovsky, so now's my chance to ask something. I saw Tarkovsky's Solaris, but it didn't really move me. I thought it was beautifully shot, especially the scenes on Earth, but it left me feeling as if there's something I didn't get. What are the best aspects of this film? I feel I was especially detached from social context, any light to shed on that area of the film?"
TrueFilm,3baotw,robmox,9,Sat Jun 27 20:25:55 2015 UTC,"Solaris may be my second favorite of Tarkovsky's movies. For me, I really felt like a big part of the movie was delving into what it means to be human and the definition of a human. I think the scene that goes into this idea the most is the one where they are in the green room and it is one of the scientist's birthdays, and the conversation devolves into an argument about the woman. One of the scientists takes a very rational approach and says her feelings or desires are irrelevant because she is not human but just a fabrication of the ocean. But she says she still has emotions and basically functions like any other human does so she should be treated the same. The issue is interesting from Kris's perspective because he still loves her and has real human interactions with her like she would with the real person, so is it even relevant whether or not she is technically human if you still have real emotional interactions just the same? Another idea the movie brought up was the world we live in and interact with isn't really the real world but just our perceptions and memories of it. Like the woman isn't a real person; she is just reconstructed from Kris's memories. But really when we think we know a person, we don't really know them at all but just a fake version of that person that has been constructed in our mind based on past interactions.  I guess the broader ideas I got out of it was just that our own internal, emotional fulfillment is what's truly important in life as opposed to tangible achievements. Kris is on a space expedition that could have major influence but he decides he needs to come home to be among his family instead for his own health and happiness. I believe one of the scientists has a line in the movie along the lines of ""Humans explore so outward into space when really they should be looking inward into themselves."" And the fact that it ends up that the place he came back to is actually just an island on the ocean is really interesting and can probably be read many ways. I guess I see it as Kris is now just living in a fake world of his own emotions and perceptions and is happy with that. I guess it's up to the viewer whether that is a good thing or bad thing."

Tarkovsky was unbelievably interesting in how he shot his movies. I feel as if the way he elongated scenes, especially those involving nature, produce as much if not more intrigue than his plots/dialogue; this is especially true for Stalker. It also has one of the best endings in cinematic history. I sat in silence for a good 20 minutes after it was over thinking about the movie."

But apocalypse now puts you where you need to see wars from. It puts you right in the middle of madness and chaos wars create. It makes you horrified of war. It makes you repulsed by it."

The longer version has some additional political discussions,a lot of lead-up scenes, a lot of logistics related scenes. If you can relate to the tone of the shorter version, you don't need the longer version at all."

I view this movie as a ""war is hell movie"" much the same way you classified Apocalypse Now. I find this an interesting choice for a weekend that supposed to be all about America circle jerking it's self about how great it is because it portrays a war where America was at its worst, IMO.

TrueFilm,3baotw,hired_goon,68,Sun Jun 28 05:12:32 2015 UTC,"Network. It is the pinnacle of scriptwriting, and directing to the script. It starts you off with a voice-over and naturalistic dialogue so you think you're just watching some standard industry drama, so when the main character announces his suicide on air, the cold, un-dramatic corporate reaction seems appropriate (it isn't even noticed by the show crew because most are too focused on their jobs), and you begin caring about understanding the minutae of corporate politics and network programming. You get so sucked in that you don't realize the movie is going off the rails, throwing in communist revolutionaries, assassination plots, religious mass hysteria, some fucked up sex, and what pretty much amounts to the new world order.  Giving this script to one of my favorite directors? Fuck yes.   Then the ending comes, and it's quick. Some complain that it's too quick, but I see it as genius. Cause it finishes with that narrator again, over a simple shot of a TV screen. As simple as the beginning was. So you realize just how wild and far you come, and then the credits roll. The first time I saw this film, it was in 360p at 4 AM at a tiny computer, and I burst into shocked applause.  Lumet is subtle but powerful force in this film. I'll show you why. This is one of my favorite scenes from the film.   Watch the way it switches from manic medium shots when the argument begins, but is more of an impersonal debate. Then, when revelatory information is revealed, it cuts to quiet but threating close-ups as a more personal power-struggle begins. When the winner of the struggle is decided, the shots get wider again for Duvall. He is in control. Holden is still in closeups, and all you can see is the wall. He is quite literally backed up against it. When he leaves, it calms down for a moment of levity between Duvall and Dunaway, shot in still medium shots, with lots of details of the room in frame to ground you again. This is Lumet's subtlety.  Watch for, when Holden states his worries about his friend's well-being, Lumet shows Duvall smacking the newspaper, to foreshadow Holden's incoming irrelevancy. See Duvall at his most manic, he keeps repeating ""CCA board"" way more than he needs to. It's been established. A normal person would just start referring to them as ""the board"" or ""they/them"", since they could be the only ""them"" in the monologue. But Duvall keeps saying the full name, to the point where the S-sounds start slipping around everywhere, and he sounds like an idiot. A beautifully subtle way to show Duvall's fearful deference to his bosses, and a wonderful irony against the macho power move he is making."

It is by far my favorite, although I consider The Passion of Joan of Arc a close second, but that has been mentioned already.   First off, the pace of the film is so deliberate, so measured; just watching it makes you feel as if you’re playing a part in an 18th century social occasion for the higher classes. But, like Redmond, you just don’t quite belong.   Practically every frame of this film is worth studying. Color, framing, subject, every shot seems like a masterpiece in itself. The film feels utterly authentic, even though we’re in no position to even know what authentic means for the 18th century. It just feels right. The lighting, meant to evoke natural light, is a very large part of it. But the painting-like framing certainly helps. And the music, god, the music.  But more than that, the story is fantastic. I don’t want to give too much away, but the structure of the story is just so utterly satisfying. Our hero may not quite get the ending we might wish for him, but as it stands the whole is just so well balanced, it feels absolutely right. And, while by no means a short film, it is quite impressive to think how much story the film manages to portray whilst keeping every development so delicately paced. This is an epic, to be sure, much more ambitious than your average period piece.   Then again, our protagonist isn’t exactly heroic in the classical sense, but in his own way he fits the mold of an epic hero nonetheless. Certainly his exploits and desires are worthy of epic. Redmond Barry is a rogue of the first order, a character not necessarily similar in type but certainly similar in magnetism to someone like Han Solo. And while Ryan O’Neal’s Barry has none of Harrison Ford’s casual smugness, he certainly doesn’t think any less of himself, nor does he have any less ambition.  Yet he is not the only one worth watching. In fact, some of the smaller supporting roles are themselves fantastic, most notably the Captains Quinn, Feeney, and Potzdorf. And of course we have the ever memorable Lord Bullingdon, the perfect antagonist to our hero, contrasting him in every way imaginable. Ultimately, though, Ryan O’Neal’s portrayal of the conflicted rogue remains the standout among a myriad of amazing performances.   All in all a fantastic piece of cinema, I cannot recommend it enough. While all of Kubrick’s films are worth watching, you certainly don’t want to miss this one!"
TrueFilm,3baotw,sjarrel,8,Sat Jun 27 19:38:03 2015 UTC,"Came here to post this. Barry Lyndon is my all time favorite film for all the reasons you wrote!  For any Kubrick fans, Barry Lyndon is often overlooked but arguably his best work. It doesn't look as flashy as his bigger hits like Full Metal Jacket or as pop-cultural-y like Clockwork Orange, but it has everything you love from his other films, even though on the surface it seems to be a boring period piece about stuffy aristocrats talking about boring high society things. It's not. It's a stunning film on level, and every Kubrick fan should see it."
TrueFilm,3baotw,Syjefroi,48,Sat Jun 27 20:05:51 2015 UTC,"My favourite film would have to be La Montaña Sagrada (The Holy Mountain) by Alejandro Jodorowsky. An absolutely beautiful film with themes of mysticism and religion. Jodorwsky described the film as ""a way to enlightenment"" and that's exactly how i feel about it. Every new shot holds something interesting and i did not lose interest for a second."

I do like El Topo a lot (at least the first half, I do like the second half, but it ends up feeling like a totally different movie). Probably my third favorite Jodorowsky after Holy Mountain and Dance Of Reality"
TrueFilm,3baotw,UglyWallpapers,6,Sat Jun 27 15:06:56 2015 UTC,Hey cool! Its my band! Glad you liked it. I absolutely know what you mean about the two halves of the film and man oh man do I need to see Dance of Reality!
TrueFilm,3baotw,TyrannosaurusMax,40,Sat Jun 27 16:28:40 2015 UTC,"I wish I could be more eloquent and explain why, but Trainspotting is absolutely my favorite. I've never seen another movie capture the combination of diffidence and nervous, youthful energy that comes from growing up in a world that doesn't seem to have anything to offer. It does a wonderful job of showing, in a kinetic sort of way, the appeal and escape that drugs offer while showing the horrible fucking effects of heroin. The acting is incredible - Begbie is such an unpleasant bastard, Spud is so pitiable, and Renton and Sick Boy are perfect examples of where that life can take people who would probably be pretty normal and successful in other circumstances. The movie also has some pretty unique scenes, from the worst toilet in Scotland to Renton's withdrawals, and the music is perfect."
TrueFilm,3baotw,TheyDidItFirst,18,Sat Jun 27 17:38:28 2015 UTC,"Lawrence of Arabia is my alltime favourite film, and has been since I was 16.  It was the summer of 1998 and I went to the Blockbuster to rent Boogie Nights and I think Amistad. They wouldn't rent either to me, because I wasn't 17. So, I went and looked at their AFI 100 Best wall, and I ended up getting LoA and Citizen Kane.  I was home alone for the night and ended up watching both that night. I watched Lawrence first and it blew me away. The sheer scope of it was awe inspiring - and this was on letterbox VHS on an average sized TV. I loved the story and even though I missed out on a few subtleties at the time, I knew I had seen something much richer than any epic I had seen beforehand. I would later watch it in a theatre (about three years later at a rep house in Vancouver) and that just made as much as an impression, if not more. I have watched it probably five or six times since then - the most recently being two years ago when it came out on Blu-Ray. It's a fascinating film with strong performances across the board - Peter O'Toole is simply beautiful. The cinematography is jaw dropping. The fact that they got such beautiful shots while dealing with the sometimes blowing sands of the desert is no small miracle. Then of course there is Maurice Jarre's beautiful score is definitely one of the more memorable scores out there (hell, Stargate pretty much ripped it off wholesale). Anyhow...I tend to just gush about the film and look forward to showing it to people who have never seen it before.  I highly recommend that people watch this film at least once in a theatre if they can manage to do so. I've seen it projected on film and also the digital restoration from a couple years ago in a theatre.   I love this quote from Roger Ebert's Great Movie Review- it definitely hits the nail on the head for me:   I've noticed that when people remember “Lawrence of Arabia,” they don't talk about the details of the plot. They get a certain look in their eye, as if they are remembering the whole experience, and have never quite been able to put it into words."
TrueFilm,3baotw,drevill,17,Sat Jun 27 17:37:38 2015 UTC,"The Graduate is a film that I seem to never get tired of watching. I suppose it's because I relate to the themes and the sense of humor, as well as the story being so intense and characters being so fun to watch. A huge reason I love it, though, is that there are so many details that I keep discovering that give insight into the characters, which is important, especially in a film such as The Graduate which offers so little expository information in terms of characterization. Most of the information is delivered through the characters' actions and visual details. Choices in costume or set design offer as much information as the choice of shot framing, which offers as much information as the scripted elements. Every aspect of the film plays off of each other aspect so well. Nichols gets a lot of credit, but still not nearly enough for how perfectly executed this film is."
TrueFilm,3baotw,conorpd,2,Sat Jun 27 18:56:25 2015 UTC,"The Graduate is one of the only films I've ever seen that could be the basis for an entire class at college. It's remarkably detailed, I agree"
TrueFilm,3baotw,frakking-anustart,29,Sun Jun 28 04:32:07 2015 UTC,"My favourite movie is Der siebente Kontinent (1989) by Michael Haneke. For those who haven't seen it, it's about a middle-class couple that's living together with their daughter. They dream of escaping to Australia to start a new life. Their current life is monotonous and full of routines, but they decide to do something about it one day. First of all, I love the form and how uncompromising it is. There is no soundtrack, so the little music that exists in the film is diegetic. The color palette is very dry and bleak, just like the overall atmosphere. Haneke takes his time by telling the story with long and static takes instead of moving the camera, which I'm a big fan of, I think that just adds to the form and connects well with the monotonous life of the family. There's no clear answers, which I also admire Haneke for, he is great when it comes to asking important questions and making his audience think and feel. There's no other movie that made me feel as much as this one. It's just crushing. It's like a punch in the gut. Der siebente Kontinent (1989) also gives some interesting discussions about alienation, existentialism, society and materialism. One of my favourite scenes is the one with the family sitting and just staring while their TV is on with the song ""The Power of Love"" playing, a wonderful juxtaposition considering the nihilistic tone and depressing atmosphere the movie actually has. I can go on talking about it a bit more, but I'm not going to spoil out everything here, so this will do as for now. In my opinion, this movie is simply amazing and a true masterpiece."
TrueFilm,3baotw,Mothravka,2,Sat Jun 27 12:14:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't realise Haneke was my favourite director until only. Few months ago. I absolutely loved Cache, White Ribbon and Funny Games, movies that had me thinking long, long after they had finished and so I decided to do some more reading about them and to my absolute surprise they all had the writer / director. I'm saving Amour for a rainy Sunday afternoon and now it looks like I'll have to put this one on the list."
TrueFilm,3baotw,Channel6,3,Sat Jun 27 16:53:34 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend Code Unknown as well if you're into Haneke. It's a little more abstract and harder to follow, but it's quite enjoyable, and Juliette Binoche's performance is great as usual."
TrueFilm,3baotw,ericrohmer,2,Sat Jun 27 23:31:52 2015 UTC,"That film seems very interesting, especially the no soundtrack part I really like it when a film will cut one element to allow focus on another. It seems almost similar to Liverpool by Lisandro Alonso in theme and style."
TrueFilm,3baotw,Kafqesque,67,Sat Jun 27 12:23:18 2015 UTC,"Her (2013) by Spike Jonze  I don't have certain words to express how I feel about this film. Along with Malick's Tree of Life, Her is definitely my all time favourite movie. As I said, it captures something that's hard to describe. It's about love, loneliness, knowledge... It's deeply philosophical, existential movie. The whole atmosphere of it is just mesmerising."
TrueFilm,3baotw,BarelyLegalAlien,13,Sat Jun 27 18:08:43 2015 UTC,"I saw this thread and I was thinking I don't really have a favorite film for specific reasons, and I realized it might just be Her, but I don't know exactly why. The soundtrack and the visuals are beatiful and put me in a fantastic mood. In terms of plot and the themes, I guess it made me wonder about the future and more importantly about myself, my social life.  I don't know, I guess I identified with the whole movie.  Another film that gets me in a mood I can't explain is Blue is the Warmest Color. I think it just shows people being people and the whole sexuality theme actually was a side theme for me. Just people being people is what fascinated me and made me wonder about my whole social life, same as Her."
TrueFilm,3baotw,Zigguraticus,8,Sat Jun 27 19:20:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Her is my all-time favorite but it is what I have been telling people when they ask lately.   It is the most honest/earnest movies I have ever seen. It doesn't shy away from the uncomfortable moments. It paints a very realistic version of the future in a way that most films have a hard time nailing, especially because in Her it is the all the details that drive it home. Jonze does a great job of not hitting you over the head with it, or any messages in general. The movie doesn't try to argue anything to you, but it simply presents a situation that feels real. It also is one of the only movies where I can feel the protagonist really evolve in unexpected ways. Just such a great film. Also Scarjo's voice acting is fucking superb, not to mention that Phoenix's acting job is even more impressive when you realize that he is talking to himself for most of the film. Absolutely spectacular.   And in the end, it hit my heart so hard. It really nails the feeling of that first serious yet ultimately doomed relationship that so many (including myself) have had. The first time you really love someone but you end up growing apart for reasons beyond your control. Anyone who has been there knows exactly how that feels, and Her nails it.   The quote that gets me to cry every single time is where he says ""I've never loved anyone the way I loved you,"" and she says ""Me too. Now we know how."" That whole scene on the bed where they ""break up"" is so heart breaking if you have ever been there. It feels so incredibly real. Not many films can do that."
TrueFilm,3baotw,Kafqesque,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:59:43 2015 UTC,"Nice post :)   Personally, I haven't ""been there"", didn't have that whole breaking-up drama nor had I serious relationship. But still... This is the film which touches me the most. It evokes so much emotions, damn...It gives me chills even remembering it.   And I have to admit, this is probably the best portrayal of future if we're speaking about the utopian side of it - it just felt so natural.  Also, Spike Jonze created amazingly simple concept of AI - it has no body, so they didn't have to torture themselves with making visuals of some kind of robot-girl (as Ex Machina had, still another amazing flick) and yet it succeded perfectly with us hearing only the voice of Scarlett's AI. Jacquin Phoenix also fitted the role perfecly, I heard he's harsh and sort of vulgar IRL, but he just nailed it in Her.  The music. Damn, the soundtrack is one of the most fitting-to-the movie one. The ending song 'Supersymmetry' almost brought me to tears.  The visuals. Hoyte Van Hoytema did such a great job there.   Also the costumes. Everything's so well put together..  And all this is just an external surface of the movie. So much themes, so much questions to ponder inside. One quote sticks with me the most: ""Past is just the story we tell ourselves"".  The feels... Damn, such a phenomenal piece."
TrueFilm,3baotw,LarsVonThunder,31,Sun Jun 28 07:13:29 2015 UTC,"My favorite film is Synecdoche, New York by Charlie Kaufman. It's kind of funny that the first time I watched this film, I had no idea what to make of it. The weird tone, the odd pace, the strange shifts in time and I would say more, but I can't figure out anymore synonyms for the word weird, since that word really was the only one on my mind the first time I watched the film. I wouldn't give this as critique for the film though, since it is a very unique one and the strangeness just made me more intrigued to watch it again.   The film grew to new meanings on my second watch. Firstly, I suppose I was more open to the film, since the first time I had been told that the film was difficult to watch so I concentrated too heavily to try to figure out everything that was going on, which strangely got me just more mixed up. I later figured out I was focusing on the wrong things. The second time I just let myself absorb the film normally. It was also a day, on which I felt melancholic. This was the perfect film for that mood, because disregarding the strange pace of the story and plot, the film really is about the tone. Charlie Kaufman creates a balance of sad and funny moments in this film - and also his other ones - which I love. It creates a very realistic and believable tragicomic melancholic atmosphere, which allows the film to take itself very seriously and really get into the pain the main character is going through, while also being genuinely very very funny. Like life, the film has a blend of funny and sad moments.   And that's what Synechdoce, New York really is about. Life and everything that it encompasses. The film really gets in to the meat of the subject matter. Despite being strangely paced and the way time is convoluted, the film is about a very simple, yet grandiose themes. Everyone can find their own meaning to Synechdoce, New York - much like in the Master - since it is about things that will probably touch everyone in some way.   Caden Cotard is also my favorite character in any film I have seen."
TrueFilm,3baotw,Sadsharks,7,Sat Jun 27 17:29:17 2015 UTC,"Synecdoche NY is also my favourite and I consider Kaufman not just the greatest screenwriter currently working, but also one of the greatest writers period.  He deserves fame akin to that of literary masters like Pynchon and DeLillo.  The first time I saw Synecdoche it put me into an existential crisis.  I was shaking by the time the movie ended and my body felt sort of hollow or empty.  Never before or since has a film actually caused a physical reaction for me besides crying.  But I didn't cry over Synecdoche; it's not a sad movie.  Just an honest one.  I don't know how Kaufman has done it but he has some kind of enlightenment.  He understands how people behave, he understands how they feel and how life really works.  Most importantly, he doesn't shy away from portraying these things with clarity.  A lot of directors, especially ones like Malick, have tried to depict the essence of the human condition in films like Tree of Life and though that's a good movie, I think Kaufman came closer with this film than anyone else ever has."
TrueFilm,3baotw,LarsVonThunder,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:45:46 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Kaufman is also my favorite screenwriter and if he continues directing, he may end up on that pedestal as well for me. You explained really well why I also love this and all his other films. He truly is one of the most honest artists in the film industry."
TrueFilm,3baotw,ampersamp,3,Sat Jun 27 23:29:11 2015 UTC,"I can see the elements of this film that may lead someone to love it, but in all honesty, I utterly detest this film. Finishing it I had this powerful, overwhelming feeling of revulsion at its darkness. It was just so completely depressing, but not in a way where the despair felt good or important. Grave of the Fireflies is a paean to human suffering at the hands of others. Requiem for a Dream is simple tragedy, where the characters suffering forms a meaningful message. Ningen no Joken, too, is deeply moral and Evangelion has a deep, beautiful hope in its broken humanity. Synechdoche has no such hope, no such message for me. It left me with nothing but despair and I hate it for that."
TrueFilm,3baotw,LarsVonThunder,3,Sat Jun 27 18:33:38 2015 UTC,"I completely understand, but the grey, depressing, hopeless ending is invenitable for the film and fits perfectly, since it's invenitable for us all. No one can escape death, it comes to everyone and that is the point. The film is a polarizing one, and I completely understand everyone who dissagrees with me."
TrueFilm,3baotw,pianobutter,12,Sat Jun 27 23:26:24 2015 UTC,"Kurosawa's Ikiru. Based on Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich, it follows a bureaucrat who is alive, but not living. He has forgotten how. An event comes along, of course, that sends him on a quest to rediscover what makes life worth living. It sounds so clichéd, but it just isn't. I haven't gone a week without thinking about poor Watanabe since first seeing it five years ago.  It's Kurosawa, so visually it's beautiful. Watching the film I feel more alive than I often feel trying to live my own life. Toyo's laugh, the romantic novelist, ""Life is Brief""--and of course Takashi Shimura's acting makes it worth watching on its own. Like a beautiful painting or piece of music, my appreciation of Ikiru grows every time I re-experience it."
TrueFilm,3baotw,ampersamp,4,Sat Jun 27 18:07:34 2015 UTC,"The third (fourth?) act of Ikiru turns it from a touching story of a man trying to make a difference, into something very direct and pointed. I enjoyed Ikiru immensely up to that point, but the scenes following his death turn it into something far more powerful. It probably edges out Rashomon for my favorite Kurosawa."
TrueFilm,3baotw,ReefaManiack42o,4,Sat Jun 27 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"Oh man! I'm excited to watch this now, I read The Death of Ivan a couple winters ago and it changed my entire perspective on life, its by far my greatest story and I consider it a masterpiece of humanity, can't wait to see this film now!

Naomi Watts incredible performance, the music, from Badalamenti's score to the use of 50s hits, the cinematography, the dreamlike atmosphere, the mysterious structure. Everything. I've been studying it since I first saw it in 2003, and I still don't know if I have figured everything out (but I think so.) It's just a masterpiece, beautiful, scary, deeply tragic, sensuous, amazing!"
TrueFilm,3baotw,MixtapeNostalgia,63,Sat Jun 27 21:51:22 2015 UTC,"The Tree of Life  It continues to resonate unlike any other work of art and indeed inspires me to appreciate the world, life, and simply ""being"" at all. I could say that about most of Malick's work, but I think this film is a kind of all-encompassing statement on existence, memory, family, love, and the fragility of it all. It was released during an extremely dark period of my life and quite literally helped me through it all and, as I continue with various struggles, it remains a source of inspiration and comfort."

I think it is one of those works that holds such truth and tenderness, that if you don't already appreciate these things in the world and covet them, you don't ""get it"" or just find the whole thing tedious. Also because of the immense tie to memory, it reminds me a lot of Proust. Something so still and precious and magic about our memories, about youth.. both Swann's Way and Tree of Life really captured this."

TrueFilm,3baotw,frakking-anustart,14,Sat Jun 27 16:22:24 2015 UTC,"My favourite film is either Persona or Ozu's Early Summer, but seeing as Early Summer is the lesser known of the two, I'll call it my favourite just on the off chance that it inspires someone else to check it out. I'll post my Letterboxd review, which sums up how I feel about this amazing film:  Ozu's Early Summer feels lived in, homely. Something about the director's gentle pacing and simple compositions allow the drama to wash over you; his style is simply serene. The characters Ozu presents to us are all stunningly complex, achingly human and subtly dignified. The conflict which arises between them is born out of kindness, a contrast which gives the preceding's a distinctly melancholy undertone. The narrative itself feels like an intimate exploration of the passing of time, observing the way 4 generations of Japan interact and communicate with each other. Many scenes simply consist of two characters discussing their past, and feeling unsure about their future; these little moments all contribute to a cohesive whole, a feat which few films can pull off. Ozu rarely moves his camera throughout Early Summer, but when he does, it's magical. I can't even put into words how in Ozu's hands, a quiet, imperceptible tracking shot can evoke a range feelings and emotions; a simple scene of two boys running away from home somehow becoming transcendent through this intuitive use of the camera. And then there's simply the strength of his imagery; every frame feels perfectly composed, creating emotion on screen through the simple use of blocking, light, shadow and setting. Ozu makes houses feel like homes in a way in which I've never seen before. The ending of Early Summer, just like Late Spring, is exactly the kind that I love. A quiet book-end to all that's taken place before, Ozu finishes his meditation on the passing of time, generational change and societal customs with a small moment of beauty; one which tells us all we need to know about the characters we've gotten to know, and the lives we've become a part of."
TrueFilm,3baotw,Somnambulist815,5,Sat Jun 27 13:54:24 2015 UTC,"Man, Ozu is certainly something, ain't he?  What is your Letterboxd profile name?"
TrueFilm,3baotw,watchitbub,2,Sat Jun 27 13:57:35 2015 UTC,Probably my favourite director of all time; haven't seen a film of his that isn't beautiful.  And here's me Letterboxd profile!  - http://letterboxd.com/lucasmccarthy/
TrueFilm,3baotw,Somnambulist815,12,Sat Jun 27 13:58:42 2015 UTC,"I'm a little late to this, but I have two movies that I usually call ""my favorite"". Hell, I change my mind on which one is better all the time:  Paths Of Glory (1954):  This fantasic peice of filmaking is very popular. Usually called one of the greatest war movies ever, it has the sort of root-ability of Douglas' s character and mixed demensions of those on trial. The shots of soldiers running through the barrics seem revolutionary to me at the time, like someone started filming in another demension. It isn't without its flaws but i feel the writing to be stellar start to finish. It's just short enough to have you on the edge of your seat but long enough to make hou feel like you fought in WW1. Ebert's review on the film focused on the final scene, which like he said seemed out of place at first but tied back around. This ending, along eith The Bridge Over the River Kwai (which would have been my favorite movie had it not drug out in thr middle) have the most gut wrenching endings ever. Watching the characters grapple with reality and thier minor thoughts and actions is eerie and beuitiful.   Waking Life (1999?): I first watched this movie last year, and have talked about it a lot sense. It isn't perfect either, but dives into the philosophy of filmmaking and how it connects to human life. It almost works as a film essay (but not as good as F for Fake)  but works well as a story with a central character and similar ideas. I found myself replaying parts over the course of the year, and I keep wondering why this movie didn't hit the big time like Linklater's other movies. Its the more mature Slacker, while still keeping the freaky animation Linklater expanded upon with A Scanner Darkly. And, of course, the last scene is as a real as a film can be, with the director acting and speaking his mind. Overall its one of the most thought provoking and well shot movies, ever.  To me."
TrueFilm,3baotw,gaspard_winckler,33,Sat Jun 27 14:00:59 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily believe that one's favorite movie has to be the best movie he or she have ever seen, however for my money my favorite film is also one of the greatest, if not the greatest film ever made: The Passion of Joan of Arc. The film fulfills the promise of the cinematic art form in a way I've never seen before, cutting out any superfluous imagery or story progression and creating almost a direct line of empathy between the audience and our heroine, its like watching ghosts at play. The film is designed to keep us with the characters' fear and sorrow and outrage, because if they can't escape it, why should we?  This immediacy and harshness creates a sense of horror, but there's also a great deal of compassion, even for the supposed villains of the film. From the start of the picture, Joan's prosecutors are seen in a harsh, jagged light, spurning and ridiculing her. And yet by the end, even we feel for their inability to understand or help Joan. And I haven't even talked about poor Falconetti as even poorer Joan. Joan of Arc might be the most fascinating character in all of cinematic history, which is to say nothing of the fact that she actually existed. There's so much to her in the film that remains an enigma; her stubbornness, her staggering resilience, her faith. There are many moments where we expect Joan to do the heroically rational thing to do, or reply to the prosecutors' condescension with a cutting reply, and yet she remains Joan, and it can be frustrating. But when she speaks to and of God, not as the abstract figure as the prosecutors do but as a friend, we feel for her. And when they ask if she knows the Lord's Prayer, and she says yes, and they ask how she knows it, and she replies ""my mother taught me"" we feel a great sense of mourning, as if we knew her mother ourselves.  And then there's Falconett. My God, Falconetti. Whenever I talk about this film, and I get to that performance, I simply tell people ""Look into the reflection of her eyes, and you can see God""  There's a commitment to character in this film that I simply don't know if I've witnessed anywhere else, almost like the concept of Ego-death, where the actor becomes fully self aware and becomes part of the story itself, not just performing in it.  I'm sorry for such a shapeless rambling, but I hardly get the chance to talk about this film. I truly appreciate the intent of this thread, and hope more people come in and get a chance to really dive into their favorite."
TrueFilm,3baotw,VaughnillaIce,4,Sat Jun 27 18:08:11 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you about having a favourite film that isn't the greatest. One of my favourites I have watched recently was Jon Favreau's 'Chef', nothing deep or profound, just a happy film about goof food. I really like your thoughts on Joan of Arc, seems like a very interesting film."
TrueFilm,3baotw,CloseToLightSpeed,2,Sat Jun 27 14:57:07 2015 UTC,"I guess I want to like more classic films, but most tend to fall into the ""good (or influential) for their time"" instead of objectively good and entertaining for audiences now.   The Passion of Joan of Arc is one of my go to examples of films that are engaging regardless of time. A silent film about a trial shouldn't work at all, but it's easy to get into this film. Anybody watching it should absolutely watch the Criterion DVD version with the ""Voices of Light"" soundtrack. It's an incredible piece of music that really enhances the film."
TrueFilm,3baotw,VaughnillaIce,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:45:57 2015 UTC,"Voices of Light is fantastic, something that stands on its own as well as perfectly complimenting the film. I do think that everyone should see the film in complete silence at least once, because even the music is sort of a separation to the reality of the film, it offers some sort of relief and emotional leverage. Its still a fantastic soundtrack, though/"
TrueFilm,3baotw,alterpsyche,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:32:54 2015 UTC,"I got real uneasy watching this film. The camera moves around during ""dialogues"", making it strange to really settle. I think that this does have an impact on the psychological strength this film seems to have. It also enhances the importance of architecture and decorations for orientation.  Just found this recently: click the small text on the box on the right that says ""DEKORATIONER"" (""Filmens dekorationsmodeller"") to browse through the architectural models used for the film."
TrueFilm,3baotw,Pseudo-esque,25,Sun Jun 28 04:43:03 2015 UTC,"I decided long ago my favorite film is Once (2007). It's about an Irish busker who meets an Czech immigrant and they make music together. This is my favorite movie because there are no underlying themes, no incredible special effects, no A-list actors, nothing like that. It's because it's just a movie about a few days in the life of a man, not unlike other men, who's doing what he can do get by. It's such an intimate experience. The music is amazing, and the OST will forever hold a place in my heart. The movie wasn't trying to revolutionize anything or attempt to win an award. This movie was made because these people really wanted to tell this story. I can summarize the movie in one word: ""Genuine"". It's just really something else. I don't expect other people to list it as their favorite movie, but it really is something special to me.  Fun fact: During the dinner party scene, Marketa Irglova (one of the protagonists) made all the food."
TrueFilm,3baotw,annus-mirabilis,3,Sat Jun 27 14:39:31 2015 UTC,"Yes! Personally, this is the perfect movie. It nailed everything I love about movies.  A lovely little movie about love, and even though it's almost a musical, it feels so real. The chemistry between the main character are perfect, and every time I see this movie, it tickles in my tummy just like when falling in love.  I can see this movie over and over, much thank to the great music. Never get tired of it."
TrueFilm,3baotw,monkeyd_ace,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:50:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly. You could feel that these people really had chemistry.  SPOILERS AHEAD:  I don't think it was a love story. I think it was just people making music. I mean there was chemistry, it was totally obvious it was there. It could've blossomed into something, but I think they gave it up for the right reasons (i.e. pursuing his dream/getting back together with her husband)"
TrueFilm,3baotw,SpentThatOnANecklace,2,Sat Jun 27 15:36:03 2015 UTC,"This film was a huge deal in Czech republic at the time. Obviously, because it won the Oscar for its main song, which is occasionally played in radios to this day."
TrueFilm,3baotw,lordhadri,29,Sat Jun 27 15:40:59 2015 UTC,"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is definitely my favorite. The score is absolutely perfect (""The Ecstasy of Gold"" is probably one of the most iconic songs originally made for a movie). Leone had an incredible ability to create rustic western landscapes, and the sprawling deserts only make the film seem even more grandiose than it already is. The only thing I'm upset with is the subpar English dubbing that doesn't always coincide with the lip movements...  The story genuinely feels like an epic myth or legend, as the trifecta compete for the treasure. The standoff at the cemetery is the most exciting climax to a movie I've ever seen, and the romantic portrayal of the values held and conflicts experienced in this era establishes a simple, all-encompassing view on the nature of the world and humankind.  But most importantly, it points out that people are not inherently good or bad, we are caught somewhere in between our morals and our desires. For this reason we are all made ugly from the hypocrisies we follow, the suffering we exchange, the gut-wrenching fear we hold for one another. We are all against ourselves, and few other films successfully embody this."
TrueFilm,3baotw,sludj5,6,Sun Jun 28 00:19:33 2015 UTC,"I love that film. When I first watched it I would have agreed with you about the dubbing, but now I see it as part of the story. Mistake or not, it adds an additional element (alongside the classic elements like a quest for treasure and a final showdown) that makes the film feel like a legend told over a night fire.   I can't explain it all that well."
TrueFilm,3baotw,HunterSTolkien,10,Sat Jun 27 14:57:31 2015 UTC,"My favourite movie is Andrei Rublev. I remember watching my 1st Tarkovsky movie: Stalker. I was amazed by the visuals but fell asleep. Tarkovsky wasn't an easy go. I was drowsy during Nostalgia (ending is perfect btw), Ivan's Childhood was nice (but not as good as the rest), and The Mirror, and oh shit, no amount of coffee could prepare me for that (it's now in my top 10). Andrei Rublev is the movie that made me fall in love with Tarkovsky's filmography.  You probably need to read sculpting in time, but it's already there--right in the title--sculpting in time. Tarkovsky uses an element almost forgotten in film--he uses the element of time to create, not a story, not a narrative, but an experience--and more than experience--a world within that experience.  The Middle Ages is ripe with good movies. I loved The Seventh Seal, many Shakespeare adaptations, Braveheart, Kingdom of Heaven DC, but Andrei Rublev is THE movie about the medieval times.  Most of the movies above are just stories that take place in the Middle Ages: they have their characters, their character arcs, the hero's journey, some history added in, some existential angst, but Andrei Rublev isn't concerned with any single narrative. It was about THE Medieval Ages. It was an experience--an exploration of Medieval Age life.  Movies often care too much about plot that they stop caring about their world. And when it comes to world building, most movies would rather have a pretty face explain the rules of the world in expository monologues (I'm looking at you Nolan).  The movie feels less like a story and more like a world. When I'm watching the movie, it feels like I'm a part of it. The Witches Sabbath, a cottage in the rain, the woods, the raid, it was an immersive world that no amount of narrative and exposition can recreate.  Movies are all about visual experiences. If we try to focus too much on narrative, we end up as poor imitations of literature. If we try to focus on acting and drama, we end up as poor imitations of theatre, if we try focusing on themes and philosophy, we end up as poor imitations of the Greeks and other great philosophers.  The Film has one thing over every other medium and that is its mise en scene (visual narrative).  As much as I enjoy the storytelling of The Godfather, the wonderful ensemble cast of Seven Samurai, the cool slick storytelling of Pulp Fiction, it is Andrei Rublev that towers above all other movies.  Andrei Rublev works above all because it is the most beautiful experience of a movie that I have ever watched. In an age where I forget about most movies a few months after watching them, when I think of Andrei Rublev, I imagine the bell ringing, the young woman that he once lost, shrouded in divine light, pregnant, staring at him, and smiling--telling him it will be alright--and with the sound of the bell, his voice comes back. The silence is over."
TrueFilm,3baotw,ericrohmer,18,Sat Jun 27 19:48:39 2015 UTC,"My favourite film is ""Three Colours: Blue"" directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski and starring Juliette Binoche.  I've seen this film over a dozen times in the past four years or so since I've first seen it. Binoche's performance is my favourite film performance of all time.   I feel like this movie was made for me. Every shot, every line of dialogue, it's all perfect."
TrueFilm,3baotw,SpentThatOnANecklace,7,Sun Jun 28 00:25:37 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way but about The Double Life of Veronique, which is one of my own favorites. But I liked Blue when I saw it."

TrueFilm,3baotw,sludj5,17,Sat Jun 27 15:26:17 2015 UTC,"My favourite film is End of Evangelion. It's a feature film which serves as a conclusion to the flawed but also incredible Neon Genesis Evangelion anime series. I love this film because although I've exhausted it's nuance and mystery with countless rewatches, its emotional impact and huge, mind-destroying spectacle haven't dulled at all. It's a well-crafted film, with substance, layered meaning and great visual sense, but there's really a certain 'holy shit' factor to it that takes it above and beyond all else for me. To me, the raw visual creativity and power in this film has not been matched by anything I've seen yet. It left me absolutely shook up and disturbed the first time, raising some really mind-melting questions and showing me, visually, some absolutely crazy shit I will never ever forget; there's a real, raw power to these images and ideas that has been burned into my mind ever since.   This film actually first sparked my interest in film form/technique. Since then, I've seen a lot of films which arguably show a greater mastery of film form. However, to me this film will forever be the pinnacle of spectacle, emotion and creativity in film, the ability of film to make you feel and think. This film is the best visual description of insanity I've ever seen, of experiencing something so beyond your comprehension it just fries your brain (it's an apocalyptic science fiction), and also the best expression of pure, epic beauty. The feelings in this film are very real and intense: horror, utter insanity, dreaming, redemption, isolation, etc; the characters experience all this, and so do we.   The characters, plot and themes are all complex and very satisfying to unravel, but the real joy of this film is in it's incredible, world-shattering, apocalyptic vision. The film is definitely flawed and I can understand why people wouldn't be as fond of it (self-important, too complex, swings wildly from expositional dialogue to incredibly subtle, really good visual storytelling), but I'd still recommend it and the series based solely on the film's incredible power and the tangible impact it's had on my understandings and direction in life. To me, it's perfect in it's creative vision and how it links up so satisfyingly to its intellectual pursuits in themes and characters."
TrueFilm,3baotw,PJonestown,5,Sat Jun 27 20:46:30 2015 UTC,"It truly is fantastic. Whenever I watch it, it has such a powerful emotional impact as to leave me withdrawn and contemplative for several days. From its excellent world building, to the characterisation and hard, grinding message, everything comes together perfectly. Even the mythos around its creation is spectacular, with the creator's outright contempt for his fanbase.   At the very first screening of the film, they filmed the audience entering the theatre and taking their seats, waiting expectantly for the lights to dim and the film to begin. At the emotional peak of the film, when the everything finally comes tumbling down, and everything is bitter, and hopeless and lost --- they cut in the goddamn footage they captured of the audience, and everyone is forced to look at their shallow vulnerable selves."
TrueFilm,3baotw,undergroundkris,5,Sat Jun 27 22:29:10 2015 UTC,"Dude, prior to watching Evangelion, I was on a major anime kick.  I burned through Cowboy Bebop, Gurren Lagaan, and Death Note like they were nothing.  Then I watched Evangelion.  After End of Evangelion, I couldn't watch anime for about six months.  It just absolutely fried me.  It is a mind-melter of a film in the best way.  It is a far cry from the rushed, cheap final two episodes they called an ending to the show.  I love Evangelion because it has the balls to do the things that really make you question and probe why characters are acting in ways that seem out of character.  The opening scene with Shinji and Asuka, for example.  Just...fuck.  It makes sense when you've digested and pondered it, but it is just so out of nowhere and unlike Shinji.  Even the ending.  I love how it treats the audience with maturity.   Even the ending.  The refusal to give a ""safe"" ending. It is interesting how the show starts off like a lot of other animes:  middle schoolers, giant robots, and aliens.  Then, as the series goes on, it grows more and more mature, darker and darker.  It reaches its peak in End of Evangelion.  Neon Genesis Evangelion has some of the most complex and real characters of any anime, as well as show or movie, I've ever seen."
TrueFilm,3baotw,ownererz,5,Sat Jun 27 15:11:59 2015 UTC,"EoE is, for better or for worse, one of the best character studies/studies on humanity and of life as a whole to me. Every bit of character interaction and meaning behind the convoluted plot all come full circle and the entirety of the last half of the film is spellbinding for its poetic visual depth and, just as you have stated, the way it portrays the human psyche when one is forced to evaluate himself and the situation that he is placed in. Masterpiece of a film and of a series as a whole, even with its flaws!"
TrueFilm,3baotw,JamesOCocaine,4,Sat Jun 27 15:22:42 2015 UTC,Evangelion is my favourite anime series I've seen. I love the depth and mystery surrounding the story. Is end of Evangelion the one where asuka dies to the angels? That's one of the most brutal animated scenes I have witnessed. One of the most brutal death scenes I have watched also.
TrueFilm,3baotw,sludj5,33,Sat Jun 27 18:12:46 2015 UTC,"My favorite film is Martin Scorcese's Taxi Driver. This is my first write-up on here so forgive me if it's a little rough.  It is, in my opinion, the greatest character study in any medium I've seen yet (beating out Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, Asano's Oyasumi Punpun, Ellis' American Psycho - all of it). Travis Bickell is a warped, misanthropic nightcrawler with consistently dark thoughts. He has flashes of moral goodness, but then he does things like takes Betsy to a porno theater on their first date and buys a bunch of guns and attempts to kill Senator Palantine multiple times. He's just completely out of touch with society.  My favorite scene is when Travis is driving Senator Palantine in his cab. Palantine speaks about how he prefers taxis to limos any day and how he feels more connected to the people when riding in them, generally good things to hear from a presidential candidate. Travis has light conversation with him, showing his appreciation for his campaign. Palantine asks him what he'd like to see changed in the country, and he responds with an answer that is an abrupt change of tone to the rest of the scene: a very hateful and uncomfortable dialogue about how disgusting people in the city are; how they are filthy scum, lacking any moral decency and how he wished the president would just ""flush the whole city down the fucking toilet."" It showcases a lot of his misanthropic nature and I think it's quite startling to watch in the context of the movie, where no real aggression from Travis is seen up until that point.  It's kinda hard for me to place why I enjoyed this movie so much but if you guys wanna talk about it, that'd be great!"
TrueFilm,3baotw,arcangel092,6,Sat Jun 27 14:44:08 2015 UTC,"Also, it has an AMAZING soundtrack. I love the way the brass swells menacingly in the scene where Bickell says ""someday a real rain will wash the scum off the streets"". The underlying music has a pleasant motif running throughout, but those brass swells unsettle you, and remind you that something isn't quite right; thematically it's a perfect fit."
TrueFilm,3baotw,sancheaa,6,Sat Jun 27 18:50:23 2015 UTC,"I love the brief scene where Travis tries to get help. It's exactly how I imagine a lone wolf killer would act. He just seems to be laughing to himself when trying to explain how dangerous and dark his thoughts are. Not some maniacal type thing, but just him realizing how futile it is to try to get someone else to understand."
TrueFilm,3baotw,amnnn,2,Sun Jun 28 04:23:53 2015 UTC,"You put a HUGE smile on my face when you mentioned Oyasumi Punpun. Inio Asano is a master at writing and that story in particular is one of the greatest that I've ever experienced. Although I have yet to see Taxi Driver, you did a nice job of painting a picture of it. I need to get around to watching it soon!"
TrueFilm,3baotw,HappyMattress,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:52:49 2015 UTC,The scene where Travis stares into his soda for a second longer then normal and the bubbling grows louder struck me as one of the best PTSD scenes I've seen.
TrueFilm,3baotw,OracleFINN,21,Sat Jun 27 14:53:00 2015 UTC,"Studio Ghibli is one of the most revered studios in modern animation (and film in general, I'd argue) and it's their best film. It has so much whimsy, but so much depth at the same time. The design is beautiful, the characters are fantastic, it's amusing, touching, and extremely sad at times. It's the perfect film, in my opinion."
TrueFilm,3baotw,JASON9818,6,Sat Jun 27 18:20:10 2015 UTC,"This is my 'comfortable' film. If I ever feel a need to put something on in the background, like when I'm studying, it's that. For that reason I've watched it over 50 times. It is just so 'easy' to watch, but at the same time is completely engrossing. A weird combination that I haven't really found in any other film."
TrueFilm,3baotw,Kyoj1n,2,Sat Jun 27 19:53:56 2015 UTC,"I personally didn't like it. The animation was tremendous but the main character felt inconsistent in her vacillating between fear and courage. I never knew how she was going to react or why. I also felt like it was an Alice in Wonderland ripoff. Just my opinion though, many people adore it so maybe i'm missing something."
TrueFilm,3baotw,sjarrel,2,Sun Jun 28 02:23:36 2015 UTC,"Spirited Away is my all time favorite anime. I recently had the chance to see it in theaters and it was glorious. The animation, the story, the characters, and the music all work together in harmony to transport the viewer to this weird magical (and oftentimes disturbing) world. I love this movie."
TrueFilm,3baotw,DrSmartron,2,Sat Jun 27 16:05:24 2015 UTC,Have you seen The Tale of Princess Kaguya? I just finished watching it today and the animation is refreshing and the story really gives you more of a chance to examine Japanese culture. And Hisaishi's soundtrack is a lot more varied and inspired than his work with Miyazaki (though I love that work too).
TrueFilm,3baotw,LancasterDodd,9,Sun Jun 28 00:32:34 2015 UTC,"Children of Men is definitely my favorite for just a ton of reasons.   SPOILERS  INCOMING.   For starters, the characters are fantastic. I relate to Theo a lot, and even after watching the movie more times than I can count I don't exactly know why. The coffee shop scene in the beginning is as close as I can get to explaining it. He walks in and everyone in the shop is watching the most recent celebrity drama unfold, so affixed to the TV that he basically just elbows his way through the crowd without anyone really noticing him. As you learn more about how apathetic Theo is as the movie progresses, it makes that scene a lot more interesting. I think that's the aspect of his character that I relate to. I feel that most of the time I'm just elbowing my way through the crowd, so to speak, that is unable to tear itself away from the constant pop-culture media stream. How his character develops throughout the film, for that matter, also just resonated with me. As for the rest of the cast, without going into it on each of them, in my opinion acted their characters excellently.  Second, the cinematography. The single-shot sequences are, I think, one of the most underrated aspects of the movie. No fast cuts, no quick pulls ins or outs, just one shot, following the character. I think it goes a long way to making the making the story line more believable. You're there with the character, you see the small moments of downtime between events that happen in real life, you feel the pauses that you make during the course of your day. More than that, I think they make the intense moments more intense, and the less intense moments more believable. The lack of cuts and camera angle changes almost gives it, in my opinion, an effect like the handy-cam movies, just better. You're there, you're in the scene, not interacting with it but witnessing it happen.  The humor. Again, its another aspect that to me makes the film seem more believable. The jokes aren't silly gags or forced humor, but are like the funny moments that happen in every day. I laugh at pretty much something everyday, but it's usually because a friend made a joke about something, or something funny happened. Not like the humor in the hangover (not hating on it) that's based on Zach Galifanakis's silliness. For instance, the interactions between Theo and Jasper really seem like interactions between two friends. When I'm with my best friend, I laugh a lot. But because we're good friends, we laugh about things in a way that isn't like laughing at Zach Galifanakis asking if Caesar really lived in Caesar's Palace. Also, there are moments that I guess you could call comic relief, but aren't overtly blatant attempts at it. When Theo's blindfold is taken off after he's kidnapped, the first thing he does when the lights in his face dim is stare open mouthed at Julian for a moment before saying, dumb-struck, almost in a whisper""...you scared the SHIT out of me."" Every time I see that scene I at least smile, not because it's blatant comic relief after a tense sequence, but because its comic relief after a tense sequence that occurs naturally. If that happened to me, and the first thing I saw was somebody I knew and who I knew wasn't going to kill me, yah, that's probably how I'd react too. The music. The song choices are just spot on. The scene I'd point to is when Theo is riding in the towncar to go see his cousin and passes from the shitty, filthy, rundown, chaotic, but real part of London into the inner area where the wealthy and government officials live. The transition from filth to people picnicking in green parks, (i'm pretty sure there's a zebra at one point), marching soldiers in battle dress on horseback in orderly files, is a great representation of the movie. And the Court of the Crimson King really drives that feel home. Its like the the Scarlet City rather than the Emerald City.  Its depiction of the future. I really like the distopic future genre and I think this one paints an absolutely believable picture of the future even if you were to take out the ""no babies being born"" part of the story. Particularly, the scene in Jasper's house where the camera pans along the last few decades worth of news clippings, magazine articles, and pictures that essentially document the world's dissent into chaos. The movie came out in '06, the year before the troop surge in Iraq, and given the political and international climate of the time, its understandable to see the progress of events in the film. The most telling comes when Theo and Kee and Theo break into Bex Hill and the uprising begins. Bex HIll is basically Gaza. The most blatant connection between the two, other than the the scene at the entry point (i.e. the border, which also documents some of the techniques used when handing detainees) is that ""intifada"" (arabic for uprising, or more specifically, throwing off) is spray-painted all over inside of Bex HIll, albeit slightly misspelled. In 2006, the year the movie came out, Israel lauched Operation Summer Rains into the Gaza strip, and the escalation of conventional war, fighting beyond bombings and sniping, really began. So when Theo and Kee see the intifada in Bex Hill begin, and witness the beginning of the ""fugees"" starting to fight back against the army that has been keeping them walled in, its essentially as if they were watching Gazans rise up against Israel. I'm not trying to make a statement about that conflict, but the connection is undeniable. That aspect aside, there are tons of other predictions about the future that the movie makes but are not overly overt. For instance, at one point, Theo is driving and the countryside is shown to be brown, barren, and basically dead scrub land. There is a drainage pipe shown dumping gross, yellow-colored waste water into a drainage ditch, while huge refineries and factories in the background belch smoke. The shot isn't long, and doesn't beat the point home, but its there. Another is the technology. Most things look the same, but there are bits that are futuristic. The holographic float screens at Theo's job, the photographically projected MPH and RPM gauges projected on a the windshield of a car they're in at one point, the motor-rickshaws that take up the streets in place of the more gas consuming taxis. Little things like that. Finally, the way the story is told. A friend of mine and I were talking and he said his parents had seen the movie but didn't like it because they thought it was overly, needlessly violent. While I'm not arguing that the movie isn't violent, or bloody, or have scenes that make you uncomfortable, I think that's the point. The violence that happens, isn't absolutely outrageous or unrealistic. When Julian is shot in the neck, she bleeds, A TON. The way you would if your carotid artery were suddenly torn open. It's not over the top, its depicting what that would look like. Moreover, the uneasiness you get from it isn't from seeing blood, its from the fact that you're in the car with the characters when it happens. The camera is situated next to her as if you were in the other seat, and stays on her as the other characters try and save her, only paning off when its clear that shes dead, as if the camera (and you as the viewer) are in the scene. Later, Luke shoots two police officers so they can escape. Again, not advocating it, but that's a thing that happens. There isn't a ton of blood, in fact there is almost none. You don't even really get a good angle to see it happen. Again, the camera stays in the car and Luke shoots them. The camera then shows the officers' bodies as the car drives off, and stays on them for a moment watching the car pull around a corer. The point isn't ""HEY LOOK DEAD GUYS"" its, ""I'm a character in this scene, fuck fuck, he just killed two cops what the fuck I'm fucked we're fucked"". The camera lingers because the characters' thoughts linger on what happened. As a third example (I thought a lot about this, if you can't tell, because I was a little offended that my favorite movie was summarily dismissed as ""too violent"" in a world where torture-porn as a genre exists) the scene in Bex Hill after the uprising starts. Lots of people getting shot, lots of them being civilians, lots of people dying. Its not trying to be all kill-everything-y, its trying to show how collateral damage happens. Theo runs into a bus that had been turned into a make-shift shelter. The people trying to kill him see him do it, fire at him, and some people in the bus are killed. Theo goes through the shock, so do you. That's the point. You feel what the characters are feeling by not having the grimier bits of reality stripped away. Later on in that scene, in the besieged apartment building, the soldiers are shooting from outside and more civilians are killed simply because they are there. Again, that's a thing that happens. The characters witness it, are presumably appalled, and you as the viewer feel the same. That's life in a place like Gaza, innocent people are killed. Again (not trying to make a statement on that conflict, because this happens in every war) seeing it is a way to make you feel just a sliver of what the character must be feeling at that point, and thus makes the story more authentic. The movie is based around the idea that the camera stays on intense moments as they happen, not shying away from the disgusting, sad parts of life, and is done in such a way that as the characters feel things, you feel a little of them too. In my opinion, that's the point of a movie. You don't just show a story, a picture book does that, you make the audience feel the story. A point which I think Children of Men fucking nailed.   I could go on more, but I wont. So yah. I really like that movie.  TL:DR; Children of men is great. Great characters, beautiful cinematography, organic humor, great  music,  awesome depiction of a distopian future, and tells the story in a moving, original way."
TrueFilm,3baotw,craig_c,8,Sun Jun 28 02:25:41 2015 UTC,"Repo Man is my favorite movie of all time and I've never fully been able to understand why. As I can best understand the first third is one of the clearest snapshots of the life of a street punk I have ever seen. I lived that life for years and it brings me back. It's not just the characters, or the circle pit scene, or the music ... It's like ... Everything else. That feeling lies in labeling all the products BEER or DRINK or CEREAL FLAKES,  the utter distain Otto shows almost everyone, or the hell of growing beyond your friends and entering life and finding it almost as worthless as nihilism.   More than that though for a movie about aliens, neutron bombs, time travel, and boosting cars it's REALISTIC. All the characters have jobs, you quickly meet Otto's parents (when in any other movie he would be a homeless punk stereotype), Otto is terrible at his job, and all the characters while wild and crazy could be real people. From the Repo Men, to the ska band, to the junkie punks stealing old ladies pills, to Miller the psychotic genious hobo everyone is simply to crazy to be fake.  Something about it is just painfully beautiful to me. I'm not angry that almost no one else can see it. When Otto is down and out and angrilly singing ""TV party"" to himself on the train tracks, I can feel that because I've been there. And at the end of the movie when Miller invites Otto into the time traveling-ufo-bomb-car and he smiles and gets in, I can feel that too.  To me, it's just a perfect film."
TrueFilm,3baotw,traceitalian,10,Sat Jun 27 16:20:38 2015 UTC,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the best romance movies I've seen. I remember tearing up watching the movie in a dark quiet living room. From the amazingly well crafted story, to Carrey and Winslet's acting, to the surreal tone, soundtrack and cinematography and overall theme of the film. One of my favourite parts of the movie is near the ending in the house on the beach where Joel and Clementine first meet. You can really feel the pain Joel is going through as he slowly loses Clementine in his memory."

I have a few romantic films on my favourites list, I think Annie Hall will always be my favourite rom com. No films has made me burst out with laughter at random moments like that one."
TrueFilm,3baotw,ReviewingJunk,23,Sun Jun 28 07:08:55 2015 UTC,"My favorite film is The Fantastic Mr. Fox.   There is just something about the snappy witty dialog that tickles my brain whenever I watch it. While that is something Wes Anderson is known for there is something about the dialog that makes it feel so expertly crafted, as if each line is the absolute and perfect response to the one before it.   The scene about the school yard ball game and the little song one of the workers play are why I love that movie so much."
TrueFilm,3baotw,happybadger,3,Sat Jun 27 12:06:09 2015 UTC,"I think that in that film the snappy dialogue really benefits from not being live action. You can do certain things with stop motion, or any kind of animation I suppose, that just wouldn't work quite as well in live action."
TrueFilm,3baotw,seanziewonzie,5,Sat Jun 27 12:07:48 2015 UTC,"My favorite film is 'A Face in the Crowd'.  Directed by Elia Kazan, 'A Face in the Crowd' stars Andy Griffith as a guitar-playing grifter who, after being discovered in a small town jail by a young and naive radio reporter, shoots to fame only to plummet down thanks to the fact that he's possibly the biggest asshole who's ever been on the silver screen. The parallels between Lonesome Rhodes, the talking heads you see on FOX News, and modern American TV advertising/politics/etc. is even more poignant today than it was in 1957, and proves that not much has really changed in the decades in between. Plus, it's worth the watch just to see Walter Matthau deliver a verbal smackdown that is one for the ages. Sarcastic, cynical and sometimes downright hilarious, 'A Face in the Crowd' is a thing of beauty. Hell, I'm going to have to watch it again right now.  Edit: Here's a fun little clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ4nqphP21k"
TrueFilm,3baotw,happybadger,12,Sat Jun 27 12:09:39 2015 UTC,My favorite film is Blue Velvet.  What I really love is the way the images are both incredibly beautiful and relevant to what's going on interms of story and character. Almost every single detail seems to have purpose and those that don't seem to feel just right. On a subtextual level no other film disects the american experience with more accuracy. The way the film subverts your expectations is particularly potent and really cuts to the heart of american values.
TrueFilm,3baotw,hoponthe,7,Sat Jun 27 15:25:26 2015 UTC,"If I had to pick one, which is hard, it would be Bergman's 'Winter Light'. One gets the feeling that there is something massive straining to get through between the cracks here, it's the same feeling you get with all good art."
TrueFilm,3baotw,jiggahuh,6,Sat Jun 27 21:41:25 2015 UTC,"Paper Moon, it's at times cynical and sentimental, sweet and brutal. Most people site over The Last Picture Show but PM is, in my opinion Bogdanovich's masterpiece.  I think it's a perfect film, one that I could watch endlessly without tiring and I'm not sure why. The cinematography is gorgeous and the acting is faultless, I also enjoy the film's simple unpretentious structure."
TrueFilm,3baotw,hoponthe,7,Sat Jun 27 20:37:54 2015 UTC,"My favourite film is Antonioni's L'Eclisse, one of the greatest stories about love ever committed to film, up there with Murnau's Sunrise. Vitti and Delon are stars in their own right, and the pairing here is nothing short of inspired. In particular, Vitti's acting works perfectly with Antonioni's exploration of existential angst, as it did in L'Avventura. The cinematography is inspired too—there's a lot in his shots to dissect, especially the use of buildings and vertical objects. Rosenbaum says it much better than I could, of course. And the end, like that of so many of Antonioni's films, is fantastic. The man captured 60s malaise better than any other filmmaker I've seen."

Now I've never been particularly fond of theatre, but the film is shot using four novels expressed through a Kabuki aesthetic. It's so obnoxiously beautiful in this regard, every shot interesting and meaningful and unique and strange. There's a lot of abstract imagery and symbolism and as a result it's the first film which really challenged me to look into the mechanics of the medium and others to fully understand it.  I've seen it dozens of times, the soundtrack is still one of my favourites, and it influenced a large part of who I am now artistically. Every time i come across someone creatively-inclined I try to convert them to it because it's such a stunning piece of cinema."

TrueFilm,3baotw,mellowship,31,Sun Jun 28 07:31:38 2015 UTC,"aliens is my favorite movie, and it's not even close. i love the alien universe in general, and aliens IMO is the best movie of the series. everything about it is perfect to me.  the special effects are breathtaking, even 30 years later. they used practical effects rather than CGI, so the visuals (beyond the cheesy '80s hairstyles and computer screens) aren't really dated at all. the atmosphere is so bleak and industrial, and it fits perfectly with the film. the cinematography is very similar to the original, but james cameron adds his own flair of course. and the score is just as good as the original's.  one of the most brilliant things to me is the way james cameron managed to pick up where ridley scott left off without taking anything away from the original or turning the sequel into a gimmick. he kept it fresh and original while still respecting what scott was trying to accomplish. the way he wrote ripley was very consistent with the way she was written in the original, but he added a new dimension to her character that we didn't see in alien- and it added to her character rather than detracted from it. ripley is probably my favorite character of all time for a lot of reasons. in an era of smart people doing stupid shit in horror movies, ripley is a beacon of sanity and reason. she's a strong, no-nonsense character, and she doesn't fall into most of the typical horror/action movie female character tropes. there's no forced love interests, there's no damsel-in-distress shit, there's no unnecessary sexualization, it's just a woman facing her demons.  but the thing that, to me, sets aliens above its predecessor is the mother-daughter storyline of aliens. the setup is simple- ripley's lost in space in a hypersleep for 57 years before she's found, and her daughter on earth (10 years old when she left) passes away while she's gone. when she and the colonial marines arrive at the terraforming colony that weyland-yutani established on LV-426 during ripley's hypersleep, she finds a young girl (newt), around the age of her daughter, as the lone survivor of the alien attacks. boom, connection established. they bond almost immediately, and ripley grows protective of newt. when stuff starts to go wrong, like the atmosphere processor (basically a giant nuke) beginning the process of self destructing and the xenomorphs attacking, she and the marines run, and eventually newt and ripley get separated. newt gets captured by a xenomorph just seconds before ripley is able to reach her.  from this point on, ripley is a matriarchal rage machine, hellbent on getting her surrogate daughter back. determined as all hell, she takes off alone into the alien hive armed with nothing but a few grenades and a flamethrower duct taped together with a machine gun. good news is, she finds newt. bad news is, newt was brought to the dead center of the hive where the queen xenomorph is laying her eggs. at this point, it becomes mother vs mother. ripley wants to save newt, and the queen wants to keep her eggs/children safe. i won't spoil the ending or anything, but from this point on, it's two pissed off mothers defending their children by fighting against each other, and the tension is sky high until the climax (which, by the way, produced one of my favorite one-liners of ALL TIME, and if you've seen the movie, you know exactly which one i'm talking about).  it's just the perfect sequel. everything about it is wonderful. i've seen it probably 50 times and every time i watch it i love it more. still gives me goosebumps to this day."
TrueFilm,3baotw,ReefaManiack42o,10,Sat Jun 27 17:25:04 2015 UTC,"While I love JC's  ""Aliens"", to me it is just so different from Ridley Scott's original ""Alien"".  To me, ""Alien"" is one of the great space operas, and really films of all time.  Allow me to make a brief, friendly apology for the original in the series.  This may be old hat on this sub, but ""Alien"" is much more than the way it was originally pitched (""Jaws"" in space).  At it's core it is a horror film, but the movie works as a metaphor for sexual violence using phallic and rape imagery.    The protagonist, Ripley, is portrayed as a ""don't fuck with me"" first mate, but she also represents the ""victim"" in the movie.  I don't really think she has a victims mentality, but hopefully that term will make more sense at the end of this.  So the exposition is done, they've arrived on the moon and sent the exploration party into the ship.  This is the first contact with alien life in the film's universe.  John Hurt is assaulted, and really orally raped by the ""face sucker"".  He is impregnated by the alien, which kills him in the infamous birth sequence.    The xenomorph itself represents the phallus, or the rapist.  Even the shape of its body, the elongated cylindrical head, the phallic second mouth that emerges when it attacks, is reminiscent of sexual assault.    It doesn't end there, the big twist of the movie has sexual assault imagery as well.  When Ripley finds out what Ian Holm has been doing, and that he is a synthetic, he assaults her.  He could tear her apart like tissue paper, but instead he tightly rolls up a magazine, which if I remember correctly is a playboy or something, and jams it down Ripley's throat.  This is clearly remanicient of sexual assault.  Despite how prevalent the phallic imagery is in the film, it is never explicit.  It subliminally plays on the viewers fear and disgust regarding the horrific act of sexual assault, and to me this is where the primary tension of the film comes from, deep down.    While ""Aliens"" is a wonderful film, it is an action flick.  They use humor and tense large-scale action sequences instead of intimate, close quarters, and frantic sequences that make the first film so wonderfully horrifying.  To me, ""Alien"" works better than it's sequel.  Don't even get me started on ""Prometheus""."
TrueFilm,3baotw,lordhadri,5,Sat Jun 27 18:25:00 2015 UTC,"i agree with everything you said about alien being a better horror flick, it undeniably is. the thing i love is that aliens doesn't WANT to be a horror flick, it wants to be an action flick, and it accomplishes that just as well (at least to me) as alien accomplishes its goals of being a horror film. cameron could've tried to make another horror film- but how do you make a horror sequel to alien without using the same formula? and in an era of ""always bigger"" sequels, how do you maintain the intimacy of the terror of alien while adding more? you simply can't. cameron knew he couldn't top alien at its own game, so he changed the game."
TrueFilm,3baotw,mellowship,10,Sat Jun 27 19:40:00 2015 UTC,"My favorite James Cameron movie. It's not that it isn't dated because they used practical effects, that's because Cameron didn't go forward with a half-assed production design. The sets build on what Alien had to make a unique used future look. If made today (it wouldn't be) their tank would look a bit better and the climax might not take place in the 80s/90s signature fire and steam factory. (Jupiter Ascending aside.) I don't care though. You can tell visual effects hadn't caught up with rendering aliens that looked fully real for a story that called for hundreds of them to be spilling out of the walls. This meant that every time aliens appeared they had to be shot creatively for maximum effect and many of the best moments in the movie are a result of that. Scott didn't do very well with this by comparison, and Fincher used a lot of cool POV shots to keep the CGI from getting too familiar. When I rewatched it recently I noticed how well the movie does at giving you the impression that aliens are all over the place without actually showing them for very long. And of course those silent segments near the end are magic.   I also like Fincher's movie but I agree, it's the best Alien-related movie by a mile and a very rare masterpiece of blockbuster-style filmmaking."

It's a period drama of manners, an epic journey film, a coming-of-age tale, a romance with two semi-tragic love stories, a fantasy, and of course a badass martial arts movie. The fight scenes, which still put me on the edge of my seat due in large part to Tan Dun's amazing score, are almost all primed by the relational history of the characters fighting. There are almost no ""good guy vs. bad guy"" fight scenes. It's always complicated. When the film ends, I always feel like I've gone on a journey, and it never fails to move me, even though I've seen it many times."

TrueFilm,3baotw,Devilb0y,6,Sat Jun 27 17:37:57 2015 UTC,"Watch the Master again with my interpretation in mind: Peggy and Lancaster are in a Master/Slave sexual relationship. Peggy is the true author of the Cause and uses her charismatic and charming slave as a figurehead. Dodd, in public, is fake; Dodd in private is a brilliant handler of trauma in it's infinite forms. As the move progresses, however, Dodd is losing the battle that he's helping others fight. He's becoming the public Dodd in his mind, hence more pictures and photographs.   Freddie's in a different version of the same battle. Same cage, different situation. He runs wild, the source of his trauma ambiguous (ptsd? incest? a combo?). He's losing the battle to his trauma as Dodd loses his battle to Peggy. The last scene is the one of the most frightening things I've ever seen; Dodd appears to have gone insane.  Peggy, after chasing her slave around the whole movie, actually gets up and leaves the room. Dodd sings genuinely at first, but the second time he sings it sounds forced, like Peggy ordered him to do it and might be listening outside the door. Whether she is or not is irrelevant. What matters is that Dodd sings out of fear. The Master has won.  The movie is an inkblot, and anyone that disagrees with me isn't wrong. The handjob scene in the bathroom is the strongest piece of evidence to support my interpretation.  Dodd looking in the mirror, on the slow boat to china, becoming the phony reflection. As a fellow obsessive of this movie, what do you think?"

Damn near every scene involves or mentions it, they even toast ""to the poison"". But what really made me think that the movie is about the attempted mastering of addiction, was not in the film, it was that Hoffman broke his abstinence from alcohol at the wrap party with a glass of champagne... Had he come to believe he too could master his addiction? Who knows, and like you said, its rife for interpretation, definitely my favorite film as well."

I say the movie is an inkblot because the evidence for my interpretation isn't definitive. I think it's MORE grounded in evidence than other interpretations out there, but ultimately I'm basing my interpretation on facial expressions and tone of voice. Nothing definitive about that.  For example, to argue against my own interpretation, Dodd could simply just be singing to a close friend that he misses. It's the way he sings it, and the lyrics, and the fact that Peggy leaves, and the gigantic window behind him (which to me symbolizes the presence that Peggy now occupies in his mind) that makes me feel that he's crazy, or is on the way toward becoming crazy. But none of those pieces of evidence are unambiguous.  I just get really worked up when the movie is discussed because I'd never heard my interpretation talked about before, not the reviews in papers or on the internet, and felt that people might find it interesting."

About a Boy.  It is PERFECT storytelling.  All of the characters are real, well acted (especially Hugh Grant's character, surprisingly), and they weave together to tell a really heartwarming and surprisingly complex story full of depth and substance.

That immediate realization has never happened before, so I've felt confident in calling it my favorite.  This movie had everything, comedy, romance, action, gore, philosophy, thrill, music, characters, story, great camerawork, originality, and so on. Normally, when a movie reaches for the stars it only gets halfway before crashing and burning, but this movie blended so much, so well that it astounds me.

It's a lesson in how to make a perfect action movie, from an era that was packed full of great ones. The pacing is spot-on, the characters are all instantly memorable and well-acted and it goes in a completely different direction to the first film, building on the excellent work that Ridley Scott did in Alien but offering it's own unique take on the franchise. It's relentlessly exciting; I don't think I've ever seen another film that flies by as fast. The scenes hammer on from one to the next as what starts as a bad situation gets worse and worse until you're clinging on by your fingertips as Ripley battles the Alien Queen in a collapsing power station set to self-destruct. It's a film that grabs the viewer by the scruff of the neck and hurls them into the fight along with it's protagonists.  It's stood the test of time and will continue to shine as one of the greatest action movies of all time and James Cameron's best work."

Is a favorite the one that knocks the wind out of you and you can't bear to see it again? Or is the one you can gleefully watch over and over. I was always shifting and changing, until I saw the film Beginners.  It's not a movie you watch for effects, for a complex plot, and far reaching locations. It is simply a beautiful story about a Father and Son, and the ways our parents lives and emotions bleed into our own.  The music, locations, interesting use of graphics and non-linear structure, and most especially the performances, all come together that is so simply sublime and heartwrenching.   If you haven't seen it, you should watch it purely for Christopher Plummer's Academy Award winning performance. He is enchanting. Ewan McGregor gives a performance so still and subtle, you are drawn into his world and you feel his every ache of grief and every flutter of new love.  The non-linear structure allows to see a father falling in love with another man for the first time after coming out in his old age, intercut with that man's son falling in love, figuring out relationships, and dealing with the grief of that same Father's death.   I could go on and on but I will just say watch it. The fact that it is based on the director's life (Mike Mills), when his father came out in his 70's, makes it truly something special."

Firstly, I really don't thing it is a work of genius (that would be Clockwork orange and Godfather for me) but for some reason beyond my understanding I cannot take my eyes of this film.  The cast is incredible and so is the acting. I love the atmosphere of constant tension from the beginning untill the end. It really doesn't look like anything is happening in the film, just undetermined tension, serious glances and occasional argument but underneath all that is a huge problem going on and it is unveiling before the eyes of characters and audience as well.  Maybe I like it because I was interested in the financial crysis at the time, maybe it is my affection towards J. C.

It wowed me more than almost any CGI ever has.  They used 15,000 Soviet infantry and 2 thousand cavalry to film some of those shots."
TrueFilm,3baotw,DaGanzi,3,Sat Jun 27 16:07:38 2015 UTC,"Of my top 5 films, 4 have already been mentioned in this thread. Clearly I need to shore up my cred with some more obscure stuff /s.  Top 5:   The Tree of Life (Malick) Ikiru (Kurosawa) The End of Evangelion (Anno) Bleu (Kieslowski) The Act of Killing (Oppenheimer)   So I'll talk about the one that hasn't been mentioned yet, Joshua Oppenheimer's 2012 documentary, The Act of Killing. Intended to shed some light on the brutal hunting and killing of communists following the failure of a coup in mid sixties Indonesia, Oppenheimer had difficulty getting any of the victims to appear on frame, with the perpetrators of the massacre still retaining government roles. Proud of their exploits, it is the bravado of the killers themselves which fills the screen, as Oppenheimer agrees to direct a film that in their mind would mythologise their actions. What results is, in my mind, the greatest documentary film to date, and it is as important a reconsideration of the genre, as it is a political juggernaut in Indonesia.   In the traditional mold, a documentary would fill out the details of the story with interviews, pin down the characters involved so we can safely judge them from a distance. Departing from this, Killing forces the perpetrators to overconfidently inhabit the roles of their victims, while never letting us forget the terrible underlying humanness behind all of them. If it were a narrative film, The Act of Killing would be the best character study I've seen. It makes for a powerful statement, and being so completely real, it's a statement we can not easily look away from.  Oppenheimer, Herzog and Errol Morris had one of the best AMA's on this site, here. I'll put an excerpt from one of Oppenheimer's answers below:   ...he asks to see the scene where he is strangled with wire. But then, he calls in his grandchildren, using them almost as human shields. He tells them - and wants to reassure himself - that it’s “only a movie”. They get bored because, indeed, for them it is only a movie. They go back to sleep. Now he is naked, without the protection of his grand children, without his shields, as it were. He makes a final effort to convince himself that it’s only a movie, by offering me a generic confession: “Now, I feel the same as my victims.” He hopes I will accept - and that I will confirm to him - that there is no difference between the fiction scenes and the horrible reality he is attempting to tame by making them. He is hoping I will agree that there is no difference between acting and dying, and I cannot do that. And I think this is evidence that my goal was never Anwar’s redemption, for if it were I would surely have felt that finally he has given me the confession that I was waiting for all this time, and I would have accepted that he feels like his victims. But when I say “no”, he is forced to deal with the fact that he will never be able to escape the horror of what he has done, he will never escape the horror of his past."

TrueFilm,3baotw,DanielOnFilm,6,Sat Jun 27 16:43:20 2015 UTC,"Taxi Driver(1976) is my all-time favorite. You have a man-Travis Bickle-who is completely alone in New York City. An insomniac in a place of 9 million people but 0 to turn to, 0 to trust. The only interaction he seems to get is with the scum of the city's nightlife and his fellow cab drivers. All of this turning him into a walking, talking time-bomb in the heart of Manhattan.   This movie uses its time period to its advantage. The 70's, when New York City was practically a jungle. I've never been to the place, but while watching this film I feel like I'm there. As if I'm a helpless witness who can do nothing but watch this man slowly lose his grip on reality. I am not just an audience member, I am a bystander to this man and his actions.  The movie has nothing short of great performances. One of those being a 12 year-old Jodie Foster. Who I can safely say puts on one of the best child performances I have seen, along with Robert De Niro who has the best performance in the whole movie. Scorsese chooses his actors well. Not only that, but he definitely knows how to get the most genuine performances out of each actor he works with.  Another thing Scorsese is good with is atmosphere. This movie has a subtle, dark undertone that builds up throughout the film, finally rearing its ugly head at the end of the movie. As previously stated, this and many other factors turns you from an audience member, to some helpless bystander that can do nothing but witness the consequences of Travis's degrading mental health unfold.   It turns a movie like Taxi Driver into an experience."
TrueFilm,3bbcg4,danielaraujo1783,20,Sat Jun 27 16:18:53 2015 UTC,"Nice review. In my opinion, Charlize Theron stole the spotlight as Furiousa. I actually thought her character development was done quite well; in a way which was subtle and allowed for the audience to infer certain details about her (Ironically I found Tom Hardy's Max to be somewhat lacking in terms of character development). While she is introduced as a 'badass' warrior archetype, the film eventually reveals her status as a maternal figure to the rest of her road crew.   I also found the feminist bent in the film to be interesting as well. The use of 'mother's milk' and the particular scene in which Max uses it to wash his face after killing some baddies seems to make some pretty clear statements regarding feminism and motherhood.   One more thing - Nicolas Hoult was great as Nux, and was probably my favorite character in the movie. His performance reminded me a lot of the weirdos you see in the game Borderlands. Their strange, endearing insanity as well as their jargon made this film so fun to experience."
TrueFilm,3bbcg4,pacificnwsoldier,7,Sun Jun 28 04:11:35 2015 UTC,"I'll point out here two of my favoueite parts of the film:  1) Characters. Nux is hands-down the best character in this movie. He breathes the most life into the movie, and I guarantee the most quotable of characters (Oh what a day, What a LOVELY DAY!). He actually manifests a franchise out of a simple character. That alone is beyond respectable.  Furiosa from the beginning is our protagonist. She leads the story, and has the greatest character development of the film. She has purpose, and drive (literally AND figuratively), and gives us a 'team' to root for.  Between these two, we barely even recognize the titular character, Max himself. The movie isn't about him, and that's AWESOME. The originals weren't about him either. They were all about the world they created.  2) Spectacle. Beyond anything else, this was a Summer Blockbuster. And I haven't seen action set pieces this amazing in almost/for a decade. Easily my action movie OF the decade. Scenes which many will forget remain frozen in my conscience. Furiosa sniping bandits out of the top of the truck while flying through the canyons, as they fly towards them on motorcycles, throwing grenades. I mean, just read that sentence again. And that's one of the more TAME scenes of the movie. Forget the sandstorm scene, or the salt flats scene. Both of which are relatively short,but breathe so much life into the world/environment. These are scenes you LOVE, but forget. The spectacle that remains are the subtler scene, in which characters and environment are built equally. THAT is the true spectacle.  Anyways. I can proudly say this movie gave me reason to see action setpiecea in theater again, and.gave me hope that buying movie tickets for good movies, is actually, really worth it.  A solid 10/10 from me, for being a damn enjoyable flick, AND giving me reason to buy movie tickets in the future."

Borderlands was very much inspired by Mad Max. It's much more wacky of a post apocalyptic game than Fallout. Very colourful, insane, and oddly happy.

TrueFilm,3bbcg4,otherpeoplesmusic,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:13:07 2015 UTC,"I interpreted the mother's milk as providing a sort of cleansing/purification for Max. In my view it consolidated Max's role as one of Furiosa's figurative 'children'. Honestly it is a very brief moment in the film, so I'm probably stretching here. But I found it interesting nonetheless. Instead of using water, he is essentially baptized by the milk."
TrueFilm,3bbcg4,pacificnwsoldier,2,Wed Jul 1 01:59:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting read.   I'd say you're probably stretching, but it's possible.   With that kind of mindset, is that the reason Furiosa is spraying down the brides with water when they're first introduced? Some sort of cleansing / baptism metaphor? Cause it looked like a swimwear commercial, to me, and I've been unable to find a reason for introducing them that way."
TrueFilm,3bbcg4,otherpeoplesmusic,2,Wed Jul 1 05:11:47 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that the metaphor applies to the women, only to Max. As an audience, we can already infer that Furiosa and the wives share some kind of special, sisterly bond. They are trying to escape the clutches of a morally decadent paternal figure. Max was an outsider who initially had to prove that he could be trusted among the women. So I'd agree with you, the wives were probably introduced that way for sex appeal.   But when you juxtapose that scene with the one with Max, it makes it all the more interesting. Why didn't the director just replace the milk with water? It would make more sense for Max to wash his face with water but instead there was a conscious decision for the scene to be shot with milk. I suppose that's why this seemingly insignificant scene kind of stuck out to me."

TrueFilm,3bbcg4,otherpeoplesmusic,2,Wed Jul 1 08:35:28 2015 UTC,"Liquids are obviously important to the Mad Max universe. Gas and water are the main two. Lack of gas is obviously what sparked the whole franchise off. Then the lack of water plays a large role in this film. Immortan Joe has power over everybody with his control of water. Control over these liquids in the Mad Max universe gives people power.  And then Miller adds another one, a very female one, that only women have the power to make. Considering the other themes in the film, I don't think it's just co-incidence. Women feeling powerless and trying to escape and be seen as human. But they have a very special sort of power of their own, over children and life, that no man can replicate (at least in Mad Max universe). I don't think I've quite got the full idea of what he was trying to say, I'll need to think about it some more, but I'm pretty sure there is something there."
TrueFilm,3bbcg4,xNeweyesx,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"But they have a very special sort of power of their own, over children and life, that no man can replicate   You've touched on that point beautifully. Despite their constant oppression, the women ultimately have a greater power over the men dictated by nature. I wish Miller could have touched on those themes a bit more, but the film was meant to be a Hollywood blockbuster foremost so its understandable that deeper social commentaries were left out.   Another thing I found to support this theme were the war boys. In a lot of ways, they reminded be of the Lost boys from Peter Pan; a group of misguided youngsters w/o parents or mothers who follow blindly in the footsteps of the 'alpha male' (Immortan Joe). At the end of the movie, Furiousa and the wives are elevated on a lift by the youngest of the war boys. In turn, Max disappears into the crowd. Could this be a statement on the acceptance of motherhood over male figures? The collapse of misogyny and machismo? I really hate to over analyze these things but I think the way Miller subtly inserted these types of imagery was pretty damn cool nonetheless."
TrueFilm,3bbcg4,pacificnwsoldier,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:11:26 2015 UTC,"I think my favorite aspect of this movie is that it is both over-the-top (flaming guitars, a truck with porcupine spikes on it, men spraying silver paint in their mouth before death) and subtle (little dialogue, gestures of the main characters say a lot, using visual storytelling to its fullest)."
TrueFilm,3bcwq2,LancasterDodd,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:56:24 2015 UTC,"It has one incredible sequence that I recently paid respect to. These soldiers guarding a bridge checkpoint, you see how mundane their war is, long shot point of views that bring to mind neo-real and it's awakening of the eyes inside of the screen. They're just standing there, waiting and looking as the day and people pass by. And a giant scorpion on the ground succumbs to an army of ants tearing away at it. Sarabande plays all the while over the yellow drenched scene, a soldier smiles with a video camera over what he's becoming a part of. That alone is reason to remember the film despite the general missteps you get with De Palma. Poor acting, poor dialogue, confused pacing. He always does at least one thing so great you can't help but appreciate him and hope he continues.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04jBIZO5CkY"
TrueFilm,3ba63t,pistolpierre,36,Sat Jun 27 06:32:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it isn't acceptable to have some sexual arousal in a film.  Take, for example, this scene from Top Gun is obviously titilating.  It certainly can be a thing that filmmakers strive to achieve.  There is a difference, however, between titilation and erotica.  It's a mostly semantic one, but it's there nonetheless.  Titilation can simply be anything sexually exciting, but erotica by name is far more showy in the physicality of the lovemaking.  In the scene from Top Gun, it's deliberately silhouetted so as to reduce the erotic component to the film; a film like, say, Last Tango in Paris, is the opposite and is far more erotic.  This goes even further when considering pornography, which requires actual penetration with the intent to titilate (so Antichrist, though using actual penetration, is not pornographic by definition).  To answer the question of why is there a separation...I suppose it's simply because of intent.  Erotica exists to push the boundaries of the art form, to incoporate a part of human life that isn't often shown on the screen.  However, it doesn't exist in order to get people off.  On the other hand, porn is designed to get people off and is less preoccupied with high art.  There are some people, such as Walerian Borowczyk, who blur the lines quite a bit, but he's an exception to the norm.  Ultimately, these lines are all subjective anyway (exception for the definition of porn; that's a pretty concrete definition).  And there most certainly are erotic films on ""best of"" lists.  However, they aren't that frequent because a) there are very few that are exceptional (as often most erotica falls more on the side of exploitation films) and b) they often aren't as widely acclaimed due to divisive subject matter (not everyone gets down because it seems indecent).  However, Don't Look Now, Last Tango in Paris, and In the Realm of the Senses are all films that include heavily erotic moments but are also widely acclaimed as masterpieces (for example, they are all included on They Shoot Picture's top 1000 films).  I think when people set out to make erotica, often times they don't have the intent to make artistically significant works.  That isn't always the case, but it certainly can be more often than not.  Many films have erotic moments, but I wouldn't exactly classify them as erotica, because straight up erotica is usual only in exploitation film."
TrueFilm,3ba63t,afewthoughtsonfilm,7,Sat Jun 27 07:46:07 2015 UTC,"Besides, Top Gun is fighter jet porn through and through. Even when they're playing volleyball or having sex, the movie stays the same."

TrueFilm,3ba63t,GO_WILD_AND_PM_ME,4,Sat Jun 27 09:03:17 2015 UTC,"I think arousal is a psychological thing which has a physical response. (Although the physical response also reinforces the mental state.)  I don't see anything off limits about art putting sexuality under its critical eye. People watch movies all the time that deal with wrong or disgusting emotions, like violence.  A violent movie doesn't necessarily condone what it depicts.   I think people are put off by sexuality in movies because it's something they participate in on daily basis and because it's a private matter, where crying probably is not.  That's why violence in movies doesn't bother many people because they know ""it's not real.""  But having sex is real, especially when it's porn."
TrueFilm,3ba63t,BobbyZ123,5,Sat Jun 27 10:31:53 2015 UTC,"I've always loved this passage by Susan Sontag, she's talking about literature, but it functions with film as well:   Approving or disapproving morally of what a work of art “says” is just as extraneous as becoming sexually excited by a work of art. (Both are, of course, very common.) And the reasons urged against the propriety and relevance of one apply as well to the other. Indeed, in this notion of the annihilation of the subject we have perhaps the only serious criterion for distinguishing between erotic literature or films or paintings which are art and those which (for want of a better word) one has to call pornography. Pornography has a “content” and is designed to make us connect (with disgust, desire) with content. It is a substitute for life. But art does not excite; or, if it does, the excitation is appeased, within the terms of the aesthetic experience. All great art induces contemplation, a dynamic contemplation. However much the reader or listener or operator is aroused by a provisional identification of what is in the work of art with real life, his ultimate reaction-so far as he is reacting to the work as a work of art--must be detached, restful, contemplative, emotionally free, beyond indignation and approval. It is interesting that Genet has recently said that he now thinks that if his books arouse readers sexually, “they’re badly written, because the poetic emotion should be so strong that no reader is moved sexually. Insofar as my books are pornographic, I don’t reject them. I simply say that I lacked grace.”"
TrueFilm,3ba63t,toadnovak,3,Sat Jun 27 15:23:07 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with erotic films, but it's kind of a risky thing to do because for each person in the audience it either works or it doesn't. Normally I can engage with a film on some level regardless of what it's about, but if a film focuses a lot on eroticism and I don't find it erotic, then I have nothing to do but sit there and be bored. (I'm a gay man btw, so this happens a lot.)"
TrueFilm,3ba63t,WildlifeAnalysis,17,Sat Jun 27 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"Personally, I have a big problem with emotional manipulation in most mainstream filmmaking. There are absolutely films that are so sad they force people into crying or feeling bad when they don't want to. For me, things like 'its so great you gotta see it it made me cry' and Spielbergian sentimentality romps are essentially exploitation films in going after one thing and asking us to mindlessly follow them into the dark just to make us feel bad because that's someone's misguided idea of good filmmaking. i once knew a guy who called this kind of stuff 'masturbatory melancholy.' Pretty apt.  I think the flip side to this is something like Haneke's Funny Games,  which deliberately provokes us into feeling terrible but the point is not to feel terrible: it's to remember that it is only a movie and regain control of your own damn emotions instead of letting yourself get yanked around on a chain to weep at someone else's will.  Anyway, when it comes to arousal, I guess the fundamental problem with evaluating erotica alongside other art has to do with the fact that it is created with a deliberate end in mind: creating arousal. So as much as I hate weepy pictures, they (usually) aren't created with the definite goal of making audiences cry."
TrueFilm,3ba63t,TyrannosaurusMax,14,Sat Jun 27 07:45:32 2015 UTC,But isn’t that precisely why we go to the movies? To have our emotions manipulated?

I think it goes in the same category of violence, in that it's easy to use and to get a reaction from the audience.

TrueFilm,3ba63t,Fraa_Babbit,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:50:24 2015 UTC,"This comment made me wonder where the ""art"" is in arousal. If someone makes you laugh, or makes you cry, that is coming from the mind and heart of another person. Something in you is being touched by something in them.   But erotica most often is,""I found someone who's skin-shape is fun to look at. I'm gonna film as much of their skin-shape as possible and have people applaud 'my' erotic masterpiece.""  If someone could make an erotic moment out of people who are not immediately ""hot"" just by walking down the street, that would be an artist creating something that did not exist before. I think people would respond to that as an artistic accomplishment."
TrueFilm,3ba63t,MaxFischer9891,2,Sat Jun 27 16:30:05 2015 UTC,"I think eroticism can be beautiful, but not in creating arousal. If that's the goal, I see very little value in it.  And what you've described is interesting, but still arousal as a result is not interesting to me. It's like making broccolis taste great. It's still not artistic, just ingenious."
TrueFilm,3ba63t,Fraa_Babbit,2,Sat Jun 27 19:29:57 2015 UTC,"I think ""The Sessions"" is a great example of making something erotic for an artistic reason, out of two people who would not be considered supermodels or porn stars. Helen Hunt is a gorgeous and talented woman, and she's not a 20-year-old supermodel. John Hawkes is not an action-hero with ripped abs, and he's playing a character who is paralyzed for life.  The sex scene in that movie IS built to cause arousal, because the point is to show that sex IS beautiful and a wonderful part of the human experience. But it's placing that arousal after a genuine human connection between two people, and so the sex exists in the context of that relationship. The film builds to it. Used in that way, a scene with the intent of arousal can have a place in a story.  I think that a film who's ENTIRE purpose was just to arouse would leave the audience feeling empty and exhausted and depressed by the end. And the same would go for any other film that tried to play one note over and over and over throughout. (For example, I feel that Borat does to comedy what Porn does to sex.)  Also, I like broccoli."
TrueFilm,3ba63t,MaxFischer9891,2,Sat Jun 27 21:38:29 2015 UTC,"From what you told me, the scene's goal is not to cause arousal, but to show the relationship. As a means to an end. Never as the end. And I love me some broccoli. But it seems to be a very hated little tree."
TrueFilm,3ba63t,Doomed,3,Sat Jun 27 22:00:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, and Spring Breakers for example does it well. The Fast and Furious movies always find a way to introduce girls who may as well have walked in from the set of Spring Breakers, but Fast does it poorly. They're on the screen just for titillation, not for commentary. Spring Breakers may arouse you, but it also makes you think about the nature of the Spring Break experience and the emotional maturity of high-schoolers. The director could not ignore the inherent sexuality of beachside spring break parties.  Nudity makes people very uncomfortable, and even in other countries that don't ban nudity in public, it is ""not acceptable to bring one’s reaction of arousal to its natural conclusion"". In fact, it's usually illegal. IMO, this is a good thing. Otherwise people could get ideas that it's harassment directed at a specific person. And the cleanup would be a logistical nightmare.  Being aroused during a serious film is an admission of weakness. You're supposed to be objectively appreciating art, but instead you're getting caught up in something which (one assumes) has a deeper meaning.  I do think it's acceptable to do whatever you want while you watch a movie in the privacy of your own home (without other people there), so if you think ""bring[ing] one’s reaction of arousal to its natural conclusion"" will enhance your enjoyment of a film, go for it.  I don't think arousal (or anything more sexual on the titillation-erotica-porn spectrum you have) has been tried very much in serious films. It would almost definitely have to be aimed at the home market (Lucky Bastard comes to mind, although I haven't seen it) for the reasons described in your post and mine. And if film fans are a minority, those willing to really take an arousing film ""seriously"" are a much smaller minority.  Other than taboos, there's no reason to separate porn from art. If it does what it sets out to do, it is a success (maybe even a masterpiece, depending on how well it accomplishes its goal). Because arousal is incredibly subjective and incredibly taboo, progress in the art and criticism of it is going to continue moving very, very slowly."
TrueFilm,3ba63t,BrickSalad,2,Sun Jun 28 08:19:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's just about taboos. Many critics would not have an issue with erotic elements in a film, or even a film that predominantly focused on those erotic elements. Some do, and some have very specific ideas of what sorts of sexuality are legitimate in a film, and this divisiveness is probably part of the reason sexual films don't do so well on any best films lists that rely on consensus.  I think one of the biggest obstacles towards critical appreciation of erotica is that it's hard to talk about. Dialogue enriches our understanding of film and thus deepens our appreciation. But while we can easily talk about why a scene made us laugh or cry, it's not typically so easy to talk about what arouses us. Not to mention, there seems to be more consistency with the former than the latter.  As an example, let's say that one viewer is aroused by a scene with a dominant and aggressive female character, while a different viewer is aroused by a scene with a passive and submissive one. That's perfectly normal because people have different sexual tastes. If they entered a dialogue together, they'd probably both agree about a sad scene being sad, and if not there'd at least be a framework with which they could hash out their disagreements. But when they talk about the sexually aggressive scene, what could the first viewer possibly say to the second viewer to give him a greater appreciation of that scene?"
TrueFilm,3ba63t,hipsterparalegal,2,Sat Jun 27 12:17:35 2015 UTC,"Sex appeal has always been a big part of the movies. Even though many of the ""best"" movies may not be overtly aiming for eroticism, most films have plenty of sex appeal. Arousal is an absolutely legitimate reaction for filmmakers to strive for -- why shouldn't it be? The line between erotica and porn, or porn and art, is always fuzzy."
TrueFilm,3ba63t,Patrickhart123,2,Sun Jun 28 01:41:23 2015 UTC,"I think there's something to be said about cinema being used as a form of public entertainment, and erotica is such a private form of entertainment, that for a lot of people the acknowledgement of sitting next to friends or loved ones and watching something they either are disgusted by, or aroused by, causes them to be taken out of the entertainment factor of films.  My theory is most of America isn't capable of being privately aroused while in the midst of trying to be publicly entertained.  I think (if we are talking about erotic film in the porn sense) the reason you see a lack of true plot in these types of films, and just consistent images that get the mind aroused, is because it would take many people out of the desire to be aroused and their ultimate intention going this particular piece in the same way.  I think may erotic or titillating moments that are in what are considered masterpieces usually comes in foreign mediums because non-American societies are more comfortable with the idea of sexuality and arousal than we are. You have to understand, there's still about 30-50% of America that would send us back to the 1950's if they had the capability, and most of their acceptable forms of entertainment still reflect that."
TrueFilm,3ba63t,wmille15,4,Sun Jun 28 19:24:26 2015 UTC,"I think you're right that arousal is also one of those physical reactions controlled by emotion, next to laughter and lacrimation and probably also terror (and maybe also that shiver down your spine? I may have just written the 5 characters for an Inside Out spinoff [dir. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, 2017]). Because while each of these reactions can be heightened through an audiovisual medium, they can each also be evoked through literature.   Why are most ‘best films’ lists usually devoid of any erotica? Are there no erotic films so arousing that they are considered masterpieces (without crossing over into pornography)?   That's a thorny question as you've stated it. Do you mean 'erotica' as a genre, and why aren't any films of that genre considered masterpieces? Or do you mean that typical 'best list films' are devoid of erotic elements? I.e. would you count a film as erotic if it had one graphic sex scene? Because by that definition, I'd say yes there are erotic films which are considered masterpieces—Mulholland Drive for one is ranked 28th on the 2012 Sight and Sound Poll and can be quite erotic. And you'll find quite a number of critics' annual 'best films' lists with some very erotic films, including Blue is the Warmest Color, Stranger by the Lake, Nymphomaniac, and more I'm sure others in this thread will enumerate for you.  But if your question is about a certain genre of 'erotica', I'd first have to admit I wouldn't know which those films are, and secondly I think that if any film were devoted solely to making people aroused, not occasionally but relentlessly, then that film would be disregarded just as any film is that is solely devoted to making people laugh, to making people cry, or to making people jump in their seat. We don't celebrate films that push us like human buttons.  On another note, does anyone else find it interesting that we can only express 'to be aroused' in the passive voice? We can laugh and cry as subjects performing the action. I suppose we can 'lust', but that verb doesn't seem to entail our own bodily arousal."
TrueFilm,3ba63t,wmille15,2,Sat Jun 27 09:08:47 2015 UTC,"Surely many if not most comedies are primarily devoted to making the audience laugh, and are celebrated if they do?"
TrueFilm,3ba63t,Doomed,2,Sat Jun 27 18:48:08 2015 UTC,"There are indeed quite a few comedies which have attained standings as masterpieces, including many works from Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Billy Wilder. And I have to concede that, yes, these movies were probably devoted primarily to evoking laughter. I was wrong. But I don't think they're heralded as masterpieces for their humor. Rather, I think they're celebrated for certain methods of filming by which they reach humor. It's not that they make us laugh—you and I may laugh at very different things, and neither of us may laugh at old comedies at all—it's how they make a joke, and how they incidentally create something beautiful in doing it."
TrueFilm,3ba63t,wmille15,6,Sat Jun 27 22:40:26 2015 UTC,"The following post contains the ramblings of someone who has stayed up too late.     It's not that they make us laugh   I disagree. Comedy is not going to be the same for everyone, but that doesn't mean any one comedy can only be good by looking passed the jokes. Yes, some movies like It's A Wonderful Life and The Wizard of Oz are apparently universal, and receive acclaim as such. The most well-liked comedies are equally universal, perhaps because they hedge by including love stories or some other basic plot in the film as well.  The most-acclaimed films of any genre are probably going to be a consensus. You'll always find someone who doesn't think Seven Samurai is that director's best work. Chaplin's comedies are so well-known today because they don't rely on heavy wordplay, or specific parodies of anything less-well-known than, say, Nazi Germany. There is no language barrier: what could be more universal?  All Chaplin's comedies use misdirection. For example, the appearance that a gold prospector is sleeping in a bed with his head at the left side of the screen, when really he's wearing his shoes on his feet and his head is hidden under the covers on the right. One can continue with the other techniques he uses. They are all universal to the point that a child could appreciate most of them.  Unlike some films, I didn't enjoy Some Like It Hot for the cinematography. Most of the reason I liked it was the jokes -- the script itself. It would still be hilarious if I was reading it off a piece of paper. (The acting, for the characters involved in a crossdressing scam as they get acquainted with a beautiful woman, is also wonderful.)  I don't like how the film canon has a few comedies that are acceptable to bring beyond their low station in life. City Lights and Modern Times get a pass, critics say, because they're really about poverty, love, and working hard.  IMO, those two aren't as good as The Gold Rush, once seriously considered among the greatest movies, because they are not as funny. Chaplin's romance has not aged as well as his humor.  You allude to this -- the reason these movies get credit is because they bring joy and sorrow. But my favorite comedies are Airplane!, Some Like It Hot, and Monty Python and the Holy Grail, none of which have much in them besides comedy. How can a comedy be looked down upon for being a pure comedy, but a pure tragedy, pure drama, or pure romance be praised for the same reason?  Jacques Tati's Playtime, the logic goes, is a masterpiece not because of its amazing satire and humor, but because it is very experimental and most people don't get it. But this ignores the basic humor of the movie. There's analysis, and there's overanalysis."
TrueFilm,3ba63t,wmille15,2,Sun Jun 28 08:01:24 2015 UTC,"It's not that comedy needs another element to make it great. It doesn't need a big meaning or anything. It's that great comedy has great form—we love the way they deliver their jokes. Some Like It Hot does have an amazing script, those jokes are written well, but the reason we celebrate that movie is because everything in there is working to deliver those jokes perfectly, every actor, every line reading, every shot and edit. People disagree about this—Billy Wilder has a mixed reputation in the canon—but it's the form and execution they disagree about, and not the 'content', if that's clear. We're not really arguing about how funny something is. I laugh a lot more at Monty Python and the Holy Grail than at Some Like It Hot, but I think Monty Python and the Holy Grail is just not as tight of a film."
TrueFilm,3ba63t,TheJediCounsel,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:45:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like this boils down to whether we should judge a movie on its component parts, or on our reaction to the final result. I’m more inclined towards the latter."
TrueFilm,3balea,ajvenigalla,6,Sat Jun 27 10:46:30 2015 UTC,"One of the most interesting things about Munich is that, when you get down to it, it's a film with a very simple message.   But by daring to apply even the basest of sentiments not only to a controversial conflict but at a time when objecting to the methods of counter-terrorism was seen as unpatriotic in the States, what should have been a simple, moral message was turned into a subject of controversy."
TrueFilm,3balea,QuirkyGroundhog,4,Sat Jun 27 15:12:44 2015 UTC,"I've always found Munich to be one of, if not the most mature Spielberg films. It beats the saccharine endings he so often falls victim to. Granted, that's just perhaps his view on things, but they sometimes come to me as a sharp contrast to the film previous. War of the Worlds, for example, successfully built a movie on dread and hopelessness, and yet manages to undo it in the last fifteen minutes with action hero schlock and an impossibly happy ending.  But Munich ends ambivalently, with no clear line between good and bad nor any true conclusion for the conflict. Which is perfect to the themes of the film, that this kind of conflict is cyclical and can never end as long as both sides commit to maintaining it as they have done so far. His supervisor's (can't remember character  names, sorry) lines at the end: Why do we bother cutting fingernails when they just grow back? kind of sums it up to me.  The rest of the movie is classic Spielberg tension building and strong characterisation. The bomb sequences are harrowing and thrilling at the same time, very effectively realising the state of the characters' minds for the viewer. There is the much talked about sex scene near the end, and I think it's an awful experiment gone wrong. Ignoring it is easy, though, just like how I ignore the frame stories in Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List.  Speaking of tangents, I always felt like Spielberg has always wanted to make a 'serious' film his best film, but his talents as a filmmaker lie better with more blockbuster fare, for better or for worst. I think his best film is and always will be Jaws, but I'm sure he (and undoubtedly many others) would consider Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan better films. They're fantastic, no doubt, but both have these irritating frame stories and a bit too much sentimentality, considering the subject matter. Munich I think from a craft standpoint gets very close, but there's that scene and the emotional core is not as strong as SPR or SL."
TrueFilm,3balea,mrdinosaur,4,Sat Jun 27 19:30:45 2015 UTC,I always liked how he used Avner's sex scene with his wife as a way to demonstrate that his imagination was stained--something that was ultimately supposed to be an act of love became a physical act coupled with violence.  I thought it was powerful.

It's important to remember how you may have viewed it as a child; this movie, like most of the corny old bond movies, was really exciting and fun for me. Some of the scenes in Goldfinger were also very silly, I always laugh at the way Goldfinger dies and how fake it looks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHXevnoAciY"
TrueFilm,3b6pf4,cerca,11,Fri Jun 26 14:30:04 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Connery appears with a plastic duck on his head in the opening moments of Goldfinger."
TrueFilm,3b6pf4,SirPlus,17,Fri Jun 26 15:11:00 2015 UTC,"eh, the opening sequence with the tiny plane?  No gadgets?  You cray.  Also, octopussy/maud adams... one of the absolute finest Bond girls.  This was certainly one of the campier James Bond films.  But when you say ""oh Lazenby wouldn't be caught dead in a clown suit""... uhm, the whole OHMSS?  He's wearing the Austin Powers gear for most of the film, with puffy shirt and everything."
TrueFilm,3b6pf4,reptiliansentinel,4,Fri Jun 26 13:28:48 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't argue that Maud Adams was a bad Bond Girl.  She wasn't the most interesting one to me personally, but she's still miles ahead of the likes of the Rosie Carvers (LALD), Mary Goodnights (MWTGG), and Tiffany Cases (DAF) of the world.    As for gadgets, you're 100% correct.  It's not that the film didn't have any at all, it's just that this film put less of a focus on them (the plane and the wristwatch homing device are the only two that come to mind at the moment).  Whereas previous films might use gadgets to beat the bad guy or escape from a perilous situation, this one shies away from that and put more of an emphasis on Bond's ability to straight up brawl with his enemies.  Certainly not a criticism, mind you.    And as for Lazenby's costume, I agree that it was lousy.  The costumes were the lowest rated segment in my OHMSS review.  I suppose the reason why I'm more likely to give OHMSS a pass is for two reasons.  One, Lazenby's outfit is meant to be a historical outfit that we as the audience are meant to find humor in usage in a contemporary setting.  In contrast, Moore's clown outfit is silly for the sake of silliness.  I believe that the humor is meant to be derived from the fact that such an important man would be stuck with a children's entertainer costume.    The second reason I hold the clown costume against Octopussy is that surrounding Lazenby's puffy costume is an otherwise engaging and entertaining movie.  This film, in my opinion, provides none of that excitement or quality so the clown costume was just one more eye-rolling detail."
TrueFilm,3b6pf4,SandyRegolith,6,Fri Jun 26 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"I think the bit where he tells the tiger to sit was a kind of pop-cultural meme at the time: there was a woman on UK TV who had a dog-training show and she used to pronounce ""SIT"" a particular way, like ""SIT-TAH!"". She was incredibly posh and a bit mad. So there's a joke which is really lost in time. And space, if you're not from the UK.  To me, the most offensive thing about this movie was the central plot point about nuclear weapons and how the pathetic hippies in the disarmament movement wanted to take them away from us, at which point the Russians would kill us all."

TrueFilm,3b6pf4,craig_c,7,Fri Jun 26 22:15:09 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree with this. Octopussy is one of my absolute favourites of the series largely because of its unabashed campiness. This is the film where I see Roger Moore really reveling in Bond as he chooses to portray him and bringing that character out. You're absolutely right that it's a far cry from Bond in Goldfinger, but the character has grown and changed into something else. There's nothing wrong with that.  I also really enjoy the ending. Much like the ending to Goldfinger, this one has you hanging on the edge of your seat as the action goes right into the very last second. You can feel Moore's desperation as he tries to disarm the bomb and get the attention of the people in charge. The tension is beautiful, the suspense is almost palpable, and all of it is glorious.  It's not the height of action or filmmaking, true, but it doesn't have to be. Octopussy works because it does a good job telling the story it sets out to tell in a way that works for that story. It's fun. It's tense. I love it."

I can't wait to see what you have to say about A View to a Kill, because it is truly, truly horrendous in so many ways."
TrueFilm,3b6pf4,Sriad,6,Fri Jun 26 17:17:35 2015 UTC,"You know, your comment gave me some pause.  Truthfully I actually wondered about this before I even began reviewing these movies.  It's a very tricky thing, ranking movies.  Obviously you'll never find anyone who agrees perfectly, however more than that, a movie like Goldfinger was made at a very different time from Octopussy -- and even more so from today's Bond films.  They were playing to different audiences and had different objectives.  Furthermore, it's hard to weigh one more against another.    I really wish I could find it but Roger Ebert had a phenomenal quote when asked how he could possibly argue that X film is better than Y.  He basically says that they're not necessarily meant to be compared but rather each film should be reviewed simply for what it is.  So therefore I'm going to inevitably run in to issues when trying to review movies like this (that is to say, give them numerical values and rank them against one another).  Perhaps it could just be that when I watched Goldfinger, it was still fresh and exciting.  Now that I'm 13 films in, certain tropes and gags are beginning to wear thin.  Is that fair to Octopussy?  Not necessarily.    I suppose if I had to give a concrete answer, it would be that for me, Goldfinger had enough other positive attributes (killer score, superior acting, more memorable sets, gadgets, dialogue, etc.) that I was willing to let the duck hat, poor effects (see the video /u/cerca posted in this thread), and obscenely misogynistic tendencies go."
TrueFilm,3b6pf4,LastResortHumor,3,Fri Jun 26 20:34:29 2015 UTC,"I agree, the ranking is ultimately not important.  Having recently watched all these films myself, I completely understand the fatigue that sets in, especially once you get into the thick of the Moore era. Films blend together, tropes get repetitive, its easy to lose sight of the fun.  Especially when it comes to Bond films, there is an extremely subjective and wide range of interpretations of what elements of any given film make it ""good"" or ""bad.""  On any given viewing, your desires can change as far as whether you want to see as much cheeseball Bond shenanigans as possible, or a serious attempt at making a coherent film.  Suffice to say, I think watching every Moore film in quick succession is a horrible slog, and things will hopefully feel more fun and clear cut moving forward.  Trying to view these films through the lens of the time in which they were made is important to understanding them, and moving forward I think that concept becomes much simpler and less subjective.  For instance, I'm 30, the first Bond film I saw in the theater was Goldeneye.  I had already seen Goldfinger at that point I think, and bits and pieces of various others, but everything pre-Dalton is a cultural artifact to me.  Judging the films from the late 80's onward feels much simpler to me. I ""know"" what's good and bad about them, rather than trying to frame the older films through the eyes of a culture I didn't participate in.  To say nothing of advances in filmmaking techniques and trends, and how those contribute to how cheesy a film might feel.  Again, you just have to get through A View to a Kill now, which is a really astounding finale to the Moore era.  Its quite a debacle of a film."
TrueFilm,3b5rai,ronfrakkingswanson1,8,Fri Jun 26 04:53:58 2015 UTC,"You already appreciate his visuals so that's already half of the work done. I could watch Ugetsu and turn my brain off and I'll still enjoy the relaxing feel of the fog and water in the dark. It's like a fantasy world on its own without the boring exposition of most ""Tolkien"" fantasies.  Another thing to look for is feminism in his movies. I've seen only four, but all four--Ugetsu, Sansho, Street of Shame, chikamatsu monogatari--feature prominent casts. He often depicts women undergoing unjust treatments due to society at the time or gender bias.  Look out for every female character you meet: observe their actions, their reactions, their observations, their opinions of topics, their actual actions when faced with a situation, society's treatment of them, and where they are now.  Try observing your initial impressions of a female character (is she annoying, is she loud, is she a jerk to other women) and compare her to the peak of her character arc and you'll see there's always a hidden layer to his characters.  He is also a master of fantasy and Ugetsu is among my favorite fantasy movies. It's so subtle without being intrusive. It's basically a part of their world without needing explanation.  I'm not even close to half-way through his filmography but he's already among my favorites with Kurosawa: just enjoy the visuals, enjoy the world, enjoy the characters."
TrueFilm,3b5rai,monkeyd_ace,7,Fri Jun 26 06:23:09 2015 UTC,"A lot of great directors are great directors for good reasons, but its often worth considering how the canon was formed, especially with Japanese directors.  The canon is largely based on what was popular in arthouse cinemas in the 1950s and 1960s, and has changed very little despite deeper and better understanding by film historians.   Mizoguchi is a very old director influenced by a theatrical tradition of filmmaking who started back in the early 1920s.  Even a director like Yasajuro Ozu who started making films in the late 1920s had grew up obsessed with Hollywood films and was considered a completely newer younger type of director.  Then after WWII the even slightly younger Akira Kurosawa was considered an even newer generation and started getting attention on the Arthouse circuit, and Mizoguchi feeling he wasn't getting his deserved attention started making films aimed at international audiences not to get left out. At this time western audiences were mainly interested in period pieces from Japan and anything set in the present day got ignored, so tons of incredibly talented Japanese studio directors like Ozu, Naruse, and Shimizu were initially left out of the canon and some of them are still having problems establishing themselves with Western audiences today.  Mizoguchi also came at a time when Andre Bazin was praising American filmmakers like Orson Welles and William Wyler using long takes, and so Mizoguchi's style very easily fit in with the popular aesthetic of French critics at the time, but only superficially so, dramatically he's a completely different animal.  There are things to appreciate about Mizoguchi, but one should not think of the canon as being written in stone or that you need to like him.  His films have never really done much for me, although some film historians I admire are fans of his work. If you'd like to give another go at appreciating what he's doing, I'd highly recommend reading this article by David Bordwell."
TrueFilm,3b5rai,RyanSmallwood,3,Fri Jun 26 08:01:19 2015 UTC,"Great answer, also some really nice information regarding Japanese film (Ozu is probably my all time favourite director, and Naruse and Shimizu are high on my watchlist). I think your comment about Mizoguchi being inspired by theatre along with Bordwell's article has really helped me appreciate his craft. I watched Utamaro and His Five Women last night and everything just clicked; the elegant staging, the restraint and austerity, the bittersweet tragedy, all of it worked..  I'm not sure though if this is Mizoguchi's style finally becoming refined enough that I can appreciate it, or just me finally seeing the genius of his work. Going to have to rewatch some of those early films."
TrueFilm,3b5rai,RyanSmallwood,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:38:03 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched Utamaro and His Five Women yet, but I've heard several people name that as one of their favorite Mizoguchi films.  Naruse is one of my favorite filmmakers of all time, his style is usually compared to Ozu, though he has a much bleaker outlook on life and usually makes women's films like Mizoguchi did.  In his films you can see the potential for a lot of melodramatic terrible things to happen to his characters, but they rarely materialize, and its more about their inner anxieties.  My favorite film of his is Repast, which is about a woman who's in a marriage she hates.  But the conflict isn't so much what the Husband does, he's actually one of the better men in the movie.  She finds the marriage unbearable, and everyone just tells her how lucky she is to have such a reliable husband because every other man seems so much worse.  They never have any fights or real conflict we just see her inner frustration with her life and inability to change it.  Kurosawa, who worked as Naruse's Assistant director said his films were ""like a great river with a calm surface and a raging current in its depths"".  Some people who find his films too bleak and humorless miss out on some of his subtle, dark sense of comedy though, I think.  I'm less familiar with Shimizu's films, but Mr. Thankyou is a clear masterpiece in my opinion."

TrueFilm,3b3msf,THRILLPOW3R,30,Thu Jun 25 19:20:17 2015 UTC,"I love abstract and experimental stuff, and I really do like when films are weird but I just don't get films like this. They look basically like a kid got a hold of windows movie maker and just recorded a bunch of clips from around their general area and decided to call it a film.  I can't peel a narrative or even a feeling out of any of these, apart from the feeling that they're just disparate clips mashed together.   I thought myself pretty tuned into weirder films but I'd love to be able to ""get"" these. For you to call that one film your favourite film of 2015 is surprising. I'd love to hear you expand on why.  EDIT: Why are all ""avant garde"" films on Vimeo just clips mashed together with blending modes enabled? I swear maybe 1 in 10 videos in ""avant garde"" vimeo groups actually have a semblance of narrative or at least evoke a feeling. The rest of the 90% are just exactly like the films you shared."

TrueFilm,3b3msf,revy92,7,Fri Jun 26 00:32:40 2015 UTC,"well,  here is a great interview with isiah medina. here is another. very intelligent and insightful. here is a great piece on this cinema, largerly about medina but mentions walker and dixon barker.  here is an excerpt of blais on ""sunset"" (a screengrab of a post now deleted)  and yes there is no narrative. at least not to you. the narrative is their lives. and in the case of your viewing it is unimportant outside of what you yourself relate to. the reason you are finding other similar films is that there does in fact seem to be a small digital movement within these films. ive only posted the best ones here (imo). if you want my opinion, take a look at the ending of ""Berg's Fatalism"" (or most of blais' ""sunset""). the last 2 minutes or so are completely silent, yet i find the images are so exhilarating, it's like i am getting pulled through 3 dimensional space (also true w geoffrey kenners films). they cut and flash so quickly and dynamically with such depth, while all the while speaking out to something modest, something familiar. i swear when i watch the end to that film it is louder than any accompanying music could be. it is pure feeling. also, in the case of medina and galmard, they are v much philosophers in their own right. im sure to them, the films have very distinct meanings in some ways, as the concepts they are trying to articulate are based off of dense philosophy. the others, im not sure. but in each case, the films have a youth to them rarely found elsewhere. it's real and tangible and reflective of their lives. if you consider the old masters jfikelette is refering to, im sure not everyone sitting in a theater in the 50s/60s ""got"" those films either. decades later, they are more or less universally appreciated in any experimental filmmaking community. these films we are discussing now, in some cases, are a mere days old. nobody expects you to ""get"" them, and honestly nobody cares. i find these films full of depth and wonder. there is no narrative and they are not made for any specific audience (other than maybe their friends in some cases). you say you love other experimental stuff. what works are you referring to? do you have any of your own work you can share? cheers"
TrueFilm,3b3msf,THRILLPOW3R,10,Thu Jun 25 23:17:48 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the detailed response. I don't think there's no merit to their work, but I guess I do find more meaning in something with more narrative form. You seem to be pretty into this movement, so there might be a snowballing effect that causes you to be more influenced by them and I'm by no means saying that's a bad thing because that's exactly how I experience films, certain genres or even just things about films pique my interest and I fall into the little appended microcosms of that thing.  I have a few short films but they're not very out there as far as what this thread might elicit... if you do care to see them they're here (https://vimeo.com/gregaaronporter/videos), but they don't really reflect the extent of the type of experimental films I like.  So instead, I'll share a few I've enjoyed.

TrueFilm,3b3msf,revy92,6,Thu Jun 25 23:59:32 2015 UTC,"mm well i believe at least initially i was pretty objective about it and the reason these works resonated is because they are unlike anything ive really seen before.  there are many many narrative films i love, many narratives that experiment or have avant garde elements that i love, but when it comes to the avant garde like this it isn't something i necessarily look for. these films are very, very form oriented. they are exploring film form within the context of their own lives. so perhaps your expectations were ""wrong"" or different and you were disappointed to find no narrative or the usual things you enjoy about cinema within (tho one of those things should be images, and if you don't think these films aren't full of incredible images then we just disagree in full I guess. the ""blending"" in medinas films and in the new blais film is astounding).  thanks for the reply and the links, i promise to watch"

I feel I'm always playing catch up with avant-garde cinema, I love it but I can never quite deconstruct it as much as I'd like (though I understand sometimes it's best left to merely admire rather than get into the guts). I loved the kineticism of Alexander Galmard's work, the frantic editing of the second half really brought a new element to the film.   One thing I always wonder is if these kinds of film should be regarded as avant-garde documentaries? They are, essentially, aspects of the artists' personal world and where they inhabit, and display a quality of life they wish to exhibit. It really reminds me of the work of Paul Clipson, especially the collaboration he did with Grouper, 'Hypnosis Display' which felt like a beautiful document of America, but again I would hazard to term such work a documentary.   Personally I feel if you compare them to other avant-garde films like Dominigo Garcia Huidobro's Partir To Live, which has similarities to work like Alexander Galmard's work in it's non-linear structure and tone, you can observe the differences in it's focus on a form of fiction.

TrueFilm,3b3msf,Sadsharks,7,Thu Jun 25 19:16:05 2015 UTC,"I think it might be more accurate to classify these two filmmakers as being more international arthouse filmmakers than belonging to the experimental/avant-garde.  Not that there's necessarily a hard line distinguishing between the two, but historically there seems to be two clear trends that can be followed as separate from each other.  International arthouse films tend to be niche commercial films that often are financed  with the help of government subsidies and are often international co-productions that are generally shown at film festivals and then circulated to arthouse theaters in major cities around the world.  They appeal to a more specialized intellectual audiences, but still stick roughly to the format of the narrative feature film, even though they may be highly stylized and differ significantly in terms of narrative technique and pacing from more popular films.  I'm less familiar with the history of avant-garde and experimental films, but my impression is that these tend to be non-commercial and usually short films because they're often not expected to make their budgets back. Often they completely reject narrative in favor of more radical experimentation and re-thinking of what the whole purpose of the medium is."

TrueFilm,3b3msf,Beelzeballz,5,Fri Jun 26 01:53:25 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Matthew Barney, which is tricky since his material is generally not available outside of theatrical showings. Some of his work is on YouTube (e.g. the Cremaster cycle, of which part 2 is my favorite, and Drawing Restraint 9 ) but the quality is poor so it's a bit of a disservice. He's not exactly young/new but he's certainly modern and is continuing to innovate. In my experience, his work is best perceived as captured performance art, and sometimes I think of it as a filmed first-perso-view tour through real-world sculpture work. There is always narrative in his films, but it's tended to rely on symbols instead of dialogue. His latest work (check out the trailer and the many stills found via the links at left) is closer to opera so it has the most words/lyrics yet.   I think Barney's cinematic work is interesting since he ""reached"" cinema via a different path vs. most of the cinematic tradition. He seems to have employed the camera out of necessity to capture his sculpture and performances, and he's incorporated music with his moving images in a somewhat distinct way as well. It feels sort of like convergent evolution - the finished product is still a movie but its creative ancestry is unlike that of most cinema. I just found this article, which seems to be examining the ""genealogy"" of Barney's filmed work through a critical lens - I can't access the full text, though!"

TrueFilm,3b6765,LebronNoRing,11,Fri Jun 26 08:16:46 2015 UTC,"There is a quote  from Jim Jarmusch that came to mind as soon I read this here's just a snippet from the start of it  ""Nothing is original. Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination"".   I think this is pretty relevant to all filmmaking, stories aren't original they've been around for thousands of years, what's original is how you put it all together and present it to the audience. The same goes for style even the most particularly stylish directors learned their style consciously or unconsciously from other artist's.    I haven't seen Lost River as of yet but I think from reading your post that the issue is with HOW Gosling stole from his influences. In that it may be borrowed style for the mere sake of it. Another part of that Jarmusch quote says ""Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic"". This couldn't be more true. If what you are borrowing has purpose and heart when put into your film then shoot away; if not then it might a somewhat unnecessary and soulless addition to the film. As I said I haven't seen Lost River so don't know which category it would fall into."
TrueFilm,3b6765,cpierse,2,Fri Jun 26 11:08:04 2015 UTC,"That quote is very fitting and seems to follow my same line of thinking. After I watched the film and started doing research on it I was very confused about where people were coming from when they accused Gosling of ""stealing"" while I felt that you can't steal a style. Thank you for sharing that quote, I will definitely be drawing ""influence"" from it if I write further about Lost River (2014) and similar films."
TrueFilm,3b6765,LuigiVanPeebles,7,Fri Jun 26 15:37:40 2015 UTC,"For me, Lost River fell short of taking those influences and using them to form it's own clear sense of identity. Not just formally, but tonally and thematically, the movie felt like a jumble. Like pieces taken from here and there and packaged together in a translucent box. I don't mind similarity, influence, or homage, but it should stay in the background. The stylistic choices in Lost River seemed to dominate, at the expense of the whole."
TrueFilm,3b6765,LuigiVanPeebles,3,Fri Jun 26 15:16:49 2015 UTC,"Totally different question but did you feel that Goslings use of ""style over substance"" Was a detriment to the film?"
TrueFilm,3b6765,flooddaga7,7,Fri Jun 26 15:40:55 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, and maybe that's not such a different question. I don't mind a film emphasizing ambient qualities, or being more of a ""mood"" piece, and I thought Lost River used that to its advantage. It lent a dream-like quality that supported the story, and made me more willing to go along with the nightmarish elements. Bones, and Billy, and Rat all seemed trapped (or maybe stuck) in the way that you sometimes feel when you half asleep/half awake, and the style was the primary means of creating that feeling.  The downside was that the stylistic choices did keep reminding me of other things external to the movie, and pulling me out of the experience, so it was working against itself there."
TrueFilm,3b6765,revy92,2,Fri Jun 26 15:58:01 2015 UTC,"Terry Malick and Harmony Korine seem to have been strong influences as well. All directors referenced by you and the addition of T + H form a list of who I believe to be the greatest directors of the last 30 years( I guess longer since Kubrick and Terry made films before the 80's.) If you're gonna steal from someone, might as well be from the best.   It is never to the determinant of a film to steal stylistically from those painters of cinema who have done it so beautifully well before you, unless it some how comes off as a bastardization of that style. It tends to be more distracting for me when whole storylines are obviously lifted from other movies, but even that doesn't necessarily render a film irrelevant or simply derivative."
TrueFilm,3b4upy,Andreslargo1,22,Thu Jun 25 23:58:30 2015 UTC,"In the first half of his career especially, Tarantino was always looking for ways to make his next film different in style and look than the last. His movies sort of started looking the same beginning with Kill Bill, Vol. 1 (i.e., focused on gratuitous, movie-based violence), but before that, he never really showed upfront violence happening to a person. When Michael Madsen cuts off the copper's ear in Reservoir Dogs, the camera pans away from the scene; we can only hear the screams, but we don't actually SEE it. In Pulp Fiction, the sodomy and moments of gun violence are split-second on the screen; again, nothing like the Tarantino that shows EVERYTHING nowadays.  It reaches a subtle level in Jackie Brown where a whopping 3 people get killed: a record for Tarantino. I think it goes with his penchant for subverting his audiences' expectations (""Think I'm gonna make something as violent as Pulp Fiction? THINK AGAIN!) I think it's another instance of his ever-present cinephilia: the Beaumont and Melanie deaths, in particular, remind me of Jean-Luc Godard's similar one-take experiments in his earlier films, particularly Vivre sa Vie and Band of Outsiders. There, especially in Vivre sa Vie, Godard frames Karina from the back of her head for an entire scene, refusing to cut to her face. Sort of the same thing with Beaumont and, to a lesser extent, Melanie.  Now was Tarantino thinking of Karina and Godard when he shot those scenes? Perhaps. Perhaps not. But it's not a stretch of the imagination, given Tarantino's cinephilia seems to know no bounds (except when we're concerned with Francois Truffaut's atypical The Bride Wore Black)..."

We do, however, see Orange getting completely slathered in his own blood and later shooting Blond to death onscreen, the tortured cop getting executed, as well as a three-person gunfight with only one survivor, all shown clearly onscreen."
TrueFilm,3b4upy,Sadsharks,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:53:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if that scene in Vivre Sa Vie was a concious inspiration for that part of Jackie Brown. Before moving on to miming Leone in the 2000s, Godard is  the director Tarantino directly draws from in his 90s films. The Band Apart stuff in Reservoir Dogs aesthetic, and the references to Vivre Sa Vie's pool-hall dance scene in the torture scene from Reservoir Dogs and the diner scene in Pulp Fiction.

TrueFilm,3b4upy,seanziewonzie,7,Fri Jun 26 21:13:13 2015 UTC,"I think showing their faces is something you might expect, but I don't think Tarantino works that way. He's a student of film, so he's fully aware of all the cliches, and he probably tries to avoid them if he can. I don't know if it was an intentional thing with him in this case, but the idea of him saying ""We really need to see a close up of the victim's face"" doesn't seem like something he would do, so it was probably wasn't intentional as much as it was just him being aware of what will work and not work in the context of the movie he was making. I think if he choose to show a close up would be more intentional, and things he chooses not to do are more instinctual. I could be wrong, but that's my take."
TrueFilm,3b4upy,OKDokeComputer,3,Fri Jun 26 00:07:11 2015 UTC,good point. ya i could just be overcomplicating it I just thought it was kinda interesting. thanks for the reply though!
TrueFilm,3b4upy,strangenchanted,5,Fri Jun 26 01:45:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's in keeping with the film's unusual style of downplaying action and setpieces. Jackie Brown is constructed as a thriller, but it barely plays out as one. It is more interested in the quiet moments between significant events, when ""nothing"" is happening. In a way it's a hangout movie. We're used to a very different approach in thrillers, so this languid, lackadaisal approach can be puzzling. But it's a style that actually fits the source material well -- Elmore Leonard's books are full of characters conversing and posturing, the catharsis of action long delayed until it suddenly bursts out -- then is quickly moved past.  So yeah, I'd say that it may partly be in service of following Leonard's style. I just finished reading Riding the Rap, and the handling of death there is very matter of fact -- pow, he's gone, move on to the next bit. He doesn't linger on violent acts and their after effects, he tends to shift quickly to the thoughts and behavior of the characters who remain."
TrueFilm,3b4upy,fuadthecat,2,Fri Jun 26 01:52:02 2015 UTC,I concur. This and Get Shorty are the most authentic adaptations of Leonard's writing. You get the super cool feel from them that you get from the books
TrueFilm,3b4upy,BPsandman84,8,Fri Jun 26 14:35:17 2015 UTC,"Adding to what /u/montypython22 said, I'd like to add that despite that popular clip where Tarantino excitedly exclaims that violence is fun, Tarantino actually hates violence, or more pointedly, realistic violence.  Tarantino's films might all be heavily violent, but for the most part the really graphic violence in his films is also sensationalized to the point where they become cartoonish. From Marvin's death in Pulp Fiction to the samurai showdown of Kill Bill and finally all the kills in Django Unchained that look like they'd come out of a Tex Avery cartoon, it always seems detached from reality.   But then you get  these other instances of violence which Tarantino either refrains from showing or downplays. As noted here already, you have the cop's torture in Reservoir Dogs (and the death of Mr. Blonde before he lights the cop on fire), the split second violence of some scenes in Pulp Fiction, and of course Jackie Brown which shies away from it completely. You also have the Kill Bill films which get less and less graphic as the story goes on (and as The Bride's revenge spree get commented on further as being a potentially awful thing). There's the awful crash of Death Proof, which is contrasted with the hilarious cartoon death of Stuntman Mike. In Inglorious Basterds, the Nazi captain that Eli Roth beats to death is shot from far away, and Tarantino even goes as far as to humanize a German soldier before he is shot by Bridget Von Hammersmark (never mind the whole film being about the awful implications of  violence for pleasure in propaganda). Then you have the deaths of the two slaves in Django Unchained that are offscreen yet graphic.  As Monty said, Jackie Brown has this air of Tarantino both trying to subvert audience expectations for violence while also attempting to be more mature. With Jackie Brown, Tarantino wanted to make a film about two old people wanting to escape their current life, and potentially having to use other people (and maybe even each other) to get that. To this effect, since it's a ""serious"" film, Tarantino elects to not show the violence and have most of the damage left up to the viewer's imagination. This didn't really get Tarantino the effect he probably wanted it to have, so he decided to keep up the stylized violence that he had become known for."

TrueFilm,3b50ma,lordhadri,8,Fri Jun 26 23:12:21 2015 UTC,"my intentions are not that but to encourage a discussion aimed towards newer people, and just a general discussion about films.   Well to get away with that we have to talk about what the right way to get started is. Unfortunately I don't have an answer to that yet except 'watch a lot of movies.' But not just any movies. A lot of people see what it takes and what they have to sit through to get 'culture' and understandably flee back to whatever lowbrow genre movie came out yesterday.   The canon exists for a reason.The film culture of today is built on it and always in dialogue with it. So you really do have to watch those movies, with an eye toward how it was accomplished and what they're saying, and back it up with reading. And you have to learn to do all that without every movie being an obligation. With the right attitude, most of them should be as entertaining as what you're used used to. Nobody wants to end up like this person, who managed to sit through thousands of hours of movies, yet judging by their top and bottom tens didn't learn as much as they could have along the way.  Watch Buster Keaton slapstick and Ernst Lubitsch romantic comedies. Watch everything by Orson Welles and Howard Hawks. Watch the B-Movies of Samuel Fuller. Watch Hitchcock on repeat. Watch stuff like Triumph of the Will, Intolerance, and Koyaanisqatsi. See Werner Herzog's documentaries and figure out what he's trying to do. Watch all of Kubrick again and figure out what makes him special. (And what doesn't.) Watch David Lynch and Woody Allen movies. Get over the modern-day aversion to westerns and musicals. Get used to silent movies. Go to a reparatory cinema if and when you can. Look for the origins of more recent films you like and figure out why so many people still care about them. Get used to liking it when things are weird and different, instead of liking things that are familiar. Find a book or two that helps you, instead of relying on internet recommendations, which have underlying assumptions about what you'll like that aren't very good.   Whether you like the above directors or not isn't the point. Once you know what you like the most, you'll know the path of least resistance for you. (Who can guess which of the above listed I like the least?)  There are enough good movies that a syllabus can be as long or short as you want and it's limited by what the person giving it to you has seen and how they liked it. Nevertheless, here's some suggestions for movies everyone should see, arbitrarily limited to ten:  Stagecoach | The Rules of the Game | Sherlock, Jr. | Psycho | The Awful Truth | Citizen Kane | The Passion of Joan of Arc | M | Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans | Casablanca  And that's just the general realm of Amero-European classic drama film, we haven't even begun to talk about documentary, animation, avant-garde, new waves, etc. But you gotta start somewhere and commit."
TrueFilm,3b50ma,lordhadri,2,Fri Jun 26 02:39:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I will try to watch some of those examples; I already saw some trailers for them and they seem pretty good, especially casablanca, ive heard good things about it and I will try to watch it asap.

TrueFilm,3b50ma,RyanSmallwood,2,Fri Jun 26 23:10:17 2015 UTC,Casablanca is one of the better best picture winners but the other reason I mentioned it is because an innumerable number of American movies are built on basic story of it.
TrueFilm,3b50ma,afewthoughtsonfilm,5,Fri Jun 26 23:33:00 2015 UTC,"I like looking at films from a historical perspective, so I'll always recommend getting a grounding in early and silent films to see how filmmaking looks when filmmakers have no idea what a film should look like and how different techniques build up over time.  This way when you get into arthouse filmmakers you'll see how they diverge from more popular filmmakers instead of seeing whats missing from what you expect a movie to be like.  I also find it really helpful to watch film history documentaries.  I often have a resistance to watching movies I know nothing about, and if I've got no reference points I have no way to judge how good a movie is from an area of film history I'm unfamiliar with.  Watching a documentary on a certain period gives you an overview of what the different films are like and will get you excited to start watching the most interesting ones.  A great starting point is Kevin Brownlow's mammoth series Hollywood which is on the American silent film.  Or you can grab a random greatest movies ever list like 1001 Movies to See Before You Die, and start watching stuff."

TrueFilm,3b50ma,old-dusty,3,Fri Jun 26 23:04:25 2015 UTC,"There's too many important films to name, but if you want advice on how to learn about more films, I highly recommend Mark Cousin's book The Story of Film and its 15-hour documentary counterpart.  He gives a great overview of film's history in its entirety, yet also goes well beyond the stereotypical stuff.  Most people, even who are relatively new to cinema, have at least heard of Fellini, Tarkovsky, Kurosawa, etc., but it's important to note that there are many, many, many more figures throughout history who have made exceptional entries and, while perhaps didn't revolutionize the medium in the same way, have made some of the best works of all time.  If you want an extremely comprehensive start to your cinema history, I'd start there (as well as doing what lordhadri said, watching everything you can is crucial as well, regardless of whether you like it or not)."

TrueFilm,3b2xkr,hipsterparalegal,6,Thu Jun 25 15:17:09 2015 UTC,"I was lucky enough to see Pather Panchali at the Film Forum a few weeks ago (came all the way up from southern PA for it, in fact). It blew me away far, far beyond what I was expecting. Ray's biggest influence at that point - Italian Neorealism - very clearly shows through. It's such a subtle, human film, effortlessly depicting the life of a young boy. To me, the film felt similar to my favourite film, The 400 Blows, in that way, how it depicts childhood without being overly sentimental. Apu's childhood is neither full of the intense youthful happiness that far too many directors depict childhood with, nor is it overly full of despair and tragedy. It's just life, as it really happens.   A few things I really loved:    Aiding the ""life as it really happens"" thing was a damn good mixture of comedy and drama. Characters like Indir had me laughing out loud quite a few times. It always seems to me that the some of best directors are the ones who can do this (another example is Ingmar Bergman in The Seventh Seal), and when done right it can really make a film great. Ray does an excellent job in this film of having things happen and having the audience know that they happen without actually showing them. The best example is Durga's death. It's pretty clear what's going on, but by never actually showing it happen, Ray makes the excellent scene in which Harihar learns of his daughter's death that much more devastating (seriously, I think that may have been one of the saddest scenes I've ever seen in a film). He also does an incredible job of using music and sound design as both a stand-in and a complement to dialogue and visuals. For example, the score getting frantic and loud as Sarbajaya drags Durga out of the house in a fit of anger was a great complement to the scene. Even better was the whistle of the train, which more and more as the film goes on seems to signify a sort of nostalgic longing. It sorta reminded me of the blowing of horns standing in for Terry Malloy's emotional turmoil in Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront. The child performances in this film are right up there with Jean-Pierre Leaud's in my mind, especially that of the actress who portrayed Durga. She was phenomenal.  The film is absolutely beautiful. I cannot stress that point enough. Ravi Shankar's score is incredible, and Ray showed a really surprising amount of visual skill for a first-time director. The train scene and the rainstorm come to mind.  In addition to skipping over and simply hinting at major events, as I mentioned above, Ray seems to linger on smaller, day-to-day things, which is yet another aspect of showing life as it happens. It astounds me how he would skip over a major character's death, and yet earlier in the film take the time to film something as simple as that character giving some milk to a cat. It works wonderfully, and contributes a lot to the film's effectiveness.   All in all, I walked in expecting a great film, but what I got blew my expectations out of the water. Pather Panchali is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Unfortunately I wasn't able to see Aparajito and Apur Sansar along with it, but I can't wait to catch them as soon as Criterion releases the trilogy. What a wonderful film."
TrueFilm,3b2xkr,EcoleBuissonniere,3,Thu Jun 25 18:41:29 2015 UTC,a damn good mixture of comedy and drama   Ray was also really good at horror and mixed it freely into several of his movies even though only a few of them were full horror movies.
TrueFilm,3b2xkr,lordhadri,3,Thu Jun 25 20:28:59 2015 UTC,"I should add that trains represent a lot of things in this trilogy, but the whistle of a train becomes a sort of Pavlovian motif to signify the inevitability of death in the lives of the characters. The first time Apu hears it it's just a way of showing how he first becomes aware that there's a world beyond his home that he can go look for, but by the third movie, he's living next to a railyard. make of that what you will!  The trilogy in general, and particularly Apur Sansar, has very good sound editing."
TrueFilm,3b2xkr,lordhadri,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:56:18 2015 UTC,"I give the trains a more straightforward reading, as a symbol of the mixed legacy of ""progress."" Most dramatic films are going to deal with death in some way, so of course anything that's a signpost along the chronological path of the movie could be interpreted as representing the inevitability of death (because death is always the last thing that happens to you). But I'd be curious to hear more specifics of how you think the train relates to death.   I'd kinda make the same argument for the trucks/cars in Jalsaghar (Music Room). They represent the inevitable marching of (technological/historical) progress, which leaves some behind, but draws others onward toward their fate which, humans being mortal, can only be death."
TrueFilm,3b2xkr,abrightersummerday,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:57:18 2015 UTC,"Because the train whistles are specifically juxtaposed with someone's death multiple times in the trilogy? One of the last things we see in Aparajito is Sarbajaya being practically train whistled into an early grave; the first scene of Apur Sansar shows the wind blowing the whistles into Apu's room to remind us what happened to his female relatives. That way doom lingers over the whole movie from the beginning and it doesn't feel totally cruel when it happens to him again.  Your 'straightforward' reading is equally correct, the trains represent progress, but there's no progress in human lives, just the long and lonely track toward the inevitable. That's Ray's whole point with these movies; Apu's character arc across the trilogy is all about accepting mortality. The use of train metaphors to express this is obviously the reason why Wes Anderson set The Darjeeling Limited, his own movie about accepting mortality/enthusiasm for Ray movies, on a passenger train. I wouldn't be surprised if Miyazaki got the idea from Ray as well as similar things happen in The Wind Rises."
TrueFilm,3b2xkr,lordhadri,2,Mon Jun 29 04:39:39 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I'm much more convinced now, thanks for the elaboration. I haven't seen Aparajito/Apur Sansar as recently (or as many times) as Pather Panchali, so I didn't remember all those details. I'll keep a closer eye on this thread when I re-watch them."

TrueFilm,3b2xkr,EcoleBuissonniere,4,Thu Jun 25 20:27:10 2015 UTC,"Here's how I feel about Ray so far:  Essential Masterpieces: Pather Panchali, The Music Room, Aparajito, The Big City, The World of Apu  Deeper cuts: Charulata, Devi  For Completists: The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha  I haven't seen the others yet.  I'm glad that I got into Ray right as Criterion finally got around to releasing the Apu trilogy. They're showing all over, not just in New York, but if you can't see them in theaters then I'm sure they'll show up on Hulu+ eventually. In the meantime, Mahanagar is the one I'd recommend everybody check out as an introduction if you don't feel like watching Pather Panchali (one of the greatest debut films ever) on YouTube."
TrueFilm,3b2xkr,lordhadri,3,Thu Jun 25 15:46:56 2015 UTC,"It's a great film. I like how simplistic it is in a way, but still big, beautiful and full of depth. Talk about a strong debut. A very interesting depiction on how rural life, poverty and dreams can be to human beings. Ray's direction is just lyrical and poetic, very pure and full of emotions. Ravi Shankar's music is amazing too. And when it comes to Ray in general, I have to say that he was a great director and very important for Indian cinema (and of course cinema in general). Jalsaghar (1958) is my favourite by him. I remember that it was the first Indian film I ever saw. It makes me happy that Criterion are releasing the Apu trilogy on Blu-ray and that we're going to see even more of his films restored. Speaking of Ray, I actually bought a little book about him written by Folke Isaksson and Stig T. Karlsson that I should start reading soon."

TrueFilm,3b1hjs,N8thanEL,36,Thu Jun 25 05:15:26 2015 UTC,"This is gonna sound strange, but just roll with me.   Difference between a good and bad actor, from how I taught, is using what is referred to as moment-to-moment action. When a character is not talking, they are reacting. The reaction shows far more character than anything they actually say. Difference between paying attention intently or just looking off into space or playing with their shoelace. Little things that we all naturally do in everyday conversation. An actor has to replicate this and make it convincing.  Ethan Hawke tends to do this, this is why he's a good actor. Jaden Smith does not.  I'm not actually an actor myself, so I have no idea how to implement any of this, I just know how to explain it, if that makes sense. But notice how Hawke is always doing something, always reacting when he's not talking. It's little things, and tends to be natural instincts.   Hopefully this helps."
TrueFilm,3b1hjs,DoNotMatter,13,Thu Jun 25 06:12:53 2015 UTC,100% agree about Hawke being great at this I actually captured a scene of his a while ago pointing this exact thing out

You can tell that he just wants to shout out everything he feels is wrong about this, but is in no position of power to do so, and it's tearing him up."

TrueFilm,3b1hjs,DoNotMatter,7,Thu Jun 25 16:54:05 2015 UTC,"This is partly what Meisner exercises (repetition) are for. All pro actors can do this, so at this level it's not really a differentiating factor. It's rather like how all pro baseball players know how to catch and throw. But are they in the right position and on the right team? Do they get hit enough balls in the field to showcase their ability? <-- these are the differentiating factors.  Additionally Meisner also requires making an ideal choice. Students first start out repeating and observing, then they do so within a specific action: this creates the illusion of conflict (and hopefully when applied to full technique, one that is suited to translating the scene to performance for the audience i.e. ideal choices).  Meisner's benefits: Editing can fuck it up or interfere, or make it better. It's better observed on stage or in some long single-cam takes.  I could reasonably doubt Jaden Smith took enough group acting classes/master classes to reap the benefits of this kind of exercise, but I have no idea. I'm actually not familiar with his acting, now that I think of it.  This is an important part of acting but at the same time just a piece of the pie.  Each school/technique teaches Meisner differently. I prefer the Practical Aesthetics angle.  I'm a talkative, outgoing person, so personally I really love this part of acting: it challenges me to listen and really pay attention to the other person. Meisner reps are how actors build that muscle memory.  Comedy improv teaches some of these skills but in a different way (i.e. getting out of your head). Most actors will have taken scene study and improv."

TrueFilm,3b1hjs,DoNotMatter,96,Thu Jun 25 19:05:28 2015 UTC,"You could read Practical Handbook for the Actor to try and get your head around the relationship between text and acting, but really you'd probably do best to take a good scene study course, if possible.  Something else that helps is reading screenplays or plays before they are cast or produced and then watching them later. You can see how much of the actor (and director) are in the role. This eliminates hindsight bias or the influence of experts.  Juno is a very splashy role. A large portion of great acting does not announce itself in that way because the script more often than not requires it not to. A good part of the best acting I've seen in motion picture over the last decade has been by non household names. Stephen Dillane, for instance. And it was before my time but, F. Murray Abraham's performance in AMADEUS is better than most of anything I hear people going on about in terms of A listers. It's strange that it's never cited given that it was recognized at the time.  A great performance is more than serviceable -- the actor must make ideal theatrical choices, but something in their unique personality and imagination allows them to do that in an unexpected way on x specific role. Think about how Reese Witherspoon or Natalie Portman would have played Juno. It wouldn't have fit and would have felt artificial (neither have the range for that role). Page had a lot to say through that role and the imagination to understand it and make ideal, interesting choices that other actors would not have made. Jennifer Lawrence was cast well in WINTER'S BONE, but can you imagine her as Juno?  I actually don't think that people are that good at picking out great performances or understanding how they occur. DiCaprio is a bit overhyped for that reason. He makes a choice and fully commits to it, but he lacks nuance and dynamic range. The right director will eventually challenge him in that way.   Great performances are absolutely tied to great writing and accurate casting, and usually are a splashy sort of role that is highly noticeable. Often these roles contain externals (learning a dialect, learning to dance ballet, gaining or losing weight) that have nothing to do with the bare bones of scene study and are more noticeable to non-experts.   In terms of how much casting matters to a great performance, think about the miscasting of high quality actors in COLD MOUNTAIN. The screenplay gave plenty to work with, but no one was cast spot on in that movie. And look how miscast Lawrence was in AMERICAN HUSTLE. Another actor would have been seamless in that role. The feeling of being miscast -- I can tell you -- is a strange sensation. But as an actor you're not going to turn down a good job you can deliver suitably and I think most probably choose to view it as a professional challenge, if they acknowledge it at all. It's not just limited to pros -- there are teens in high school plays who were miscast this year and probably know exactly what this feels like. Sometimes it's just about being a team player given the available talent pool.  After writing and casting, a great performance then requires solid (at least) directing in order to be properly showcased.  Sometimes you can see a great actor doing as well as they can with a terrible screenplay and/or non-script savvy director, and therefore they don't look as ridiculous as other cast members. Ian Mckellen in various blockbusters, and Ewan doing what he could in EPISODE II. I suppose this is one way that mastery might make itself known.  For a recent pop culture example of how much casting plays a part, I saw WWZ and was pleasantly surprised. Pitt's character was rather feminist for an action hero -- the writer didn't inhibit him to stereotypical gender lines, but rather wrote him more openly and realistically: affectionate toward his family, other families and fellow warriors, etc.. I don't think other stars likely to be cast in such a role could have pulled that off. Cruise or Smith, for example. Pitt has a different lifestyle involving a pretty dynamic and open minded family life, he's a different person, and that aspect of the role suited his emotional imagination, and he made believable, warm choices for that character.  So the first ingredient for a great performance is great writing, the second is accurate casting, usually based on the actor's audition (or similar previous work) wherein they make choices that are both ideal and yet unique to their inner life in some regard -- and that special personal blend in context suits the character in question. Finally, a splashier role -- especially with externals -- is more likely to be noticed by audiences. So are other contrasts, i.e. a famous actor playing against type in another way. (Charlize Theron in MONSTER. This role would have been less noticeable if the actor were an unknown who we thought always looked like that.)  Celeb actors are cast in roles that they aren't perfect for more often than not. They'll still look good (everyone is at a professional level) and will translate the story well via their role, but it won't be that lightning effect that you describe. Many of these performances are well played but replaceable, like in COLD MOUNTAIN.   And as a final thought, personally liking an actor isn't the same as critical quality. I find Cameron Diaz really watchable personally, but that doesn't match with how I'd assess her work critically.  edit: Someone asked for context about where I'm coming from. Here you go. I studied at Atlantic and Groundlings among other places, but most of the technique I prefer comes from those two schools. Atlantic/Tisch technique is Practical Aesthetics, which particularly appeals to writer-actors given its emphasis on text. It's also very useful for directors. I recommend that screenwriters/playwrights and directors take their intro scene study drama class over any other ""directing actors"" workshop. Their coaches also have directing workshops using this technique -- it's helpful for interpreting and bridging other techniques (actors in your scene will all have different methods)."
TrueFilm,3b1hjs,J_Sto,11,Fri Jun 26 17:29:40 2015 UTC,"Wow. Thorough and VERY well said. Thanks for that.  Speaking of actors that have been cast against type to garner a better perceived performance (Charlize theron in Monster, Denzel in Training Day, Heath Ledger in Dark Knight); Do you think that the inverse of that scenario is true and actors that have had seemingly ""good"" performances in their first film(s) will have a hard time fitting into any other role because of the way they have been seen is so unique to a certain film(s)? A couple examples being (Cuba Gooding after Jerry Maguire, Linda Blair in exorcist, Jaye Davidson in The Crying Game).   Do you think that this is a case of them being in such specifically niche character roles that it was impossible for them to have a ""type""? Were the performances ""Good""? Or were the performances simply a case of the role just happening to be the perfect fit for the particular person (Think Jon Heder in Napoleon Dynamite)? Is it just a matter of them finding that next great breakout role, or are they just not great ""actors""?  I'd love to know your thoughts on the matter."
TrueFilm,3b1hjs,sculder17,23,Fri Jun 26 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"fitting into any other role because of the way they have been seen is so unique to a certain film(s)?   I'll suggest that that's under the umbrella of typecasting. I think it's harder for long-running TV series actors than film actors.  Jon Heder is a good example. The trouble with the way things work is that he's not a lead in the way studios engineer it (they'd put him in the ""character actor"" column), he didn't have a history of credits (i.e. not a child actor growing up) and that was a very small film pay and budget wise. He might have had trouble picking up a good agent despite the success of that one film because they might have thought they couldn't sell him outside that franchise (even if he was a great actor). It would have helped if he had more context before that role, which is insane, but it's the downside of social psychology and the way congloms choose to do business intensifies that to a crazy degree. BTW: Have we seen whether or not he has any range? Do we know what he additioned for and near missed on, or if he was attached to anything that fell through? I'm not sure if he's had a chance to show us much. I'm not that familiar with him aside from knowing every line of ND. ;-)  He might still end up on a show like PARKS & REC as a different kind of character. But he'll be competing with every SNL alum and all of the improv schools' active casts, etc.. He just needs to keep working in supporting or smaller roles on quality things as much as possible and he'll probably break out in something again.   Cuba kept working steadily and is more than fine, relatively speaking. There is a real problem he is dealing with here because there are few great American film roles in any given year, and significantly fewer for women and people of color, and even fewer for women of color, since we're talking about it. Most of those roles tend to be race related roles without much outside that. He's had some solid roles since then. Lupita Nyong'o will probably face similar challenges, but more so for the demo reasons described. Coming from Yale she has a perfect acting eduction pedigree, too, just to show you how difficult things are.  I'll tell you that I've auditioned with a few younger male leads that have been pounding the pavement for years and that I can't believe aren't regular working actors on a series or, in one case, in heroic film leads. They're better than many working actors in their twenties, particularly where television leads are concerned, and equally or more marketable. It's scary that it's not just about talent and having a great personality and professionalism, and the right look, and doing all the right things.  So careers and their blocks and challenges are multifaceted and at least somewhat unique to the individual. It's hard for everyone, but some people get a leg up by being related to someone in the business (JJ Abrams, Kate Hudson), being white, being male, growing up in SoCal, being rich or financially supported, finding the one person in a small pool (agent or whatever) that takes a shine to them… . Talent and professionalism aren't enough to cut through that noise -- again I found that very alarming when I first learned it. It's incredibly hard to make an investment in yourself as an actor, writer or director against that level of risk. If I were just acting, I'd have gone insane because the risk and lack of control is much higher than writing/directing.   No one in a significant position of authority tells actors any of this because the entire system profits off actors underwriting the dev expenses on a huge talent pool. And because the Hollywood mythology helps sell movies. ;-) Actors hide their troubles (but sometimes reveal them after they're cleared and they're successful) because that kind of honesty is damaging to one's image/myth and career.  And most actors are desperate or don't have much actual power -- even well known celebs. There's just not enough great work to go around and there are very few people making top decisions on studio casting. Furthermore, people -- yes people! -- become fashionable or unfashionable at different times, which isn't something we should participate in, when possible. When it rains it pours, and the opposite. (There is probably a moneyball-style solution to this with casting. I think pulp directors like Robert Rodriguez or Tarantino would be more likely to take advantage of that.)  Speaking of MONEYBALL and ""against type,"" Jonah Hill is another example. Acting is like baseball in that if you stand in the field and never get rocked enough to show off your skills (i.e. if no one hits the ball your way in a challenging manner), then no one knows what you're capable of. Happens to outfielders on some teams, then suddenly out of nowhere they pull off a stunning catch. Well, it's the first opportunity they've had in a game!"

Filmmakers have this problem in general, so if you know a lot about production, it's natural to have that awareness off and on, especially when flaws present.  Seeing a few great plays might not hurt, either. You might find yourself on the edge of your seat."
TrueFilm,3b1hjs,TriumphantGeorge,6,Thu Jun 25 05:59:23 2015 UTC,"Seeing a few great plays might not hurt, either. You might find yourself on the edge of your seat.   Yes, the seats in theatres are much narrower than those in cinemas! :-)  Joking aside, great comment. With all the intense promotional activities that go with filmmaking these days, it's very hard to not have a ""meta narrative"" going on in your head when you see a film.  That's why it's really refreshing to spend time going to, say, a festival with foreign-produced films. It's far more likely that you won't know the actors (at least to the same extent) and also the acting style is often different and so seems less ""movie"".  Which leads me to an additional thought: US actors tend to be ""themselves but in that situation"" whereas European actors tend to be ""characters in that situation"". I wonder whether that makes it more difficult to divorce the media coverage and personalities from those supposedly portrayed in the film. I think it's something that has gotten a bit worse over time. US actors who do characters are seen as ""performing a trick"" or doing an Oscar-baiting performance, which actually usually means worse acting.  From Nathan Fillion's IAmA:   Q: Now my big question is do you feel that any of your roles show the real you or do you change yourself to better become the character subconsciously? Or is it all a persona you put on and take off at the end of the day? Again thank you for being you!  A: First, thank you for being so sweet. Second, my brother once told me that he couldn’t believe I get paid to act, because all I’m doing is being myself. I take that as a compliment. You want to know how to act? Act naturally."

Due to this I enjoy knowing and finding the small things in films like how was it shot, editing choices etc. My girlfriend hates that I honestly don't care about endings so much as the process the film used to be made.

Eventually I realised the problem was that I was simply seeing too much good acting. Because honestly, most of the performances in most of the films any /r/truefilm regular is likely to see, are on the whole very very good compared to the mean. I genuinely believe that a lot of people across a lot of art forms (jazz, painting, literature, whatever) actually hinder their appreciation of the form overall by only being exposed to the 'classics' or great works in that form. For a long stretch of time, I was only watching highly regarded films full of very accomplished actors, and just like you, I felt like I couldn't pick out what distinguished good acting, what made someone more or less believable.

TrueFilm,3b1hjs,catgotcha,5,Fri Jun 26 15:59:55 2015 UTC,"One thing that hasn't been mentioned yet (I believe) is also an actors ability to keep to the flow of the movie's tone despite the shooting script.   Remember Movies are giant jigsaw puzzles, with many scenes shot out of sequence to maximize location and minimize crew moves. So what appears to be a natural emotional arc may actually be an actor 'jumping' around day to day, emotion to emotion depending on the scene/location.   Personally if I don't recognize the person that's a huge compliment to their abilities as an actor. Gary Oldman, Daniel Day Lewis come immediately to mind."
TrueFilm,3b1hjs,catgotcha,3,Thu Jun 25 14:42:41 2015 UTC,"That's precisely it for me. Great actors can turn it on and turn it off at a moment's notice. They do the climactic scene in week 2 of a 10-week shooting schedule, and they do the Oscar-moment scene in Week 4, and everything else jumbled up in between. It's pretty impressive that they can do that and maintain a consistency all the way through that makes the movie and role feel totally believable from beginning to end."
TrueFilm,3b1hjs,irmavep,3,Thu Jun 25 15:38:40 2015 UTC,"Something someone said a few years ago about acting really rang true to me - he said that good actors can simply walk down a street while in the role and you really believe they are walking down the street. Bad actors look like they're pretending to walk down the street and it just gives it all away.  It's the little nuances, really. The way they look at the other actor, the way they are when they're walking, the way they light their cigarette, the way their eyes glint when they're talking about a hot woman, the way they yawn when they're tired, etc.   Reading your lines convincingly is not terribly hard to do. It's the little nuances, the little things like those I mentioned that are incredibly hard to look natural doing. Acting is all abut contriving - the key is to not look like you're doing it.  Others mentioned that you forget the actor and you really believe the person. That's absolutely true. DiCaprio is popular not so much because he's a good actor as much as he's incredibly entertaining and charismatic on screen. Cate Blanchett opposite him in the Aviator, despite her unique looks, really has you convinced that she really is Kathrine Hepburn. She has all those wonderful little nuances down to a T and it's incredible.  That, to me, is the mark of good acting. The little nuances, the little gestures, the ""natural"" stuff that people do every second when they talk, walk, and go about their lives."

TrueFilm,3b1hjs,buddboetticherfan,2,Thu Jun 25 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"I personally don't really pay attention to a film's quality of acting, at least not consciously. A lot of people define good acting as a performance where the emotions and mannerisms seem genuine, but I don't really view it that way. I consider a good performance to be when an actor is simply good for a certain part.   Look at Wes Anderson movies, for example. There are many scenes in his movies where he has his actors (very talented actors) do deliberately flat performances. Performances that literally anybody could do. But that works because it's kind of funny and it fits with the style. The same thing goes for something like Mulholland Drive, which featured deliberately over-the-top soap opera acting.   And then there are films where the actor puts on a very convincing performance because they're perfect for the part. For example, I heard that the actress in the move Fish Tank was not a professional actress at all; the director simply witnessed a random girl breaking up with her boyfriend in public, decided she was good for the role, and offered her the job. And it worked out great because the film was written specifically for her. (Someone correct me if I'm wrong on this.)  So when I see a performance I'm not really into, I just assume that they're not right for the part, not that they're a bad actor. Anybody can be an actor in the right situation.   EDIT: Although you do need a lot of talent and training if your role requires intense crying or something like that."
TrueFilm,3b1hjs,joneSee,2,Thu Jun 25 18:22:59 2015 UTC,"Here's something I wrote about acting that might be helpful:  Five Ways of Looking at Acting in the Movies  One: Motivation  When I see a performance in a movie, I want the actor to get across why their character is doing what they are doing.  I am all for ambiguity: human beings often have lots of competing, overlapping, and even contradictory reasons for doing something, so I especially appreciate it when an actor can get mixed motivations across all at once.  If the character's motivation has to stay hidden (as with Julianne Moore's performance in Neil Jordan's version of The End of the Affair), then (a) I want it to make sense in retrospect once the mystery is solved and (b) I want to be able to speculate meaningfully about the pre-solution parts of the performance.  Two: Expression  When I see a performance in a movie, I want the actor to expose the emotional state of their character.  Maybe expose is the wrong word, but I'm wary of getting too poetic or too sappy. I'm thinking here of something like Jennifer Connelly's performance in Dark Water: she doesn't build her character like the supporting actors do in that movie, she's not especially convincing (nor is she especially unconvincing) as a young working, single mom. But she opens up to the camera and radiates vulnerability.  Of course, I don't like having to use a word like ""radiates"" to talk about this - too poetic again. More specifically, she has an expressive face and she's comfortable enough in front of the camera to let it pick up all its subtle shifts.  Three: Achievement  When I see a performance in a movie, I want the actor to impress me with their skills.  We are talking about performance after all, and showing off what you can do is a big part of that.  Skills is a big category, though. It can be actory skills - Kevin Spacey's inventive line readings in The Usual Suspects or L.A. Confidential, Daniel Day-Lewis's physical work in My Left Foot - or it can be showier, song-and-dance-style skills - Jackie Chan's highly choreographed stunts and fights in Project A, Steve Martin's physical comedy in All of Me.  Four: Specifics  When I see a performance in a movie, I want the actor to create a character (or at least a moment) I might recognize from life.  I want to be convinced. Like with Ricky Gervais as David Brent in The Office: he obnoxious like people I know in real life are obnoxious, not charmingly obnoxious like a lot of TV characters.  Five: Swept Away  When I see a performance in a movie, I want to be charmed.  Moviemaking isn't necessarily that much fun. Work is work and while I don't have any extra sympathy for actors (who are, after all, probably getting paid to do what they love), I do recognize that the process can be just as much a pain in the ass as many other jobs.  But when I go to the movies, I don't want to have to think about any of that. So, when I'm watching Will Smith in Enemy of the State, I don't want to start thinking about what a drag it must be to have to run around one of these big budget action monstrosities: I just want to admire his poise and sense of humor."

TrueFilm,3b1hjs,nkleszcz,4,Fri Jun 26 20:35:23 2015 UTC,"The commenter has a point - that we probably all have different levels of empathy with acting performances.   Just as some people watch a film and ""see"" the action and ""hear"" the dialogue, but don't pick up on the underlying imagery or meaning; they don't ""feel"" the movie. (For instance, there's a scene where two characters sit opposite each other in tense silence for a long period, following some dramatic event. They get bored because ""nothing is happening"". )   So maybe there's a related aspect - you can ""see and hear"" the actors but don't ""feel"" the character, to varying degrees that are probably dependent on the material and whether you've encountered real people who are similar.  Not because you're a sociopath, though. Just because you don't fake-connect in that way to 2D images that happen to be shaped like people, but aren't people - they are only people to the extent we imagine them to be so."

You can tell if they are going to a very deep, personal space with the material, or they are just reciting dialogue.    Look at one of the penultimate scenes in the TV series Breaking Bad.  Walter White is yelling at his wife on the telephone, calling her the most despicable names possible.  He knows the police are listening in.  And as he knows this, he says some lines that infer that she is entirely off the hook, and the police will have nothing on her.  He saves her life.   Look at her reaction shots.  She feels the greatest hurt when hearing these terms, but then she catches on what he is really doing, and she rolls with it.  He just saved her life from the penitentiary.  He just took the blame entirely upon himself.  She is by terms both in great pain, in great sorrow, and great deep gratitude for his sacrifice, even though he didn't have to do it.

TrueFilm,3b1hjs,TheWiredWorld,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:45:31 2015 UTC,"There's much to be said about performance, which I think is an idea carried over to screen-acting from theater-acting, where an actor 'performs' as an athlete would.   I am very interested in the ways screen-acting differs from theater-acting. Screen actors are required to perform shorter feats and are given numerous attempts at those feats, with a panel of judges to later decide the best out of those attempts. They perform feats with variations in intensity, where that intensity does not depend solely on the script, as it does on the stage, but instead depends very much on the distance and placement of the camera. Screen actors like to know what kind of camera lens is used and how they are framed in the shot. They have to hit specific marks to stay within the frame and within the correct lighting.  There is another idea that the nature of a screen actor is less to 'perform' than to 'be', as if the objects of a documentary. Much of the changes seen in screen-acting over the last century can be attributed to a gradual understanding of this distinction—where actors used to present emotions as they would on a stage, over time actors seemed to realize they needed to feel those emotions directly, with method acting as extreme of that. In truth, screen actors don't need to feel emotions as opposed to presenting emotions—screen actors really need to present themselves as opposed to presenting emotions."

Another great screen actor, Daniel Day- Lewis, is often demonstrative and doesn't particularly allow an audience into his experience. You watch him objectively. A man like Heath Ledger (RIP) will allow you in, as seen in Candy. When it comes to whether one ""likes"" an actor, that comes down to taste really and whether you see yourself in that person. Does something about them resonate with you? Often I find, people's favourite actors have a resemblance to them funny enough. Also, I think it's important that an actor is exciting to watch.

Both address families often, but from very different perspectives. Ozu often focuses on what separates families and generations. Koreeda focuses more on the pathos that each individual faces.  Koreeda embraces a much more documentary style. Ozu is extremely exact in his staging and he lets you know it. He's git his camera angle, and he's sticking to it. Koreeda moves his camera much more.

It's a lazy journalism tool which speaks of an incessant need to force things into genres and categories.    Whilst Kore-eda is influenced by Ozu, you could make an equally strong case for the influence of Naruse. I'm sure he likes non-Japanese film makers too...  The Ozu comparison is obvious for Still Walking, but completely lacking in something like Airdoll.  Kore-eda did a recent interview with the Guardian where he seems fairly tired with the Ozu tag.   We should let directors develop their craft outside the shadow of their forefathers. Kore-eda should only ever be the modern day Kore-eda. It's a bit disrespectful not to let him be his own person."
TrueFilm,3b2jb7,GJorgenson,3,Mon Jun 29 15:06:54 2015 UTC,"Aruitemo aruitemo (2008) is quite good, but I wouldn't say that it's as masterful as some of Ozu's best films. Koreeda's work doesn't really have the same framing and uncompromising form as many of Ozu's films have, even if we can see that he's a bit on his way in specifically Aruitemo aruitemo (2008) where the influences are very clear. Koreeda said himself that he feels that his own films are much closer to what Naruse did, and I would also agree a bit with that, especially with the bleaker worldview in social reality and a bit more sentimentality. The tranquil subtlety and unique stillness isn't really on par with Ozu for me. Some of Koreeda's work before Aruitemo aruitemo (2008) also had a more documentary feeling. And let's not forget that Ozu did comedies and gangster films in the beginning of his career. Anyways, the themes in Aruitemo aruitemo (2008) are of course very similar to the majority of films that Ozu made, that's easy to agree with. I'm just a bigger fan of Ozu than Koreeda, but I absolutely think Koreeda has done some good stuff. As I already said, Aruitemo aruitemo (2008) is good, although it's more of a homage that copies a lot from Ozu and Naruse than being something really, really unique."
TrueFilm,3ayq48,mythicalsage,3,Wed Jun 24 16:00:03 2015 UTC,"This movie is more about perceived disabilities vs actual disabilities than it is about actual boxing but obviously boxing itself being the core of the movie outlines the overall metaphor of struggle and fighting for a better life. You watch maggie throughout the film struggle with the perception that being female and poor is a handicap and ultimately fight to overcome these ""handicaps"". I don't believe or agree that her mother is shown as having an actual handicap (or more to the point one that cannot be fixed through fighting against it) as pointed out in her last scene she is told she is fat and lazy, fat being the disability/lazy being the cause. This also reflects to being poor, her mother and family only seem to look to others for money, through welfare and Maggie and you see Eddie who cannot have any money otherwise he will gamble it away. Overall its summing up societies perceptions of what a disability is to what disabilities actually are. When Maggie is a paraplegic she has a handicap that she cannot fix through will power and is totally dependant on others to survive. This is the difference between being poor or obese and the reason she looses the will to live"

I'm so glad shorts like this exist to help me along, because I never would have thought of this interpretation myself. I'll definitely have to re-watch this film with this interpretation in mind.  I always remember Million Dollar Baby not sitting right with me. I always just assumed the movie was one big, preachy ""assisted suicide"" movie, but that never really made sense based off the rest of the film. She just randomly become paraplegic, her life spirals downards, and she wants out. Like you said, without this interpretation, the movie seems to be heading one direction, stop on a dime, and race towards another without any warning.  The idea of the whole movie being an examination of both physical and non-physical handicaps created by our societal metaphors really ties everything together much more nicely. Thanks again for doing these, they're really helpful.  As a side note, have you thought of setting up a Patreon account for this series? I'd totally be up for chipping in a few dollars per episode to keep them coming. Just a thought, I know how much time it takes to make these."

TrueFilm,3axzqz,The_Silver_Avenger,52,Wed Jun 24 12:08:54 2015 UTC,"It also ties into a rejection of conservatism.   Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy is conservative as fuck, while Brad Bird is very nostalgic for an era he seems to believe was purely driven by a want to explore space.   It isn't a good idea to frame NASA funding as ""conservative"" or ""liberal"" because it isn't a polarizing issue. The government won't shut down because Senate Democrats or Republicans want to gut NASA. Both will fund or defund the organization depending on the demands of the economy. In fact, a University of Maryland political scientist, whose name I'm forgetting, analyzed House and Senate votes over the past few decades to understand polarization. If the President came out in support of an uncontroversial issue, the probability of an opposing party member voting against the President rose from 1/3 to 1/2. Guess what uncontroversial issue she looked at? NASA funding.  What's more, here's Neil deGrasse Tyson on funding for the sciences:   The budget for the NIH tripled [under Bush]. The budget for the NSI went up 40% [under Bush]. The budget for NASA went up 20% [under Bush]. During the Clinton administration, the budget dropped by 25%.   So did these budgets increase under Bush because of his conservatism, and decrease under Clinton because of his liberalism? Likely not. There were other things for them to attend to.  Okay, okay, let's say you don't believe me that your question is flawed. Let's play a game of mood affiliation with your post. Would you say liberals or conservatives are more likely to decry a decline in ""American ambition"", or ""American exceptionalism"", since the two are so tied together? I'd say conservatives are more concerned with this.  But, honestly, I feel like you're throwing around the word ""conservatism"" too loosely.    The film industry is a comparatively 'liberal' industry so it is natural that there would be a large groundswell of support for NASA and a large backlash against the idea of conservatism.   In the sentence above, conservatism is used very clearly as a political philosophy, a set values that guides groups of people through governance.   Tomorrowland also rejects conservatism in its core conceit - people are taken to another world to advance civilization beyond what they'd be able to do with the rest of us.    While here, conservatism is less of a political philosophy and more of a way of behavior. Just what is your point? Just what type of conservatism are you referring to?  edit: I see some ""Brad Bird is an objectivist"" comments below, and I'm gonna go out and say those arguments are weak parsings of muddied tea leaves."

Things like the 'opposite of progressivism', which Interstellar and Tommorowland are advocating; the future is through progress at all costs and we should never look back.  But I am getting a bit muddled. Basically, the conservatism thing was a bit of an add-on. I just noticed the leap before you look ideas of the two films.  The real thing I tried to get at was whether the perceived decline of NASA (according to reddit at least) would a) be a trend that features long in the future in more films and b) whether we'd get more 'stealth adverts' for NASA in the future, and what people think of those."

So that depends on how well these films perform, honestly. Interstellar performed very well, but Tomorrowland is a box office bomb. A big studio will take a risk on Christopher Nolan because he's Christopher Nolan. While Brad Bird doesn't have as big of a brand, studios will still take a risk on him. But if the lesser brand fails in drawing audiences, won't big studios save their money for other films? How can less established directors, then, take up the mantle of 'stealth adverts' for NASA?  I don't know if we'll get 'stealth adverts' for NASA in the future. There are more obstacles in making such films than for many other films."
TrueFilm,3axzqz,BrckT0p,2,Wed Jun 24 17:59:34 2015 UTC,"I guess you're right. The Martian, which comes out at some point, seems to use NASA in more of a way that fits into the plot rather than trying to make it stand out.  Sorry for the fairly poorly phrased original question. I've had a few things going on in the real world, and combined with me trying to wrap my head around United Passions it has damn near broken me. There's just so much wrong with this movie."
TrueFilm,3axzqz,mynameismarkcarlos,3,Wed Jun 24 18:31:49 2015 UTC,"I think you're over analyzing this. Any movie which touches on space or space exploration (half the sci-fi genre) is going to either mention NASA, a combination of NASA and ""the russians"", the armed forces (fighting aliens), or a futuristic privatized space company.   Interstellar takes place in the near future so of course they're going to use NASA. If SpaceX continues to make strides we'll probably see them (or their likeness) mentioned in future space related movies. If more countries get their programs off the ground, they'll be mentioned as well.  If you want to talk about financial liberalism vs conservatism then you might want to check out how NASA gets it's funding. Since the space race, it's not as simple as ""we want to go to the moon"" it's more like ""we should send a rover to Mars and here's all the useful information we'll gather that can only be gathered by doing this mission.""  That being said, I wasn't getting a lot of positive vibes about NASA from the movie until the very end when everything worked out. It put NASA in more of a big brother/need to know roll which a lot of people don't like."

The terrestrial govt's smearing of history and emphasis on social welfare sounded like conservative stereotypes of socialist/communist countries, whereas the movie's NASA and its emphasis on a few lone, talented individuals came across as pretty in line with the libertarian viewpoint of modern conservatives"
TrueFilm,3axzqz,lordhadri,5,Wed Jun 24 20:41:40 2015 UTC,"Well, ""Interstellar"" is a movie about space travel. And you are arguing that it shouldn't present NASA in a good light?  Frankly, I think you are right that the much more obvious solution in the film would have been to ""fix"" the earth, but I guess you just have to accept the premise that they had no choice but to leave the earth.  If they had called the space organization ""International Space Agency"" you would have been OK with it?"
TrueFilm,3axzqz,lordhadri,22,Wed Jun 24 16:41:44 2015 UTC,"You thesis doesn't make any sense. Christopher Nolan and Brad Bird happen to be two of the most openly right wing filmmakers working today!   It is true that American conservatives are currently associated with fiscal austerity and anti-science mentality. But it's not like the pro-science Left is picking a major fight over the role of NASA because they don't care about it any more than the Right. Back when it was all about advancing science to compete with with Red Menace, conservatives were all for it. The intellectual right-wing has long been associated with science fiction writers, including Nolan and Bird. They both deplore post-9/11 cynicam and make movies reassuring a belief in American Exceptionalism. NASA's achievements are obviously some of the greatest proofs of American Exceptionalism's existence to them. They are also very different filmmakers in their approach.  I should also point out that Interstellar does not advance a progressive, inclusive vision for science or the future whatsoever. It is a movie about how America was the only nation-state to survive the end of the world and NASA has to work together with a family farmer to pick it up and push it somewhere else. Then children can still play baseball in space. Science isn't an alternative to religion in Interstellar, it replaces religion as a mystical belief system.  From what I've heard of Tomorrowland it once again entertains objectivist ideas about what the future should be like, which is not at all a rejection of Conservatism, just an atheistic, pro-technology update of it.  Christopher Nolan is an American. He was raised in Chicago, his whole film career happened here. And so what if he said Interstellar was an advertisement for NASA? It's not like they can afford their own. He probably wants to inspire younger Americans than himself to go plant American flags in space."
TrueFilm,3axzqz,lordhadri,9,Wed Jun 24 13:25:58 2015 UTC,"But Brad Bird describes himself as a centrist. Also, Nolan may have both American and British citizenship, but Wikipedia states that he was educated in England (school and college) and started making his short films in college - UCL (London) - which he apparently chose for its film making capabilities. Following (his first film) is set in London! Nolan even donated $2,500 to Obama's 2012 campaign (it's the first option)."

'Conservatives' wouldn't necessarily be the ones responsible for shutting down the space program and lying to the people in that scenario. We don't know who created those policies but they aren't motivated by simplistic understandings of ideological temperament. Cooper's attitude about the whole thing is very conservative, and his view the lens through which we see the movie. It's not about the natural evolution of humanity for him. It's about preserving traditional family values and what America used to be capable of.   If we had to leave the planet as a matter of political policy there would be plenty of 'conservative' figures like Newt Gingrich who would be all for it."

The NASA from the book is a NASA more like that of the sixties or seventies. It has a reliable budget supporting the Ares program; enough that it was able to build the Hermes, the single most expensive object NASA has ever constructed. And it has guaranteed funding for Ares and Hermes for a minimum of three, possibly four more missions. Further, Ares isn't NASA's only mission. NASA's director mentions at least one major interplanetary mission in the course of the story; a project running parallel with Ares on its own rather substantial budget. Also, China is depicted as having an active and robust space program, enough so that they are in the process of putting together an extremely advanced and ambitious deep space mission on their own. While it is partially a propaganda exercise, it is intended to do real science. The Chinese space program is depicted as generally competent and very well organized, impressing the NASA administrators."
TrueFilm,3axzqz,BrainSlurper,0,Wed Jun 24 16:42:34 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you've brought this up. I haven't seen Tomorrowland, so my comments are about Interstellar.   I totally agree that Interstellar seemed to too quickly jump on the idea that a particular kind of progress was the only solution to Earth's ills. At one point the principal says something to the effect of ""We don't need engineers, we need farmers."" The film seems to suggest that we can be astronauts or farmers, but that science and progress can't be achieved in a sustainable or closed system context. You would think that there are types of engineers and scientists that could work on solving the agricultural issues that the world in the film is facing, but that is not glamorous work.  Aside from an unnuanced perspective on scientific progress, Interstellar also seems to ignore the saving potential of conservationism. (I'm not sure if this is what you mean when you say 'conservatism'). In Interstellar, Earth is just broken. There is no consideration that perhaps humans broke it, or even that we might have the capability to adapt or create solutions. It is a system beyond our control and influence, and so there is no point for us to stay behind and try to fix it. Even if we cannot fix it, perhaps there is a new way of life that could develop that is adapted to the new reality.  I'm sure it's been mentioned before, but Interstellar is unabashedly supportive of the potential and benefit of technology and mixed about the moral mettle of humans. CASE and TARS are likeable and amazing machines that are able to save the fallible and limited humans, either to save Amelia Brand on the water planet, to help coordinate an impossible docking, or even to gather data from the black hole and translate it into morse code. So much of the mission would have failed without their help. Indeed it is only humans (the elder Dr. Brand and Dr. Mann) who commit the most significant acts of lying and deception. In contrast to other films that are skeptical of the technology that we create, Interstellar can barely contain it's enthusiasm.  In some ways I feel like Interstellar, in a manner similar to Dr. John Brand, is not honest about the assumptions it makes in order to force the characters and the audience to agree that interstellar travel is the best and only solution. Crop blight just is, and we should not buckle down and find a new way of life, but we should run away. We shouldn't learn to manage the resources we have, but just find a new planet with new resources. But what happens if we exhaust those too?  At one point the elder Dr. Brand says something to the effect that ""We're not meant to save the world. We're meant to leave it."" It turns out he's lied about a few things, but the movie seems to agree with that assessment: the mission allows for humans to leave earth and settle on other planets and space stations (How building a space station with farms is easier than building an enclosed station on earth with farms is beyond me).   I think that the flaws in the film's approach to progress and conservation tie into the, in my view, failure of the third act (The Tessaract). I thought it would have been a structurally better film if Cooper had died in the black hole. If he had died then his sacrifice would have had more significance with respect to Brand. That section also introduces a set of plot points that seem merely to ensure that there is a happy ending to the mission and the movie. But if Cooper had died, then I think the movie would have been more powerful in another way. His death would have prevented humans, aside from the younger Brand, from leaving earth. What if it turns out that we were not actually meant to be an interstellar species? What if the whole mission was the exercise in hubris it seemed to be? Leaving humans on earth and in the theatre seats to wrestle with the reality that in all likelihood this is the only planet we will ever have, is to embrace ethical constraints and to wrestle with our responsibility to the planet and each other. Something that the apparent success of what OP calls the reckless progress narrative undercuts."
TrueFilm,3axzqz,JohnFrankford,8,Wed Jun 24 13:55:57 2015 UTC,"I think you guys are getting too held up on the practicalities and not seeing the bigger picture. Much like 2001, interstellar is principally about the elevation of mankind. Sure, humans might be able to survive in a limited capacity once the planet ran out of oxygen, but the movie is trying to say that being content with that is forfeiting what Nolan/Kubrick believe to be the next logical step in our evolutionary path.   I thought it would have been a structurally better film if Cooper had died in the black hole. If he had died then his sacrifice would have had more significance with respect to Brand. That section also introduces a set of plot points that seem merely to ensure that there is a happy ending to the mission and the movie. But if Cooper had died, then I think the movie would have been more powerful in another way. His death would have prevented humans, aside from the younger Brand, from leaving earth. What if it turns out that we were not actually meant to be an interstellar species?   I think you missed or at least misunderstood a significant portion of the movie here. If mankind does not leave earth, then there would have been no future humans to crash cooper's ship and to put the wormhole by saturn, which means he would not have been able to tell where the NASA camp was, which means the entire movie does not happen and we get to watch him farm corn for 3 hours. The movie would be nonsensical. That said, Nolan's original ending had Cooper dying after transmitting the data and the movie ending with the round ship leaving earth, which I think would have been a much better ending, but whatever."
TrueFilm,3atw8y,lordhadri,11,Tue Jun 23 13:55:30 2015 UTC,The score to Wrath of Khan was one of the first I ever obsessed over.  He will be greatly missed.
TrueFilm,3atw8y,Burbada,3,Tue Jun 23 14:59:56 2015 UTC,"I just watched it for the first time yesterday. Coincidentally, I heard that James Horner's plane had crashed while I was watching the film. Too crazy. I think I'll always remember bits and pieces of that score now."
TrueFilm,3atw8y,hrbuchanan,15,Wed Jun 24 01:32:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sure many will write a proper obituary by tomorrow but I'd like to say a few things.  I don't know whether or not James Horner was one of the great composers of film scores. I can't say because for as long as I can remember I've been indifferent to music as art, was never much into listening to it, studying it, or playing it. So as a child, some of the only music that ever got my attention were symphonic film scores, especially those composed by Horner. Many of the movies that were dearest to me as a young person and formative to my enthusiasm for movies have the common element of a James Horner score. I had a few CDs featuring orchestrations of his work that I listened to over and over. In some cases I knew the score very well before even I saw the movie.  Here are some of my favorites:  Main Titles from The Rocketeer  Re-Entry and Splashdown from Apollo 13  Main Title from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, which is very likely the best complete score to anything Star Trek related, and one of many reasons why it is still the best of a 12-movie franchise.  The Mask of Zorro  Braveheart - I probably like this main theme more than the movie itself.  The Great Migration from The Land Before Time.  Many will easily recall his work on James Cameron's last two movies Titanic and Avatar as well. Like I said, I don't know a lot about music, but I think it's safe to say that Horner's collaboration was a major reason why any of the above movies worked as well as they did. How often can we say that about film scores, especially so consistently and with so many different kinds of movies?   Avatar was probably Horner's last score that can be easily recalled in the memory, you can listen to it in full here. I was re-listening to it this morning and struck by how much it really did to create the personality of a movie with a premise that many find difficult to accept. I think that shows how both Cameron and Horner knew how music needed to function in order to make that story work for the audience. Even many of the blockbuster-type movies that I love don't have that quality, but Horner at his best could help make movies with silly or familiar stories feel like something really special.  That's why his tragic passing is unusually upsetting to me. He wasn't an old man yet, and aside from any work he had already completed, we will not get to hear his scores anymore on upcoming movies that might need them. I'm sure Fox will hire Michael Giacchino or somebody to finish the scores for Avatar 2 and they'll do good work, but even so, it probably marks the end of an era for that sort of film scoring."

TrueFilm,3atw8y,KennyFulgencio,5,Tue Jun 23 20:45:52 2015 UTC,"Right, and I know it's a common (not universal) symptom of Asperger's (or possibly autism generally); the part that makes me really curious is why we naturally appreciated symphonic movie scores, but have to actively work to appreciate other styles.  My dad, never diagnosed on the autism spectrum--and by appearances he wasn't on it at all; I just noted a handful of striking symptoms, while he was alive--openly acknowledged that he'd ""never been able to appreciate music"" (this was before he, or I, would have been able to locate that as a symptom of anything; it was just a trait without connection).  My mother had roughly the standard level of appreciation for music (not like a musician, not a cultured ear, but she liked and listened to popular music).    As their genetic product, I like some other forms of music now, beyond movie scores (though I'm well into adulthood), but I had to train myself through very extensive exposure, whereas my peers seemed to appreciate popular music with much more ease and far less training.  The only one I seemed to have ingrained from very early childhood was emotional connection to movie scores... like I saw Superman maybe a dozen times in the cinema with my granny, and I've always loved that John Williams score.    (potentially noteworthy because it wasn't just some random movie score, it was one of the best scores by one of the best composers, and I was 4-5, so maybe between my early neuroplasticity, the high quality of the music, and my repeated exposure, it trained me to be open to appreciating that genre in particular.)  What is it about us--and what is it about original scores for movies?"
TrueFilm,3atw8y,costofanarchy,5,Tue Jun 23 20:52:37 2015 UTC,"I have my theories about that which may at least be true for me. The first is that a lot of the music I do like is very rhythmic and percussive and some kinds of film scores fit into that category. It's not just the orchestral kind though; the musical judgment I do have tells me that Mad Max: Fury Road isn't all that good for a film score but I listened to it over and over anyway. Also, licensed tracks can have a similar effect; I didn't get into The Prodigy until I saw Kick-Ass.   So my other theory goes like this: the way other people supposedly experience music inside their bodies is something that never happens for me but I think it must be like watching a good movie. The way the artforms are composed is related but done in different mediums. Coincidentally I heard a Bernard Herrman interview today in which he stated he didn't really know why movies seem to require music to work, but they typically do. So I think seeing the visuals work together with the music helps me interpret it better, and I can still do that listening to it again when the movie isn't on. (I assume anyone can do that.) But it is really pretty rare for movies, even very good ones, to do that well. Here's my favorite example. Bad quality but you'll get an idea, and that piece wouldn't mean much to me if I'd heard it before seeing the film.  It's still beyond me how musicians can stand for something other than just what they play though. I don't really have a favorite band or song and people treat you weird if the answer to both was film-related because that's not what they meant. I never heard there was an autism spectrum connection but even if that's true I wouldn't make a big deal of it as the explanation. I do listen to music at work to keep me awake now but otherwise I've long preferred intellectually stimulating talk shows and audio drama, or just being comfortably silent."
TrueFilm,3atw8y,KennyFulgencio,3,Tue Jun 23 23:24:24 2015 UTC,"Unitil I was around 18, I would have described myself like yourself, /u/lordhadri, or /u/Zordman; I wasn't particularly drawn to music, with film scores being a notable exception.  Then for a few years, music played a relatively big part in my life, and I became a fan of a few dozen artists (contemporary and otherwise, from a variety of genres).  These days, I've again drifted away from music for the most part, although that's a more conscious choice.  I think for me it was just a matter of exposure.  The vast majority of the music I was exposed to at a young age didn't ""click"" with me, so I thought I had no particular affinity to it.  Film scores from films I particularly enjoyed may have been an exception because I had an emotional frame of reference for (and connection to) the music, by way of the film.  Also, if I saw the film multiple times, exposure would make the music familiar to me in a good way.  Later on, through the recommendations of a few friends, I found enjoyment in other kinds of music, ranging from the popular to the more niche.  The vast majority of this music, however, sounded different than whatever I had been exposed to frequently on the radio.  Interestingly about a year before I got into music, I was passively listening to a lot of the music I would end up liking by being a passenger in a friend's car.  He'd constantly be playing the same handful of albums, so over the course of a few months, I had probably heard a few dozen hours of this music.  I don't know if any of the music particularly stood out to me.  But once I sat down and listened to those albums later, over time, at his suggestion, and without distraction.  I developed an affinity for them.  Some albums took at least two or three listens before they really clicked.  So I think musical taste has a lot to do with exposure.  I feel pretty bad for derailing this thread now..."
TrueFilm,3atw8y,costofanarchy,4,Tue Jun 23 21:18:50 2015 UTC,"Please don't.  I think it's a very valuable issue to discuss (for a small section of the population like us I think it may be extremely informative, helpful, and validating).  I had a pretty isolated childhood was culturally illiterate; when I was 13, I used a bootleg radio to listen to the nearest big top-40 station while I was reading or screwing around on my computer; I left it on in the background so I Was hearing it nonstop for months, and since it's top 40, it was extremely repetitive, even more than what you experienced.  I did, slowly, learn to have a nuanced emotional response to popular music, which I'd never had before--before, it had felt roughly the way traditional Chinese music sounds (to untrained and ungifted western ears), like, uh, that's an interesting sound, but that's as nuanced as it gets--it all falls into the category of ""that's an interesting weird sound"".    That was my reaction to popular music before intentionally massively exposing myself so that I could learn it somehow.  And after months of listening, I did develop a basic range of emotional response to the spectrum of themes and approaches in top 40 music.  The two other genres I developed appreciation for were classical (in a very general sense, though Rossini and Beethoven were the ones I had the most emotion in response to), and non-top-40 rap.  At first it was just stuff that wasn't in regular rotation, and eventually it was actual semi-underground stuff.  The bit that I think might be a good key informational piece, for other people who share our somewhat handicapped but earnest feeling of musical appreciation--when I was first exposed to a lot of (non-top-40) rap, I was in a very emotionally open and vulnerable state; I was in high school and had been invited to ride around in the car with the most popular kid in school, and that was the music he listened to.    I wanted to be like him, so I was extremely sensitive to what his behaviors were, and the bass-pumping music was a big part of that.  It seems self-evidently significant that my emotional vulnerability and ""seeking"" state helped me become susceptible to an unusually large (for me) range/degree of sensitivity to rap--and I continued to listen to it for years, somewhat intermittently--so that my sensitivity to it continued to expand.  By contrast, when people say ""all rap is crap, anyone could make it"" or ""all country music is crap"" or ""I just can't stand opera but everything else is ok""--that's fine, but it's also obviously a consequence of their own undeveloped sensitivity toward that genre.  If you'd developed sensitivity and a range of emotional response to it, you might like it more or less than other genres, but you certainly wouldn't brush the entire genre off as ""crap that anyone could do""--that's as blatant a signal of selective musical blindness as anything can possibly be.  (Not that they selected it intentionally--I just mean they're neurologically adapted to receiving other forms of music, and have not been trained for any sensitivity at all toward this other particular genre, but rather than any self awareness of this limitation, they decide it's the fault of that entire genre of music... seriously all you can do is pity them)"
TrueFilm,3atw8y,Splagodiablo,3,Tue Jun 23 21:59:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing.  All this makes me think (and it's made me think the same before) that musical taste--- especially taste in instrumental music or music where the lyrics are not at the forefront---is largely arbitrary.  You mention rap, however, and I understand that the lyrics there can be quite important, but again, it probably depends on the particular piece.  This is probably an oversimplification or a reductive view.  All that said, I can't help but see music as something far more abstract than most films or novels (though experimental films, like those of Brakhage, can be more abstract than most commonly consumed music).  In narrative art, our life experiences, body of knowledge, interests, and attitudes on a variety of topics can affect how we respond to the work of art.  But assuming that we're not responding to the lyrical content in music (or other narrative content, if it's obviously present, such as Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf), it's really just an abstract organization of sound.  Organized sound, which can of course bring about a profound emotional reaction, but organized sound nonetheless, which isn't necessarily advancing a narrative of any kind.  And even if the artist had a narrative in mind when composing the work, this isn't necessarily conveyed to the listener.  I'd draw comparisons to abstract visual art, but I'm not too familiar with abstract art in those mediums."
TrueFilm,3atw8y,Womar23,5,Tue Jun 23 22:19:48 2015 UTC,"But assuming that we're not responding to the lyrical content in music (or other narrative content   Very recently (past month or so), I read someone with musical authority saying that even though it might be a controversial opinion, the lyrics of songs are generally of minor impact, and sometimes of entirely disposable importance, in the way the song is received and experienced by the listener (which is the primary goal of the artist--to construct a message which can be shared with some accuracy and depth, or at least to conduce a strong emotional response).  He was suggesting that if you can't understand all of the lyrics, or can't understand the lyrical theme and message of a song, it isn't necessarily a fatal blow to the song; that the message is very often conveyed by the music and the sound of the words (and perhaps key words and phrases) but that overall the content of the lyrics took a distant back seat, in the impression, the listener-understanding, experience, and communicated meaning of a song.  I don't remember that this was expanded on--it might have been intended toward pop music and not with operas in mind, I don't know.  I wish I remembered what the reference was."
TrueFilm,3atw8y,StrangeConstants,3,Tue Jun 23 23:00:29 2015 UTC,"I'm in agreement with this.  A lot of big music fans I know don't even know all the lyrics of many of their favorite songs, let alone songs they simply enjoy.  This was true for me, anyway.  It depends on the genre of music, of course, lyrics are more clear in some songs than in others.  Sometimes the vocals are just another instrument, really, even if actual words are being sung.  I also agree that sometimes key words can play a big part, and the rest of the words just provide additional texture.  I never looked into operas too much, but I imagine it applies there too, but to a different extent.  You might need to be familiar with the general story of the opera, but not the exact words being sung."
TrueFilm,3av9xn,diceman89,16,Tue Jun 23 19:59:09 2015 UTC,Have you ever identified with any revenge movie?  Any movie where someone close to the protagonist dies or gets significantly threatened and the protagonist then goes on to seek justice via violence?  Think about movies where a protagonist responds to a personal tragedy by breaking the social contract and and acting outside the law and where you have responded positively to the portrayal.  Do The Right Thing is almost certainly a milder and less transgressive story than those.
TrueFilm,3av9xn,SleepingSheeperson,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:29:18 2015 UTC,"It's not really a revenge movie, but Taxi Driver by Martin Scorsese can be broken down into a man acting outside of a social contract and being labeled a ""hero"". If a black man were to decide to clean the scum and the police found him covered in blood he would be coined as a bad guy, but because it was a white man killing degenerate street scum the portrayal is much more positive. I guess this post is in response to yours and OP's.   Travis wasn't a hero, he was a sociopath with good publicity, but people can easily identify with him than if it were a black male."

He's definitely referring to Radio Raheem.  ""I'm not advocating violence, I'm saying I can understand it. If the people are frustrated and feel oppressed and feel this is the only way they can act, I understand."" - Spike Lee  I'd say that, to Spike Lee, it's not a question of whether or not rioting is or is not productive in rectifying the immediate situation. Rather, doing so is justified in response to horrific violence and perhaps instrumental for the goal of ending police brutality toward minorities, even if it's not the most efficient or best possible reaction.  EDIT: Of course, the dual quotes at the end of the film help understand his position, as well.  ""Violence as a way of achieving racial justice is both impractical and immoral."" - Martin Luther King, Jr.  ""I don't even call it violence when it's self-defense; I call it intelligence."" - Malcolm X  Lee included both for a reason. I believe it was at the Cannes panel preceding its theatrical release where he said you ""can't have one without the other."" While violence is perhaps not the most practical or moral method of achieving racial justice, how can we blame someone for not wanting to sit there and take it for hundreds of years, hoping that lobbying and legislature will rectify the situation in time to prevent more of their children from dying?  I'm certain the above reflects his views after having researched this topic extensively; I am also fairly certain the Malcolm X quote wasn't included as the film's ""final word"" by accident."

Part of what makes it good art is that it doesn't really tell us how to feel about the choice Mookie made, even though Spike certainly has his own opinion. I've always felt that Mookie's expression is calm because he's resigned himself to this moment, no matter if it makes sense (is rational) or not. His calmness is part of what I love about this scene - he very deliberately makes the choice to be angry and violent. It's not a crime of passion, it's one of resistance.

But yeah, I mean violence - not ""civil unrest"" in the classical MLK sense. I mean that when the white establishment started seeing the black panthers arm themselves in response to police violence they figured they could either go with The Good Reverend or possibly have a genuine armed socialist revolt on their hands.

He knew them, and he knew they were racist, but the riot takes the focus off of the individuals, who aren't really the problem, even though they are racists.  Systems and institutions are the problem, whether they're restaurants or government services. The Pizza place sets itself up as a center for the black community, but run by white people, and rooted deeply in white culture (specifically Italian American--the photos of white people on the wall, preference for white music) and it foists its own moral and cultural values on this community, so it's sort of an allegory for the United States generally.   When you're making movies, it's usually good for the principal characters to take a big part in the plot.  If Mookie hadn't thrown the trash can, then the movie wouldn't have been about Mookie from the beginning. That was literally his arc, so saying someone else should have thrown the can is just saying it should have been a different film. I don't think that's a valid criticism, but I get that this film makes a lot of white folks really uncomfortable."
TrueFilm,3av9xn,radii314,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:14:06 2015 UTC,"I've heard that argument since day one and it is a cop-out for Lee's bad writing.  What makes slow, dumb zombies better than fast, smart zombies in horror movies is that you can outrun them but they never, ever stop coming. It is the slow, inexorable creep of danger that is scary and can serve thematically as a stand-in for creeping fascism (substitute other metaphors as you like).  The notion that Italians who run a business in black communities should play black music, put pictures of black people on the wall and basically de-Italianize, de-white their business because of the demographics of where it is located is laughably absurd. I supposed every Korean market should do the same and all Mexican restaurants in predominantly black areas should sell soul food including bean pies.   A restaurant, particularly one that is a social hangout in the neighborhood, is not a system or an institution - it is just a food place run by a family in the case of the pizza place in the movie. This is why so many people ridicule those who burn down their own communities when they want to protest. Who ain't gettin' pizza now because you burned down the pizza place?   Now you remind me of an actually relevant example of reaching out to the community you serve as a small business owner that can apply. After the LA riots we all learned that in Korean culture they don't like to touch (even other Koreans), so when they made change for a customer the would drop the change into the customer's hand and avoid touching skin to skin. Since a lot of Korean markets serve black communities in LA this would perceived as racism - Ooh, those Koreans won't touch us ... and a lot of black people are very warm and affectionate physically so touching is a big part of that, so Koreans perceived the black customers as overly familiar and touching in way they were not used to in their culture and black customers felt they were condescended to despite spending their money.  Do the Right Thing has several problems because Lee is smug and pretentious and it comes through in his movies. The ""Tawana told the truth"" which lingered full-frame for a few seconds is the most egregious of Lee's pretentions in that film. Even then there were doubts about little Tawana's truthfulness.   What would have been perfect is if during that tense moment where Mookie stared down the Italian white guys at the pizza parlor (for whom he worked and made money) some unknown faceless person in the crowd smashed the window and let the lid off the boiling tension because that's how riots actually work and like the slow, inexorably creeping zombies poverty and the desperation of any and all economic underclasses never goes away."
TrueFilm,3av9xn,radii314,3,Fri Jun 26 00:31:23 2015 UTC,"This was a local film from Brooklyn.  You want a black run business in Brooklyn in the '80s? No one's going to extend you a line of credit, so there are no black businesses in Brooklyn in the '80s.  Things haven't actually changed that much. That's just history.  You're valuing private property over community. That's what the film was about.  These people spend all their time at the restaurant, and it's a cultural fixture for them.  The restaurant is only Sal's in a financial sense.  In a deeper, spiritual sense it's a center for a community of people.  Lee is commenting on the inherent discord between private property and community. This is a central point of the film, and it doesn't work if you miss that.  A company is most certainly an institution, whether it's in food services or financial services. That's just how it is.  I used to live in that area of LA. I also spent a lot of time in East Asia. Those Koreans, though a lot of them saw what was really going on, were definitely racist, whether or not the hand thing had anything to do with it.  But inevitably there are gonna be culture clashes,  that's not the root of the problem.  If you think that's the reason behind the riots, you're kidding yourself.  They were called the Rodney King riots, not the Koreans won't touch us riots.  But middle class Koreans definitely bought into lower class areas of town, an opportunity most locals didn't have. This is not totally dissimilar to the situation in the film. How would you like it if every business that you had access to treated you like you were a potential criminal threat?  The ""smug and pretentious"" critique is wrong, and that lingering full frame is a reference to trends in African American film before Lee, and it's not the only shot taken from that genre that Lee uses to ground himself in the tradition of Black East Coast film making.  I don't see how your ending makes any sense at all.  The film is essentially about why riots start, so if you don't make any connections, personalize the story of why riots start, there's no point to the film. You're not getting that Mookie's role from the first minute he's on screen is to personalize the story of why riots happen."

Lee was a known up-and-coming filmmaker from She's Gotta Have It so although he chose to concentrate his films' storytelling in Brooklyn as it was then it doesn't mean he was a ""local"" filmmaker - he had an international reputation by then and after the shall we say uneven School Daze the film fans were really wondering what was next when Do the Right Thing came out.  Tawana did not tell the truth and that was pretty widely believed even back then, so Lee choosing to put a front-page news story in real-time into his fictional tale was a declarative statement. And in hindsight makes him look more pretentious because he was flat-out wrong.   I simply disagree that a single family-owned business is an ""institution"" but do agree that larger businesses and certainly corporate entities are institutions. The characters in that story may have regarded the pizza place as a neighborhood institution in the familiar - but that's on the emotional level not the socioeconomic.  As for business opportunities for blacks in that area at that time being restricted, absolutely but is that the fault of those who get preferential treatment? The Italians in that pizza joing probably never considered that black business people could not have opened in that location, they just went after it and got it.  Sal spent most of his time and his sweat-equity at the business and interacted with mostly black customers and social contacts, so it was more than just a business to him. He gave of his time and his hard work and put himself among strangers so he could be looked upon as someone making an investment in the community rather than one simply exploiting it - it rubs both ways.  Yes racism exists everywhere in the world and always has - the ""other"" is suspect until known. As a little white boy from the only family in our part of western Oahu I got chased and bullied and beat until they got to know and like me (one guy never stopped). Racism is a factor but not the only factor nor should it be the only lens through which the issues you raised are viewed.  In terms of economics, since '89 over 60% of U.S. black folks are now middle class or better. Some are upper middle class and some are rich, and a few very very rich. But there is the left-behind core of 30+% that can't seem to escape the cycle of poverty. Europe is now experimenting with ""guaranteed income"" and hopefully we'll go that way too so people can cover basic needs and not be stuck in programs. Also, the political mood is now progressive and drugs will finally be shifted from a crime posture to a healthcare posture and we can release a lot of non-violent drug offenders from our prisons. There are moves to crack down on payday lenders and raising wages, so some of the fundamentals look to be falling in place to help raise poor blacks, and poor every other color up out of poverty."

These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it America has failed to hear?[...] it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice and humanity."""
TrueFilm,3av9xn,mcgrewf10,15,Tue Jun 23 21:42:12 2015 UTC,I wish people were more aware of this perspective during the recent Baltimore and Ferguson riots.
TrueFilm,3av9xn,keyboredcats,2,Wed Jun 24 04:51:22 2015 UTC,Excellent quote.
TrueFilm,3av9xn,mcgrewf10,7,Wed Jun 24 03:27:13 2015 UTC,"I feel that it's just a raw expression of rage from Mook. His friend was killed and he's ""mad as hell, and not going to take it any more"", so to speak. I think Lee is pointing out that white viewers are ignoring the death of a black man as a consequence of Mook's behaviour, instead thinking it's reactionary in respect to Sal.  But Lee's said a lot of stuff over the years that certainly doesn't make him sound like a reasonable, polite individual. The ending is open to a lot of interpretation."
TrueFilm,3av9xn,TBroomey,10,Tue Jun 23 22:34:46 2015 UTC,"I think Spike's point is that there are two senseless acts of violence at the end of Do the Right Thing. The murder of Radio Raheem and Mookie throwing the trashcan through the window. Why does the (white) audience question the latter while accepting the former without comment? Clearly murder is a more serious offense than property damage.   Of course, there is a reason why. We hear stories of racial violence against black people on a daily basis. It is not new or novel, and we disregard it out of hand. Racism will truly be over when an uninitiated white viewer watches Do the Right Thing and asks, with genuine perplexity, ""I don't get it. Why would the police kill Radio Raheem?"""
TrueFilm,3av9xn,TBroomey,2,Wed Jun 24 00:47:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know if ""senseless"" is the right term to describe Mookie's behavior in the film's climax, his intentions are certainly transparent during that sequence (and he even explains them to Sal in the final scene).  Otherwise I definitely agree with you"
TrueFilm,3av9xn,keyboredcats,2,Wed Jun 24 08:52:15 2015 UTC,"If that's really Spike's point, then I think he's either overthinking or not thinking about it enough. The reason that people would concentrate more on Mookie's actions is that his motives were questionable, where there was no good reason, given the circumstances, for the police to kill Radio Raheem. People are in total agreement that that was the wrong thing to do, so Mookie's actions are the ones that make for a better examination."
TrueFilm,3av9xn,keyboredcats,2,Wed Jun 24 13:12:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can dismiss this as a matter of character motivation. If that were the case then - taking Spike at his word that only white people ask the question - why are black people not puzzled by Mookie's motivations? There is a racial divide in the way people relate to Do the Right Thing, and that seems to be symptomatic of something deeper. It may be reductive to call it racism (anyways Do the Right Thing is a movie that is supremely uninterested in these kinds of easy labels), but it is something."
TrueFilm,3av9xn,keyboredcats,3,Wed Jun 24 13:41:43 2015 UTC,So you think he's actually upset that people think it's more for Sal than out of anger over Radio?
TrueFilm,3av9xn,OnlyLoveNow,2,Tue Jun 23 22:43:08 2015 UTC,"That's what I get from it. Lee's definitely the kind of guy that gets worked up when people add their own reading of his work, he's really protective in that way."

TrueFilm,3av9xn,radii314,5,Tue Jun 23 22:48:42 2015 UTC,"My general approach to Lee is to enjoy his work, but ignore his personality. I did a college project on Do the Right Thing and some of the interviews I watched with him really rubbed me the wrong way. He manages to be both insecure but also overly confident at the same time. It's almost impressive in a way."
TrueFilm,3av9xn,SamisSimas,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:53:31 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that when people say Mookie defended Sal it sort of implies that they feel his character is somehow above the barbaric behavior of his peers, that he saved them from ""doing the wrong thing"".  That's problematic when the film's intention is not to condemn their behavior, yet racial prejudice is so ingrained in many viewers that they somehow feel the climactic scene is tonally ambiguous.  It's like if I watched Super Size Me and then wanted to get McDonalds afterwards, except far more toxic when real human rights are involved.  I absolutely understand Lee's frustration here."
TrueFilm,3av9xn,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:00:54 2015 UTC,But shouldn't we condemn they're behavior?
TrueFilm,3av9xn,SamisSimas,2,Wed Jun 24 11:27:28 2015 UTC,"No because they acted in response to a barbaric murder committed by the police officers tasked with protecting them.  We get to watch them from the comfort of our living room and say ""hey, Sal seemed like a good guy, they shouldn't destroy his business"" because the film doesn't glamorize Radio's murder and therefore doesn't affect us to the extent that it would have affected the actual residents of Bed Stuy in the film.  We root for kids who stand up to their bullies and fight back, we root for Keanu Reeves in John Wick while his senselessly murders hundreds of dudes just like him because some loser shot his dog, why can't we defend the behavior of Mookie and his friends when it's infinitely more justified?  Sometimes, when I'm really angry I punch a wall.  If I grew up under constant racial oppression and watched my friend get murdered by the police over a minor argument, I imagine I could hit that wall a lot harder."
TrueFilm,3av9xn,TriumphantGeorge,-1,Wed Jun 24 20:55:16 2015 UTC,"So if the police killed a man in your neighborhood, and a mob decided to take out their frustration by burning your house down, you'd be ok with that? Sal was not responsible for Radio Raheem's death, so how can you say they were justified in destroying his property? If they were going to be angry at some one, it should have at least been towards the people who actually deserved it."
TrueFilm,3av9xn,radii314,2,Wed Jun 24 20:58:52 2015 UTC,"That's a straw man argument because that isn't what happened.  Sal instigated the conflict with Radio Raheem that indirectly led to his murder.  Throughout the film we see passing acts of racial profiling that don't get given much attention because they're so commonplace in Mookie's neighborhood.  But they obviously have an impact on the residents, and there's a bubbling ""us vs them"" mentality that arises because of them.  While Sal's sons are either racist or socially clueless, Sal seems to be the white confidant that the neighborhood can trust.  He seems to genuinely like his patrons, hires a Black delivery boy, and treats him as a family member.  And yet, in a minor conflict, that façade is shattered as Sal shouts racist epithets at Raheem shortly before his death.  Instantly, the entire community is disillusioned with Sal, and perhaps even with any White folks that seem to be friendly towards Blacks. He's a conman, a fake, and just as prejudiced as the guy who tells the kids not to spray his car with the fire hydrant hose.  So of course Mookie and his friends are angry with Sal, and of course they associate Raheem's murder with him when he exhibited the same malicious and aggressive behavior as the police man who murdered him.  To say Sal was in the wrong place at the wrong time is to say his prejudiced core is somehow exempt from criticism because he was pretty chill for the first 90 minutes of the movie."
TrueFilm,3atunq,TommyWisaeuLovesYou,80,Tue Jun 23 13:41:09 2015 UTC,"There are three types of bad films.    There are the bad films that are intentionally bad.  Birdemic is in this category.   I have no joy in watching a bad film in which the director and screenwriter is in on the joke.   It is a waste of time.  There are bad films that are unintentionally bad, but are sluggish and boring.  The filmmakers really thought they had a good film in them, but nothing works, and worse, the pacing is off, the jokes don't connect, making it a real chore to sit through.  Dana Carvey's ""The Master of Disguise"" is a prime example of this.  Then... whoo boy... are those bad films that, while everything is bad, the magic between the director's misguided vision, the actors' misguided line readings, the atrocious dialogue... all coallesces and morbius strips upon itself into laugh-a-minute territory.  Even better, the pacing for these bad movies do not linger.  Plan 9 From Outer Space is the model in which Troll 2 and The Room are built upon.    Now excuse me, I DVRed ""The Swarm"" from TCM last week, and can't wait to rewatch that."

TrueFilm,3atunq,HannasAnarion,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:42:50 2015 UTC,"I stopped thinking about it like this. It's probably pretty common for someone making a movie to know they're working with mediocre material and crew but make the minimal effort to make it goofy on purpose so that the audience will at least be amused by it. In other words those good-bad movies don't happen by accident; sure, maybe the directors of Troll 2 will defend their integrity by saying they wanted the movie to be good, but why should we believe the things that make it fun aren't a result of that impulse on their part? The Room is a melodrama, not a very well-done one, but it's at least trying to be that way for a reason so that the audience can enjoy it.  One of the most artistically and philosophically worthless movies I've seen in years was Winter's Tale but I can see why if people were trying to get a movie done without the resources and time they needed for it to be any good, they all at least tried to have fun with it and maybe when that happens the audience can have fun too. It doesn't make the movie worthwhile because it's no substitute for a properly constructed drama. (or satirical comedy.) But compare that to Monuments Men, which doesn't look or sound like a Plan 9 - style bad movie, in theory it had all the parts it needed to work, and it amounts to something culturally harmless, yet it's creatively dead inside and therefore no fun to watch at all.   I like bad movies, but only the first kind described here. Sometimes, when the ;execution' is right, such movies are actually very good movies. Conan the Barbarian has ridiculous looking special effects and goofy acting, yet John Millius knows exactly what he's going for and the result is a terrific action-adventure movie."

TrueFilm,3atunq,jtreezy,11,Tue Jun 23 18:28:31 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of movies I love that don't have particularly well crafted narrative structure, but I don't really like the idea of labeling ""so bad they're good"" or anything like that.  Sometimes how unpolished and roughly cobbled together is part of the joy of watching them, but the level of ""badness"" does not correlate with how fun they are to watch, otherwise there would be a huge market for home movies and failed student films.  For example, some of my favorite ""bad"" movies are the cut and paste ninja movies by director Godgrey Ho and producer Joseph Lai (Trailer for Ninja Terminator).  And while I wouldn't exactly call these films well crafted, I do think they're kind of brilliant in their shameless commercialism and go for broke attitude.  Basically these guys distributed a lot of low budget action movies from asian countries with smaller film industries in the 1970s.  In the 1980s when VHS came about there was a huge demand for Ninja movies.  So they got a bunch of European actors filmed them for 10-15 minutes of plot, then put their expert stuntment in Ninja costumes and filmed tons of awesome Ninja action scenes.  They then edited this footage into their catalog of old 1970s action movies and then dubbed over them to make the plot make some kind of sense, and often tried to connect the newly filmed footage with the original footage by having the characters from both movies talk to each other in dubbed telephone conversations.  And they made tons of money off this scheme and churned out hundreds of movies.  But they weren't just trying to dupe American and European audiences into thinking they were buying a high budget action film with western stars, they also made really fun movies.  Oftentimes the original source material was already pretty trippy, and adding crazy ninja plotlines just made them all the more thrilling to watch.  And whats extra fun is that they actually tried to make the plot make sense even though they didn't need to.  And theres tons examples of these sorts of cut and paste movies that don't try to reconcile the plots of their source material and they're much more difficult to watch.  Now the films could've been much worse if they didn't try to have the plots make sense, didn't hire competent stunt actors, and didn't use crazy costumes and set decoration that often have the words ""ninja"" or pictures of ninjas on them (in case you werern't sure these were ninjas in their ninja hideout the lamp shades with pictures of ninjas on them and their headbands that say ""Ninja"" will help you out.)  But they're ridiculously fun because the filmmakers were trying to hard to jam the movie with all the cool stuff they could with so little resources available to them.  In general I don't really derive much fun by mocking how incompetent a filmmaker is (and maybe I do on occasion for something like The Room, though I still think the reasons for it being so fun are more complex than just being ""bad"".)  Fillmmaking is tough work, and thousands of films don't measure up to what we would call ""good"" and are usually uninteresting to watch.  What I love though is feeling complicit with a filmmaker who has no resources, no experience or training, and is just  shamelessly putting together every resource or angle they can exploit to get a bunch of people to watch their film."
TrueFilm,3atunq,drevill,6,Wed Jun 24 06:53:13 2015 UTC,"To me bad films can be categorized into the obviously bad and the subtle bad.  The obviously bad is just that. By just looking at the trailer*, we can tell that a movie is going to be atrocious: terrible acting, terrible directorial work, terribly dialogue, etc. Transformers, the majority of Adam Sandler's films, and The Room (which at least it an enjoyable bad) are great examples.   - EDIT: The first twenty minutes of the movie can also give this away   The subtle bad is not so easy to spot. It's a badness that you have to think about over time. Take for example Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. The trailer indicated to fans at the time that this was going to be the Star Wars movie they had been waiting for since Return of the Jedi nearly two decades ago. But then on that fateful May day of 1999, people left the theater not knowing exactly what they watched, and couldn't exactly decide if it was a good or bad movie. Jar Jar Binks was terrible, sure, but even hardcore fans admitted that take Jar Jar out of the movie and The Phantom Menace was good. The Red Letter Media movies proved that theory wrong. Anybody want a pizza roll?"

I thought Sharknado was a bore to watch through because there was nothing genuine about it. I also disliked Kung Fury because it tried so hard to be 80s bad without knowing what 80s bad is. These movies also relied too much on Lel randuum humor which was a non-thing back in the 80s. Jaws 3, for example, didn't have random humor like flying sharks doing Kung-Fu but because of the stupid line delivery (you know which line I'm talking about) and the laughable effects and cliches. Nowadays you can make so bad it's good comedy by combining noun vs. noun or a portmanteau = random epic monster + random epic disaster.  I enjoy movies like Samurai Cop, The Room, Conan the Barbarian remake, Troll 2, and so on because I felt like there there was some honest filmmaking put there. Say what you will about the Room, but Tommy Wiseau is interesting enough to warrant a book written about him. Samurai Cop is funny not because lel random humour but because of the laughable filmmaking and the implications behind how they filmed their movies (The Wig, color temperature).

I'm not too interested in most Hollywood horror blockbusters but have loved a number of independent horrors I've seen though I have no idea whew to find more
TrueFilm,3aq3cd,poems_4_you,2,Tue Jun 23 01:08:53 2015 UTC,Bloody Distusting is a good site for some indie horror.
TrueFilm,3aq3cd,cptnhook,2,Tue Jun 23 13:34:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah movies can all be happy-go-lucky Disney flicks with happy endings. We need movies that mean something more and if that involves ""scarring"" (for lack of a better word) to get a point across or to create an emotional and memorable impact/ending then I do agree."
TrueFilm,3aq3cd,zachintyre,3,Mon Jun 22 23:45:40 2015 UTC,"Scar doesn't necessarily have to mean in a negative way, though. He's just talking about films making an impression of some kind, which is quite right IMO.   Yeah, perhaps that's what he was getting at, but he seems to be deliberate in his use of the word ""scar,"" ie hurt. After all, if he wanted to say, ""I'm always interested in movies that leave a deep impression on me"" he could have.  Then again, artists are frequently full of shit, so I'm not sure how seriously we should take him."
TrueFilm,3aq3cd,FloydPink24,28,Tue Jun 23 04:18:14 2015 UTC,"The word definitely has some kind of negative connotation, but there's something almost romantic about the movies scarring us in a weird, psycho-masochistic way."
TrueFilm,3aq3cd,Ayadd,11,Tue Jun 23 06:36:04 2015 UTC,"I think this is the crux, what does he mean by scar, and I think he is romantisizing it a bit. I mean, my personal favorite director is Aranofsky because of movies like Requiem and Black Swan, watching those movies were viscerally difficult, and that was their power, and why to this day when ppl mention Requiem in conversation there is always a collective shrivle from everyone who's seen it, that's power and longevity that entertainment will never achieve."

TrueFilm,3aq3cd,PantheraMontana,18,Mon Jun 22 18:25:34 2015 UTC,"That specific quote seems a bit vague. It doesn't say that much for me. Sure, films that scar, make you feel something, stick with you or anything similar are usually those you remember the most and probably stick with you the longest than those movies that are mindless entertainment that you forget about the next day, but it can differ from person to person. People always look for different things in movies, it's always going to be that way. I think Michael Haneke had a great quote going on:        ""Films that are entertainments give simple answers but I think that's ultimately more cynical, as it denies the viewer room to think. If there are more answers at the end, then surely it is a richer experience.""     I have to say I agree with Haneke a lot."

TrueFilm,3aq3cd,rom211,20,Wed Jul 1 15:42:35 2015 UTC,"I think there's a place for everything. Lars Von Trier (not sure if that's the exact name)  has his own thing going on and although I'm not a fan of his,  he does have a following precisely because of what he is doing.   Fincher's quote rings true to his filmography. Sure there are big blockbuster movies that make tons of money but his movies are the ones that people can't seem to forget. I watched Gone Girl multiple times and I always enjoyed people's reactions to it. The movie was not about the occult or supernatural but it was more effective as a horror than most other films."
TrueFilm,3aq3cd,Slickrickkk,12,Mon Jun 22 20:57:05 2015 UTC,"I used to joke with my best friend that we would leave a scar on the world that would remain long after we were gone. We did not at all mean war, pestilence or any of that stuff - all we meant was to leave a lasting impact.  That's what Fincher's most likely talking about. Jaws impressed him so much that it changed his swimming habits for good. He doesn't want to churn out pulp for the masses that you forget about the very next day. He wants to ""scar"" people, have them thinking about the movie later on and even years later.   I am absolutely fine with his view. He's a director who wants to leave a scar on the world. Figuratively, not literally. And good for him, because people are not going to be talking about Michael Bay in 20 years - they'll be talking about Fincher's Se7en."
TrueFilm,3aq3cd,Dreadzy,5,Mon Jun 22 22:01:44 2015 UTC,Thank you.  I hate that most people don't enjoy a movie if it doesn't leave them happy.  If a movie leaves you sad or frustrated or disgusted that's okay.  Art evokes different emotions beyond happiness.

TrueFilm,3aq3cd,Epledryyk,7,Mon Jun 22 20:12:09 2015 UTC,"I really have a difficult time understanding how this can be interpreted as any of those. A film having an impact on you isn't immature, it's more like it was a good film. Don't just think of Jaws or the Exorcist, think of films like the Shawshank Redemption or Requiem for a Dream. Inspiring emotion from a movie is a difficult task, but when it happens it is something that will stick with you."
TrueFilm,3aq3cd,pgibso,2,Mon Jun 22 20:57:04 2015 UTC,"But Fincher didn't say ""have an impact"" or ""stick with you,"" he deliberately used the word ""scar"" and then used an example of psychological scarring -- fear of going into the water.   If he had said ""I really love movies that make a big impact on me"" we wouldn't be having this discussion b/c, as you point out, I don't think any reasonable person would object to that statement.  Instead, he deliberately contrasted scarring (ie something that hurts you) with entertainment, and implied the former is better than the latter."
TrueFilm,3aq3cd,damjancd,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:59:33 2015 UTC,"Those two examples that you used could not have been more bang on, especially Requiem for a Dream. The entire time I was reading this thread, all I was thinking about was that film. I have seen that movie one time, and I saw it many years ago; however, to this day I can probably recount almost every single detail. That movie more than any sort of education I received in school deterred me from doing hard drugs, it literally scared the shit out of me.   That being said, I too find myself more attracted to films that will ""scar"" me. Not because I'm angsty or emotional, but because I just simply find it more interesting. The term ""Hollywood ending"" has been coined because most movies end with a happy ending, and the ones that don't stand out.   I think more often than not in today's society the negative leaves a larger impact than the positive. It's why we only see awful stories being told on the news as opposed to positive ones, unfortunately people don't care as much about happy endings. But that's not to say that I can't find a movie like Dead Poet's Society to be amazing because it doesn't scar me, it just did not leave the same impact on me as the films that scarred."
TrueFilm,3aq3cd,HOtahiero,6,Mon Jun 22 21:10:47 2015 UTC,"This is the most Fincher thing Fincher could ever say.   As for the quote: It's okay. FilmCritHulk has written about how powerful film can be as a medium. I forget what documentary and country he talked about, but it was in light of The Act of Killing, and he talked about how an older documentary spawned a movement to end the death penalty in a European country. At the same time, Adam Sandler keeps making movies.  Point being, film has a great power to it that most people: a) don't understand b) don't know how to use c) don't want to use. I don't think every film should have an explicit message, and I don't think film needs to be ""responsible"" with what it shows. I think it's a shame, tho, that most directors just don't understand what it is they show on screen, either because of demands from the studio to get shit out as quickly as possible, or laziness."
TrueFilm,3aq3cd,TheRingshifter,5,Mon Jun 22 21:14:19 2015 UTC,"Fincher is talking from the position of an active filmmaker. How an artist talks about the medium is a completely different context than a critic. When he says what a movie should our should not do, he's talking about what gets him jazzed about creating. He's staying his values, not something universal about cinema. So whether or not it's an adolescent or reductive view is not the most important thing.  The more interesting reaction to the quote, I think, is using it as a prism of evaluating his films. I think it points out an interesting disconnect. He wants to scar the audience, for his movies to stick with them. And they do, but often in the way counter to the point he was trying to make. A good example is that a common reaction to Fight Club was, if not to actually start one, to think how cool it would be to be in a fight club. He made it so viscerally appealing in the movie that even when the text if is condemning that sort of toxic masculinity, it still comes off as celebrating it. But that sort of visceral reaction is also what he's after, since he used a physical analogy to describe his desired reaction."
TrueFilm,3aq3cd,Wolfhoof,3,Mon Jun 22 21:23:35 2015 UTC,"I never understood the ""Fight Club glorifies fighting position"" but I think that has more to do with me than the art itself. I guess I'm more sensitive to violence—I've only been in one or two true fights myself, and haven't particularly enjoyed them even though it's definitely a rush. I was, and some of the people I watched it with (all of the girls and one other guy) a little grossed out at Jared Leto's face reduced to a pulp for example. To me, when Tyler pulls a gun on an innocent man, and there's no music just the two protagonists and the guy's terrified reaction, was probably the turning point in the movie (though maybe I'd have to rewatch to be certain) where I realized it wasn't fun anymore. The comic tone remains but it's a bit darker.  If you (not you specifically, but a watcher in general) didn't find the terrorism of the second half slightly disturbing  then I feel like that's on the viewer, failing to apply a moral compass to the narrative. I think Fincher did his job which was to portray the Club as something the members wanted to be a part of to escape their shitty, average lives."

It's far and away my favorite Kar Wai, though I haven't yet seen 2046 due to not being able to track down a good copy easily. Chungking Express was a revelation to me as well, I feel it balances the playfulness of a Tarantino flick with hard-hitting emotions better than most any film I've seen.

Wong and his cinematographers paradoxically convey a bittersweet sense of intense loneliness and alienation in a world overflowing with people, sensation, and spectacle. The film captures, on a visceral, emotional, and stylistic level, what it’s like to be all alone in a crowd. This is accomplished partially through dreamy, elliptical editing, partially through camerawork that transforms the city into a disorienting blur of lurid neon, and partially through wall-to-wall narration that articulates the emotions at the core of this profoundly romantic and evocative film, while at the same time hovering above the action."

I would highly recommend checking  out Peter Chan's film Comrade's Almost a Love Story, which has Christopher Doyle not as Cinematographer but acting a side role as an English teacher.  Peter Chan's He's a Woman, She's a Man and He Ain't Heavy, He's My Father (A bit of a rip off of Back to the Future, but different enough to be appreciated on its own merits) are great as well.  And there's lots of other good Hong Kong New Wave and Second Wave directors like Tsui Hark, Ann Hui, Stanley Kwan, and Clara Law that are worth investigating."
TrueFilm,3apfut,Fission_Mailed,3,Mon Jun 22 14:31:22 2015 UTC,"One of the things the average fan doesn't know about Wong Kar Wai is that he is incredibly well funded, so he can spend ""seemly endless""amount of time reshooting his scenes (according to his line producer) . He often shoots films over years (not months and days), and scene might be re-shot several time until they're to his liking. One rumor I heard while working in China was that he re-shot the opening fight scene from Grandmaster some 28 times.   If you want to jump into other notable established asian directors with a unique style, try Tsai Ming Liang's ""Rebels of the Neon God* and Hou Hsiao-hsein's ""Millennium Mambo"""
TrueFilm,3apfut,knightmanmarcheson,2,Mon Jun 22 18:52:34 2015 UTC,"He's done some good stuff. With no doubt one of the best and coolest directors from Hong Kong for the moment. Maybe even overall. Chung Hing sam lam (1994), Fa yeung nin wa (2000) and Chun gwong cha sit (1997) are my favourites by him.Especially Fa yeung nin wa (2000) must be one of the best films post-2000. I really like the lightning in several of his movies and the use of colors. He's also good at contructing interesting characters that aren't simple and flat, but rather nuanced and at the same time giving the audience both small and fundamental questions about them. There's usually a lot of emotions in the films as well. I'm a bit curious and worried about his latest feature film, Yi dai zong shi (2013), the one about Ip Man, I have to see that one soon. It looks a bit different than some of his other movies. I'm not really a big fan of martial-arts films, so that could also be one reason for my hesitancy.      When it comes to tracking down Kar-wai's films on DVD, it's quite easy. Criterion Collection released Fa yeung nin wa (2000) on Blu-ray too. And his other ones shouldn't be too hard to find if you look on Amazon and similar sites. I'm happy to help if you have trouble finding something!           And if we are speaking of similar films, the ones I can think of for now are these three:          Bin-jip (2004) Kim Ki-duk's movies are mostly either a hit or a miss for me, but this one is probably his best. There's very little dialogue, but I find the relations of the characters to be something similar in the vein of the movies by Kar-wai.             Ai qing wan sui (1994) More dialogue than the Kim Ki-duk film, but Tsai Ming-liang is much better when it comes to having sparse dialogue. One must check out Tsai Ming-liang if one likes Wong Kar-wai! Ming-liang isn't as straightforward, but I always feel the need to recommend his films. And there's also that similar feeling when it comes to interactions with the characters.          Stranger Than Paradise (1984) Jim Jarmusch has that special coolness that we can see in Kar-wai as well. Very likeable stuff!

It's just so elegantly made, and such a nice mix of intrigue with a bit of comedy in it. PTU (2003) by Johnnie To - The most atmospheric HK crime movie ever made if you ask me. The Mission (1999) by Johnnie To - This is similar to the early Wong Kar Wai work in terms of setting and the wideangle lenses used but blended in with some John Woo flavours. A Simple Life (2011) by  Ann Hui - Very nice piece of Hong Kong cinema that is not crime or violence - instead it uses the film industry as a backdrop to tell a personal story about family relations."

TrueFilm,3aohk8,LancasterDodd,19,Mon Jun 22 05:06:13 2015 UTC,"No more dated than contemporary filmmakers who can often be seen ""employing a combination of zooms, dissolves, jump cuts"", I think it's more to do with the source material and whether are not it finds a connect with an audience.   PT Anderson could be mentioned in this context given his use of all the aforementioned techniques in a number of his films but one wouldn't say he is 'dated' filmmaker, just someone with an appreciation of old cinematic techniques in his modern narratives.   Ultimately, I think if this person suggested that Roeg is a dated filmmaker then I'd be interested to know whether this assessment originated from the fact he didn't find enough interest in the narrative components of the film itself to find full immersion. As this factor usually is the deciding factor whether or th viewer is able to transcend the aesthetic aspects of a film."
TrueFilm,3aohk8,woefulwank,13,Mon Jun 22 07:02:13 2015 UTC,"This seems like an odd comparison. Roeg's camera/framing/editing/lighting choices are far greater departures from the classical continuity style than PT Anderson has ever demonstrated. PTA's slow zooms and (very rare) barely-jump cuts, effective or ineffective as they may be, aren't the same kind of overt stylistic flourishes that Roeg uses. I find it plausible that the ""hyperlink cinema""/70s-revivalism in PTA's Boogie Nights or Magnolia might feel dated (oh so late-90's), but it seems like a fairly different issue, and anyway it seems unlikely to me.  Although immersion in a narrative often makes it easier to consciously ignore camera/editing/etc., I would suggest that we don't really want to ""transcend"" the aesthetic aspects of a film. The aesthetic is not merely a vehicle for communicating a narrative, but something that itself embodies and communicates meaning. Thoroughly engaging with a film ultimately means absorbing (at least unconsciously) how its aesthetics operate, not merely how they support some other thing.  I definitely don't mean to imply that filmmakers should only use classical continuity style, lest they be deemed dated later, just that it's fair ground to look at specific techniques used, reflect on their idiosyncrasies and conformance with ""schools"" and ""eras"" and evaluate them partly on that basis."
TrueFilm,3aohk8,poliphilo,14,Mon Jun 22 14:16:21 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like D'Angelo didn't give the content of the sort of films Roeg made in the '70s much consideration when he wrote this. It's true that his signature style incorporates techniques that have since largely fallen out of favor, but I'd argue that he used them to great effect, particularly in The Man Who Fell to Earth. One thing that immediately comes to mind is the way he uses associative editing to explore Newton's emotional landscape, or jump cuts to illustrate that this character doesn't experience time in the same manner humans do. Roeg was generally drawn to stories about people undergoing great emotional distress, usually as a result of removal from one's natural habitat or way of life. If his editing is jarring and calls attention to itself, more often than not, it adds to the feeling of distress, and therefore works in the film's favor.   I guess what I'm trying to say is, it ain't dated if it works."
TrueFilm,3aohk8,hadrijana,7,Mon Jun 22 08:07:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The techniques might feel dated, because of the way cinema has moved into more fast paced slick editing, but I would argue that Roeg uses his camera and editing in a more story telling way, than most filmmakers do today. There is a couple of people today that still do it like , De Palma, Scorsesce, Spielberg and Fincher, where they really use these techniques to convey the emotions of the characters or to serve the story.  A couple of good examples are used in every frame a painting on youtube about ""Seven"". Another good example would be De Palma´s ""Blowout where he uses jump cuts to tell us something about the directional microphones the protaganist uses in the film. Roeg is very much the same way. If he uses Zoom, jump cuts or some other technique, it´s most likely because the is trying to tell you or show you something.   Both Tarantino and Robert Rodr. use these techniques also, but more as a gimmick or as a stylistic ""effect""  But yes, seen in the perspective of young movie going audiences, they might feel dated."
TrueFilm,3aohk8,tapomirbowles,9,Mon Jun 22 10:34:30 2015 UTC,"I think there is an argument to be made that The Man Who Fell to Earth is dated but Roeg as a filmmaker in general? No way. The reason that TMWFTE feels so of its time is down to content, not form. From Bowie to the soundtrack, the costume down to the themes as a whole, the film taps into a seventies zeitgeist, the fear of consumerism and television swallowing us whole until we are a shell of our former selves and end up forgetting the most important things in our lives. If we are to blame the editing for this then do we also call Easy Rider dated? Or is that influential? How about Godard's Breathless? Or does that get a pass because of it's self aware style? I have to say, I disagree with Mike D'Angelo here.  Roeg's better films like Bad Timing or Don't Look Now, on the other hand, never felt dated to me at all. They are both existential works in which the fragmented editing and constant zooms and jump cuts all add to the fragmented reality of the protagonists as well as providing the audience with a unique framework to view the story from. Both of these films are particularly good examples of how radical editing can effect the way we view a narrative and if this is dated then so are people like Iñárritu or Lynch, directors that certainly took Roeg's concepts and ran with them."
TrueFilm,3aohk8,hydra815,6,Mon Jun 22 09:47:52 2015 UTC,"I'll defend D'Angelo's point, since several other people have taken the other side.  To shift the subject a little bit, let me talk about The Graduate (1967, 9 years earlier). Less arty, less auterist than TMWFtE; it uses a few of the same techniques (and coincidentally, Buck Henry). The Graduate continues to be liked, and watched, even while it is distinctively associated with the cinematic style, culture, and certain thematic concerns of its time. Since all those things read as distinctively 1967, the movie acts as a great time capsule as well as being a good film. There's value in that.  Yet, I think we can coherently say something like ""we wouldn't want to change that, because we'd lose something"" while simultaneously ""some of these elements don't perfectly fit what's happening.""  Sometimes the movie's awkward & unpolished, but in a way that isn't exactly the right sort of awkwardness..., e.g. a moment where a zoom-in doesn't express Ben's situation, or a moment when the ""film's attitude"" is vague rather than merely ambivalent. Why nitpick movies that we like overall? I think it is inextricable from watching deeply and appreciating fully; anyway, I think openness to a movie's imperfections is valuable in sort of a similar way to openness about imperfections in life.  Returning to Roeg, specifically TWMWFtE, I think we something similar applies. If you think he made a transcendentally great film, then greatness overcomes datedness in every practical way; iambic pentameter may be hard to read, but Shakespeare's artistic vitality and skill means that the friction we experience is hugely repaid. Otherwise, even if you like Roeg, you might recognize many places where the technique used wasn't quite the right one to artistically express what was happening, but rather one that felt ready at hand—because it was cheap, or something that he could get away with due to the sensibilities of his time.  Re: ""most severely dated"" -- hard to say. D.W. Griffith's cinematic technique ranges the gamut between deeply clunky and visionary perfection, while his moral sensibility is perfectly, awfully dated. I would be incredibly reluctant to say TMWFtE is more dated then that. But of all the movies of that 70s era, I think TMWFtE would have most improved in my eyes if I'd seen it in '76 rather than in the 90s. I think it's because all those faddish techniques are deployed roughly, casually, and relentlessly (not thoughtlessly though!) and because I found the actual thematic material, while sincere, to be too often superficially judgmental."
TrueFilm,3aohk8,poliphilo,5,Mon Jun 22 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"I think the reasoning behind this comes from the fact fact that our understanding of '70's style film making' isn't particularly defined by 2015. If you look at at a film like Casablanca, it is clearly stylistically a 40's film, and we know very clearly what the attributes and characteristics of a film made in that era are. Therefore it becomes easier to forget and ignore it's more dated elements, they even become charming in their own way. We don't really have that same idea about films made in the 70's in our public consciousness, thus it might feel less forgivable. I think crucially there is a point where 'dated' becomes 'charming', and the only way films can really make that leap is if they are ultimately good, I can't speak for The Man Who Fell to Earth but I have seen Roeg's Don't Look Now, and it does seem to suffer from the aforementioned issues, but it is a tense, scary, thrilling film albeit one that feels drenched in the aesthetic of the 70's. Importantly I feel that dated isn't strictly a bad film, it is an inevitability, and shouldn't imply anything about quality."
TrueFilm,3aohk8,Polythemus,2,Mon Jun 22 08:16:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's interesting to note just the concept of things being ""dated"" in the first place.  As mentioned in another thread, I'm on a Wong Kar-Wai kick, but it hasn't escaped my attention that many think he's a quintessential '90s filmmaker.  I'm secure enough that, even if it were true, I wouldn't like him any less, but it's interesting to think about.  What would make a director timeless?  I remember watching the trailer for The Wolf of Wall Street and reading somewhere someone saying ""that is not a trailer for a movie directed by a 70-year-old man.  And it was true."
TrueFilm,3aohk8,redditbutblueit,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:45:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's interesting you mentioned Wong Kar Wai because I do consider him very evocative of the 90s, but do not consider him or his style dated. I think what it comes down to is whether the things that tie a film to a particular time make hinder its relevance to a modern audience. It is fair to that both Wong and Roeg made film with specific relevances to their respective eras, I don't consider them dated."
TrueFilm,3aohk8,TriumphantGeorge,2,Wed Jun 24 03:19:01 2015 UTC,"The way I tend to view older films (assuming they are not period pieces of course) is to approach them as if they are set in the year they were made. Can I understand the film's choices in those terms?   If some aspects of the film have become incomprehensible (either in terms of content,  or directorial and editing choice) where before they were meaningful, then that would be a sign of something being ""dated"".  Stylistic choices in and of themselves therefore do not make something ""dated"". After all, fashions come and go and come back again. Even the latest Star Wars trailer has a fast zoom or two in it. Very 1960's...."
TrueFilm,3aoacd,GiraffeofPlaid,2,Mon Jun 22 03:50:22 2015 UTC,It's been a few months since I watched it but I remember the motif of America being present throughout. In the bank scene Travis looks through his binoculars towards a building and then pans around a bit until he focuses on an American flag.  Also one of the exterior shots of the strip club has a large mural of the Statue of Liberty painted on it.    I think this imagery works to reinforce the goal of German director Wim Winders to recreate a version of America from his perspective as an outsider.
TrueFilm,3aoacd,folhowk,3,Mon Jun 22 04:42:19 2015 UTC,I think Wenders himself called the film his personal love letter to America
TrueFilm,3aoacd,knightmanmarcheson,2,Mon Jun 22 09:57:58 2015 UTC,"It really does have a great variety of different textures of America.  Wenders must have a very keen sense of seeing a place not just for its sights, but the detailed aesthetics and lifestyles of the people within.  Things such as:   the empty desert and vast expanse of Texas far-rural Texas town shops and motels glitzy LA real LA (suburban life next to a noisy airport) gritty LA (crazy guy ranting on a freeway overpass) aging, sandblasted 50s kitsch California highways (Sinclar gas station dinosaur) big-business Houston the juxtaposition in Port Arthur between cool music clubs and seedy nudie booths"
TrueFilm,3amtws,Zeego123,9,Sun Jun 21 19:45:31 2015 UTC,"I think you are missing a lot. First of all, to understand Robert Bresson you have to forget all about how a film ""should be"". I suggest reading Notes sur le cinématographe (also published in English as Notes on the Cinematographer), there you will find his own kind of ""rules"", formulas and guidelines when it comes to cinema. He used it a lot in his own films. Robert Bresson despised the way in which the majority of films were made. He was of the opinion that the majority of cinema was filmed theatre, that's why he created a new sort of film language, his own cinematography. I would also suggest to not even think of comparing Lynch with him, that's just pointless from the beginning. Both of them have made some great films, but they don't have much in common at all. To make it easier, Bresson's style doesn't have much in common with much at all.             Bresson wanted to separate cinema from the theater, he stripped the cinema to only the bare essentials. He was quite interested in other artforms, such as literature and painting, so much in his style is influenced from those fields rather than film. Look at the acting for example. The people in Bresson's movies were called models by him, he didn't want to call them actors at all. The point with his kind of ""acting"" was to make the models say their lines in a kind of automatic way, which didn't have focus on them making a performance, but rather acheiving automatism. In my opinion, this also had an effect that made it subtle, powerful and raw. And therefore it also left room to fill the characters with your own emotions, aside from those you already got from the beginning.       The people in his movies were taken from life, Bresson required that they didn't have any connection to film or theater. Have in mind that I mostly speak of his later films now, his earlier movies were not made the same way. Anyways, he used people which were not taught to be natural. Classic acting had a learned naturalness, something which was absurd to him. The people in his films were supposed to be (models), not pretend to be (actors). Bresson even tried to not use the same model twice. Everything from the theatrical expressions was meant to be taken away, that was the point in which Bresson wanted to bring out the authenticity, a realism in the way of just being human. Facial expressions, movements, gestures and voices, everything was supposed to be as neutral as possible. This is something that was the total opposite of typical acting, because Bresson felt that typical acting was closer to the theater than to cinema. A person who has been indoctrinated in the theater when it comes to expression, that person can't show genuine emotions on screen, that would just be emotions that have been learned, which equals fake emotions. Bresson was interested in the purely ""physical"" in people. He didn't tell which feelings he wanted his models to show, he just gave them physical instructions such as how the model should move, what the model should look at etc.        He was also a perfectionist and a minimalist. That means every image, sound, move etc. is supposed to be there and has its own meaning of being there. This is why many of his movies are a bit shorter than your average flick. This guy stripped cinema to the bare essentials, but still managed to make huge art. The thing with Bresson is the special relationship between images and sounds together with important questions about human beings, it's so special that you won't really find it anywhere else, not like in his movies. It's just pure film magic in my opinion. Some people can watch films all their life and still not understand Bresson, which isn't shocking at all, because you really need to study his style to truly understand him, I'm almost certain that you barely scratched the surface of this man and his movies, especially if you think his visual style is ""dull"", that it's ""lacking"" and when you say you don't see the point. Study, read his book, watch his films, and examine critically. This can take years, but understanding Bresson isn't something you do after two or three of his movies. It takes time. We are not talking about taste now, have that in mind. We are just talking about understanding. I also have a great book about him by Ingela Romare, but it's in Swedish, so it's a bit hard to recommend if it isn't your first language. There may be something else you could find in English though (besides his own book). Anyways, If you have the interest to understanding Bresson properly, you have to commit and do it properly. Good luck if you want it. And don't rush."
TrueFilm,3amtws,Mothravka,9,Sun Jun 21 20:54:34 2015 UTC,"Just to counterpoint here, remember, it's OK not to like somebodies art. If you do a bit of reading and watch a few of his movies and you're still not feeling it, that's OK too, it's not a benchmark of intelligence. My initial reaction was much the same as yours. I went away, read the 'manifesto' etc, watched a few more...but his highly mannered style just does nothing for me, I feel no artistic or emotional impact, others may. Sometimes, you just have to go with your gut."
TrueFilm,3amtws,craig_c,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:58:33 2015 UTC,"I agree. One thing I don't like is when a director is considered an objective barometer of filmmaking quality (fans of Kubrick and Nolan in particular tend to have this problem). I'll check out another Bresson film some time, and if it's not my cup of tea, I'll move on. Thanks for replying."
TrueFilm,3amtws,montypython22,33,Mon Jun 22 15:38:40 2015 UTC,"Bresson is in my personal Pantheon of the greatest directors of all time, and I can understand how frustrating it seems to try to understand his cinema. It's a very challenging cinema, one that asks you to remove certain pre-conceived notions of what movies must do, and in a way, his is a philosophy in and of itself. But the trick, I've found, is to not treat Bresson's movies like they were the Holy Grail. He works best when you simply let the images pass by you. You don't try to ask yourself what they mean as they're passing by, but you do try to forget a part of yourself as you're watching the movie. It's best to watch his movies without ANY means of distraction. If you don't, the effect is lost, because a Bresson film is, in effect, a cinematic meditation.  Bresson and Lynch? Their styles couldn't be further apart. Bresson's worlds are pure and simply shot; Lynch's worlds are artificial and filled to the brim with constantly-subverted cliches. Bresson is a classical filmmaker; Lynch is a postmodern filmmaker.   The point of a Bresson is precisely because everything is shot so starkly, without anything in the traditional sense of visual panache. This, in itself, constitutes a breathtaking style of its own that works best when you don't expect it to dazzle you every second. His films are notoriously hard to get into, particularly because people have a set conception of Bresson as ""this auteurist master"". Then, when they get to watching a Bresson where the pace is drawn-out and the acting seems to be hollow to the max, they check out and think, ""This Bresson doesn't know how to direct.""  But this is how Bresson's worldview works. He LIKES sparsity and cleanness. He would often ask his actors to perform the same scene 60 times in a row, until all pretensions of acting and ""constructedness"" would disappear and what would be left were the words, plain and simple. It only seems ""dry"" if what you're expecting is clever subversion at every second. Every single image that Bresson presents you is of the utmost spiritual importance. There is no smarmy ""a-ha!"" moments or ironic subversiveness a la Lynch. His stories work on the parable level: they are simple stories that ask a lot of questions that grapple with the totality of human existence. The spirituality of a Bresson film has never been matched. If you're watching it and think it's too slow, you're not getting it. In Au hasard Balthazar, for instance, by making the protagonist of his best film a non-human, he makes it abundantly clear how insignificant our perspectives and our lives are in relation to the long-running channel of Everythingness we swim through every day. Our ""privileged"" sense of superiority through humanity is false; when we really reflect on it, the donkey is just as compelling and just as important as the human. He makes you EMPATHIZE and CARE about the outsider in our lives, moreso than any other director.  Here's Donald Richie on Bresson and people's reactions to him:   ""Bresson is a director that appeals to each person so individually, that everybody has his/her own personal vision of what the director has done. He calls forth emotion to the extent that you reveal yourself in strange kinds of ways. The wavelength of Bresson indicates that you have to go deeper into yourself to see him that you typically do with most directors.   The best thing to do is to not approach a Bresson with high expectations. You're sure to be disappointed. Start with A Man Escaped or Pickpocket; those are Bresson at his most thematically pure--perhaps even at his simplest. To me, his shining masterpiece is Au hasard Balthazar, a devastating tale about a girl and her donkey and the hardships they face as they grow up together. That was my first Bresson movie, and I cried tremendously, it was that emotionally affecting."
TrueFilm,3amtws,Mothravka,7,Sun Jun 21 20:17:24 2015 UTC,"He would often ask his actors to perform the same scene 60 times in a row, until all pretensions of acting and ""constructedness"" would disappear and what would be left were the words, plain and simple.       This isn't completely true. It's mostly a rumour people spread around, that he made them repeat something like that so much. In Ingela Romare's book about Bresson, there is a long interview with him where he said that it's false and just rumour about his way of working. He simply made his models utter a sentence and asked them to not think about what they were saying. He could also ask them to think about something else than the content in what they were saying."
TrueFilm,3amtws,abrightersummerday,2,Sun Jun 21 21:01:29 2015 UTC,"Interesting; I wonder if Bresson himself is quoted anywhere on the subject. In any case, both processes are toward the same end, which is apparent in his films."
TrueFilm,3amtws,abrightersummerday,5,Mon Jun 22 03:27:08 2015 UTC,"I felt a bit like OP in reaction to Bresson's films. I've only seen A Man Escaped and Pickpocket, the former on the big screen and the latter at home. From my experience,  I agree about the importance of watching Bresson without distractions. Without lapsing into pop psychology cliche,  I wonder if the sparseness of Bresson is harder for ""millennials"" to get into. I'm a digital native,  and am used to the quick fix of Reddit and YouTube, the constant buzzing in my pocket of a text message or Twitter update. Bresson doesn't give you a lot of stimulation... he seems to ask for your patience and attention. I had a very hard time staying locked into Pickpocket, with the vcr blinking,  the refrigerator humming,  dogs barking outside...  On the other hand,  I'm very used to stillness,  slowness, and contemplation in films. Hou Hsiao-Hsien is one of my favorite directors. I love Tarkovsky. I think the main difference is that these two always give you something to look at. The action is infrequent,  the pace is slow.  But when the movie asks you to contemplate,  you're contemplating over a beautiful composition,  perfect light,  a gorgeous tracking shot,  or the magnificence of something like rain or a mountain. Bresson doesn't give you that.  In fact, his films aren't slow... really. They plod along at an even pace. They are dry--i think that was the right word. The actors and cinematography don't supply the emotion, and Bresson doesn't tell you when to stop and think for a while.   These are my thoughts on just two films, of course. I've been putting off Balthasar for ages; animal cruelty is really hard for me.   Based on your description of the spiritual equivalence of the donkey and the girl, I think you'd enjoy this short story:  ""Ox"" by Shen Congwen"

He does not slap emotion onto the keys. He waits for it. It comes, and fills his fingers...   That's borrowed from Bresson's manifesto on cinematography (Link).

TrueFilm,3altsy,montypython22,24,Sun Jun 21 14:10:11 2015 UTC,"No controversial opinions this week! (For the most part…)  This has been a very long week, so bear with me here:  Cries and Whispers (Ingmar Bergman, 1973)— ★★★★½ I’ll direct the naysayers who don’t think Bergman is capable of drawing out non-art-house emotions to this little slice-of-hell. This may be Bergman at his most emotionally devastating. The zoom-movements of this film are sublime, and because their subjects are the four devastating leading-ladies (Ullmann, Thulin, Harriet Andersson, and Kari Sylwan) who give the densest performances of their lives, the striking cinematography is never wasted. I've found that his movies start unbearably slow and dreary, but God do they pay off. I’ll have to watch it again because the first twenty minutes or so, I was still trying to figure out what the hell was happening and didn’t have faces committed to names—but this isn’t a problem of the movie, per se. It’s just so damn dense, and then suddenly becomes eerily clear once the dying sister Agnes starts going into her frightening hysterics.   Inside Out (Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmen, 2015)— ★★★★★ I’ve written extended thoughts on Letterboxd, so I’ll redirect you there.. Suffice it to say that it’s replaced Up as my favorite Pixar. I can totally see something like Inside Out being put in conversation with a masterpiece like French New Wave director Agnes Varda’s subtle Le Bonheur (1965). It takes the warm-hearted, lite-psycho-probes of Pete Docter and his crew to create what is Pixar’s best film yet.  Lava (James Murphy, 2014)— ★★★★ Lay off it! It isn’t annoying or saccharine! It’s like melodrama—it’s supposed to be sentimental and contrived. Jeepers, the amount of curmudgeons who dislike this is astounding. If you don't have at least a couple of tears welling up in your eyes during the climax at the middle, get your blood checked.  Short Cuts (Robert Altman, 1993) – ★★★★★  Even more extended thoughts here.   As a native of L.A., let me say: Damn. Altman NAILS the City of Angels better than anybody else has (save, perhaps, for John Singleton in Boyz n the Hood). Short Cuts grapples with a myriad of elements and theme (fate, fidelity, murder, rape, masculinity, sadism, wrong impressions, psychosis, chain reactions, alcoholism, suicide, the show-bizzz world, racism, sexism, homophobia) without seeming like it's grappling with anything at all. Like any ""Altmasterpiece"" (McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Nashville, 3 Women, Come Back to the Five and Dime Jimmy Dean Jimmy Dean, The Player, Cookie's Fortune), if you're willing to engage with what the Big A has to say, you'll find that the film stays in your subconscious longer than you expected. A character moment, a bizarre quirk, an inconspicuous detail that you didn't think particularly relevant when watching will suddenly spring back on you when you least expect it. The same can be said with pretty much any of the 22 performers in Short Cuts. It is a masterpiece, plain and simple. It is Charactermite Art of the highest quality, to semi-paraphrase Manny Farber. It doesn't try to be an arsty-fartsy achievement, at times it seems totally unaware of the emotions that it registers. But in the end, it says a great deal about how humans interact, abuse, and love each other than any other movie I've encountered in a long time.  Days of Heaven (Terrence Malick, 1978)— ★★★★½ Is it weird that I feel hollow but dazzled at the same time? Days of Heaven inspires bizarre and oftentimes erratic emotions: loss, anger, impatience, leisurely wonder. No other person could make this story matter more than Malick. Just to fuck with you, he makes what seems to be the most incongruous element of the movie—the little girl's voiceover—the key to unlocking it, if we are to heed Papa Roger's enlightening 1997 analysis. A rewatch is imminent. I'm left cold but I like it. It's a mystery that keeps me wanting to explore it more. Yes, yes, the film is beautiful, obviously, but everyone says that. Like To the Wonder or The Tree of Life, I’m still frantically probing the film to see WHY it’s like that. A reason that goes BEYOND the simple answer of “Oh, it’s Malick evoking 1910s America!”  This is a very Old Testament story. Time to go hit the ol’ family Bible to see what relevant verses may have affected Malick in the making of this work o’ art.  L’Atalante (Jean Vigo, 1934)—★★★★★ It's amazing how deep the characterizations in the film are. Only a couple of minutes in, and I feel like I've known the idealistic Juliette, the scruffy and pernicious Jean, and the cantankerous Papa Jules (Michel Simon in an astounding supporting performance) all my life. (You, incidentally, feel the same thing in Short Cuts, but it takes 2 hours for that feeling to kick in. Vigo only has 90 minutes and pulls it off so breathlessly in so little time.) It’s a story you’ve heard MANY times—husband and wife get married, wife wants something more than the husband is able to provide, wife temporarily leaves husband, both find they’re desperate without each other, both try to find each other again. But Vigo makes this old story FRESH  and in-vigo-rating by infusing the film with a distinct feel—poetic realist griminess aboard a trash barge. The performances are natural, the film is hazy with just the right amount of grain to make you feel like you’re in a trashy bliss, and the narrative movements are both well-paced and well-set-up. Above all, it's a beautiful film, reminiscent of Murnau's Sunrise. I think Vigo goes further, however, with his more well-rounded characters and naturalistic performances that never once reek of artificiality or expressionism. Instead, it's a moving documentary about the conjugal life, shot in gorgeously hazy B-&-W by Boris Kaufman. The final shot of the film is worth the price of admission alone.  Jean Vigo's simple conjugal fable L'Atalante is a triumph of humanist imagination.  The Killing of a Chinese Bookie (re-watch) (John Cassavetes, 1976)—★★★★½ Extended thoughts here.  The Killing of a Chinese Bookie does not quite reach the blinding and furious pathos of something like A Woman Under the Influence, but it is a bold and stylistically challenging film nonetheless. Worthy of being ranked among Cassavetes's best. It goes where no neo-noir dares to go: total blackness. At times, we can't even parse out who we're watching. We can only see an intricate shadowplay that, to viewers, will either be boring and lousily shot....or impressionist and beautifully evocative.  I think we all know which camp I'm firmly in.  Fantasia—(Produced by The Diz, 1940)— ★★★★  Why the hell are the stereotyped Asian mushrooms on the Netflix poster-art of this movie?  The first half is almost perfect. My personal favorite performance, the Rite of Spring passage, despite complaints from a bunch of classical music perfectionists, is bold and unusual for a Disney whose more inclined sugarcoat rather than to reveal eye-opening complications of human existence. I’m sure young little T. Malick saw this and thought, “Ya know? I can make something better.” And it took him exactly seventy years to do so.   But the second half…? Yeesh, with the first sequence back from the Intermission, the Pastoral scene, we get a return to the Disney I despise: maudlin sentimental bosh of the worst kind. The birds are singing! The forest is bliss! The black centaurs are tending to the white centaurs! The hippo dance is kind of forgettable, until we’re jolted back into darker waters with the Night on Bald Mountain triumph.  Very uneven, sure, but not very Disney at all. I like it better than most of the other Disneys with a narrative. It’s convinced me to check out the forgotten Disney package films of the 40s (Three Caballeros, Make Mine Music, etc.), because I’m under the impression they’re more Looney Tunes-ian, which will always remain superior in my eyes."
TrueFilm,3altsy,montypython22,5,Sun Jun 21 16:24:47 2015 UTC,"The Last Waltz (Marty Scorsese, ’78)— ★★★  Extended thoughts here.  Don’t get me wrong. I love the music. I grew up on it. It’s the film and the quality of these performances I object to. The only two people in top form, it seems, are Joni Mitchell (of course) and Muddy Waters. The rest are just old dinosaurs sadly trying to eke out a good non-coke-addled performance for a bunch of drop-out losers on a winter evening in the mid-70s.   The only reason this is noteworthy, cinematically, is because Martin Scorsese is in the director's chair; and even then, he was at the worst stage of his illustrious career—frazzled on coke the entire time—so you can't really call this Marty at peak form. Otherwise, it's very routine. The backstage stuff is uninteresting; we don't learn anything penetrating about The Band, just the same old quirky backstage stories that could be featured in one of those children’s pop-up books, “WHO WERE THE BAND???” The concert is shot rather blandly; the same zooms, the same strict attention to what's happening onstage rather than in the stadium. Demme's 1984 Talking Heads-rockumentary Stop Making Sense would go on to do the ""Only-Focus-on-Musicians"" schtick ten times better. In that movie, the focus is ALWAYS on whatever the hell David Byrne is doing on stage. You WANT to stay on stage with him. In this movie, however, you’re curious to see how these people are reacting to the same ol’ songs performed rather uncreatively and only important because it’s a historical document of The   Band’s “Farewell” concert. (Remember, ladies and gents, this was before reunion tours were a thing, so people actually believed this was the last time they’d get together!*)  Despite the impressive selection of 70s singer-songwriter greats, I wouldn't consider this among the best rockumentaries (Woodstock, Monterey Pop, Stop Making Sense, Dont Look Now, Gimme Shelter). I'd put it a hair above the Bogdanovich doc about Tom Petty (who I've never really cared for) but a hair below Let It Be (which shares The Last Waltz's predilection with bummed-out rock dinosaurs; except the Beatles on a bad day is still leagues above anybody else on a good day). Consider this the cinematic equivalent of Bob Dylan's Hard Rain album (aka, the album that was released at the tail-end of the Rolling Thunder Revue...once all the magic had gone).  Raiders of the Lost Ark (Steven Spielberg, 1981)— ★★★½    The poor kiddies who must have seen this in the theatres...what's the lesson, Nazis have no soul and therefore you shouldn't cry when their faces are literally melded off before your very eyes? No?  Ah, there I go again. Trying to find a point and a moral in a story that is purposely made to function merely as a series of increasingly exciting setpieces, as hollow as possible, all bravura and no oomph. This isn't a knock against Raiders; it's its shining'n'defining feature. The woman is your classic Damsel-in-Distress who can't think a rational thought, the stock villains are as simply evil as they come (the only other appropriate substitute would have been a crew of Juggalos), and the main character is a white adventurer hell-bent on subjugating the jungle and his niche in history, Aguirre-style.  A sometimes-glorious revisionist historical fantasy from Steven Spielberg, who's made better movies with more soul, honesty, and more careful attention to race (Close Encounters, The Color Purple, the first 2/3rds of Saving Private Ryan), but whose skill at direction never falters here.  One Two Three (Billy Wilder, 1961)— ★★★½  I love me some Billy, but man was the second half…kind of a letdown.  The first half plays out like Wilder on jumpy hashish. It's an outrageous comedy, filled with appropriately boisterous performances by James Cagney and What's My Line panelist Arlene Francis as a American emigre-couple in West Berlin. Cagney works for Coca-Cola and tries to wrest control of the East Berlin/Soviet market from the Russians, so that the Commies get a taste of the wonders of Coke Classic. However, his boss's daughter shotgun-marries a revolutionary from East Berlin, and Cagney has only 24 hours to explain the situation to his Coke boss before he makes a surprise visit to Cagney's corporate office in West Berlin. Go-go-fire-dancing to ""The Sabre Dance"" and car-chases zig-zagging across the gridzoned Berlin are the cherries on top of this crazy sundae.  But the second half is just the same-ol’ jokes that were made in the first half…done at a much less schizophrenic pace. I didn't laugh much--odd for a Wilder movie. Even the end-punchline seems rather contrived and one-note. The female characters do not reach the blinding pathos of Fran Kubelik his previous masterpiece The Apartment. In fact, the misogynism becomes rather striking after a while; Wilder depends on it way too much.  It's definitely worth the price of admission, though; to paraphrase Ernest Hemingway on Huck Finn, the movie ends where Cagney and his buxom secretary help the Revolutionary escape. The rest is just cheating.  Vernon, Florida—Errol Morris, 1981—★★★½  Yep, the people of Vernon, Florida are quite kooky, Morris. What's your point?  Love & Mercy (Bill Pohlad, 2015)— ★★★½  Look, I know there were plot contrivances in this Brian Wilson movie. Do I care? Hell no. If it makes people listen to the records and think about the Big W more, so be it! THAT’S this movie’s purpose and sole-defining-goal-in-life. If we must have by-the-note biopics that don’t try to twist the truth a la The Social Network and say something about our society (which, by the way, are the BEST biopics), then by God let those biopics be Love & Mercy. Paul Dano and John Cusack’s performances are golden, though. I’m more surprised at Cusack, who judging by the trailers, I felt I would have had a tough time convincing myself that the fella from Say Anything and The Grifters was doing Brian Wilson.  Of course, the music is the best America has to offer, so no faults there.  The Nutty Professor (Tom Shadyac, 1996)—★★ Well, sure, it obviously doesn’t hold a candle to the Jerry Lewis version, but I laughed at some points.  Movie of the Week: 1.) Short Cuts 2.) L'Atalante 3.) Inside Out 4.) The Killing of a Chinese Bookie 5.) Cries and Whispers"
TrueFilm,3altsy,afewthoughtsonfilm,3,Sun Jun 21 16:35:24 2015 UTC,"Yup, the people of Vernon, Florida are quite kooky, Morris.  What's your point?   Much like with his debut film, Gates of Heaven, Vernon, Florida feels like a tribute to the stories and lives of people that normally wouldn't be given any attention in cinema.  What I admire about Morris's early work is how little he judges the subjects, despite how silly they can seem (especially the turkey hunter in this one).  Morris gives them a platform to discuss their dreams, their aspirations, their fears, and their beliefs.  For me, stuff like Vernon, Florida is a breath of fresh air, a departure from what we normally see on screen.  Rarely do we allow for the weirder, more ""out there"" members of society to be given the spotlight without prejudice or judgement.  Ultimately, that's what makes Vernon, Florida (and seemingly the works of Les Blank, at least up to this point in my viewing of his career) so important and meaningful."
TrueFilm,3altsy,montypython22,2,Sun Jun 21 18:35:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that. I guess I was just reacting to the fact that I seem to get the point of the movie about 10 minutes in. ""Well, we're going to be exploring eccentrics, aren't we?"" I asked myself. And lo and behold, we were! Now I haven't seen Gates of Heaven, which is on my list of shame, so I can't compare. However, I can say that Vernon was thoroughly enjoyable. It was just that, about halfway through, I got a tad bored since I understood the existence of this movie. Still, it's fun to know that the cure for diarrhea is apparently the sound of a turkey-double-gobble."

Both are really quirky films though and are especially interesting when juxtaposed with the kinds of things Morris makes now, which are good but in a very different way."
TrueFilm,3altsy,BlunderLikeARicochet,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:06:16 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: Morris was originally in Vernon to make a film about Vernon's nickname: ""Nub City"", so called because the town was full of voluntary amputees -- dozens of people who dismembered themselves for insurance money. After a few too many death threats, he reworked the footage of non-amputee kooks into Vernon, Florida.  This Tampa Bay Times article is highly recommended:  http://www.sptimes.com/2007/09/02/Life/Dismembered_again.shtml   ""It was hard to make a jury believe a man would shoot off his foot.""  Not that the insurance companies didn't try. According to Ken Dornstein in his book Accidentally, on Purpose: The Making of a Personal Injury Underworld in America, they hired John J. Healy, the above-mentioned investigator, to look into the accidents. He observed that Vernon's second-largest occupation seemed to be watching hound dogs mating in the town square, and that its largest was self-mutilation for monetary gain.  ""To sit in your car on a sweltering summer evening on the main street of Nub City,"" he wrote, ""watching anywhere from eight to a dozen cripples walking along the street, gives the place a ghoulish, eerie atmosphere."""

TrueFilm,3altsy,MUSTKILLNOOBS,2,Sun Jun 21 18:31:31 2015 UTC,"L'Atalante, while a sharp film in its technical aspects, has a great understanding of humanism that raises it to a zenith, alone with Malick's bests. Both capture the turmoil of daily struggle, never giving shame to anyone who screws up. Of course, repercussions still exist but we feel the victim's pain, it is just as tragic to us as it is to the character. There is no glorification of torment, it just happens.  What I am trying to say is that both L’Atalante and Malick films are more about how characters live through the narrative as opposed to being about the narrative itself. They both consist of great stories but what they focus on is how people bear through them.  That is a major  reason why I find those films to be great."
TrueFilm,3altsy,montypython22,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:34:20 2015 UTC,"Right, and though I adore Malick's films, I always forget to forget the narrative. I seem to have been trying to hard to find a plot in Days of Heaven, fool that I am, because I figured his pre-New World stuff would have some plots. But nope!

TrueFilm,3altsy,lordhadri,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:36:41 2015 UTC,"Days of Heaven is just a very lonely movie, because Malick is a lonely person, or at least isn't afraid to express that about himself through cinema.

TrueFilm,3altsy,viborg,12,Mon Jun 22 07:42:50 2015 UTC,"The Raid: Redemption I had heard a lot about how this film eschewed tired conventions and just unleashed an onslaught of awesome action, and they were right. holy hell, the fight scenes in this were so visceral and brutal, and they just kept escalating throughout the film. i did like that it took the cop/dealer dichotomy and played around just enough with the morality of it to keep it interesting. the design of the building was great as well, really allowed for the verticality of the plot to translate into something that added to the film instead of just constraining it. 4/5  Man with a Movie Camera not a whole lot i can say about this that hasn't been said, i couldn't believe the editing. it was incredible, and to see how soviets lived first-hand is something i think is really crucial in diffusing the propaganda that's been taught to us americans in our education system. 5/5  Werckmeister Harmonies I didn't go into this expecting it to be a top 5 film for me of all time, but bela tarr makes films that just cut me to my core. he takes all these expansive ideas and makes them literal manifest in the enactment of the sun's orbit and the whale. so many moments of this will stay with me for a long time. i found that the long takes only augmented this sense of existential self-giving, unlike say the tribe or birdman, where it just felt like affectation to me. i can't wait to work through the rest of his filmography 5/5  Shrek Forever After i make poor decisions. 2/5  The King of Comedy this is fucked up, even for scorsese. really feels like a precursor to nightcrawler with the emphasis on media obsession and a ruthlessly ambitious protagonist, but the way scorsese and de niro play it off as dark comedy makes it even more haunting. scorsese has said that he doesn't differentiate between his fantasy and reality, which for me is a great strength of his. it makes for a tough first viewing at times, but i'm sure like with taxi driver, re-watching this would greatly add to the experience. 4 1/2/5  Aguirre: The Wrath of God this was my first real exposure to Herzog, and i have to say i'm in love. he makes his apocalypse feel earned, by taking the ambitions and religions of each of the expedition members and pitting them against each other in the expanse. even though they were trapped in the large wilderness they did not know, there is a claustrophobia, their fate bends down on them with such efficacy that when it does arrive it surprises you with the surreal imagery of the end. probably top 10 for me 5/5"
TrueFilm,3altsy,Jibby_von_HaHa,2,Sun Jun 21 17:16:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting take on Man With A Movie Camera here, from ambient/downtempo musician Biosphere (in the same ballpark as Aphex Twin):   In 1996 Norwegian composer Geir Jenssen (""aka Biosphere"") was commissioned by the Tromsø International Film Festival to write a new soundtrack for the movie, using the director's written instructions for the original accompanying piano player.    I've always loved that song with the Twin Peaks sample but in context it seems a little out of place. Overall very well done though."
TrueFilm,3altsy,AlexSitaras,2,Mon Jun 22 00:48:22 2015 UTC,"I would recommend now you watch The Raid 2: Berendal (which you probably are already planning on doing). It really upped the action and story, and even if you aren't to big a fan of the story you can appreciate the best, most brutal fight choreography in any movie.  I would also recommend Fitzcarraldo, Herzog's next project he did with Kinski after Agguire.  Too me it tops it.  And the documentary on the making of it, Burden of Dreams, is also excellent."
TrueFilm,3altsy,isarge123,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:44:38 2015 UTC,"I think Aguirre might be Herzog's most beautiful film although I would recommend seeing Heart of Glass. It uses very dark imagery and is gloomy. If you hadn't heard, that is the film where he hypnotized the supporting cast while shooting. It is slow paced, exploring obsession as any other Herzog film does. The ending is a vignette of sorts that doesn't even relate to the main plot, but is beautiful in its imagery and narration.  If you're interested in his documentaries, Into the Abyss is a cold, lack-of-authorial-presence (non-characteristic of Herzog) documentary relating to the death penalty. Two individuals commit a crime- one faces live in prison while the other is executed."
TrueFilm,3altsy,isarge123,30,Sun Jun 21 18:17:41 2015 UTC,"I really had a fantastic week, probably the best this year.   Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) - Dir. George Miller My second viewing and it remains a lovely film. George Miller has put most recent action movies to shame. The already dull action of Avengers 2 looks like Battlefield Earth in comparison to the high-energy, downright insane action displayed here. The visuals are stunning and do a great job of building a larger world only hinted at in the sparse dialogue. 9.5/10    Macbeth (1971) - Dir. Roman Polanski One of Polanski's weaker efforts. It's a competently directed movie with solid visuals, but it just feels dull. The casting is problematic, with the actors appearing somewhat deadpan delivering what should be emotional dialogue. Whether this is part of Polanski's vision I cannot be certain, but nonetheless it doesn't work. As I said though, it's a visually engaging film and the shockingly brutal finale is executed very well. I also admired Polanski's bleaker, ambiguous ending, which I actually prefer over Shakespeare's. 6/10    The Social Network (2010) - Dir. David Fincher I haven't seen all of David Fincher's filmography, but I doubt that his other works will top this, his masterpiece. While the technical side of the film (Fincher's stylistic direction, the cinematography, editing and score) is great, the film's success is largely due to Aaron Sorkin's intricate and intimate screenplay. Similar to his popular TV show The West Wing, the dialogue flows thick and fast and the cast do a stellar job of conveying every nuance and emotional beat, of which there are many. Andrew Garfield, who's performances I found to be uneven in the Amazing Spider-Man films, portrays Eduardo Saverin fantastically under Fincher. Jesse Eisenberg is great as Mark Zuckerberg, managing to maintain the audience's sympathies even when the film chooses to portray him as a morally misguided figure. 10/10    The Adjustment Bureau (2011) - Dir. George Nolfi One of my family members loves this film, so I've watched it many times, and it's a very solid romantic-sci-fi-thriller that manages to present some pretty bold ideas with ease. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt provide great chemistry, John Toll's cinematography is gorgeous, the dialogue is witty (though sometimes a bit on-the-nose) and it's thought-provoking handling of themes such as free-will and fate are delicately executed. 8/10    Pan's Labyrinth (2006) - Dir. Guillermo Del Toro What an interesting film. Guillermo Del Toro is certainly a visual genius, as expressed in his beautiful yet brutal depiction of a young girl in 1944 Fascist Spain who discovers an enchanting but deadly world of fairies, fauns, giant toads and a horrifying, child-eating Pale Man. The production design and combination of digital and practically effects are stunning to look at, as is the Oscar-winning cinematography. The performances are very strong, particularly notable are Ivana Baquero's outstanding child performance and Sergi López as the villain. 9/10"
TrueFilm,3altsy,Scholles,20,Sun Jun 21 15:31:24 2015 UTC,"Inside Out (2015) - Dir. Pete Docter Inside Out is terrifically unique, soulful and well-crafted, and is PIXAR's best since Toy Story 3, and maybe better. There have been fears amongst many that PIXAR was experiencing a decline in quality, especially with the awful Cars 2 and the rather average  Brave and Monster's University. This film puts them to rest, and shows that PIXAR still has more than a few tricks up their sleeve. The voice work is excellent, the comedy is not excessive but generally hilarious and it boasts a stunning honesty and realism rarely found in mainstream animation. It's truly an emotional journey (literally) and offers such an engaging and truly beautiful insight into the way we (humans) think. As is expected from PIXAR, the film is visually stunning, with top-notch animation and inventive production design. I was so marvellously surprised by Inside Out, I urge everyone to go see it. It's the best film I've seen so far from this year. 10/10    JFK (1991) - Dir. Oliver Stone This was one of the movies that had been on watch list for some time that I finally got around to. I watched the directors cut, so that's the one I'll be talking about. I'm not aware of the differences, but if any of you have seen both versions I'd be intrigued to know which one you prefer. JFK is considered one of the most controversial films of all time, due to its nonchalant blending of facts and speculation. I don't watch films for a history lesson, so it didn't bother me that the film isn't entirely historically accurate. Oliver Stone once said ""I feel that movies are not reality, but an approximation of reality, and in some cases, a wished fulfilment."" This is evident in JFK, a film one which Stone, through the character of Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), presents his opinion on how and why JFK was assassinated in Dallas in 1963. As I said, I'm not judging it as a history lesson, but as a film... which means it's bloody brilliant. In its 205 minute running time the movie presents a huge amount of information: truths, lies, characters, subplots and evidence, yet it maintains a clear coherency for its entire duration. Kevin Costner gives one of his greatest performances as Garrison, and likewise the immense supporting cast (which includes Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Gary Oldman, Sissy Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones and many more) is in top form. The cinematography is involving and striking and the highly acclaimed editing is some of the best I've seen. It's a long ride but it's very well worth it. 10/10    The Incredibles (2005) - Dir. Brad Bird In my opinion the greatest superhero film ever made, and possibly PIXAR's best. What struck me on this viewing was how damn dark it is. Pixar had already shown that they weren't afraid to take risks, but the maturity and emotional complexity of The Incredibles still blew me away. It's funny for sure, with a witty screenplay and great visual gags, but it never detracts from the intensity. It's also a biting deconstruction of many superhero genre cliches and formulas. For those who haven't had the supreme pleasure of seeing it, it's highly recommended. 10/10"

TrueFilm,3altsy,montypython22,19,Mon Jun 22 05:52:26 2015 UTC,"rewatch - The Wind Rises directed by Hayao Miyazaki (2013) ★★★★  Miyazaki’s swan song is very different from anything else in his career. It’s a biography of the man who designed the planes that Kamikaze pilots flew in world war 2. It details all the saddest moments in Japan pre-war. An earthquake and fire that levels Tokyo, the tuberculosis epidemic. In other words, this is a very very sad movie. One of the saddest that Studio Ghibli ever put out. But also one of the most beautiful and observant. It documents life in all its magic and despair. The beautiful times mixed in with the horrible. It shows us that atrocities and tragedies are always happening, but we must always keep going to reach the moments worth living. I loved this even more this time than my first watch, definitely climbed the ranks of my favorite Ghibli movies.   The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness directed by Mami Sunada (2014) ★★★  After The Wind Rises it was interesting to see what was kind of a “making of” documentary. Not really entirely a making of, as it’s more of a biographical doc on Miyazaki that happened to be filming during the making of The Wind Rises. Even though I can’t say I really loved the documentary as a whole, I love Miyazaki so much that it made it really engrossing. I’m not sure the documentary would have drawn me in as much if it was the same film about a different anime director. I just found it interesting to watch a great artist like him work on a great film, to see his process, from writing (who else really wants a book of all of Miyazaki’s storyboards/scripts? That would be amazing) to voice overs. I also love the atmosphere of Studio Ghibli, the fact that they have an office cat that just hangs around all the time tells you the type of place it is. Just as strange and magical as their films. This was a meh documentary, but I really liked it due to the subject matter and the insights into the work of the greatest animation studio around.  The Last Waltz directed by Martin Scorsese (1978) ★★★★  I never thought a concert movie could be so cinematic. Martin Scorsese doesn’t just document the concert, he turns it into something more. It’s not just a bunch of songs that have been filmed, it has a unique directorial style to it, it’s an auteur piece even though it is really just The Band playing their final concert. Scorsese really brings something new to the table. The Last Waltz probably has the best lineup of musicians in one concert that I have ever seen. What other concert movies should I watch? What else is essential viewing? (I own Stop Making Sense and plan on watching it soon).  To the Wonder directed by Terrence Malick (2013) ★★★  Slightly less accessible than The Tree of Life, and definitely nowhere near as good, but still a deep and beautiful film in its own way. To the Wonder is the story of an American man who meets a woman in France, and moves back to Oklahoma with her and her daughter. Her daughter becomes unhappy, her visa expires, they leave, the French woman comes back without her daughter, the relationship falls apart. That’s pretty much all it is. It’s a simple plot, with some added parts about one of the man’s past relationships, as well as the character of a priest. But like most Malick movies, To the Wonder doesn’t focus on that, the plot becomes a secondary detail. He’s a visual and thematic artist. In place of long scenes of dialogue, we get beautifully shot montages with whispered narration. Emmanuel Lubezki’s photography is once again magnificent. He’s by far my favorite working cinematographer right now. I didn’t love To the Wonder as much as I loved The Tree of Life, but it was good in its own way.  Headhunters directed by Morten Tyldum (2012) ★★★★  Holy shit Headhunters got my heart pounding more than most movies ever manage to. Headhunters is about a corporate head hunter, who is hired by all the biggest Norwegian companies to find new employees. On the side he steals valuable paintings in order to pay for the luxurious lifestyle he wants to live. He meets a man who owns a painting worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he then steals this painting and the man comes after him. Jesus Christ this movie made me tense. Although the survival of the protagonist does feel unrealistic as he’s way more resourceful than anyone without years of training should be, it’s a fun journey that demands us to suspend our disbelief. Lots of dark humor, tons of violence, Jaime Lannister as a terrifying villain, and twists and turns out the wazoo. This is a risky and entertaining action thriller. I hope that Morten Tyldum does more of this in the future, taking risks instead of putting out stuff like The Imitation Game.  Shame directed by Steve McQueen (2011) ★★★1/2  Michael Fassbender is magnificent in this and further proves himself to be one of the best actors working today. His performance is fearless, shameless, without inhibitions. He gets in front of the camera and makes magic in a role that few actors would have the guts to pull off. Just like Requiem for a Dream this is a very dark movie about the dangers of addiction. It shows us what happens when someone gives up their ordinary life to become a slave to their cravings. Brandon is unable to live a normal life, and when his sister comes to disrupt his routine, he can’t deal with it and goes even deeper into his addiction, stooping to new lows and demeaning himself even further. One complaint though, I keep reading reviews praising Carey Mulligan, and is it just me, or could she not keep her accent going? It was a little laughable at times. Fassbender is the king of accents right now, but Mulligan can not get the hang of an American accent."

I think you'll find it the same way once you start investigating the rockumentary genre more in depth. Suffice it to say that Woodstock and Monterey Pop are the Kings. It's something about the festival atmosphere, the psychedelic and hyperkinetic performances, and the joyous Lester-like feel of the cameras that come together to create a truly mesmorizing film--let alone concert film. Criterion has an amazing Monterey Pop boxset worth investing in, mainly due to the abundance of special features including a whole 2 hours of Pennebaker-director director's-cuts that didn't make the final product and two supplementary short films--featuring the entire performances of Otis Redding and Jimi Hendrix, the festival's two best acts--that will keep you entertained for hours. Woodstock, however, is the more daring of the two, not the least of which is due to its triple-split-screens and mixture of concert film and social documentary aspects. That's a rockumentary that sets itself out to be much more than the music, and it is.  Stop Making Sense does what Last Waltz tried to do, only with more energetic performers on stage and a much-more-clearly-distinct line between the stage and the off/back-stage. I definitely enjoy that a lot.  Gimme Shelter is not a rockumentary so much as an exploration of the burned-out 60s feel that gave way to 70s negative ennui. It ironically features the Rolling Stones at their best--during the 1969 American tour. However, the whole tone of the movie is bleak, since the final segment of the movie is the Stones's disastrous performance at Altmont in '69. It's directed by the Maysles Brothers, so it's certifiably great.  Other concert films that are personal favorites of mine include:   The Concert for Bangladesh, featuring George Harrison, Ravi Shankar, Bob Dylan, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, and friends Dont Look Back, directed by Pennebaker about Bob Dylan's 1966 tour The TAMI Show The Song Remains the Same, about Led Zeppelin. The fantasy sequences are tripe, the concert itself is fun."

TrueFilm,3altsy,rockwood15,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:12:10 2015 UTC,"Haha, I love all genres (except heavy metal...)! But I haven't come across a neo-soul/R&B concert film I've been amazed by. The European Stax Revue Tour of '67 comes close. But even in that case, it's mainly because of the performers, not what's happening cinematically.  For some reason, the best rockumentaries come out for...well, for rock. There's that Ken Burns jazz documentary, of which I highly recommend, but that does a piss-poor job covering jazz in the post-Miles Davis era. You may say that jazz in the Armstrong/Ellington age is the best, I will say that's no excuse for forgetting about Sun Ra, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, most of Ornette Coleman's greatest works, Stan Getz, Vince Guaraldi, etc."

TrueFilm,3altsy,sg587565,8,Mon Jun 22 19:27:15 2015 UTC,"Wolf Children directed by Mamoru Hosada (2013) ★★  Wolf Children is beautifully animated, but a little too cheesy for me. From the narration to the score, this movie was tailor made for people who are fans of the more sappy anime TV shows. That’s not a bad thing necessarily, it’s just not my kind of thing, I can see this being a masterpiece in the eyes of people who love that kind of thing. It does sappy very well, and again, it looks very beautiful. Still, it’s just not my kind of movie.  Barbara directed by Christian Petzold (2012) ★★★  Barbara is a very tense, yet sweet medical drama set in East Germany. Barbara, played by Nina Hoss, is a doctor who is being punished by the government for trying to emigrate to West Germany, and has been sent out to a country hospital to work under watchful eyes. The story shows us her formulating an escape plan, and bonding with the doctors who are meant to spy on her. Nina Hoss is amazing as the doctor who is desperately searching for a way out. She’s one actress that I would love to be seeing more of. I did have a few problems with the movie, it did feel a little drawn out sometimes, and some plot elements came out of nowhere and then disappeared, like the implication that the man who was helping her escape saw Barbara as nothing more than a whore. Very good movie though, it’s tense while being subtle.  Undefeated directed by T.J. Martin & Daniel Lindsay (2011) ★★★1/2  I could really not care less about football. I don’t understand it, I don’t get the rules, I don’t get why people who care about it just as much as I do get so pumped up about the super bowl every year. But more than that, the thing about football I understand the least is, why do Americans love high school football so much? Undefeated never answers that question, but it does one amazing thing. It made me care about football. And much more impressive than that, it made me care about high school football. I’ve said it here before, the mark of a really good documentary to me is the ability to not just cater to the people who already know about the subject matter, but to also be able to make others interested. Undefeated had me very interested. I think that’s because the moments on the field were all transition points to the more intimate interactions between the team. Instead of the games coming first, this movie was about the people. I really liked that aspect of it. I wasn’t rooting for their team to win, I was rooting for the individual people. It’s a very strong documentary, and one that I would highly recommend.  I Love You Phillip Morris directed by John Requa & Glenn Ficarra (2010) ★★★★  I just love it when a movie has to start off with a quote like “This really happened” and then follow it up with a second quote saying “No really, this actually happened.” This is one of the best ways of letting the audience know that they’re in for a ride. I Love You Phillip Morris is certainly a ride. It’s a con man movie, that is three parts Catch Me if You Can, two parts Wolf of Wall Street and one part Brokeback Mountain. If that sounds insane, it’s because it is. I kept thinking back to the first shots, and thinking, “did this really actually literally happen? No way.” But it did. It really actually literally did happen. Our protagonist, played by Jim Carrey (in one of his best recent performances), is one of the most slippery, evil geniuses ever portrayed on film, that also manages to be a complete idiot for love. I don’t want to spoil anything, because you should all go watch it, but after escaping prison so many times and having enough of a head start to flee the country, he always manages to get caught when he goes to visit the man he loves. Really funny, well done movie.  Inside Out directed by Pete Docter (2015) ★★★★  It pretty much lives up to the hype. The first half hour is good, not great, but the finale is probably the best Pixar third act that there is. It had me bawling multiple times, and every single one of those times was deserved. The thing I think I love most about this movie is the tiny moments, the little details, like “Forget it Jake, it’s cloud town.” To the time in the abstract thought place where they started making obscure references to Jacques Derrida, Picasso and the surrealist movement. I think I was the only one laughing when they said “It’s stage two, we’re deconstructing!” but it’s the little moments like those that make this movie special. Also, the score. That music! Oh my god, can we just give Michael Giacchino his second Oscar right now? I can’t picture anything else coming out and trumping that score this year. It’s beautiful and perfect for this movie. I definitely want to see this again soon, and I may end up taking another trip to the theater for it.  The Quiet Duel directed by Akira Kurosawa (1949) ★★★  Thank you whoever it was that linked to this movie on YouTube in that “Where do you find classic movies?” thread! I was searching for this movie for a year and then gave up because it wasn’t online anywhere. So as soon as I saw a link to it, I knew I had to watch it right away. I really liked The Quiet Duel, it’s definitely one of Kurosawa’s best pre-Rashomon films. The entire conflict could have been avoided if the doctor just used latex gloves during surgery, like he was supposed to. Basically, this movie could also be called “Why you should wear medical gloves when you’re elbow deep in another man.” That sounds weird. It shouldn’t be called that. But something else like it. This is definitely a film that’s worth watching, and I’m glad I finally found it.  Film of the Week - The Wind Rises"

TrueFilm,3altsy,PieBlaCon,8,Mon Jun 22 18:11:38 2015 UTC,"Citizen Kane (1941) already had too high expectations from this movie since its popularly considered to be the greatest of all time and my expectations were met. It honestly is an amazing movie deserving of its fame and has aged really well. Awesome story and really well acted, a must watch.   The Mission (1999) I really enjoy johnnie to's style of filming. This one was as good as exiled (though its not as bloody) which is my favourite To movie. Filled with stylish and smart shootouts and as with other To movies, some cheesiness and humour. The story, which was quite simple was executed really well and the chemistry between the main 5 characters was awesome to watch. It sucks that To is not that famous considering how consistent the quality of his movies are.   Stalker (1979) First tarkovsky movie i saw and the best movie i saw this week it's actually not really that slow paced as most people say tarkovsky's movies are so i think its a great place to start of with. Parts of the movie were really thrilling and intense. The atmosphere of the movie was really engaging, more so once the characters enter the zone. The movie does warrant multiple viewings and reading about it and i did not really understand a lot of things in it. Still its an amazing movie that should not be missed."
TrueFilm,3altsy,afewthoughtsonfilm,9,Sun Jun 21 15:00:08 2015 UTC,"CHAPPiE - I guess it's time to begin looking at District 9 as a fluke in Blomkamp's filmography, because I can't reconcile how someone could make such an incredible sci-fi film like D9 and then bring a mess like CHAPPiE into existence. The gangsters, specifically the woman, are incredibly annoying, both as characters and as actors. Poor performances both. The story is even more heavy-handed than Elysium, if you can believe it. I wanted to turn the movie off when ""Mommy"" read Chappie a book about being a black sheep. The pacing of what Chappie learns is also all over the place. There is no rhyme or reason as to how/when he learns things other than that's what the plot demands to set up the next scene. Throw in some laughable PS4 product placement and an embarrassingly simple villain by Hugh Jackman and you have CHAPPiE. The fact that this movie ends in a manner that suggests more is on the way is almost sad. Blomkamp excels at creating a believable/gritty sci-fi world, but he can't write a plot or characters to match. I used to think I wanted a sequel to District 9, but at this point, it'd certainly be a massive letdown (I've also grown to appreciate that we don't need an ""ending"" as the film's ending is quite remarkable on its own). 2/5"
TrueFilm,3altsy,montypython22,8,Sun Jun 21 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"I am on letterboxd, for those who are interested  Unfortunately, I didn't watch as much as I would have liked this week.  That being said, it was a good week to check some big films off of my watchlist.  I'll be gone the next two weeks for the Il Cinema Ritrovato festival in Bologna, Italy, so if anyone else will be there, let me know!   What I Watched This Week (in no particular order)    Our Hospitality (1923) dir. Buster Keaton & John G. Blystone - After digging through Tati's entire filmography, I figured it would only be appropriate to watch some things by the man who greatly inspired him, Buster Keaton.  I've been in love with Keaton every since the first time I saw Sherlock, Jr., and while I haven't found a film that quite matches the pure perfectness of that film, I've still found many of his works to be absolutely excellent.  Though Chaplin may have been the better artist, Keaton was certainly the better performer and cinematic mind, in my eyes.  Our Hospitality is certainly a showcase of that, giving Keaton room to orchestrate both larger and smaller gags.  The piece follows two families that have long been engaged in a violent feud and the hilarity that ensues when the daughter of one of the families unknowingly invites the son of the other over for dinner.  Much as her father wants to shoot him dead right there, he can't so long as the son is on his property as it would infringe upon his hospitality.  It's a hysterical premise, arguably one of Keaton's best, and he milks the concept for all its worth.  The majority of the film is spent within the house, bookended by an opening featuring an extended train sequence that most certainly foreshadows The General and an exciting ending sequence that best utilizes Keaton's ability as a stuntman and physical actor.  It's one of Keaton's many great works. Lost Highway (1997) dir. David Lynch - Rammstein and David Lynch go together like chocolate and peanut butter.  To use the parlance of our time, this is probably the most metal film Lynch will ever make.  The opening work of his LA trilogy, Lost Highway is a film I'm surprised few people seem to talk about.   It's one of Lynch's more fascinating and complex works, dealing with some really depressing stuff under the surface.  When describing Wild at Hear, I often have said how it feels like a film Lynch wrote when in love.  On the flip side of the coin, Lost Highway is a film about a Lynch scorned, equating the seductive nature of Patricia Arquette's character(s) to that of a black widow.  More than anything else, I got the impression that this film is mostly about Lynch reconciling his past failures and recognizing how despite his best efforts, he constantly falls back into the same mistakes (which certainly makes sense for a man whose been married four times now and has been engaged five times).  I don't want to spoil much here, but the twists and turns this film takes are riveting and bizarre.  Lynch often makes somewhat puzzling works, but this is one of the few in which the puzzle is actually very complex, more so than I think it's given credit for.  It's also Lynch's creepiest (though certainly not his scariest - that award still goes to the nightmare-inducing Inland Empire).  I adored this film far more than I expected to, and it's currently my second favorite in this trilogy and my third favorite of his films. Mulholland Drive (2001) dir. David Lynch - So here's the thing.  Lynch's two most acclaimed films are Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive.  In fairness, both are absolutely fine films and I like them quite a bit, yet neither are as complex as some of Lynch's other works.  Mulholland Drive is thankfully not as obvious as Blue Velvet, which is a film that shows its hand in the first five minutes and doesn't really add much to it for the remaining 115 minutes; however, that said, it also didn't leave me in awe, as some of Lynch's other works (including the other two in the LA trilogy) have.  The 90 minutes or so were part of the TV pilot Lynch was working on of the same name and it's really quite good, exploring the underbelly of Hollywood and the studio system.  I especially enjoyed the subplot focusing on Justin Theroux's character, a director who begins to recognize that there are powers working behind the scenes to control the industry (this feels like the most meaningful part of the film, most likely because I'm sure it is semi-autobiographical).  However, nothing about these ideas feel particularly new or insightful; rather they are fairly common beliefs about Hollywood with an added Lynchian twist.  After a sequence in a club that is so very inspired by the ending of Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain, the film dissolves into a madness that only Lynch could make.  It becomes a flurry of reversals and confusion, all of which I'd be curious to read into subtextually to try to make more sense of it.  I'll add that I'm not too sure how to feel about spoiler, although it did give me another thing to be angry at Iñárritu for stealing in Birdman.  All in all, while I did like Mulholland Drive quite a bit, I will say I don't think it's quite the same achievement as films like Eraserhead, Inland Empire, and even Lost Highway.  It's still a great film and worthy of the acclaim it has received, but I will say that it seems like the most praised of Lynch's films are the ones that are more obvious. Daises (1966) dir. Vera Chytilová - Daises was by and large the best film I watched this week.  Films are rarely as fun as this one is.  As a work of Dadaist and anarchist film, Daises is a huge achievement, a film that perpetually bucks the system at every turn.  It follows two girls who, after realizing that the world is being ruined by the powers that be, decide that they are going to forgo all social norms and just cause chaos, too.  It's a great premise and one that never disappoints during the entire 76 minute runtime.  Daises is a work that is brazenly and deliberately abstract and while I'm sure it may bother some, it's something I admire quite a bit about it.  It takes a hefty amount of audacity to make something as knowingly out-there, but when considering the subtext of the work, it's an excellent choice.  As a work of Dadaist cinema and feminist cinema, this is some high-caliber stuff that has quickly entered the pantheon of my favorite films. The Blues Accordin' to Lightnin' Hopkins (1968) dir. Les Blank - I couldn't tell you what droe me to pick up the Les Blank boxset from Criterion last week.  I have had no previous experience with his work and didn't have any good reason to blind buy it.  Yet something from within told me I should and boy was that fortunate.  Having only seen this one work by Blank, I can already tell how much I am going to adore his work.  Blank takes a very humanistic approach to documentary, spending hardly any time interviewing his subject but instead allowing for what happens on screen to speak for itself.  This is as much a film about Lightnin' Hopkins as it is about his community, showing what their existence truly is without judgement or manipulation.  It feels like an extension of Free Cinema and it's wonderful.  I can't wait to dive in deeper.   I also watched Selma (2014, dir. Ava DuVernay), Stop Making Sense (1984, dir. Jonathan Demme), Cabin Fever (2001, dir. Eli Roth), A Report on the Party and Guests (1966, dir. Jan Nemec), and Parade (1974, dir. Jacques Tati).  Leave a comment if there's any film you want me to expand on!"
TrueFilm,3altsy,afewthoughtsonfilm,2,Sun Jun 21 18:25:30 2015 UTC,"I need to see Parade again. I'm one of the biggest Tati freaks on Reddit, but I fell asleep halfway through. I didn't think it up to snuff with Tati at his best, and it was sort of a letdown...until I saw there was a Jon Rosenbaum piece saying he felt that it, along with Play Time, were Tati's best films. He includes it among his own pantheon of the 100 greatest movies ever. So naturally I'm curious what you thought about that, especially since you didn't seem to like Trafic (a favorite of mine, too!)  I saw some of the Les Blank stuff on Hulu Plus; it really intrigued me."
TrueFilm,3altsy,allhewhoknows,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:38:59 2015 UTC,"I knew Rosenbaum liked the film, but in his top 100?  I am definitely surprised by that.  While it doesn't quite reach the same heights as Playtime and Mon Oncle (which is my personal favorite), I think Parade is quite good in its own right.  Although it is a Tati film, it's unlike anything else Tati produced and it's hard to directly compare it to any of the others when everything from its visual style to its content is a complete departure from his previous work.  If you've seen some of the shorts Tati acted in, I would say it is most analogous to Evening Classes (which if you haven't seen it, you should, as its an absolute delight and was made on the set of Playtime as it was being made), as both Evening Classes and Parade are reflexive works that pay tribute to Tati's capabilities as a performer.  In particular, Parade deals more with the relationship between the audience and the performer, uniting the action of Tati's circus act with the live audience viewing it.  Tati says it best when he states near the beginning of the film that it's ""a show in which everyone's invited to participate.  The artists and clowns are you and me.""  Because Tati deals mostly with pantomime, he forces his audience to essentially imagine what it is he's doing; when, for example, he pantomimes playing tennis, it is our responsibility as the audience to imagine the ball being present.  In that way, he makes the audience part of the act itself.  In essence, the piece is a meta-textual exploration of the way in the audience simultaneously influences and is influenced by art, which is fairly interesting.  It's certainly a good film, but in a very different way.  I'm really digging Les Blank's approach to documentary.  They're all fairly short, which makes them really light treats.  He also made Burden of Dreams, the documentary about the making of Herzog's Fitzcarraldo, which I hear is also great (especially when considering what Fitzcarraldo is about)."
TrueFilm,3altsy,montypython22,7,Mon Jun 22 06:31:30 2015 UTC,"Saw some films that varied widely in content, but were all of similarly high quality, which is nice.  To Catch a Thief (1955) - Alfred Hitchcock  Well-made mystery caper thingy. I appreciate how artsy Hitchcock could get within mainstream boundaires. So much of this film is implied through purely visual means, it makes it feel less like a Hollywood Studio picture and more like an art film playing off Hollywood tropes. It’s beautiful to look at, and Cary Grant is a charismatic shit as always. 8/10  Fruitvale Station (2013) - Ryan Coogler  I like how much this movie strives to be about the life of it’s protagonist. While the event of police brutality may have been motivated by race, the victim is not only interesting when viewed as a black man kept down by white oppressors. The film shows us how he lives with the people around him on an everyday basis, making the gut punch at the end all the more gut-punch-y. And he’s not a generic superhero that could have cured cancer if given the chance either. He’s a more well-rounded, three-demensional character than most Based-On-True-Events movies are brave enough to make thier protagonists. The last few scenes are absolutely devastating. This is just a great film. 8/10  Nashville (1975) - Robert Altman  Saw this one in a packed cinema, which added to a lot of the enjoyment. A sharp satire with plenty of great characters, scenes and ideas on display. The music, although rarely meant to be taken seriously, I found myself really getting into. Rarely can such a film capture time and place so vividly as this. In minutes you become submerged in Nashville and it’s strange, strange inhabitants. Like the best satire, no one is safe and we’re all at least a little bit to blame.It can feel it’s length at points, but when the excellent finale occurs, I found myself wanting to stay in this world another hour. 8/10  The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) - John Ford  Perhaps my new favorite Western! The True Grit remake sure comes close, but I think this is a bit more poignant. This is my second John Ford outing, after The Searchers, and I found this one to be yet another intelligent meditation of problematic elements of the Western. In The Searchers it was racism towards the Native Americans, and here it’s gun violence and the moral implications of killing a man. It’s a movie that supports thinking over fighting. Spirited debate over gunslinging duels. Expertly shot and smartly written, it’s ideology stands up and remains relevant, even if a few elements are a bit funny today. I saw this in a packed cinema as well, and it actually played quite well as a comedy. People were busting a gut over many of Wayne’s mispronunciations and the oftentimes pantomime supporting performances. Some may view these as flaws, but I thought they really added to the experience. A very striking film. I must check out more John Ford. 9/10"

TrueFilm,3altsy,sbryce,8,Mon Jun 22 04:58:16 2015 UTC,"In order of preference:     Fish Tank Andrea Arnold, 2009.   Too long have I ignored recent British cinema. Apart from her Oscar-winning short Wasp and her latest Wuthering Heights I have not seen much out of Arnolds oeuvre. She is rightfully praised for both her writing and directorial skills, and Fish Tank is a moving, emotional and important film which ceases the viewer with its stylistic portrait of England ghettolife. Its a beautiful and at the same time disgusting film that is captured with an engaging eye. Some shots are just all out perfect, like the little girl running on the beach in slow motion. Beautiful camerawork and captivating writing really goes a long way. This film is a reason in itself to love and endorse indie cinema. 5/5.     Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans Werner Herzog, 2009.  This was one hell of a film. It works on so many different levels, blending so many different styles and qualities in various layers. It works as a cliché cop film, as a semi-political satire and even as a dumb drug-flick in the style of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I'm inspired by Herzogs decision to even make this from the start, and doing the way he did. You can watch it and go: ""well this is an absolute piece of cliché shit"", or just enjoy the superb acting by Nicholas Cage. You can even dive into the extremely well-executed critique of Hollywoods portrayal of racialized communities. Too me it had a few obvious problems but then I am not sure I picked up on every trail. As a viewer I was just crippled with possible interpretations that I sometimes felt like maybe it was just me overanalysing everything. When I read other reviews of this film, most people seem to miss out on the fact that it is such a complex film. It's just NOT what it looks like. Anyways, go see it - you'll both laugh at Cage's magnificent performance and feel terribly sad when you realise what Herzog is really trying to say. Plus there's some POV-shots from Iguanas. 4/5.    Altered States Ken Russel, 1980.  Never have I felt this weird after watching a film. I'm pretty sure it had som psycho-active effect on me because I felt actually high afterwards (!?). The long, intense audiovisual ""trips"" were interestingly composed and extremely captivating. I found out afterwards that it was nominated for Academy Awards for both best music and best sounddesign, which is undeniably understandable. Overall I think the technical aspects of the film were ingenuous and it really feels like it was before its time. I stumbled upon this movie by pure accident, and I was surprised I had never heard of it before. It seems like a forgotten cult classic, buried under the legacy of heaps of 90-indie-cult films. The subject, dialogue and technical winnings of Russel and original writer Paddy Chayefsky (under the pseudonym Sidney Aaron) is outstanding, although narratively and plot-wise I was not too impressed. In total a superbly weird, mind boggling film with traces of pure genius. Probably 4/5.    Cries and Whispers Ingmar Bergman, 1972. Rewatch.  This is my second go trying to enjoy this film as much as others, but I don't seem capable of. In light of Bergmans other films I just can't appreciate this enough. To me it falls flat, with a mildly interesting but inherently boring story, if I am allowed to use such words. He deals with the same themes so much better in other films. For me it's the same as watching Scorsese films; I'm just not interested. And that being said, I truly love Bergman. Don't know what more to say. 3/5.     The Pledge Sean Penn, 2001.   I watched this film because Ebert praised it. Why, I don't really know. It's an outdrawn, quasi insightful movie that didn't move me. Maybe I'm just sick of overprotective men protecting little girls, I mean is there a more exploited concept? Although this film is pre-Taken, which saves me from completely hating it. Not only did The Pledge make me less interested in Penn as a director, but it also proved my point that Ebert isn't as insightful of a filmcritic as he is known to be. Some aspects of the film, like the camerawork and depiction of a man sliding into possible madness did please me though. I do love Penns Into The Wild, and theres some connections between these two films that also gets me.  Weak 3/5.     Lost River Ryan Gosling, 2015.   Goslings directorial debut features some very strong visual experiences but is profoundly underdeveloped and, frankly, dumb in its writing. I wish he would have not written this himself. He has such an unique talent for directing, and with his experience in recent years with outstanding indie films and directors he truly has a good eye for moody dramas. Unfortunately not for writing. I'm hoping to see him develop and his career surely looks promising. Strong 2/5."
TrueFilm,3altsy,23553,7,Sun Jun 21 16:54:16 2015 UTC,"I haven't done this before but I watched a lot of cool movies this weekend and figured I'd share. I hope I'm doing it right.  The Aviator (2004) - Dir. Martin Scorsese  A very beautiful movie.  The use of color throughout the film added to the intensity that DiCaprio brought to the character.  There were great performances all around. John C. Reilly really nailed the straight man, which is quite the change from everything else I've seen him in.  Great historical movie that everyone should check out. - 5/5  '71 (2014) - Dir. Yann Demange  A mix of military action and ""escape"" movie. Perfectly paced to amp up the chase/fight scenes but really hit you with big moments that leave you in awe. The Irish accents were a little hard to understand at times, but a very solid movie overall. - 4/5  High Fidelity (2000) - Dir. Stephen Frears  I really dig movies where the main character breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience.  Especially when the other characters aren't aware of it.  John Cusack really nailed the depressed but funny record store owner and his two ""annoying"" employees (Jack Black and Todd Louiso) have some excellent lines and decent character arcs.  It took me awhile to figure out what kind of movie I was watching.  It seemed like a romantic one, then a break up movie, by the end I realized it was a ""slice of life"" where the character isn't getting or losing much throughout but he is learning to be a better person.  It dragged in places but overall its charm makes it worth a watch.  - 3.5/5  The Movie Hero (2003) - Dir. Brad T. Gottfred  A love letter to anyone who loves movies as much as I do.  Its plot about a villian stealing people's audiences is just there to move the main plot about a normal guy who believes he is the star of a movie.  His attempts to entertain the audience are what makes the movie great.  Due to the character's awareness of his movie, they include main movie cliches but have the ""hero"" point them out with dismay since he is doing his best to avoid them.  I'd have trouble recommending The Movie Hero to your average person, but if you really love movies then the humor and commentary about movies in The Movie Hero will delight you. - 3/5"

TrueFilm,3altsy,TwoChocolateBalls,6,Mon Jun 22 06:40:00 2015 UTC,"Andrei Rublev (1966) -- 10/10  The power of Andrei Rublev is in its story, especially the fine details and intricacies of its story. In other words, if you were to watch this film alongside a blind person, and had to narrate and relay everything about the film, I am very confident that this would then be the blind person's favorite film. Try it! Mutter to yourself what you can see in the frame and you will experience the perfection of Tarkovsky's complex vision and composition.  In addition, Tarkovsky stuffs so much ambition into this epic tale of a Russian Iconographer, that the photography is just bursting at the seams. The commentary brought along about art, faith, and the delicacy of the human spirit up against the adversity and doom of mortality is unrivaled, unparalleled.  The beginning of this film is masterful and incredible, one that is up there with the likes of 8 1/2's opening, and is one that packages all the motifs this film will unwrap throughout the monumental voyage. The beginning starts with a man desperate to finish a hot air balloon, so he can get up into the sky. This illustrates the difficulties, the ambition, and the paranoia surrounding artists in the 15th century, and what Andrei Rublev and his fellow iconographers (and bellmakers :0) will go through. On top of that, as the balloon is finishing up, an angry mob (with motives unbeknownst to us) tries to thwart the completion. This then exemplifies the foreign (Tatars) savagery and disdain that will come to the light. However, the man gets on the balloon and begins to fly. This sequence is unbelievable: the camera is floating ever so slightly upwards, from the perspective of the flying man, as he shouts in disbelief and joy. The aspect of flight is figurative in the sense of faith and ""outer-body experiences"", along with the few successes the film will bring forth. Sadly, these successes are in vain, as Andrei Rublev will show, and his hot air balloon crashes to the ground, next to a horse on its back. The horse on its back is perhaps the strongest symbol that Tarkovsky could show, a disheartening juxtaposition of helplessness and playfulness, beauty and doubt.  Cries and Whispers (1972) -- 10/10  Funny that this film is called Cries and Whispers, because when I was watching I felt like crying and found myself whispering under my breath. That is how moving and destructive this movie is.  Cries and Whispers is really just a tale of four women who are commanded and twisted by emotion, passion, hatred, sexuality, anger, and love. What really brings out these four women and their state of minds is the backdrop and the blanket of the color red. The walls, the furniture, and even the transitions are blood red; it overpowers the viewer, and surges out of the frame. Just like it grabs the viewer, red's pathos engulfs these four women in exuberant, blinding passion.  The signature touch that Ingmar Bergman brings to this film is impossible to overstate. The photography is as delicate and exuberant as the women are, and the actresses in this picture execute masterful performances. If there is one clear technique that can be mastered by watching Cries and Whispers, that would be zoom. Zoom is utilized like I could never imagine, and fits with the tone: graceful, serene, but angry and unsettling.  Cries and Whispers doesn't have a subtext at all, on the contrary to many other films of Bergman's, but is only occupied with hitting the audience like a force of nature.  In addition, its goal isn't to cleverly send a political or even a philosophical hidden message, but to mirror in the audience the emotions of these eccentric, exhilarating, and depressed women. To weave you into being the fourth sister. To create one of the most striking and jarring dramas ever. In those regards, and in simple filmmaking regards, it delivers and then some.  Jurassic Park (1993) -- 6/10  Take Spielberg out and what do you have? Scream 5 with some better one-liners. Jurassic Park is probably responsible for how every big shot Hollywood director shoots their blockbusters: ever-flowing movement with the camera, and a hatred of static shots. It works here, but is overdone now.  An Autumn Afternoon (1962) -- 10/10  As I watch more and more of Yasujiro Ozu's films, I believe that no other filmmaker is able to depict family and its tribulations in such an exceptional, truthful, and brutally honest way.  When shooting one's home, Ozu makes an effort to include the ground in his shots. He does this to create a sense of comfort and familiarity, and most importantly, illustrates these homes with a dimension never seen in cinema, much like Orson Welles did with ceilings in Citizen Kane. This also means that actors didn't have the helpful aid of blocking markers on the ground. I don't how much of an effect that had, but I would imagine that Ozu then allowed freedom in the movement of his actors, generating genuine movement.  All of Ozu's films are like a nice, warm cup of tea. He brews up characters and their interactions with each other through conversation and connection, ones that may or may not bring conflict. Once it is done brewing, he lets you taste and enjoy the characters, the atmosphere, and the environment, by using subtle, sweet aesthetics. Though it may be simple, it brings tremendous beauty and contentment. As you bask in the warm sweetness of the story, Ozu concocts small conflicts, all of which are either trivial or fun to watch. Finally, as we take a gulp and the crux of the film arrives, the indescribable emotion Ozu conjures burns like no other film, as it is a surprise and is something utterly relatable. Unlike a cup of tea however, you find yourself weeping to this unsuspecting wave of emotion. And when you finally sip the last sip and the credits are rolling, it leaves you with a bittersweet taste in your mouth, one that is part pleasure and part grief.  American Splendor (2003) -- 8/10  The most noticeable aspect of American Splendor is how it utilizes all filmmaking tools in its toolbox. Among others, it uses animation, shatters the fourth wall, and shows 3 different dimensions of its characters. Though Harvey Pekar is a little egotistical, this film is about personas, not egos.  Harvey once mentions the major disparity between him and his fictional self: one will live on forever. What this movie does is use the real Harvey as narrator, thus reflecting that perspective, as an observer and analyst of his past, and his other personas.  One of the most intriguing parts of Harvey's life story is that despite all of the publicity he received (i.e. David Letterman's talk show), fame eluded him. However mysterious this is, he always seemed to subconsciously step out of the spotlight. His wife says at one point that he has OCD, and though there isn't any proof of that, his actions keep backing up that claim. Most people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder tend to despise change, due to a strict routine. Though he doesn't appear to have a clear routine, change is something he doesn't strive for. When encountering potential life-altering situations, those alleged OCD instincts tell him to gravitate towards the familiar.  Interestingly, Harvey doesn't have a character arc, but somehow that doesn't detract from the viewer's helpless attachment and sorrow for Harvey. You may say, ""if this is a biographical film about a dude who doesn't change, how is it in any way interesting?"" Well, the casting of the real Harvey Pekar as the narrator of his own life is how. What it accomplishes is it puts us in the brain of the person who knows Harvey the best: himself.  Every decision made by the director(s) is made to divulge and absorb the audience inward towards Harvey's own conscience, both his conscience as it was present, and his conscience as he is looking back on his past."

I've only seen Early Spring and Early Summer out of his ""season"" films but your comment made me remember I need to see his other films.

TrueFilm,3altsy,Inception_025,12,Mon Jun 22 16:53:12 2015 UTC,"Kung Fu Panda 2 Directed by Jennifer Yuh (2011)- Kinda forgot these films existed until the trailer for the new one came out then it clicked, they’re making those sweet China bucks with these movies, but also I remembered the first one being alright. This one was alright too. Has some similarities to How to Train Your Dragon 2 also. We’re repeating some of the same emotional beats, the hero is on a journey to discover their origins, and the world is expanded through technology and mysticism. Where most of my enjoyment came from though was just seeing how differently they visualised the fighting style of each animal. They really make you believe in the lethality of a peacock. That peacock villain was great, felt like the most I’ve seen/heard Gary Oldman act in a while as he’s often just cast as stern shouty guy or something. Animation is good but it feels even more like a kids film than most of its contemporaries. Mainly in the humour that often interrupts whatever’s happening for an extended “Po is fat” gag before we can move on while HTTYD2 and even Big Hero Six didn’t feel like they were interrupting the flow of things with their low-hanging-fruit jokes so it was easier to overlook the stuff that wasn’t for me. Overall it was ok, some really good animation and imagination, but I wasn’t too swept away. Certainly above Dreamworks late Shrek period but still not quite there. Gets something that many big action films don’t get though and that’s that action scenes should be about something beyond stuff smashing. It gets that for action scenes to fully land they must be an extension of the story and a visualisation of what the characters are going through. Does that kind of thing well. Plus James Hong gets his best acting role in years and nails it bringing most of the emotion the film has. Part of the disconnect might be that real kung-fu movies exist and I could be watching them, which would also explain a bit why I enjoyed it more the more fantastical it got.   Interview with the Vampire Directed by Neil Jordan (1994)- Meant to see this for a while and now it’s out of the way. It’s an intermittently fun and sumptuous vampire tale with Tom Cruise and Brad pitted against each other (sorry). At times the melodramatic and psychologically concerned story works bringing out concepts that seem intrinsic to vampire lore but haven’t really been explored, and sometimes the bigness of things is just plain entertaining. But you can really tell this is based on a sprawling book series. It’s all just thing happening after thing happening with rarely a moment to sink into things enough to actually care about what’s happening. Any big moment was met with an “ok” rather than a gasp or shock, it’s just more stuff happening. Neil Jordan’s imagination (or budget) seems unable to keep up with the pace of the plot and it’s only every so often that we get a shot that really captures the romantic gothic vibe he’s going for. Enjoyable performances and pieces but feels more like a series of “what if vampires were like this?” moments than an impactful whole.   Pathfinder Directed by Nils Gaup (1987)- Set around 1000 AD this Norwegian survival fable tells a familiar story through a unique cultural lens. Young hunter kid returns home one day to find raiders over the body of his family, he runs away, they’re on his tail. It’s one of those. Not a non-stop fast paced chase film though. It begins promisingly with beautifully ethereal shots of snow and by jumping right into the action, but it loses its steam as it goes on. Seeing this place and time on screen feels fresh at times while at others disappointingly familiar. I wish it had delved even deeper into the mystic beliefs of these people and their mythology as those scenes are fascinating. For me it didn’t manage to hit too hard as it straddled between two focuses. On one hand the characters are broad and a little flat because this is a retelling of a folk tale, but there’s enough traditional character stuff that it makes you wish you cared about these people beyond the general “they’re good and the other dudes are bad”. These kind of gripes come from some of it being so strong. Some of the action scenes are ok but by the end it was hard to tell how much of this I was enjoying purely because it’s a time period and place we rarely see on screen or if it was actually well made. Of course some of it is certainly well made and there’s a bear fight in particular that makes you believe the making was much more dangerous than I imagine it was, but sometimes it gets a little stale. Cool little film, definitely worth checking out if you’re interesting in Scandinavian folk tales or just stories within this time period but not necessarily something that’d win you over if you’re not already intrigued.   Red Beard Directed by Akira Kurosawa (1965)- Even though there’s no connection between the two Red Beard really underlined how much my interest in Game of Thrones has waned of late. I’m still watching the show but don’t really find myself that into it, it’s more like checking in to see what is happening than actually feeling anything. Red Beard has one action scene with most of it taking place in one shot and it had me more amped than this entire season of Game of Thrones. It felt great to watch action that doesn’t cut on every freaking movement or only hold onto long takes for flashy single moments. Seeing Toshiro Mifune as a somewhat surly doctor break a bunch of dudes bones I was smiling and laughing and loving every second of it. Only lasts a couple minutes but it was more propulsive, coherent, and badass than GoT has been in ages. It’s a scene that feels like Kurosawa just discovered how to make a really great bone-snapping sound effect and wanted to use it a whole bunch. Goes to show how far brilliant filmmaking can take you without the need for extensive effects of any kind. The rest of the film is less exciting but still a great watch. The Hidden Fortress was enjoyable but felt like a bit of a step down visually (not by a great deal since it’s Kurosawa we’re talking about) so it was great to return to something that just looks perfect in every frame. We get the kind of story that’s the prototype for most of the hospital drama’s ever made except this Dr House will break dudes bones if they deserve it. A young upstart doctor gets forced into a job under the known-to-be-difficult Toshiro Mifune and we see his slow transition from hating his place here, to finding his place, and so on. As interesting as the core drama is there’s also so much else going on. This may be the most class-concerned Kurosawa film I’ve ever seen and there’s even a touch of Mizoguchi to the whole thing as it is so critical of the time it is in and by extension how sadly so little of these things have changed. Women’s place in feudal Japan and the treatment of women in particular was where the Mizoguchi was felt. How these guys approach filmmaking is very different though. At 3 and a half hours or so it occasionally loses its grip but it’s constantly introducing new stories and reintroducing elements from earlier in the film that it completely earns its length. Red Beard is probably the most successfully I’ve seen Kurosawa do drama, as engaging as his adventure movies and even better than some of them. This is top Mifune too. He’s on beard strokin’ bone breakin’ top form in a quieter role than we usually get to see him in but which he nails completely.   They Might Be Giants Directed by Anthony Harvey (1971)- George C Scott stars as a man who used to be a judge that now believes himself to be Sherlock Holmes. His brother wants him put in a mental asylum but he needs a doctor from the place to sign off on it. Jumping at the chance to inspect such a fascinating case is a female psychiatrist called Dr Watson. Unlike last weeks Time After Time with Malcolm McDowell as time travelling H.G. Wells this was just as fun as the synopsis makes it sound. From very early on we know Scott's not “really” Sherlock but what the film keeps asking is if that really matters. There’s no doubt about this man being troubled but he’s found new meaning in his life through this fantasy and even passes that on to others. In some ways the film is very ahead of its time in its acceptance of this kind of outsider lifestyle, of finding meaning and contentment in being something that you’re technically not. There’s a real compassion and warmth to the whole thing brought out perfectly by George C Scott who makes a killer Holmes. He can be the brash and barking man he needs to be in one moment while showing the broken man beneath it all in another. Whenever the film feels a little hokey he brings an emotional reality to things that makes one excuse some issues. Seems like a big influence on The Fisher King, that film now seems like it’s more of an expansion on images seen in this than its own unique thing. As with many 70s films it’s also a time capsule of this New York, even more so than some as the seemingly low budget has Scott in Sherlock garb running around so much of the city amongst what often seems to be normal folk on the street. Doesn’t quite maintain the delightful strength of its beginning  but it doesn’t completely lose it either."
TrueFilm,3altsy,LuigiVanPeebles,6,Sun Jun 21 14:10:41 2015 UTC,"Topsy-Turvy Directed by Mike Leigh (1999)- Most of what I knew of Gilbert and Sullivan came from Sideshow Bob Singing the H.M.S. Pinafore and such so I was ready for a Mr Turner-esque encapsulation of an artist but that wasn’t quite what this was. Topsy-Turvy is sprawling. We’re following Gilbert write a new musical, Sullivan struggle with not wanting to write music for Gilberts work, all of the actors behind the scenes, and basically everyone in the lives of Gilbert and Sullivan during the lead up to and performance of The Mikado. It touches on so many different things. We get a look at a time in Britain that seems more open to cultural melding than we do today and a Britain with a fascination rather than distaste for other cultures. It also offers an insight into the lives and minds of those behind a famous opera, how they negotiated the mores of the time, and the conflicts that can make great art possible. This seems like a film made for actors and those in the theatre as it lets those two aspects shine through. For me though it may be the Leigh film that has interested me the least (maybe even more than Another Year). Not that it’s bad but it didn't have the impact of anything else of his I’ve seen. Mr Turner was helped by not being traditionally biopic-y but this has more of those familiar touches. Also its reach is so large that it doesn’t hit on any one thing strong enough to make them really land. More of a collection of funny brilliant performances and excellent scenes that don’t quite come together all the time. Seems more made for those already interested than anyone as his other work does. Certainly very enjoyable at times and Dick Pope always makes a Leigh film look great.   Young Mr Lincoln Directed by John Ford (1939)- John Ford seems like the biggest victim of the modern assumption that we (and by extension cinema) have become more sophisticated as time goes on. When I was younger (by even just a few years) I mistook the apparent simplicity of his films for lack of depth when now the more I watch the more I see the quiet poetry he imbues his films with. Young Mr Lincoln is about Lincoln becoming a lawyer and tackling his first case but also makes for as grand a testament to the man as Spielbergs attempt. I liked Lincoln ok but this is a different beast. Daniel Day Lewis gets plenty make-up, changes his voice, and does so much to look and sound like Lincoln. For Henry Ford it mainly takes a great fake nose and lighting, mainly the lighting though, and he is Lincoln. He’s the face from the statues and coins. He’s the man that sounds like legend yet somehow existed. That’s the key dichotomy that Ford captures perfectly here. Through the whole thing it has the look and feel of an American folk tale. Lincoln is how we imagine him to be and more. Yet it still has the historical element of being based on true events and showing what literally happened to Lincoln. With this mix of the folky and the factual Ford gets across the brilliance of the man. A man who sounds too good to be true, better than people can actually be, but he wasn’t and us keep telling ourselves that will keep us from being as great. He’s mythologised for being smart and decent, something that shouldn’t be rare but is. Not that it’s as simple as that. At all times Fonda’s Lincoln is both the real man and the dream. An attainable glory that people don’t aspire to enough despite his stature in our culture. He understands people, cares for them even though they falter, and does it all with wit and compassion. The only place the film loses me is in some of the court scenes mainly because I have a general dislike of lots of scenes of uproarious laughter at things that aren’t that funny. The fact it’s happening in a courtroom enhances the silliness even more. But even that makes a good point. That the idea of great leaders being barking respect grabbers is a fallacy, goodness captures the heart and mind more than fear ever can. All these kind of idealistic beliefs are what the film makes you believe in again even if just for a moment. And that captures why Lincoln has been so mythologised. As of now this might be my favourite Ford film. It doesn’t just show who Lincoln was but also why people love him and why he has so defined American culture. I’d always read Kurosawa was influenced by classic Western directors like Ford and oddly here I noticed it the most. The kind of perfect lighting and blocking I’d loved in the interior scenes of The Searchers are what this films full of and really it makes me realise I gotta see more of Ford’s early stuff. What keeps it so connected to reality isn’t just the facts though, it is Henry Ford’s performance and the characterisation of Lincoln. Both lend a sensitivity to the man with tenderness that make him feel all the more real. Even when the shadows on his face make him look like a statue the look in his eyes remind you he’s a man. This is the kind of patriotic American film I can get behind because it seems like something to get patriotic about. It’s pure americana highlighting the greatness of goodness with beauty, humour, and sincerity. So aware of the flaws of the country but with the belief that you’ll overcome them."
TrueFilm,3altsy,eliphas_levi,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:10:57 2015 UTC,"I think there was an additional trick to shooting Young Mr. Lincoln that I never looked into: they make him look taller than everyone else. Fonda was already pretty tall I guess but that doesn't usually come across in movies where people tend to look the same size.  Even if Pathfinder is a disappointment it sounds right up my alley. You probably saw Bubba Ho-tep right,  They Might Be Giants reminds me of that.  I often think about why that is re: Game of Thrones. It isn't the only show that has that problem, I think maybe the writers get worn out after a few years and the show directors lose the time and freedom to stage anything creatively. So any sense of unified vision gets lost when that's what you need to cover all that narrative ground and have it form into a meaningful story. Hard to blame people when they stop watching because this leads to big mistakes sometimes. It's like when the Red Wedding episode was instantly canonized as the best episode of the show yet when everything before then hadn't really built toward it as a satisfying tragic story and then the direction was only okay. Sometimes when a show knows it's gonna be renewed they tie off everything going on and then completely shake up everything but Game of Thrones doesn't have that option."
TrueFilm,3altsy,Tallain,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:51:50 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah they really make him gangly. His legs often take up as much of the frame as he does.   I still have not seen Bubba Ho-Tep, really should.   They seem to be rushing to keep things perpetually shocking and cool but yeah without the build up it's just meaningless. They also just don't know how to shoot action satisfyingly, their reach exceeds their grasp."
TrueFilm,3altsy,HuddahHuddahHuddah,3,Sun Jun 21 16:56:27 2015 UTC,"Glad to see you loved Red Beard, I agree totally with you on everything you said in that review. With Game of Thrones, I haven't been watching this season, but I just finished reading all the books, and god, the last two books that made this past season have been so dreadfully long and boring. There's few exciting moments, and it just all built up so that it could say ""look at all these cliffhangers"". It's interesting that Red Beard made you think of Game of Thrones going a little down hill. But I do agree that the fight scene you're talking about is extremely badass. I really love how it shows that the man who has the knowledge and power to help the weak, also has the knowledge and power to destroy. It paints the doctor as a man who has access to both good and evil, and chooses good. He's a moral man who has the ability to do immoral things. It's also definitely one of Mifune's best performances. As much as I love him, a lot of his performances are just a lot of yelling and scowling. In Red Beard his performance is yelling and scowling with the addition of lots of soft, quiet, restrained moments. We get to see that the anger and scariness of the character is all an act put on to make everyone around him obey."
TrueFilm,3altsy,therealchriswei,5,Sun Jun 21 14:55:15 2015 UTC,"A Bay of Blood (Twitch of the Death Nerve) (1971): This latter-day stab-em-up from Mario Bava is often singled out for it's influence on the American slashers of the 1980's. It's set around a body of water, a group of rowdy teens makes for promising machete-bait, and a couple of the kill scenes were directly imitated a decade later in Friday the 13th Part 2. The storyline in A Bay of Blood (if you can find it), however, is more like a gory, outdoor version of Clue. A smorgasbord of adults in corded sweaters run frantically from house to house, suspicious of everyone as anonymous hands stab, spear, and strangle their numbers into decline. The opaque plot is compounded by poor visual cues and confusing close-up shots, and furthermore by the film's multiple releases under dozens of titles, each seeming to have worse audio quality than the last.   A Bay of Blood is a fun piece of horror history, and worth having in your dossier if you are a fan of 70's Italian gore or 80's teen slashers, but, in a vacuum, it serves best as an example of what not to do when trying to tell a coherent story. I'd like to see a contemporary remake of this one.  The Legend of Boggy Creek (1972): I have long been a collector of Bigfoot lore. Not because I believe in the existence of such a creature (I don't), but because of the way this myth of the wildman reflects on those that do. The Legend of Boggy Creek is a pseudo-fictional documentary reporting and reenacting tales of the three-toed Fouke Monster, a Sasquatch-like creature rumored to lurk through the woods of southern Arkansas. Despite the fantastic subject matter of the film, at it's heart is an affectionate ethnography of life in rural America during the 1950's and 60's. Director Charles B. Pierce uses Fouke locals to share stories and folklore. His camera takes time to stop and smell the roses, hear the birds chirp, and watch the muskrats swim. A campy but charming soundtrack of original folk tunes sings us songs about the wilderness, and its inhabitants.   It would be easy to dismiss this as a dated genre piece, but is this a movie about a monster, or about the things we see in the woods? It is fantasy, but is surprisingly insightful about the truths that fuel those fantasies. Sasquatch sightings are confessions of loneliness manifesting themselves in fear or longing, and I think that truth bares out sympathetically in the underbrush of The Legend of Boggy Creek. ""Yes, he's still here, and, you know, I'd almost like to hear that terrible cry again. Just to be reminded that there is still a bit of wilderness left, and there are mysteries that remain unsolved, and strange unexplained noises in the night.""  The River Wild (1994): Conflict on the river rapids. Meryl Streep as the strong, savvy, yet vulnerable leader. Kevin Bacon as the persistently affable, but suspect stranger, David Strathairn as the well-intentioned, but emotionally reserved dad. And Joseph Mazzello as the child prop. Everybody is in their wheelhouse here, and making an honest day's work of it. So, where does this movie go wrong?  Director Curtis Hanson (LA Confidential, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle) has some wins and some losses under his belt. Even The River Wild is professionally done. It's setting is beautiful. It's actors are capable. It's premise is functional, but the story doesn't give us anything beyond what our laziest imaginations might churn out upon first meeting all of the primary characters. You've probably already written an accurate recreation of the story's third act in your head while reading these words. This movie is a river of it's own. We know where to get in. We know where we'll get out. The course is set. The hazards are well-charted. Let's just enjoy the scenery.  Death Wish (1974): Frontier justice in the wild wild upper west side. This was an interesting little bit of history about America's fear of urban culture and white flight from urban cores. Paul Kersey's (Charles Bronson) vigilante justice is dolled out brutally as he brings a gun to one knife fight after another, quick on the draw and plugging people in the back as they run away or lie face-down already gut-shot. It's nasty, but his hand has been forced, and somebody's got to clean up this town. Maybe. After watching, I wasn't sure weather the old west parallels were meant to justify Kersey's violence, or as a critique on the idea of the man in the white hat. He goes so overboard in his retribution, at one point telling an unarmed man to ""fill his hands"". Maybe he's not supposed to be the guy in the white hat, after all.  A couple of other general observations about Death Wish: Race. The movie goes to great lengths to avoid portraying Kersey's violence as racially motivated. The criminals he slays are ethnically balanced, if not majority white. I wonder how this jives with the rhetoric on crime of the time period, and how this potential inconsistency reflects the movie's intentions. Religion. At least twice we are shown a coven of nuns skulking silently by with their heads down shortly before murders occur. Is this meant to show just another establishment of authority turning a blind eye to the social conditions begetting crime, further validating Kersey's actions, or something else? Ultimately, this one brought more questions for me than answers. Another brick in the wall of 70's American fear of otherness, or a reflective commentary on that fear? Probably both."
TrueFilm,3altsy,Alexxandros,6,Sun Jun 21 15:13:07 2015 UTC,"Diary of A Country Priest (1951, Robert Bresson) - My first Bresson. It was slow, but I got into it after they introduced the main source of drama in the film. In the beginning the constant barrage of short scenes which fade into each other with dissolve cuts was a bit jarring, but as the scenes became longer it was much easier to watch. The lead performance was pretty amazing, I don't think I've ever seen a character suffering as convincingly as here. The camera movement and lighting were very interesting. There were many moments where the camera would move towards a character. It made the film feel really intimate and added drama. It essentially substituted an emotional cut to close up of face by doing the same thing through camera movement, and it made those moments feel a lot more genuine. The lighting... I can't explain it, but in so many scenes, light was clearly coming from many directions, and somehow you'd think the characters would move from light to shadow as they walked around, but they were constantly brightly lit. I skipped back to watch a few scenes again, and noticed that the whole film has a really low contrast look. Also, the voiceover worked really well in this film. I'll definitely be watching this again soon, as on the first watch it was a bit hard to follow what all the characters were saying though subtitled.  The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939, William Dieterle) - What an epic film. Where do I begin? Charles Laughton steals the show. (Sanctuary! Sanctuary!) The character introduction was done so well, barely any dialogue but none is needed with how Laughton acts with his body in heavy makeup and costume. I feel that if the book was adapted again today, there would be more attempt to make Quasimodo seem human. He'd probably speak more, be shown as more empathic. But this film never forgets that Quasimodo is a deformed, deaf outcast who has spent his life on top of a tower. The only time he ever says a few consecutive lines of dialogue, he speaks about how ugly he is. I liked the social commentary in the film. It was quite heavy handed, but still remarkably relevant today. I don't know if it's lifted from the book or was added in the script, but it would make it even more impressive if the relevant commentary comes straight from a novel that was published in 1831. Issues of immigration, tyranny, democracy, coming into modernity (represented here by the printing press, nowadays by the internet) are all touched upon. Reading the plot summary of the book on Wikipedia reveals that the film's ending is a lot less tragic, and in the film democracy wins as the king listens to the people, while in the book it is the opposite. It would've been interesting to see the book adapted more faithfully.  The Tales of Hoffmann (1951, Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger) - I decided I wanted more Powell & Pressburger after watching The Red Shoes last week. This film also featured elaborately staged ballet sequences, gorgeous production designs and costumes, and a few familiar faces, such as Moira Shearer and Ludmilla Tcherina. Sadly what it severely lacked is any form of character development. At the intermission of a ballet, Hoffmann is drinking with some students, and decides to tell 3 tales of women he has loved. All these stories follow a similar formula - he quickly falls madly in love, but finds that he can't be with the woman he loves. The only thing that links these stories is Hoffmann himself and we never find out anything about him other than the fact that he is a ""poet"". Sadly, due to this I didn't care for what was happening at all, and the opera being as long as it got tiring towards the end. (real operas have intermissions...) There were a few creative cinematic moments, but not ones I'd consider watching the whole film again for. I really liked Léonide Massine's performance here, both his dancing and his ability to act with only a few facial expressions. Sadly it looks like he has only acted in two major films, both of which I have now seen.  The Small Back Room (1949, Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger) - This was very different from the other two films by P&P that I've seen. Black and white, no musical scenes, all action takes place in real locations rather than on stage. The script worked quite well here. The events take place during WWII and we're introduced to our main character when a soldier requests his help in reverse-engineering a device that has killed several people. This story ties the film together, but mostly it is a character study of the protagonist, Sammy Rice. I really enjoyed the way the character was written. His basic traits reminded me a lot of Gregory House; Sammy Rice is an academic who's at odds with his boss (he believes his boss's motives are incompatible with the scientific work he does), he has an injured leg which causes him to constantly be in pain, and as a result of dealing with the pain, he has developed a substance abuse problem. The performances were very good, and once again P&P treated some moments very creatively - at one point, waiting at home, Sammy is irritated by the clock, and is tempted by the whisky. Then, clocks fill the room and become overwhelming, while the bottle becomes bigger than Sammy himself, like it's going to crush him. There's even a bit of filmmaker humour here as purposeless tech-talk at a meeting is drowned out by the sound of drilling - who cares about that stuff anyway. Overall, this is just a very solid film, one I'd definitely recommend.  Shane (1953, George Stevens) - My first non-spaghetti Western. Enjoyed the cinematography in this one, all the compositions were very balanced - either characters occupied the centre of the frame, or if there were multiple characters, they were given equal-ish amounts of space and there was a clear visual separation between them. No going overboard with the colours either. One particular fight scene went on for too long and the execution of the fast cuts could've been better, but otherwise the pacing was good. What made this film stand out is the ending and the mystery in the main character. Barely anything is revealed about the protagonist, but at the beginning he's clearly startled by the sound of a gun being pulled, and he's shown to be an excellent shot. But he's too eloquent, too squeaky clean to just be some gunfighter. He comes across a farm on which a family lives, and instantly develops a bond with the son. There's also this weird tension between him and the kid's mother. I couldn't shake the feeling that the kid was Shane's son, but that's probably my modern brain expecting some sort of plot twist as soon as there is any vague allusion to it. Now the ending... until that point, the film is fairly ordinary. But towards the end, two things happen. First is an excellent fistfight scene, where not only are the men fighting, but the animals are going wild, breaking down the fences and making all sorts of noise. That really added a chaotic feel to everything. Then the final shootout, Jack Palance plays a meanie like no one else. In the final shootout, they start putting objects in the foreground, really close to the camera. It really exaggerates the depth of the shot and makes everything look super dramatic. Such a simple idea, such great effect. Quite liked this, reckon I'll be checking out some other classic Westerns."
TrueFilm,3altsy,EeZB8a,6,Sun Jun 21 22:51:15 2015 UTC,"Ex Machina  A sometimes thoughtful film with smart dialog, shot with a good eye. I can't say I'm surprised at how much I love this movie, with Alex Garland at the helm. I've loved his work since The Beach and 28 Days Later..., and now I'm really looking forward to Halo if he is still writing that. There were a ton of seemingly one-off lines in this film, parts of other discussions, that could easily have grown to early Stark Trek levels of philosophical bloat, but gracefully let them pass to let the story flow, and I really appreciated that. I found myself understanding and rooting for each of the characters, and the ending kind of saddened me while also making me feel strangely good.  Outside the story, while Domhnall Gleeson delivered a good performance, Oscar Isaac really stole the show. Man, he's good. I'm excited to see more of him.  8/10  Jurassic World  I left the theater feeling exhilarated, but the feeling was soon gone and I was left with... nothing, really. A fun but ultimately empty summer blockbuster that pales in the shadow of Jurassic Park.  The actors did the best with what they were given, which really wasn't much. There was a shift in tone (or cinematic language, or whatever) during a certain part that really made me question if the filmmakers knew what they were doing at all, and then everything shifted back and that was equally jarring. It's been ages since I've seen Jurassic Park III, but going by memory I would rate this just above that and The Lost World, but just barely. Only because The Lost World had that annoying kid, and I don't remember III.  5/10  The Exorcist  As a lover of horror it's amazing I haven't seen this before. Some of the stuff they show in this movie would absolutely shock people today. I can't imagine the reactions in theaters back then. Just, wow.  9/10  The Godfather: Part II  My co-worker has refused to speak to me until I saw this movie, and now I've finally seen it. I didn't enjoy it as much as the first, but it is still better than most movies. De Niro delivered such a great performance.  8/10  Space Pirate Captain Harlock  Two words: SPACE BATTLES. The story is cheesy and predictable, but this movie has everything that a lot of recent sci-fi has been lacking: SPACE BATTLES, an interesting galaxy, hard decisions for people to make. It was fun while it lasted, and the visuals were absolutely incredible.  6.5/10"
TrueFilm,3altsy,lordhadri,4,Mon Jun 22 07:58:56 2015 UTC,"I'll list the three that I can remember the best:  The Sixth Sense (1999) In my opinion, this is M. night Shyamalan's best film. It has great acting including a great child performance, great camerawork, good composition of shots and framing, and it is one of the few films I can recall where Bruce Willis steps out of his comfort zone(action) and acts as a different character for a change(drama/thriller). A very notable thing that I noticed upon rewatching this is that there's little use of score. I've noticed directors will do this intentionally to make certain scenes more engaging. For example, the final scene between Cole and his mother was fairly silent. Therefore the only sound(s) we can be focused on is the dialogue being shared between the characters. So any emotion they were conveying is easily better felt by the audience. I'm pretty certain this was done intentionally by M. Night for that particular reason.   After my rewatch, this still stays as one of my favorite movies of all time. 10/10  Alien 3 (1992) Alien is my favorite horror movie of all time, with Aliens being one of my favorite action movies of all time. So this movie was pretty disappointing. I can't really hate this movie, though. To be honest, on a technical level it was fairly well done. I haven't watched much of David Fincher's work, but I can already tell this is far from being his best. A big problem I have with this movie is the Alien itself. The xenomorph looks good when it's done with practical effects, especially the close-ups and ventilation shots. But the shots of it running down the corridors and after prisoners look about as good as the 1930's King Kong film. With the previous 2 movies known for their impressive creature effects, this is a pretty noticeable downgrade. Alien and Aliens were able to get around such problems by shooting in dark areas or not showing much of the xenomorph at all, so how it fails at this in a prison setting with very few lit areas is beyond me.  Overall, very underwhelming movie. 6/10  The Exorcist (1973) Speaking of horror films, this movie blew me away. I wasn't expecting such a graphic film from so early in cinema. The acting was great with the performances being driven forward with well-written dialogue and great casting. Linda Blair pulled off a good child performance, along with Ellen Burstyn who had probably the best performance in the whole movie. This movie had exceptionally creepy imagery that helped create a dark and gritty atmosphere. The reincorporation of helplessness the characters feel is very immersive and that well-written dialogue I mentioned helps drive that feeling home. I get the sense that William Friedkin had intentionally made it where the consequences for the character's choices were unpredictable, therefore inputting a sense of tension with every motivation. My only complaint with this film is that the character of Regan seemed a bit too innocent to be entirely believable. She seemed to have the personality of a 10 year-old instead of a 13 year-old before she gets possessed.  I'll be watching this again very soon, it was very impressive. 9/10"
TrueFilm,3altsy,EeZB8a,4,Sun Jun 21 19:42:30 2015 UTC,"This week I watched Whiplash (2014), Reservoir Dogs (1992), The General (1926), and 8½ (1963).   Whiplash was a heck of a thing.  I'd seen it once before.  Love the pacing, the acting, and the ideologically problematic (or, at least, quite provocative) yet undeniably exhilarating ending.  I don't know how to hide spoilers, so if you want to discuss the ending further, let me know how, and I can do that!  But anyway, it's a great film, very fast-paced, sometimes over-the-top while still being grounded in real, relevant issues re: educational pressure, emotional abuse, etc.  And I loved the music, of course. Reservoir Dogs was interesting.  I love how it's a sort of convoluted way to tell a simple story - or at least, a story that would have sounded ""simple"" if, say, a news station had covered it.  ""There was an attempted diamond heist, and a shootout,"" etc.  Not much to it.  But the way the film tells us the story reveals so many intriguing side-plots and backstories and details.  I like that.  I'd seen the film once before also.  Made me think about violence and desensitization.  Made me wonder if I should contemplate the moral implications of my total lack of shock during the torture scene.  The first time, it was sickening - this time, it was expected.  Still harsh, but it didn't affect me.  And I wonder if that's a bad thing.  Tarantino films in general make me think about that a lot. The General is impressive.  Buster Keaton has a train thrown off a burning bridge!  That's crazy.  The action set-pieces and physical stunts reminded me of Jackie Chan, which I realize a lot of people say, so I'm not being original or anything.  I'm late to the game - I hadn't seen any Keaton until this week.  I was not disappointed. 8½ was my first Fellini film.  I need to read more about it to finish forming my thoughts.  I don't understand the ending.  I loved the beginning - those first shots of the cars and everything, really mesmerizing, really great way to get my attention.  I loved the theme of fact and fiction mixing together, sometimes maybe inadvertently.  I loved the black and white cinematography.  The girl I watched it with mentioned another cool thing:  the lighting and composition is drastically different in shots that feature Claudia Cardinale; she's given more of an aura, per se, than the other actresses.  The protagonist loves her and so does the camera.  I thought that was cool.  I need to read more about 8½ to see how much of this movie-about-a-movie mirrors Fellini's actual life.  Oh, one more thing -- the film reminded me of the more recent Birdman.  At least in the sense that both are about a storyteller mixing his life with his fiction, and both are about how that fiction falls apart (and, likewise, so does life).   Tonight I am having some people over to watch Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964).  I've never seen it.  I'm excited.  EDIT:  formatting"
TrueFilm,3altsy,calcio1,5,Sun Jun 21 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"Limelight (1952)- Dir. Charlie Chaplin Wonderful film. I didn't find it as refined as some of Chaplin's early works but it's magical and very moving. Easily and obviously his most personal film. There's tons of autobiographical details about Chaplin himself in this film and it was wonderful to see Buster Keaton on screen with him. A very sad tribute by an icon to himself and the art he loved. I really enjoyed it. Chaplin doesn't move as freely here, nor does he have as much whimsy as his other works which was pretty sad, but it gave the film a great deal of charm of poignancy. Really loved it.  Love and Mercy (2015)- Dir. Bill Pohlad Could not believe this was a directorial debut. The film is so fresh and confident and full of energy. The performances are very strong, namely by Paul Dano and John Cusack. Really captured the psyche of Brian Wilson very well I thought.  Inside Out (2015)-  Dir. Pete Docter- Easily one of Pixar's best films. Very layered and deeply moving film. One of my favorite concepts discussed was that too much joy and optimism could be a negative thing. I loved the tackling of Riley's loss of innocence. One of the interesting thing's about the film is that it seems to be a stark anti-thesis to ""Tomorrowland"". Tomorrowland preaches (and hits you over the head) with relentless optimism whereas ""Inside Out"" seems to be suggesting that it is okay to be sad and that life will only get harder as you get older. It's a remarkable film and I'm not sure if children will fully grasp it's importance.  Pather Pachali (1955) Dir. Satyajit Ray The Apu trilogy is in town (looking forward to seeing the next installment tonight) and I finally had a chance to see it. The restoration is glorious. This was my first time seeing the film but it looks truly stunning. I'm still not sure how to approach this film. It is life, pure and simple. I loved the stunning simple realism Ray uses to approach his subjects. The storm sequence was breathtaking . I didn't know when the film was supposed to be shot so the reveal of the power-lines was pretty exciting to experience. It also feels like two different generations meeting for the first time. It's fascinating to think of how two vastly different cultures can exist so close to each other. The power-lines made me consider the simple, improvised, agricultural lifestyle of Apu and his village living near a modern industrial city. I can't wait to see what's next (especially considering how the first one wraps up)."
TrueFilm,3altsy,TrumanB-12,3,Sun Jun 21 20:25:17 2015 UTC,"Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter (2014), directed by David Zellner  ★★★★★   One of the shorts in the 2009 film Tokyo!, has to do with a young recluse, or hikikomori - a type of social withdrawl. You get a sense of this with Kumiko, except she does this in her mind, and she still has no fear of the outside world and ventures out with abandon. The cinematography here is totally unexpected. A few scenes stand out - one of the opening shots of the ocean and a wave cloud passes in front of the sun from the right, and the last long take shot during the credits when she's walking away and disappears into a speck, then nothing but white..  God Help the Girl (2014), directed by Stuart Murdoch ★★★★★   I have to admit - I loved Gregory's Girl (1981), which is not a musical - and both are set in Scotland. From the opening scene, you know that GHtG is a musical! After seeing GHtG on a top 10 list, I added it to my Netflix queue and it hovered near the top, getting preempted again and again. Then I forgot about it and it queue up without my knowing it, watched it, and was hooked.  Pacific Rim (2013), directed by Guillermo del Toro  ★★   Just shy of rounding up to 3 stars. There's just too much going on to follow the action. I first thought that a theater viewing would fill in the gaps, but now I'm not so certain. I would rate this as about even with Godzilla 2014, and I didn't like that one too much either.  Monsoon Wedding (2001), directed by Mira Nair  ★★★★   Such a fun film, and you start to wonder about the title with all of the good weather leading up to where you're taken. Great character development, you start to follow then through this large reunion of sorts. I started having reservations about it as soon as I put the disc in and hit play, wondering if it was a bollywood musical or if I'd make it through - but I needn't have worried.  A Generation (1955), directed by Andrzej Wajda  ★★★★   I have the three film Criterion set from the library, three war films by Andrzej Wajda. From the slow circular opening shot that introduces you to the ghetto, you know you are in for a different ride. And the way he handles a simple shooting in a bar, with the body jumping with each bullet, and the PTS scream in the aftermath in the tunnel. I can't wait to see the next two."

TrueFilm,3altsy,cattymills,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:22:22 2015 UTC,"^ I agree.  I think it was Ashes and Diamonds, where there was an unusual shot, for me anyway. It was during the set up of the banquet. In the background was a guy on a ladder, and he's at the top of this ladder and starts walking it - sideways. Later, you can just see him walking it ""forward""!"
TrueFilm,3altsy,lordhadri,3,Mon Jun 22 22:29:15 2015 UTC,"Hud (1963)  Decent Paul Newman movie about a loathsome character who coasts by on his charm and good looks, and the generation / culture clash between him and his paw on their ranch. Beautiful black-and-white cinematography from legendary James Wong Howe, terrific performance from Newman. Evidently contemporary audiences felt he was the hero, despite being an utter shite. Testament to his charisma. Solid but not amazing 7/10  The Great Escape (1963)  Can't beat a good prison escape movie. This is a Christmas classic in the UK for some reason, but I don't know if I've ever watched it from start to finish. A Hollywood classic that's impossible not to like really. Amazing when you consider it portrayed events less than 20 years in the past - like a movie about the 90s now. And the contrast between Elmer Bernstein's legendary earworm of a score and his ultra-minimalist, handful-of-guitar-strums soundtrack for Hud was certainly highlighted by seeing them back to back. While watching I wondered when the last decent contemporary escape movie was made? Is it just too hard now with CCTV etc. I guess Prison Break might be an equivalent, but I've not seen it. 8/10  Il Gattopardo (The Leopard, 1963)  Italian epic by Luchino Visconti based on famous historical novel was panned at the time but I thought it was terrific. Burt Lancaster as the eponymous nobleman during the unification of Italy, who realises his caste's time is coming to an end; Alain Delon terrific as his do-anything-to-get-ahead nephew and the stunning Claudia Cardinale as his rich-but-common-as-muck love interest. Beautiful Technicolor widescreen photography, and a very interesting look at a historical period I knew next to nothing about. 8/10  Jurassic Park (1993)   Stuck this on in advance of the sequel. What can you say that's not been said? Spielberg at his best. I'd never really noticed before how Goldblum has almost nothing to do for the second half of the movie. 8/10  Jurassic World (2015)  Watching the two back-to-back you see what's missing in the sequel, characters you give a shit about. Enjoyable but braindead rollercoaster fun, some good dino action but so much is utterly ridiculous, not least the final fight. 6/10  Conan the Barbarian (1982)  Probably caught bits of this on TV as a kid but never the whole thing. Practically a silent movie, there's so little dialogue, but given that the three main actors are a bodybuilder, surfer and dancer, that's probably for the best. Cracking score from Basil Poledoris and some top production design. Fun times but the cheese factor is occasionally overwhelming. 7/10"
TrueFilm,3altsy,cattymills,4,Mon Jun 22 03:11:47 2015 UTC,"The Sixth Sense(M Night Shyamalan)  A child psychologist (Bruce Willis) is asked to help a small boy who claims he can see dead people. It's a pretty nice idea for a plot, and it's got quite a few themes and interesting story choices in there. Other than that, the best thing about the movie is the acting. Willis delivers a heartfelt and very real performance and goes extremely well with the impressive child actor who is able to surprisingly convey all the right emotions and deliver lines in exactly the right tone needed. My praise stops there. What we have otherwise is one of the most overrated movies in recent history. Before anyone asks, I avoided spoilers for this movie like the plague and never guessed the twist ending. My fault lies with how the move attempts to do so much, yet is never able to. It fails as an emotional drama surrounding a damaged boy, it fails as a suspense thriller meant to keep you on edge from paranormal stuff, and it fails as a mystery where problems are slowly unravelled step by step. There are many paths this movie could have taken, sadly it sort of went half way along all of them and then turned back and chose another. Because of this it never feels like it has accomplished anything. Storylines feel a bit rushed and there are few intriguing directorial choices regarding scenes. Visually there is some good slow camerawork that weaves around environments or captures very large shots, but it's nothing outstanding. Sets are uninspired and the movie lacks any sort of colour palette. The score is the worst though. 1999 is still very recent, but this feels like stock from the average detective series at the time. Just like the story, it's unable to hit any of the right keys and feels plain. As a result of all this I was unable to be fully invested in the movie. It's still well made and a good movie so to speak, but it's too indecisive and doesn't have qualities that makes it stand out over other movies in its genres.   7.3/10  +1 (Dennis Iliadis)  At an exuberant party, a couple teenagers mysteriously notice their doubles walking around repeating the same actions they did minutes ago, getting closer and closer to them. +1 feels like a B-Movie trying to be smart. It is correct in that it has a neat concept with a lot of potential, and that's where it plays to its strengths. Without a doubt, +1s most powerful suit is its unpredictability. I never knew what would happen next and there were some scenes where the director actually went down clever routes and made me smile. I never knew what would happen next, and for that reason I had a good time watching this. On a technical level, it varies from bad to okay. Once you've seen it once, there is little point to go back unless you're with some friends and you want something mildly intriguing that you can talk around. The screenplay is the biggest offender. There was about one interesting character in the entire movie as everyone else doesn't belong there. You have a guy trying to get back with a girl, and another guy trying to get off with some other girl. The latter sets for record for highest amount of pointless comic relief scenes while the former causes the movie to become driven by a romance that drags on for far too long. Doesn't help that none of the actors are very good. Rhys Wakefield (that blond kid from the Purge that looks like discount Chris Hemsworth) is boring as all seven hells. I thought at least the actors could bring something to their underwritten characters to distinguish them. Not the case here. On a visual level, the movie isn't great either. Too many close ups and odd movements that serve little to no purpose except lengthen screen time by having us look at nothing. At least the score was interesting. The composer had quite a few tracks that created tension and mood all by themselves. He carried many scenes that Wakefield failed to. It's a fun Friday night with friends sort of movie, but there's nothing great here. I hope the composer finds work elsewhere.   5.9/10  Don Jon (Joseph Gordon Levitt)  This passion project is the antithesis to chick flicks. JGL directed, wrote and stars in this romantic comedy. He plays an average guy who loves working out, going to church, picking up women, and watching A LOT of porn. One day he meets a girl (Scarlett Johansson) with whom he seeks to develop a deeper relationship. To do that however he must subdue many of his urges and rituals, instead listening to her and watching her own chick flicks. This is a humorous yet endearing look at how men and women view relationships, and from my experience, it's spot on. Don Jon is fast paced and very energetic with snappy editing choices and brilliant performances that really bring out characters personalities. The best component however is the script. It's hilarious to say the least and rings so close to home for me. Even the PD did a great job with the very masculine interior designs. Without a doubt one of the best romcoms I've ever seen.   8.7/10  Back to the Future (Robert Zemeckis)  It took me a long time to come around to this, and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. After a maverick scientist creates a car that can travel back in time, he is killed by a group of armed terrorists and his teenage friend escapes with his life only by transporting himself 30 years back. Since this is a classic I won't dwell too long on it. It's creative and original, with great humour and performances from everyone. Scenes are very varied and it's extremely well paced. Just a must see for any film lover.  8.9/10  The Sting (George Roy Hill)  Released in 1973 and starring Robert Redford and Paul Newman, this movie snagged 7 Oscars for itself, and rightfully so. Set in the 30s USA, a band of criminals plan to con a wealthy businessman for an enormous sum of money as a revenge plot. It's less of a heist movie and more of a crime drama, but it's incredibly unique and stands out as one of the best in its genre. The plot itself is more extravagant than many other similar movies and every bit of dialogue is very witty and incredibly real. Every single actor is at the top of their game and as a result the movie is full of character and flair. The editing is flawless and outside of a few hiccups in the first 20 20 or so minutes, each scene is exactly as long and rich as it should be. Not only is it brilliantly written, but it looks and sounds gorgeous as well. The classic piano score is lighthearted and upbeat, keeping a consistent tone, and the PD really went the extra mile with creating one of the most authentic depictions of 30s USA I have ever seen. It's stylish and colourful and never tiring. This is a must watch.  9.4/10"
TrueFilm,3altsy,lordhadri,4,Mon Jun 22 12:39:46 2015 UTC,"Synecdoche, New York (Charlie Kaufman)  I loved Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and I was curious to see what Kaufman can do it the directors chair. Suffice to say this is even better than the movies where he serves solely as a writer. Phillip Seymour Hoffman stars an unstable playwright who after receiving a huge sum of funding, decided to create the largest play ever seen inside of an abandoned warehouse. He means to explore life and death in a piece that is based step for step on his own life, casting actors as people in his own life. It's a play inside of a play inside of a movie, and some claim it goes even further than that. I will say it here, this movie is perfect. I do not understand how it missed the Oscars. Any single actor/actress could've gotten an Oscar for their performances and PSH is so good he should get two just for the sake of it. Every moment is so deliberate and carries tonnes of weight to it. Emotional and riveting, all characters are bottomless in their depth. This is a movie about oneself. Everyone can find a piece of Me Myself or I in here. And that's what's so beautiful about it. Never mind the sombre, slow score. Forget the dreary grey, industrial aesthetic. Don't think of how purposeful every frame of the movie is. The best is how this can be interpreted in any way you want. On a 20mil budget, Kaufman had crafted a modern epic that outshines almost all other movies in its scale. It's funny, sad, angry, melancholy and awesome all at the same time. This is one of the best movies ever created and if you have the patience and don't mind a story that requires a lot of thought, go for it.  After viewing the movie I recommend checking this analysis out: https://youtu.be/rjqYpsuBrPU  This is the 5th movie I've given a perfect score to.  10/10  Ed Wood (Tim Burton)  I'm not often fond of biopics, but this is one I can get behind. Johnny Depp plays the childish, enthusiastic Ed Wood, infamous for being mid 20th century Z-list director behind such works as Plan 9 From Outer Space. Shot in black and white, we get to follow the beginnings of Ed Wood's career, accompanying him through his private and professional life. Often we get to see the behind the scenes of his movies and how they even managed to come to fruition. Ed Wood is someone I have to admire despite making some of the biggest crap in movie history. He never made a decent film, but what separates him from Uwe Boll, is the fact he LOVED his job. Always looking up to Orson Wells, he worked tirelessly to make his artworks and was a good person. Johnny Depp is full of youthful energy here and the supporting cast are all fantastic too. You empathise with everyone and feel for them. Despite its comedic tone, the movie is actually quite sad. Knowing that Ed Wood never made something of worth, yet seeing his joyous smile on set everyday, is so heartfelt. The photography here is excellent as well and the BW choice was well suited. Costumes and makeup so period accurate and the movie itself looks like it could've been made decades prior. Unlike the Artist however, this does feel like an original story and not Oscar bait. It's cheerful and happy and probably Burtons best work to date.  9.0/10"
TrueFilm,3altsy,cattymills,7,Mon Jun 22 12:40:35 2015 UTC,"Kicking and Screaming (1995) directed by Noah Baumbach  A bit like Slacker, I initially found this hard to get into. The wit did nothing for me. In fact, that the dialogue basically consisting of larger words strung together in none-too-clever ways paired with the privilege of the characters and the detours of the camera after long takes which felt more contrived and smirking than clever made me find this movie downright insufferable, though I'm sure a bit of jealousy on my part did not help with this. But, then something clicked and this became great. The long takes stopped feeling like attempts to be clever and instead just documented the world of the film, full of warm earth tones and well-realized, well-performed, and above all, sympathetic characters. In conjunction with Baumbach's insightful view this became a pretty formidable film just exuding nostalgia for things barely gone by, helplessness, aimlessness, and loneliness. Still wasn't funny, though.  ★★★★  Three Kings (1999) directed by David. O Russell  On one hand, David O'Russell clearly had good intentions in this film. It's evident from the start with the portrayal of the armed forces as unbridled, ignorant machismo, and makes clear the less-than-noble intentions and actions of the Americans in the Middle East. But, on the other hand, any kind of message is completely muddled by the rest of the film. While the film wants to indict the racism and hyper-masculinity of the soldiers it revels too much in it for it to effectively do so. Any expounding on America's shitty actions is mostly told through exposition, which lessens its impact, at best, or, at worst -- like when it's told by Saddam's soldiers -- makes it seem like mere justification. And the continued insistence on having the audience identify with the four American leads is incredibly problematic. It makes a film that should be about the people actually living in the Middle-East about Americans. It shows that it has no real interest on humanizing anyone who isn't an American beyond a superficial level and has no interest in actually criticizing Americans. Making all the shitty Americans faceless, military higher ups and ending on that happy note is a cop-out. It prevents any actual hard hitting criticism. The final message is essentially ""Americans are mostly good guys -- there are some shitty ones, yeah -- but the good ones win out in the end."" Which, considering how the Middle East is turning out, is pretty awful. Yeah, this film is well-made. The washed-out, stark photography paired with David O'Russell's twirling, imaginative presentation and ability to balance tones is striking -- but subtext matters in a film and does so tenfold when it's this volatile. And, ultimately, when your subtext basically amounts to a bunch of pseudo-liberal, self-congratulatory bullshit -- no amount of formalism is going to redeem it.  ★★   eXistenZ (1999) directed by David Cronenberg  The only film by David Cronenberg that I had seen before this was The Dead Zone, which quite literally put me to sleep. That was decidedly not the case with eXistenZ -- I started this absolutely exhausted and when it ended I was wide awake. It takes a little while for the film to find its legs, but once that happens it's riveting. The film's appropriation of video games isn't particularly compelling on a subtextual level, but works very well 'superficially.' Even though it's meant to be in some way a criticism of the genre's narrative stiffness, it also imbues in the film the sense of sheer inventiveness and unpredictability that can be so great about video games. Toss in Cronenberg's knack for imagery and the bizarrely erotic sexuality, and the film's compulsively watchable. I didn't find the whole reality vs. distorted perceptions of reality terribly interesting, so it kind of held the film back from achieving greatness -- though it does give rise to an astonishing reveal where all of Cronenberg's stylistic choices coalesce wonderfully. Ultimately, eXistenZ is a very good, as that example just showed, it's the kind of film who's weaknesses come with their strengths.  ★★★1/2  Big Trouble in Little China (1986) directed by John Carpenter  Big Trouble in Little China has an amazing attitude: crazy, imaginative, and cheesy with a great sense of humor that doesn't wink at itself mixed in with jovial camaraderie and good-natured imprudence. Unfortunately, the greatness of the attitude doesn't completely spread to entirety of the film. A lot of the film came across to me as blandly, unimaginatively presented in spite of and magnified by the inventiveness within the frames, and as such those sheer moments of glee, while certainly present, come a lot less than they should, and in their place I felt indifferent. But, with that said, with this film, it's the glee -- not the indifference -- that sticks with you.  ★★★"
TrueFilm,3altsy,clearncopius,2,Sun Jun 21 14:40:37 2015 UTC,"I also watched Three Kings to see what you meant about it. It does have that problem of othering the non-English speakers in a context that should be about them and instead we follow these greedy American yahoos. However, I liked the dilemmas the movie puts them in, and that it gives us a version of warfare that doesn't look like a video game and shows how the powerless suffer more than soldiers do. The Bush=Saddam stuff was a little much, not that it doesn't have some real-life context to it, but comes off as sophomoric anyway. And the rebels getting away with the gold is great satire about the role of money in this whole situation but otherwise doesn't tie off the story in a satisfying way. I really liked it though, maybe it can be my American Sniper."
TrueFilm,3altsy,clearncopius,2,Mon Jun 22 00:40:31 2015 UTC,"Formally, the film was really cleverly and uniquely made and the gold was a brilliant metaphor -- so I worry that I may not be giving the film enough credit for that. I did really like this film up until when the wife of the hostage in the bunker with the gold in it was shot in the head by one of Sadam's soldiers. 'Til then, the main guys were being put in interesting moral dilemmas, but I thought that stopped after Clooney jeopardized their safety and money in order to help the villagers. From then on to me it looked like they were portrayed as pretty much entirely heroic, and for me the film unraveled from there."
TrueFilm,3altsy,jumpstartation,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:48:25 2015 UTC,"Greedy as he is, he can't help himself at that point. So he goes from trying to get something out of a pointless war to finding an honorable to fight for and everyone else goes along with it; of course, that also escalates the situation into open combat and get other people hurt. So his valor ends up looking like as much of a flaw as greed.   When I was watching I could tell what that would feel like a misstep but I think it's to humanize the character and not to tell a story about people who are totally indifferent. It's kinda like when in Pain&Gain - not much of a liberal, humanistic movie - once the characters get rich from their extortion scheme and buy their sports cars and mansions they also get married or start teaching neighborhood kids to play basketball. I think maybe I like Russell more than some of the other directors who just like to be nasty to their characters because he balances that with little kindnesses and sentimental endings. After all they go through here it's not like I wanted to see them get rich."
TrueFilm,3altsy,lordhadri,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:50:23 2015 UTC,"I don't really think that a portrayal of Americans in the US should be humanistic to the degree that the movie was. Obviously that runs the risk of being just as facile as a completely positive portrayal of the situation would be, but I think the film could and should be a lot more critical while still retaining some nuance. I might be a bit too inflexible on this, though."
TrueFilm,3altsy,BlunderLikeARicochet,10,Mon Jun 22 21:54:01 2015 UTC,"Good Night, and Good Luck (2005), George Clooney- It’s always interesting to me to see figures usually on camera behind the camera. This was my first Clooney movie with him as a director, and I thought he did a nice job both on screen and off screen. Clearly, politics and history are passion subjects for Clooney, as they are topics in many of his films. So this film about TV icon Edward R. Murrow’s fight to bring down Senator’s McCarthy’s relentless war on communism fits perfectly. Rarely do these films stay historically accurate, however Good Night, and Good Luck does an exceptional job of staying true to the real story line by using real footage and actual quotes from Murrow. It is a slightly fictionalized take on real events. But Good Night, and Good Luck is more than just history. It shows the power of television. In the two scenes that bookend the film, Murrow is explaining how the general American is complacent and lazy, only desiring entertainment from television and nothing more. Yet the course of the movie shows how television has been used to create major change in society. That message was extremely relevant in 2005 when reality TV, dumb sitcoms and mindless television began to rule the air. This is as much of a movie about defending television as it is about teaching historical events. 8.5/10  Kung Fury (2015), David Sandberg- So this was supposed to be a parody of campy, stupid, over the top 1980’s action films. But what it ended up being was an appalling YouTube video that looked like it was written and filmed by thirteen year old boys. The entire point of the film is “Hey look how stupid these 1980’s action movies are” yet it misses everything great about those films. Where’s the cheesy practical effects? The crazy makeup? The outfits? It’s nothing but thirty minutes of CGI filled eye vomit. Maybe I would be able to look past some of these if Kung Fury did what parodies are supposed to do and was funny. But instead every line of dialogue was a cheesy one-liner that in no way shape or form could someone have laughed at. How this has any business being mentioned in film circles baffles me. I find completely and utterly idiotic. This is a garbage short and probably the worst thing I have watched this entire year. 1.5/10   Pleasantville (1998), Gary Ross- Is Tobey Maguire a good actor? I still haven’t decided. Anyway, Pleasantville is a pleasant little movie about two 90’s teens who are placed into a 50’s television show and begin to change the world with their modern thinking. It is a film that heavily goes against conformity and promotes individualism. There is also the overarching theme of feminism, as women are shown to be independent thinkers who don’t need men and pride themselves on their sexuality. Despite not a single minority actor in the whole film, the movie has large themes of equality that popped up towards the end of the movie. The most notable image is during the courthouse scene when the conformist section was black and white while the people seated on the balcony were bright and vibrantly colored. It looked like a scene ripped straight from To Kill a Mockingbird. Lastly, the movie is about history, and the transition from the conformist 50’s to the individualized 60’s. In terms of narrative, it starts out pretty cheesy and ends the same way, but in between is a solid coming of age story intertwined with the themes I just talked about. A good movie all together 7.5/10  Hot Girls Wanted (2015), Jill Bauer, Ronna Gradus- A really interesting documentary about a lifestyle that many don’t know the behind the scenes of. Hot Girls Wanted is about young porn-stars, and why they get into the business in the first place and the issues they face once they are in there. The goal of this film is not to defend nor condemn this porn actresses, but rather to humanize then. Pornstars are too often treated as sub-human object simply for their line of work, yet this film does a great job of bringing life and depth to people we regard with such little esteem. You get to see pornstars as regular girls who either see themselves with no future or simply have a lust for attention and fame. You see their families, their friends, their boyfriends, their life outside of the set. You also see the abuse they suffer during shoots and in the industry, and how depressed the majority of them are. It takes the girls’ side, but never supports doing porn. In fact it condemns the industry, but is still able to portray these girls as regular people who have made a humanly poor decision. A very interesting movie which succeeds in it’s goal. 8/10  The Aviator (2004), Martin Scorsese- If anyone is going to make a truly great biopic then leave it to Scorsese. He is able to capture director/aviator/psychopath Howard Hughes’ life into a surreal, demented, yet factual depiction of his life. First and foremost lets begin with perhaps Leonardo DiCaprio’s best on screen performance, rivaled only by, in my opinion, What’s Eating Gilbert Grape?. Hughes was such a multifaceted person that it is only fitting for an actor to play him who portrays a wide array of emotions in films. DiCaprio can go from calm and collected, to passionate to psychotic very easily, and perfectly captures Hughes’ OCD and paranoia. The story itself is one of a man who was built on destructive surroundings. He was raised to think he was special and pure, and sees everything around him as a corrupting force. Constantly living in his families shadow, Hughes aims to prove that he is his own person and not a byproduct of his parent’s wealth. He carries a chip on his shoulder and a blue collar attitude even though he is exactly the opposite. This is the basis for who Hughes’ entire character is: delusional. As the film progresses we see him spiral out of control and become a reclusive, psychotic man, then resurrect himself from the ashes and ultimately prevail. Yet, and the last scene is indicative of this, he still faces serious issues. In a great American dream story arch, Scorsese shows that while Hughes appears to have achieved the American dream, he is still the same unstable man he was before. The American Dream is a fallacy, and as Hughes stares muttering “The way of the future...” into the mirror end after end, the line looses its meaning and the viewer realizes that there is in fact no future to the dream. Really, a bleak ending, in my opinion. Side note: what was up with the color correction in this movie? All the greens were blue at first then changed and what even? 9/10  A Trip to the Moon (Le voyage dans la lune) (1902), Georges Méliés- It’s hard to find a movie that is 113 years old, but this masterpiece certainly outshines some of the recent films I watched this week. If you haven’t seen this film yet, its on Netflix (original and remastered in color) and only 15 minutes long so give it a watch. It’s a wonderful piece of art that follows several french scientists on their trip to the moon. They land and encounter moon people which they then take back to earth with them. In effect, the first ever science fiction film. It is put together very well using live action and what looks like cartoon to create a breathing picture. It’s visuals are iconic and spectacular, and it is a film that everyone should find time to see 10/10"
TrueFilm,3altsy,Hahaieatpoop,10,Sun Jun 21 14:20:04 2015 UTC,"Snow on tha Bluff (2011), Damon Russell- Is this movie real? It seems like a quasi documentary/fictional film but I honestly can’t imagine something like this actually happening and for them to get this on tape. For those who don’t know, Snow on tha Bluff follows real life career criminal Curtis Snow as he runs the Atlanta ghetto known as “the Bluff” using a camera he stole from college kids during a drug deal to document his every-day life in the hood. This takes gangster and crime films to the hyperreal. There are drive-bys, drugs, gangs, and police at every corner. I know some people have  described the film as having the best portrayal of the hood in film history. If that is true, Snow on tha Bluff is a tragic story about reality, poverty, and the consequences of revenge. The main character, Curtis Snow, begins to lash out at a rival gang and ultimately pays the price when that gang kills his baby-momma, and Curtis is left to take care of his son alone. There are some very powerful scenes, such as when Curtis is cutting cocaine in his kitchen while his baby son plays next to him, and Curtis speaking to the camera about how he would play in the same room while his dad and uncles cut crack when he was a child. Yet despite having Curtis Snow as it’s lifeblood, the film is also destroyed by him. Meaning, Snow is a degenerate and criminal who blatantly disregards human life and care of his child. The point of the film is to gain Snow some sympathy, as if he was born into an unfair situation, but in this it ultimately fails. What little sympathy he gets is for the affection he shows for his son, yet by the end of the film he does nothing to redeem himself. Whether this is real or not, Snow is not a person you want to like no matter how you slice it. 6/10  Ladrón que roba a ladrón (2007), Joe Menendez- This was quite an experience. Not because this was a good movie or anything, but because it was my first time watching a movie in Spanish with no subtitles. I’ve been studying the language and wanted to see if I could comprehend a full film relying only on my Spanish skills. Honestly, it was hard. Most of the information I gathered from the movie was based on context clues, and sometimes I got lost when it was two actors on a screen conversing by themselves. But I tried, and it was fun, and it was a success. The movie itself is just a very average heist film about robbers who try to rob a multi-millionaire selling false healthcare products. Thus the name of the film: “To Rob a Thief”. Very cliché. Very uninteresting. Maybe if I watched it with subtitles I would get it more. I’d give it a 10 just for my personal achievement, but the actual film isn’t good. 5/10  Jurassic World (2015), Colin Trevorrow- It has Chris Pratt. It has dinosaurs. What more could you ask for? What Jurassic World does best is this: action, suspense, special effects, dinosaurs, dinosaur’s killing people, dinosaur’s killing other dinosaurs, nostalgia and product placement. What it does worst is this: plot, dialogue, character development. But you don’t give a shit about those last three things right? Of course not! You came to see dinosaurs fighting other fucking dinosaurs. You came to see people riding on dinosaurs. You came to see Chris Pratt on a motorcycle ride with dinosaurs. You came to see a woman outrun a dinosaur in high heels. You came because this movie has fucking dinosaurs. A lot of fucking dinosaurs. And your wish was granted. Your welcome. Sincerely- Jurassic World.  6/10  Re-watches  42 (2013), Brian Helgeland- A great story, but you certainly wouldn’t say the same about the movie. It’s so cliché and so predictable. The dialogue is so hackneyed and bland, the direction is nothing interesting. The film thinks it is so much more important than it is. Acting is alright, but really this is just a weak biopic filled with the common artificiality that comes from trying too hard to make a great movie. 5.5/10  Film of the Week: I loved A Trip to the Moon, but it was a short so probably The Aviator"

TrueFilm,3altsy,goldmoogle,2,Sun Jun 21 16:54:57 2015 UTC,"re: The Aviator's color correction, from wikipedia:   For the first 52 minutes of the film, scenes appear in shades of only red and cyan blue; green objects are rendered as blue. This was done, according to Scorsese, to emulate the look of early bipack color films, in particular the Multicolor process, which Hughes himself owned, emulating the available technology of the era. Similarly, many of the scenes depicting events occurring after 1935 are treated to emulate the saturated appearance of three-strip Technicolor.   red+cyan definitely has a weird look to it, but it reproduces skin tones surprisingly well."
TrueFilm,3altsy,daydreamurr,3,Mon Jun 22 12:28:34 2015 UTC,"My Life Directed By Nicolas Winding Refn Directed by Liv Corfixen (2014)- I was excited about watching this documentary to see a look into how Only God Forgives was made. Instead it was a more personal look at Nicolas Winding Refn as not only a film maker, but as a family man. Even though the documentary is only 58 minutes,  I still enjoyed it and found it to be emotional, funny at times, and a great look at a film maker who is having trouble putting his ideas onto film.  Beginners Directed by Mike Mills (2011)- I watched this film because I saw it under the critically-acclaimed films on Netflix. I was taken by suprise by how much I loved the film. A couple of tears turned into me crying like a baby. Ewan Mcgregor and Christopher Plummer are absolutely phenomenal, givimg a realistic father and son relationship. There seemed to be inconsistincies at times with the tone, but doesn't hirt the film drastically.  Drive Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn (2011)- What has not been said about this movie already? I have seen it countless times, with each viewing becoming more powerful. Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Oscar Isaac, Albert Brooks, and Ron Perlman come together to create a gripping, emotional drama that could have been a simple heist film.  Inception Directed by Christopher Nolan (2010)- Another film I have seen countless times and love even more with each viewing. Inception goes to show that summer movies can challenge audiences while being thrilling and epic in scale. I found several of the performances to be absolutely fantastic, mainly Leo and Tom Hardy. But Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt sometimes become overshadowed by other's performances. But no one can deny how fantastic Inception truly is."

Really great movie."
TrueFilm,3altsy,Tallain,2,Sun Jun 21 18:29:37 2015 UTC,"The tale of Princess Kaguya (2013) (Isao Takahata) ★★★★   I think that this film is highly significant because unlike so many other anime films it makes a drastic change of visual style. Visually this film is insane, mixing traditional Japanese hand painted watercolor with hand drawn animation. One scene in particular blew me away (I wont give it away but lets say the princess exits a building quite dramatically) based on the pure power of the motion presented. However it's important when viewing art from the east to also consider the simple, understated and static elements of the film; The natural motion of the character's movements was far more lifelike than most animation being produced today. I also enjoyed the plot based of an extremely old Japanese folk tale. I found the characters to be funny, sympathetic and emotionally engaging. My only fault with the film was one scene which I found very irritating and seemed to be needlessly unoriginal in using material found in many other Ghibli films. In general though I belive that this film is both entertaining and artful 4.5/5  The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn (2011) (Steven Spielberg/ Peter Jackson)  (rewatch) ★★★★   I am a long time Tintin fan. I used to read Hergé's books when I was child and consider them to be very high quality. This being so I entered the cinema dubiously in 2011 expecting the voices in my head of the characters to be sodomized by Hollywood. I exited the film with great excitement and vigor. Spielberg had done it! he had actually successfully transferred Tintin onto the medium of film. Upon watching the film again this week I was stuck by the vividness of the characters, locations, music and humor. Hergé's books remind me of excellent adventure films, because the presentation of the plot and characters are incredibly cinematic. Hergé worked with the controlling nature of Hitchcock or Kubrick over his staff, overseeing as much of the process as he could. Tintin always seemed to me impossible to put on the screen because it was already story boarded. However Spielberg and Jackson cleverly selected many major elements from several Tintin books and merged it with their own vision. This was clearly the correct approach because otherwise lifelong fans would be seeing nothing new. Spielberg has pioneered a new way of filming motion capture animation with the creation of this film. Astutely finding a way to portray his style of camera framing and movement into the animated world. You might wonder why I listed Jackson as a director when he is officially recorded as a producer of the film, This is because he was intimately involved in many of the directorial nuances of the animation with his animation company Weta Digital. For me the high point of the film was a visually impressive series of match cuts which optically narrates a very memorable scene for many Tintin fans. The low point in my view was an uninteresting use cranes which did not hold my attention. The cast brings the characters to life and William's score is appealing in it's use of period instruments and it's reflective nature. Some critics have noted the excessive use of animated gimmicks and they required a more honest authentic feel, however I think that the film captures the essence of Hergé's work (adventure!) and accurately translates it for new and familiar audiences. I am impatiently awaiting the sequel.  4.5/5"
TrueFilm,3altsy,radii314,2,Tue Jun 23 21:53:08 2015 UTC,"I've been devouring films this week so I'll try to keep this compact  The Usual Suspects - This one really rides the line between neo noir and straight action film for me. The noir aspects really lie in the story telling but not its aesthetics and dialogue. Spacey didn't fail to deliver in his performance and definitely tied the whole thing together for me.  Fight Club - My first time seeing this and I'm not totally sure how I felt about it. The film is so dense in symbolism that my scholarly side loved it however that density also made it kind of hard to passively enjoy. I feel like the symbolism feels more evident than it actually is; it's so in your face that you think ""oh, this is clearly about this"" but the more you look into it, the more you realize you had taken too easily. Definitely needs a rewatch.  Blade Runner (Director's Cut) - This only made me want to watch the supposedly better Final Cut more than anything. I really enjoy the looks of Blade Runner, it's very visually appealing. However, I felt the pacing made it hard to stay attentive and I felt there was a pretty small amount of characterization/character development. This cut ultimately left me feeling it was quite half baked and I hope the final cut can change my mind.  Casablanca - This one was a rewatch; what can I say about Casablanca that hasn't been said before. I mostly watched it as a comfort film this time, so I could smile at those infinitely quotable one liners Rick delivers time and time again. Really just a marvelous movie.  Dreams - My first Bergman film. I've heard much about his films and this was definitely a good teaser for what's to come. Thematically, I felt it was a little light but it was strong as a whole. I have Wild Strawberries and Persona on my watchlist for this week and I am looking forward with great anticipation.  8 1/2 - I haven't truly heard much about this other than how greatly revered it is and that it's a dreamy film about films in the style of Sunset Blvd or Mulholland Dr. I really don't know what to say about it, it just left me really impressed. The dream sequences took a moment to get used to and the choppy narrative was entertaining to say the least. The characterization of Guido was probably one of my favorite parts of the movie. Although his emotional past is revealed to us and we see the kind of person he is, I feel as though there is some kind of distance between Guido and the audience- he retains a sort of eccentricity the whole film and I rather enjoy something about it.  I'm rather proud of my watches this week, I got a lot of things off of my to-watch list."

Set in in 60s era Greece this film seemed to be a throwback tribute thriller. I could easily see Hitchcock interested in adapting the novel if he were still around.  I thought this film created the aura  of  anxiety any good thriller does but with a situation  that was appropriate for the era  and setting. I enjoyed most of the shots and how it was filmed. The acting was good but I can see why this film may not have been  recieved favorably by critics or moviegoers.   •Hector and the meaning of Happiness (2014) -  This in my opinion is Simon Peggs best on screen performance. The story was a sweet on and at times kind of cheesy but I overall enjoyed it. There was bits of really clean animation and, of course, hilarious Pegg moments. This is different from his early slapstick comedies and more along the lines of ""Run Fatboy Run"".   •Gladiator (2000) - This has always been a favorite of mine and I revisited it after reading actor Oliver Reed passed due to heart attack before the film released and how the director was forced to kill of Proximo using CGI and a double. Something that looked obvious while looking for it. Anyways, the film is always a ride and a half. The action is of course great and Phoenix delivers as the villainous and blood thirsty Caesar driven mad by his new power and guilt. Easily my favorite performance.  •Nightcrawler (2014) - It's debut on Netflix made this an obvious rewatch. Gyllenhaal delivers yet another stunning performance as he speeds through the LA night in search of tomorrows news stories. For me his transformation into Lou Bloom is something of a mastering of his talents. We've seen him play disturbed in Donnie Darko but here he's deranged to the point to where you take a look at him and if you'd catch that awkwardly terrifying stare of his who knows what's going on. I think this is best performance followed closely by Prisoners."
TrueFilm,3altsy,radii314,3,Sun Jun 21 17:41:25 2015 UTC,"The Two Faces Of January was one of the most overlooked films of last year. I agree that it feels like a classic Hitchcock film, maybe that's why I endeared to it so much.   I must admit that I've never loved Gladiator. It does a great job of world building but the editing in the battle sequences is distractingly bad and the performances are either dull or over-the-top. I enjoy the movie, but don't think it's as good as it is regarded to be."

TrueFilm,3altsy,lordhadri,5,Mon Jun 22 02:46:37 2015 UTC,"As always, you can ask me for expanded thoughts.  Field of Dreams Phil Alden Robinson, 1989: So a nuclear family witnesses the miracle of dead baseball players playing games in their cornfield. I guess it’s trying to use movie stars and sports to create a secular American religious experience, apologize for the cynicism of the Nixon years, and argue for the appreciation of what we (meaning a well-to-do Kevin Costner) already have? I can see why some people like this but dang it, I have no idea what it all means.   A History of Violence David Cronenberg, 2005: I finally got to see this and, well...I didn’t hate it?  True Grit Henry Hathaway, 1969  Rewatch - True Grit Joel Coen&Ethan Coen, 2010  Rewatch - Psycho Alfred Hitchcock, 1960  Rewatch - The Magnificent Ambersons Orson Welles, 1942: Theatrical revival.   Rewatch - Blade Runner: The Final Cut Ridley Scott, 1982: Okay Reddit, we need to talk about this movie.   I didn’t like it the first time, but had no idea why, and got treated as stupid for it. Revisiting it now is strange because I want to point out the plenitude of reasons why it’s thoroughly defective filmmaking while also acknowledging how much is owed to it by science fiction movies and video games that I love: it did a large part in creating cyberpunk, however accidentally. But almost all of its imitators are better, including fucking Battlefield Earth.  Harrison Ford is irrelevant. Many of the other actors seem to be doing as much acting as they feel like. There’s no memorable dynamic between any of the characters. The editing is awful, because shots don’t follow each other in any logical or expressive way and because it feels like there’s a bunch of missing footage that would at least tell this story in a functional way even if it made the movie longer and more boring. The set design and effects are the best thing going for it but the movie relies way too much on showing the same things over and over. I also noticed that the movie relies on sound effects to create impact or emotion where the images fail to do so, but even those are uncreative and repetitive.   I could not care less whether Deckard is replicant or not. The movie does nothing to make me conclude that that’s possible. If it had been played like a plot twist that would have been annoying but might have resolved the robotic emptiness of the character, but when there’s no solution at all, that only provokes endless internet discussions that aren’t worth having. At best it’s a red herring to distract everyone from how dull the main story is.  Complicating matters, I viewed the Final Cut Blu-Ray on an HDTV that makes it look too good: removing the mask of grime from the film that lends it atmosphere, the models just look like models, the matte paintings lose their depth and motion looks unnatural. You can see every drop of rain in the rooftop scene. Out of curiosity we checked out the director’s cut on the same TV and it looks closer to what a 35mm presentation would have been like, with more depth and flicker.  Ridley Scott is an institution now and there’s some conventional wisdom going around that any time he could make another movie as ‘good’ as Blade Runner or Alien. In fact those movies were never great to begin with and were not fully embraced in their time for reasons that remain obvious today. If anything, Scott has improved as a filmmaker with practice, but without ever overcoming the storytelling issues he had right at the beginning.   Experiences like this make me wonder to what extent it’s possible for an old movie’s reputation to be a mass delusion and how much movies themselves are responsible for that, especially since this is no cult film, it’s on both Sight&Sound and the IMDb Top 250. I rewatched it with someone who fancied himself a fan of the movie, yet he almost immediately turned on it this time and ended up disliking it more than I did.   Whatever. A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ghost in the Shell are much better. Those movies understood that you have to sympathize with the androids from the start. Interstellar, which had a lot of similar issues, is also better.  No ultra-long movie this week because I watched Orange is the New Black instead. Ruby Rose amirite?"
TrueFilm,3alj21,renlauo,2,Sun Jun 21 11:40:28 2015 UTC,"I just watched it in 2 parts - and while it certainly switched tones 1/2 way through (and did have that scene where Darby does the bit from Rosemary's Baby) I don't quite get the interconnection between the movies.

TrueFilm,3akuou,DaTurbanator,16,Sun Jun 21 04:45:37 2015 UTC,"This is an extremely difficult question, but the ultimate answer is both.  It's impossible to come to a definitive statement for either and, quite frankly, I think it's hard to even really favor one side over the other.  On one hand, director's vision must play some role in determining how we examine a film; after all, if we were to accept a satire at face value, then it's possible for one to misconstrue the subtext to be an endorsement of the very thing the artist is trying to critique.  That being said, individual interpretation is paramount in any art form and I think to limit a work to one point of view is foolish, especially when some of the choices on the part of the filmmaker may not have been entirely conscious ones.  Part of what makes a great work, such as Bill Morrison's Light is Calling or Jiri Trnka's The Hand, great is that they leave enough ambiguity to allow for any number of interpretations to be valid.  Having one singular way of thinking or seeing something can be kinda boring sometimes.  In regards to your question involving if we should allow for the revisions of the artist, I really couldn't be bothered one way or the other.  They are equally valid, but I don't give a preference.  In that capacity, you aren't having a debate between interpretation vs. directorial intent, you're having a debate over which version of the film is preferable.  That's just a subjective argument, like the argument over subtitles versus dubbing.  Both are valid, it just comes down to a preference.  But I wouldn't say that's a matter of audience interpretation versus directorial vision."
TrueFilm,3akuou,afewthoughtsonfilm,4,Sun Jun 21 05:00:38 2015 UTC,"When it doubt its always better to have all possible versions available for comparison.  Its always important to see what was shown in theaters at the time for historical context, and fun to see what would've been possible at the time if the producer or whoever didn't interfere.  ""Updates"" like George Lucas's star wars, or Chaplin's sonorized versions of his silent films I'm less a fan of, but I'm fine with them existing as long as the original is available alongside.  What's trickier can be films made in the Soviet Union by directors like Tarkovsky and Parajanov where often the censorship process occurred while the film was being edited, so the ""original cuts"" of these films are often not the director's final cuts either, and you often have to choose between less censorship or better editing."
TrueFilm,3akuou,RyanSmallwood,7,Sun Jun 21 11:47:38 2015 UTC,"We have an interesting dilemma talking about modern arts. There is no criticism of the multiple versions of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel... only the one version. As art moves away from the physical, there can be many versions--even serially issued versions from the same artist. With film it seems possible to have an editor's version(s); cinematographer's version(s); director's version(s).  Something coming (from the gaming world) is a version of self-directing where a viewer selects a specific POV within a 3D space/story--and that is also a specific version. Just a guess... after that becomes commonplace, the director's versions will become again the defacto version. But, you know, that's 2040 talking. :)"

The producers sued Basinger and won, 8 million dollars. As near as I can tell, this is the largest breach of contract settlement against any actor, ever. Basinger declared bankruptcy and eventually paid 4 million bucks.  I haven't seen Boxing Helena before but I'll definitely check it out from your analysis! I saw her next movie;  surveillance; and though I can barely remember the plot; I distinctly remember loving it; and finding it quite unique. I think it came out a good 15 or so years after Helena, so I can only imagine that experience made it tough for her to get another project off the ground."
TrueFilm,3ajsgo,lazespud2,2,Sun Jun 21 08:12:58 2015 UTC,"I, too, felt that something interesting was going on beneath the blatant awfulness of some of the surface elements of this film. If nothing else, I thought Sherilyn Fenn was brilliant in it. Not sure I'd agree that gruesome surgical spectacles would have made for a more engaging viewing, though. I can't help thinking that infusing this twisted fairy tale with any serious effort to portray dismemberment realistically would have robbed it of what little artistic merit it does have. On the other hand, I can't say it's quite successful as a allegory, either. Chambers Lynch had some very interesting ideas when she made this, but at the tender age of 18, it seems she simply lacked the maturity to wave those ideas into a meaningful story."
TrueFilm,3ajsgo,hadrijana,3,Mon Jun 22 09:41:43 2015 UTC,"God, was she only 18-19 years old when she made this? I had no idea, I sort of admire the film a lot more knowing that! It is a very mature subject to approach at that age and the lack of any violent imagery and almost disenchanted attitude both characters have to the amputations reflects the age of the filmmaker for sure. I just read this quote from Chambers Lynch:  I would love to know why people were so mad at me for telling a crazy fairy tale. I'm the first to say I didn't know what I was doing. I did the best I could at 19, and all these crazy things happened. The idea that the film was faulted when everyone involved worked so fucking hard and believed in me, and there were these adults believing in me, who was essentially a child…  and it makes me feel sorry for her. But misinterpretation doesn't excuse the huge gaps in tone between the actors and the filmmaker or the laughably ""erotic"" sex scenes that are shot like 80's music videos."

That's why you shouldn't use imdb rankings as a measure of a film's ""greatness"".  As lordhadri mentioned, the cons of Interstellar have already been discussed countless times. So to answer your question: Yes, lots of people thought it was a bit silly.  However, I believe you are, by nitpicking the plot and realism, completely ignoring the pros of Interstellar such as the popular opinion that it was a fantastic movie-going experience watching it in theatres in IMAX. The pounding Zimmer soundtrack and spectacular visuals make for a highly enjoyable thrill ride. Going by the fact that you've avoided seeing Interstellar til now, I'll assume you watched it in the comforts of your home. If I am correct in my assumption, then I'd argue that you've missed out on a huge factor of the film's popularity."

Kip Thorne, and the scientific community as a whole, genuinely learned new things about black holes they hadn't known before as a result of creating that visualization (theoretical physicists don't often have a multi-million dollar budget to spend on visualizations, so they took advantage of it while they could).   Note that the more realistic images in the article you linked were also created as a part of this process. Interstellar created the most realistic image of a black hole ever produced, tweaked it better fit the screen (like everything in a movie, even the most accurate realism films), and then also created the most accurate image of a black hole ever put on the big screen."

I only saw it once in the theater, and while it had some impressive visuals it had enough flaws in the plot that I have no desire to see it again. So if people watching it at home are now more acutely aware of these flaws without the WOW factor to distract them then its overall rating will definitely drop over time."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Squonkster,11,Fri Jun 26 18:06:35 2015 UTC,"It's not that ""it only works in a theater"", it's about watching the film in the way it was meant to be watched. Taking a 70mm film like Interstellar and shoehorning it into a HDTV is basically equivalent to taking a 35mm film and shoehorning it into an iPhone.   Also I think with what you're saying, you're treading into the endlessly debatable territory of ""What is the purpose of film?"" If the main thing you seek from cinema is the narrative and a logical plot, (a dangerously narrow approach to the versatile medium IMO) then you'll find Interstellar lackluster. If you give the visuals, sound, and overall viewing experience more weight, then Interstellar can more adequately cater to your needs.   It's about what defines a ""great film"" for the subjective individual; ratings are high because many people define a great film as how enjoyable/memorable the theatrical experience is and no one has the right to tell them otherwise. The ratings slowly plummet as time goes on because of people (I was one of them) who choose to watch them in Bluray/DVD quality on their TV and pick apart ""plotholes"" and other insignificant flaws like vultures due to the lack of total immersion. It's not just the size of the screen, it's the level of attention given to the film that can affect one's opinion of it."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,qpzm333,7,Sat Jun 20 21:42:13 2015 UTC,"In my head I was comparing Interstellar to 2001 as an example of a film that can be both an astounding big-screen experience as well as thought-provoking. Both films are certainly seen to their best advantage in a cinema, but I feel that 2001 can also be appreciated in a different way at home, while Interstellar probably suffers in that venue.   I've only seen 2001 twice in a theater and many more times on a small screen. On the small screen, the fact that you aren't engulfed in the movie's sights and sounds can allow you to pick up on other nuances and meanings. Viewing Interstellar without that sense of being overwhelmed in the cinema might just make the flaws more obvious.  It could also just be down to my personal taste, but part of what I love about 2001 is that it doesn't hit you over the head with explanations for everything. Almost 40 years later people are still puzzling over and debating it, and I just don't see Interstellar having that same kind of longevity."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Squonkster,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:37:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's really true (that it only works in theatre).

TrueFilm,3ag57s,hrgilbert,17,Sat Jun 20 23:52:21 2015 UTC,"Spectacular visuals, my ass.   No offense, but aside from that shot of Saturn, the visuals weren't anything special. Cinematography-wise, it really failed to deliver on ideas and themes (as much of the depth of a movie comes from shots and framing), and a lot of the space stuff could have spent more time on, for example, expository shots of the ship's interior, showing a cramped, stuffy environment. But the ship's innards were never explored, thus, the audience isn't given a clear Idea (and furthermore, a tone) of the ship.   Nolan's not great at depth in camera work, which is why he's always met with criticism about his characters, as shots never reinforce them; they focus on action.  As far as mise-en-scene, most spaces felt ""there"", nothing remarkable. Most interior shots were bland, most exterior shots seemed expository. It's not a matter of rule of threes making a shot work, it's the depth inside the frame, and Nolan's work here seems more practical than experimental or insightful. Most places existed as setpieces, rather than areas that felt ""real"" (which is the same problem I had with Inception).   Anyway, I'm drunk writing this and spellchecker is badass, but objectively, the visuals weren't anything compared to, say, Gravity (which won a ton of awards for a reason, Cuaron knows how to frame shit)"

They had some really cool concepts that were gated behind a faux intellectual story with too much tacked on melodrama. I guess what I'm saying is Nolan doesn't trust his audience (or maybe this is a producer/studio issue) enough to let those ideas shine, and instead we get the ""pencil through the paper"" analogy of a wormhole."

TrueFilm,3ag57s,vee_lan_cleef,50,Sun Jun 21 04:51:06 2015 UTC,"Interstellar was never in 3D.   TV is a pretty decent size for a movie experience.   Did you have the lights off completely? Did you have your sound system cranked up enough to shake your room? Did you watch it with a crowd that collectively held their breath during some of the intense moments? I'm not the biggest fan of Interstellar but I assure you, you don't know what you've missed by watching it at home."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Regaez,31,Sat Jun 20 00:55:31 2015 UTC,"It's not just the volume either, but rather the extremely low-end bass that makes certain scenes so much better. I have some nice speakers, but no subwoofer at the moment, and it makes the movie so flat compared to how it sounded in the theater, and really low bass frequencies are sounds you can feel. It's really important for Interstellar."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,dccorona,16,Sat Jun 20 01:06:32 2015 UTC,"The part when the rocket took off from Earth was super immersive when I saw it in iMax. The rumbling of the rocket was so loud my chair was shaking, my entire vision was filled with the cinema screen - cut to outside the ship - SILENCE, the entire cinema held their breath. Cut back into the cockpit, chair starts shaking again, back outside, silence. It was an amazing experience.   Then there's the scene when they're attempting to dock the spinning ship... That visuals of that scene, coupled with the soundtrack, still give me goosebumps watching it.   Yes, the movie was not without its numerous flaws but boy did I enjoy experiencing it. It was one of the more immersive, awe inspiring films I've seen at the cinemas and, after having rewatched it twice since, no TV screen can compare to the sheer scope and magnitude of scale of seeing it in iMax for the first time."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,jbkjam,7,Sat Jun 20 01:27:10 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but you can't compare a ""pretty decent size"" TV to an IMAX screen, particularly if you're seeing it projected in actual 70mm film. You can't even compare one of those 110"" LCDs or a home theater projector to an IMAX screen...primarily because you just can't get the movie in a format that compares to the IMAX projection, be it 70mm or digital."

The movie doesn't translate to tv's nearly as well which is not going help in the long run as it can only be seen that way from now on.  You don't have to upvote but there wasn't a reason to downvote. Another ""true"" sub going the way of ignoring reddiquette when opinions doesn't match theirs."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Audchill,119,Sat Jun 20 13:54:41 2015 UTC,"everyone loves this movie   Statistically speaking, yes, but it was also widely considered a disappointment by critics and segments of film fandom. The drawbacks of the movie have been pretty well trodden here and elsewhere."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,PixelatorOfTime,43,Sat Jun 20 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"Given the director, cast and premise, this should have been a great movie. I wanted to see it in the theater but that couldn't happen because we had a baby at home so we waited for the Blu-Ray release -- and both my wife and I were bored out of our gourd with it.  It was like a boring science lecture wrapped in a schmaltzy Hallmark card. I was far more entertained and emotionally involved watching the rebooted Cosmos series.   My biggest problem was there was no sense of wonder to it, it was all so clinical. Here's mankind's last hope traveling the universe to save humanity but it appeared Nolan was more interested in the destinations rather than the journey. Watching ""2001,"" ""2010"", or ""Sunshine, "" for that matter, I got the sense of the vastness and awe of space, but it was completely missing from this film, and I was crushingly disappointing.   Nolan is a great director and he's made some great films, but I've always gotten the sense from his films that he and his brother are trying too hard to prove their the smartest guys in the room. It worked masterfully with ""Memento,"" ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception"" but he missed his moonshot with ""Interstellar"" -- completely."

And while I know the visuals certainly shouldn't be the only criteria for a film's quality, anyone who didn't see it in its intended format is bound to have missed some of that feeling of awe and wonder. I haven't seen it again since theaters, yet I can vividly recall that feeling at the drop of a hat."

TrueFilm,3ag57s,lordhadri,5,Sat Jun 20 05:59:20 2015 UTC,On letterboxd I gave it about a 4/5 because I saw it in IMAX. It was stunning. And I did enjoy Nolan going to back to one of his main themes of the unforgiving nature of time and finding a way for his characters to sort of beat it. And most of the actors were top notch. To me that made up for some of the schmaltz and undercooked story elements.
TrueFilm,3ag57s,lordhadri,-5,Sat Jun 20 22:18:11 2015 UTC,Folks often say 'stunning' like that's a good thing. Sparing moments of pure cinema to shut your mind and senses down is not a substitute for proper dialogue with the audience.

TrueFilm,3ag57s,mutoeien,8,Sun Jun 21 18:34:16 2015 UTC,Totally agree. The biggest screens imaginable could never hide the fact that the visuals are universally empty in any format.  And I saw it in IMAX twice!
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Audchill,16,Sat Jun 20 12:59:15 2015 UTC,"for that matter, I got the sense of the vastness and awe of space, but it was completely missing from this film,   I really wish there was more subplot to the guy they left on the ship for 20+ years, that whole scene was just a quick, ""look at how old he is! move along now"" snippet."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,henrythebrown,16,Sat Jun 20 15:43:55 2015 UTC,That was one of the most hard-to-swallow developments for me. Both my wife and I agreed that someone alone for 23 years (I think it was) in a spaceship would have gone completely insane or committed suicide. I did appreciate how it demonstrated the theory of relativity in a very real way.
TrueFilm,3ag57s,5150RED,5,Sat Jun 20 14:00:47 2015 UTC,"I think that's one of my main issues with the film, is any time there's anything with potential or emotion, the film goes ""move along now"". The film never stops to actually go into anything. For a film about traveling though the large empty vacuums of space, it show goes fast."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,oljackson99,14,Sat Jun 20 15:36:52 2015 UTC,"I actually felt it did a fair amount of creating that sense of wonder you did not observe.  As one who has briefly studied the science that was discussed in the movie, I was awestruck with some of the concepts examined (particularly because this never happens in a movie).  That said, if I didn't have that background, I can see how it would have appeared clinical.  I do think the narrative that explained Cooper's realization about love was silly. It could have been omitted, and left to the audience to figure out."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,5150RED,6,Sun Jun 21 08:23:08 2015 UTC,"""I was awestruck with some of the concepts examined"". Like when they poke a pencil through a piece of paper? A scene that wasn't even original (done prior in Event Horizon).   I know that's just one example but I really didn't feel the concepts were particularly mesmerizing. My brother is an Oxford physics grad and he said the way the concepts were explored were dull as dishwater in his opinion. I shared the sentiment for the most part."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Is_It_A_Throwaway,3,Sat Jun 20 07:21:35 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  My ""awe"" was more from from my own wonderings, but the film's discussion was enough to get me thinking.  EDIT: It is a bit unfair to look at how your brother perceived the science in the film, though.  He has more experience - and has probably seen/studied even more fascinating things (probably with quantum physics rather than the relativistic physics in the film) - with the subject than the general audience and people like myself."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Squonkster,5,Sat Jun 20 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, and this is the exact problem I had with the movie. I absolutely ended up hating it because Nolan himself and the whole marketing was about HOW ACCURATE IT WAS, LIKE OH MY GOD LEVELS OF ACCURATE... Then they go into a wormhole created by humans of the future where there's a giant library. It was marketed as something it wasn't even trying to be. I fucking love science fiction, don't get me wrong, but if you tell me this movie is about something, it's not wierd I expect it to be that."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Is_It_A_Throwaway,6,Sat Jun 20 19:09:38 2015 UTC,"I also feel like the Nolans treated the audience like fools. Not only did they have to explain scientific concepts in a dumbed-down fashion but they also made sure to whisk away every little bit of mystery with that ending.   And the Matt Damon subplot seems like the most egregious example of talking down to the audience. It's like they assumed the audience would be getting antsy at this point with all of this science-fictiony talk of wormholes and time dilation and decided to ""ground"" the film by tossing in a good old-fashioned tired-as-shit serial killer storyline."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,kekekefear,7,Sat Jun 20 16:29:57 2015 UTC,"An even better example to me is when they land on the water planet. There are mountains in the horizon and suddenly they realize it's gigantic waves and that they are going to kill them. Shot of McConaughey realizing what they are, crecendo of music. He tells to fucking no one ""Those are not mountains... They are WAVES!"", and then he tells everyone to get back on the ship.  That's a great example of how Nolan works and why I don't find him so clever as most fans like to make him. He ruined an incredible oportunity for surprise with completely pointless exposition, since literally three seconds later (if you were slow not to realize it before they showed you) you see the goddamn waves and you realize why they were in such a hurry. I read somewhere else on the thread that Nolan takes the fun out of his movies, and while I don't particularly agree, maybe because that's not something I look for in movies, this is also a great example of that. He's so insecure on leaving the viewer literally a couple of seconds without an explanation of what's happening that his movies become numb, or at the very, very least, he ruined that moment."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,scolbert08,2,Sat Jun 20 21:35:39 2015 UTC,"also feel like the Nolans treated the audience like fools.   Nolan says otherwise, but i agree with you. He threat people as fools and probably right, there is no way this big budget movie can be understanded by general audience."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,dccorona,2,Sat Jun 20 23:05:57 2015 UTC,"The purpose of the pencil-through-the-paper scene wasn't to explain how wormholes work, but to explain why a wormhole entrance would appear spherical."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,D1r3ctor,13,Tue Jun 23 18:39:04 2015 UTC,I think there was a lot of sense of wonder. Their presentation of a black hole was so accurate that Kip Thorne went on to write a paper about what they learned about black holes by creating the digital one for the movie. That was honestly one of the most wondrous sights I've ever seen in a movie.

TrueFilm,3ag57s,hrgilbert,5,Sat Jun 20 13:45:02 2015 UTC,"They were somewhat liberal with how close they allowed the ship to get, but it is possible to orbit a black hole from the proper distance.   As for the point where Cooper actually enters the black hole, that one was completely unrealistic, yes. It was a very cool moment visually and as far as suspense is concerned, but I do find myself wishing they'd written their climax differently so they could avoid that particular bit. While it's true we really have no idea what happens after the event horizon of a black hole, it's a pretty safe bet that whatever it is, you'd be torn to shreds long before you reached it."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,AfraidOfTechnology,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:42:05 2015 UTC,"The event horizon (point of no return) and the point in which spaghettification would occur could, theoretically, be very far apart. This is especially true for exceptionally large black-holes (like the one in the film). Consider:   The traveling object, however, experiences no strange effects and does, in fact, pass through the horizon in a finite amount of proper time. From here to the central singularity will take 0.0001 seconds in proper time, in free fall, for a 30 solar mass black hole. This infall time is proportional to the mass of the black hole.  A misconception concerning event horizons, especially black hole event horizons, is that they represent an immutable surface that destroys objects that approach them.  Observers crossing a black hole event horizon can calculate the moment they have crossed it, but will not actually see or feel anything special happen at that moment."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,djresponsible,179,Sun Jun 21 13:07:40 2015 UTC,"Alright, the first hour of this movie is totally pointless. Half-assed character development, arbitrary dialogue, lots of boring shit that hardly envelops you in the story at all. Boring camera-work, silly melodramatic Hollywood stuff going on.    I think you might be confusing ""character development"" with something else. Character development is not something that typically happens within the first hour of a film; it's the way a character grows and develops throughout the course of the film. Also, I don't think the first half of this film was pointless. It may not have been the sci-fi extravaganza some people wanted, but it was necessary in setting up for the rest of the film. It's in the first hour or so that the dire conditions on Earth are made plain to the viewer, and we need a little bit of time with Cooper and his family to see how important they are to him. They will be his chief motivation to leave Earth. Without the importance of his family he has no real motivation to trust NASA and risk taking on their mission. Ultimately, it's the love of his family that causes him to take that path. This lends a sense of urgency to the plot that builds throughout the rest of the film; the viewer is concerned for the success of the mission and the fate of the Earth, but what we want even more than that is to see Cooper reunited with his family. Not only this, but the ""Anomaly"" or Murphy's ghost are critical because that is how the film sort of segues into the second act. It also creates a sense of mystique that the viewer will continue to wonder about for the rest of the film, and finally it connects to the end of the film.   Then, we get to the real meat of the movie. Classic Jesus/The One story, where only this one farmer is able to save the world, blah blah. Wait, is this Armageddon? No, not as good yet.   I don't think Cooper was meant to be seen as ""The Chosen One."" Remember, Brand has already succeeded in sending several other astronauts through the wormhole, and he was preparing to send another team in. He's sort of like leftovers that are just about to go bad. Also, I think the situation is more like Brand seeing Cooper as a resource, not a savior; I don't imagine there being an abundance of experienced astronauts, especially during the apocalypse. It's also important to keep in mind that Brand was not being completely honest with Cooper. He was sort of tricking him and preying on his desire to save his family.   I know I should suspend disbelief, but a lot of the 'science' stuff was laughable at best, and why the hell is our main character being explained what a wormhole is right before going in? Wouldn't he already have a basic idea before risking his neck?   A lot of the ""Science stuff"" in the film was theoretical. The filmmakers worked closely with a notable physicist in an attempt to maintain scientific accuracy. While they may have strayed a bit at times, there is still a certain amount of integrity to what was displayed in the film. As for the wormhole, I would imagine that while most people are familiar with the general idea of what a wormhole might be, the fact that no one has ever seen one before might cause a bit of discussion.  Finally, I feel you're focusing too much on the twist ending, which was admittedly awkward and difficult to digest, but also fascinating and rather interesting in a way. At any rate, it served as an appropriate segue into the end of the film, and to Cooper and Murphy's extremely cathartic reconciliation which is, in my opinion, what really made the film shine.   I understand that the film is not perfect; I think it's a good film, maybe not a cinematic masterpiece, but it was thought provoking and touching in certain ways that most Sci-Fi films are not. In fact, the film, particularly the ending, was more emotionally charged than most Dramas I can think of. This post is not intended to be an attempt to change anyone's mind, rather I simply hoped to offer what little insight I might have into certain aspects of this film."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,BattleChimp,76,Tue Jun 23 20:22:29 2015 UTC,"This is spot on. The film is not silly -- it is superbly ambitious and falters in interesting ways. The deliberate first hour is perhaps the film's most pointed, setting up the loosely dystopian world and the few who are capable of carving a new path for humanity. The film suffers not from silliness so much as clunkiness in parts, particularly the tight-wrapped ending that is antithetical to the dizzying, long-form style of the film. Yet I find myself admiring the rare attempt at 21st century grandeur."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,BZenMojo,23,Sat Jun 20 03:53:25 2015 UTC,"""Love transcends dimensions"" is rather silly for a hard scifi movie no matter how it's contextualized."

TrueFilm,3ag57s,goinnowheremcfly,3,Sat Jun 20 19:48:42 2015 UTC,"They absolutely were not getting their ideas from science when constructing that narrative, no. Even so, this was one of the few things I liked about the movie. Take away the scientific/exploratory backdrop emphasized by the advertising so much and you're left with a story about some voyagers who have very little hope to cling to as they look for a better home and all they find is one hellish place after another. I think the movie could have delivered better on that idea. But I can't deny the despair they feel at times is real. The movie just overrides it by cutting back to Earth to much in the last hour."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,D1r3ctor,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:07:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I get why they kept cutting back, but it really drags the back half down. They could have accomplished that part of the story in other ways."

I like the way the filmmakers implemented a sort of documentary element by including the interviews, however, I felt that it might have been a better idea to use documentary footage to supplement the film. Interview people talking about Cooper after he returned and how he adjusted (or did not adjust) to his new life. But that is only my opinion, perhaps the subdued documentary element served another purpose and the filmmakers were satisfied with that."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,laughterwithans,3,Sun Jun 21 03:38:58 2015 UTC,I liked the documentary aspect until I found out they were using real interviews from people who had survived the Dust Bowl.  Then I'm not sure how I felt about it.  It didn't feel like exploitation but what they went through was a very real thing and while I liked this movie I'm not sure what it was doing warranted using their memories quite like that.  Especially since it was already drawing heavily on imagery from that time period.
TrueFilm,3ag57s,henrythebrown,29,Sat Jun 20 13:08:23 2015 UTC,"nothing silly at all about Matthew Mcconaughey floating around in a 5 dimensional representation of his daughter's bookshelf in the past talking to a disincorporate soda machine robot ""marine"" about love-gravity.  I didn't hate the movie, but a masterpiece it is not."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,AfraidOfTechnology,6,Sun Jun 21 20:41:42 2015 UTC,"While I agree with most of your points, I just want to argue that just because something that happens in a film actually happens (be it based of a true story, or in this case, the scientific accuracy) does not mean it justifies it's use in a film. The science may well be completely sound, does not mean it's execution can make it appear far fetched, silly or clunky. It definitely does not justify the characters doing tonnes of expansionary dialogue to let us the viewer understand the science. I personally don't care about the science if it gets in the way of characters, emotion and drama, and in this film it certainly did. The film needed to learn how to shut up and let me enjoy the moment."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,moreplastic,3,Sat Jun 20 19:41:01 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you about the dialog, but I also think that you're being a bit overly critical; the wordiness in the film is a lose-lose situation. Some viewers will be unsatisfied if there is too much dialog in such a visually striking movie. However, if they don't bother explaining things like the wormhole, then other viewers will complain that the film didn't make any sense. It's interesting to note that people already complain about the film not making sense, so I can see why the filmmakers might have decided to go out of their way to make certain things clear. At any rate, I think the filmmakers made excellent decisions on exactly when to ""shut up."" The visual splendor of having passed through the wormhole, the entire organ-toned betrayal by Mann, and Murphy and Cooper's reunion come to mind."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,AfraidOfTechnology,21,Sun Jun 21 08:31:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this well thought out explanation.  I felt like OP just didn't get it, but couldn't articulate why so well without watching the movie again."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,EnixDark,13,Sun Jun 21 16:26:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you, and that is the impression I took as well. Someone else pointed out that the fact that OP didn't see this film at the cinema dramatically reduced the effect and I agree with that. It's too bad it can no longer be viewed in a theater. I really feel Interstellar is just best when viewed on a massive projector with a big sound system, it really needs that. I wish there were a cinema that would show certain films like this once they've closed from time to time. There are certain films that I would gladly pay to see again on the Big Screen."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,moreplastic,5,Sat Jun 20 06:25:06 2015 UTC,"I missed seeing Gravity in IMAX 3D in NYC when it was first released (October-ish). I decided to hold out on seeing it on the small chance it'd be back, and they ended up doing a weekend showing of it (and a handful of other movies) the following June/July. It was absolutely worth the wait for the visuals. I really wish reshowing films was more common."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,MikeArrow,4,Sat Jun 20 13:14:44 2015 UTC,"I watched it on my 24 inch monitor from bed at an appropriate level and it still blew my mind.    I think OP say he is interested in space movies, but maybe he isn't actually interested in space.  As someone who thinks about the vastness and  the nature of the universe and multiple dimensions probably too often for my own good, this movie blew me away.  I get that it panders to people who aren't familiar with the concepts and I'm fine with that, maybe it keeps the movie from being top tier, but it doesn't make the amazing elements that it has any less amazing.  People suck the dick off of Donnie Darko even though Richard Kelly admits in the commentary that the movie doesn't actually tie itself up in a little bow, it more like deus ex machinas into an ending that makes sense with the rest of the story but there isn't really an explanation for how it works.  So it baffles me that someone would call the end of this movie a ""shamamalan twist"" of an ending.  I think those who are more familiar with the concepts presented would understand more of the theoretical options available as explanations and not just find it to be ""silly""..."

Even taking all the stuff that doesn't necessarily 'add up' because it's theoretical science and not hard fact, I still find the movie an overwrought, melodramatic Hollywood chore.  I guess I was disappointed because I've seen it done better in other films, with better cinematography and a more gripping narrative."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,JamesB312,12,Sun Jun 21 05:56:59 2015 UTC,"The first 30 minutes drag on quite a bit. Especially all that hokey 'ghost' stuff.  Scenes like the parent teacher interview really tested my limits with the film. We're told in exposition so much that could have been established visually so much more cleanly.  Once they get out to space the film improves a lot, but then runs headfirst into questions of plot/character logic which drag it down again."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,dccorona,36,Thu Jun 25 22:07:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the sci-fi stuff is pretty solid, minus frozen clouds and the finale, but the finale was always meant to be straight sci-fi and the clouds are a neat, albeit ludicrously unlikely phenomenon.   I'm pretty sure that, as far as Nolan movies go, this is one of the ones critics consider to have actual emotion and character.  As for the rest...I mean, yeah, sure. All arguable. Interstellar certainly wasn't universally loved. Everyone thought it was worth seeing, but that doesn't necessarily mean it had universal acclaim. I mean, there are pretty lengthy discussions insofar as the film's flaws."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Globalscree,9,Sat Jun 20 03:35:14 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that, as far as Nolan movies go, this is one of the ones critics consider to have actual emotion and character.   This was my problem with it, though. It tries to have all of this... and it comes across as Mr. Burns pretending to be a nice person by wearing a mustache and pronouncing his name backwards. It plays out like someone who doesn't know how to write emotionally engaging characters, trying to write emotionally engaging characters.  Honestly, as far as emotion and character go, I think Nolan has yet to top his Dark Knight trilogy. In that, you actually understand Bruce Wayne and his motivations. He has a personality, and you care about him. You also care about Alfred, Jim Gordon, and depending on who you ask, Harvey Dent (who is a fairly likeable and ultimately tragic character) and Rachel Dawes.  All of these characters have lives, things to live for... hopes and dreams and fears and flaws. They feel like real people (compared to Nolan's usual characters).  Maybe it's because he didn't actually conceptualise them himself. Perhaps Nolan's biggest flaw is that he's unable to conjure up his own emotional weight. He can't seem to create compelling original characters. Characters that don't have to spend the entire film telling you who they are (like Dom in Inception).  In The Dark Knight Trilogy, the characters just feel alive. They act, because they are. They're good characters. But was that Nolan, or the fact that he had a wealth of material to draw upon to create them?"
TrueFilm,3ag57s,QuirkyGroundhog,16,Fri Jun 19 23:50:57 2015 UTC,The scene where Cooper is sitting there basically watching his daughter grow up over the course of a few minutes worth of videos was absolutely heartbreaking.

You've got Kip Thorne, a prestigious physicist and academic working on the film who has been very open about which parts he considers plausible and which he doesn't, which ideas were abandoned for cinematic necessity and which got in. He wrote a book on the science of the film. He advocates for a solid percentage of it. I mean, fundamentally I'm going to trust him over a bunch of armchair physicists."

TrueFilm,3ag57s,SmartToaster,18,Sat Jun 20 09:03:58 2015 UTC,"Seriously? Sunshine? The ""lets light the sun on fire with a bomb so that it doesn't go out"" sunshine? I like that movie a lot, but that statement kind of discredits you opinion regarding scientific realism."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,FuzzyLoveRabbit,4,Sat Jun 20 09:11:09 2015 UTC,"As far as sci fi goes, especially around that time, it was one of the more accurate probably because they did have a scientific adviser on set most of the time.  On the DVD he actually does commentary and goes through all of what works and doesn't work.  I remember him noting the actual sun going out could kind of happen but a bomb wouldn't solve anything."

A junior in college is questioning this guy:   Kip Stephen Thorne (born June 1, 1940) is an American theoretical physicist, known for his contributions in gravitational physics and astrophysics. A longtime friend and colleague of Stephen Hawking and Carl Sagan, he was the Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) until 2009[2] and is one of the world's leading experts on the astrophysical implications of Einstein's general theory of relativity."

For a movie that sold itself as hard scifi, that replaced trailers with cast and crew interviews about how intense the science was, the amount of pure speculation and artistic license was jarring."

It's not like there was a whole lot of outright contradiction of facts that are known...just a lot of less likely but not impossible scenarios used in places where the scientific explanation doesn't really exist yet.
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Is_It_A_Throwaway,7,Sat Jun 20 14:13:33 2015 UTC,"Why begrudge them their artistic license at those points?

It's an incredibly ridiculous and biased thing to tell someone ""well you should like the movie anyway even if you saw it under a false premise"". Of course it will affect how you see the movie and of couse it will make you mad. I frickin' love science fiction, and if Interstellar had been marketed as such, I'd fucking loved it for sure, but I was expecting the opposite because from day 1 it was advertised as being oh so different, ""had science!"". Whose fault is it?"
TrueFilm,3ag57s,monarc,4,Sat Jun 20 14:30:11 2015 UTC,Appealing to the authority of Kip Thorne on any of the nonsense in the movie is a typical Nolan red herring. :/
TrueFilm,3ag57s,vee_lan_cleef,2,Sat Jun 20 16:39:57 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from; Kip Thorne's got some eccentric views. But I think raising his credentials is a perfectly apt way of rejecting casual eye-rolling dismissals of Interstellar's science as silly or ridiculous. I honestly think Interstellar's pretty good overall, much better than Gravity (or the horrifically preposterous Armageddon), though short of, say, Primer.   My big fear is that Hollywood hears these kind of complaints & decides to go back to the way things were: where movies have fake science because that feels more real than real science."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,HilariousMax,3,Sat Jun 20 14:33:54 2015 UTC,"You're totally right. This movie is especially irritating because it presents the science as so firm (although maybe I shouldn't be counting the real-world book... but I do!), when a lot of it is bogus. The tesseract messaging is total fiction, and the time dilation physics doesn't add up if that tiny shuttle can escape the gravity well with no additional fuel."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,100011101011,17,Sat Jun 20 16:30:46 2015 UTC,"I definitely found it disappointing for many of the commonly cited reasons, but to be perfectly honest it was still one of the greatest theater experiences I've ever had.  The sound editing was simply phenomenal and it amazes me people actually complained about not being able to quite hear one or two lines of dialogue. I can definitely see how the movie might be underwhelming at home, but in IMAX I was completely and totally immersed in it the entire time. When the rocket first took off it shook the entire theater in a way that made it feel like I was actually setting off on a journey across space.  To me, it was the perfect combination of action and sci-fi in a way that has never been done before.   Quite frankly, I just found it too beautiful to call 'boring'. I think it promised to be more philosophical than it actually was and people went into it with mismanaged expectations. It is a pretty run-of-the-mill Christopher Nolan film."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,behemuthm,6,Sat Jun 20 13:29:01 2015 UTC,"When asked about the movie I told every one of them:   It's a very pretty movie and the robotics (TARS and CASE) were a fairly cool idea.   That's about all the praise I have for the film. The first act where they explain why they need to get to space took too long. The son was a waste of development time. I don't even remember the son's name. I remember Murph, though. McConaughey yells it for entire minutes.  The whole ""love is greater"" angle just reiterated the notion that every film, no matter the context, needs a romance theme."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,EliteKill,4,Sat Jun 20 13:46:21 2015 UTC,"I always have the same four problems with Nolans films: first, the soundtrack is usually massively overbearing, and just pummels you. Second, while he is massively secretive about the plot of his films, the trailers usually spoil every major visual beat of the films ( Mad Max is a great example of trailers that managed to avoid this; i was really pleasantly surprised to see that sand tornado happen when it happened). Three, i find the layout and movement of his action scenes generally difficult to follow. I recently watched Dark Knight again and this is the first time I really understood what exactly happened and where everybody was in the tunnel chase. On fifth viewing, no less.  And most importantly: his films are less about a story and more about plot. You'll be watching and then there's a PLOT POINT and then there's a PLOT POINT and then this guy needs to go from A to B so THIS PLOT happens. And then you leave the theatre a little confused and everyone is like 'yeah his movies a intelligent bro, you should pay more attention, otherwise just go see Transformers lol'."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,dccorona,11,Sat Jun 20 15:30:45 2015 UTC,"I have some questions about a few things actually...   In a world where crops are dying off and the only thing growing is corn (and even that is dying) - how are people causally drinking beer every night? Shouldn't any wheat products be extremely rare and valuable at that point? NASA has gone ""underground"" and some mysterious force brings Cooper there. Did they forget about their best test pilot that just happened to be living an hour away? If Cooper is able to communicate with his daughter at the end by touching the light shards, couldn't he also say ""HEY BY THE WAY THIS IS YOUR DAD I'M ALIVE AND I LOVE YOU"" in between relaying the equations?"
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Anzai,10,Fri Jun 19 23:51:15 2015 UTC,"I love Nolan (and space films as well), but Interstellar is easily his worst work. From the moment I left the theater, the more I thought about the movie, the more I realized how stupid it was. I must admit that the whole segment with the water planet and its aftermath, especially the consequences of relativistic voyages, was interesting and well executed, but what I hated the most is how Interstellar treats itself as a serious, realistic sci-fi movie and then shits all over modern physics in the final act. I guessed that the aliens were future humans, and I still think that was a good concept, but having them being the main character in the end is, just as you described it, silly.  I did write a post on /r/movies after watching it, where I theorized on the possibility that Cooper dies upon entering the black hole:  http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2mf9l1/interstellars_ending_and_2001_a_space_odyssey/  I think that interpretation pushes the film up a bit, but it was still disappointing for me."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Squonkster,3,Sat Jun 20 04:56:42 2015 UTC,"I remember reading that. I liked your post a lot.  I'm curious where you feel it derails...for me, I thought the movie would have been far better if it had ended right after he successfully relays the information to Murph. The tesseract wasn't great, but that's largely a construct of the explanation for things that they dive into after that scene...take that whole sequence out, and you could achieve a similar thing without it (meaning that, even though it's included in the movie after my suggested ""cut"", if that cut was done before production, it could have been morphed into something else)."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Anzai,9,Sat Jun 20 09:19:51 2015 UTC,"I can't take you seriously sorry. You make some good enough points, but you also claim that Interstellar is not as good as Armageddon, the most unwatchable pile of tripe every created. I genuinely was unable to finish that movie it was so idiotic and just, painful.  Whilst Interstellar has some moments that are silly, or don't quite make sense, it kept me pretty engaged throughout. If you're prepared to suspend disbelief for Armageddon, why are you picking on Interstellar in any way at all for scientific stumbles? It sells itself as a big action movie, and it is. It's based on real science, but as Nolan himself said, if it doesn't fit the narrative or the look of the film, he's changing it."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,whiteyak41,5,Sat Jun 20 17:07:24 2015 UTC,"Roger Ebert's quote ""It's not what a movie is about, it's how it is about it"" really shows the difference between Armageddon and Interstellar. Armageddon is dumb action fluff but never pretends to be anything more. Interstellar presents itself as a deep emotional, philosophical, and scientifically-accurate story about saving mankind but ultimately boils down to the complete fantasy idea of love being the most powerful force in the universe."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Anzai,3,Sat Jun 20 00:05:50 2015 UTC,"I've heard this argument a lot, but I reject it personally. Armageddon is a stupid movie, but it never pretends it isn't, doesn't change the fact tht it's a stupid movie and hard to watch. Interstellar seems to rub people the wrong way because it's a popcorn movie at tries to have a little bit of thought behind it whilst still being largely about spectacle and effects.  People seem so angry at the middle ground. They want big and stupid Transformers or Fast and Furious or whatever, or prestige Oscar bait films. Dare to mix the two and people seem to tear a film apart for getting ideas above its station. Personally I'd rather my fluff have a little bit of substance to go with the silly. Interstellar is flawed, true, and that speech Hathaway goes about love is idiotic, but I'm not going to hate a film for trying and failing to be as profound as it would like to be, but then give a pass to painfully stupid and cynically made action that doesn't even try to respect its audience."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,whiteyak41,9,Sat Jun 20 14:14:40 2015 UTC,"Granted it's been a while since I've seen all of Armageddon, though I did just catch the opening recently on HBO, but what I think the commenter is getting at is the sense of fun in Armageddon.   It's certainly not a ""good"" movie, it's full of every dumb Bayism you could think of, but it also doesn't take 45 plus minutes to get going. It's full of rich, albeit very cartoony characters, has driving camerawork unlike the boring locked off Interstellar, and it's got a killer Aerosmith song in the credits. Armageddon is a movie that knows exactly what it is: a dumb, fun movie about dudes trying to save the world by blowing up an asteroid.   Interstellar THINKS it's a deep, emotional movie about the power of love and science, but is still just a dumb silly movie about a guy who is THE ONLY person in the world who can go on a mission from secret NASA after finding a message that (spoiler alert is from himself in the future) to save the world (which is dying because the only food left is corn not to mention the New York Yankees play in a little league sized field, no one believes we landed on the moon even though it's only forty years in the future) by traveling through a worm-hole with a guy who doesn't know what a wormhole hole is, a women who will later risk the mission she's been training her whole life for because she's in love with a character we're not introduced to until two hours into the movie. I could go on, but I think you get the point. Interstellar is just as cornball, implausible, but instead of Steve Buscemi crackin' wise or Bruce Willis shooting stuff we get hamfisted monologues, clunky exposition, and A LOT of Matthew McConaughey crying in a sound mix that was so bad many audiences had trouble even hearing the dialogue."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Anzai,-1,Sat Jun 20 02:47:17 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the complaints about interstellar are based more on people's perceptions of what the movie should've rather than what it is. Because its not jokey, people seem to want it to be highly accurate and plausible. It's still an adventure movie. The fact that characters aren't winking at the camera doesn't mean it can't be a fanciful boys own adventure type of movie.  But as for Armageddon, it is so far from fun for me to watch. It just makes me mad with its defiant stupidity. It doesn't seem to know how dumb it is ALL the time, sometimes it wants you to take it seriously. But how can I get upset about Bruce Willis's sacrifice when he's barely even a real person. The characters aren't rich, they're just vague attitudes with different looks so you can tell them apart."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,vanulovesyou,4,Sat Jun 20 21:53:39 2015 UTC,"Again, I can't defend Armageddon. It's loud, overstuffed, racist, characters are cartoons and the logic of the story is all over the place. As for Interstellar, I'm fine meeting it on its own terms. I went in with low expectations, knowing nothing really about the story, and the movie just didn't work for me. None of my nitpicks have anything to do with science or realism, they have everything to do with storytelling. Because if, as you sugest the movie is an adventure flick, it's a really bad adventure flick. The characters are bland, the dialogue is sloppy at best, and everything that might be exciting is filmed in a way that sucks out all of the excitement.  I can think of a specific example where Nolan's camerawork works directly against my enjoyment of the story. Every time we cut to the spaceship, we either see it as an extreeemme wide, or more often the camera is locked onto the spaceship with the world moving in the background. The first time I saw that shot I thought it looked cool and added some realism, but that's practically the only angle he used making it extremely difficult to gauge the geography of what's actually happening. So everytime they're blasting off or flying through a wormhole or doing something that theoretically should be exciting I can't get emotionally invested because I can't actually tell what's going on.  As for the writing, I can think of maybe 3 scenes of actual adventure or joy. There's far more people crying or expositing philosophy about how the world is doomed than there are set pieces.  I'm not saying the movie should be like a JJ Abrams Star Trek where every five minutes something crazy exciting happens, I'm fine with a slow burn or a more relaxed pace provided the stuff in between the set pieces works, but here it really doesn't.  I suppose it's noble of Nolan to try to do something grander in his storytelling but that doesn't make it a more enjoyable movie. It's a very bleak, cynical film with very few moments of levity or excitement. So if indeed Nolan was trying to make a adventure film, he made a pretty piss poor one in my opinion."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,death_to_all_humans,0,Sat Jun 20 23:03:35 2015 UTC,"It's all subjective of course, but I liked the way it was shot. The extreme wide stuff made things feel more isolated. It was showing how small the ships were compared to the enormity of what they were up against. And by an adventure film, I don't mean action, i mean adventure in the old sense, where the environment is the key to the excitement.  I find at grandiose admiration for the sheer vastness of space exciting. Zooming space ships shot close like the star trek reboots do nothing for me. I'm a star trek fan, but those movies sucked the heart out of the franchise in the same way Nolan's style sucked the excitement out of interstellar for you.  I guess we just don't like the same type of popcorn fun, as I can't find any joy in Abrams or Bay at all. Their movies just fatigue me at best, and usually actually irritate me. Nolan leans too heavily on exposition through dialogue sometimes, but that never really bothers me too much, as his more measured pacing and at least some level of thought in between his action set pieces keeps me from getting bored. It's fast cameras and action without substance that bore me more, whether or not it 'knows it's stupid' or not."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,nerga,2,Sat Jun 20 02:59:56 2015 UTC,"I thought both Interstellar and Gravity were extremely overrated, and I was both bored and bemused during both films at one time or another. (Yeah, heresy, I know, right?) And I am someone who loves space movies and who should have enjoyed both of them.  The characterization and dialogue was just poorly developed for both flicks. But, since space films are a bit rare these days, I am glad both they were made, and I can't be too critical, I suppose. They did have some redeeming qualities."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,dccorona,2,Sat Jun 20 04:28:36 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with it was the inconsistent characterization.  The people sent up on the spaceship are supposed to be a bunch of brilliant scientists, humanity's last hope.  They're trained by NASA, which despite lacking resources wouldn't have less knowledge of how space works than we do in the present day.  But despite supposedly being scientific geniuses, the characters constantly behave like idiots in order to advance the plot.  Like how they didn't understand that time dilation works both ways until after they already fucked up.  If one hour on the planet's surface is equal to seven years outside of the time dilation sphere, and the explorer people were sent out ten years before, the best case scenario they could have hoped for is finding that scientist less than ninety minutes after she landed, not nearly enough time to tell if the planet is habitable or not.  The people sent to the other two planets that were not affected by time dilation like that would have actually had adequate time to determine whether or not their planets are habitable.  Going to that first planet was a total waste of time and resources even if nobody died.    Also, Matt Damon was sent on a solo mission through the deepest reaches of space and landed on a new planet all by himself but he doesn't know how space works apparently.  You'd have thought that at some point during his astronaut training somebody would have explained to him what an airlock is for and that space is a vacuum."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,lordhadri,8,Sat Jun 20 04:59:12 2015 UTC,"The IMDB top 250 is an afront to film. It is an absolutely awful list of the top films. Interstellar did a few things well. It had some nice photography, and good tech. But as a film it wasn't good. The plot was simple and insulting to the viewer. The performances weren't very good. The cinematography outside of the space shots were all bad.  You say you are a Nolan fan.... but then you don't like half-assed character development and arbitrary dialogue? Those are like his calling cards. Nolan is the ""tell don't show"" director in my book. You don't have to watch the film, just listen to dialogue for a boring play by play of what is happening."

I didn't like the whole ""humans from the future go back to the past to fulfill events that already happened"" concept. It was ridiculous and didn't make any sense. The problem with those kinds of plotlines is always the question: what happens if the time traveler chooses not to fulfill the events from the past? Maybe I could have bought into the story in Interstellar if they had made up some kind of answer to this question, but the film didn't address this problem at all. I had a hard enough time buying this when Harry Potter did it, so there's no way I'm going to buy it when a sci-fi film does it.  The film had plenty of other problems too. I think the main problem was that the film was way too long. If the film had been shorter, the bad bits wouldn't have been a big deal."

Not to mention the ex machina that end is, really uninspired if you ask me, it could as well be ""and then God himself descended from Heaven and saved humanity""  And that's the major problem, there's also the nitpicking problems like: why the higher dimensional beings chose such a clusterfuckered plan to save humanity?"

TrueFilm,3ag57s,Foxtrot56,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:46:48 2015 UTC,"I'm tired of everyone saying that love breaks the laws of physics in Interstellar. The only thing that transcends time in the movie is gravity. The two parts the characters say they are driven by love are when Brand wants to go to one planet and not the other, and how Cooper finds the moments he needs to find in the end. Let's take the first, Brand DOES end up being right, but is it because she loved Wolf, or is it because that planet was further from the black hole so more celestial events were able to happen to the planet and develop it, as she also explained? The second is Cooper finding the right moment in the tesseract. He wasn't more able than the bulk beings to find the moment because he loves his daughter, he's able to because he's bound by time so can navigate it more easily. The characters believe in their instincts based on love, and are driven towards survival on a primal level because of it, but they never break any laws of physics with love."

The whole black hole deal is way too convenient. It looks like an anime from the 90s when the main character, against all logic, gains a ridiculous power up just so he can solve the all the problems."

The character development is really important because they are showing, not telling, you about the world they live in and how it got there. It was a really smart way to do a sci-fi movie in the future that is about space travel and still make it human, tell a story and history of the world.   It tried to do a lot of things, it did some better than others but if you can't enjoy the special effects, the music and the cinematography then you are just a grinch."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,sgSaysR,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:03:50 2015 UTC,"I think that's why I liked Interstellar: it's a goofy little sci-fi film shown on the grand scale of a big, serious one, with a few serious moments thrown in for fun. You think that humans are going to evolve to encompass five dimensions and manipulate time just so they can get a test pilot to Morse-code humanity to the stars? You think that a film with a sarcastic talking robot making snide comments about the mission itself is going to be as serious as 2001?  It's not a comedy - it's like watching an old Hollywood sci-fi movie. A throwback film done in the style of today."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,hrgilbert,6,Thu Jun 25 20:34:23 2015 UTC,I don't think that's how Nolan movies work. You can tell from the soundtrack and direction it takes itself seriously. TARS is a minor comic relief to lighten the mood occasionally but in no way is it lighthearted.

TrueFilm,3ag57s,lokijki,2,Sat Jun 20 11:46:58 2015 UTC,"I thought Interstellar was incredibly silly. That being said, there are still some aspects of the movie that I really enjoyed. The visuals were quite nice, the score by Hans Zimmer was sufficiently epic (although I did think it detracted from immersion into the film), and I thought Matthew McConaughey turned in an (inter)stellar performance.   But at the end of the day, it was a Johnny Badass saves the day kind of a movie and not very well executed at that. There are some very well made dude-saves-the-day kind of movies, and I absolutely love them; Pacific Rim, and the Indiana Jones movies are some great examples. I honestly never felt worried for Cooper's safety. They gave him so much screen time that it was inconceivable that any harm would come to him.  In some ways, Christopher Nolan is the anti-Kubrick. He packs his movies with SO MUCH EXPOSITION, almost as if he's a school teacher making his students learn their times tables. This habit of vomiting exposition worked really well in The Prestige (which I still consider his best work) because the whole movie was one giant con. It worked well in the Batman movies. It really got on my nerves in Inception, where you even get a tutorial on dreams droned out by Leonardo DiCaprio's character. This is what bugged me the most this movie. No character could have even a thought before it had to be immediately verbalised. In fact, I can pinpoint the exact moment I started losing interest in the film. It was right after the physicists explain to Cooper that they received data from previous missions that were sent into the wormhole. It was perfectly poised at that point to be a fantastic movie. I remember getting goosebumps then. After that scene, it was back to exposition, exposition, and more droning exposition.  I thought the plot was terribly hackneyed. I'll go ahead and say it. I thought the initial incident was pretty bullshit. Really, you land on a new planet, and immediately start gallivanting about like you owned the place? I thought the story was not much more than a collection of incidents that merely served to show the viewer pretty CGI and spot some more stuff about wormholes, to appeal to ""nerd culture"" presumably. The story was definitely very weak, in my opinion.  Lastly, the future tech in the movie seemed phoned it,. Yes, they ran a fancy schmancy simulation of a black hole, and yes TARS and CASE were brilliant. But to explain what I mean by 'phoned in', I must mention my favourite science fiction movie of all time; 2001: A Space Odyssey (big surprise right?). There's are two scenes in the movie which stand out to me, and which I always mention whenever anyone talks about 'attention to detail' in film. What those two scenes show is nothing more than an attendant in the space ship bringing dinner to the ship's passengers. She is shown wearing Grip Shoes, presumable velcro bottomed shoes so that she may walk around in the zero gravity of space. What were Interstellar's ""Grip Shoes""? I don't think there were any. Yes, there is plenty blinking lights and buttons, a few touch screens here and there, but there are no Grip Shoes."

That said, I can't imagine myself watching it again any time soon. It's got tons of clunky exposition, which I can bear on the first viewing, but I imagine will turn it into a slog on the second.   Inception had the same issue; the first time you can sit through the characters explaining the rules of the movie to you, but once you know the rules... not quite as fun. I've sat through that one a bunch of times, and at this point I really have no desire to see it again, but it was a lot of fun the first time."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,pushafridge,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:12:43 2015 UTC,"For me, it's a family drama set in a scientifc scenario. It's mainly about the regrets of the father leaving his family / his daughter alone. Not the son - there seems to be no real connection.  Therefore the tragic with planet #1 and the video-watching-scene. Therefore the drama with the multidimensional space and that the father itself is the person who sends the morse-code which says ""stay"".   For me, that is the nucleus of the film: a simple family story that unfolds in a most extreme scenario.  Best small scene: The father, drivng alone to his mission, looking at the co-drivers-seat if his daughter has been hidden under the blankets. McConaughey expressions is like he somehow hoped for it."
TrueFilm,3ag57s,Blackbeard_,0,Sun Jun 21 05:51:11 2015 UTC,"I've watched the movie four times and actually took notes the fourth time watching it very critically. Never got around to writing about it so here it goes. Also, I don't think the science was that bad except for the frozen clouds. It's very theoretical and the point is that you can't say what Nolan try to depict is impossible. Also, keep in mind that wormholes aren't real and there are research to show that a black hole that's big enough and spins fast enough can avoid spaghettification so maybe that assumed that with the worm hole as well.  I thought the movie was done pretty well except for some noticeable flaws so I'd give it 7/10.  Here are just some rants/questions I have:   How incapable is this team? (I know that people gave up on NASA but c'mon) Romilly can't stand dizziness, Brand crumbles utterly under pressure, Cooper is the smartest and the dumbest at the same time (like you don't know what a fucking wormhole is but you can spot a blackhole from an archaic image of Saturn?) and Doyle is just Doyle (trying to be the smartass all the time but he's not realistic - too blind in fuck Earth, I just wanna get something done) How did Cooper figure out Brand's love and how does Brand know Cooper knows? (Ya, he asked TARS but how did he ever get that clue?) I love how no one cares Doyle fucking died when they returned from Miller. All you see is Brand talking about how relativity is so different in real life from theory... uhh... hate to break it to you but... it's not. Why does no one give credit to Brand's remarks about Edmunds vs. Mann's? Yes, she may be biased but she had great points. But all you get is Cooper saying ""okay you love this guy. argument dismissed even tho it was totally fair and you probably know A LOT more than i do.""      Brand was fucking terrible, not just because of the character but also because Ann Hathahate sucked in acting for that role.Here are my rants:   Super silly (she had some line like ""does this door even open? nvm."" on top of that, I don't think anyone heard her when she said that) Unprofessional (at the NASA round table when trying to recruit Cooper, pretty much mocking him as totally incompetent). Keep in mind, the world is near extinction... But you do get to see her rational side, like arguing time as resource for Miller's planet.  Hathaway did a horrible job about portraying her emotions after decision to go to Mann's and not Edmund's. Her facial expression as she says ""Cooper, you'll have to decide between saving the human race and seeing you family again"" is just like so bad. ""The Horrible Lies"" - bitch, why you so caught about Plan A when the whole time you didn't really give a fuck cuz there's Plan B?  130% of Earth's gravity and you're PANTING? Have you never been in an elevator? Oh wait, you just got sent to outer space... on a mission to save mannkind Have to bring up the ""I knew theory but relativity is different"" in real life... WTF... Did she go full retard when she talks about love transcending time? Why the fuck does she laugh after the emergency docking? like YAY we did it! (This just might be her character and just my not being able to deal with it) Hathaway did have one piece of good acting, which was when Cooper tells her he's gonna be dropped into the black hole and she says, ""Don't.""   Also, did anyone else notice the NASA flag at the round table?  All in all, I don't think the movie was that great. It underachieved. I think I'm biased in that it was nice to see Nolan try something different and that I really liked McConaughey's performance. Matt could've done better, but it was good.     EDIT: Not sure if people are going to read this but this feels SOOO cathartic for some reason."

TrueFilm,3ag57s,FuzzyLoveRabbit,9,Sat Jun 20 07:09:11 2015 UTC,"Actual scientists like the fact that they took the time to properly visualise a wormhole etc, but the film remains a fiction which took some ""cool ideas"" and rendered them properly, incorporating them into a clunky story about ""hope and love"". It's really not a scientific film about scientists behaving scientifically.  Nothing wrong with that. It's a movie not a documentary. But let's not oversell the ""sciencey"" thing.  For instance - I don't think they're particularly onboard with, say, the main character being told how a wormhole works just before entering it, using a scene from Event Horizon. Or the ridiculous discussion scenes about what needs to be done where everyone talks about things they already should know, as if they were just understanding the situation (e.g. before going to the water planet).  Nor do they consider particularly scientific the idea that some ""bulk beings"" are into doing some multi-dimensional carpentry so that an astronaut can use it to move some dust about in order to communicate with family members.  It looks great, and a lot of it is ""inspired by"" popular scientific theories, and avoids straying into impossible mechanics, but it's primarily science fantasy. Despite the hype and ambition, it's no 2001: A Space Odyssey. I think it harmed our perception of the film that people tried to sell it as such.  TL;DR: Nice production design ""inspired by"" consultations with scientists and engineers; cool robots. Ambitious sense of scale; enjoyable visuals; B-movie storytelling."

That's basically like asking for a movie that only they can understand. Of all the things to be upset about scientifically about the movie, leveraging the characters to provide exposition about concepts many people haven't even heard about coming into the movie, much less understand, is a really bad one.   I don't know where you came up with this list, but I suspect it's not at all based on what the majority of scientists feel about the movie. I don't think you should present it as such without even a single reference. Sounds more like you listing the things you disliked, and extrapolating from there."

It's just an observation that the film does not really aspire to be accurate in terms of its characters or dialogue or storytelling. It aspires to be a great blockbuster science-fiction movie that is more grounded compared to the usual science-fantasy fare.  Since the characters just don't behave like scientists or astronauts - and do in fact behave more like the characters in Event Horizon -  it naturally leads to a bit of amusement!  The movie takes some interesting theoretical physics concepts (basically: wormholes, tesseracts) and used it as the basis for an impressive visual story. It's great to see those ideas used to create a blockbuster movie! But... it really isn't aiming to be hard science so we shouldn't critique it in those terms. It's a mistake for people to sell it on that basis. I actually think it does the film some harm to do so.  For recent accuracy in terms of space travel and scientist behaviour, something like Europa Report is a much better film. Interview with one of the consultants here; interview with the screenwriter here. However, it must be said that Europa Report is just a little bit... boring.  Source: me and my science friends. But since you want a reference, this is quite a good read where lots of scientists have responded with their thoughts on Interstellar.   ...leveraging the characters to provide exposition about concepts many people haven't even heard    See, this is the real problem with the film. Characters shouldn't need to be ""leveraged"" to provide exposition - that's a sign of poor plot design and bad characterisation. This information should be integrated into the film.

What can you do that feels more natural? Having characters that already understand it re-state it plainly feels wrong, and these aren't concepts that can really reasonably be ""shown not told"" in the course of a movie, unless the entire point of the movie is to teach those concepts, which isn't the goal here."

To ponder: Do they need to be up to speed?  I think Nolan's major flaw - in Interstellar but also in Inception - is that he has characters lecture at one another but to the audience. He want to lay out the theory behind the film rather than to show it occurring. He's really not a very visual director at all: he has great visuals, but he doesn't let them talk to you, he has characters explain them over the top. And usually they've already done so earlier in the film.  For the pre-wormhole scene I propose... ...that nobody says anything.  The Wormhole Sequence  All that is required beforehand is the idea that we know: a) That there is a wormhole and, b) That wormholes provide direct passage to distant parts of the universe. That's already taken care of before we get there. As an audience, we don't need anything more than that.   The scene then focuses upon Cooper and Romilly weighing up the ""gravity landscape"" as it were (excuse multiple puns), the best way to ""play"" the approach, now that they are there and can take direct measurements using their equipment. See him planning it out together with Romilly. This could all be done visually, with tense silences punctuated with some expressive exchanges. These don't need to describe exactly what they are doing, just build up the emotion and anticipation.  We could be given time in the movie to feel the importance of this situation. To let the tension build. To see the wormhole as both a friend (possibility) and a threat (unknowability). And when it comes to actually entering the wormhole, we focus completely on the visceral experience of it.  Talking Concepts   unless the entire point of the movie is to teach those concepts   Which it isn't. I'd argue that it doesn't need to teach the concepts at all. If characters already know something, they don't need to say it. It is enough that we know that they know (which requires they be well-drawn enough that we believe and trust this) and that we are emotionally aligned with them.  The irony is that by having them talk in Exposition Mode, we actually believe the situation less because we believe in the characters less.  So I'm interested if you have a view on this:   Other than ""showing off"" the research that was done to support the film, is there really any benefit to having all the characters talk-explain everything? Ariadne's early scenes in Inception are a great example, I believe, of where it would have worked better if the explanatory discussion had been reduced. The visuals already presented a logical sequence of events which gave us the information; it didn't need to be explained in words."

I enjoyed the movie, though its failings aren't lost on me (particularly, I think it should have ended right after he successfully relayed the data to Murph). That twist is also far more grounded in actual theoretical physics than you would think, although still full of holes scientifically.   I think most people enjoyed it because of its combination of some really powerful moments, and its realistic treatment of space travel (realistic isn't the right word, necessarily, but it was presented more realistically than most sci-fi movies present it, particularly in recent years).  You also missed out on one of the best parts by watching it on home video...half of what made it so good was how breathtaking it was in IMAX. It's kind of like watching Avatar on DVD and not understanding what everyone was on about (although I do think Interstellar has far more merit beyond being pretty than Avatar does)."

The thing is, it's inconsistent:    Just before they enter the wormhole he needs it explained to him.  Then, soon after, when there's a debate about how best to handle investigating the Miller's planet, he's happily chirping away about orbital mechanics.   This isn't at all problematic unless we are trying to promote the film as maintaining a level of coherence and scientific veracity that, really, it doesn't.  I think your points about it being a great IMAXian experience and giving a visceral feeling of space travel are spot on. That's where its strengths lie. Watched at home on the small screen, the characters inconsistencies and clumsy storytelling before more evident because the sense of epic scale and stunning visual presence are no longer there."

The former is taught far earlier in school than the latter. The former is something he would have learned from his time in flight simulators and flight school, while the latter is something they wouldn't even mention in such courses because it is (or would have been considered, as it is today) entirely irrelevant. Understanding black holes is not a prerequisite to being a pilot. Understanding gravity is."

We can for sure rationalise it, but...  In the film, it's simply poorly handled. It's an obvious exposition dump to the audience, rather than integrated into the character development and plot. When it's useful to have Cooper ask a question, he's asking it. When it's useful for Cooper to have a clever plan and be the leader, he has it. The characters are walking plot-points and information-announcers to the audience, rather than to each other.  Again, this is a flaw in the film as written. It's a very enjoyable movie as an experience, but the fact is that, although it is ""inspired by"" and admirably incorporates these interesting scientific ideas, it is not a scientific movie, and it doesn't present scientists and astronauts as being very... scientific either. I'm not sure it was ever meant to really; it was just part of the marketing story."

He had just been told about it recently in the scene that was posted, and had to ask questions like ""how close until it starts happening"", and then used his knowledge orbits (which it seemed realistic that he would have) to find a way to get to the surface without getting the ship too close to that boundary. He's not presented inconsistently, he's just presented as a fast learner.   I don't disagree that the exposition can feel out of place and direct. It could have been done better.

I think it's just a shame that the screenplay didn't get another couple of drafts to iron these things out. If you read Jonathan Nolan's 2008 screenplay you can see how some bits were lifted out of context and pasted together to make the film we got (the drones, sending a message back, and discovering NASA all make more sense).

I thought it made me sympathize with the main character more, and not spend  the entire move wishing he would fail(which would have made for a bad movie), but rooting for him. This makes me as a viewer that much creeped out about myself.   Although Nightcrawler didn't have the feel of a commentary, I think that prevalent thematic elements were consistent. Namely, how inherently disturbed our own common apologies for capitalism and effective business practices are. He takes advantage of the poor, and kills him when he has bargaining rights; he uses government agencies that were intended to protect people for his own gain, etc. During all of this, he cites the rules and methods of effective business. His success reinforces this. The logical end to the ending is that Lou becomes a major business leader in the media.   So, regarding the tonal dissonance, I think it was ironic. We were supposed to buy into Lou's reasoning and actions, and overlook the darker side of it. At least, according to the score."
TrueFilm,3ah4wf,AquaCheetah,11,Sat Jun 20 05:18:22 2015 UTC,I agree with you. At the center of Nightcrawler is a dissonant character. A man whose relationship with humanity is completely detached. Lou believes in his greatness and Newton Howard's superheroic theme appropriately reflects his delusions of grandeur.
TrueFilm,3ah4wf,larrygopnik,7,Sat Jun 20 07:48:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the soundtrack was intentional... but what I find interesting is how the ambiguity of 'intention' actually lends to this sense of unease a lot of people felt in regards to it. And I think,  it actually improved the film for me. That feeling, which you described, of it being ""off"" is almost the same feeling you would experience when meeting a person like Lou.    When I think about examples from other films of soundtrack dissonance, it seems the intention is very clear.  Two examples I can think of off the top of my head is the famous ""Hip to Be Square"" scene in American Psycho and also maybe ""Singing in the Rain""/Beethoven's Symphony from A Clockwork Orange (ok singin in the rain isn't really 'soundtrack' but still).  In both those films, it's very clear that the musical choices are intended to lend the scene a sense of tonal dissonance. Especially in the face of violence and sexual assault. No question. It makes it seem extra fucked up.  Thing about Nightcrawler, it wasn't as obvious. I picked up on it while watching the film but it felt weird. Like you said, it doesn't go so far to create irony...just this sense of discomfort. Of it being ""off"", a weird choice, something that doesn't quite fit.  Not creepy enough, not normal enough. Just off.   It's like when Lou parrots Business Studies 101 - the film is using a well-trodden style of hollywood score (like in the car crash scene) but it doesn't quite seem to fit.   It made the film itself seem like a mirror of Lou."

TrueFilm,3ah4wf,youwot,4,Sat Jun 20 13:01:50 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much my exact assessment. I know what they were going for.   I actually think it's a brilliant idea in theory––you expect a score that is dark, minor keys, sinister, to match what's going on, but the film isn't about that. The point of the film is that this is the hero's journey. This is what our society rewards. Lou is the kind of person that we create incentives to elevate, our actions and consuming create people like him. Rather than treating him like the menace he is, our society, in effect, treat him like a hero for his ambition and his clever ruthlessness. Thus, the score should reflect that, with major keys, the music swelling . . . this is the American dream we're watching be achieved, after all.  But it just doesn't quite work. I'm not sure if it's not possible or if they didn't pull it off. It's certainly not an easy task. It is such a great idea that I want to say it could have worked if done a little more subtly . . . maybe start dark but with a faint little empowering theme that grows gradually until by the end it's overtaken the rest of the score? Or maybe go for outright clashing of score and tone, like a scene from A Clockwork Orange? (I feel like that doesn't even work anymore, as it's done so ofter that classical music is just associated with bad guys) Maybe if the tone of the film was different––say, more black comedy––it could have worked to have an outright uplifting score during some of the darkest moments. I don't know.  But I agree, the music does seem to ""diffuse the menace"". For this idea to have worked, the uplifting music should have made us uncomfortable. It should have created a dissonance that made us squirm, rather than undercutting the discomfort of the audience.  So yeah. Great movie. Great idea on scoring. Didn't quite work for me."
TrueFilm,3ah4wf,CommissionerValchek,5,Sat Jun 20 17:26:53 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, and watched Nightcrawler recently, thinking of it somewhat of a 9/10, A- grade movie because of the score personally. As you noted, it really didn't fit the visual style of the film at all. I think the reason I disliked it so much is that it was the only thing that took me out of an otherwise gorgeous and completely engrossing movie  and reminded me that I'm not in the story, I'm just watching a Hollywood movie. This has become a big problem for me lately as a musician and an audio engineer: If I hear poorly mixed or canned foley sounds (like the Wilhelm scream) or strikingly bland Hollywood style orchestral string soundtracks it makes an otherwise engrossing movie harder to get into. The best counterexample to this in recent memory has to be Gone Girl, where I think the score was much better than the movie actually was and helped make the film a much more enjoyable experience.  tl dr James Newton Howard sucks and I want his job because I know I could have given Nightcrawler the score it deserved  edit: I guess I just wanna point out that I'm glad I'm not the only person that felt this problem with Nightcrawler, it's like the score is completely oblivious to what kind of character Lou is. For anyone that wants to add to this, what are some other movies you think the score provides a distractingly dissonant tone to?"
TrueFilm,3ah4wf,medicinemagazines,9,Sat Jun 20 04:57:46 2015 UTC,"I guess there are a few ways to score this sort of film (whether the execution is up to standard is another thing):   Score the scene from the overall story's perspective. (3rd person objective.) In other words, score what the filmmaker reckons you should think and feel about a scene as a part of the story. (Spielbergian? Williamsian?) Score the scene from the character's story. (2nd person objective.) In other words, score what the filmmaker reckons you should think and feel about the character as part of the story. (Morriconian?) Score the scene from the character's perspective. (1st person subjective.) In other words, score what the filmmaker reckons the character feels about a scene from his own understanding within the story. (Suggestions?)   I think Nightcrawler attempted the third and I feel that's the correct approach. The film is within the character rather than about the character or about the world?  How would you have scored it differently?"
TrueFilm,3ah4wf,TriumphantGeorge,3,Sat Jun 20 10:01:57 2015 UTC,"I think the idea that it's within Lou is spot on, but I think that might be what took me out of it in terms of the soundtrack. Probably just a personal preference thing. It's been a long time since I've seen it, and it's far from my favourite film, but the score in Gone Girl was absolutely one of the films strengths.  That's a really cool breakdown of the use of score in film!  I feel like Gone Girl was definitely what you described as a 3rd person objective score - very traditional in the way it complements the cinematography and writing and so on. It becomes just another one of the filmmaker's tools for creating an atmosphere and forcing a perspective. I think Lou's perceived control of the score in Nightcrawler just breaks from the mould of what I expect from a tonally darker film and that throws me. Maybe I'll acclimatise to it over a few viewings, but maybe it's just something weird and unfamiliar. I can't really remember any other films doing this in a way that clashes with our initial perception of the subject matter - I guess it would require some kind of antihero/villainous lead."
TrueFilm,3ah4wf,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sat Jun 20 12:39:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'll acclimatise to it over a few viewings, but maybe it's just something weird and unfamiliar.   Yes, I agree it's unfamiliar. I think that often the three different approaches merge into one in typical ""Hollywood"" (or rather, culturally western) filmmaking. If a film focuses on a central ""hero"" character who is the moral centre of a story, one which depicts a world which reflects our own culture, then in terms of the score we have:     Overall Story = Character Story = Character Perspective   Nightcrawler breaks the final equivalence.    ...but the score in Gone Girl was absolutely one of the films strengths.   Coincidentally, planned to re-watch Gone Girl this weekend so I'll bear this in mind. I saw it in the cinema and really enjoyed it... we'll see what at-home, score-conscious viewing does to that."
TrueFilm,3ah4wf,micahjohnston,2,Sat Jun 20 12:58:15 2015 UTC,"I really disagree over what the role of the score was intended to be. I think it was intended strictly to convey Lou's inner emotional states throughout the film, since the whole thing is a character study where you immerse yourself in his way of looking at the world. The moment where Lou is dragging a dead body to get a better shot of it, and the score swells in a triumphant way, really conveys the way he is feeling in that moment as he learns and progresses. Now even the soundtrack is expressing the same repulsive disrespect for human life that the rest of the characters have been.  You mentioned the moment when he enters the house following the shooting. The soundtrack is not triumphant here, it's tense and dark, but this isn't to ""reflect Lou's descent further into complete depravity""...it's to reflect that he's feeling tense and scared! Same with the epilogue scene. You say how the triumph is ""almost too much,"" but this is exactly as intended. At this point, the viewer is supposed to feel repulsed and alienated by the amorality of almost everything in the film, and the celebratory music pushes this further.  Basically, the film would have been much more morally and thematically simplistic without the score. If, whenever Lou does something that makes us uneasy, the music was there to talk over him and remind us that we, the highly moral viewers, should think he is depraved, it wouldn't be challenging and ambiguous in the way that it is. The score serves to further immerse us in his emotional world, making us actually consider his actions from his point of view rather than remaining at a safe distance."
TrueFilm,3ah4wf,ALargeDingo,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:54:58 2015 UTC,"Aw man, a Reznor/Ross score would have been perfect. The more menacing tracks from The Social Network would have been spot on for the intellectual terror that is Lou Bloom.   That said, the score actually matched the film pretty well. The elements that stand out most (for good reason) are Gyllenhall's absolutely tremendous performance and the slightly off kilter writing of his character.   But apart from this, the film stays traditional in terms of editing, cinematography, and especially the performances of the other characters. They are the normal people. Lou is not. The straightforward and literal nature of the movie is totally at odds with its main character, which beautifully enhances the experience of spending time with a monster like Lou."
TrueFilm,3ah4wf,somuchless,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:38:43 2015 UTC,"I'll try to find this but I read somewhere that the director used the score in a very specific way. The score is connected to Lou's state of mind, it reveals what's going on in his head. I think the dissonance between the score and the events in the film reflects the fact that Lou does not think ""right"" about what's going on around him. You are hearing Lou's sociopathic inner ""soundtrack"" to his life."
TrueFilm,3ah4wf,BogusSoup,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:01:50 2015 UTC,"You've recognized that it's intentionally dissonant (from a certain perspective), but I think you're misunderstanding the purpose of that dissonance. It's not to enhance his creepiness through irony. It's to normalize it. Nightcrawler isn't trying to tell a story about a crazy guy who becomes some sort of entrepreneurial villain; the central theme is about how Lou's exploitative (towards his employee and Nina and towards tragedy) and harmful practices are encouraged by society and capitalism. So the score works like it would in a ""birth of an artist"" story, as Gilroy (or maybe Gyllenhaal) put it."
TrueFilm,3aevm0,CineMasai,14,Fri Jun 19 15:44:03 2015 UTC,"I just got back from Dope about an hour or two ago.  I enjoyed the movie, but not as much as you did by comparison.  I really enjoyed the inventiveness in music selection as well as how they used music throughout the film.  I also thought they did a decent job of handling social media within a film.  The group of three friends in the film were really well acted and fun to watch.  That being said, I had a couple problems with the film as well.  First, the story just kind of meanders about 3/4 of the way through the film (right about the point we get to Blake Anderson's character).  Also the entire sideplot involving Nikki just ended up feeling unnecessary at the end of the film.  Like I get that he's a complex person and he didn't just change from A to B, but Nikki wasn't the best mirror to show this.  It was like the film started out being a straight plot driven story about Malcolm doing whatever he could so he could be closer to Nikki, then completely shifted gears into a different direction only the shift wasn't seamless and as a result the message was a little shaky until the end.  This meandering wouldn't have felt so out of place if not for my second complaint, the story didn't feel effectively streamlined around the message that was presented at the end of the film.  When I got to the end of the film and heard Malcolm's whole speech about Student A and Student B, I thought well that's a really interesting perspective, I wish there had been more efforts to highlight character development throughout the film in the case of Malcolm instead of him just sort of begrudgingly going along or acting out of fright until the minor AHA moment when he reveals to AJ that he can turn him in (I didn't really like how they tried to make it a twist).     Don't get me wrong I enjoyed Dope and felt there were a large number of things that it did well (and it is 100% a great coming-of-age film for black nerds), but I also don't know that I'd give this film the moniker funniest of all time and would probably just give it a B or B-."
TrueFilm,3aevm0,choldslingshot,3,Sat Jun 20 05:02:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thoughts. I feel like it had half a dozen false endings. Like, they were all ready to have the credits roll, but Oh yeah! we need to tie up this sideplot. It was frustrating. It's a funny movie sure, and I hope other films like it get made, but it certainly had its missteps."
TrueFilm,3aevm0,sober_as_an_ostrich,3,Sat Jun 20 05:30:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think the ""A-HA"" moment is the final scene with AJ but rather when Malcolm threatens his bullies with the pistol.  Up until that point, we do see Malcolm begrudgingly follow instructions or act out of fear.  He does this because he completely disassociates his identity with the stereotypes of his community.  Even at the beginning the narrator describes Malcolm as being into ""white kid stuff"", he's so interested in non-conformity that he actively rejects any notion that he shares anything in common with Dom or his bullies, despite growing up in the se neighborhood and liking the same music (he prides himself on being a 90s hip hop geek but other kids in the neighborhood seem to know more about the genre than him anyway).  Shit, his band is even a homonym for the famous cookie that's black on the outside and white in the middle.    Of course, Malcolm is thrust into a stereotypically ""ghetto"" narrative - he has to move a ton of drugs in a violent community.  Malcolm first approaches the conflict with his ""white-kid"" mentality - use bitcoin, remain anonymous, play up his nerdiness to sneak around, etc.  But in an act of survival, Malcolm has to play the other role.  To quote the famous TV show, he becomes the danger.  And at this point Malcolm realizes that he isn't ""Kid A"" or ""Kid B"" (as he describes in his application) but rather both parts, and is everything in between.  Malcolm's scene with AJ shows him melding the two roles to fulfill his objective...he plays the nerdy card by hacking past AJ's firewall to eliminate his chances of getting caught, but also browbeats him into compliance.  He's able to use more facets of his experience (and ultimately his identity) than  he'd been limiting himself to before.  And he updates his college application from the non-conformist schtick of his Ice Cube dissertation to profoundly engaging with the racial idealism that affected his journey."

TrueFilm,3ag0e5,Alexxandros,22,Fri Jun 19 21:00:00 2015 UTC,"I thought it was Pixar's best film. Truly an inspiring creative work. Gave some terrific insight into the mind of a child who is losing their innocence in the most seemingly innocuous ways. It's amazing to think of the fact that the key dramatic element to the film is Riley moving from her hometown but to a kid, that can be everything and Pixar sold it.  I was really amazed by the thesis though, Joy is having an existential crisis of her own. Joy, though a positive emotion is very selfish and inwardly focused and we see the effect that has on Riley. The film essentially seems to be purporting that too much happiness is a negative thing and that we need negative emotions too like sadness.  The most telling part is when Riley is in front of the class but because Joy is controlling her she won't stop talking to the point where she becomes annoying. Sadness interrupts this display but it was a wonderful scene illustrating how too much Joy could manifest itself as a personality flaw. Wonderful work.  I was also really amazed by their portrayal of San Francisco. For a children's film, they really didn't try to romanticize it at all."
TrueFilm,3ag0e5,eaglesoup,25,Sun Jun 21 08:24:48 2015 UTC,"I felt like most of this movie was really depressing. More so than any Pixar film I've seen. But maybe that was a good thing.  Children are hardly taught about mental health and that often leads to very negative treatment of people who are ""weird."" This movie explores emotion in an interesting way but I don't think it will necessarily help kids treat others better. It at least opens a doorway to better understanding in youths and it was an interesting and original concept. The flow of the narrative was pretty distinct for a Pixar film as well."
TrueFilm,3ag0e5,nkleszcz,14,Sat Jun 20 01:26:20 2015 UTC,"Children are hardly taught about mental health and that often leads to very negative treatment of people who are ""weird.""   And this is really the film's greatest sub-goal. So much subtext and clever distinguishing between what it is to be gripped with mental illness. I like that there is a clear distinction between the melancholy that Sadness embodies...and the melancholy that occurs when the ENTIRE control-room shuts down as Riley leaves home. Somewhere on the bus, she seems to be in the grips of a real existential crisis that resembles depression. She feels no feelings, she is numbed, she doesn't know how to react and seems shut off from her world. I was talking with a friend who's been battling depression this past year and she tells me that the turmoil Riley faces on that bus is an appropriate summation for what it's like to go through that. Whereas Sadness is a critical element of living life (and even Sadness can crack a smile every now and then), the sadness that Riley feels at the end obviously be attributed to Sadness the Phyllis Smith-voiced character. It seems to suggest that, at some point in our lives, our metaphoric Control-Rooms will all stop working for a temporary moment, and we'll have to face the ramifications of what can be determined as depression. It's an incredibly bleak conclusion, but not only is it a necessary one to understand, it's communicated to us, the AUDIENCE, through the subtle powers of cinematic understatement. It's just sad enough for kids to feel powerful emotions, but not bleak enough for them to be seriously perturbed by the film. It's up to the adults who CAN register these subtle moods to pick up on this and start the discussion with their children about these very real mental illnesses."
TrueFilm,3ag0e5,hivejumper,16,Sat Jun 20 05:02:25 2015 UTC,"Where does Inside Out rank among Pixar's impressive oeuvre? How do Pete Docter's films (Monsters, Inc., Up, and now Inside Out) compare to the rest of the Pixar movies?   This is Pixar at its most emotionally resonant, not to mention its most animated anarchic.  As a whole, it's Top Five Pixar, that's for certain.  A demerit for the reaction of my kids, who liked it, but loved other Pixars higher.   What do you make of the movie's artistic representations of emotions? Why these specific five?   No qualms for these five, not much to say that hasn't been said elsewhere.  Curious to see what 27 emotions they initially had to work from.   Will this be a film that, in a way, revolutionizes the way children think about their emotions?   If my 8-year old children are any indication, no.  At least not yet.  At their age, they were confused and frightened by some of the more darker sequences.  However, I wonder if playability (which it certainly will have in our house) will be a factor, if we could use this as a reference point during specific milestones in their lives.   Does Inside Out signal a ""resurgence"" in a Pixar which has traditionally been perceived as ""floundering"" for the past couple of years?   Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes have already declared so.   What do you make of the intriguing casting-choices? (In particular, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, and Richard Kind)?   Not familiar with Phyllis Smith's work, nor Mindy Kaling (her TV show left me cold).  I know they were part of the Office, but I never watched that show either; again, its pilot left me cold.  So I take the fifth on that, except that they both did a fine job, but I can't compare with their other work.  Lewis Black was perfectly cast, although I don't know why they couldn't get a female to convey the angry emotions.  Same with Bill Hader.  The adults had all the same gender, Riley had mixed genders.  Plus, for all my appreciation of Black's work, it didn't convey anything Riley-ish.  Black's anger levels hit an 11, whereas when conveyed in Riley's face, it's more a 6-7.    Kind of interesting that they got the same girl who played ""Boo"" in Monsters, Inc to play Riley."

At their age, they were confused and frightened by some of the more darker sequences.   Do you think the complexity of the movie opens up room for dialogue with the little ones? The showing I went to had a family sitting in front of me with two girls around the same age (8 or so). I could tell that there would be many long discussions between them while on their way home (or at least when they watch again on DVD). The part where Joy was in the hall of memories and explaining that she didn't like messing up and only wanted the  best for Riley in everything she did, had the mom in tears. One of her daughters looked over and asked ""mommy are you ok? Why are you crying?"" To which the mom replied ""i'll explain later dear."" There were also other questions asked which the mom couldn't answer because it would take too long.  I'm not a parent but I can totally see how that scene could affect a mother on a level that a child would not understand. Not to say the kids didn't enjoy the movie, they certainly looked like they had a blast and laughed at all the funny parts. But I can definitely see the children liking it more after having certain layers of the movie fully explained to them.  The more I think about this film, the more i'm falling in love with it.

TrueFilm,3ag0e5,lvngandbrthngfilm,33,Sat Jun 27 04:18:15 2015 UTC,"Here's my hefty review for this. Part of it is just on Pixar bouncing back in general.   I am someone who has grown up on Pixar. Its films are probably some of the most integral films from my childhood. Toy Story was my first movie in theaters. I remember it fondly. I would even say it sparked my imagination and influenced much of it. A Bug's Life did much the same--the set design captivated me as a kid with the way they used objects that we disregard as important parts of their society. Toy Story 2 carried on the nostalgia from Toy Story, and Monsters Inc. almost helped me overcome my fear of my closet. It taught me that sometimes, things that seem scary aren't scary at all.  I was even afraid to go see it because there were monsters in it. (As a kid, I'd jump at just about anything.) Finding Nemo showed me an parents perspective on the world from the view of a clownfish.   And then came The Incredibles. Its what I consider one of the movies that changed everything for me. Everything from the storyline, to the characters, the editing, cinematography and music made me fully aware of everything that takes place in a movie. I also identified deeply with the character Violet, who was a character roughly my age and with my exact personality at the time. To this day, it holds a spot as one of my top three favorite films.   After that came films that were in my teens--Cars was fun, Ratatouille an amazing character piece, WALL-E a film that catered directly to me as it might as well been called Ben Burt's Robots. (I love the sound and droids of Star Wars). As we all know, Up was a tale on life slipping away too fast, and Toy Story 3 came out the year I graduated high school. The timing could not have been more appropriate and resonated more deeply. After Toy Story 3, if it weren't for the rash of lower reviews from critics I would surely question that perhaps I was outgrowing Pixar. What happened to the films that struck a chord with me? I entirely passed on Cars 2, and Brave was good, but felt more like a Disney movie to me. Monsters University was fun and again, aimed directly at my demographic, but I felt no real desire to ever watch it again.   Many doubted Pixar would ever recover, but I remembered back to the year 2010 where I took a look at several of Pixar's films in development. One was Newt--a film that I'm sad that will never happen. Another was The Good Dinosaur, due for release later this year and that sounded really intriguing. And the last one was one that really caught my attention. A film about the emotions inside a girl's head. Ever since then, I've been eagerly awaiting its release. I worried that Pixar would fail to deliver; that this could be a mediocre or poorly reviewed film, and after that it might just be enough for people to lose faith in the studio forever. But I didn't want Inside Out to just be a great film, I wanted it to be one that hit me on a personal level, one that made me look inside myself and learn something, or look back on something in my past. And that's exactly what it did.   The film opens on Riley being born. Joy is the first to arrive at the helm of Riley's mind, and its clear from the first moment that she loves to make Riley happy. But then Sadness shows up, and its obvious that the two will butt heads for the duration of the movie. It isn't even two minutes in to the film and I can already tell where things are headed. About 15 minutes in, Joy did something that confirmed my initial suspicions. She drew a circle around Sadness and told her to stay there.   Riley was repressing her feelings.   So at this point, Riley has arrived at her new home and tried hard to hold up under the stress of everything. Joy is doing her best to make sure of that. But that isn't necessarily a good thing--the other emotions aren't coping well with the extensive environmental change. Fear doesn't know what day to day life will bring anymore, Disgust hates the stuffy city, Sadness expects the worst, and Anger is straight up mad about the fact that they moved.   This is where the Pixar film does what I hoped it would do--it reigned me back into my childhood, but not in the way I expected. Many of us went to a new school in our lives, and if you didn't, you still probably switched from elementary to middle school and to high school. Its terrifying as a child. Its like your whole world is falling apart. Both for me and for the character Riley, this very much was a core memory. I was a tad older than Riley when I went from being homeschooled to entering the public school system. I was painfully shy and felt like a total social outcast. I even went days where I wouldn't say a word. My first day of public school is vivid in my memory--a rainy day (in Arizona, mind you) that felt like the end of my life. I might not have moved across the country as Riley did, but the feeling of being completely out of one's environment was captured perfectly in the scene--the emotions running amuck in her head, not knowing at all what to do or how to act. The scene instantly brought back this feeling for me. I knew exactly what Riley was going through.   This causes the emotions in her head to go into chaos, with a core memory now being one of sadness. Its at this point that Joy and Sadness, in their struggle, are sucked into a memory tube and carried out of Headquarters, leaving the other emotions to keep Riley going.   Its at some point in adolescence that we are thrust into an unfamiliar situation. Some have rougher childhoods than others, and some have better childhoods like Riley's. Loving parents, great friends, and a passion for something--Riley's being hockey. She is a kid that's had a fairly smooth life so far, and this is the first big bump in the road for her. As kids, with such little life experience, we don't know how to react, and like in Inside Out, we don't know how we're supposed to feel.   My middle school years were rough, and for me that snowballed into high school. I kept suppressing my own Sadness; thinking crying was a weakness and that I should always try to be happy. But by the time I realized I wasn't happy, I had become depressed. And I didn't feel anything at all anymore.   Riley is heading down much the same road through the rest of the movie, with the things that meant so much to her not seeming to matter anymore. One by one, the islands fall off. Goofball island, her sense of humor. She feels she's lost her friends, then her passion of hockey, her honesty, and lastly, her family. Throughout the film, it's basically a race against the clock for her emotions to save her before she falls into depression.   Its a horrifying moment when Anger, Disgust, and Fear realize that this is happening. Riley is feeling empty as she runs away from home, feeling she's lost everything that matters to her. But during their journey back to Headquarters, Joy has come to the revelation that Sadness does have a purpose. That during a stressful time, a person just needs to have a moment and be sad. Its not a bad thing--its a necessary thing. And that often in times of sadness, others will empathize and be there for the one who feels it.   Sometimes, as human beings, we need to cry.   As a kid, this can be hard to understand. It certainly was for me. As an adult looking back, I am reminded of the turmoil I felt as a child during my harder childhood moments. They aren't pleasant memories, but they have shaped who I am, and I am a stronger person because of it. Its part of growing up.   Pixar took a situation that is rather common and troublesome for kids, and turned it into a movie. And they did a damn good job.   Inside Out is one of those films where there's so much going on that I'll have to watch it multiple times to catch everything. I spent some time thinking how to approach a review, and I know I don't explore other parts of the movie much, but the movie as a whole was entertaining to me. I loved the humor--like Riley having earworm with the gum commercial song, or the more subtle things, like the newspapers Anger would read. The world building done inside Riley's mind was fantastic and complex. I felt as though I was seeing something I hadn't seen before. Lastly, Michael Giacchino did another amazing score for Pixar. He created yet another theme that in years will be nostalgic for me. Even in my review, I didn't even begin to cover the complexity of this movie. All in all, I'm happy to say that Pixar is back. I hope they have more films of this quality in the future. Not just great movies, but ones that people can connect with.   TL;DR: It perfectly captures the feeling of being a kid dealing with an unfamiliar or life changing situation. I was reliving the tougher parts of my childhood and teenage years during the whole movie. Pixar is back, guys."
TrueFilm,3ag0e5,mynameismarkcarlos,6,Sat Jun 20 06:22:39 2015 UTC,"Hey!! I had to suddenly change schools and move from Los Angeles, California to the hellhole that is Phoenix, Arizona during the middle of 6th grade and then had to change schools once more between middle to high school and then had to change my high school in Phoenix, Arizona when we moved BACK to the West Coast to reside in sunny Pasadena, California during the middle of sophomore year tooooooo!!  It's one of those movies whose narrative content is such that you're constantly drawing parallels to your own life as you watch it. I've only experienced that a handful of times (The Young Girls of Rochefort, Boyhood, and Tokyo Story immediately spring up to mind); usually the reflectin' takes place once the movie's over. Here, every movement invites immediate parallels to your own life and how you've lived it, emotion-wise.  Your insightful connection between Joy's circle-drawing to Riley's oppression of sas feelings makes me realize how truly subtle this movie is. Honestly, watching it again a second time was so much more enjoyable with the first, not the least of which is due to your knowledge of how the film transpires. Watching it a second time, your eyes are free to dart around the screen at will, and catch little throwaway lines or moments that you wouldn't have otherwise caught. One particularly amazing moment came during the opening pre-credits montage, where in a quick shot, Riley is revealed to be drawing Bing-Bong on the wall as she sings his theme song. In another great moment, the final emotion that Riley feels in the house sequence (when she's getting accustomed to the house) is Disgust. We only see a little green ball rolling along the conveyor belt, Joy sighs, and we're on to the next scene later that night. It's a brilliant way of showing how there are moments in life when one of these five emotions will take over at any given point, and that these are natural.  It also makes me think about how if this representation of emotions works without a ""normal"" child like Riley. Lots of people have criticized and will continue to criticize Riley for being generic and flavorless, with no personality. To that, I say:   This is a bold film, thematically. It's going for a lot of things. Give them a break, why dont'cha, in trying to set up the damn world in this first go-around. It makes it much easier if we have an everygirl (NOT an everyboy, mind you; an every-girl; Bravo, Docter and company, for going the Miyazaki route of feminism) to empathize with. One that isn't terribly complicated but who goes through awkward events, trial, and tribulations that MOST of us can relate to. She is a young girl. A pre-pubescent adolescent. Of course she's gonna be dull as rocks; she doesn't have any PERSONALITY yet. Hell, they even make a point about this in the opening montage which showcase the islands, where Joy quickly says, ""Well it ain't much..."" Yeah, damn right it ain't much; when one of your five key islands is Hockey Island, it doesn't give us much detail about that person's inner machinations or their desires beyond their penchant for the sport of hockey. She's only got four, but she has time to develop them. And you'll see, at the end of the film, when they flashforward, that Riley has an abundance of islands all over her brain. And she's still only 12. As Joy says, what could happen? (Of course, we all know the answer to that.)   Yes, she's a normal everygirl, but to briefly bring it back to my previous point, CAN these emotions be representative of those who are NOT feeling emotionally stable? Who are going through depression or even have suicidal thoughts? I believe that Docter and company allow for this possibility, since they hint of darker things at work in the psyche of Riley near the end of the film. When she gets on that damn bus, her whole mind-control-room stops working. Shuts down entirely. We cut back to Riley's face in close-up and, true to the very first question asked of us at the beginning (""You ever look at someone and wonder what they're thinkin'?""), we desperately want to know what she's thinking...if her emotions have been turned off. It seems to me like depression. Because Joy and Sadness are still not back, this cannot be attributed to mere melancholy that the Phyllis Smith character naturally brings about in the child. Everything is haywire, and Anger-Fear-Disgust are the only three emotions present in the control room. When it turns off, it seems, all of our perceptions of normal Riley turn off, too.   Likewise, at the beginning, when Sadness and Joy are fighting for control over the motherboard, Riley alternately feels emotions of blueness and happiness. When she's walking down some stairs, she stops herself from sliding down a bannister (because Sadness pushed the button) and then halfway down the stairs, she immediately perks up and slides down the bannister (because Joy pushed the button). If this isn't the slyest indication of bipolarism in a children's movie, I don't know what.   And we must remember: this all only starts to occur AFTER the move. Before this, Riley is relatively normal, with her periods of sadness supplied by Phyllis Smurf, sure, but overall Joy keeps her in balance. AFTER the move to San Francisco, however, the other emotions suddenly realize they have a voice and start speaking up. What happens in the real world? Riley, for the first time, faces an internal crisis: how will I get over this? It's enough of a jolting event to push her to the brink of something that goes beyond mere sadness. This may be the early stages of a kid who's bipolar, whose emotions are haywire (and NOT simply because of puberty; remember, the emotions don't even know what puberty is until the New Motherboard is installed in the control-room), and who doesn't know how to react in this situation.  It's what we both empathize with, it's what Docter and company flawlessly simplify into a children's movie of appropriate heft."
TrueFilm,3ag0e5,enzo32ferrari,7,Mon Jun 22 01:26:34 2015 UTC,"Ah, the California to Phoenix move. From the people I've know that have done that, its quite a rough one--especially as a kid.   I just saw Inside Out a second time yesterday, and I feel the same way as you. I also noticed her drawing Bing Bong on the wall, which I'd missed the first time as well. Its the little moments like that you catch on second viewings of Pixar films that make them so special.   I also agree that they went the proper route for a character. She's a kid with a great life and she's had a stable home environment and a sport that she loves. At age 11, thats what makes up the average kid. They have their family, friends, a quirk to their personality (her's being goofball), and an ethical trait that stands out--hers being her honesty. She also seems to have a sense of adventure--wanting to travel to the moon. So at age 11, yeah, thats pretty standard and easily relatable to most people in the audience, and great material to craft a story around. I imagine by the time she's 16, she'll have close to 15 islands or so. Who knows how many adults have?   I definitely agree they were alluding to depression when she shut down. People who have been through depression, myself included, know that depression isn't necessarily feeling sad, its feeling nothing--feeling empty. When they lost control of the board it was her slipping into it. And the way she was falling into it was very similar to how I fell into it--I didn't allow myself to feel sad. Luckily for Riley, Sadness got there in time, she realized her mistake, and she ran home to her parents and expressed her true feelings. I know the ways that people can fall into depression are all different, but the way Riley was shutting down was the exact same way I did; by trying to not feel what's considered a negative emotion, and in the process starting to not feel all of her other emotions.   Which is where I think your bipolar point is interesting. It didn't really strike me that way at all, but I think you're right about the staircase railing. I really got an entirely different message out of the film--kids are thrust into new, stressful situations, and they don't know how to feel in them. They are only aware of feeling so many ways, and they don't know at all how to respond or emote to what's in front of them, even when they aren't directly confronted with the situation. It has entirely jumbled how they feel about things in general.   But thats what makes this film so great. Its so interpretive and complex that we can all draw different conclusions on what exactly was going on inside her head."
TrueFilm,3ag0e5,mynameismarkcarlos,9,Mon Jun 22 02:29:23 2015 UTC,"Just got out of the theatre. Wow.  If films are empathy machines then Inside Out might be Pixar's best. Inside Out cements Pete Docter as Pixar's best director. Like Monsters, Inc. and Up, Inside Out shows Docter's remarkable imagination, his talent for building convincing worlds out of it, and his expansive sense of empathy. If someone would've told me I'd have cried more in another Pixar film than in the first ten minutes of Up I would've laughed at them. Who better to prove me wrong than the man who wrote and directed it?  I don't know why Docter chose the emotions he did, but if I were to take a stab at it, I'd say it was to drive each beat. At the highest level, Inside Out goes like this: Girl likes home. Girl moves away from home. Girl doesn't like new home. Girl tries to run away from new home to old home. Girl runs back to parents. If we were to understand what emotions drove this girl, Riley, what would they be? Well, if Riley likes her home, she's experiencing a positive emotion: joy. Because Riley is happy when we're introduced to her, Joy should be Riley's primary emotion. But what emotions would drive Riley's dislike for her new home? It wouldn't be Joy. But it'd be: Anger, Fear, Sadness. Out of all the emotions, Disgust doesn't seem to be the most obvious character, but she works, and I'm glad they had her.  I don't know if this film will revolutionize the way children think about their emotions. Will a four or five-year-old understand this film? How will they react when Bing Bong ""dies"" (this, by the way, was when I turned into a blubbering mess. My younger sister made fun of me for it)? But I think this film gives children more ways to communicate their emotions. That, if anything else, is vital.  And yet, I wouldn't say this is the beginning of Pixar's resurgence. The worst of Pixar is better than most live-action and animated films. The best of Pixar is better than the best of live-action and animated films. Their track record was too good. Something we likely aren't going to see for a long time, if ever again. But does it matter if, every few years, we get a film as remarkable as Inside Out? Won't Pixar still attract some of the best storytellers in the business, at the very least the best animators?"

TrueFilm,3ag0e5,tomsleeps,14,Thu Jul 9 22:21:40 2015 UTC,"I did not love Inside Out. I didn't hate it either. It fits solidly in the ""mediocre Pixar films"" in my book, nestled right between A Bug's Life and Brave. It had zero emotional resonance for me. The characters were so flat by their very essence. The emotions were all extremely one-note. (Except for maybe Joy? There was definitely something there. But imagine if all of the emotions had struggled with their purpose in Riley's brain.) Riley was the worst character. A mere shell to be controlled by the other flat characters.   What sucks is that I love the ideas in this movie. It would make a brilliant Pixar movie for them to deal with homesickness and changing emotions. This could have been great, but for me it just wasn't.   The animation was very well done but it was wasted for most of the movie on dull, repetitive, and unimaginative scenery.   And the plot. Jesus. That went beyond predictable. That was a movie that handed you a roadmap and followed it exactly all the way through. Not to mention that the exact same bridge-collapse scenario happened five times. Exactly the same way each time.  It wasn't creative. It was dull, lazy, and boring.   The clever wink-wink jokes got so old so fast. The pizza joke in Wall-E and the squirrel joke in Up are the cringiest jokes in those entire movies. Inside Out is a whole movie of them. It's constantly ""ah I see what you did there."" Or ""ah they lost their train of thought. Good one."" It's always going for a chuckle or a smirk. Never a belly laugh. And I can't even justify it as ""for the kids."" No kid laughed at that ""facts and opinions"" joke.   Inside Out wasn't the redemption of Pixar for me. It was the final nail in the coffin. I'm now thoroughly convinced that either Pixar doesn't know what made Toy Story and Finding Nemo and Wall-E great or they just don't give a shit anymore."
TrueFilm,3ag0e5,WeGottaGoFast1138,4,Sat Jun 20 00:10:47 2015 UTC,"While I really enjoyed inside out, and definitely thought is was up there with their better stuff, I totally agree with you about the jokes and plot lines. It got too consumed with its own cleverness, going out of its way to explain how this world is responsible for different thoughts in our head. Every joke was a ""see what you did there thing"" and while I thought a lot of them were funny, it also showed that the movie never outgrew its premise. Up is my favorite pixar film, and what I love about it is the premise (lets fly a house with balloons) is only the starting off point. The plot grows and develops in exciting ways independent of that premise. In inside out the movie never really becomes more than its premise, always falling back on clever jokes and revelations about how the mind works."
TrueFilm,3ag0e5,hivejumper,5,Tue Jun 23 03:00:11 2015 UTC,"Inside out felt like a return to form for Pixar. I wasn't that hyped going in but wanted to watch it again immidiately after coming out. I found the story structure to be all over the place, jumping between characters in the mind and the real world, which was refreshing. I think Pete Docter is just great at understanding his characters and their feeling during these extremely emotional beats. Just wanted to spread this awesome video of Pete Docter's student film and you'll see a lot of similarities to the  ""simple shape"" designs he uses. Squares for Carl, Sully, and Anger while the circle can be attributed to Ellie, Mike Wazowski and sadness. It's great to see Pete Docter's work over the years were he's repeating himself in someways but always pushing in a new and fresh direction. Inside out and monsters both have the vast world that we as viewers need to grasp the rules of.   Here's the student film: www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGyE4d2dG34"
TrueFilm,3ag0e5,lordhadri,11,Tue Jun 23 14:59:18 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, this movie is right up there with Up as one of the great Pixar movies; a true return to form. Second, I'm an adult and I can't stop getting out of my head the idea of these characters controlling my decisions.

TrueFilm,3ag0e5,zackmanze,3,Fri Jun 19 22:26:07 2015 UTC,"Hahaha that's hilarious.   I had a ""God Dammit"" moment as well. But it happened before the movie even started. About 3/4ths of the way through LAVA (the short at the beginning), I started tearing up and then gave up trying to hold back the tears. After the short ended I let out a sigh along with ""God Dammit Pixar."" I mean, the movie hadn't even started yet and they had me an emotional mess. The couple next to me overheard and chuckled between the sniffles also. That's when I knew I was in for a treat even before the movie itself started."
TrueFilm,3ag0e5,PrecisionEsports,6,Fri Jun 19 22:59:34 2015 UTC,"There is one thing about this movie, story-wise, that troubled me! Joy learns something about sadness, but I don't think the same happens in reverse. We see that other people have a different one of these five aspects in control; Joy presumably continues being the dominant emotion of Riley's mind. So maybe Joy has learned the role of Sadness, but has RIley herself learned why she can't be happy all the time? If we look past the uplifting and humorous tone of the movie to consider the implications of our brains being operated by independent beings that can come in conflict with each other this becomes worrisome. This story has no room for the 'dark side' of Joy, the kind that self-medicates and doesn't simply tolerate Sadness without knowing her purpose but is endlessly at war with her.   I also haven't decided yet if it's really true that part of maturity is the formation of 'mixed emotions' and accepting them into your personality. Sure nostalgia and irreversible trauma set in as you get older no matter who you are but that' not what the movie is about."
TrueFilm,3ag0e5,Sadsharks,9,Wed Jun 24 22:16:11 2015 UTC,"Joy learns something about sadness, but I don't think the same happens in reverse.    It occurs to me that Sadness is already aware of her own importance, perhaps coming to this realization even earlier than Joy. When Sadness rebels against Joy's attempts to keep her inside the circle (again, as another poster has said, a clever way of indicating Riley's active repression of melancholia), when Sadness constantly touches the balls of memory and turns them permanently blue: these, to me, don't seem like totally ignorant whoopsidaisies on Sadness's part. Phyllis Smith sounds surprised when it happens, but it's only because the specific consequences of Sadness's ball-touching NEVER happened before in Riley's mind before; but what she shows NO surprises or hesitations towards is, quite frankly, her fuckin' job. She's SUPPOSED to make sure Riley balances out the periods of happiness with the periods of sadness; she must press the button occasionally; and somewhere during Riley's maturation, she realizes she must affect other memories as well. She can detect when something big is going to go down, and she has the great instinct to tell when she must step in. The other emotions don't realize this, because, like Joy, they think that Riley must always be happy too. They realize how much power Sadness wields (remember, Anger, Disgust, or Fear can't turn the balls-of-memory into their respective colors; only Sadness and Joy can) and they try to actively repress it. The other four emotions are immature, young, bratty, inexperienced; they haven't wisened, but Docter and company suggest that it's Sadness, the EMOTION of melancholy, that matures first. That's a pretty bold suggestion, imo, because it says that from the very beginning, we're subconsciously instilled with a sense that the dark times will come. We're not primed to mature our Happiness meters; we think those will happen forever.   This isn't a story about sadness learnin' somethin' about herself. This is mainly an exploration of the limits of happiness, this is 100% Joy's journey.  Also, I think there's something to be said about the ingenuous levels that THIS particular children's movie works on. This is a movie that many people have criticized for being ""routine"", ""predictable"", ""lazy"". To a certain (infinitesimally small) degree, they're right. We've seen this type of movie before. And the central plot--a kid runs away from her home, and then comes back once she realizes it's wrong--is so meatless and paper-thin, you sort of do a double take when you realize that what the movie makes you think is complex is actually pretty simple. But this actually works to the film's benefit and what its ending line implies: that this is only the beginning. This story will be remembered by grown-up Riley as one filled with dreamy roses compared to the future traumas she will most definitely face. That Inside Out has been described as a non-story may be the very reason why it works so brilliantly. Of course, nothing much happens; the kid's only 12, and we're dealing with a relatively normal kid. Running-away (and in such a trumped-up dramatic manner as the film makes it out to be) will not seem so bad in the future. When Joy repeats her question from the beginning, ""Riley's now 12. What could happen?"", something lurches in our stomachs. EVERYTHING can happen, and the fact that we're not being given access to ANY hints on what can occur in Riley's life is troubling to adults, to say the least. To a kid (who, by the way, are the people this movie's being sold to; what we think is beside-the-point), to a kid who's watching Inside Out, it'll be just like all the other Pixar movies: fun, colorful, exciting, filled with action and sad scenes, but overall happy ending yayyyyy!!! Right? It's a children's movie at the end of the day, and it can only hint/suggest at darker events (we don't want to traumatize the kiddies). But Docter and company do some damn good suggesting."
TrueFilm,3ag0e5,PrecisionEsports,2,Wed Jun 24 01:32:57 2015 UTC,"Where does Inside Out rank among Pixar's impressive oeuvre? How do Pete Docter's films (Monsters, Inc., Up, and now Inside Out) compare to the rest of the Pixar movies?   I think it is one of Pixar's best films, ranking below only the Toy Story trilogy and my two favorite films from them, WALL-E and Ratatouille. Docter's films are certainly significant in the company's oeuvre, not the absolute best but certainly better than some (Cars, Cars 2, Brave, etc.).   What do you make of the movie's artistic representations of emotions? Why these specific five?   I felt the way they represented each emotion was very clever. Joy was glowing, bright and yellow with big blu eyes. Sadness was lumpier and blue. Anger was square, stout and red. Disgust was green and always had a look of disdain. Fear was skinny, hunched-over and wide-eyed. I thought all of these designs were very appropriate. These five emotions are the most important to our personalities and attitudes. They also demonstrate the importance of each one in daily life.   Will this be a film that, in a way, revolutionizes the way children think about their emotions?   Yes, children will realize more that emotions generally perceived as bad, such as anger, disgust and especially sadness, are actually very important. They each have important qualities. Joy gives you an optimistic look on life and sadness can help you make decisions and learn from them through regret and remorse. Anger gives you a way to react to frustrating situations and both fear and disgust keep you away from dangerous encounters.    Does Inside Out signal a ""resurgence"" in a Pixar which has traditionally been perceived as ""floundering"" for the past couple of years?   Yes. After the release of the outstanding Toy Story 3, which was nominated for Best Picture, in 2010, the company has released multiple films which have been generally viewed as either mediocre or downright terrible. These include Cars 2 in 2011, which I did not see but has gotten mainly negative reviews and is the only film that is rotten on Rotten Tomatoes, Brave in 2012, which I thought was pretty dull and Monsters University, which was, in my opinion, an unnecessary film with no importance to the film from which it is based, Monsters, Inc. Inside Out shows Pixar can be original and still succeed without having to make sequels and prequels to get along, shown by the fact that Inside Out has broken the record held by Avatar: the biggest global box office weekend of an original film, one not based on previous source material.   What do you make of the intriguing casting-choices? (In particular, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, and Richard Kind)?   I thought the casting was pitch perfect in this film, especially the roles mentioned. Phyllis Smith's voice was the perfect representation of Sadness and helped with the personification of the emotion. Lewis Black was also great as Anger and gave great comedic relief to the film. Richard Kind voiced Bing Bong with heart, humor and, eventually, heart-breaking acceptance of his fate of being forgotten.  Overall, this film was absolutely fantastic and a must-see for anyone and everyone."

Nothing by Bergman.    https://www.fandor.com/  Another option is MUBI.  Wide variety, lots of contemporary foreign films. Kurosawa - Dreams, and a doc about Kurosawa.

Doing a very lazy Kurosawa search (https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kurosawa), I come up with Scandal, The Idiot, The Quiet Duel, and Madadayo, all here on the channel Akira Kurosawa (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwLU1OBXIodt-ltDAbUe-zw).  Search for specifics films and you might find even more.  Bergman search comes up with a great deal as well."

Best for classic films is probably mubi, which is nice, but if you know how it works, you'll see it's not really perfect.  Best way, then, is blu-rays. You have full be a bit careful you don't get a shit one, but they are usually good.  Outside of that though, only reliable way is... Well, I think you know. It's a shame, but yeah, pirating is by far the most reliable way. The thing that bugs me the most is that even with a region-free blu-ray player, pirating has give me quality I can't buy - because Criterion actually fucked up the Yojimbo release (wrong aspect ratio, bad boosting), so the best release is the toho release, but guess what? No English subs. But there's a version you can download that is the Togo video synced with the Criterion subs! Brilliant."

Growing up, this and You Only Live Twice were the two bond movies I watched the most, so it holds a special place in my bond world.  I was surprised to see that it ranked so low on your scores thus far (Wikipedia shows an average consensus of about 12th overall in the series, although their critique was on par with yours).  I need to go back and watch it again to see how much I'm influence by nostalgia.  Thanks again!"
TrueFilm,3ae81x,mealsharedotorg,12,Fri Jun 19 13:53:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words!  And I think there are a couple of factors here relating to your comment.  I was surprised too because it really isn't a bad film.  It's just that the films that have been far worse than it so far (Moonraker, MWTGG, LALD) have all had some pretty redeeming qualities.  The other thing is that even those films I listed above were bad, but not bad bad.  Apart from Diamonds, we haven't really hit the bottom of the barrel yet.  The remaining Moore films plus one or two of the Brosnan films are likely going to rank below it, so when it all shakes out in the end, there's a good chance that this one may end up being closer to the middle."

I know I've seen all of the Bond films but I don't feel qualified to comment simply because I've never viewed them critically. And I've never sat down to watch some of them in a row, let alone all of them. I'm not even certain I've seen all of them as an adult. Like with the last two, The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only are my nostalgic favorites simply because I remember seeing them in the theater when I was young and impressionable. (I even have a fondness for Moonraker recognizing that some of it is simply awful.)  So I enjoy reading someone else's critiques and impressions of the movies and the effort your efforts here, even if I don't think I have much to say.  And I'm getting a double dose of this because a contributer to The Mary Sue is also reviewing all of the Bond films."

It's hard for me to judge FYEO or almost any movie of that era because it was released when I was about 12 and my ability to discern quality wouldn't arrive for a few years; but the ability of various undoubtedly lousy movie to wiggle their way into ""beloved"" status in my brain was in full flower. Even the theme song, which let's be honest, is god damned awful, and certainly no ""goldfinger"" or ""the spy who loved me""... but my brain still tries to tell me I kind of like it.  I think I can be much more rational about the Connery films and any Bond film after about 86... but it's hard for me to judge most of those Moore movies. That said, I can't say I disagree with much of what you have to say here.  But I will tell you one thing that I absolutely love this movie for; putting the Meteora monasteries of Greece on my bucket list. I remember vividly that year watching that movie and seeing that monastery on that rock and deciding ""someday I'm gonna visit that place"". (haven't made it there yet, but someday it will happen!)"

What I'm finding to be exceptionally fascinating is that it is becoming more and more frequent with each review I do.  And it makes sense.  I'm getting to the point where the movies I'm reviewing were being released in the '80s so more and more Redditors grew up watching them.  When I did Dr. No, nobody was talking about how they saw it in theaters in 1962 and remember it fondly for that reason.    And I truly hope you make it to Meteora someday!  The locations look gorgeous."
TrueFilm,3ae81x,TriumphantGeorge,6,Fri Jun 19 23:35:48 2015 UTC,"I can't really comment on the technical aspects of the film and have to rewatch all the films with a more critical eye but I have always loved the plot of FYEO.  I like how it scales down from some huge world crisis to simply retrieving the ATAC.  The scene between Moore and General Gogol at the end with the line about detente is great.    I think the exotic locations in FYEO are used very well.  The retrieval and underwater fight between Bond and the henchman in the huge atmospheric diving suit always felt extremely tense and claustrophobic.  The climb up to the monastery is impressive and a beautiful location.  The ski chase can get a little campy but is a lot of fun and the Lotus exploding unceremoniously and the ensuring car chase in Italy is also very entertaining.    While Bibi is at a Mary Goodnight level of annoying, Moore's line about putting on clothes and buying her an ice cream helps make up for it.  I also quite like the actor who plays Colombo, the scenes with him and Moore on his boat and the raid on the warehouse were both great.  Love his use of pistachios to give away the enemies movement.  Your reviews have inspired me to re-watch the series for the first time in years so thank you for doing this."

Thought it was ponderous and didactic, with the thumping heavy-handed Hollywood white Jesus (ok, Moses) message. Have to appreciate the sets and vast crowd scenes, defining 'epic'. Certainly worth seeing, but I won't be rushing for a rewatch"

Blockbusters nowadays feel so small in scale. ""Transformers""? Gimme a break. That isn't big; THIS IS BIG."
TrueFilm,3acxjd,lordhadri,16,Fri Jun 19 02:24:23 2015 UTC,"One thing I take away from the pieces of Verbinski's work that I've seen is that he pushes his films as far as they'll go. Though that's not necessarily always a good thing.  Mouse Hunt is weird, but the over the top nature of the action is really fun and supported by the performances. It's almost like watching a live action Tom and Jerry cartoon. I have fond memories of watching it at release, and this thread makes me want to sit down with it again.  Pirates of the Caribbean has no right to be as good as it is really, but the performances, the big action set pieces, the visual design, and the screenplay all go a step further than you expect and make the film a great piece of family action adventure. They aren't just evil pirates after their stolen treasure, they're undead evil pirates trying to lift the curse the treasure placed on them. It takes all the cliche's and builds out from them to find interest.  As an animated feature Rango might be one of the most impressive visuals I've ever seen. I never understood why the aesthetic of the film wasn't discussed more at it's release. The first time Rango goes into the saloon, that lighting is some of the most striking I've ever seen on a screen, live action or animated. It's another very odd film, and I get why it might not connect with a wide audience, but everything about it is pushed about as far as it can go, including the meta references to the Western genre.   Even The Lone Ranger goes way beyond what you would expect from the source material. Tonto is an unreliable narrator with a guilty conscience illustrating a much more brutal and grim world than I think anyone expected. He isn't just a largely silent sidekick there to support the lead, he's a complex character with distinct motivation. Hammer's Ranger isn't the do-good Mary Sue you could expect either. He has complex motivations and depth. The native American people in the film aren't played as simple or basic either, they aren't just the archetypal Noble Savage character you might expect. Is the film too long? Yeah, probably by about 50%. But I don't think that's why it failed. I think it was too complicated and well developed for its own good. People expected a largely black and white, good vs evil, pistols at high noon type of film and instead got nearly three hours of strongly directed violence and reflection on might vs right.   Is Verbinski overlooked? I don't know. Depends on who you ask I guess. I mean, they gave him two sequels to Pirates, two hundred million dollars to make The Lone Ranger, and a Best Animated Feature Oscar for Rango, so it's hard to say he hasn't had a fair run in the industry, On the other hand I doubt you'll see him in many top ten director lists, or mentioned too often alongside Kubrick or Spielberg, but I'm not sure he's really earned that type of recognition. I'd probably categorise him as more ""under-appreciated"" than ""over looked""."
TrueFilm,3acxjd,Mankyspoon,5,Fri Jun 19 04:59:06 2015 UTC,"That's what I mean really. His career is very successful, he just never had a moment where he was hyped up as some kind of action movie genius. That happens all the time for creators of lesser films. At this point he's made enough to back up a case for being one of the few great director of blockbusters, and it's obvious how essential his writing was to making them what thy are; most such movies are written by hacks.  But:   he pushes his films as far as they'll go. Though that's not necessarily always a good thing.   Absolutely right. Michael Bay will give you babes and dancing robots because that's what he's interested in too. Verbinski goes harder at making his movies thematically interesting, but doesn't always succeed at making it fit together well. (All the complaints about the humor in the otherwise agonizingly grim The Lone Ranger. Two personalities.) He's a weird middle ground between Bay and James Cameron there, but is also distinct from both of them instead of just another copycat of either.  Armie Hammer has to believe he's a Mary Sue-ish character to gain The Lone Ranger's powers. I loved that."

TrueFilm,3acxjd,tuningproblem,3,Fri Jun 19 03:50:57 2015 UTC,"Even with the resurgence of Cage fandom I never heard much about The Weather Man. It must be overshadowed by Lord of War, which came out around the same time. I'm sure it's better than The Wicker Man though."

All of the American remakes from that region are horrible. We got amazing masterpieces such as these coming as a result (the originals for the most part are pretty good):   One Missed Call Pulse Grudge The Eye Shutter Dark Water    Fun Fact: The director of Ringu was the one who made the sequel to Verbinski's Ring. The one infamous for the badly CGI'd deer. Spoiler The Ring Two is atrocious.   Also if anyone could tell me how Uninvited was it would be very appreciates.

I think it's a testament to his direction to coerce such a nuanced performance from Cage, whose performances can get out of hand without strong direction.   The first Pirates movie is home to Depp's unforgettable performance, and though further movies devolved into the absurd, Captain Jack's first onscreen performance was inspired."
TrueFilm,3acxjd,mynameismarkcarlos,3,Fri Jun 19 03:59:30 2015 UTC,"Do yourself a favor and watch The Weatherman.  A Steven Conrad script directed by Gore Verbinski.  That's a hell of a pair right there.  I don't find it mid-life crisis as much as it's mid-life awakenings.    Spoilers  Dave, in search of finding his own identity from lack of finding it through his twenties and thirties, tries to adopt his father's model.  i.e. Achieve respect through work status and reputation.  He thinks if he lands a national weatherman spot it'll solve all his problems.  His focus on this directly affects the people in his life that he's subconsciously neglecting.  I think he's a good guy but the way in which he went about things through the first half was so half-assed that there was no other outcome for his family than for it to fall apart.  I think he thinks he can coast in his personal life like he does in his work life and all will be well.  He even mentions the perks of his work.  He even mentions the perks of what will become his new job and he takes it anyway.  I think he thought the only way he could ever make his father proud is if he were to emulate him and not carve out his own path.  He tries so hard - in certain ways - to emulate his father but he can't because I don't think it's in him to do it.  I don't think he was ever meant to be a family man.  I don't think that's where he was ever going to find his own identity.   After he breaks down in the car and admits to his father that he ""can't knuckle down"" his father offers him practical advice and admits that being an author is ""just what I do.""  ""I've practiced and I've gotten good.""  No more, no less.    I think his father's admittance to what his life was whittled down to spurs Dave's decision as to what he's good at.  ""I remember once imagining what my life would be like, what I'd be like. I pictured having all these qualities, strong positive qualities that people could pick up on from across the room. But as time passed, few ever became any qualities that I actually had. And all the possibilities I faced and the sorts of people I could be, all of them got reduced every year to fewer and fewer. Until finally they got reduced to one, to who I am. And that's who I am, the weather man.""   He found what he was good at and stuck with it.  It takes the whole movie for him to come to terms about being okay with it.  To be okay with being Dave and never being Robert.  Trying to please your parents or make them think that you were worth it is a universal black hole in each of us.  I think we all feel that we never really get it quite the way we envision it."
TrueFilm,3acxjd,II_Productions,3,Fri Jun 19 08:31:55 2015 UTC,"The Pirates sequels were films I hated growing up, and because I was quite vocal about it, a lot of my friends thought I was annoying. To be honest, I understand that. Vocal teenagers are annoying.  But, regardless of the Pirates sequels' themes, the films aren't well written. Set pieces hop from MacGuffin to MacGuffin, which would be okay if the films' characters developed and drove subsequent plot points, but they don't, and because of that, these films drag for their entire running times.  Verbinksi is at the height of his powers with Rango. It's fun, idiosyncratic, and thematically heavy. It cost $135mil, so I wonder if its relatively small budget and Bruckheimer's absence allowed him to clarify his vision.  But for him to be overlooked, his films would either have to make little to no money, or his films would have to receive little critical acclaim. That simply isn't the case. While The Lone Ranger was a box office bomb, the Pirates trilogy is one of the most successful franchises of all time. The first Pirates film, as you noted, received a lot of critical acclaim. And while Rango didn't make as much money as the Pirates trilogy, it was a box office and critical success. People, casual movie goers in particular, know he's a talented director. But his talents shine when he's restrained."
TrueFilm,3acxjd,ghiju123,8,Fri Jun 19 14:09:06 2015 UTC,"He's one of my favourite directors. Rango and The Lone Ranger are two of my favourite films, and I rewatched At World's End the other day to see if, out of context, I could see a single story in it, and I did. At World's End was always the Pirates film I enjoy because it's insane, just like sea-faring tales of yore, but having now worked some on the other side of the camera, there are parts where it seems they didn't know what they were doing, hence the huge amount of exchanges and double crosses and deals, but other than that, it's a story of piracy vs law, the underdog vs big business. A favourite of mine, sure, but not necessarily the best movie ever made.  I feel desperately sad at The Lone Ranger's reception. It's a fantastic film, Armie Hammer is great as the title character even though it's told through Tonto's perspective.  Rango is truly, truly brilliant exercise in self, in character, an examination on the Western genre (if you can't tell I'm a big Western fan) and is truly respectful of the Western genre.  I personally don't think Verbinski can do wrong, and he's a filmmaker whose films I will always watch and enjoy."

TrueFilm,3acxjd,poliphilo,5,Fri Jun 19 05:27:12 2015 UTC,"wonderful post. when i saw the lone ranger, i was shocked at how dismal the reviews were: i thought it was fantastic and one of the few movies in the Western genre that doesn't shy away from the sins this country committed in the name of manifest destiny. The end sequence on the train, I would argue, is one of the best action sequences ever put on the silver screen. From the time it begins to it's conclusion, you're just fucking hooked: it's that good. The only thing I would have changed was the awkward framing device with Tonto in the museum; without it, it might be up there as one of my favorite movies.  I think when you give Verbinski total control over something weird and wacky (ie. Rango) he really shines. I would also say perhaps its the Disney marketing team that doesn't know what to do with him? I don't blame them; after all, he comes off as a mainstream David Lynch, churning out big-budget Blue Velvets one after the other. I would love to see one of his smaller film really take off and get some Oscar love."
TrueFilm,3acxjd,zackmanze,3,Fri Jun 19 05:38:45 2015 UTC,"Rango's Oscar win is probably all we can hope for, but it was well deserved, even if it wasn't given for the right reasons.   I think Tonto in the museum is fine, it lets you know you're watching a story, and if you take it that way it makes a lot more sense. Not all movies admit that. It's weird when critics (in consensus at least) dismiss something that should have been taken more seriously. I think the problem with trying to make a good commercial blockbuster is that if it fails with audiences everyone feels safe in assuming it wasn't any good anyway. And for some reason a western is an even bigger gamble these days than a nautical movie, though maybe not as bad as a SciFi movie set on Mars. (Another kind of western.) Watch Ridley Scott not succeed in turning that around."

I think it will be pretty successful."
TrueFilm,3acxjd,WuzzupMeng,2,Sat Jun 20 05:44:50 2015 UTC,"Good post. With Mouse Hunt, I found Verbiniski very much a talent to watch. I think he delivered on his promise in the first Pirates movie (the others have some good bits too), which I think is just a captivating, beautifully paced, action adventure with great turns from Depp, Rush, and Knightley. Really effective tone—it's funny and enjoyable even though real problems are at stake.  I find two trends worrisome in the more recent films: (1) physical comedy which is unrealistic—and therefore basically unfunny, and (2) quoting other films. These problems, especially the second, even took away some from my enjoyment of Rango (though that film does have many merits too).  The Mexican is interesting; it was originally planned as a quirky indie film starring (very minor stars at the time) Owen Wilson and Renee Zellwegger; various maneuvering resulted in A-listers Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt instead. I thought the film that they ended up with basically didn't work; the leads' (and Gandolfini's) star power and familiarity overwhelm the very light premise, threat level, and thematic ambition. But, despite being disappointing in many ways, there's some good work in it, including some nice visuals. First collaboration, I think, between Verbinski and Dariusz Wolski (previously of The Crow and Dark City), and a good start to a good collaboration over many films."
TrueFilm,3acxjd,white_water,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:58:54 2015 UTC,"(1) physical comedy which is unrealistic—and therefore basically unfunny, and (2) quoting other films.    I know what you mean and there's an example from The Lone Ranger that sums up both. A minor character dies and takes a long time to roll down a hill, something that happened in the same location in Man of the West. So I got it, but that's a weird movie to use as an influence on something called The Lone Ranger, and it doesn't even work as an in-joke. It gave me a clue that the movie was supposed to be the way it was but it didn't make it any more enjoyable. I think it still could have done what it did and been more like the great last 20 minutes; Rango pretty much succeeded there, probably because as an animated children's movie it needed to be short."

We've had too many posts about directors like Kurosawa and The Coen Bros that give a nice overview and analysis of their work before. I'd prefer the sub not to be saturated with this kind of broad analysis and instead focus on smaller things, scenes or characters or devices, that really add to the conversation instead of just echoing it."

TrueFilm,3acxgn,ChrimDeep,21,Fri Jun 19 02:23:40 2015 UTC,"Really, the only way to really tell is to watch them for yourself.  I love Bergman personally, and films such as Persona, Cries and Whispers, and Fanny and Alexander all are really more emotional films (although certainly are bearing existential themes as well).  Quite frankly, I think you're over-thinking the idea of an opinion being shoved down your throat.  Bergman is hardly the kind of figure to force his themes in your face, but the themes are certainly there.  Then again, just because he tells a certain idea about life doesn't mean you have to agree with it whatsoever.  It seems like you're concern is that you think you're going to be conditioned into thinking something different than what you currently think, which isn't what would happen.  But he'll give you things to think about, for sure - it's up to you whether they have credence."
TrueFilm,3acxgn,afewthoughtsonfilm,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:34:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right.  I think I was maybe a bit afraid to and wanted some padding.  Like, if Bergman was this cruel person, maybe I could hear from people saying it's not so bad.  I'll give it a go."
TrueFilm,3acxgn,afewthoughtsonfilm,2,Fri Jun 19 22:54:38 2015 UTC,"If you've seen The Seventh Seal and liked it, then I wouldn't worry, of what I've seen, it's the most existentialist.  But he's a wonderful, wonderful filmmaker and made films about a variety of topics, so you're sure to find some you like that have nothing to do with those themes (or, at least, not quite anyway)."
TrueFilm,3acxgn,kotomine,12,Sat Jun 20 02:12:25 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I see Bergman's films as primarily emotional experiences, not intellectual ones.  Whether or not Bergman has an intellectual agenda (I don't think that's really the case) his films are things of beauty, and I see the underlying philosophy in his films as mostly a vehicle for this.  I'm not really clear on the division here, actually.  I'm not sold on the idea that there's a difference between merely experiencing this or that and being directed towards specific thoughts.  If you don't think his films will contaminate your mind (and I don't see why they would or why you would think that), what is the harm in watching a few more and seeing for yourself?  I think you're the sort of person that would get a lot out of watching a lot more Bergman (definitely look at Persona, as it is my favorite of his), and I would encourage you to continue to explore his filmography.  Even your thoughts about why you appreciate film seem to reinforce this: Bergman tends strongly towards the oneiric."
TrueFilm,3acxgn,rinikoolhof,2,Fri Jun 19 03:58:06 2015 UTC,"I had a very nice experience watching The 400 Blows.  The boy was being driven away from his home to go to boarding school or something like that, and he's looking at the streetlights passing by and there's just such a levity to it that's so beautiful to me.  I would say that is an experience.  Being presented with thought, or even neurosis in the case of Woody Allen or Bergman with a fear of death and questioning God's existence, is also just an experience, you are right.  But it's a more of a specialized one.  To me it's not as big.  Not as beautiful to me.  But I think I oughta give it a go."
TrueFilm,3acxgn,eliphas_levi,10,Fri Jun 19 22:47:51 2015 UTC,"You're main proposition here is that Bergman's point of view is deeply entrenched within his films, but too overtly, and that you don't enjoy that point of view.   Bergman stated that he had “a need to influence other people, to touch other people both physically and mentally, to communicate with them. Movies, of course, are a fantastic medium through which to touch other human beings, to reach them, to annoy them, to get them to think. To get them started emotionally. That’s the truest, deepest reason why I make films"". He is a thematic director, frequently delving in to matters of the psyche, the societal role of the artist and the existence of God.   Consciousness and thought, as you have divided them, seem to represent the visceral experience of watching the film and the thematic message within the text from a viewers point of view, rather than from their origin of creation. I believe these are not mutually exclusive, and the best films blend the two seamlessly for viewers. You said you enjoyed David Lynch, and Mulholland Drive is a great example of this, showing us the visceral experience of Naomi Watts' character's own dreaming and waking life in order to elucidate the ways in which humans blend the two.   Bergman similarly is able to dramatize his ideas, presenting his fears of death during his time spent resting over 1957 due to stomach illnesses in the forms of The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries.   You said you enjoyed film because it allowed you to dive in to the psyche of someone and experience their dream. Bergman offers his films up as a way to explore and connect through the shared experiences of life, meditating on matters from the experiences of himself and those around him and sharing them with others: his christian upbringing, his life and upbringing in the arts and his relationship with his dutious mother and ecclesiastical father.   Bergman films run the gamut of style, ranging from the pessimistic and emotionally burdensome (Cries and Whispers) to the fanciful, enjoyable and relatively optimistic (Fanny and Alexander).  So really what I'm trying to say is: I disagree when you say that Bergman is overly forceful with point of view in the films. He crafted films from the experiences of those around him that range vastly in tone. I'm sure you can find some films of his that are more towards your inclinations. Again if you like Lynch you should check out Persona as Kotomine suggested, a dreamy journey into the psyche.    If you're looking for help enjoying his work, maybe starting somewhere like Fanny and Alexander. A story of a young boy growing up in Sweden at the turn of the 20th Century, something a little lighter that Linklater stated was one of the major influences for Boyhood, and maybe a good place to start.   In saying that, being open to the differing opinions and styles that every film and filmmaker has to offer is half the fun of being a film nerd. Start at the suggestions and keep heading down the rabbit hole. Bergman is a good place to start to get deep in to Fellini, Antonioni, Woody Allen and others."
TrueFilm,3acxgn,abrightersummerday,0,Fri Jun 19 06:40:33 2015 UTC,"I'm terrified to watch Persona.  I love Lynch's nightmares, but there's such a heart there, and fantastic humor behind everything.  There's a knowing compassion behind a lot of his stuff.  If Persona was this REAL serious pill designed to make me forget warmth forever, I think I'd stay away.  I'm sensitive!"
TrueFilm,3acxgn,pulpwoods,7,Fri Jun 19 22:57:34 2015 UTC,"Persona is a mildly uncomfortable film to watch but it's by no means a nightmare. I personally feel a lot of ""heart"" in Bergman's films, he's a very intimate filmmaker, possibly because he puts a lot of his own thoughts and experiences into his films."
TrueFilm,3acxgn,89bottles,5,Sat Jun 20 00:34:03 2015 UTC,"I have seen The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries, and I actually enjoyed them.   I don't get it. What are you afraid of? This post would make a lot more sense to me if you hadn't enjoyed his films... Every movie has a viewpoint; even films of ""pure consciousness."" What directors are you even talking about? It might help if you said something about which movies/directors you do like, because the way you describe film only sounds 50% right, and 50% like nothing that actually exists.  Ingmar Bergman isn't going to brainwash you against your will. If you've liked his films, then trust your own feeling and don't project some external criteria of ""opinionlessness"" as your preferred movie-going experience."
TrueFilm,3acxgn,bluedays,2,Sat Jun 20 00:10:32 2015 UTC,"Talking only out of my one perspective, being a Swede too and inherently sharing many of his views, I think its completely absurd to neglect Bergman out of fright for his agenda. When I watch Bergman films I can't really sense that he is forcing me to think a certain way about a certain subject. As the other commenters say in this thread I agree Bergman is essentially emotional. Of course there is heavy themes and difficult dilemmas embedded in his films, but the ones that I love the most (The Hour of the Wolf, Persona, Fanny and Alexander) are so ambivalent in their execution that its almost impossible to feel that a certain view is being forcefully imposed on you. There is som many possible interpretations of every frame, plot and narrative structure that I feel more secure watching his films than some Hollywood spectacle action filled with consumerist and capitalist ideology.   I hope you try out his films and come to your own conclusion!"

TrueFilm,3a919t,kowalski71,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:41:19 2015 UTC,"You have to take into account too that fans of TV are some of the most spoiler-adverse people around. They are probably staying away from these general TV subs because they don't want to discuss any series unless they've seen all of it.   Not that we don't have our share of spoilerphobes here, but as /u/lordhadri pointed out below, at least with film there is a canon of discussion which most of us are familiar with, and any new entries to the canon (even recent blockbusters) are easy for us to catch up with."
TrueFilm,3a919t,wmille15,2,Fri Jun 19 05:52:20 2015 UTC,"That and spoilers don't seem to matter much to movies outside of a few types that rely on plot twists or advancing a bigger story, and even then mostly when they're brand new. I think television is what largely drives how people think about spoilers.   It does seem that internet television communities are mostly about congregating after you've finished the latest episodes but do you really think that keeps people from discussing TV series in general? I hadn't thought of that. We should want a place where someone could discuss The Sopranos as they please without fear of fandom backlash but the smaller number of people who know the show well is definitely a limiter."

It was also a slow burn kind of thing with murders to be solved, so there was time and opportunity for interesting speculation.    Btw, The Killing was beautifully shot and it never seems to get mentioned with the other tv shows that are more cinematic looking.  (Probably, again, because it wasn't too widely seen.)

TrueFilm,3a919t,pursehook,2,Thu Jun 18 21:23:52 2015 UTC,"It's funny you should mention Mad Men, that was the main one which came to mind as disappointing me while writing my comment. It's one of the ones I unsubscribed from because I felt that everything posted while the season was on-air, particularly the surge after the new episode aired each week, was vacuous crap. Mad Men is the closest to literature I've ever seen in a TV show, layers of symbolism, literary techniques used in the writing and cinematography in equal measure, foreshadowing, hidden meanings, and all people seemed to want to discuss was Don's witty one-liner of the week, the clothes that someone was wearing, or posting a photo of a product they saw on their way to work relating to the episode. Perhaps it was better off-season, but I could never find an outlet with which to discuss my ""reading"" of scenes and episodes because everyone was more interested in upvoting whoever posted an imgur album of their ""Mad Men party"" (translation; ""we wore suits and combed our hair"") that week.  I've seen the same thing in Hannibal (mountains of image macros and fangirling over perceived sexual tension between the two leads), True Detective (""I drew a spiral and some deer antlers on yellowish paper""), and Breaking Bad (they made /r/CirclejerkBreakingBad, but I don't really think it was necessary.)"

There was a lot of vacuous crap on top, but it would only take me five minutes or so to get past it.   BTW totally agree on Mad Men. I'm preparing for a full run through of the show.

TF came about as a response to generic, surface-level reviewing /r/movies. I find it difficult to imagine an analogous sub for series simply because there isn't enough content to discuss. You could look at any 10 years in film history and have more content to discuss than all of the series combined that have film-like aspects and qualities. It's hard to have daily deep dives when there are only so many series that have a deep end.

The affect of improvising dialogue around tightly scripted plot outlines as an alternative style to tightly scripted dialogue and plot outlines in Arrested Development.

Also, maybe I've just grown out of the show, and find the characters as being ""too negative"" all around, as opposed to the show Louie, which sometimes deals with similar themes but with more introspection."
TrueFilm,3a919t,costofanarchy,3,Thu Jun 18 15:07:15 2015 UTC,"First of all, that is a wildly elitist statement -- they are different media with different strengths and weaknesses. Sure, the sheer number of hours which need to be produced for a television series makes a Kubrickian frame by frame perfection all but impossible, but on the same note, it would be nearly impossible for a film to dissect any issue with the depth of the Wire. With the diversity of television distribution venues and the amount of experimentation currently happening around it, I really only expect the the volume of high quality television to increase in the coming years.  Furthermore, there is always content to discuss, regardless of how low brow the media is. I would be extraordinarily interested in reading about the things Michael Bay did right in his latest film. Barring that, we could have a lengthy discussion about the cultural factors leading to its inception and success. We could discuss its message, as every work of art conveys something, even if the author did not intend it -- maybe you found this film to be racist, or overly nationalistic.   Hell, it could even be incredibly informative to break down the reasons that the movie sucks, as these can be tremendously helpful in figuring out what makes good film. I know that for me, the RLM reviews of the Star Wars prequels really changed the way I thought about film. While I always knew that Kubrick was a better director than Spielberg, I would have had trouble really articulating the difference. As silly as they are, the RLM reviews sparked my interest in thinking differently and more analytically about film.  While I'm not positive that television show discussion belongs here, simply because they are different media, that definitely does not mean that there isn't any space for this type of conversation about television."

Although this last issue (haphazard episode consumption) is becoming a rarer way of consuming TV deliberately, I feel that people who live with others still consume some amount of TV this way based on their cohabitants viewing choices (i.e., those of their roommates, significant others, and family members).  All that said, I'm totally in favor of a one-month trial."
TrueFilm,3a919t,costofanarchy,-1,Thu Jun 18 16:02:55 2015 UTC,"Although I do agree with you, there are exceptions to what is stereotypically TV, that warrants discussion on a higher level than has been on reddit. The Wire, for instance, is great film making. It is formatted for television, but the direction and writing of not only individual episodes, but the series as a whole, was an achievement in the art of visual storytelling. They shoot pictures included ""The Wire,"" the whole series as one of the top ""movies,"" in the 21st century. They listed the director as ""multiple directors."" Which I thought was hilarious. They also list the ""movie,"" as being 3600 minutes, which is funny as well.   That website aggregates lists from other sources, there are obviously more than enough people that think a TV show like The Wire can be considered an extraordinary achievement in the art of film making"
TrueFilm,3a919t,Nevtendo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:45:34 2015 UTC,"Also, if more people were willing to consider The Wire a film (and I'm not sure I would myself, but I can see an argument for it), and if pretty much all film critics had seen The Wire (which may already be true, but I'm not sure), then The Wire would probably be (at least should be, if I can make a bold claim), much higher than #315.  In fact, I think it would easily make the Top 25, and quite possibly the Top 10.  Though maybe not, because the show, while visually competently made, is mostly excellent because of narrative, dialogue, acting, and perhaps most of all, subtext.  It's visual style does lend a ""real-ness"" to it though, that's very fitting."
TrueFilm,3a919t,costofanarchy,5,Thu Jun 18 18:22:36 2015 UTC,"I don't consider it a film because of the definitions of what separates a Film and a television series, as what was OP's point, they're different formats. However, my argument, is that within the TV series there are incredible examples of film-making as an art, that elevates the series, and makes it possible for discussion on a sub that should be discussing filmmaking as an art, not a product defined by parameters of formatting."
TrueFilm,3a919t,Nevtendo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:05:00 2015 UTC,It's not a great idea to use They shoot pictures as a source in a subreddit where everyone gives Sight and Sound final authority.
TrueFilm,3a919t,friendlyallamerican,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:27:48 2015 UTC,"Right. I'm not trying to use it as an ultimate source or anything. I'm not even trying to validate it's position in the list or its right of even being there.   It's just that if its an aggregate of people ranking films, then there are enough sources out there that consider it to have reached such a level of film/video/tv art that they felt the need to include it into their lists.   And if we discuss on this sub, the art of actual filmmaking, would it not be valid to bring up lets say, how dialogue is filmed, and someone made a reference to the Wire, would it not be OK because its a TV show?   I don't want to just open the floodgates and have in depth evaluations of mork and mindy. But lets say the Twilight Zone, should the directors and cinematographers and writers craft be banned from a subreddit that should discuss that craft?"
TrueFilm,3a919t,Nevtendo,13,Thu Jun 18 19:24:57 2015 UTC,"I see there's some interest in this idea so I'm gonna say right out that it will never happen. What's good about TV and what's good about film doesn't overlap, especially for the purpose of discussion on Reddit. This is why we have subreddits, so that one community doesn't have to be the same thing to everybody.   We already had a few threads along the lines of 'I think this TV show is as good as film so we should talk about it here' which meant we made a rule that says these discussions were not appropriate here.  It seems the problem with a truefilm-like subreddit is this: a fandom can sustain a subreddit devoted to one show, but unlike film there's not really a canon of stuff everybody watches or even just a few current shows that everyone keeps up with whether they like it or not, similar to blockbuster movies. There's so much fragmentation that finding enough common ground for general discussion is harder. I do think itst doable but someone has to create enough content to kickstart activity."

Twilight Zone, I Love Lucy, The Simpsons, Seinfeld, The Sopranos, Mad Men...even then, TV tends to reflect the times they're made in even more than movies so it's understandable that people don't even watch the 'best' stuff from the generation before.  If you're a connoisseur of the Golden Age of TV there are quite a few more that were considered 'must-watch.' Too much, in my opinion...I'm not gonna feel bad for putting off stuff like Deadwood until I feel like it."

Would you really consider the entirety of any of these shows (The Sopranos and Mad Men aside) as essential viewing?  Or would you recommend select episodes (or just recommend that someone watch ""enough"" to understand what the show is like and what it's merits are)?  I'm certainly not suggesting there's anything wrong with viewing the entitreity of any of these shows, but is watching every episode essential?  Also, The Simpsons is still ongoing, so maybe we should leave that out of the discussion."

That's not so different from film, how many people really watch Citizen Kane? And you don't need to be a completist to see the greatest hits since very few shows are completely worth watching ince their over unless you really care. Even I have 3 random episodes of Buffy I never saw.  The modern infatuation is with adult-themed narrative TV anyway, much different from what's still good about certain episodes of Looney Tunes.

It seems like discussion of those belongs in this subreddit, and while the same characters are featured in many of them, and some shorts are sequels in a sense to others, they're still very much films.   certain contemporary cartoons are greater achievements than True Detective or Sherlock   Which ones are you thinking of?  I would put Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra up there with some of the best of ""adult-themed narrative TV,"" but am struggling to think of much else that comes close (possibly because I haven't seen it), outside of some Japanese animation (of which I'm not too well-versed in)."

TrueFilm,3a919t,costofanarchy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:33:08 2015 UTC,"Adventure Time and Steven Universe.   I've not seen those, thanks.   I don't think the Avatar shows are really all that special except for their notoriety. They're basically Star Wars for people born after 2000. It is mostly enjoyable but still basically made for children and action oriented, I think they fall apart if you try to take them seriously as art.   The action is for the most part far more visually coherent than what we see in popular live action cinema these days, and I would say the shows are visually appealing as a whole.    Maybe they are a post-2000s generation Star Wars, and I guess if one were to take the position that Star Wars is not art then you could say the same for Avatar, but there's a lot of subtext (or maybe it's really just the text) about society and governance in Avatar (more so than in the Star Wars films, but that's to be expected given their relative lengths).  The antagonists and villains in Korra are mostly embodiments of other noble ideas taken to extremes.  Now all this may not be particularly ""deep,"" but I haven't encountered such a thorough exploration of these topics in contemporary fiction (maybe it's just out of vogue in the post-Cold War world).  I feel that to dismiss the shows as lacking in artistic merit is quite reductive.  I also think the character development and writing (in the original show) is particularly strong.  Sure, most of the characters may be following standard arcs, but the execution is top notch.  If you have any particular criticisms about why they fall apart as serious art, I'd be happy to hear them (and if you can link me to any essays that already exist, I'd be happy to look at those).  But if you were to replace Avatar shows with Harry Potter (books and/or movies) in what you wrote, I'd agree nearly 100% (except for perhaps the focus on action and the exact time period of appeal).  So maybe it's just a matter of taste (I have no idea what you're feelings toward Harry Potter are)."
TrueFilm,3a919t,lordhadri,2,Thu Jun 18 19:57:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll stop being evasive. It's not about what is or isn't art exactly, but I just don't think Korra was very good. Sure it seemed like an attempt to do something more sophisticated as an expansion of what The Last Airbender already did. They just blew it every time on fundamental levels, except for Season 3. That was the only time there was an antagonist who was a credible alternative to Korra, whom we needed to see her change and make sacrifices to overcome.   It's an achievement in its own way that a show aimed at children can find wide appeal among older people and I'm okay with that on many TV shows and children's movies. What Korra did that I didn't like was what happens to a lot of TV shows that become enslaved to their own fandoms; giving audiences what they're demanding to see in place of narrative satisfaction. (""Good writing."") That explains the patronizing ending. Meanwhile Steven Universe actually got away with openly gay characters without deriving that choice from fan-supported pairings.   Korra consistently had problems like this. The whole reason The Last Airbender was any good is that it was a surprisingly bold revision of the monomyth. Korra didn't just not have that structure, it ended up looking a lot like modern blockbuster movies with its uncritical portrayals of superheroes and unexamined post-9/11 politics and inside references to the previous show. That stuff's there, so when we say 'this doesn't get passed over for being a kid's show' we have to actually mean it: I don't think it works.   Here's how I felt about it before Season 3. The following two seasons were much better, mainly because they sidelined characters who didn't work (Tenzin and Mako) and finally figured out what to do with Korra herself. Even on a basic animation level though, I think it's good but relied way too much finding excuses to have a bending fight in every episode. These weren't always creatively animated and it had a negative effect on the storytelling too.  And hell yeah I'm a big Star Wars and Harry Potter fan, we can always stay true to the pop phenomenons of our eras. We can just also be realistic about what they did and didn't achieve."

TrueFilm,3a6by5,mythicalsage,40,Wed Jun 17 15:59:22 2015 UTC,"Very well done. I agree with you that the ending is absolutely perfect and Jackson did a brilliant job, and a good decision in removing Sharkey and the scouring of the shire.  One plot point that coincides with Frodo leaving on the ship to the grey havens is that the world is changing, magic is leaving middle earth and the true age of men is about to begin - King Elessar is crowned and the elves, gandalf, and frodo - the only real magical characters left alive, including the last ring-bearer, all leave.  When that ship sails away at the very ending it signifies that magic has left the world and that middle-earth is now under the first great rule of men and the mundane.  My take, at least. And more evident a point in the books."
TrueFilm,3a6by5,wuzizname,3,Wed Jun 17 19:22:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. There is also that story happening alongside and in conjunction with everything I was talking about in the video. That's what makes the ending so wonderful, because there are multiple themes reaching a conclusion at the same time. I chose to focus specifically on the characters because the idea of magic leaving Middle-earth is, as you say, much more prevalent in the books than the films."
TrueFilm,3a6by5,andres9231,13,Thu Jun 18 19:18:37 2015 UTC,"Very cool! I like the points you bring up about the differences between plot and story, and it makes a very good argument for the lengthy ending (which never bothered me, but definitely bothered some people).

TrueFilm,3a6by5,jadedSEVEN,3,Wed Jun 17 20:13:06 2015 UTC,"Great stuff. I also watched the first part of your Hobbit review, which I thought was fantastic as well. However, I don't think Peter Jackson is to blame for the Hobbit movies as much as it was the producers' fault. I sincerely believe that Peter Jackson did not want to make The Hobbit. The movie trilogy had many issues during pre-production, including delays, lawsuits, and the series being expanded from two films as Jackson originally intended to three. If you watch the behind the scenes features, Jackson keeps on making jokes like ""God, this is going to suck,"" and it's the only joke he's making. The other cast members have looks and expressions that read as if they just want to go home--Ian McKellen apparently broke down and cried when he saw how many green screens he had to work with, and considered quitting acting. This Cracked article sums everything up."
TrueFilm,3a6by5,belgiangeneral,7,Fri Jun 19 06:03:25 2015 UTC,"You talk about how the ring ""wasn't destroyed in Frodo's heart"" after the demise of Sauron. Is that actually in the books? Because if it's not in the books, then it's very unlikely that Peter Jackson intended it, and more likely that it's just something you  thought you were seeing. As far as I know, the true reason why Frodo remained sad after the demise of the ring is because he knew his time in Middle-Earth was over. He knew it was his destiny to part to Valinor, as all ring-bearers do, together with the Elves.   I'm also not convinced about your definitions of ""story"" and ""plot"", especially the latter. You say ""plot"" is ""just all the stuff that happens"" (the events) but narrativists have always defined plot as the specific sequence or order of the events. In other words, ""plot"" refers to how the events are structured; how they succeed each other. For example, in a romantic plot, you will first have events with certain problems and tribulations and after that events where ""good"" triumphs. In a tragic plot those tribulations will be followed by scenes where ""good"" loses and the characters lament over the collapse of certain values. And so forth. I've never heard any scholar of narratives refer to the events of a story with the term ""plot"".  A story is a sequence of events with a beginning, middle, and an end, with a subject, a certain coherence, and a plot. A plot tells something about how those events are sequenced. Feel free to disagree, but that's just how I've been taught narrativists use these concepts."
TrueFilm,3a6by5,spagett1134,15,Wed Jun 17 21:39:43 2015 UTC,"To your first point, that is absolutely in the books. It's even directly alluded to in the scene in which Frodo tells Sam his wound from Weathertop never fully healed, that's a result of the dark magic never really leaving his body. That's why every ringbearer had to leave Middle Earth. And since Same technically became a ringbearer when he thought Shelob killed Frodo, he actually leaves Middle Earth eventually in the books too. (Once his family dies, he had abnormally long life because of his exposure to the ring)."
TrueFilm,3a6by5,belgiangeneral,2,Thu Jun 18 01:40:26 2015 UTC,"It's even directly alluded to in the scene in which Frodo tells Sam his wound from Weathertop never fully healed    Yeah, I know, but we were talking about the effect of wearing the ring, so you can't say ""it's even alluded to in the books, his wound from Weathertop never fully healed"". These are two different things. Both magical, sure, but definitely different."
TrueFilm,3a6by5,bulcmlifeurt,3,Thu Jun 18 06:53:35 2015 UTC,"I think that they are different without being unrelated. The wound from weathertop is a physical representation of Frodo's mental scarring. It is representative of the journey he has been on and the terrible effect it had on him, a journey he had to take because of the ring.   Also, as discussed above, while the theme of magic leaving Middle-earth is extremely prevalent in the books, the film presents it as a much more personal decision. It is the solution to Frodo's melancholy and traumatic stress.   As to the definitions of ""story"" and ""plot,"" I definitely agree that the sequence of events, how they follow from each other, is included under the term of ""plot,"" and perhaps I should have been more clear in that description. A plot is a beginning, a middle and an end: the stuff that happens. But I was more concerned with defining ""story"" in this video, as that is the one which is far more important from a writer's perspective. I wanted to make the distinction useful for writers when they are constructing a narrative and to make it clear what truly impacts the shape of a story (themes, decisions, ect.)"
TrueFilm,3a6by5,belgiangeneral,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:31:08 2015 UTC,"This seems like a semantic issue to me. What you've mentioned are definitely the narratologist-approved, academic definitions of plot and story (or rather, fabula and syuzhet), but the general public doesn't really employ those definitions.  Kind of like how the word 'racism', from a sociological / academic perspective, is generally held to mean 'power plus prejudice', but in common parlance it just means 'prejudice based on race' (hence a lot of people take issue with the statement that 'white people can't be racist').  In informal parlance I think the definitions used here for plot and story should get a pass. To appeal to authority: Scorsese and Hitchcock used similar definitions, Film Crit Hulk did a piece with basically the same theme here, etc. It's not unprecedented. In any case the OP defines his terms at the beginning of the video so I don't think it's a big deal."
TrueFilm,3a6by5,mappsy91,2,Fri Jun 19 02:33:48 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that there's a difference between its informal and its academic use, and that's not a bad thing at all. So if you're mentioning these two concepts informally, it's okay to use that informal use.  However, when your video has the subtitle ""What's the difference between plot and story?"", then I think it's warranted that we go at least a little bit more towards their academic definitions, so I do think my comment was appropriate here."

It's likely that Trevorrow had some other part for Zara that got cut, either showing her as someone who was pretty good (thus making her death more impactful) or showing her as incompetent, thus justifying it.

Her death could have been important, but the rest of the film does nothing to make it so. I can't help to think that the producers influenced the final cut in order to keep the film within the desired boundaries, to make it accessible to the broadest audience possible.

Having a heavy emphasis on kid characters bears no relation on the degree of family-friendliness of a movie, in my opinion.  All that said, I fucking love Jurassic Park and I think I first saw it when I was 8 or 9 years old (but it also gave me horrific nightmares). Cheers."

TrueFilm,3a2zj1,neoballoon,17,Wed Jun 17 10:10:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a difference between women being mistreated on a show and women being mistreated by a show. While yes, the men on Mad Men don't really treat women well, the actual characters are portrayed pretty well."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Wetzilla,3,Wed Jun 17 14:20:44 2015 UTC,"It's common language in tv/film criticism to say (x group) is treated (y) by (z show). Of course the female characters in the show aren't treated well by the men in the show, but that's clearly not the attitude of the writers, or the point they're trying to make about the systemic oppression of women in the workplace."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,neoballoon,2,Wed Jun 17 16:27:51 2015 UTC,"The pilot for Mad Men was pretty sexist. And I can see how the show started that way (Ive never rewatched an episode), but the final product was pretty feminist after 7 years of self-reflection and self-correction."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,BZenMojo,14,Thu Jun 18 16:54:26 2015 UTC,"Regarding Dr. Wu, I assume he survived for the sequel.   And yes, I did like that the movie started off as a critique of giant sequels, but then it becomes that giant sequel.   Not to go too off topic, but Mad Men portrays women as real people and critiques the sexism."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Gonzzzo,10,Tue Jun 16 22:14:16 2015 UTC,"Yea, I read something awhile ago about how Mad Men is one of the few/only shows to consistently pass that test on the portrayal of women (The Bechdel Test) 1. Is there more than one woman? 2. If so, do the women talk to each other? 3. If so, do they talk to about something other than a man?""  Mad Men has the strongest & most compelling women I've ever seen on a TV show. The fact that they're living in an age of rampant sexism makes them that much more endearing"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,hydra815,25,Wed Jun 17 08:02:01 2015 UTC,"The Bechdel Test is not an accurate or persuasive test for how women are portrayed in a film. It is an interesting concept to bring attention to a female character but even Bechdel herself has asked for it not be used as a yardstick for cinematic gender equality. Too many people have taken it on board as an indicator of strong female characters but it really isn't. That being said, from what I've seen of Mad Men, it does write women well but I'd argue that it is easy to write a compelling character of any gender in television than it is in film so comparisons to this and Jurassic World are effectively worthless."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Gonzzzo,3,Wed Jun 17 08:57:51 2015 UTC,"that's fair, I just first learned about the Bechdel Test from an article about Mad Men that was kinda challenging the perceived ""sexism"" on the show after a controversial episode by illustrating how it had the most down-to-earth & substantive portrayal of women on TV (I watched the 1st half of the series as it was airing, then started rewatching it on Netflix about a month ago so it's kinda still on my mind)  No love triangles, no ""will they?/wont they?"" stuff, just fleshed-out men co-existing with fleshed-out women. I'd make the argument that the show has two main characters/stars, one obviously being Jon Hamm & the other subtly being Elizabeth Moss...but that realization didn't hit me until I'd been rewatching the show for some time  Learning about the Bechdel Test really opened my eyes to how few TV series/movies actually meet it's criteria when it seems so trivial (I don't think Jurassic World even passed the 1st part of the test, for example) , But I wasn't making any comparisons between Mad Men & Jurassic World. I've never been under the impression that passing the Bechdel test = automatic strong/good women."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,hydra815,11,Wed Jun 17 09:26:28 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Jurassic World passes the Bechdel test with flying colours. There are two sisters in the film and they both have a conversation with each other about their family and their working lives. But it's painfully obvious that Jurassic World has no strong characters, let alone strong female characters. This is why the Bechdel test doesn't work. It didn't really lessen my enjoyment of the movie though, it is pure narrative fanservice and worked wonders on me."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Gonzzzo,8,Wed Jun 17 09:50:07 2015 UTC,"lol I guess you're technically right. But iirc the non-Bryce Dallas Howard sister isn't in the film at all after that phone call early in the film (which, admittedly, I forgot about)  Again, I'm not actually weighing Jurassic World against the Bechdel Test in terms of the films quality, I totally agree with you that the test isn't a good measurement of quality/substance, I was just using it to make an example of how surprising it is that so many films/TV don't hold up well against the test.   I was expecting to enjoy Jurassic World & it still far surpassed my expectations."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,hydra815,7,Wed Jun 17 10:06:44 2015 UTC,The technicalities are what make the Bechdel test redundant though and kind of disrespectful to directors out there who are trying to make strong female characters that have relationships with men. Run Lola Run is considered to have one of the strongest female characters of recent times but fails the Bechdel test miserably because she never has a conversation with another woman in the film.
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,BZenMojo,4,Wed Jun 17 10:25:49 2015 UTC,"The movie is about Lola saving her boyfriend. Yeah, she's a complicated character, but you can already see the limits of the narrative and how it specifically runs afoul on 2/3rds of the Bechdel Test. Just because it's better doesnt make it great."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,BZenMojo,4,Thu Jun 18 16:58:15 2015 UTC,"The bechdel test is a low bar, not a high bar. If you're not passing it, you probably have issues. If you are passing it, there's a chance you're still having issues."

TrueFilm,3a2zj1,SinisterExaggerator_,4,Wed Jun 17 04:06:35 2015 UTC,The author points out that this is the first onscreen death of a female in the Jurassic Park series. Is it possible that her death was exaggerated in an attempt to make this fact stand out more?
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,henrythebrown,53,Sun Jun 21 07:33:49 2015 UTC,"I agree that it was in bad taste. There has to be a reason and purpose to actually show these things and it needs to fit a context, and it just stood out as unnecessarily violent. I don't mean bloody or anything like that, just cruel. People on this thread talk about these dinosaurs as if they don't have morality, that they kill good or bad, but the raptors work with Chris Pratt and the T-Rex is shown to be the hero by the end.   Every other person's death seems to fit accordingly by what they do as well. I'm not saying its a rule, but it's something the film establishes. A good character might die, but it might be for a reason that makes a point, changes the other characters or pushes the plot forward ( I don't mean in this film, I just mean generally in films).  This death was unnecessary. She didn't earn that death and none of the characters acknowledged it. Only we as the audience saw it, so why did the film show us something so over the top for her character. It glorified her death to make it entertaining. Why? It doesn't show the other characters react to it. If they looked shocked I'd understand what to think about it, but it doesn't.   People will probably say I'm reading too much into it, but I don't care. If you put something in a film, you do it for a god damn reason. Everything should be designed to get an effect, push an emotion, reveal something about the character or push the story forward. So why make her death so horrible?"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,otherpeoplesmusic,40,Wed Jun 17 02:29:11 2015 UTC,". If you put something in a film, you do it for a god damn reason.   Man.. it's always refreshing to hear other people say this. I can't count how many discussions I've had with people about films and they always ... always... try to make out that the crew spent all this time and energy on something that served no purpose other than to 'entertain'.   With that said, I'm now wondering if this is an example of wasting time on something for sheer entertainment value, validating their point and stripping meaning from film."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,tfraking,4,Wed Jun 17 09:08:13 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you. I remember taking a writing course and one of the things that stuck with me was how the professor said that in good storytelling, everything serves a purpose regarding the rest of the story. They also said that if hypothetically removing something from the story wouldn't affect the story negatively, then you probably need to remove that thing. It's fluff. This is why YMS complains about Birdemic showing excessive amounts of the main character driving around, walking, etc. Not because it's fun to hate movies, but because bad storytelling usually has an explainable cause.  I'm so surprised when people tell me that a movie's purpose isn't to tell a good story. For me, it's central."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,otherpeoplesmusic,3,Fri Jun 19 21:32:25 2015 UTC,"that a movie's purpose isn't to tell a good story. For me, it's central.   I agree with this. It doesn't matter how the story is told, as long as it's telling one - and that it's done well. Shit, I'll often forgive a films shortcomings if the story was told well enough, and definitely if I believed it then. If I'm thinking about it afterward and I break it down and find myself not believing it, I still won't dismiss that initial viewing because at the time, they made it believable and engaging etc"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,sfinney2,17,Sat Jun 20 05:02:22 2015 UTC,"Everything should be designed to get an effect, push an emotion   It sounds like they did just that. Maybe that was the intention? It felt like anti-fanservice which I thought was refreshing (yet horrifying!) to see."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,henrythebrown,9,Wed Jun 17 03:56:13 2015 UTC,"They did technically push an emotion, but I think it was the wrong one. Doing something different for the sake of it isn't good film making, it's ignorant film making, and this ignorant film couldn't build tension and make characters worth caring about, so it essentially punches the audience in the face to get an effect. I personally think It's cheap and unjustified."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Dawnoftime,11,Thu Jun 18 23:36:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Yes, every film establishes the rules for its own universe. It abided by the rule ""you die accordingly to your sin"" for pretty much everybody except Zara.   And don't worry, you're not reading too much into it haha"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,havensk,10,Wed Jun 17 02:45:07 2015 UTC,"I thought JW must have had way too many cooks in the kitchen in terms of writing. Did anyone else not care at all about the kids? The divorce storyline felt very forced. It's like the actors mom was in the room and suggested it to show off his range of emotion.  But more to your point, the only reason I can think of to make that scene so violent is one many writers must have wanted to show off the pterodactyl's water hunting behavior. Those dives were pretty, and to me they were memorable.   I agree though, getting swallowed whole was brutal. I think the audience was to assume that she died immediately, but I loved your take on it."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,twinarteriesflow,18,Wed Jun 17 07:25:28 2015 UTC,"My wife and I were talking about this scene in particular right after the movie was over. We talked about how not only was it unnecessarily cruel of a death compared to literally every other character, but kind of terrifying that she got swallowed whole, she wasn't chewed up because the mosasaurs mouth was gigantic. Then the other sad bit is the fact that she probably knew as soon as she hit the water what was waiting for her just below the surface. It was such a brutal death that it really broke the tone of the film and completely took me out of it. It didn't seem real considering no other character suffered a fate anywhere near to her, and her worst crime was being concerned about her upcoming wedding.   In fact I felt as though the script was an amalgam from at least two different stories, merged together where some bits of one story really stuck out and made it all the way to the final draft."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Snaket,8,Wed Jun 17 03:02:24 2015 UTC,"If it makes you feel slightly better, Mosasarus has a second row of teeth in the back of the throat, so she probably got quickly chewed up when his jaws closed. Not to mention the force of the jaw snap would probably have killed Zara immediately."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,tapomirbowles,2,Wed Jun 17 06:07:22 2015 UTC,"But the jaw probably would not snap all the way as the Pterodactyl will be lodged between, which meant she likely got swallowed."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,BZenMojo,20,Sat Jun 20 18:04:40 2015 UTC,"In my movie experience, there was a group of young teenaged boys who loved commentating over Jurassic World. In this particular death scene, they were ecstatic and cheering. One of them said, ""This is the best movie ever!"". That was the exact opposite of my reaction, and it bothered me greatly.  That is the demographic that this death caters to.  They also had to say ""CHRIS PRATT!"" every time he came on scene and at the climx fight scene they decided to start clapping."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,sfinney2,148,Wed Jun 17 02:10:57 2015 UTC,"""During the movie, the entire series, and plenty of action movies, most people get a death directly proportional to their sins.""     But why does it have to be like that? - I´m sorry, but that is just stupid. That´s a rule which nobody should be forced to follow in filmmaking. Thats just some shitty morality play made up so people can feel better about it, and maybe its an american thing where there has to be hope and punishment for the bad guys, and happiness for the good guys.  But It´s not like that in real life. Bad things happen to good people. I actually found her death refreshing in the sense that it really showed that it doesnt matter if you are good or bad. The dinosaurs don´t care, you´re just food to them.     ""When a civilian died in The Lost World, a car blocked his death from us.""  ""But here's the thing: nobody else, including villains, get a death as terrible as hers. Any normal civilians are only attacked. The main antagonist gets the privilege to get killed off screen by a raptor.""    Well her death is covered up by the flying dinosaur, you actually dont see her go into the mouth, because it is covered up. What is happening is, you are imagining what is happening to her, because being devoured alive like that inside a big sea creature cant be pleasent. But the way in which it happened on screen is not that much more different. The guy getting eaten alive by the raptor is having an equally bad day, believe me :) And in regards to the juxtaposition with the next part of the movie with the romance.. lets just not forget that the characters, Owen and Claire, have no idea Zara is dead. For all they know, she could be on the ferry, or running around the park, so thats why there is no grief from them, or tonal shift. Because its information they dont have, only the audience does."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Could-Have-Been-King,76,Tue Jun 16 21:38:51 2015 UTC,"Ill cut to the point the OP already made but is somehow being missed:  The director made a compositional choice to make her death one that was highlighted and focused. The villain gets ""don't worry, he's dead, let's move on"" while a side character gets ""LOOK HOW DEAD SHE IS. LOOK AT IT."" It's clear intentionality more than a narrative acknowledgment. The director wants you to feel something about this death differently than you feel about other deaths. The question is...what? Is it a reward? A tragedy?  But if it's a tragedy, why does no one care?  Then the answer is...she's meant to die because her death is self-justifying. It serves no other purpose than to entertain."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,250lespaul,25,Wed Jun 17 02:47:55 2015 UTC,"If anything her death was meant to just be scary. It reminds me of the random victims in Jaws, and the death itself was very similar, complete with obvious allusions to it earlier in the film."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,henrythebrown,24,Wed Jun 17 03:58:35 2015 UTC,"I would argue that the time the two events happened is more significant.  The Big Bad gets sliced open by a raptor... in the middle of the climax! At that point in the film, we don't care about him, especially because he's not incredibly Big or Bad to begin with, he's just an asshole. The director made the choice to not focus on his death, and that was the right choice, because at that moment, we really care about the protagonists. They're being chased by raptors, so we stick with them. In the time we could take to linger on the antagonist's death, our protagonist group could have been attacked by another raptor. It makes sense.  I would also argue that her death was not just for entertainment. I actually really appreciated the Mosasaur death, because it threw me off guard. As soon as we saw it in the first act, you knew that it was going to pop up later. You probably figured that it was going to play a big role in the final dino fight. But by highlighting a huge death involving the mosasaur before the climax, it really jerks with your perceptions. It kept me on my toes during the actual climax, and it wasn't until moments before the mosasaur ate the hybrid dino that I figured out that's what they were building to. In my opinion, it was a great way to foreshadow what was going to happen while also keeping the audience on their toes."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,250lespaul,14,Wed Jun 17 03:50:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with this analysis. Especially about the ""cutting back to the protagonists and the raptor chase"" bit with the antagonists death. Hitchcock(I believe it was him) had a thing he called ""meanwhile, back at the ranch."" It was a directing/editing technique where, JUST as some new resolution of a plot point builds (maybe even after that small bit climaxes), you cut  back to the other party to see how THEIR events will play out. I believe the raptor death was showing the BBEG letting his hubris be his own down fall. ""oh come on. It's me! Your king! You'll listen to me for sure!"" as the sweat beads up hoping his bluff isn't called. So he gets a ""theatrical"" death. With his resolution being a way to cut back to the BBED (Big Bad Evil Dinosaur in this case).   I believe her death was a lot of things. A call back to the mososaurus's size and potential. A reminder of the indiscriminate violence they have tried to contain. How innocents will pay the price once extreme over confidence and pride finally cracks. And in the end, isn't that what Jurassic Park is showing? How close can we fly to the sun? The raptor bites the hand off our military friend after he tries to flaunt his control. They tried to control nature's most vicious power and payed the price."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,henrythebrown,8,Wed Jun 17 05:20:49 2015 UTC,"They tried to control nature's most vicious power and payed the price.   Surely if that was the message they would show one of the people responsible for their captivity being savaged. Someone who maybe directly treated them badly. But they didn't, they did it to her assistant, who's biggest crime was loosing the children because their aunty didn't have time for them.   God, the logic in this film is a mess"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,564738291056,5,Wed Jun 17 18:05:38 2015 UTC,"True. But there wasn't really anyone that treated them poorly. There wasn't a real antithesis to Chris Pratt's character (with a forgettable name that's mentioned hardly ever which drove me nuts). It seemed as though it had a message to say, but it couldn't articulate it. Big army guy wants to weaponize the dinos. Guy who actually weaponized the dinos literally disappears off screen with the only explanation being ""he worked for me."" Owner who wanted them to be ""cooler"" pays for a sort of greed. But I his redemption, he literally goes up in flames. It wasn't martyrdom, it was just bad luck (and a bit of over confidence thinking he could actually fly the chopper). But it wasn't a terrible film. It just wasn't Spielberg. It was more like Spielberg lite. It's a series with his name stapled to it with people without the experience trying to be like him. And it was a fun thing to watch, but it felt like it tried to be more but failed."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Could-Have-Been-King,3,Wed Jun 17 18:34:06 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't even call it Spielberg lite, because there was nothing Spielberg about it. My problem with the film isn't the fact that it tries to be Spielberg and fails, or the fact it couldn't articulate a message. My problem with the film is that it misunderstands what it is to make an entertaining film. It thinks cranking up the stakes 100% and making the monsters 100 times bigger makes the drama bigger as well, but there's no drama here. And that's because there's no tension, not just because the plot is so convoluted and fractured but because it fails to create real characters I can believe in and care for. I watched the first film a few weeks before, and that film had me on the flipping edge of my seat, because the film took it's time to craft people, not cardboard cut outs.  So yeah, to summarize, I personally do think it's a terrible film."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,564738291056,5,Thu Jun 18 23:54:55 2015 UTC,"I'd buy this if Zara's scenes weren't totally critical. She demonstrates almost, if not, no redeeming qualities. She's shown be distracted by a bachelor party invitation, absorbed in her phone, trying to dampen Gray's enthusiastic running, etc, etc. You could have gotten all the same effects with a random character. It's hard not to read a scene at the end of all those scenes as a cause with this 'poetic justice' as an effect.   To me, and to OP I think, it's also way more brutal than any other death in the entire movie. It'd be one thing if there were other multi-part death sequences for people, but there really weren't. And most of the other deaths were security people with guns and training. (There were the people in the Rex enclosure, but their deaths were pretty swift.)"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,BLUYear,2,Thu Jun 18 17:49:38 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned, the brutality of the death is meant (at least in part) to subvert the audience's expectations for the mosasaur. It's a big dinosaur that gets more screentime than any other (besides the raptors) in the first act, and because of the focus, you know it's going to come back in a ""big"" way.  The character itself doesn't matter. Who is eaten doesn't matter. It could have been any character that we had been introduced to. Zara could have been written to be much more sympathetic - or much more of an asshole - and it wouldn't matter. What matters, in the context of the story, is that there is a big, prolonged sequence that features multiple dinosaurs interacting with the human characters and themselves. The emphasis on the sequence subverts the audience's expectations for the mosasaur in the final act. We think it's done with, that the tease in the first act was already used. It wasn't. And when the mosasaur eats the hybrid dino, it's a lot more surprising than if Zara's death had never happened."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Gonzzzo,8,Thu Jun 18 19:25:39 2015 UTC,"I'm aware it's managing our expectations for later in the movie, and not arbitrary, but I still think how drawn out the sequence is isn't in keeping with other death sequences in the movie, which follow a suspense and then kill formula.    Zara could have been written to be much more sympathetic - or much more of an asshole - and it wouldn't matter.   But it does.   Zara being basically a satirical caricature - she is uniformly unlikable and has basically no personality beyond looking at her iPhone and saying something about a party - puts things that are happening to her into a moral frame. Within that moral frame, her death becomes horrifyingly incommensurate to her actions.   I would have much rather it been a random bystander, or not a multi-part violent sequence. You could have followed the suspense then death formula by threatening a character's immersion in the water."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,lordhadri,2,Thu Jun 18 20:13:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the result is one of a strange level of astonishment and confusion and all you're left to do is just sit there and mumble ""what the fuck""."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,LeifEriksonisawesome,21,Thu Jun 18 09:40:35 2015 UTC,"I kinda get what OP is saying. It wasn't even the fact that she was eaten like that, it was the 5-10 seconds prior when she's dropped in the water & the pterodactyls thrashing about trying to get dibs on her, picking her up & dropping her underwater over & over  We watch (or more importantly, we hear) a half-drowning/half-screaming woman (who wasn't a ""bad guy"" at all) being treated like a piece of bread in the middle of a flock of starving ducks. That got under my skin as well & stuck with me long after the movie finished"

TrueFilm,3a2zj1,tapomirbowles,13,Wed Jun 17 07:34:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it might be an American thing. But I'm not saying that each death has to match their sins. No. The movie does in fact keep each death proportional to how they act as people. Pretty consistently actually. That made me get  the tone of a ""morality play,"" so once she gets slaughtered, it just doesn't fit. Obv, how I felt was subjective and doesn't apply to everyone."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,564738291056,9,Tue Jun 16 22:17:16 2015 UTC,"Colin Trevorrow meant for it to be subversive of that quality of the series, but he did it for the sake of being subversive.  I'm sure there were ways for her death to have been consistent with the tone of the film. Perhaps the main characters could have negatively reacted to it while a spectator gawked and filmed it?  There are a lot of problems with Jurassic World. This isn't the biggest of them though."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,newuser92,4,Tue Jun 16 23:19:42 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be like that, and it wasn't with a lot of the deaths in Jurassic World, but why was this particular death made into, I think, the longest death sequence, and also closely followed - almost followed with horror-movie-relish - by the camera? If you think a little blocking is a trade off for how horrible it was to see her get thrown around, screaming, almost dying once, comprehending that, and maybe going comprehending into a slow death? Why was, most likely, a huge some of money spent on those special effects?  Was this more worthy than Military Badguy's death at the jaws of a raptor and his own hubris? (The spitting dinosaur, in J1, was the longest and most gruesome death.)"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Snaket,4,Thu Jun 18 17:39:52 2015 UTC,"Well quite simply, it was to do two things as I see it:  1: Establish the sea monster is still in play, and to set up the ending. (its basically the same thing that happens)  2: Make the audience know that no-one is safe."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Cerebrist,2,Thu Jun 18 18:51:51 2015 UTC,"I don't buy it. Everybody is safe. Zara is a totally unlikable minor character. If she was likable, it would have increased the threat of the dinosaurs.   I also figured out in a later post I made, after this one got me thinking, it's also that this death is the final scene in a series of scenes critical of Zara. Feels like just desserts. It's also a sequence that is formally much more drawn out in its violence than every other death, which usually follows an extended suspense -- > kill formula for the thirty seconds or whatever. For that reason, I would still be a bit disturbed even if it was a random person, but it would be ok.   I recognize that it is working to do some things for the movie, but it's not the best."

They eat flesh and are basically giant chickens with knives and bad attitude. Some fly and then there is a gargantuan swimmer. One of them tricks people like a college hunk tricks legal age high schoolers.  But they follow morality. In fact they are just karmic representations.   It was definitely not that the filmmakers wanted to make a movie were raptors went vs a genius Rex, or T Rex vs T Rex.2.  It's just another movie about Jesus in the purgatory."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,BZenMojo,5,Wed Jun 17 12:37:28 2015 UTC,"Pronographic death? Lol.   Honestly, i agree. Her death initially was cool and all, but I kept thinking to myself. She never got bitten. When the Mosasaur came up, she went right into the throat. The Pterodactyl got bitten. Which meant, as it was sandwiched between his mouth, it would not entirely close, which means she would be deep in the throat. While it begins to chew, I imagine the saliva and all of that will be coming, and she would be swallowed in while the Mosasaur is eating. Which means, she would be alive in there for a while before suffocating or something. That had me extreme sick for the entire movie.   And even so, how could they assume we would like Claire next? She remained such a major bitch. She showed no guilt to what happened in the park, and in fact, SHE HAD NO CARE ABOUT ZARA. Zara informed her she found the boys, moments before the attack. Then, Claire sees the boys and not Zara and does not even question or show remorse? Therefore, Claire remained as selfish as she was. She only cared about herself, and the only emotion we got from her was when her family was in danger. She still had no care for the guests at the Park, NOR her assistant. Zara's death was way harsh, while the ""bad guy"", we did not even get to see the Raptor eat him alive."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Snaket,15,Sat Jun 20 17:40:58 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people are disagreeing with your assessment, but I think you're on to something. I think this movie, like so many others, has an ideology it wants to transmit. In the case of Jurassic World, one of the film's ideologies seems to be ""men should be men and women should be women.""  The power of masculinity is emphasized a number of times: the children choosing Owen to protect them, saying he's a badass, Owen's proclamation that he's the ""alpha"", the woman telling the guy in the control booth to ""be a man for once in your life"" etc.   On the other hand it's made clear that Claire is a ""career woman,"" childless, non-maternal, frigid etc. In other words, not a real woman. Because of this, she'll need to be punished, just as Owen needs to be rewarded for his alignment with the film's hegemonic masculinity. The best punishment a movie can dole out is a painful death, but at the same time, we can't kill one of the main characters (this isn't Game of Thrones) and besides, Owen's reward is that he ""gets the girl"" so she can't be dead.   In this regard, Zara acts as a stand in for Claire. She's career focused, on the phone all the time, doesn't really care about kids etc. With Zara's death, we get to punish Claire as mercilessly as possible, but without actually killing Claire herself.   Additionally, by the end, Claire is more aligned with ""what a woman should be."" She's more emotional, cares more about children, asks the man ""what do we do now"" and so forth."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,yangYing,8,Wed Jun 17 16:58:40 2015 UTC,"Your point about her standing in for Claire is pretty illuminating. They're both labeled ""boring career woman who hates kids,"" but Claire has to live for Owen. Therefore, Zara in a sense dies for her.   I love how the film tried to pay lip service to them being an equal relationship at the end, ""we need each other to survive"" or something like that. But clearly Owen was in control the entire time. A good example of an interdependent relationship would be Mad Max. Neither is controlling. They just work together to get shit done"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,gosuckalime,3,Wed Jun 17 18:29:24 2015 UTC,"I think you guys are totally right about that.  I thought the misogyny at first could be coincidental and subconscious but I'm starting to think this is one of the worst cases I've seen for a film, it's hard to say it wasn't on purpose. At first I thought the movie was just tone deaf and mediocre, but this might be one of the most misogynous mean-spirited movies. I mean you have crap like 'Transformers' but I think in those cases it's just a case that ""sex sells"" targeting to a younger demo of teenagers that like pretty girls. But this is something else, what it is says about women is completely retarded and wrong. Even though it tries spin it by saying: ""Look she's a woman on high heels and helped defeat the dinosaur"", I'm not buying it. Joss Whedon was right from the start, and although Colin Treevrow tried to say the clip wasn't sexist and in the context of the movie wasn't so bad, I still think it was pretty bad.  The movie really left a bad taste in my mouth, specially because it was the first movie I've in the cinema since Mad Max, a much more progressive film in every sense."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,ZackZak30,3,Wed Jun 17 21:01:46 2015 UTC,"Consider that Mikaela is more heroic than Sam in Transformers and actually rescues Bumblebee and joins the fight. In Tran2formers, she convinces Megatron to switch sides. In Transform3rs Rose Huntington Whiteley (also of Mad Max Fury Road) has CIA connections and negotiates with Megatron. The love interests in the first three Transformers films have more narrative control and active power than the female deuteroganist in Jurassic World."

The plot needed mosasaraus to appear towards the beginning of the park, and somewhere between then and its devouring of the I. Rex. It had to happen within an action scene ... since the entire movie is basically action at this point and you couldn't interrupt the flow.  The main characters aren't the humans, they're the dinosaurs. Having the mosasaraus devour the character absentmindedly perfectly demonstrated the power, size and indifference such animals would have. Trying to moralise is a human occupation. Snapping at passing blurs is a dinosaur's.  There needed to be some segway between the mosasaraus thingy and the pterodactyls ... and following a lone pterodactyl would have been odd. Having this lone pterodactyl flying with a limp lifeless corspe character / human would have too morbid, and so they needed to be screaming. And it couldn't be an extra, else there would have been too many unanswered questions ... which is a different type of morbid.  I can't actually think of any other way of keeping the mosasaraus 'believable' ... having it responsible for disposing of another protagonist (the other being the I. Rex) would have been too convenient and misjudged.  Don't they say you should never work with animals or technology? Perhaps we're giving the script too much credit?"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,paxperscientiam,17,Tue Jun 16 21:56:44 2015 UTC,This is 100% the reason for the drawn out death. We needed to be reminded that the Mosasaraus is around and still in play. This makes its appearance at the very end less ridiculous and less random.
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Snaket,5,Wed Jun 17 01:49:25 2015 UTC,"Now what exactly was Zara's crime? I guess she was on the phone a lot and didn't have her eye on the two kids at all times.   Also, keep in mind that she was Bryce Dallas Howards assistant, aka one of the busiest employees working at Jurassic World. Zara was probably on her phone the whole time scheduling meetings, promos, trips for BDH, which I think makes it more tragic."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,TriumphantGeorge,6,Wed Jun 17 06:10:20 2015 UTC,"I applaud the creators for their bravery, though I do think it an unfortunate mistake to have not mentioned Zara at the end. Her death added an important element of authenticity to the film.  The biggest problem in story telling -- as well as the stories we tell about our own lives -- is that we've convinced ourselves that ""everything happens for a reason."" This is an illusion that holds humanity back and renders us largely apathetic to systemic misery. There is no shortage of people who've bought into the karma narrative that would tell you things like ""no one is without sin"" or ""god has a plan for them"" or other such bullshit. The cold truth is that there is no supernatural agent directing the play of life.  Zara's death was a poignant statement about the real world -- people die, sometimes horribly, whether they ""deserve"" it or not. The corollary is just as true. BD Wong's character turned out to be corrupt, yet he, apparently, was able to escape with his life."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,paxperscientiam,7,Fri Jun 19 05:44:05 2015 UTC,"The one issue I had was Claire.   Bryce did an incredible job acting the role, but the producers did nothing to make me like Claire. If anything, she remained the stupid little brat she was from the start. She showed NO EMOTION to what happened in the Park. She did not warn the visitors, and look what happened too. She did not listen to Owen. The only time she showed concern was from a selfish standpoint. My nephews. My Owen. My life.   Zara called her, informing her she found the boys. After the attack, she saw the boys, without Zara. She did not ask for Zara nor did they tell her what happened. They didn't even look traumatized! The I-Rex nearly killed them, and their babysitter suffered WHICH THEY SAW! Yet, ""Oh is that your boyfriend? We are sticking with him. He is a bad ass."" UM... DID YOU NOT JUST WITNESS THE DEATH?   Claire showed no remorse for her actions which essentially is the reason why stuff happened. She cares only about herself and her own life. John Hammond, always, ALWAYS expressed his guilt, despite sending people on the island again. He had good intentions."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Mareeck,4,Sat Jun 20 17:46:33 2015 UTC,"Wow /u/Snaket, you are totally right. Claire indeed was very selfish, though I think that's typical of corporate types (well, the archetype at least). Masarani, like Hammond, was so fantastically rich that he could act like a big kid with his money. However, he was loath to take blame and tried his hardest to assign it to others...until his attempt at redemption. IIRC, I think it took a while for the gravity of the situation to sink into Hammond's head also.  Yeah, the behavior of the boys once reuniting with Claire and Owen did not seem too realistic. Unfortunately, whoever was in charge of that scene, was more interested in sticking in a throwaway joke.  Yeah, John Hammond had actual heart, though it remains a mystery as to how he became rich (well, it's been a while since I've read the novels so maybe it was addressed there). JW does, however, suggest that Masarani built his empire on morally dubious investments.  RIP Sir Richard Attenborough"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Burnouts3s3,3,Sat Jun 20 18:36:48 2015 UTC,"RIP Sir Richard Attenborough!  Yeah, Masrani did try to redeem himself by stopping the I-Rex, but it was a bit too late honestly. He should have acted sooner rather than later. Then again, he only acted when he uncovered the truth behind his dinosaur and how dangerous it was. So he gets credit there. Claire on the other hand, cared more for her own life and her own circle, except Zara.   They gave us too many throw away jokes at some bad segments in my opinion. Even when Masarani was flying the helicopter to stop the I-Rex. ""Look alive boys! Look alive!"" Geez, excluding that scene, and giving us professional gunmen, would have told the same story and made it more interesting when the birds attacked them.   Ah yeah, but of course we can let it slide how these guys became rich. We can just assume they had successful business ventures."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,ShaunaOMeara,3,Sun Jun 21 23:55:32 2015 UTC,"We've convinced ourselves that ""everything happens for a reason"", karma narrative, sins and plans.   It's worse that it first appears. Life is not ordered by reason, but neither is it random. Rather, it is patterned without foundation. There are relationships but they are mechanical and without inherent purpose or meaning.  Perhaps Jurassic World is the great philosophical work of the 2010s.   I do think it an unfortunate mistake to have not mentioned Zara at the end. Her death added an important element of authenticity to the film.   Perhaps nobody mentioning her could be part of that authenticity! Mentioning her would be part of a narrative ""tying up"" from the perspective of the movie. Reality is messier: people are left behind, and forgotten.  Maybe there's a deleted scene there everyone's chilling out at a bar later, amusing themselves with dino-tales, and someone suddenly says: ""oh shit, where's Zara?"""

TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Snaket,3,Fri Jun 19 15:31:08 2015 UTC,"Oh and BD Wong only survived for the sequel Truth  Sorry that's just not supported by the rest of the film. Everyone, and I mean everyone, gets their ""karmic rewards.""   I disagree. While largely true of the film's main characters, there were still quite a number of deaths that were not in proportion to the presumed sins of the character. Park employers and visitors were killed, yet committed no obvious sins. Surely, the schlubby guy eaten by the I-Rex early on didn't deserve death, though I suppose the audience is meant to be ""okay"" with it since he was indeed schlubby. Denafrio's character aside, what of the defense contractors? I'm sure many of them were motivated by the desire to bolster their nation's military -- whether or not this is a ""sin"" is a matter of perspective. Lastly, there are the numerous dinosaurs presumably killed for sport by the I-Rex.   And besides, it's not even her dying, but HOW she died.   I think this gets at the heart of why I despise the karma narrative. When disaster strikes somewhere in the world, you'll have no trouble finding armchair moralists ascribing sin by unnamed actors to explain what is largely explainable by science. If you comb the news, you will find no shortage of victims of horrific violence or accidents. Cases were only those drunk on karma kool-aid would blame the victim. This is why you get some people trying to rationalize her death by pointing out that she did not watch the children closely enough.  The most prominent theme in this movie is the clash between human fragility and human ambition. Just as it is in the nature of humans to exceed their reach and to succumb to hubris and corruption, it is in the nature of the mosasaurus to eat what it can -- despite the prey's beauty and intelligence. There was a relevant line about what is deemed a monster being a matter of perspective and how humans are used to being the ""cat."" The mosasaurus did not see beauty or a being that needed punishing, it saw food -- nothing more or less.  At this point I'm probably babbling, so feel free to call me out on it!"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,th1smustbetheplace,4,Fri Jun 19 20:59:03 2015 UTC,"The thing is that this is in fact a PG-13 film. There shouldn't be much thinking about live and death in the real world. Sure it's a point where killing off characters is okay in a way, the villains get what they deserve and so on. My problem is that most of the characters that die either had no backstory, like all the random people we simply did not care for, or had it coming in a way. Zara did not, and she'd being way too developed to be killed off in the most horrifying death of the whole movie.. We know that she's been ordered to follow some kids she doesn't even know for a whole day as part of her job, she sure can be a little pissed about that. We know she has a wedding planned and is working some stuff out with her fiancee. Later in the movie when Claire calls her she's nervous and scared because she can't find the kids. It might be because she's worried about them or she's worried about her job, but she did something wrong and already regrets it. The next time we see her she's being tortured by pteros and swallowed by a Mosa which means she probably's still alive inside him. That's pretty damn brutal.  Ok TLDR my point being she didn't deserve this death and if she was to be killed anyway they should make us care less for her and/or give her a lesser death.  Seriously I liked this movie but I couldn't stop thinking about that one moment, it stayed in my head in a bad way. That's not exactly the thing you want to remember from a movie like that :P"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,npcdel,4,Sat Jun 20 12:39:28 2015 UTC,"I want to take a shot in the dark about this death and guess that maybe, just maybe, it was part of a cut-out scene.  I'm guessing that in early drafts of the script/unedited footage, the filmmakers were trying to depict Zara as someone unlikable or at least annoying and thus you'd want to see her killed (which comes with its own amount of baggage but at least it's contextualized). But, in editing, they felt that Zara took too much screentime and cut out her scenes EXCEPT the death scenes because they kind of liked it. Only without the context, it isn't showing someone you hate die, but an innocent bystander die.  I can't really confirm this, but that's my best guess."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,th1smustbetheplace,6,Sun Jun 21 13:47:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for posting that. It stuck in my mind after the film too. The two children she was meant to be minding were watching her death and their reaction or lack thereof was such that it almost came across as an 'evil chick gets her comeuppance' moment, which was really undeserved. It would have been a more appropriate death for the villain, who was even given the dignity of being killed off screen, but even then ..."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Cerebrist,5,Mon Jun 22 09:35:15 2015 UTC,"Ill get down voted for this. I think what it was trying to show with this scene is how chaotic that moment was. Zara was the only one to get capture on filmed that this happened to, but it was brutal moment and I am sure others met this fate. I think he was trying to show, shit can JUST HAPPEN in a situation like this. Dinosaurs are fucking beasts, they are brutal and they are so much larger, stronger, faster than us and he shows all of that in this scene. We are helpless everyone wants to help her, no one wants to watch her go through that. You wanted a reaction? You are reacting! It just fucking sucks what happened to her, but it can and did happen to people. Dinosaurs are brutal and will destroy us."

They get points for capturing the thrill of a dinosaur attack, and her death was brutal, which made it awesome in a sense. Where my problem crops up is how the Mosasaur was a hero in the end...because if that is the case, someone more evil should have died. But again, Dinosaurs are brutal and are thinking ""we need to eat."" They don't care what is right and what is wrong!"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,JurijFedorov,14,Thu Jun 25 17:47:16 2015 UTC,"I thought the movie treated women horribly in general. Going in, I was aware that there was some debate about Bryce Dallas Howard's high heels, but I wasn't expecting so much of the plot to be so infuriating. I felt like the movie was just heaping punishment and criticism on its female characters for having jobs and/or not being interested in children.  Ethical implications aside, Claire appears to be very good at what she does, and managing a massive international attraction on a private island is obviously a demanding job. But the exposition is primarily invested in pointing out her failings as an aunt (?) and as a romantic prospect for Owen. I'm certainly used to seeing women criticized for being inadequate mothers, but I think this is the first time I've seen a female character chastised for being a failure as an aunt. And when it comes to the romantic pairing, Joss Whedon was right - they leaned on a tired old trope. It's like the writers shrugged and said, ""Hey, opposites attract, right?""   Claire's story arc isn't resolved until she's stripped of all of the symbols of her professional life (the crisp white suit, her sleek hair, and her allegiance to Masrani and the Jurassic World empire) and placed firmly in a maternal role: in the last scene, she's holding her nephews in the evacuation facility, she's been reunited with her sister and brother-in-law, and she's partnered with Owen.  I also thought the movie's depiction of the boys' mom (Judy Greer) was bizarre. She's shown crying while on the phone at her place of business, which seems to be a law firm or some other corporate office, in full view of a large group of colleagues and/or clients who are waiting for her to join a meeting. Look, I can suspend my disbelief when it comes to the dinosaur cloning, and Chris Pratt being the Cesar Milan of raptors. But in corporate America, you don't cry in front of your entire team while taking a personal call.  So given the offensive portrayals of women at work that had already been included in the film, I wasn't surprised that Zara was ostensibly tortured and killed for not being a good enough babysitter. If Trevorrow's intention with her death was to signal that he would be rejecting the morality-based fatality model of the rest of the franchise, then he should have 1) actually developed her character, or 2) excised the sexism from the rest of the script, because it doesn't read like a random, tragic death in the larger context of the film. Plus, the rest of the characters who die ARE ""bad guys"" getting their comeuppance: Hoskins is a warmonger and a manipulative asshole, and Masrani is doomed by his hubris, both in genetically modifying dinosaurs and flying a helicopter without a license. If Trevorrow wanted to really blow everyone's minds with the news that bad things can happen to good characters in an action franchise, he should have offed one of those kids.  Edited for clarity."

I think some of the bones of my critique of that scene still stand - get your game face on, Judy Greer!   I really enjoyed your comment, and I think you're right - it's a very socially conservative movie in a lot of ways, both in its gender dynamics and an insistence on natural order: ultimately, the ""real"" dinosaurs that take down the engineered hybrid.

Someone at /r/movies explained it away by saying that they cut away a scene where she acted like a jerk - and that made people calm down. We are so used to only bad guys dying horrible deaths that we get mad at the director for not following that troppe. This is the interesting discussion here. Why do we dislike movies that don't follow all the old troppes?

""We"" aside - maybe it's because movies present structures we can hang our lives on.   If we watch a film where life events have reason - that people get what they deserve or work for, and that people who are ""nice"" get rewards - it reassures us by giving us a template or format through which to view the real world (or should I say, provides us with a fictional narrative that helps obscure the real world).  The old tropes are still there because they are comforting. And in a ""popcorn movie"" like Jurassic World people don't really want to be pushed or challenged. They want to be distracted, horrified - but led safely out of the tunnel at the end, with the world back as it should be. Hence obsession with fictional concepts such as ""closure"" and ""arcs"" in both reality and screenplay.  In real life, that nice guy in the neighbourhood who helps everyone out, has a job as a fireman, and does charity work in his spare time - he's the guy who gets involved in a car crash and then gets cancer."

There is at least 10000 movies with the basic story structure. Watch one of them! Don't hate on a movie daring to do something new."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Slickrickkk,3,Fri Jun 19 10:07:08 2015 UTC,"I had kinda hoped that, with ""everything alway available"" via DVD and Netflix and comparable sources, we might be freed from this. Not too long ago, films basically disappeared after their theatre run. That's not true anymore. That's why [technological] remakes don't make so much sense (from a longer-term business perspective).  Music has already become ""all time, now"" with people's tastes broadening and becoming age-independent (both in terms of the listener's age, and the era of the music). Eventually this will become true of film? Will that lead to a loosening of these self-enforced limitations?  Maybe it'll take a while?  To be honest, I fear the situation won't change anyway. Film speaks more directly to our ""reality tunnels"", we are more sensitive to them. It's not just about ""entertainment"" or ""escapism""; there's something else going on here. Meanwhile, the business has a far more fixed set of ideas and received wisdom about what ""should"" happen in a story or script - even as they fail to do proper pre-production and so mangle this."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,DaEvil1,5,Fri Jun 19 10:21:57 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Zara's death was made brutal to let us have an 'empathy' towards the deaths. She's a good choice to kill as she is, firstly, not an unimportant person like a random person in the crowd. If an unimportant person was to be killed, we would probably feel nothing. Her being a slightly important character makes sure we as audience can feel an empathy or anger towards. Secondly, like what you said,she is chosen because her 'sins' are not proportional at all. In Nightcrawler, remember how Nina was saying something like how an innocent, white man of the suburbs being killed has a greater impact on the audience. I think the same is achieved here.The writers want us to feel that empathy towards a person getting killed, Zara being a perfect choice, without too much harm to the plot.  Another point to make is that the dinosaurs should be seen as the central characters. And in many movies, we see the main characters doing something good after committing evil at the end of the movie, as a form of catharsis. The raptors turned on the military men, an 'evil' deed, and afterwards 'redeemed' themselves when they helped Chris Pratt. Same can be said of the mosasaur, the evil deed being eating Zara.   I am just trying to find, like you, some purpose in this. My analysis obviously falls short: the mosasaur appeared too few times to be a central character and the pterodactyls probably were more evil but no 'catharsis' present. The writers obviously want a sequel (with the lack of closure about inGen and Wu), so maybe the mosasaur will have a greater role (with the t-rex and pterodactyls) in the coming films. Or we will learn that Zara was secretly an evil person in bed with inGen operatives abusing the mosasaur and that the death was indeed proportional."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,mynameismarkcarlos,5,Thu Jun 18 14:56:38 2015 UTC,"I think what everyone in the thread seems to be missing is that it's a sequel to a Spielberg film. What do we remember most from his films? The one, singular, horrifyingly brutal death randomly placed within the plot somewhere. The first kill by the shark in Jaws (she's gasping for air and you know why, but you can't see the shark because it's offscreen). The lawyer eaten by the T-Rex as he sits on the toilet in Jurassic Park. Faces melting off in Raiders of the Lost Ark. He always puts that one scene in there to really fuck with the audience. Trevorrow had to live up to that. You can't build the sequel to a movie like that without throwing in your own scene. He admitted it himself, when he was interviewed about the scene; the idea was to create one scene so intensely horrific but yet something you could identify with, something you could watch happening and imagine to some very vivid degree that it was happening to you. Something that so rabidly attacked your psyche that it bypassed your emotions entirely and gave you a sense of dread.  What he's done is brought back the true horror scene, where you THINK you know what's going to happen next, only to have the stakes change at the last second, drawing out the suspense in such a way that it literally horrifies you until you're uncomfortable. No quiet suspense scene interrupted by a loud noise and a scary face, no weird string instruments playing bass lines to build up tension; just a character you thought might get out of this alive, suddenly and brutally removed from the plot. It's so true to Spielberg's best scenes that I could have credited the man himself with it.  But no, it was Trevorrow who built that horrorfest. And you know what he thinks about all the people airing their distaste? ""You can imagine it happening to you. It's awful, what happens [in the Jurassic World scene] and yet, look - you're the one that came to a dinosaur island. What did you expect?"""
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,DSPR,22,Sat Jun 27 02:09:51 2015 UTC,"That was my main problem with the movie too. I know it's a dinosaur/disaster movie and people are going to die. Blood will be shed. But, like you said, her death was very inconsistent with the tone of the film. It was all mostly PG stuff with splashes of tomato paste, but having a minor character like Zara (whose sins aren't in line with the gruesomeness of her demise) have such a drawn-out and upsetting death was definitely weird. If Vincent D'onofrio died in a similar way, this wouldn't be an issue."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,QuirkyGroundhog,19,Tue Jun 16 21:07:03 2015 UTC,"It was definitely a drastic change in tone, and I don't think it worked. But I think it's the same reason Coulson had to die in Avengers; there had to be a sense of realism/danger and 'rising stakes' for the plot. Having the pterosaurs released onto the park would definitely up the stakes, and having someone die in a very, very drawn out (almost torturous) manner would amplify that even more.  For me, it didn't work for a couple of reasons;  1 - Zara was there for three(?) scenes, severely limiting any emotional connection I had to her in that moment. I forgot she even existed because she was really just a walking plot point. Her death simply forced Claire to be with her nephews, which didn't really hold a massive dramatic impact because you could see where that arc was going from the first moment she appears.  2 - The sequence was obviously designed as a moment of popcorn cinema; it's a big trailer moment with the pterosaurs and it's really the moment everything becomes 'real' to the park-goers. I think it makes sense to have a death scene, and I like the idea of killing an innocent to show the savage nature of the dinosaurs. It raises the stakes in an interesting way. But to do that, you have to shift the entire tone to something more sombre and serious; which they did not do. So we have the running of the people, then this graphic death, and then we're back to our heroes doing heroic things and getting out of scrapes in escalating ways. It's an odd progression. It felt like a guy going to a child's birthday party and dancing, then stopping to shoot a puppy, and then making balloon animals and trying to act like the guy you knew at the start of the party. You can't quite recover from the sudden turn.  I thought it was a very well-done moment, and my favourite death in the movie, but it was very much out of place in context of the entire movie. I can't help but wonder if her death due to Claire's inadvertant incompetence will play a part in a future sequel. I doubt it, but it's possible.  TL;DR: I think if they had padded out Zara's character slightly, and made this death the 'tonal turning point' of Jurassic World, it would have been more meaningful and less mindlessly horrific."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,mynameismarkcarlos,11,Wed Jun 17 00:51:43 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU! Yes, you explained it perfectly. It had that extreme tonal shift for a brief moment, then wanted to return to home base like nothing happened. I had no problem with the death, just its place in the entire movie."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,QuirkyGroundhog,3,Wed Jun 17 02:36:35 2015 UTC,"I think you put it succinctly here. You make two excellent points. Katie McGrath's character, Zara, was not fleshed out much other than a few lines. This could have been a focal death in the movie yet it stings with audiences. I believe the problem with Zara's cruel and horrific death is not so much a question of whether she ""deserved"" to live or die. As in real life, we have control over processes not outcomes. Rather, character-wise, Zara was an underdeveloped persona who perhaps did not warrant such a cruel and horrific death, coming from a woman whose limited scenes disrupted the emotional connection from the audience. I disagree with the notion that she was a slob who had abandoned the kids. It is clear that she was not as she relentlessly searched for them in the midst of chaos and cautioned them before her final moments.   Had the next scenes shifted scene afterwards, perhaps having the lead protagonists reflect on her demise and if the film shifted tone to something somber, then we might have something here. That did not occur. She is completely forgotten for the rest of the film despite the fact that she is not background fodder either. She is given a name. That alone holds weight. Yet no effort is made to tie up any loose ends at any point afterwards.    As a set piece, it was a disturbing yet well done scene that was executed well. The camera pans around as Zara already knows her fate for what seems to be an eternity. Perhaps it succeeds it getting audiences agape and horrified. But it also leaves a sour taste in the mouth as it also highlights a flaw in the movie's character development. It is mindlessly horrific scene in terms of its context within the movie as a whole. In retrospect, I do feel that the scene lacked a proper setup and denouement which limited its potential and reduced its effectivity."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,GomezTheDragon,2,Thu Jun 18 14:44:41 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the notion that she was a slob who had abandoned the kids. It is clear that she was not as she relentlessly searched for them in the midst of chaos and cautioned them before her final moments.   I agree completely. I was slightly unclear in my post, but I was referring to her initial action of hiring the babysitter as incompetance, rather than the search. She didn't abandon the kids really, at all, but just hired someone to look after them. She tried and succeeded in fixing the problem, but it was her avoidance that set everything off."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,TriumphantGeorge,3,Thu Jun 18 21:56:27 2015 UTC,"Her death simply forced Claire to be with her nephews, which didn't really hold a massive dramatic impact because you could see where that arc was going from the first moment she appears.   Maybe that was the point. That could've been Claire had she been with her nephews like she should've been. Instead she has to stay in this living hell that she is somewhat responsible for. It seems like the filmmakers had a missed opportunity here."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,GomezTheDragon,3,Wed Jun 17 06:29:27 2015 UTC,I think Speed did that concept really well with Sandra Bullock feeling survivor guilt amongst other things at one point. There was no incling of that in this movie.
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,TriumphantGeorge,2,Thu Jun 18 21:38:59 2015 UTC,"I hadn't considered that, but now that you mention it, I can see how that could have been the intention. I think the filmmakers missed quite a few opportunities to clarify moments, but that's a very good example."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,GomezTheDragon,23,Wed Jun 17 09:11:27 2015 UTC,"So I just saw Jurassic World and I don't think I've felt that sick in my stomach from a movie.   What films have you watched before? Honestly. I understand your argument that she didn't deserve to die. I agree with it, actually! I understand your argument that her death wasn't consistent with the tone of the film too. I disagree with that point. But her death wasn't as bad, brutal, or unfair as a number of other deaths in films and TV shows.    For those who may not have seen the film, you may be asking, ""well what about the other deaths? Maybe the film was trying to make a point with all the brutality?""    Colin Trevorrow was trying to be subversive. From an interview with Entertainment:   In the end, the earned death in these movies has become a bit standard and another thing I wanted to subvert. ""How can we surprise people? Let's have someone die who doesn't deserve to die at all.""   But he was trying to be subversive for the sake of being subversive. He failed."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,TriumphantGeorge,25,Tue Jun 16 23:14:16 2015 UTC,"It's not that it was objectively the most horrible death ever put to screen, it was the context of the entire movie. There have been plenty of more gratuitous deaths in horror and action movies, but they effectively world build to make it seem likely that it would happen. In Fury, we see bodies run over by tanks, a part of a face on the ground, and an innocent teenage girl get killed by mortar fire. But it was set in a brutal world and makes it clear right away."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,ilovefrankee,2,Tue Jun 16 23:20:21 2015 UTC,"I hear you. But as I went into in more detail in my main comment, I've noticed that cruelty and unfairness is a minor theme in most Spielberg movies. Nobody talks about it, compared to the box office numbers and all his pro-family themes, his mastery of the film craft overall. But many of his movies (whether as director or merely ""producer"") have those moments of cruelty."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Mareeck,4,Wed Jun 17 01:01:18 2015 UTC,"That's a misleading part of the quotation, immediately before it he describes her as a Bridezilla and mentions her being a buzzkill on the phone to her fiancee. The quote tries to have it both ways which puts me much more in mind with ""No, totally, now that I've read your comments I'm going to retroactively say this was intended and was sequel set up"" Snyder."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,mrstovely,3,Wed Jun 17 08:14:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know what he wrote before, but I don't think what I quoted is misleading. You can read what I quoted, cross check it against the film, and see he's ""subverting"" the films rather poorly. With the added quote, you're left with the same conclusion, but with a not as relevant ""oh he's trying to have things both ways.""  How is that misleading? The original question isn't ""Is Trevorrow trying to have that scene both ways?"" It's ""Was that scene bad or not and why?"""
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Snaket,4,Wed Jun 17 14:10:37 2015 UTC,"Because the body of what Trevorrow says does not support his stated conclusion, and neither does the scene in question, so we can't just take his conclusion as truth. Even if one does believe his conclusion, removing the earlier part of the statement eliminates the context necessary for the reader to come to that alternative, reasonable belief."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,mrstovely,6,Wed Jun 17 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you and thought that the death was significantly awful. I thought it was exploitative and had no need to be in the movie. The thing is that dinosaurs were killing everybody, and you have to imagine that everyone else is probably getting killed in similarly awful ways, but they aren't shown, just implied. I mean you see a few people get hurt and probably die but nothing like Zara. It seemed completely out of place and I think it would have made more sense if they beat her up really badly then was still alive at the end but with significant injuries. She could be getting interviewed by a news reporter or something. I know it's cliche but so is what actually happened to her (and the whole movie in general)."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Snaket,2,Wed Jun 17 18:01:22 2015 UTC,"I think it would have made more sense if they beat her up really badly then was still alive at the end but with significant injuries.   In what way would it have ""made more sense""? As in, more true to the logic of real life? Or ""more sense"" as in movie-world-sense, following the usual tropes of feel-good movie-world?"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,mrstovely,2,Fri Jun 19 08:44:36 2015 UTC,"The latter. ""More Sense"" in keeping with the movie's themes, chiches, tropes etc."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Snaket,3,Sat Jun 20 03:37:36 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean but - I don't think films should necessarily be bound by those ""cliches of analysis"".   The scene obviously has an intense effect, and maybe is part of a (hypothetical) better version of the film. The problem is that it's in a film which is all over the place anyway, in terms of tone and story and themes.  The same errors are made throughout the movie. This scene stands out because of the death aspect, but other scenes - character interactions - are just as out of place and jarring, just less visually dramatic, and so less imprinted on the mind.If the film had been more coherent overall, I don't think we'd be discussing it like this.   With a film that's so committee-based (multiple writes, messy script, studio-mandated aspects, limited director control) I wonder whether this is one of the few scenes where Treverrow got to actually direct something properly - being less scripted - but then that makes it stylistically jarring also."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,mrstovely,3,Sat Jun 20 08:04:00 2015 UTC,"Those are definitely good points. My reaction is mostly coming from the fact that the movie was probably mediocre, decent at best. You're right about it being all over the place. There's also all sorts of plot details that are forgotten, ignored and a lot of things that don't really make sense from a character motivation standpoint. BUT, despite a lot of it being silly, the only part that really made me feel bad/uncomfortable (in a bad way, i know this can be a powerful feeling for films to illicit in other circumstances) was Zara's death, just because it was SO out of place. I would rather have had some crappy, predictable ending compared to her death scene, but if the whole movie was a little more intense (and the characters actually REACTED to her death) the scene in the movie probably would have been a lot better,  I definitely agree with you that consistency is the key."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Snaket,3,Sat Jun 20 17:12:29 2015 UTC,"You make a good point on the character reaction. One additional scene, placed almost anywhere in the film, could have taken care of it.  Literally a three second sequence later on where one of the boys looked upset, cried and said: ""Z-z-z-zara!"", and we wouldn't be talking about this.  Not because it would have been good storytelling, it just would have integrated the scene into the movie overall rather than it seeming like a standalone CGI set piece which wasn't in the script.  Overall, this film was a missed opportunity for a more intense and more nuanced take on JP while still being a blockbuster.  I mean, we are all inclined to say this occasionally as dedicated film enthusiasts, but this is actually a case where I feel if it'd been given to me for a couple of weeks to redraft, I could have turned out something more coherent and satisfying. Which really just means that even after all the years of development, probably the script wasn't actually finished when they started shooting."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,mrstovely,3,Sat Jun 20 17:34:11 2015 UTC,"Zara's death scene also stood out to me on viewing and similarly afterwards it was one of our group's first discussion points. One thing I haven't seen mentioned here was the death scene for the security guard of Indominus Rex. Coming quite early in the film, its depiction was deliberately violent and the subsequent display of the dinosaur's gore-strewn teeth reinforced this effect."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Snaket,3,Wed Jun 17 15:39:34 2015 UTC,"I think that scene was what people try to explain as the Zara scene. The death of the security guard was the one that showed us how dangerous the dinosaurs are and all that, not Zara. Her death was way out of place for the general tone of the movie."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,hellothisisdoor,3,Sat Jun 20 12:46:25 2015 UTC,"That death for her was so messed up. Ugh... I think I could tolerate her being swallowed whole and a alive, although I would much prefer if she really did have to die, that the mosasaur bit her in half instead of swallowing her. The idea of her suffering in the stomach is way too much for me to handle. In addition she suffered a whole lot with the flying dinosaurs tormenting, dropping her, drowning her and when it carried her in its mouth, who knew how many bones broke? So not only was she almost drowing, she might have suffered multiple injuries from the assault, and only to be squeezed down an esophagus and probably drown in bile. It hurts my brain thinking about it. The actress was totally down with it though and gave it 100%. :S   TL;DR I could find her death more acceptable if the birds just dropped her into the stomach of the mosasaur as opposed to them torturing her beforehand although I would MUCH rather at the end, if the mosasaur decided to regurgitate her alive and unharmed... :("
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,musicrages,2,Sat Jun 20 00:24:52 2015 UTC,"Regurgitate her? Now you're just going overboard with the pornographic way she died lol. I think she might have suffocated in the stomach even so. Honestly, I think she would prefer being chomped down, than having to be puked out or excreted alive."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,lukas8u,3,Sat Jun 20 17:43:02 2015 UTC,I'm just saying she should survive or die immediately instead of being digested alive. I'm not sure how that's pornographic when it's just really gross. :/
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Splutch,4,Sat Jun 20 18:39:27 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah indeed. Well to calm your mind, the thing is, she won't actually be digested alive in that sense. She would be swallowed whole, so there will be a moment of life where she is aware that she is being smothered in stomach bile, constricted in the stomach and unable to breathe. Chances are the gastric acrid would kill her almost immediately. My doctor friend said that, but yeah, I still need to do some research on that. Well, regardless, if that is the case she won't actually be alive during the digestion like the pit in return of the jedi. She would have passed before I imagine, but again, there will definitely be a moment or two where she is aware it is happening."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,lukas8u,3,Sun Jun 21 23:48:29 2015 UTC,"hmm, when I think about it like it's not quite as bad, but pteranodons(spelling?) tormenting her is probably what makes me the most upset, I could probably accept her being swallowed alive and assume the second row of teeth killed her and be like ""ooooh... Damn."" but being dropped back and forth, drowned, dunked and chomped on by a beak and THEN swallowed was just way too much, I'm not sure why the director had to be so full force with that scene, especially for someone who didn't really deserve it. Usually when randoms are killed, it's quick and shocking. This death was almost as if the director hated snooty young British girls or something..."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Riderz_of_Brohan,2,Mon Jun 22 00:26:30 2015 UTC,"Pteradactyls or Pteranodons (I think that's how you spell (Teranodine. I should do some research on Teranodines and Terodactils).   Yeah. My beef is that she was tortured. Yes, she was innocent. Dinosaurs don't care who is right and wrong, they just want to eat. So in that regard, I could let it go. What steamed me was people clapping that the Mosasaur came back in the end as the hero. If he is a hero, he should kill someone deserving. The I-Rex yes... Zara no. That being said, I probably would be way okay if Claire cared... the boys were like freaked out... ""ZUH ZUH ZARA.... BIRD... ZUH ZUH ZARA.... BIRD... THE TUH TUH TANK... AND THE MO MO... TANK... MOSASAUR... ZARA!!! ZARAAAA!!!!"" Instead, her death is ignored. Otherwise, I would be fine if it was her. MOSASAURUS IS NOT A HERO!!!   Check out a fan fiction I found lol. It's really nice to see her get some kind of care."

TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Snaket,3,Wed Jun 24 16:25:17 2015 UTC,"I got that it was a way to show that the dinosaurs are just wild animals, not the theme Park attractions they try to get branded as in the movie. This is also where, at least for me, the movie kind of shifted in tone. This was the part where they passed the point of safe return in terms of salvaging the park, as now that the tourists know the Dino's are out and have been injured (as well as Zara killed).  Though it was fairly brutal, you don't actually see Zara getting eaten, you only see the Pteradon getting  eaten.   I think another reason why so many people react the way they to do this death is that it isn't something thats been seen in the franchise before. Would it still have been as brutal if the Pteradon had just impaled her in the water as we had already seen with Billy in JP3? IMHO I think the reaction would be a little different. The other thing was this is the first female death in the franchise, so part of me does believe that Trevorrow did this to kill two birds with one stone (using the Mesosaur again and first female death). All in all, though it seems like a pretty shitty way to die I don't think it was necessarily more brutal than other deaths in the series. Why does no one mention the I-Rex paddock worker in terms of brutality and undeserved deaths? The I-Rex made it impossible to be seen and had it not been for him, Owen Grady wouldn't have been able to escape the paddock. The way he got eaten was pretty gruesome.  Also, Eddie Carr in TLW? The guy barely interfered with the dinosaurs, let alone do harm yet he gets torn in half. That was the worst one for me.  So basically, though I agree that it was a brutal death, I would not put it at the most gruesome, and think a lot of people are overreacting."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Elder_Yautja,10,Sun Jun 21 22:23:05 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna get the ""stupid SJW"" backlash in a heartbeat, but something about that death scene struck me as a tad misogynistic and mean-spirited.   This is a movie that has some pretty lame statements to make about gender issues, and killing off the stereotypical ""inattentive bitch"" character in such a way left a bad taste in my mouth."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,LinkDrive,3,Wed Jun 17 14:44:31 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, an important part of correcting sexism is having women make up half the people in the movie. So it was great to see these women in lots of roles, big and small (assistant, control room, executive manager etc).   I don't think it was a moral play, in a post-game of thrones media landscape (where any character can die, especially those you love most) that kind of simple good/evil stuff doesn't fly anymore. Even the 'evil' military guy got to make persuasive (albeit darwin-capitalist) arguments to Owen.   Many more men died than women. I'm a woman, and I felt shocked by the death just because I could be that girl much more than I could relate to the 'macho' male secondary characters since their jobs are more physical animal handling/security/soldier. I didn't feel too bad about the first few guys that died, but when Zara got killed, the terror the tourists felt really hit me-- it's not just spectacle, they're running for their lives in a huge crises. Like people running from a terrorist attack, the desperation of what's happening hit me because someone like ME got killed painfully."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Snaket,4,Thu Jun 18 00:30:50 2015 UTC,"When it's done to a man it's fine, when it happens to a woman  it's ""misogynistic"" and a moral problem."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,dodus,9,Wed Jun 17 16:32:39 2015 UTC,No one in the movie got a death as brutal as hers
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,tnt-bizzle,3,Wed Jun 17 16:35:23 2015 UTC,I think it's more to the point to out of dozens of people she is the first woman to actually get killed and I think that's a reason why people are focusing on the death  I don't think people would bring this up as much if it were another male henchmen or something
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,twinarteriesflow,4,Fri Jun 19 16:40:58 2015 UTC,If it happened to a male henchman it would have just been jarring and looked weird.   Because the death was pointless and over the top
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,tnt-bizzle,2,Fri Jun 19 18:21:06 2015 UTC,It was done awkwardly but I think it was to further demonstrate the random chaos of the scene
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,SatanSenpai,2,Fri Jun 19 18:31:39 2015 UTC,"The why it happened wasn't random. But everything else about it made no sense. You don't just kill off plot related characters without a purpose, especially in a movie like jurassic park"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Snaket,5,Fri Jun 19 19:09:56 2015 UTC,"During the movie, the entire series, and plenty of action movies, most people get a death directly proportional to their sins.    You see, this is exacly the problem; Colin Trevverow (sp?) is playing on that cliche and twisting it.  Her death was horrible and also very random because sometimes that just happens to people.  Those fuckin birds were terrorizing the entire crowd.  Tons of people probably died horribly but we just didn't see it.    The ""Hans Gruber""-type bad guy doesn't always die in a super ""satisfactory"" way proportionate to how shitty they were because it's unrealistic.    She didn't deserve to die such a horrible, painful death.  And yet she did.  Because nature is a cold, brutal beast, and it does what it wants.  She just got in the way."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,jonathanaltman,10,Wed Jun 17 06:47:40 2015 UTC,"You see, this is exacly the problem; Colin Trevverow (sp?) is playing on that cliche and twisting it. Her death was horrible and also very random because sometimes that just happens to people.    Then why not kill off a character we wouldn't expect, instead of a ""character"" who is really nothing more than an extra with a name?  The only reason Zara's death is a surprise is we forgot she was even in the movie.  If you're trying to subvert expectations and show that anyone can be killed, then why not kill one of the kid brothers?  Why not kill him in the same flippant, sadistic manner, for our morbid amusement?"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,awaiting_AWake,5,Wed Jun 17 12:56:41 2015 UTC,"I was so steamed when she died and Claire saw the boys and hugged them. She didn't ask about Zara, who called her and said she found the boys, nor did the boys tell her, ""The baby...sitt.... Zuh zuh... zara... she... Tank... Mosasaur... Zuh Zuh Zara... bird... took her... she she... the tank... Zara... she fell in...The Mosasaur.. THE MOSASAUR!! sobs""  Claire: Zara! Oh god.. no.. Zara!!!  Then have Claire break down too. SOMETHING.   Instead, they are cool. ""IS THAT AUNT CLAIRE!!!"" when she shoots the dinosaur.   ""Who is that guy?"" When Owen and Claire kissed.   ""We are sticking with him! Definitely him!""  YEAH. The kids did not have a traumatic experience did they?"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,sfinney2,9,Sat Jun 20 18:02:59 2015 UTC,"But not showing others getting killed makes her death feel out of place. And I'm not asking for everyone to get what they deserve, good or bad. I'm just saying her death broke the internal consistency of the world. Every other character had a death that was fairly proportional.   Beyond her simply dying, the way the camera followed her was just cruel. It's one thing to kill her, but having her die in such a horrific way without any character mourning over her simply feels odd. It was a horror movie moment inside a predominantly action movie"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,sfinney2,5,Wed Jun 17 06:56:15 2015 UTC,"Zara's death was a little intense for a movie that is, lets be honest, aimed at a family audience, but I do get the feeling no one would give a shit if she wasn't young, female, and hot. If she was a he, no one would care. If she was fat, it would be considered darkly comical. Also, she was eaten by a fucking DINOSAUR, so this is hardly realistic."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,I-HATE-REDDITORS,3,Sun Jun 21 00:30:28 2015 UTC,"The only reason why her death stuck out, at least to me, is because of how drawn out her death was compared to all the abrupt and sudden deaths throughout the movie. Rather than crunching down on her like what happened with everyone else, she was swooped up, fumbled, dropped, dive bombed, fumbled some more, swooped up again, and then finally eaten. Maybe if the whole pterodactyl scene wasn't so chaotic in general, her death wouldn't have stood out so much. Hell, if it were me, I probably would have shortened it to her just being swooped up and then either dropped by accident into the mosasaraus's mouth, or the mosasaraus straight up intercepting the pterodactyl.  But I do believe you are right. If it wasn't an attractive young female, nobody would have cared. It seems all the ""horrific"" and ""gruesome"" deaths are expected to be reserved for male characters."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,tapomirbowles,3,Tue Jun 23 04:17:27 2015 UTC,"I gotta agree with you a bit. When the fat security officer was cowering behind the truck. People were chuckling in the cinema and I felt like it was unfair. Zara, well... why does she get so much care? You are right, it's because she is pretty etc. Maybe some guys are dwelling on it too much because it turns them on, seeing a hot chick screaming, being pecked and then possibly suffering a few seconds before she dies lol. There is a narcissistic envious trait in all of us, where we are happy when famous people fall, in that it sort of reflects that we are better. So I guess, for some (not the guys turned on) seeing a hot woman sort of die in that fashion, with the idea of her probably becoming Dinosaur excrete, makes people feel better about themselves too lol.   Her death, was intense, but I guess my issue with it was that nobody cared she died. The boys reacted, but didn't tell Claire who didn't even ask about her"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,sfinney2,2,Sun Jun 21 22:00:53 2015 UTC,"Bingo.  Notice how no one is talking about Masrani crashing in the helicopter, even in threads like this where it absolutely should be a counterpoint of sorts, and even though he was more likable and probably deserved to die even less.  Why?  Not young. Not female.  Well, kind of hot."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,JurijFedorov,4,Wed Jun 24 20:51:01 2015 UTC,"The scene was making a point with all the brutality like you pointed out. Your response to this line of reasoning is that no one else gets this kind of death. I think having this type of death for one person is enough to get the point across that dinosaurs are dangerous. You'd be beating a dead horse by constantly showing a bunch of gruesome deaths.  You also addressed that maybe the death scene should've been for a villain, so the morality matches. The problem with that would be that we would be happy and root for the dinosaurs to tear apart the victim. That wasn't what Colin wanted us to feel. We all know she didn't deserve that death, and that's why it's frightening. You can't kill a villain like that and make it scary.   PS: I understand it does feel misplaced; the tone of that scene is undeniable completely different than the rest of the movie. But I think you may be a little harsh on it."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,dismemberedalive,8,Wed Jun 17 03:32:42 2015 UTC,"But isn't it kinda cheap that the I. Rex, which was literally stated in the film as being bred to be ""crueler,"" doesn't kill anyone in as drawn out and gruesome of a fashion as Zara's death? It's just plain inconsistent."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Barloq,3,Wed Jun 17 06:11:53 2015 UTC,"Oh yea, that's true. Well that's all I had, so I'll submit to that logic"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Mareeck,5,Wed Jun 17 20:12:26 2015 UTC,"My favorite part of the film, and possibly the only good part of it that was even remotely believable.  I can't believe a movie about dinosaurs killing humans had only one scene like that. All the other deaths did not have to be so long and drawn out, but should definitely have been on-screen and gruesome.   As an audience member, am I supposed to be scared of kosher, off-screen deaths with no blood?  Or am I only supposed to feel scared only if I'm a ""bad person"", because dinosaurs apparently only kill people that are seen as an antagonist in some imaginary plot that envelops our lives?  Overall, I felt the scene really fleshed out the horror of being killed by giant animals more than any other scene in the movie, and the fact that she was a minor character is forgiven because that was the most honest scene in Jurassic World and no other character was taken as seriously; even the Indian guy and Kingpin had their moments of death off-screen."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,pgibso,2,Wed Jun 17 12:44:32 2015 UTC,"I think an underwater scene with the Mosasaur was needed for suspense. Zara's death though, the movie makers managed to get us talking about it and analysing it, which makes it awesome. Perhaps though, it would have been fairer, if other people fell in the water as well. Then under the water, we witness the Mosasaur coming up in the background. Perhaps chasing the few birds away from the surface or eating them. Then show the people in the water, Zara included, having mass panic. Attempt to swim away... help each other. Then have the Mosasaur just swim by and devour them."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Melkaticox,2,Sat Jun 20 18:07:03 2015 UTC,"I thought it was essentially a direct rip-off of NATURE DOCUMENTARIES ABOUT SEA-DWELLING PREDATORS AND FLYING PREDATORS AND THE FISH STUCK IN THE MIDDLE.  Seriously.  Bird flies down for fish/swimming mammal, gets taken out by larger fish/croc/snake probably.  The notion that this is in bad taste, in a film wholly committed to the concept of ""nature run amok,"" seems like a failure of education.  The idea that ""the punishment fits the crime"" is absurd here.  It's a religious notion, not a guide for making films.  Zara didn't deserve her fate.  Any more than the guy who got speared, stomped, chomped, clawed, chomped, flown away and smashed to pieces and devoured, the mom who got chomped by a dimorph and then.....  Ya'll, this isn't what's called social justice.  This is what's called, ""my human body makes me think I need to protect that female.  Why didn't someone protect that female better?""  If you shut that part down, you might appreciate a gruesome and realistically pointless death in a crazy cool flick.  Because death is ALWAYS pointless, ya idealistic chumps :-) <3"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Tertlepower14,2,Sun Jun 28 08:53:19 2015 UTC,"Spoiler incoming!  Interestingly this was brought up by a friend after we saw the movie, but he instead explained the importance of it. Zara's death set the stage for end of the final I-Rex fight. Throughout the movie every major dinosaur they spent time on received a later scene where they got to shine so to speak. Though it was a pretty a pretty brutal scene, by having the Mosasaurus kill Zara it subconsciously told us that it was done with. Throughout the rest of the film your thoughts are drawn to other things that could potentially stop I-Rex, never straying back to the obviously capable Mosasaurus. When that end comes it all clicks moments before it happens with satisfying clarity."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,hey_anon,8,Sat Jul 4 21:37:39 2015 UTC,"I'm really surprised at the anti-violence backlash in response to the film. It is as if we have become overly accustomed to these toned down remakes from the 80s/90s.   I don't think there needs to be much more of a point to a character's death in this kind of movie other than it being really, really scary. Jurassic Park is Spielberg, not Disney (well until BFG).  PS don't worry about Zara, even if you initially survived being swallowed whole by a sea monster you would drown very quickly. No different than being stuck in the Titanic. So she only drowned, that's not so bad right!?"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,Ragefan66,12,Tue Jun 16 22:44:56 2015 UTC,"My problem wasn't with the violence. It's just that the tone of her death scene stuck out like a sore thumb. MiddleGround1706 explained it perfectly.   ""It's an odd progression. It felt like a guy going to a child's birthday party and dancing, then stopping to shoot a puppy, and then making balloon animals and trying to act like the guy you knew at the start of the party. You can't quite recover from the sudden turn.""  And I would disagree about not needing a point to the death. I think something like a character death should mean something, whether it be an action movie or romantic comedy.   About Zara's fate. You bring up a good point about her drowning. I'd like to think that she instantly died as the dinosaur clamped its jaws together though. Who knows lol"
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,captbollocks,4,Wed Jun 17 03:04:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely true about the poor juxtaposition with the romantic scene immediately afterwards.   As someone else said though it's not a morality play and the other films each offed ancillary characters who didn't deserve it in some of the most gruesome scenes in the movies (Eddie, the mercenary, and Samuel Jackson's arm).  I think the director also said they wanted to make the first female death very memorable and he also wanted to subvert the audience's expectations. This is what probably led him to make it both so terrifying, awesome and drawn out."
TrueFilm,3a2zj1,EnigmasShroom,8,Wed Jun 17 03:44:20 2015 UTC,"I think the director also said they wanted to make the first female death very memorable   Yeah, she got treated like a couple kids found their sister's Barbie.  One of the most worrisome things about this scene for me is the gender angle.  The movie's treatment of Claire is so bad that it's extra troubling when the only other female character with a name is abused to such a pornographic extent."
TrueFilm,3a145e,kingtao,6,Tue Jun 16 12:12:52 2015 UTC,"I think that's pretty spot on. There's some similarity to the sort of manic, desperate, sort of lonely look to the characters in Eraserhead. The look of the characters builds in the audience a sort of uncomfortable tension with maybe a hint of sympathy for them. Like, if you could just give them a nice warm bath and a haircut the world would be alright, or at least, maybe not so hostile."
TrueFilm,3a145e,adrift98,5,Tue Jun 16 14:37:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, Eraserhead. That's a perfect example. There's such an element of creepiness to it too, from practicing dentistry without a license and kissing the patient under ether to her sniffing out 3 day old meat."
TrueFilm,3a145e,leamas666,5,Tue Jun 16 14:48:16 2015 UTC,"There's some similarity to the sort of manic, desperate, sort of lonely look to the characters in Eraserhead   That's the perfect way to describe it.   Actually, Greed is just like Mulholland Drive: a project that went horribly wrong and was cobbled together, mosaic-like, from the remaining fragments. There's always a sense that something is missing, and it's very unsettling."
TrueFilm,3a145e,matter_memory,3,Tue Jun 16 19:52:01 2015 UTC,"Another one that might be comparable is Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia. Such desperate ugly characters and a vision on film like life shot through a toilet bowl. I might be overreaching a little, I don't know."
TrueFilm,3a145e,Stylobean,3,Tue Jun 16 14:56:58 2015 UTC,"The characters were so disgusting in their appearance, attitudes, mannerisms that I strongly disliked the film. Not only that but the cut I am familiar with, that tries to restore the film to its full glory with what felt like an hour of cards and still photographs explaining what is no longer actual film was the worst restoration idea for a film I've ever seen.  You really do get the sense that these people are from some kind of a nightmare..."
TrueFilm,3a145e,matter_memory,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:01:41 2015 UTC,I don't like that type of restoration either. The only one that I've seen where they use stills to recreate what was lost is London After Midnight and I could not sit through it. This version of Greed was the theatrical 140 minute print. It wasn't digitally enhanced either so it was faded and scratched which gave it an even more sinister feel.
TrueFilm,3a145e,ZeroDagger,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've wanted to see it, but it's kind of a conundrum. A lost masterpiece, and the only way to see it in a form even close to its original glory is a 4 hour cut partially made up of stills.  Perhaps I should just hope the original film shows up in  some barn in Germany. Or is there no chance of an undestroyed copy left on earth?"
TrueFilm,3a145e,WernerNepomuk,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:35:11 2015 UTC,"If you want to see it I'd recommend checking out the shorter version. Sure, it's not as the director intended but at least it would be watchable. I'm sure Stroheim would prefer that over something that is un-cinematic."
TrueFilm,39y859,TheUncleRyRy,52,Mon Jun 15 19:36:44 2015 UTC,"I'm going with Evolution (2001) even though it barely counts at a 6.0. I tend to watch it a lot for some reason. I don't remember what kind of reception it got when it was released here, but I remember really enjoying it and then being surprised every time I met someone who had never heard of it. It stars David Duchovny as a disgraced scientist teaching high-school chemistry (or biology I forget). They find a meteorite and life starts evolving from it. Eventually it threatens life on earth.   The Good    The premise is great, imo. If we do find life in space, it's likely to be microscopical, and this movie plays with that. The meteorite only has one-celled organism at first, but due to something in the atmosphere they start evolving rapidly. I love the creativity in the evolved creatures.  Lots of fun bits. The movie is a very laid-back affair and there are a few good laughs. It does not take itself remotely seriously, and that lets it get away with lots of cringe-worthy stuff. (small addendum: I liked the music a lot)    The bad    The plot is very predictable and because it is so laid-back a lot of it feels completely inconsequential. The way they save the day is really stupid, which fits with the tone, but it not funny enough. That's the general problem, perhaps, the funny bits are not quite funny enough.  Julianne Moore plays another scientist and she is stupidly clumsy. I don't know why, but her character annoys me so much. Stickler (from American Pie I forget his name) actually does a better job than her in this.    Small add: the movie has not aged well - lots of bad cgi.   To improve it would take a lot. The movie feels like it was slapped together over a beer in about twenty minutes. You'd need a sharper script, better characters (less clichés) and perhaps a twist or something at the end. Duchovny is good in it, but he plays it fairly straight around a group of comic-relief characters.   OR you could go full in the other direction and make it sillier so it would be a proper parody. As is, it feels like it sits uncomfortably in between."
TrueFilm,39y859,FassyFan,9,Mon Jun 15 21:18:38 2015 UTC,"Stickler (from American Pie I forget his name) actually does a better job than her in this.   Sean William Scott (*Stiffler) actually has great comedic timing and has shown he has a good deal of range in the last decade or so. Check out Role Models, Goon and The Promotion"
TrueFilm,39y859,Fozzworth,6,Tue Jun 16 03:46:05 2015 UTC,"Good stuff. I think Evolution should have doubled down on the humor and whimsical approach. It's like a less competent Ghostbusters film, to me, and I really think it could have benefited from going more and more over the top. OR - it could have been more 90s horror, like The Faculty and Scream, and amped up the self-awareness and homages to give it some panache. I mean, come on - look at this hilarious scene here. Professor Edward Furlong - AH!   Moore's character, if I remember correctly, was supposed to some how oddly seem weak for her love interest bit, so making her clumsy cause a female scientist is intimidating seems to be the shitty path that was chosen, I think...  I don't think a twist would be a good idea. The Faculty's twist is meh, as well as most horror film twists that aren't dead serious. I think it is fine without deviating away from the basic story, although I'm not sure how to rework that for 2015.   Thanks for sharing... I look forward to seeing this film again one day."
TrueFilm,39y859,mcjoken,3,Tue Jun 16 02:33:14 2015 UTC,"I thought Julianne Moore's character played brilliantly into the 'no one knows what the hell they're doing' vibe of the movie. a typical female lead wouldn't have worked opposite David Duchovny, she had to be fuck up like him.   also, good choice a truly underrated movie."
TrueFilm,39y859,QuirkyGroundhog,2,Tue Jun 16 02:58:08 2015 UTC,"I've been waiting for a blu-ray release of Evolution for years. Like Willem says below, I think it'll be rediscovered in a couple years, decade, whatever as a goofy but competently filmed comedy. What people forget is that Evolution was clearly marketed and intended to be a spiritual successor to Ghost Busters."
TrueFilm,39y859,farcical_me,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:06:57 2015 UTC,"Whenever I watch this movie the biggest problem that I have with it is that the love interest is completely forced and unnatural. The two main characters never actually expres interest in each other and the only way their relationship is advanced is through other characters declaring it so. Very sloppy, and it should have just been taken out IMO"
TrueFilm,39y859,willemwhitfield,0,Sun Jun 21 06:10:33 2015 UTC,"I think it will age very well, but it needs another 10 years or so before it is rediscovered. I think it will be spoken of fondly in the same breath as The Room.   The thing that Evolution got right was taking the filming seriously. Even though it is a laid back sci-fi comedy, it doesn't feel as lazy as Sharknado. The filmmakers obviously tried to make a decent film, not a purposefully bad one.   But you're right with how it could be improved."
TrueFilm,39y859,nkleszcz,23,Tue Jun 16 03:14:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, I""m going to go with 1941 (1979).  That movie got trashed upon its original release, but over time, there has been a resurgence of admiration towards this film, especially since big budget comedies are no longer seen as impossible to attain (unlike Ebert's criticisms years ago--see Men In Black and Ghostbusters), because films with multiple storylines have become more mainstream, because the country's citizens can take jokes that seem to needle facets of the country, and because that cast is fantastic.  For two things it did real well, I actually have it down to five things: 1) The music score by John Williams is among his all time greats.  It is rousing, memorable, and patriotic. 2) The special effects hold up remarkably well. 3) The Oscar nominated cinematography is fantastic. 4) The center-piece dance sequence is fantastic. 5) That cast (including Christopher Lee[!]).    Three things that it could have done better: 1) You'd have to go way down the A-List cast to find what is considered to be the lead in this film, and that would be Bobby di Cicco.  He's okay, but with a film of this stature, you really need a bigger name with a better sense of comic timing. 2) For all the focus on John Belushi in the ads, you'd think he'd have a better part.  His part is small by comparion to some of the other actors. 3) The movie settles into a realm of predictability; setup, things go crash.  There are a few zingers there, but look at how Airplane! does it: there was every conceivable type and style of joke: parody, pratfalls, visual jokes and verbal silliness.  Look at how Blazing Saddles did it: a combination of gross-out humor, odd juxtapositions, vaudevillian cheese and wry social commentary. I'm not sure how it could have increased the number of types of jokes told: the jokes were played against a straight event, one which was resonant in the eyes of many.  Would a ""1941"" satire play well with the backdrop of ""9/11""? I don't think so.  If there was a way to separate that from real events, it may have the freedom to go crazier without the jokes feeling leaden."
TrueFilm,39y859,jam66539,29,Mon Jun 15 20:11:18 2015 UTC,"Only God Forgives Directed by Nicholas Winding Refn  This one is currently at a 5.7 on imdb, which kind of surprised me honestly. I would have guessed more like a 6.5 - 7.0. Anyway, below I will try to talk about both the good and bad aspects of this film as per the topic of discussion. SPOILERS FOR ONLY GOD FORGIVES  Good Things about Only God Forgives:   This films marches to its own drum. It is not trying to be like the other revenge/crime films that have come out in the past decade or two, and I enjoy that. I think more films should be daring enough to take these kinds of leaps. Why not make a film about guilt, and the destructive nature of vengeance with Ryan Gosling as a boxer/drug dealer in Thailand? Why not have a character actually physically fight God? Why not have implied incest and Ryan Gosling sticking his hand inside his mothers sliced open abdomen in some sort of bizarre Oedipal complex manifestation? Anyway, my point is that this film reaches upwards for things that many other films wouldn't dare even imagine. Even if it can't quite grasp onto everything it aims for, I think it is admirable that it at least reaches beyond the usual genre film tropes into quite strange territory.  The colour, lighting and set design choices are absolutely amazing. This is total eye candy and even with its many flaws, I think it deserves your attention as a film fan just for its cinematic beauty alone. (Keep in mind if you do decide to watch it, I'm not saying you'll enjoy it as much as I do, I would give it roughly a 7 out of 10 myself, but regardless of your feelings about it, it is definitely worth the hour and a half to sit down and watch it even just for its technical proficiency.)   Bad Things about Only God Forgives:   Mr. Gosling needed some more freaking lines (only in a few situations though). I understand Refn going for  internal conflict and suffering, and making him into the 'strong silent' type etc. And I thought that portrayal worked exceptionally well in the 'masturbation scene' and other parts of the film, but there were scenes I think he needed more to say either to his girlfriend Mai (Yayaying Rhatha Phongam), or his mother (Crystal played by Kristin Scott Thomas). Particularly at the 'dinner scene' it would have helped redeem or humanize his character a lot to break the silence and defend Mai or himself as his mother is berating and sexually harassing them. I felt like this was a huge missed opportunity just having him stare vacantly during this scene. The dialogue that is there, is usually from Kristin Scott Thomas' character, and in the dinner scene (posted above) in particular, is at times, painfully driven to exposition. I find this bizarre since the surface plot of the film is easy as hell to understand (Drugs, Murder, Revenge, etc.) so it doesn't need to be explained much at all, and the incest subtext should never have been revealed as dinner conversion in my opinion. For one last bad thing about the film, I think I need to mention the key external factor that really hurt its standing among cinema goers. Basically, it hit the wrong market at the wrong time. After Drive, people saw Refn and Gosling partnered up again and expected something at that same 'just starting to get uncomfortably far from the main stream' type of action movie again. People wanted Drive 2. The type of film that is just at the knife's edge of mainstream and cinephile culture, the one that would push their boundaries just a few inches past Pulp Fiction and Drive.  What they got was much weirder and much less easy to digest, and I'm guessing that came as a shock to many viewers. Check out the Official UK Trailer if you want a glimpse into why I think the expectations were so skewed to begin with. Only God Forgives Official Trailer #3 is the only one I found that gets even slightly close to the weirdness of the actual film. The rest all present it as some mainstream action movie set in Thailand.   Anyways, those are just some of my thoughts on Only God Forgives, but I always love to hear from TrueFilm, so feel free to chime in!  Edit: Fixed some formatting issues."
TrueFilm,39y859,logopolys_,19,Mon Jun 15 22:50:53 2015 UTC,"I had no idea this was so poorly rated.  I loved it.  The music is fantastic throughout.  Vithaya Pansringarm is the best actor I've never heard of.  The film pulls off a very foreign and Thai feeling, despite having a western cast and Danish director.  I was entertained throughout.  Man.  5.7."
TrueFilm,39y859,jam66539,4,Tue Jun 16 01:50:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I didn't even mention the score, which is definitely a highlight. And it was the neon and red lighting cutting through the darkness of the Thai streets and boxing club that really made the atmosphere perfect for the type of film it is.  And yeah the 5.7 seems really low to me too, Personally I go back and forth between about a 7 and an 8 for this one depending on how much I let the flaws impact my rating at the time. I think it is one of my top 5 favourites of 2013 too, although Inside Llewyn Davis has the #1 spot by a mile."
TrueFilm,39y859,demontits,3,Tue Jun 16 02:12:56 2015 UTC,"Me too, it's one of my favorite recent movies,,and way better than Drive imo.  I get that people get offended or uncomfortable but to call yourself a fan of cinema, and rate it so low... just boggles my mind."
TrueFilm,39y859,nightgames,5,Tue Jun 16 02:17:02 2015 UTC,"I thought this movie was completely terrible, and uninteresting. It was so slow and it didn't have a story deserving of the time it took to tell it. As someone that liked the movie what did you actually like about it?  Also, as a fan of movies I'd rate this a 1 out of 4 stars. I seriously don't understand how anyone could like this movie."
TrueFilm,39y859,bulcmlifeurt,6,Tue Jun 16 02:51:25 2015 UTC,"Not the person you're responding to but I liked it.   It's definitely a slow burn, so I could understand people not liking it for that reason alone and that's fine. The slow pace works for me because there's a lot of subtext and symbolism in the film for the viewer to mull over (the Thai cop as God, the nature of revenge and atonement, Gosling's weird sexual hang-ups and oedipus complex). I guess I just disagree with your point that 'it didn't have a story deserving of the time it took to tell it' because I thought there was a lot of interesting stuff going on, and the film was only 90 minutes long which is really pretty brief.  Fantastic cinematography also counteracts the pacing, because there's always something to look at. The neon palette gives the whole thing a dreamy or otherworldly kind of feel which I think is effective given how the plot seems to take place in what Refn called a 'heightened reality' (it's like a fairy-tale or fable). This is probably a big part of why I liked the film and I don't think it would be half as good without it.  It's not a perfect film, Refn kind of went off into the deep end and maybe took it a little bit too far. Perhaps it would have a wider appeal if he dialed back the 'arthouse' elements a bit and executed it more as a traditional crime thriller / drama with some interesting subtext, but then it really wouldn't be the same film at all.  Overall I though it was okay and I'd give it maybe a 6.8/10. Doesn't quite hit the mark in some respects, but Refn is clearly to pushing to create something unique and interesting so I think he deserves some credit for that. Hard to rate this film because although I agree with a lot of the negative criticism of the film, I still really enjoyed it and it's one of my favourites from the year."
TrueFilm,39y859,wmille15,26,Tue Jun 16 04:46:45 2015 UTC,"Not Another Teen Movie (dir. Joel Gallen, 2001)  The Good: 1. A terrific cast. Every person is just a delight to watch. 2. Getting all the shots, cuts, and music cues right for the material parodied, such that the movie not only pokes fun at the way those movies were made, but pulls it off just as well as them.  The Bad: 1. The exhaustion this kind of joke-per-second parody induces. 2. That despite its best intentions, it's still another teen movie.  If I were any good at it, I would add non sequiturs to relieve the direct parodies, and try to make it something more than the genre it pulls apart. Maybe cross it with another genre? I think of the way 21 Jump Street fuses teen movie with buddy cop, or Hot Fuzz which just takes a type of crime thriller to a different setting."

The universe they created was pretty cool, the ideas behind how everything worked were pretty cool.  The CGI:  It was impressively beautiful.  What they did with Jupiter was really cool, and the action sequences were pretty good.  The Bad:  The Acting.  My god, the acting was awful, especially considering the cast they had.  And that brings us to Casting:  While they had a cast with some familiar faces and talented people in it, my god did they have no chemistry at all.  The two leads were poorly cast, and even the side characters were not appropriate for the people they were playing.  Their interactions were not meant to be, and perhaps this is what set off all the bad acting.  The dialogue was delivered stiffly, and nothing felt natural or meant to be."

(If its a movie about classes, you could literally show how the lower class produced a stronger person from the same gene set, and that would have actually been a unique film, it doesn't have to go that direction, but it could at least give the movie more direction)"

TrueFilm,39y859,Underplayed-Cliche,6,Tue Jun 16 04:21:21 2015 UTC,"Sleeping Beauty, 2011. This was a movie that I kept hearing about on the global radar for some time, but it's imminent release was just about all I heard. It kind of came and went and I wondered why, so it peaked my interest. When I saw it, I must say that it wasn't exactly what I expected, but I often find myself loving films for those reasons.     The Good:   It doesn't necessarily present a chilling atmosphere, but it accentuates a droning layer for the audience, which I noticed made me feel like a voyeur--a nonthreatening stalker following her descent into this underground odd-job of a sex-industry-without-sex. It preys to the appeal of being so close yet so far away. I never thought I would be aroused by the the thought of sleeping next to an attractive girl with the one and only rule of not being able to touch them. The idea itself feels underdeveloped at times but it teases me enough to keep my attention.    I can't remember the character's name, but there is a monologue scene by one of the older customers that was just the sweetest icing on top of this cake. It was worth it to watch the movie for that very compelling and reminiscent story that put a layered perspective on the film.   The Bad:   The unexplained subplot of the ""Birdman"".  It is all pretty much done in exposition dialogue and assumptions made by those actions in the film. Was it completely necessary? Maybe for the Lucy character, but for a viewer it only does so much. it left me going, ""Did this matter?"" For a promiscuous woman to have that one platonic friend may give sway to her provocative nature, but it runs cold and doesn't (I feel) finish what it sets out to do. Not horrible, not good, just there, but interesting.  The pacing is slow, but not foreboding or eerie, which I would anticipate for a shady--and otherwise specific--world of particular tastes.This is coming from a guy that rather enjoys slower paced movies, but there just isn't enough to look at or listen to warrant repeated viewing. The lack of characterization in the people that run the establishment just makes them two-dimensional investor characters in a unorthodox practice. I mean, How did this whole thing start? Who had the idea of such a service. I can presume all I want, but I see missed opportunities there.   IMDb rating: 5.3     My rating: 6.5 to 7"
TrueFilm,39y859,lordhadri,9,Tue Jun 16 03:03:55 2015 UTC,"Seventh Son Sergey Bodrov, 2014. Rating: 5.5  Good:    The look of the movie is sub-Lord of the Rings but nevertheless is a lot better than the usual 3D CGI crapfest genre movie these days: the creature designs are memorable, the images are bright unless we're in a place that's supposed to be dark, and there's some pretty real photography.  It'll sound weird to praise this movie's writing but this movie doesn't impale itself on exposition, instead it pretty much starts the main action right away. It feels awkward, but it's better than a ten minute prologue that fantasy genre movies usually have, and don't usually do for the right reasons. Also, unlike most superhero movies, this one has properly motivated conflict between the protagonists and antagonists in which the 'bad guys' are fighting back against oppression, so that the main arc of the story is for one of the 'good guys' to realize that this is his fault. I think I just like it because it's willing to sympathize with its villains, be critical of its protagonists, and overall avoid most of the dumb fads in blockbuster writing of recent years, such as using the fate of the planet as the only thing at stake in the fighting.    Bad:   Fire Jeff Bridges. Ben Barnes as the romantic hero is fine but a true movie star would have worked better. In the strictly technical sense, the action could have been better.   How would I improve this movie? The problem with genre movies like this is that it's hard to imagine how they'd be different if they were more ambitious. Sometimes what happens is that you get one like The Black Death that is so serious it isn't really any fun and therefore isn't automatically a better kind of movie. Not everything can be a genuine epic like Lord of the Rings, so instead I'd point toward Conan the Barbarian as the best inspiration: stop trying to make just another potboiler genre movie, but take what's good about the novel it's based on and try to tell a story that will feel really special and iconic to genre fans. That way they become fans of your movie, not just fans of the genre."

TrueFilm,39y859,Zobrem,4,Tue Jun 16 18:55:07 2015 UTC,"Mystery Men 1999  IMDB score: 6.0  ""A group of inept amateur superheroes must try to save the day when a supervillian threatens to destroy a major superhero and the city."" (from IMDB)    This movie is a pretty basic comedy that parodies superheroes.  As a kid I remember going to blockbuster and wanting to rent this movie but there was always something else, whether another movie or game that I always got instead. Eventually they stopped carrying it or at least I couldn’t find it. Fast forward a few years to 2005 and I’m in a small town grocery/liquor/hardware/movie rental store while on vacation and lo and behold they have a copy of Mystery Men. They were getting rid of all their VHS tapes as DVD was now king and I got it for $3 along with 4 other tapes that I was pretty much forced to take. It was the last tape I ever bought.    Good   The Cast-  Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria, William H. Macy, Janeane Garofalo, Paul Reubens, Greg Kinnear, Kel Mitchell, Wes Studi, Geoffery Rush, Eddie Izzard, and don't forget Tom Waits Almost all the characters are played by well known actors and/or comedians and for the most part they give great performances. The set, costumes, and props are pretty neat and give off this goofy cartoony yet dark vibe. Bonus Point: Dane Cook has an extremely small part and it’s good   Bad   The writing in this movie was 50/50 They have some great one-liners and dialogue such as in the diner scene when they are arguing about whether or not Captain Amazing is the same person as Lance Hunt (superman/clark kent) but then there are others that just fall flat. The pacing felt slow at times and the movie was a little too long (2 hours)   The movie could have been improved if they just shortened it up and got a different writer, maybe cut the love interest subplot for Ben Stiller’s character. I don’t know if I’d say this movie is underrated but it’s definitely underwatched. 1999 was such a great year for movies that I think this just fell by the wayside. Another interesting thing about this is that at the time super hero movies weren’t that big at least not compared to today. I think if they made this now it could be a pretty popular, unless of course one of those awful parody studio/directors got a hold of the rights."

Captain Amazing is obviously Batman with a little Superman and a lot of arrogance, the bit with all his endorsements reminded me of when Batman pulls out a credit card in Batman & Robin.  The colours/set designs are very similar to Schumacher's Gotham and the scene in the old folks home at the beginning was reminiscent of the charity ball that Poison Ivy interrupts in Batman & Robin.     Batman was really the only superhero around at the time so I imagine the latest Batman movie would have been a source of inspiration for Mystery Men on some level, it has been a while since I've seen either though so I don't have a really in-depth analysis for you."

TrueFilm,39y859,ServiceMerch,4,Tue Jun 16 18:19:15 2015 UTC,"Freddy Got Fingered. It's one of my all-time favorite films - it's where my flair quote comes from - and I think it gets a lot of flack for being the absolute cesspool of comedy. I don't see it as a bad gross-out comedy, but as Tom Green going apeshit all over Hollywood and making fun of what he saw fit with childish abandon. But as with all films, it has its faults.  Good things:   Tom's mission statement. Gross-out rom-coms needed to be taken down and mocked in front of the whole world for quite some time. I'm going to say this to you: I think the Farrelly Brothers are horrible filmmakers. They didn't appeal to me when I  was a kid and they don't appeal to me now. Tom's film not only shows what's wrong with the type of film Bobby and Peter churn out on the regular - they expect that a ton of gross-out gags with a morally-unsympathetic protagonist can suddenly be given a heart with a melodramatic B-story concerning his family and a hot girlfriend - but does it a lot better. The soundtrack, save for ""The Real Slim Shady"" cue at the end. It helped me discover quite a few bands - i.e. New York Dolls, Sex Pistols. Its humor. Tom's humor is more along the lines of a cruder Candid Camera as opposed to the general ""look at me, I'm fucking stupid as fuck"" gags found in other teri-bad comedies (i.e. Biodome). His jokes work not only as deconstruction, but get funny if you realize that his movie is the film equivalent of an Encyclopedia Dramatica page, albeit watered down. The really big shock-jokes (the baby being swung on the umbilical cord, Tom's friend breaking his leg while trying to ride the finished ramp, anything regarding the kid getting injured) are played quite disturbingly, showing how utterly out of reality Gord is and how we shouldn't like him. It's pretty clear-cut that we shouldn't root for this guy. It works really well if you're into anti-comedy. How clever the ending is. It wraps up way too nicely and yet it's so self-aware of itself, as if the film decided to end itself with everybody making amends because it was tired of presenting this crazy family's life. Rip Torn. That's all I have to say. How quotable the film is. I still like to quote this film at the most inopportune moments. It's so fun.   The bad:   The pacing. Holy fuck, this is a problem. Tom's first directorial feature and he doesn't know how to make a fast film. You can tell that he had to edit this down just to avoid an NC-17 - that there were crazier scenes and plot explanations that suddenly come out of nowhere. The film's pacing is all over the place, speeding up during big gag scenes and slowing down during conversations (especially between Jim and Gord, which go on forever). The mean-spiritedness of the film. Now, while this can work for people like me who just don't get the Farrelly Brothers, this won't appeal to their fans or to anybody coming in, expecting Tom Green to have made a film like his role in Road Trip: crazy, but safe. Tom's jokes are always aimed at some specific trope in Hollywood and you can tell he hates it The way Tom's gone about defending the film, especially since the film's 10th anniversary. He does seem to be a bit embarrassed by this film and tries to pass it off as this hyper-symbolic comedy, but I see it more as a Tom Green Makes Fun of Gross-Out Humor instead of the Un chien andalou of comedy. Some of the weirdness is part of that ""lol random"" crap people don't like on the Internet. The scenes in the cheese factory weren't so funny save for Tom doing a simple ""big dick"" joke."

It is generally percieved as a failure and though it has it's followers, I think taking the basic concepts and structure and being more consistent in tone could raise it to an classic level  The Good:   The concept is simple and brilliant. Kids build a spaceship that works. They are contacted in their dreams with the basics but must bond together and overcome obsticles to build a craft then take off to the stars where they find that they were sent the information by alien children who are disobaying their own parents. The testing of the ship, and equipment (Iron Man like) and adapting/building as they go.  The sense of wonder that would be how the one boy was first contacted (Ethan Hawke in the original) The brilliant score.   The Bad   Basically the whole 3rd act, which basically devolved into a goofy musical with puppets and jokes. Even the characters were a bit disapointed. Even before that there was some goffiness when they go toa  drive in and the characters in the movie are reacting to what is happening as their ship flys by. They are tonal issues but the idea of alien children disobeying their parents remains a good parrallel to our hero. Also the sort of 2001 dream sequence was silly. The only dream sequence should be at the end when they get a new message.   As I said at the start, it could be a brilliant movie that realizes the dreams of so many kids. To find a way to make the ending more ""serious"" with aliens that truley deliver wonder would just be brilliant. Also I would include more exploring before they are pulled off to the aliens. Have some time where they go to the bottom of the ocean to see giant squids, to the moon, even another planet before being taken out to another solar system. Really make them explorers before they enter the alien ship. I would also keep the tilt-a-whirl as the basic frame of their ship. :-)  Ethan Hawke could play the cop who is tracking them down."

The storyline was really loose, and it did a great job of setting up new comedic situations.  Bad    1. With its fantastic unique brand of humor, you really noticed when a joke wasn't good, and was inserted just to get some more mainstream humor in it, which just didn't fit in with the rest of the film.    2.

TrueFilm,39y859,ThrowingChicken,2,Wed Jun 17 13:56:06 2015 UTC,"The Zero Theorem counts as a 6.1. I rated it a 7 but I understand why this movie is so divisive. An isolated computer scientist from some strange reality tries to find the meaning of life through a computer while also waiting for a phone ""call.""  The Good  1) It has a likeable protagonist and portrays him as sympathetic while a little flawed and anti-social.  2) The plot is relatively simple if you ignore the science (which you should since the science is non-sense.)  3) The visuals are great. I found the opening very promising.  The Bad  1) This movie gets some bad rep for being pretentious and I agree somewhat. The director creates this nonsensical world all to deliver a simple existentialist message that has been repeated again and again (wow maybe death is better).  2) It's not a fun movie to watch. I had a headache just watching it.  3) The world building is a mess. The world made no sense and was operating on weird with little to no explanation. It tries so hard to put in so much unecessary information while explaining so little about the world.  4) The story has been recycled. Existentialism is an overused philosophy that's popular for high schoolers to toy with while smoking weed. The movie aimed for nihilism and sacrificed its entertainment factor. It lost both the critics and the mainstream masses with its themes.  5) Most of all, I felt detached from the world. It's important for the movie to be grounded in reality. If you're taken away from the movie, then you have no reason to care about it or its characters. Part of the charm of Alien, for example, is that the main characters are basically Truckers in space. You can understand the situation they're in and relate to them. This world tries so hard to be this high sci-fi concept that it ends up alienating everyone else.

TrueFilm,39y859,niktemadur,2,Thu Jun 18 06:37:11 2015 UTC,"I struggled to find a movie I watched with a sub-6.0 rating, but realised I watched one just recently, so here goes:   A Bigger Splash (1973, Jack Hazan) - 5.6 on IMDb  I watched it since Scorsese cited its camera work as an inspiration for Taxi Driver. It's a documentary about the British painter David Hockney, who is most famous for his pop-art paintings. The documentary loosely follows a narrative about Hockney's breakup with his boyfriend, who's a painter / model as well.  The Good   The basic ideas sound like they would make a very interesting, but also very unique documentary. First, we have Hockney himself. There's an opportunity to explore him as a character. Then we have his art - it's an opportunity to see his working process. Throughout the film, a few of Hockney's paintings are reconstructed as dream-like scenes, as if the painting was capturing a real moment. These are the most well executed scenes from the film. (though how staged they are makes the ""documentary"" label no longer applicable) The camera work was quite good - not that Scorsese is claiming that this is a forgotten masterpiece (upon further research I found out that Scorsese was inspired by a select few establishing shots), but unlike many other documentaries, the camera movement is very deliberate - there are a few sweet dolly and tracking shots, moving closer / further away from the subjects. One particularly memorable shot starts on an art dealer and dollies off to the side to reveal that he's sitting in a room that's full of boxes; he shut down his gallery. Even when the camera was handheld and following people around in New York, the shots were very engaging.    The Bad  Sadly it seems like the good premise turns into a bad film due to poor execution. There is almost no effort whatsoever to explore Hockney as a person. Maybe Hockney is just terribly boring... but most of the conversations that we hear in the film between Hockney and his friends are about Hockney contemplating a move to New York. A few conversations are about Hockney's low output of work. All the different elements of the film are a huge mess when put together. Apart from Hockney's conversations, we see him attend some mock-Miss Universe party where the winning contestant is a crossdresser. Out of nowhere comes an uncomfortable gay scene (uncomfortable in its awkwardness - two men are laying on top of each other and alternate between what looks like kissing and nibbling on each others' faces / necks), Hockney telling an anecdote about his tonedeaf father to a bearded man who's taking a bath while we see his neglected boyfriend in bed. A tiny bit is revealed about how he paints, but it's all so vague - ""So and so lent us their villa in France so we could take pictures by the pool"". The only specific thing we find out is that they project the photographs on a screen then trace them, then somehow transfer the outline to a canvas and colour it in. There doesn't seem to be a clear difference in terms of how all these thematically distinct scenes are shot / edited. It just goes from one to the next and you can't really tell where you are.   I wouldn't be so annoyed with the content of the film if it was a true documentary. Then I could easily conclude that Hockney and his friends are all boring and pretentious. The camera work, and several scenes (like Hockney ringing his friend's door bell, her not coming to answer, then we see that she's actually in her living room with Hockney's ex boyfriend) so clearly being staged, it begs the question: When you were staging the scenes, couldn't you have prompted their conversations to be a bit more interesting, or you could just give them scripts? By going back and forth so much between what looks like a documentary and what very clearly isn't a documentary, the appeal is quickly lost as whatever is shown on the screen isn't even certainly true any more. So if Hockney is indeed boring, someone who is interested in Hockney as a person could watch this documentary if it was a true to life, fly on the wall type of documentary. Even if Hockney is boring, the exploration of his boring character itself may be interesting to someone who admires his work. But if you're gonna lose the truthful depiction of events from your documentary, then what's left has to hold up on its own."
TrueFilm,39y859,HeadlessMarvin,2,Wed Jun 17 21:34:36 2015 UTC,"After scrolling through 3000 titles, my mind became saturated and could not continue a productive search.  However, I did find a misunderstood Robert Altman film that I am passionate enough about to defend here, Prêt-à-Porter.  Prêt-à-Porter, (1994, Robert Altman) - 5.0 on IMDb  It has all the great trademarks of an Altman film - a cast of thousands, the editing room wizardry of interweaving so many parallel stories, the organic texture of conversations intermingling with the background sounds, the extraordinary cinematography, etc. So why does it keep company with Tyler Perry's ""Madea"" films, Plan 9 From Outer Space and the backwash from the Fast/Furious franchise?  Even when it came out in 1994, back in my college days, it felt sort of like a Rorschach Test, measuring the pretentiousness of viewers. ""What a shallow film"" was the common complaint I heard, because and only because Prêt-à-Porter revolves around the fashion industry.  Such a repugnant topic!  Also, I must be misguided and/or shallow for liking the film!  The story goes that Altman was dragged (kicking and screaming almost) by his wife to a Paris fashion week, on the one hand filled with the same prejudices as many ""critics"" of this film, on the other expecting to be bored out of his mind.  To his great surprise, Altman was dazzled by the grandiose absurdity of the events and atmosphere and characters involved, here was an over-the-top circus stuffed with money and self-importance, ripe for a long overdue cinematic parody.  Everything revolves around clothes in Prêt-à-Porter.  A line that has stayed with me for decades is when a Paris police detective investigates a possible murder, an African gentleman ID's the suspect but admits that ""All white men look alike to me"" - ""Then how can you recognize any white man, particularly our suspect?"" - ""By the clothes, sir"".  Brilliant, perfect.  Every aspect of the signature Altman style, stated above, are my likes of Prêt-à-Porter.  As for the two dislikes: 1. The Julia Roberts-Tim Robbins screwball comedy/romance subplot, two abrasively stereotypical American characters stuck in a hotel room, taking us away from the fashion circus and slowing the film down. 2. The Terri Garr-Danny Aiello subplot was charming and with a great twist ending, but wasn't profiled too deeply, I wish we could have seen more of this wonderful, quirky couple with a secret.  (so this is not much of a dislike, really)  To sum up, Prêt-à-Porter may not be one of Altman's major works, but it's great fun and deserves more love than it gets.  EDIT:  Forgot to put the stuff in bold - name, year, director, IMDb rating"
TrueFilm,39y859,seanziewonzie,2,Fri Jun 19 09:23:27 2015 UTC,"Batman Forever  Good 1. I really like the art design. I know, I know, everyone hates how ""gay"" it is, but it's really inspired and very different from the typical brown and grey look a lot of movies have nowadays. It does a good job of balancing between nostalgia for the old goofy Batman and the mystique of the darker new Batman.   I liked the camera-work for the action scenes. It felt very stylized, and unlike a lot of the shaky-cam work we get in more recent movies, you could tell what the hell was going on.   Bad   The most obvious problem with the movie: the script. It's surface-level filler to pad out a Batman sequel and nothing else. The dialogue is unintentionally cheesy, the themes are blunt, and there's no depth.  I guess I have to go with Val Kilmer's performance. He seemed bored throughout and didn't really mesh well with the over-the-top performances from his villains. He needed some of the flair that Adam West or Michael Keaton had."
TrueFilm,39y859,SituationSix,2,Fri Jun 19 16:45:38 2015 UTC,"I'll do the recent 50 Shades of Gray movie. The IMDb rating is 4.2/10. My personal rating... I'd say 5/10.  The good:   Dakota Johnson is just a treat. An absolute delight. She and the director obviously knew what kind of movie they were making, and crafted the perfect tone for the character. In the same way that Scream was a horror movie starring culturally-aware people who can recognize elements of horror films,  this film had a main character who seemed subtly aware of the type of story she was entering into. This makes for some extremely entertaining moments, such as the scene where the contract is finally drawn up. Johnson and the director know that viewers don't like dumb characters, and they found the perfect way to reconcile that. Great job. I've read a bit of the original novel. I don't remember the name of the author, but I can tell you one thing about her: she ain't Steinbeck. She has the most ridiculous and intrusive way of handling imagery in her books. The prose is clunky and the figurative language goes overboard. A movie has the luxury of doing away with this, which is already a bonus, but the director takes it a step further and crafts some visually crisp shots. I was very impressed with her eye throughout the movie. Some scenes that come to mind are the piano-at- night scene (looking way better and more interesting than the other similar scenes I've seen in films), and the airplane hangar scenes.    I mean, she's not Campion yet, but thumbs up.  The bad:   The terrible last act. The tone shifts, previously established personalities and motivations are suddenly glazed over to suddenly give the couple an issue to fight about. This happens in a million romance stories, but this one is especially heinous in that it comes out of nowhere and, to be honest, I still don't fully understand what exactly was the issue. I felt like I had accidentally stopped paying attention to the movie for 5 minutes. But I didn't. Something there was very mishandled. How would I change it? Uh, not mishandle it I guess. Something about the editing or the script was extremely vague and sudden, and I, as a filmmaker, would make sure to ease my audience into accepting that plot point, and making what was occurring more explicit. All the set up with no pay-off. I get it. There's going to be sequels. But it feels very unsatisfying that elements of a characters past are brought up, and then left alone. The mother is the perfect example of this. She is introduced a few times, conflict seems just at the edge of occuring, and then the credits role. I say either leave the mother out of the movie and keep her for a relevant sequel, or use her for characterization purposes only, not drama and conflict."
TrueFilm,39y859,crichmond77,4,Wed Jun 17 16:37:31 2015 UTC,"Escape from Tomorrow    The Good 1. The guerrilla style footage is a brilliant idea    The Bad 1. The acting. Oh god, the acting. 2. The plot itself.   Escape from Tomorrow had the potential to become such a wonderful movie. So much effort went into making it, to the point where certain scenes were planned months in advance so the sunlight would be perfect. It's such a brilliant idea, secretly filming a movie within the most popular parks in the world, but is completely ruined by its lack of direction and poor acting.    The plot itself flip flops so much without any sense of direction that viewers don't really understand what's going on. The only indication of any ""cat flu"" is a brief sign and a crying nurse. Other than that it isn't even mention. It focuses more on the father following around two underage girls and being with a woman with a fascination with princesses. The acting was mediocre and the CGI and obvious green screen scenes take away from the film.    I was really excited about this film when I first heard about it, but sat in disappointment after it was over. This is a film that could only be done once. Disney let the studio slide because it didn't make that much money and they didn't want to look like the bad guys in court. They'll never let anything be shot there again. It really was a once in a lifetime film, so it's incredibly sad that it was a gigantic flop.   Edit: Grammatical errors"

Lots of interesting stuff that I could applaud, but just as many huge flaws that prevent me from calling it ""good."" But I'd rather a movie try something monumentally different and somewhat fail than do an OK job at something recycled and uninteresting."
TrueFilm,39y859,afewthoughtsonfilm,3,Mon Jun 15 21:52:13 2015 UTC,I think I like this movie more than some because I had just been to Disneyland and it was incredible just to think that they had done so much work to sneak their cameras in and film it all. I definitely felt like it should've been more focused but just the fact that something like this exists is cool to me.
TrueFilm,39y859,celtic1888,2,Tue Jun 16 13:08:59 2015 UTC,"Although I have to agree with the acting, as it is generally dreadful, I thoroughly disagree with your qualms with the plot.  I think on a first viewing, it can be hard to discern everything that is going on but upon revisits, the film comes together in really rewarding ways (an attribute that honestly goes to show the precision with which the director weaves his story together).  People, myself included, seemed to believe this was going to be more of a horror film, when in reality, the director chose to explore some of the psycho-sexual undertones of the Disney brand in general, something I didn't expect but found rather insightful.  In regards to the lack of attention placed on the ""cat flu"", I think this is a deliberate choice made on the part of the director.  Disney is notorious for doing everything they can to preserve their image; it's their #1 priority.  Moore chooses to name his mysterious flu the cat flu very deliberately, as the flu is the greatest threat to the park's image in the same way a cat is a mouse's greatest predator.  We don't get a lot of information about it beforehand because, as we see in the end, Disney works tirelessly to preserve their image, disposing of the Dad's body before any news could get around surrounding his death.  It may seem to come out of left field on a first viewing, but is really cleverly done.  Honestly, I adore this film quite a bit, despite its flaws.  It's an interesting dissection of the culture surrounding Disney, of the obvious sexual repression and darkness surrounding the company and the park itself.  Again, I think with the expectation that it will be more of a horror film, as it was billed, the film is disappointing.  However, taking it for what it is, I think it's really quite exceptional."
TrueFilm,39y859,dodli,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:55:38 2015 UTC,I went in with fairly low expectations but came away pretty happy with it.  It felt surreal enough to me that the plot line jumps actually made sense in context. There were certainly subtle clues about the 'cat flu' being spread with the visuals of random park patrons coughing in scenes and the wife showing disgust on her face at their apparent lack of manners. The nurse scene all but confirms there is something going on in the park and they are trying to keep it under-wraps. Last winter's measles out break at Disneyland was an interesting truth imitating fiction turn on the story.  There were obviously production problems and continuity issues with the guerrilla style of the movie. I was able to overlook them because the film was able to capture that weird feeling of an extended family trip to Disneyworld where you are immersed in everything Disney 24/7 to the point that normal reality starts to fade away.  Given more of a budget and better access to actors and locations would it be a better movie? Maybe but we certainly would see a lot of sacrifice in the story. No way a studio exec green lights it with the ephebophilia
TrueFilm,39y859,Splagodiablo,2,Mon Jun 15 21:55:31 2015 UTC,"Pete 'n' Tillie (1972)  The Good     Script: It manages to achieve a happy balance of wit, tragedy, philosophical musings and character study. And it rings very authentic to me. It is also very well structured; almost a textbook case study of a structured script. Acting: Superb performances from all: Matthau, Burnett and Page.   The Bad    It's one of my favorite movies of all time. I don't think there is anything wrong in this movie, so I'll say what bad things I think the IMDB people who gave this movie a low rating saw in it.  I think this movie suffered the same misfortune as ""Into The Woods"":   The movie straddles genres: it combines comedy with tragedy, and many people don't like this ambiguity. People went in expecting a comedy, and they got a melodrama instead. (With ""Into the Woods"" they were expecting a light hearted Disney fairytale musical and they got a biting drama.) Similar to the first point, people had a certain typecast in mind for Matthau and especially Burnett (a farcical comedienne), and they were disappointed or even shocked to see her playing a dramatic role. Somewhat like when you expect to eat a chocolate mouse and you get a lemon meringue instead. No matter how exquisite the meringue, if you were expecting chocolate, the lemon will taste bad."

TrueFilm,39sy21,afewthoughtsonfilm,16,Sun Jun 14 13:39:40 2015 UTC,"The Friends of Eddie Coyle Directed by Peter Yates (1973)- Always heard this film was dour so I hadn’t suspected there’d be so much suspense. The ever excellent Robert Mitchum stars as Eddie Coyle, an ageing criminal who’s trying to do whatever he can to not get jailed for the next two years. People keep telling him two years isn’t that bad but he doesn’t want his kids finding out what he has been and for them to be treated differently ‘cause their pops is in the big house. So he’s kind of doing it all for pride. He likes the way he’s seen and doesn’t want that changed, we see how in the crime world he’s even more adamant about who he is being understood. But he wants to be understood as the criminal tough guy and the loving father, but the film shows that they only way of leading these kind of double lives is by not even trying to be honourable but by doing whatever is best for you and you alone. In-between Coyle setting up jobs and figuring out what to do we get several gripping heist scenes (with some of the best heist masks ever), a night time showdown, and a brilliantly tight and scrappy car chase. Most of what I’d heard about this film was it being classic 70s crime grimness but people seem to miss when recommending it how action-packed it can feel, how intense it gets, and how well shot these sequences are. Man does Mitchum fit the 70s as much as he did the 50s. He carries a dignity and sense of honour that has completely disappeared from the world he’s in. Criminals and lawmen blur, everyone’s just out for their own. A great film for the reasons I’d heard then surprising on top of that.   F for Fake (Re-watch) Directed by Orson Welles (1973)- Welles was always a trickster and F for Fake has him indulging in it as much as possible. We get a fascinating documentary about art forgery and lies in general as well as Welles’ showmanship. How the film is edited seems to have set the standard for the contemporary essay film too. Even though this film can be seen in later works no one retains Welles’ playful spirit which goes hand in hand with the editing. Short yet stuffed. One of the best mixes of informative and fun, though Welles is far less interested in the reality than what the whole of it comes it.   The Grapes of Death Directed by Jean Rollins (1978)- John Steinbeck’s bloody less-known sequel to The Grapes of Wrath where Tom Joad finds himself in a zombie-related pickle. Well part of that is true at least. Rollins takes no time just getting into things. We see orchard workers with crummy masks spraying pesticides and coughing, cut to our main character on a train. Very quickly she finds herself running from an oozing faced zombie. She takes off into the French countryside desperate to reach her fiancés orchard while surviving this horrid plague. This was my first Rollins film (a guy whose name I’ve known of for ages) and apparently it’s not quite like his others which are more euro-horror-erotica type stuff from what I gather. Even though the effects and such are very much of the time (though great) the film itself feels ahead of its time. It knows what we already understand about zombies (even though these have a unique twist on them) and just gets into it things. Like Romero’s zombie films there’s a strong socio-political through line exploring the changes in the French identity and nationalism. For some folk this zombie plague is almost as if the war’s just starting off again, the resistance reinstated, like they’re in a perpetual state of readiness to fight back. Unlike Romero though Rollins has a bit of a better eye for beauty. Most of this comes from the amazing natural environments he’s shooting in but it’s also how he captures the quintessential Frenchness of the place, like all these horrors are invading classic countryside portraits. That isn’t completely the case though, the source of the horror is in the name of the film and its origins so completely French. Our protagonist is even clad in purple, a grape ready to be squashed by this world. Speaking of her it was great to see a horror protagonist who’s generally smart about things and able to handle themselves, even if things do take their psychological toll. Not as fun or gloriously grotesque as Romero’s film from the same year but an enjoyably distinct piece of the massive zombie sub genre.   While We’re Young Directed by Noah Baumbach (2014)- Baumbach’s been compared to Woody Allen for years but this is the Allen-iest I’ve ever seen him, yet his perspective and sensibilities differ enough that it doesn’t feel like a dull copycat. For a while I’ve been bummed about modern mainstream comedies because so few seem to be about anything. The Lego Movie has more to say than most modern comedies that are mainly just showcases for whatever actors are in them. Even something like Sullivan’s Travels that’s making the point that sometimes people just need a laugh it’s still making a point and doing it brilliantly. Basically I miss stuff (from eras I wasn’t even around for) like Broadcast News and Allen’s classics that are as funny as they are involving. While We’re Young is the closest I’ve seen Baumbach come to that. It’s constantly witty, constantly building on its characters and themes, and would be a pretty perfect comedy had the camera done a little more. Allen’s (at his best) always too in love with Bergman and New York to allow things to look dull, but Baumbach’s a bit more straightforward visually while leaning more on editing to spice it up. It’s not as flat and over lit as most big comedies but it’s closer than I’d like it to be. Sometimes films stuffed with references can feel a little obnoxious in a “you seem like you’re trying to win me over with things I already like” type way, but not here. To my pleasant surprise this is a film about filmmakers and filmmaking (documentary’s in particular) as it is about growing old and youth, so there’s plenty nods to things film folk love. I think I’d get a delight in a character in anything saying “What’s the rumpus” Miller’s Crossing style but here Baumbach doesn’t just plop stuff like that in but uses it to reflect the people saying it. Baumbach goes as far as to do a twist on a Crimes and Misdemeanors subplot and still manages to do his own thing. With Frances Ha and this he’s really made me more excited for him than I ever was. Allen barely matches his best even when he makes something better than usual these days but it seems like Baumbach’s picked up the pieces and moulded them to our new era. After Walter Mitty it was great to enjoy Ben Stiller again, he and everyone else are really great in this. Seeing Naomi Watts awkwardly dance to hip-hop in a snippet of the trailer had me a little concerned but even that manages to not be a rote old-folk-new-culture joke and become something genuinely touching. Loved a lot of this.   A Moment of Innocence Directed by Moshen Makhmalbaf (1996)- My introduction to Makhmalbaf was the similarly reality-twisting and meta Kiarostami film Close-Up that told another odd tale in the life of Makhmalbaf. In F for Fake Welles is quite explicit about what’s “real” and has a lot of fun with that and here Makhmalbaf has equal fun distorting the entire idea of reality. What is true is that Makhmalbaf stabbed a policeman as a teen during a protest and went to jail for a while. Years later he found the policeman to try make amends. This dramatised version has Makhmalbaf and the policeman working on a re-enactment of the stabbing. So the policeman helps choose an actor to play his younger self and then mentors the actor who gets the role. As he mentors his “younger self” Makhmalbaf does the same. These two men split off as do their stories which then converge in brilliant ways. Through the story it is funny, intriguing, and touching but it also packs in so much into that 80 minute runtime. At first that Moment of Innocence title might seem like a brush-off on Makhmalbaf’s part in regards to him having stabbed a guy but by the end it takes on a very different meaning. By the end it becomes a sad ode to how we interpret our own lives, how we mythologise our past, and our defining moments in life. Maybe I’ll need to see Close-up again but I found this as perceptive and even more enjoyable. Makhmalbaf’s so upfront about some of what he’s doing rather than obfuscating things a bit like Kiarostami yet he’s still able to pull the rug out from under us. Gotta have one of the best freeze-frame endings ever too. They’re always quite abrupt and sometimes the film isn’t using that jarring stop for any purpose beyond adding a “The End” to the whole thing and an image to have under credits. Here it captures what the film is, and what is is saying, while still leaving us with things to ponder. Another brilliant film about films (to an extent) this week and one of the best."
TrueFilm,39sy21,indiebass,9,Sun Jun 14 13:40:06 2015 UTC,"Casino Royale (Re-watch) Directed by Martin Campbell (2006)- Everyone seems to love this film so much and I was so won over by Skyfall that in retrospect I didn’t look on it as strongly as everyone else. On top of that some of the Skyfall backlash was so far from how I felt that I wondered if they were crazy and not me. Turns out no ones crazy ‘cause Casino Royale is pretty amazing. Everything is updated and fresh but still so Bond. The only place it isn’t really Bond is in how its shot which is a big step down from Skyfall that updated the luxurious nature of the classics to the modern age. Action is great, Eva Green is probably one of the best Bond girls, there’s actual ambiguity (something that’s basically not present in any other Bond flick), and it’s just straight cool. Stuff like Green and Mathis being poker-explainers gets a little silly and the locations do everything for the camera as it just looks at things but it’s on the whole really good. I think I still prefer Skyfall as it’s even truer in spirit to classic Bond (while still being thoroughly New-Bond) but Casino Royale’s closer to the books so it’s whatever your fancy I guess.   Cowards Bend the Knee Directed by Guy Maddin (2003)-  The more I watch of Guy Maddin’s films the more I see how much of a slap in the face it must’ve been for The Artist win Best Picture and be praised for bringing back silent filmmaking. The Artist is just a retread of things we’ve already seen in silents and beyond while Maddin has for years taking the techniques of the silent era to wild, daring, new places. Cowards Bend the Knee is a kaleidoscopic trip into a man’s subconscious as seen through what seems to be an uncovered damaged film from the 20s. Never seen a silent film with a hilarious fisting joke but that’s what you’ll get here (we get a shot of man bracing his fist for plunging, a woman bent over, then a shot of a fist hitting the inside of a trombone). The film is constantly shifting and the editing flies all around the place like Eisenstein freaking out. At times it can be almost tiring in its pace but it more than makes up for it with the imagination and depth of its whole. We jump from wax hockey legends to ghostly exes to a murderous hand transplant and so on yet it all creates such a cohesive picture. More hand symbolism than Only God Forgives and as much psycho-sexual strangeness as a David Lynch film with Maddin’s particular whimsical personality injected in.  Time After Time Directed by Nicholas Meyer (1979)- Malcolm McDowell as H.G. Wells chases down David Warner as Jack the Ripper through time. A killer premise rife for hilarity, coolness, or both, that I’ve had on my watch list for ages. Somehow though it manages to be dull. Well and Ripper end up in the 70s, lots of fish-out-of-water comedy, and many attempts at being progressive that’d cause outcry today. One joke in particular ended up being hilarious because of how insane it was to hear in the current climate. Wells ends up back at the apartment of Mary Steenburgen (both of whom ended up marrying after meeting on this film) and when they’re on the couch kissing, Steenburgen having pursued him all day, Wells says “I’m not pushing you am I?”. Or something to that effect. To which Steenburgen says “Push me? I’m practically raping you” cue big kiss and music. For something that has the feel of a 60s/70s live-action Disney film it has way more adult stuff in it. Any time it gets sordid it’s like whiplash compared to the lame humour of the rest, a reminder that oh-yeah Jack the Ripper did some horrible stuff. Warner and McDowell are two guys I usually love but even they couldn’t save this film. They didn’t even seem to know what type of film they’re in and the director what type of film he was making. They’re really acting their hearts out sometimes even though for the most part this is a romantic comedy or something. McDowell’s playing it straight but he’s not always written as the straight man so it all becomes stiff. Some moments of fun and “Oh the 70s” moments but more dull than anything."
TrueFilm,39sy21,lordhadri,6,Sun Jun 14 13:40:22 2015 UTC,"I absolutely adored A Moment of Innocence and I definitely agree with your comparisons to Close-Up.  Kiarostami is less willing to be openly self-reflexive (at least in that piece - that's definitely not the case in some of his others), but I liked how Makhmalbaf is able to be playful with how he presents what's real and what isn't.  Honestly, when you think about the implications of every scene in the film, it's hard to imagine a situation in which the whole thing isn't simply fiction.  Iran's doing some really interesting stuff with the medium, that's for sure."

TrueFilm,39sy21,pulpwoods,9,Mon Jun 15 01:41:57 2015 UTC,"In order of preference:    Fanny and Alexander (5 hour TV version) Ingmar Bergman, 1982.   This film is Bergmans magnum-opus and the finale of my dedicated year living on the same island he did. I watched the 188-minute cut last fall and I am pleased to say I was equally blown away by this semi-rewatch. The way he manoeuvres from reality into fantasy and/or super natural dimensions really gets me. I've always been able to identify naturally with Bergmans authorship and his narratives, but this film lifts the personal bond with me to a higher ground. The dichotomy between a fathers ""love"" and brutal punishments is hauntingly portrayed, and allows the audience to really feel and contemplate the love/discipline relationship . 5/5.     The New World Terrence Malick, 2005. (Rewatch)  Man, I fucking love Malick. This being his most speculative and contemplating film right after The Tree Of Life, I unceasingly love it. The long, resting nature shots coupled together with a rambling voice-over just does it for me. Instantaneous love, no questions asked. I read somewhere that a critic once said that Malick does not shoot in a literary or theatrical fashion; but in a cinematic fashion. There's no need for a complex plot or an epic character arc for the viewer to feel big emotions, and that is what Malick proves to you in his moviemaking. 5/5.    Ex Machina Alex Garland, 2015.   In spite of fearing that this film was just another over-hyped plastic sci-fi horror trip,  I did quite like this. Not only is it so very timely in its themes, but it also surprised me with some experimental and daring story telling. The way Garland tricks you into identifying with the different characters over time is a clear sign of his directorial (read manipulative) skills. I mean I was not only mind-fucked but I was defiantly lured into both loving Ava and at the same time also fearing her. The film finally left me with a hole in my stomach that could only be filled with a large glas of scotch. 4/5.     Antichrist Lars von Trier, 2009  Von Trier continues to imbue me with a loving sickness for his dark, ambiguous films. A few moments in this film stood out to me and continue to lurk in my mind, especially the scene were the gizzard-leaking fox informs you that ""chaos reigns"". I get shivers just thinking about it. Overall I am not super excited about the general impression of the film but then again I am never so by von Triers films. His genius, if he has one, lies for me in his capability to render some unique and powerful scenes, not in creating thoroughly cinematic experiences or masterpieces. Strong 3/5."

Fanny And Alexander   Are you talking about the dichotomy between the original father and the stepfather? Or between the stepfather's ""tender"" moments and his abuse? I'm hoping you mean the former, because there was absolutely no sincerity in the stepfather's ""love."" To me it was pretty clear that every nice word to come out of the guy's mouth was manipulation, control, and borderline sadism. Maybe we're on the same page here..."
TrueFilm,39sy21,E_Con211,2,Mon Jun 15 07:02:12 2015 UTC,"Actually I'm talking about the two-sided stepfather. Bergman himself based this character on his experiences as a child, with his dad being a man of the church. He describes the horror and total confusion when his father praised love but lived with harsh discipline. This is exactly what we see in the film; a father whose message of love and kindness is hard to take in when coupled with the unforgiving nature of his attitude towards you.   But yes, I do also agree with you that in the film the stepfathers words of love can be seen as means to control and manipulate."
TrueFilm,39sy21,abrightersummerday,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:20:36 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying. I just simply can't take the ""strict discipline"" method of child-rearing as having much of anything to do with love. I think the ""message of love and kindness"" is hard to take in because it's absolutely hypocritical and cynically dishonest. But I can also see how a child might believe in the innate goodness or rightness of the father figure (or of authority) and thus this kind of abuse breeds confusion. I agree that ""horror and confusion"" is the response of Alexander before he decides definitively that the stepfather is actually a monster.   I didn't notice in the initial post that you put ""love"" in quotes, and that makes a lot more sense to me."
TrueFilm,39sy21,E_Con211,9,Mon Jun 15 23:04:54 2015 UTC,"Roma, Federico Fellini, (1972): Roma sees Fellini looking back at his early life in his hometown of Rimini and his move to Rome when he was a young man. There are also scenes of Fellini making what seems to be a documentary about the modern Rome. In Roma, Fellini explores themes of history, memory, how the past relates to the present day and whether or not the past can survive these modern times. The flamboyance that Fellini is renowned for is abundant. The nostalgic look back at the 1930s-WW2 era Italy reminded me of Amarcord. These scenes, which are drawn from Fellini's personal experiences, present unremarkable yet bitter sweet moments of a time that was already long gone by the early 70s. There isn't really a linear plot and some scenes weren't as strong as others, but the stronger scenes were truly amazing. The scene of Fellini's documentary team shooting on a hellish modern highway on a rainy night was startlingly intense. The Religious fashion show was a Fellini masterclass in the its use of music, costume, set design and atmosphere. The motorbikes chaotically hurtling through modern Rome really did a great job at tying together everything Fellini was trying to convey throughout the film. 8/10  2 Days In Paris, Julie Delpy, (2007): A mid-30s couple spends 2 days in the woman's hometown of Paris after a holiday to Venice that did not go too well. Julie Delpy directed, produced, wrote, acted, edited and did the music for 2 Days In Paris. The result of this impressive effort is a really nice, surprisingly funny, romantic comedy. Delpy has a great sense of humour. She isn't afraid to be rude, immature or dark. Some plot-points were a little lacklustre, but overall I really enjoyed this film. It isn't just another rom-com. Its a really unique film that never feels like its trying to be different. Very enjoyable. 7/10  Exit Through The Gift Shop, Banksy, (2010): This Documentary is about a frenchmen named Thierry who is constantly filming his life. He gets involved in the street art scene and ultimately attempts to make a documentary showing all the amazing artists and art he has experienced. This isn't the documentary we are seeing though. Exit Through The Gift Shop is very surprising in the path it follows. Banksy made this documentary which turns the focus back onto the original documenter, Thierry. If you have even a fleeting interest in street art you'll really like this doco. It's really well edited and really takes an unexpected turn. A fascinating character study. 8/10  Stations Of The Cross, Dietrich Brüggemann, (2014): The Stations Of The Cross are 14 scenes that follow Jesus on the day he was crucified. The 14 scenes are used to tell the story of a 14-year-old girl who lives a very ascetic life and is part of an ultra-conservative Catholic society that rejects the modern papacy. There are only 14 shots in the film and the camera is usually stationary. Everything is framed really well and the acting is very good. Lea van Acken who plays the religiously devout girl puts in a marvellous performance that I'm surprised hasn't got a bit more attention. Questions of faith, miracles and the role of parents are explored in this film in a very measured and intelligent way. Powerful film-making. 8/10  The Color Of Pomegranates, Sergei Parajanov, (1969): I just watched this on youtube and I'm not sure what to say really. All I know is that I loved it. The film shows the life of 18th century Armenian poet Sayat-Nova. It's not a linear, conventional biopic though. The poet's life is portrayed in a poetic way. This is one of the most visually stunning films I've seen and is unlike anything else I've ever watched. It does a really great job at showing all of the most beautiful elements of Armenian culture. It's on youtube and is only about 70 minutes long so I recommend that anyone who hasn't seen this check it out when they can to understand just how hypnotic and unique this film is. Very special. 9/10"

TrueFilm,39sy21,Crusty_Baboon,9,Tue Jun 16 08:28:37 2015 UTC,"Jurassic World I actually just wrote a thing about this on my tumblr but it's really long so I didn't want to repost it in full here. Long story short though is that I hated it. It's a dreadful, boring, generic, horribly written mess that's going to make over a billion dollars. My initial reaction after seeing it was a 3/5 but the more I think about it the more I hate it. There are just so many basic lapses in writing and characterization. Almost from beginning to end the movie makes no sense and never makes any attempt to have a logical story or plot.  Mad Max: Fury Road I wrote two things about this if anybody feels like reading what basically amounts to a short essay about Fury Road. The short story here is that I adore this movie and it's already one of my favorite action movies ever. It's so economical and tightly written and it uses its action sequences to develop the characters and move the story forward rather than treating the them as narrativeless (that isn't a word but it is now) spectacle meant to punctuate long stretches of boring exposition. There isn't a forced romantic subplot (huzzah!) or much in the way of subplots at all. The whole movie is one extended chase sequence so the structure of the plot actually gives the film a lot of inherent forward momentum. It reminded me of Dredd in that sense, but Fury Road does it even better and has more interesting characters too. At this point I don't know if there's much that needs to be said about Fury Road. It's easily one of the best action movies of the last decade and I can't imagine a better one being released this year.  Kill Bill The Tarantino fanboy in me hates splitting Kill Bill up into two movies, the part of me that's actually critical of movies understands that there's a clear drop in quality from the first part to the second and that they should really be considered two distinct films. I've spent a lot of time thinking about exactly why I don't like the second part as much as the first and I think I finally figured it out. It's O-Ren Ishii. Like most of Tarantino's movies, both parts of Kill Bill are messy and unstructured but O-Ren provides the backbone for the first part and Tarantino actually spends a lot of time developing her character and explaining how she joined the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and then became head of the Tokyo underworld. You don't get that with anybody else in the movie. The first part also wears its influences more clearly and uses them in more interesting ways. Honestly, my thought for a long time has been that the first part of Kill Bill is the last really great film that Tarantino made. The second part is too long, too slow and lacks an interesting or well developed villain like O-Ren."
TrueFilm,39sy21,mealsharedotorg,7,Sun Jun 14 18:27:59 2015 UTC,"The reason I consider Vol. II better is because that's the real movie. Vol. 1 is just a bloody revenge genre movie, Vol. 2 is a much more sophisticated, human story. The reason it's long is that it develops every character in more interesting ways, including letting Bill transcend being a genre 'villain.'"
TrueFilm,39sy21,noCunts4me,3,Sun Jun 14 20:55:56 2015 UTC,"I thought Jurassic World was awful as well. I guess it shouldn't be a surprise, but I think I just expected better after seeing fury road last week (in terms of rebooting classics). I rarely can't wait for movies to end, and at times it actually kind of felt insulting to the viewer, like they weren't even trying to make sense (plus all the product placement, of course). Chris Pratt couldn't even save it for me, but I blame that entirely on the dialogue. And I know Nick Robinson has a lot more talent than what he was able to show, as does Kingpin, which was frustrating.   The only redeeming quality was Giacchino's excellent score."
TrueFilm,39sy21,Akumies,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:37:55 2015 UTC,"Do you think that Vol. 1 is better because Vol 2 exists? When I saw the first one in theaters, I appreciated it.  But immediately after seeing Vol 2 when it came out, suddenly Vol 1 improved, and not as a comparison between the two.  I felt that the second film gave the first one more flesh and blood to what was a skeletal look at the bride.  Sure, O-Ren had a fantastic backstory (also my favorite part of part 1), but part 2 made the rest of part 1 even better by giving it that context.  Your thought?"
TrueFilm,39sy21,TrumanB-12,6,Fri Jun 19 13:58:58 2015 UTC,"A really slow week because of an exam and OITNB, but i managed to squeeze in three films and Y Tu Mamá También was the film that stuck with me the most.      Y tu Mamá también (2001) Directed by Alfonso Cuarón  Fantastically captures youth sexuality in an honest genuine way without ever feeling gratuitous. Cuarón’s documentary style with lots of handheld and long uninterrupted takes makes the film feel more real and closer to the characters. The characters may not be very likable, but they are really interesting and well acted. The film has many funny and heartfelt moments and it is far from your average road trip movie. I really appreciate how Cuarón ends the film in a more memorable way instead of giving it an easier and safer happy ending.  9/10     Rope (1948) Directed by Alfred Hitchcock  Really feels like a play, most likely because it is based on one. The acting is good although some of the actors go a bit over the top. Hitchcock is once again a master at tension and it really feels like the film takes place in real-time. I really like the backdrop and how changes to emphasize the progression of time, it is obviously a matte painting, but when it comes alive so well it is easy to look past that. 8/10     Enemy (2013) Directed by Denis Villeneuve  The idea may not be the most unique, but the execution certainly is. The film has an uncomfortable vibe to it, especially because of the score. Gyllenhaal is great as always and it is interesting to see him act off himself. The pacing is great and 90 minutes is perfect for it although it ends a bit abruptly and weirdly. I might have to see the film once more to fully get it. 8/10"
TrueFilm,39sy21,Stack42,6,Sun Jun 14 16:10:58 2015 UTC,"United Passions dir. Frédéric Auburtin, 2014: One of the best comedies in recent memory - Tim Roth exquisitely portrays a depressed man slowly burning his own career into tatters, whilst Auburtin's use of archetypal stereotypes such as ""villainous englishman with heavy RP accent"" and ""proud frenchman with heart of gold"" harker back to the golden age of Ealing comedies of the early 1950s.  But really though, it was awful; but thankfully in a rare example of ""so unbelievably bad it's good"" way, and not ironically too. Redditor /u/Ragnar_OK sums up the film better than I ever could in this post."
TrueFilm,39sy21,Inception_025,5,Sun Jun 14 17:12:26 2015 UTC,"The Fountain  So i decided to revisit my favourite movie of all time and see if it holds up with my new grading schema. Oh boy it did. This sci-fi-romance-drama by Darren Aronofsky starrs Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz, the former of which plays 3 characters across 3 different time periods (1500s, 2005, 2500s) who all in their own way are trying to combat death from affecting their lives. In the 1500s, Conquistador Jackman is sent to Mexico to find the Tree of Life, in 2005 Doctor Jackman is trying to come to terms with his wife's cancer and in the 2500s we have him instead travelling in a biosphere in deep space together with the Tree of Life which he is desperately trying to save by getting to a distant star called Xibalba. I love non-linear narratives in movies and here its in full use. Sequences repeat and scenes transition on the middle of occurences. You can see a character from another time period suddenly interject on screen and then subsequently the movie will flip to their time period. Looking past the soulful perfomances by all the actors, we have a visually spectacular moives made with very little CGI. Instead Aronofsky commissioned the VFX to be created through microscopic reactions and processes. What it results in is a golden-black spectacle that is utterly unique in its presentation. Clint Mansell reprises his role as composer for this movie and devlivers his best work to date. Its very orchestral and epic, just like the movie itself despite a sub 2hr runtme. This is a movie with different interpretations and layers of meaning. Everyone can walk away with their own view on the occurences and themes. This is a pure masterwork of a film and it gets my highest score.  10/10  The Conjuring  Im a big fan of James Wan. Saw and the Insidious movies rank among my favourites in the horror genre and even Dead Silence was enjoyable despite its many hiccups. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga star as the real life wife-husband paranormal investigation team: The Warrens, in what i consider to be the most solid and consistent horror movie this decade. Its not perfect, but its very technicaly sound. The story is generic as all hell (spooky house) and its not exactly original at all, but i dont mind at all. The Conjuring is more than the sum of its parts because it holds together so well. I dont mind cliches in a movie which puts them together in a sound and enjoyable manner. For this reason i loved this movie. People will have trouble getting over the fact this is not a new idea, but this is The Haunting for a modern generation, nothing wrong with that. Putting aside the simple writing, this has alot to offer. Wan didnt take risks, but he didnt need to. His strength in the movie is how he coordinates his crew. The jumpscares are creepy and ALL of them are well deserved with plenty of tension flowing all through the movie. The score by Joseph Bishara is a prime factor, though i personally liked his work in Insidious better. One of the things i love about Wan is how he doesnt like to use CGI. We have plenty of practical effects, prosthetics and makeup utilised to full extent. Add that to patient and sharp camerawork that excells at showing exactly how much it needs to, and an absolutely gorgeous beige, grey, white aesthetic that gives this movie the 70s feel it deserves. I gasped at how beautiful some of the shots were. Im a tough scare, and just like i expected, this wasnt the scariest movie ive ever seen, but its consistently creepy (yes i even liked the last 3rd that so many critisize) and gave me some good jolts. Its too slow paced for some and probably not the saving grace of horror, but this deserves proper appreciation.  8.2  Shaun the Sheep: Movie  I love Aardman. I love the miniseries of the titular movie and Wallace&Gromit: The Curse of the Wererabbit might be my favourite animated movie of all time. Claymation is great. It made sense i had some expectations for this movie. Essentially Shaun and his crew have to bring their farmer back from the city after a small accident. The animations are as sleek as ever and i laughed consistently for the first 20 or so minutes of this movie. Unfortunately those subsided as the movie went on. There were heavy editing issues that plagued the movie. Sequences went on for far too long or far too short and the creators missed great opportunities to expand the movie. Jokes got old too quickly and there were about 2 or 3 montages that didnt fit at all. Even the storyline became muddled and stopped being compelling. I still had fun but this wasnt up to scratch.   7,1  Enter the Void  Gaspar Noe's Irreversible amazed me last week and this movie only made me gain even more respect for him. This passion project of his is probably the biggest budget and most ambitious arthouse movie i know of. It filled with alot of heart and im so sad it made 1.25% on its returns. Its essentially about a junkie in Tokyo who after dying early on in the movie, wanders through space and time and follows different people such as his sister who works as a stripper. Its non-linear and very surreal to say the least. The standout here are the VFX. Tonnes and tonnes of neon covered city scapes that glow with a hypnotising intensity. This is all captured by the insanely talented cinematographer Benoit Debie (Spring Breakers, Irreversible). He used long takes that reach and film from locations that seem almost impossible. All manners of techniques are used by him. POV, Over-the-shoulder, birdseye, dutch angle, rotating, and perhaps the most astonoshing, a ghost like free roaming mode that goes through walls and flies through transitions. Its a kaleidoscopic experience. Its literally Spring Breakers on LSD, MDMT and any other psychedelic substance you can think of. Its utterly captivating. This movie wouldve been near perfect if it wasnt for simplistic writing (not a main offender) and very mediocre acting (big offender). Noe hired essentially people off the street and while that worked with some characters, it wasnt worth it. Line delivery is flat and almost everyone lacks much substance. Characterisation is more through the stellar direction than the dialogue/acting. The performances are truly a huge let down. Luckily its not a character driven movie so it doesnt ruin the trippy atmosphere. Its a long and slow paced piece of work, but if youre up for something unique, check it out (being high/drunk atleast once while seeing it is worth it).  9,1"
TrueFilm,39sy21,All_Seven_Samurai,15,Sun Jun 14 23:31:31 2015 UTC,"I didn’t get to watch many new movies this week, but every movie I did watch was amazing.  The Treasure of the Sierra Madre: I’ve been meaning to watch this for a very long time. I’d always heard it was really good. I didn’t expect it to be as great as it was though. The acting and characters were all perfect. The story was wonderful. And I absolutely loved the ending , it was almost similar in some ways to a bleak Coen Brother’s movie ending. This may be one of my new favorite movies. 10/10  A side question: Would you classify The Treasure of the Sierra Madre as a Western? It has several themes of Westerns and the location setting fits but it takes place at least 20 years later than most Westerns. It has the overall feel of one so that’s what I would classify it as, (I usually count Jeremiah Johnson as one even though in some ways the setting and time period details don’t exactly fit) but I’m not sure.  Psycho (1960) (Rewatch): I haven’t watched this in about 4 or 5 years, and I’ve been watching the major Hitchcock movies I’ve never seen before the past few weeks, so I decided to watch it again now that I understand Hitchcock better. Of course it was great. I don’t think it’s his best, but from what I’ve seen of his so far I’d say it’s in my top 5 Hitchcock films. The cinematography was great, the acting was phenomenal, the story is simple but great. This time I noticed not just how great some characters dialog is, but their mannerisms also really make the characters. Anthony Perkins especially, the constantly eating the candy corn, (mostly when he’s nervous I noticed also) really adds a lot of substance to his character. 10/10  Rashomon: Wow this was a phenomenal film. This was my first Akira Kurosawa and Japanese film (outside of anime of course). It’s pretty funny because I had a selection of a few Akira Kurosawa movies. I ended up picking this one because it was the shortest actually. I saw it had a high IMDb rating but I knew nothing about it outside of that. So I was stunned by how great this actually was. The acting and cinematography was amazing, every scene in the flashbacks in the woods was filmed perfectly, and all the characters were great, and the story was phenomenal. 9.5/10 What Kurosawa films would people recommend I watch next?  Princess Mononoke: I’ve watched quite a few Miyazaki movies before, Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle, My Neighbor Totoro, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and few more, but I’d actually never had an opportunity to watch this before. I’d often heard people say it’s his best and I can see why, it was really amazing. Spirited Away has always been special to me, and may be my favorite animated movie of all time, so I doubt it will replace it for me. But either way this was an amazing film. I really enjoyed the more mature content compared to the other films I’ve seen of his. The story was absolutely wonderful and all the characters were great. The animation was wonderful of course. All in all a wonderful film. 9.5/10  12 Angry Men (1957): I’ve been put off watching this forever, and I don’t know why. I’m really glad I finally did. Of course all the characters and acting were wonderful and very fleshed out, you get a great sense of each characters personality, how they fell about the case, and why they feel that way. It really is amazing. The cinematography was great, and it made me really feel like I was locked in the room with them all. Wonderful film. 9/10  Schindler’s List: So I finally watched this too. It was great film, with a great story, and great message about the Holocaust. It was very important, like I’ve heard so many people tell me before. While it was great, it actually may be the movie I watched this week that I have the most complaints about. The cinematography and acting and story were all amazing. I really loved the movie, and it really did live up to the greatness I’ve heard about it, but I feel some things could have been done better and I’m going to be critical about them. I think the film maybe could have been better if had actually been done in German and Polish rather than it mostly being English; though as counterpoint this would have robbed us of Ralph Fiennes amazing performance as Amon Goeth. Another thing that bothered me was the symbolism, especially with the little girl in the red coat. I understand symbolism is important in films like this, and the little girl is supposed to symbolize some of the horrors of the Holocaust in a simple little plot device package, but I really feel it ruins some of the character motivations of Oskar Schindler. I feel the scenes would have been so much better if Schindler was more obviously moved by the horrors going on around him rather than simply the little girl, it's very confusing. Because of that scene and the later scene with her dead, and the way he acts around Amon in general, sometime’s it’s really hard to pick up on how he feels about the things he’s seeing. I really, don’t think it Neeson’s performance either. In the scenes where he really does need to be emotional, like at the end when the war is over, and when he’s determined to save everyone he really shows how he’s feeling very well. But the parts with the symbolism being his motivations makes it very difficult to show how he feels about it and why exactly it’s motivating him to save everybody. So I think it’s the writing of it in general, the symbolism can really distract from the real things happening in the film sometimes. I know that’s being a little harsh but those things really stuck out to me so I thought I’d mention them and see how everybody else feels about that. Overall it was great though. 9/10"
TrueFilm,39sy21,lordhadri,8,Sun Jun 14 16:10:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, you really did have a great week! Those are all amazing movies, I would love to experience all those for the first time again.   Kurosawa is my favorite director and I've seen all of his films (except three that I can't locate) so it's always good to see someone else getting into his filmography.  I would suggest watching either Ikiru or Seven Samurai next.  Kurosawa has two types of films, the very human, deep ones that are full of messages and the beauty of the world. They're his dramas and are often more character studies. Rashomon is one of those. If you want more of that atmosphere, check out Ikiru. After that, in the same category watch Red Beard, one of his less watched movies, and less accessible than Ikiru or Rashomon, but it's fantastic.  Then there's the other side of Kurosawa. The fun action packed side that influenced the make of the modern action film. You haven't seen any of this side of him yet, but it's definitely what makes him more well known. His most famous film is Seven Samurai, so I'd probably go with that for an entry to these films. After that I would check out The Hidden Fortress, which is my personal favorite, then Ran.   So it's all up to you, if you want more Rashomon, Ikiru is your next step, if you want to be introduced to the other side of Kurosawa, Seven Samurai.  Most of his films are worth watching though, and you're at the tip of the iceberg. He's one of the greatest filmmakers to have lived, and you're in for a ride."
TrueFilm,39sy21,Inception_025,6,Sun Jun 14 16:24:05 2015 UTC,"I second Red Beard. It's one of my favorite films. It kind of breaks my heart that it's not remembered more. It's the end of an era: his last B&W film, his last film with Mifune, his last period drama until Kagemusha. It's so essential to understanding Kurosawa and his work and yet it's so often skipped over."

TrueFilm,39sy21,Inception_025,2,Sun Jun 14 21:13:03 2015 UTC,Very true. I really hope Criterion Collection releases Dersu Uzala sometime. I have this version and its quality could definitely be improved on.
TrueFilm,39sy21,lordhadri,3,Sun Jun 14 21:18:35 2015 UTC,"Cons you recommend to me his great dramas? Quite honestly, I'm not that big a fan of his action films (they're fine, but I don't adore them as others do), but I do like Rashomon and would like to see his other works in that vein."
TrueFilm,39sy21,Stack42,3,Sun Jun 14 17:04:29 2015 UTC,"His great dramas would have to be Red Beard, Madadayo (which some people seem to hate, but I love it and I think it's among his best), Ikiru (of course), High and Low (I'm not sure if this would fall under either category. It's a noir, and more of a thriller than a total drama) and maybe Ran (which has the action of his samurai films but the atmosphere and attitude of his great dramas).   Those are my favorites, but I would also recommend The Bad Sleep Well, Scandal, Stray Dog and One Wonderful Sunday. Not as high on my rankings but still films I'd recommend."

It's missing a lot of the usual Western attributes but it has the setting down and I think that's the most important bit. Plus, there's a few traditional westerns before and after it that cover that same basic territory of gold mining and ownership.  For Kurosawa, Throne of Blood and Seven Samurai. Since you liked Rashomon so much you'll probably enjoy all of it."
TrueFilm,39sy21,Stack42,3,Sun Jun 14 20:41:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah the gold mine, the setting (location wise at least), and some of the themes and characters make it feel like a Western to me.   I have an interesting one for you for a few similar reasons. One of my favorite films ever is There Will be Blood, do you think it should count as a Western?"
TrueFilm,39sy21,lordhadri,3,Sun Jun 14 21:46:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah it almost seems unfair to let No Country for Old Men be a western and not There Will Be Blood. I don't have a definitive answer, just some differences you might think about. Daniel isn't really the anti-hero but an outright bad guy, so he doesn't conform to any of the usual western protagonist types. The story doesn't only take place in the 20th Century, it's also about oil, which means the setting is 'modernity' rather than 'the frontier.' The thing about westerns is that it doesn't really matter when they happened or if they happened, it's just all one big hunk of American folklore. Whereas There Will Be Blood pretends like it could have been real historical events, but then again, you can say that about Treasure of the Sierra Madre too. Some of the movies PTA is probably thinking of, like McCabe&Mrs. Miller, are westerns, but others, like Chinatown, aren't. Finally, I haven't read Oil! but what Upton Sinclair was all about isn't what I'd associate with the western genre as we know it. The most obvious genre to impose on There Will Be Blood is that of a historical novel adaptation actor-driven prestige drama - we need a shorter term for that - but it doesn't mean its themes of greed and community building and religion aren't derived from more obvious westerns."
TrueFilm,39sy21,QuickManIsUnbeatable,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:48:36 2015 UTC,"That's a very great answer. There Will be Blood is one of the most confusing to classify films I've ever seen, and I really still am not sure what to call it. Like Sierra Madre the setting is perfect. Like you said, and I agree with you, the setting is one of the most important parts. And the time period is even closer to traditional westerns than Sierra Madre. But the themes are completely different like you said, none of the main characters feel like western characters, and none of the plot has traditional western problems. No Country for Old Men has a bit more of the feel of a western setting and story wise on the surface, but when analyzing it deeper it feels more like Noir in some ways, yet it's often called a ""Neo-Western"".  I think that's a good way of classifying There Will be Blood. When I'm talking about it with people I usually just say its a drama above anything else."

TrueFilm,39sy21,lordhadri,2,Sun Jun 14 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"I love coming here and finding someone else watched the same movie this week.   Rashomon I finally got around to watching this yesterday thanks to TCM on demand.  The breaking of storytelling conventions with its multiple points of view is something to appreciate. But I still felt the film had a hallow feel to it. The conversation between the characters in the woods always felt unbelievable and I can't say it felt that way by intention. Specifically hearing the husband, when he was portrayed both noble and petty, condemning his wife to kill herself without any hesitation or conflict in his request right away made me question if I was paying attention to the story or missing crucial points earlier. I understand the culture and times depicted were different, but the performances and dialogues are still putting me off.  The concept of the different stories were certainly engaging, but not for the entirety of the film. I won't call it a novelty, but it's seemed to stand alone at times in the film as something interesting on screen or in story. Personally I felt more engaged hearing the stories being told at the court dialogue than I did seeing them refilmed and portrayed in visual reenactments.  I lot of the film (only 120 minutes) feels extended with its score and excess of shots. You can argue it's an older style, but I'd argue it feels closer to a modern film style in the sense of over-scoring and exhausting it's coverage.   I was underwhelmed with the final confrontation about morality at the temple. Much like the selfish character said earlier in the film, I'd rather listen to the rain than a sermon.   Sounds like a lot of complaining, but I didn't hate the film. I wouldn't recommend it to people either. It's considered such a great film, but I can't say it compares to his later works. Hope we can open a discussion. And I'll always be open to a second viewing of any film I see. For now, I think it's overrated."
TrueFilm,39sy21,afewthoughtsonfilm,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:32:36 2015 UTC,"I think the way each scene in the woods is shown is intentional. It sometimes feels like some of the people in the woods are shown acting out of character from what you see of them from earlier stories in specific stories, on purpose. Each story is told through that persons point of view and memory of the situation, and is supposed to be looked at skeptically. Even the final story I don't feel is supposed to be the exact truth. The Woodcutter lied in the court about finding the body in the first place, whose to say he didn't lie about what he said really happened in the end, or just didn't remember correctly. Same with everyone else. Maybe the medium is fake and is just making everything up how she feels the Nobleman would have felt about it.  I personally feel the Bandit and Woman are obviously lying to cover up their pride or honor. But that's just how I feel. You or someone else could feel completely different from what you see. Someone could watch it, see the first story from the Bandit's point of view and accept it as fact immediately and think the subsequent stories are all lies. And that is absolutely amazing to me, that a film can do that. That's why I loved it so much. The story may not be the greatest thing and be kind of simple overall, but the way it's told and handled is incredible to me."
TrueFilm,39sy21,lordhadri,16,Mon Jun 15 21:07:20 2015 UTC,"My Little Spring Breakers: Friendship is Magic Harmony Korine, 2012: Spring Break is the master image of American debauchery and yet I’ve never met anyone who admitted to doing it. Have you done it? Is it an East Coast thing? So I always felt like in real life it’s a tourist trap for people who are trying too hard. Understandably, a certain kind of filmmaker loves making movies about it though, and Korine actually does something worthwhile with the standard tropes. Spring Breakers says all it needs to say in the first half and then becomes an awkward version of Scarface with no main character. Ashley Benson is great on Pretty Little Liars and in this movie so I was disappointed she wasn’t shown more here: when Korine rips off Malick he inherits some the inscrutability of some of Malick’s characters too.       The Sun Shines Bright John Ford, 1953: At first this is a comedy about Confederate veterans and former slaves coexisting in Kentucky but then turns into a moving story about hypocrisy and intolerance. I also liked how it says ‘hell no’ to turning into a courtroom movie. It’s not one of the most well-known Fords but is certainly one of the best, with a performance from Charles Wininger that’ll make you weep.    Doubt John Patrick Shanley, 2008: A post sex-scandal version of The Bells of St. Marys. I often think about why it is that people who try to do the right thing end up doing the wrong thing instead; I can scarcely think of a better examination of that than this movie.    The Driver Walter Hill, 1978: Seems nobody can talk about this now without mentioning Drive so I’ll just say that this movie has a car chase directed like a submarine hunt for the hell of it and I can’t think of any other car chase movies that have that.    For some reason I have to go to another library to get Blade Runner so instead this week’s ultra-long getting-it-over-with movie is  World on a Wire Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 1973: This movie is like if the corporate intrigue story in Tron was the whole movie and they never go into the computer. Part I is the sort of science fiction I’m not a big fan of that’s all about conversations and doesn’t do a good job telling you who the characters are. Part II is better because it has more sex and explosions in it. Like Tarkovsky’s Solaris, I dig how they fashion a futurist world out of minimal elements but it’s also like that movie in not being very entertaining.    Rewatch - Aparajito Satyajit Ray, 1956: Theatrical 4K restoration. Not my favorite of the trilogy, but does have some of the best individual moments.   Rewatch - The World of Apu Satyajit Ray, 1959: Theatrical 4k restoration. See it on the big screen if the revival comes near you. It has some wonderfully poetic sound editing that has full effect in a large theater."

When I first watched Spring Breakers, I certainly agreed with you on that.  However, on ensuing visits, especially with Korine's other works as a frame of reference, I don't believe that to be the case any more.  Its far more than just an indictment of spring break culture; rather, I would argue its more about female empowerment and sexual liberation.  The women that stay to the end make it out on top, besting all of the men and staying in complete control over their sexuality (as seen in the threesome scene in the pool).  When I first watched the film, I assumed that Korine favored Selena Gomez's character for leaving the dirtiness of the spring break world behind; now, I would argue he criticizes her for giving in to societal standards rather than remain free."
TrueFilm,39sy21,TrumanB-12,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:34:26 2015 UTC,"Oh it would definitely suck if it was either exploiting or indicting spring break, since that would be hypocritical. I know it's just using the iconic setting to make a bigger point. Any sort of realistic depiction of it would be no fun.  Like I said, I just didn't feel right that it stops having a main character. Unless the main character becomes Alien but that doesn't work either. Britt and Candy are the least interesting of the four and always function as a unit that keeps them from being individualized. (I still don't know which was which.) Which is too bad as Ashley Benson is probably the best actress among the four.  What I took from the ending is that the criminal life just isn't for everyone, but for Britt and Candy, that's the only life that's right. Spring Break may be less hypocritical than America the rest of the year but Faith just isn't an alien. I identify more with that feeling, lol.  And now I need to see Gummo."
TrueFilm,39sy21,afewthoughtsonfilm,2,Sun Jun 14 15:45:37 2015 UTC,"Gummo's pretty great, definitely one of his best (though I definitely prefer Trash Humpers).  Quite honestly, I would say Spring Breakers is my least favorite of his; it has great moments but never reaches the heights of his other works."
TrueFilm,39sy21,TrumanB-12,2,Sun Jun 14 15:55:00 2015 UTC,Could you explain to me a bit what Gummo and Trash Humpers are? I've been really intrigued by Korine since Spring Breakers but there is zero information on his other movies on the web. I've seen some trailers and they seem to be rather similar to Kids/Ken Park by Larry Clark.
TrueFilm,39sy21,afewthoughtsonfilm,4,Sun Jun 14 19:29:55 2015 UTC,"It's funny you mention the connection to Kids because it was written by Korine and was what gave him his big break into cinema.  I think the best way of describing Korine's work, especially the stuff pre-Spring Breakers, is that they are the epitome of anti-bourgeois cinema.  His films often alternate between being dark and grotesque and being humorous and upbeat.  With Spring Breakers being the obvious black sheep in his filmography, he cares little for the visual aesthetic of his films, instead blending a variety of cameras and visual techniques together to create twisted, dream-like worlds that feel a lot like our own.  His films are also often non-narrative, or at least aren't structed with formal beginnings, middles, and ends.  Gummo, his directorial debut, is, in some ways, a twisted version of Alice in Wonderland set in the small, white-trash town of Xenia, Ohio after a devastating tornado.  It's very non-narrative, cutting between about four characters and gathering a snapshot of their lives.  It's a grim portrait of small-town suburbia in white-trash towns and Korine frequently switches between the use of more cinematic cameras for the scripted moments and handheld digital cameras that create a ""home movie"" aesthetic for the unscripted sequences (which also often are featuring people who aren't aware they're being filmed).  Gummo is often listed as one of the most disturbing films of all time (on this list as #39), yet what's interesting is that there is little in the film that is overtly grotesque.  Rather, it's the way in which Korine blends together the events on screen (as well as his frequent usage of non-diegetic music to contrast the images on screen) that is disturbing to some.  It's one of the masterpieces of late-1990s cinema.  Trash Humpers, I suppose, could almost be considered a spiritual successor, only Korine takes it a step farther here.  Many people despise this film or belittle it for being a waste of time; I couldn't disagree more.  Trash Humpers is a Dadaist film, a work that deliberately acts as the antithesis to traditional cinema as a means of questioning not only what the audience considers to be art, but also what the purpose of art should be.  It follows three (or possibly four) people dressed up in terrible old person make-up as they run around a small rural town humping trash, screaming, occasionally acting violent, and mostly just screwing around.  There's no narrative, there aren't really any characters, and it's shot on a video camera from the 80s so it looks absolutely awful.  On an objective level, this film should fail in every single way; there's seemingly no redeeming quality whatsoever.  And yet, what makes Trash Humpers so valuable is the way in which it forces us to examine what matters in a motion picture.  What is art, what should it be?  Should the visual aesthetic, the inclusion of a narrative and compelling characters, have that much of a bearing on a work of art?  It's such an important question, especially now when one evaluates the utter lunacy of most blockbuster cinema.  If you're interested, it's posted here in its entirety.  Korine's other two works, Julien Donkey Boy and Mister Lonely, are also quite exceptional as well (I haven't seen Julien yet, but everyone I know who has adores it) and fall into the same vein.  If you like Larry Clark, you will probably like some of his stuff as well.  He's a really important voice in contemporary cinema, showing us a side of humanity that few others do and asking us to consider if they are worth it to us as an audience.  Few people dare to go where he dares and I admire him quite a bit for it."

Think I paid like 400 bucks for the room for a week, plus free drinks and free door at a lot of local places.  On top of that there were events held the length of the beach the whole week.  Everyone from MTV to the US Army had stages and promotional stuff going on."

I'm sure people from all over do it, I remember getting ads for vacation packages at my dorm in Missouri. But drunken beach parties must just not be a Midwest thing."
TrueFilm,39sy21,lordhadri,2,Sun Jun 14 19:52:37 2015 UTC,"Well this was in FL.  There is no spring break in New England really.  I think most people go to FL or Mexico.  And these are spots where it's definitely sanctioned, when I went, it was Panama City Beach, FL, and the whole place geared towards spring break the week I was there.  They even had an episode of COPS filmed, saw a few people pulled over with cops and the COPS van behind."
TrueFilm,39sy21,lordhadri,3,Sun Jun 14 19:58:47 2015 UTC,"Well I guess at least someone has watched and wrote something abot World on a Wire since I never see it mentioned anywhere and none of the people I know in realife apart from a teacher and my dad knew it. But on the other hand it is one of my favorite movies and it doesn't seem like you liked it.   I can really understand why you don't exactly like the first part, it is slow and lacks some things that might draw peoploe into movies, there are no big explosions or a lot of action happening. I watched it quite a while ago so forgive me if I forget something but that was one of the things I liked, you really had the feeling that a universe was being build, not just a rushed 3 Arc standard movie that is utterly predictable. The freedom that a two-piece ts film has in comparison to a normal 90 minutes film is, in my opinion, freeing. It allows the director to set his own pace and, if he manages to do this correctly which I'd say Fassbinder accomplished here, it can really turn out great.  So I guess I can't really disagree with you but still it is one of the only sci fi movies which is both very realy as well as being full of vision and ideas, especially if you consider the time period it was made in. Perhaps the newer movies of this sort, The Thirteenth Floor and similar movies would be better suited for you than."
TrueFilm,39sy21,kingofthejungle223,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:31:02 2015 UTC,"Slow isn't quite it, and this movie never spends too long in the same place. (I was half joking about the sex and explosions.) Maybe it works better if you know German, but that could point to a different issue - is it styled just to be styled, with the camera not actually telling the story? I'm not sure, since I didnt have either issue with Fear Eats the Soul.  The TV series model can allow for more time to create characters and worlds, but Fassbinder resorts to one of the more annoying things about their storytelling for me. Part I spends the whole time building up to the plot twist that hooks you into the second episode. Part 2 immediately recapitulates everything and then proceeds to just tell the story because it can build to the real ending. Compare that to The Matrix, which covers about the same amount of ground in half the running time.  So yeah, I wanted to like it, and could tell a lot of it went over my head. It's not a bad movie but probably wasn't the Fassbinder I should have watched."

Milton has gotten success, whatever that means, so now he's scared. He won't take any risks at all. - Alfred Borden  Christian Bale is M. Night Shyamalan, a trickster who uses sleight of hand often and hopes you won’t notice, but once you’ve seen all his tricks before you hate him. Tesla is akin to a true cinematic wizard, such as Stanley Kubrick, who can amaze you in new ways all the time. That makes Hugh Jackman none other than Nolan himself, a mediocre magician who compensates with distracting showmanship.   It was interesting to see this movie for the first time after all the Nolan debates of the past few years because it has a reputation among his haters for being the okay one. However, I hated it. It’s an artist’s manifesto movie that shows its blatant contempt of blockbuster audiences. So that’s how he really feels about the audience and it completely explains his style of filmmaking that dominates the audience without caring to tell a good story or point to the outside world.   That’s why a movie that’s essentially about two rivals trolling each other and concealing their identities with fake beards (this happens, what, six times?), and stars David Bowie as a mad scientist, is absolutely no fun at all. And don’t get me started on the role of women in it. The movie also bizarrely ignores its own advice. It tells you to pay close attention, yet proceeds to explain its own trick (plot twist) for two hours, then outright tells you that understanding how the illusion works isn’t what you want from movies anyway. You just want a good show.  The problem with that is that if you do pay close attention, it fucks up visually and logically over and over. You could record a whole commentary track on things that make no sense in it. The ways in which Nolan is distracting you from the truth, like the fake beards, become completely obvious. To anyone who still likes this movie, the movie isn’t congratulating you for keeping up, it’s congratulating itself on making you like it. Yikes. Fight Club did this kind of thing better."

The movie was really intense and quite scary but still somehow believable. 9/10  Tokyo Drifter (1966)  This movie is known for being really stylish and if you liked Drive (2011) you should watch this movie. Most of the stylistic decisions were pretty awesome and the movie was quite violent. Unfortunately i found that a few of the stylistic decisions were quite bad (specially the scenes that take place in snow). The pacing of the movie atleast for the first 2/3rd is really bad.

It stars Danny Aiello, Samuel L Jackson, John Tuturro, martin Lawrence, Rosie Perez and it's SOOOOO good. Definitely Spike Lee's best. The cinematography is some of the most interesting of any film ever IMO and the story deals with race in a very complicated and non-cut-and-dry way. We saw a special screening of it last night at the Hollywood Cemetary and Questlove presented it live and talked about how the same issues are still going on now, and pointed out that one of the key scenes in the movie just happened in real life.

TrueFilm,39sy21,afewthoughtsonfilm,7,Sun Jun 14 20:20:22 2015 UTC,"I am on letterboxd, for those interested.  Another week over already?  Man, time flies.  I didn't watch as many as I hoped to this week, but I still saw many great films, including reaching my 200th first watch of the year!  Notably, I watched (almost) all of Jacques Tati's films (I'll be watching Parade later today, so that may be featured on next week's).  If you haven't seen his films, check them out; Criterion has a beautiful box set of his works that is honestly the jewel of my collection right now.  I wish I had the time to write a longer post today to more thoroughly flesh out my thoughts.  Anyways, without further ado, What I Watched this Week (in no particular order)   Greenberg (2010) dir. Noah Baumbach - Another week, another Noah Baumbach movie crossed off my list.  While it didn't reach the heights of his masterpieces - namely, The Squid and the Whale and Frances Ha - Greenberg is definitely in the upper tier of Baumbach's body of work.  It takes a lot of skill to be able to have you main character be so painfully frustrating and yet still make the film a great watch.  This may be the best performance I've seen Ben Stiller give; as the titular protagonist, he does a phenomenal job at capturing the nuances of a person suffering from anxiety.  Some of the themes Baumbach works on with this piece, such as how one reconciles the fact that the life they lead isn't what they planned on, are interesting ones, yet overall, the piece didn't resonate with me as much as I'd hoped it would have.  It's still very good, but never reaches ""greatness"". Somewhere (2010) dir. Sofia Coppola - I did not expect to like Somewhere as much as I did nor in the ways that I do, yet here we are.  Having only seen Lost in Translation by Coppola, I haven't paid much attention to her style as a filmmaker.  To my surprise, Somewhere is a shockingly mature film in terms of form, a perfect example of how limited dialogue and engaging visual language make great cinema.  The characters in this piece hardly ever speak, and when they do, they almost never have something super important to say; however, it doesn't matter what they say, but rather what is happening onscreen as they say it.  This is a strong example of show-don't-tell and it works wonders in this piece.  Coppola gives us a snapshot of the life of her central character - a young, attractive movie star - to show how the sweet life ain't as sweet as people may think.  However, what I find even more poignant is how she portrays loneliness (something she also does a heck-of-a-job with in Lost in Translation as well).  This film really spoke to me in ways I never expected it to. Irreversible (2002) dir. Gaspar Noé - No film has managed to get under my skin like this since, well, last year's Under the Skin.  The first hour minutes of this piece alone are such an assault upon the eyes and ears that it's hard to come out of the film with any sort of good feeling.  This film is brutal with a capital B, aided by an incredible score and a rapid, roving omniscient camera.  The big ""trick"" of this film is that Gaspar Noé tells the entire story in reverse, giving us each scene backwards in order to completely alter the context of what we're seeing on screen.  It sounds rather gimmicky in a Memento sort of way, but where Memento doesn't use its gimmick for anything much larger than the twist ending and to feature a high-concept idea, Irreversible clearly uses the format for some much larger ideas about how we perceive certain actions in a society.  In essence, I would argue that the meta-textual takeaway of this piece is that context defines everything, that our perspectives on certain events or people are subjectively influenced by the context surrounding them, not on the events or people alone.  It's a really profound piece, for sure, but boy is it a lot to stomach.   Jacques Tati's Films   Going into this project, I had only seen M. Hulot's Holiday and Mon Oncle, the latter of which immediately entering my pantheon of favorite films.  Tati is such an important filmmaker and my only wish is that I had seen his films sooner in life, as they are such an absolute delight.  Tati's compositions within the frame are some of the best that cinema has to offer and his films, notably Mon Oncle and especially Playtime, are also intellectually complex works.  Because I don't have time to fully flesh out my thoughts, here are links my my writings from Letterboxd:   Jour de Fête (1949) M. Hulot's Holiday (1953) Mon Oncle (1958) Playtime (1967) Trafic (1971) - An unfortunate disappointment.  This film not only abandons some of Hulot's core qualities, but it's also surprisingly lacking in Tati's visual style.  These are some of his least interesting compositions and it certainly is his least interesting film.  I can tell he's working with some larger themes about advertising, consumerism, and the effects of technological progress on the human spirit, yet it never becomes very clear how each add up (or at least, not to me).  Much like the car in the film itself, the themes never seem to reach their final destination, making the film feel slightly underdeveloped and unfinished, which is a shame given it is M. Hulot's final outing.   I also watched The Son (2002, dir. Jean-Pierre & Luc Dardenne), Vernon, Florida (1981, dir. Errol Morris), *Standard Operating Procedure (2008, dir. Errol Morris), and Capturing the Friedmans (2003, dir. Andrew Jarecki).  Feel free to ask me to expand on any film."

He didn't have many materials at his disposal, but with what he had, I felt that he managed to pull of a resounding success. All of Tati's main films (between Vacances and Trafic) are all 10-stars in my book, just varying levels of perfection. Though Trafic is at the lower end of that spectrum for me, I still think it's thoroughly engrossing from start to finish and, in some ways, is a bold new experiment from Tati: how to make the most out of limited setpieces, a hairstring budget, and a final Hulot romp? I wrote extended thoughts on the film a couple of months back, I thought they might interest you.  But that's great that you're doing a Tati month! Without a doubt, one of (if not the) best directors to grace the cinema."
TrueFilm,39sy21,cptnhook,2,Mon Jun 15 00:46:06 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely give that a look over later!  And to be honest, I think some of my sentiments are predicated by the fact that I watched it only hours after Playtime and especially considering the lower budget, anything would pale in comparison.  I definitely intend to revisit it in a few months as an independent film without thinking of it in contrast to his other works.  It was his only film that rubbed me the wrong way, so I have to imagine that in due time, it'll have a larger impact on me.  After all, my first viewing of M. Hulot's Holiday was neutral, but now I really, really enjoy it.  And I totally agree, Tati is one outstanding director.  The fact that he isn't an enormous name in cinema history is completely outrageous to me; there is so much to learn from him."
TrueFilm,39sy21,cattymills,8,Mon Jun 15 01:39:08 2015 UTC,"Ready to Wear (Prêt-à-Porter) (1994) directed by Robert Altman  Robert Altman's Ready to Wear features a sprawling mass of characters grouped around Fashion Week, in Paris, France. I don't know if I could call them each fully realized people, or even people at all, but that doesn't matter. They, along with their escapades, are each handsome, gorgeous, incandescent, petty, ridiculous, sycophantic, callous, trivial, tragic, synthetic, looming, guileless, alluring, or down-to-earth -- that is to say, they're all fascinating in their own way. And they're linked to each other, some strongly and some tenuously, in some way, whether it be by an artificial-in-every-way reporter, a looming thief, a fashion collection, or maybe coincidentally intersecting goals. And in those moments where you see that the expansiveness, the ostensible mess, is really a well thought out, intricate machine full of whirring parts are awing.  This is mirrored in the film's mise-en-scène. The film takes full advantage of the splendor of Paris and fashion, as each frame is filled to the bursting -- whether with crowds; the beauty of the architecture and fashion; or, as it often is, both. Yet, somehow the roving camera and impeccably timed zooms are never overwhelmed by what's in the frame, are always in control of it, and have no troubled finding expression and intimacy among the bustle. And there are these moments where there's this one shot, sometimes it's at the end of a scene and sometimes it's at the beginning, that puts all the prior shots that comprised the scene, each of them usually excellent in their own right, into context, renders the skill behind them so clearly and transform them into a whole in a way that's breathtaking.  All of the multitudinous subplots feel like there building to something, a reason why they're so transfixing to watch play out, but not all of those payoffs come, or they're anticlimactic. Except for one setpiece at the end of the film that is astonishing, even if I didn't agree with its thematic intention. But, I found that the anticlimax works for the film's 'true' theme and that last sentence true for most of the film. Most of the film -- except for a short stretch before the end, the reason for my half-star deduction, where the satire's intended target becomes more overt-- doesn't come across as satire. The accusations against the fashion industry are so broad that they're easily applicable to all people, and for that matter seem more wise when they are. Instead, I kept on coming back to this quote in the film describing Fashion Week: ""there will be lapses in taste and dazzling moments of rare beauty."" We can be awful and ridiculous, and we are that most of the time, but we can also be more than that. Prêt-à-Porter is a beautiful ode to imperfect humanity.  ★★★★1/2  One From the Hear (1982) directed by Francis Ford Coppola  What. A. Mess. ""Okay, so, the film might be about exploring how two people who once loved each other grew apart so disparately. No? Well, that's probably to complex for a Francis Ford Coppola film. Alright, it's about two people learning how to move on after a long term relationship. Actually, it's about how a shitty destroys clearly the best things that's happened to him. A bit simplistic and cynical, but if anything Coppola can make simplistic, cynical films great. What?? They get back together?? This about destined lovers??"" Yeah, the endings probably offensive in how distasteful it is, and it's completely out of nowhere (not in a good way). But, for what it's worth, it coming at the end minimizes the effect it can have on the entire film. The two leads have zero chemistry, but are more than fine apart, so I assumed that was a good thing, but I guess not? Furthermore, this is stylistically audacious in the most way possible of those words, but it doesn't really work, though it is something. Without an incredibly strong love story at its core and despite Coppola's considerable skill, it just overwhelms everything and has the zoning out effect similar to copious explosions in a dumb action movie. Despite all that, though, there are some achingly beautiful moments. Hank singing ""You are My Sunshine"" when it's (ostensibly, I suppose) too late is incredibly poignant in spite of what we know about him. And, despite what came before it, the concluding crane shot that moves away from the lovers on the balcony to day breaking over (set) Las Vegas while the piano tings is sublime, a fine moment in cinema.  ★★★  Flesh + Blood (1985) directed by Paul Verhoeven  I wish I could've seen Verhoeven's original vision for this film, as it certainly looks like this was one fairly mangled by the studio.   In Paul Verhoeven's introductory American film, he show's no hesitation in impresses on the audience his exuberant affinity for sex, violence, and generally being a real weirdo. At first, unlike in his other films, this trio doesn't really make much of an impression. Partly, this is due to the only moderately sized budget -- I got the impression that Verhoeven wanted to make a true medieval epic, but due to the lack of resources instead we see a bunch of small scale brutality which isn't very impressive for obvious reasons. Moreover, there's nothing impressive driving this thing and giving reason to it. Plot wise, it's driven by a studio-mandated love triangle that -- despite being given a slight feminist twist and a decent performance by the femal lead, Jennifer Jason Leigh -- isn't captivating at all, and as for subtext: there is none. And, on top of that, Verhoeven doesn't capture and stage things in an interesting way like he did in his later American blockbusters. It's dull, and the panoramic shots of the even duller European country sides certainly don't help with that.  But, then in the last forty minutes or so the film begins to take shape as it turns into a story of the progress of civilization and capital over barbarism and superstition. This sudden subtext seems to invigorate the rest of the film. The love-triangle is suddenly infinitely more compelling and the sex and violence more affecting. Plus, the addition of siege warfare and the bubonic plague spice things it up greatly. Verhoeven's presentation becomes only marginally more noteworthy in those forty or so minutes, it's weakened by a lack of balance between the two dueling sides -- Rutger Haur, representing barbarity, becomes incredibly magnetic while his counterpart, Tom Burlinson, is the opposite of that in every way, which throws things off -- and a problematic -- studio-imposed, no doubt -- ending. But, with all that said, the film becomes riveting, and its being reliant on the boring prior bits make them feel worthwhile, if they don't quite redeem them completely.  ★★★  Spy (2015) directed by Paul Feig  I haven't seen a film this lazy and this distasteful in a long time. It's like they thought could redeem incredibly banal direction by throwing in lots of slow-mo, (unaffecting) gore, and heapings of pop songs. That they thought they could make this funny and redeem that god-awfully trite and terribly presented story with lots of obscenity and general repetitiveness. Gore and obscenity don't do anything if they're presented in such an uninteresting way. Melissa McCarthy could only elevate this a few times -- she's completely chained down. So very boring.  ★"
TrueFilm,39sy21,cptnhook,4,Sun Jun 14 14:56:20 2015 UTC,"Spy is a very Paul Feig movie from what I've heard. If you weren't already into the over-the-top violence he includes in his movies, this probably wasn't going to be the one to make you a new fan. Calling something lazy and distasteful because of the appearance of gore is like calling a wall lazy and disgusting because it's owner made the decision to put a Descendants poster up."
TrueFilm,39sy21,Digitalis2512,5,Sun Jun 14 16:31:25 2015 UTC,"Paul Verhoeven includes lots of over-the-top violence in his movies, and I never call them lazy and distasteful -- in fact, I love them -- because he actually uses the violence in service of something and presents it in an interesting way. Feig does neither of those two things."

TrueFilm,39sy21,ImmaBeAlex,3,Sun Jun 14 16:50:39 2015 UTC,"I started off with Se7en and was a little disappointed. The movie was good, but uneven, especially with regards to plot. Example: kills 1 through 5 were planned, sloth especially, but envy and rage could not have been since they just moved there. You could argue that maybe he had other people lined up, but wouldn't they have noticed that from the evidence in the apartment and protected them?. It felt like a bunch of (talented) guys had hit on a really good idea for a movie and made it up as they went along. Aside from plot, I liked the feel of the movie, it was like what I thought noir was before I saw any noir films.  Drive, good, kind of a warm action movie. You all have probably talked this one to death anyways.  Not too sure where I stand on The Breakfast Club. It was cringey, especially the monologue at the start, and Alison was a overplayed sometimes. On the other hand I was laughing more than I do with most comedies; maybe what was new about it just looks cliched to me, except that I also watched Rebel Without A Cause, and despite some parts that were meant to be edgy, but looked quaint now, I felt it was a better movie. It felt like the issues were more real, or more serious; Rebel reminded me more of Drive than it did of The Breakfast Club, because it felt more like ""this is something that's part of my life"", than ""this is a thing that sucks"".  I moved onto Perfect Blue, first Kon movie I've seen. Felt a little apprehensive at the start, thought it was going to be another kind of dolly anime girl movie, but I think Kon was well aware of the genre and played on that to make it something much more.   Psycho was better than I'd hoped. I'd seen North by Northwest before, and was expecting a chase movie, particularly when the road cop showed up. Something a liked about it was a shot when Bates is talking to Marion, where there is an owl in the background, very symbolic.  Followed that up with Parpika. This movie made me feel like I'm starting to be able to identify with films, as opposed to just thinking ""that was a good movie"", or whatever. I don't want to repeat Every Frame a Painting, but I can understand what he means by Kon's good editing.  Next week, I hope to finish up on the Kon movies, maybe give the old movies another go (M), not too sure yet."
TrueFilm,39sy21,calcio1,6,Sun Jun 14 15:55:31 2015 UTC,"It's probably not best to treat Se7en logically, I think the point of it is to be a horror movie where John Doe can't be defeated by the best intentions and that's what makes him really scary. But yeah, it probably could have been done better.  Kon loved to play with genres, he works a little bit of everything into Tokyo Godfathers and Millennium Actress."
TrueFilm,39sy21,holybuttwipe,3,Sun Jun 14 21:00:15 2015 UTC,"The Descent  I finally watched this in the past week. At 10 years old, when I watched the trailer on ""quicktime.com"", I was immediately horrified but also interested. And this expanded into one of those things-to-do-that-take-years. Granted, I find it better to have watched at this point in my life where I have culminated an appreciation for film over the years instead of seeing it at a young age and possibly screwing up my perception of the movie forever. Luckily, the wait was well worth it! It was so refreshing to see a horror movie that has a quite subjective story told in a linear fashion, with a central theme solely understood by the writer that we as the audience have the pleasure of interpreting to our own liking. At this moment, I like the idea that she never woke up, that she is now approaching death as her brain begins to shut down. This is symbolized by going deeper into the caves and her companions dying off, each representing a different part of the brain - Juno being the Id being fitting as that is the first psychological stage of life. She finally comes to accept her death as she finds something eternally peaceful in the memory of her daughter, just as the final light on her torch is about to distinguish. Along with the well-written story and non-stereotypical female tropes, the film also boasts beautiful cinematography and set design. The creatures are unique and terrifying, the lighting is minimal and effective, and the scenes in the narrow passages had me so tense that I was shouting at the screen ""No! No! No!"" while they are literally just crawling around. The sense of claustrophobia that I got was on-par with what it feels like in real life, let alone in a fucking cavern hundreds of feet beneath the Earth's surface. Overall, I'm glad I downloaded an HD file right after seeing the movie, because this film deserves a boat load of rewatches, which I will gladly give to it."
TrueFilm,39sy21,isarge123,3,Sun Jun 14 15:57:42 2015 UTC,"Gonna do the last 2 weeks, hope that's ok  West Side Story (1963)   I know it's a winner of umpteen Oscars and regarded as a classic, but I found my attention flagging. Great production design, good to hear familiar songs in their original context, but I was left a little, dare I say it, bored. Saul Bass credit sequence and Officer Krupke song enjoyable  Winter Light (1963)  Second film in Bergman's 'Silence of God' trilogy, about a priest struggling with an existential crisis. I found it less bleak than the first, Through a Glass Darkly, and the acting and cinematography from his regulars, as ever, is top notch.   Mondo Cane (1962)  A seminal 'shockumentary' looking at strange cultural practices around the world. Exploitative yes - not one for those traumatised by images of animal cruelty - and mildly racist at times, but absolutely fascinating throughout. Great to see, in particular, footage from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan as I live in HK.  The Given Word (1962)  Brazilian film about a man who carries a giant cross for miles on a pilgrimage to repay a promise he made to a saint who 'saved' his donkey - only to find the priest of the church branding him a heretic because he actually prayed to the Candomble god  - the slave religions became blended with Catholic saints to hide their worship from the masters. Terrificly done, funny and trenchant as a mob builds up around the man who refuses to leave and vested interests - the newspaper man writing his story, the cafe owner getting rich from the crowds, the pimp who wants his wife - exploit the naive  bumpkin. Winner of the Palme d'Or.  Aliens (1986)  Rewatch. Some of the dialogue has worn a little cheesy, but otherwise this is just a terrific action movie. Interestingly that very little happens for the first hour, but everything - relationships, world-building, Ripley's power-suit experience - is set up for the rest of the film. Would you see an action film these days with such a patient build-up?   The Dark Knight Rises (2012)  Rewatch. Hadn't seen it again since the cinema. Meh ... I dunno. Plenty of people have torn apart the various plot holes and unlikely premises. It's fairly nonsensical in every aspect but just about manages to hold together.  My Life to Live: A Film in 12 Tableaux (1962)  Godard classic about a Parisian woman's descent into prostitution. Interesting approach with the episodic format, and almost documentary-like look at prostitution of the time. Hasn't left a lasting impression, I'd have to admit.  Locke (2013)  Some more Tom Hardy. This is essentially a one-man play, Locke driving for the entire film to a rendezvous that is going to change his life and not necessarily for the better. A great idea perfectly executed. Hardy is tremendous as the harried construction manager dealing with colleagues and family on his speakerphone, and the way it's shot, with lens flare and reflections from the motorway ensures the single 'set' doesn't become boring.   Blonde Cobra (1963)  An avant-garde experimental film from the New York underground. Half of it is just black screens as 'performance artist' Jack Smith rants and freestyles rather boring stories intended to shock. The other half is just ham-fisted footage of Smith messing about in his garret. I thought it was nigh-on unwatchable.  Heaven and Earth Magic (1962)  Another 'experimental' piece, animation made from cutouts by Harry Smith, another 60s oddball. Very interesting for five or 10 minutes - the influence on Terry Gilliam is clear - but rather wearing for an hour.   Tucker and Dale vs Evil (2010)   Had heard good things about this on Reddit. Not as enthused as some on here, but it's a fun take on the killer hillbillies horror trope. Enjoyable but not on Shaun of the Dead par for me  Scorpio Rising (1964)  Another 60s underground classic ... oh dear. But this one, by Kenneth Anger, whose Hollywood Babylon books are essential reading, is excellent. Entirely without dialogue, it tells a story of sorts about gay nazi bikers led by Scorpio. Terrific contemporary pop soundtrack throughout, commentating on the action, and very interesting use of montage to contrast religious symbols etc with sexual imagery. Very professionally done and with something to say, unlike Blonde Cobra.  L'Eclisse (1962)  Third of Antonioni's trilogy after L'Avventura and La Notte about relationships and ennui in contemporary Italy. I saw the other two in the cinema, and watching this at home I found my attention wandering a little. I must admit I missed the point of the ending too until I read up about it. Monica Vitti and Alain Delon are always easy on the eye and fun to watch though and the fascist 'new town' area and the stock market scenes are both interesting in different ways.   The Trial (1962)  Saw this somewhat overlooked Orson Welles film based on the Kafka novel in the cinema. Some terrific shots from Raoul Coutard, the Nouvelle Vague's go-to guy, and featuring appearances from many of the beautiful actresses - Jeanne Moreau, Romy Schneider, Elsa Martinelli - of the scene. Anthony Perkins of Psycho fame is excellent as the bewildered Joseph K, and the absurdity of his nightmare leads to some black laughs. Great giant sets in the Gare d'Orsay. Welles called it his best film and it certainly deserves more fame than it seems to have. Surreal, Lynchian, in the way it conveys dream-like imagery and logic on the screen.   Barren Lives (1963)  Another from the Brazilian Cinema Novo, this has something in common with The Given Word but is not of the same class. Follows a poverty-stricken family as they traipse across a desert, eventually finding low-paying work, only to fall on hard times again. Interesting enough, but I'm not sure it says anything novel about the misery of poverty."
TrueFilm,39sy21,holybuttwipe,5,Tue Jun 16 08:27:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry my comment won't be as in depth as all the others. I simply don't have the mental capacity to write a review for movies. I watch. I enjoy.  A Clockwork Orange (1971) I've been putting this one off for some reason. I don't know why, I'm a huge Kubrick fan. It was every bit as good as I had hoped. Malcolm McDowell was amazing.  O Brother, Where art Thou (2000) Another I've been putting off. The Coen Brothers are actually my favorite directors, so I really don't know why. It was great. I loved the humor.  Psycho (1960) My first Hitchcock film. Was not disappointed. I've always loved horror movies, so I felt obligated to watch this classic. So glad I did.  There Will Be Blood (2007) I finally got around to this one. And while I can respect it, I really didn't enjoy it. I think it was mostly because Daniel Day-Lewis' character is such an asshole. I love me some Day-Lewis though.  The Big Lebowski (1998) (rewatch) I've seen this movie so many times I've lost count. It never gets old. I think The Dude is one of the best written characters I've ever seen.  No Country For Old Men (2007) (rewatch) I watched this for the third time this week. Still as good as ever. I think Javier Bardem played that character better than anyone could have.   2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) (rewatch) I talked my friend into watching this one with me. He didn't enjoy it, he's more of a  ""Jason Statham-suit wearing-explosion"" movie type guy. I still love it though.  Breakfast At Tiffany's (1961) (rewatch) Another I've seen way too many times. I really just can't get enough of Audrey Hepburn."
TrueFilm,39sy21,jburd22,3,Sun Jun 14 21:08:00 2015 UTC,"That's a fantastic week.   For more Hitchcock, I recommend Rear Window (my all-time favourite film), Vertigo, Dial M For Murder and North By Northwest. They're are all good starting points."
TrueFilm,39sy21,allhewhoknows,2,Tue Jun 16 02:25:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I've been meaning to watch Vertigo, but I just haven't yet. I'll definitely watch all of those."
TrueFilm,39sy21,Inception_025,6,Tue Jun 16 02:29:50 2015 UTC,"New to doing this, going to do this more often. All watches this week were for the first time so I would love to discuss them.  Deliverance This is a film that my Dad has been on me for ages to see and I must say it is great. All of the films I saw this week were really good but of them this would be my favourite. I've known of the premise for a long time, ""the vacation from hell"" sort of thing, and also who doesn't know the line ""Squeal like a Pig"". The thing I was most surprised to see was just how patient and non hollywood it was. There is a tendency for hollywood films to show everything clearly and for the audience to know exactly what is happening, but where this film succeeds is in its state of confusion. Take the infamous rape scene. Many other films would have played that for suspense and shock, but here it feels akward, and real. Less of a ""oh my god this is happening"" and more of a ""is this really happening?"" The performances here are all great, with the banjo kid for me being the scene stealer. I love how the plot line unfolds also, how there is a lot more conflict after they kill the second hill-billy (which you would think would be the climax). This is not a film about set-pieces (though they are certainly here), instead it is about moral dilemmas, and watching how these unique characters deal with them. This is a high recommendation.   The Sting I went into this film with high expectations, after being wowed by Butch Cassidy, and while I don't think this film is up to that standard, it is certainly a great film. Despite this films high profile I had no idea what it was about, so the opening was so much fun discovering just what this film was. I knew by the title that there had to be some sort of big job, but just seeing how all of the big players fit in was a blast. That being said, once the ball got going, while the charm of this film was overwhelming, I must say there was a significant lack of tension for me. I felt ahead of the movie at all times and none of the antagonists were particularly intimidating to me (especially since we spend the whole second act embarrassing the big bad). There is still a lot of fun here. Even though I knew where this was going, it was awesome to see just how it got there, and that was surprising. The whole supporting cast here is great but the real standout is Paul Newman. Man is he a great actor. I must say I highly recommend this, though If you haven't watched  Butch Cassidy I'd say watch that first.  Total Recall (1990) So I'm a Schwarzenegger fan, and a Paul Verhoeven fan, so the fact that I haven't seen this before is shocking. I mean I've seen almost all of their other respective films. Going into this I knew It wasn't their best work and seeing it only reaffirmed my opinion. There is a lot to love here, Sharon Stone is a BADASS, Arnold has some of the best one liners of his career, and the film has a nice brisk pace that never gets boring. My biggest disappointment with the film was the effects. almost all of the models looked fake as shit, and a lot of the backgrounds have some of the worst integration I've seen from a film in the 90's. That being said, my favourite part of the whole film was the production design. From the facilities, to the taxi, to that x-ray security wall, all of that was great. All of that was highly inventive, but never quite felt real. I felt a bit robbed of the movie since I knew all of the iconic moments and ideas from the film going in, and all I was experiencing was how they were all connected. However, the world created here is so imaginative and incredible that the film is easy to recommend on that aspect alone.   Jurassic World I saw this on Friday, along with the rest of the world as it seems that this is going to break every box office record imaginable, and it was good. I am a huge fan of the first film ( as is everyone) and just as a direct sequel to the first, this film is satisfying. Now you can take my opinion with a grain of salt since I enjoy pretty much every instalment in this franchise. This film is constantly trying to have it's cake and eat it too, but it sadly does not work on a meta level in the way that Lord and Miller have with the Jump Street films. This film is LOADED with flaws, my biggest of which is that the plotline makes no sense. Everything with Vincent D'Oforio was just the worst and I didn't exactly understand the causality of the film. This films goal should have been protecting the people stranded on the park, yet in this film the crowds felt like an afterthought. The reason why I would recommend this film is that it full-fills the promise of the first, which is seeing the park in function. All of that stuff was amazing and had such a sense of wonder. I also liked all of the human characters (except for Vincent D'Oforio of course), particularly the two brothers. I actually really enjoyed their interaction and completely believed them as brothers. The  action scenes here, are fantastic and harken back to the simplicity of the first ones action, even if it never quite lives up to it. While most remakes (yes this is a remake) just pail in comparison to the first and feel completely underwhelming, this one does something different. It revels in the connection between them. It feels more like a celebration of the legacy of Jurassic Park, rather than a replacement. There's a reason why they save the T-Rex for last. I feel like a lot of you on this sub will hate this film (and there is a lot to hate) but for the rest, and the general movie going audience, this is a high recommendation. There is just so much fun to be had in this movie."
TrueFilm,39sy21,Inception_025,5,Mon Jun 15 00:17:47 2015 UTC,"You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010) - Woody Allen  Woody Allen has either made a film supporting spirituality, which would be a first in his career, or he’s made a damning satire of spiritually-minded people that is far more agressive and hateful than any of his other work, or he just wrote whatever came into his head and started to wrap it up just as it got interesting because he hit the right page count. I’m honestly confounded as to which one it could be. The acting is fine for the most part, with a talented cast lending their own personas well to Woody Allen’s dialog. Niomi Watts is as charismatic as ever, but her English accent seemed shaky at best, fluctuating in proficiency depending on which actor she’s working off of. Josh Brolin seems bitterly adamant to not do a Woody Allen impression, leaving his character a bit flat and uninteresting. After seeing most of Allen’s filmography, I’ve gotten really fucking sick of the dumb bimbo character he throws out every second film or so. It’s shocking, especially for a writer as good with female characters as Allen, that he’s relied on this trope so much. To Rome With Love, Mighty Aphrodite, Whatever Works and now this. It’s gotten really old, mister, and it makes you look a right misogynist. The way shots are filmed can be interesting, but most of the film is buildup to a payoff that doesn’t happen. The ending leaves four of the film’s five storylines unresolved in a way that just brushes them under the rug. I could be wrong, and it could be a brilliant defamation of spirituality in the modern world, but it could also just be a load of rubbish. And I think it may be a load of rubbish. 4/10  Anything Else (2003) - Woody Allen  Was very satisfied with this one. After seeing Allen do so much meandering in his last few films, it was an indescribably fresh change of pace to see him do something so focused. It’s about a young comedy writer, his girlfriend and writing associate and how he relates to them. That’s it. Now that Allen isn’t juggling fifty different plotlines, he has time to build character, tell jokes, embrace mood and apply some of that cinematic style he recent films have been so lacking. There’s a cut in the film’s first scene reminiscent of the French New Wave in how jagged and unapologetically wrong it is. But the scene is probably the better for it, so who cares? The film has lots of interesting, memorable stylistic touches like that. Some of them are things Allen has done before (a hell of a lot of it is just a rethread of Annie Hall) but there’s a life to it that’s absent in so many of Allen’s other rethreads. Mainly in Allen’s character, who is easily the most hilarious, memorable and enjoyable characters Allen has ever played. He subverts so many of the tropes plaguing Allen’s characters in ways that are unexpected and welcome. And the ending is suprising and interesting enough to really make you reflect on who the characters are and what they could become after the credits roll. Very well-made and interesting. 8/10  Hollywood Ending (2002) - Woody Allen  And we’re back to silliness. When I first heard of the premise for this one, I scoffed like I had never scoffed before. I figured this had be Allen’s worst. A film director goes blind mid-way an expensive production and pretends that he can still see so as not to freak out the executive producers. I thought it would just be repetitive slapstick routines for two hours. And it was, but I found it quite endearing despite that. In between all the bumbling around and yuk-yuk situational stuff, we get musings from Allen about cinema that I found very interesting. His views on studio executives, working with a crew of mostly foreign filmmakers he admires, a set designer who attempts to build a life-size Times Square, comments about Hitchcock cracking the code by being both commercial and artistic, it’s all very interesting. The film’s use of color is so undramatic and televisual that the film may well have been directed by a blind man (with at least colorblindness). Many of the shots are flat and none of the drama is reflected in the filmmaking. Although the writing had it’s moments of intrigue and humor which may overshadow the poor filmmaking for me. The last few scenes of the film are very good, and the movie’s final joke hits the bullseye and justifies the film’s existence on it’s own. Elements of the film make this seem like one of Allen’s most personal films (the protagonist has a conflict wherein he is no longer in contact with a son from his first marriage, which has a few similarities to certain controversy that haunts his work to this day), it’s only a shame this wasn’t better directed, as it could have been a career highlight for the director’s later work. 5/10  Slumdog Millionaire (2008) - Danny Boyle  The most recent Best Picture Winner I had yet to see. Unfortunately, this film seems far too Best Picture-y for it’s own good. When you’ve basically taken a real-world group of people living in terrible poverty where kids are forced to beg and steal for a gang leader who then puts them into child prostitution rings and turn it into Forrest Gump, then I’m sorry, but fuck you. That’s bullshit. Riddling this story with childhood romances based on glances, running after trains, damsels in distress and so many other overdone tropes makes this world seem all the more fabricated. Thusly, any real-world sympathy for those born in slums supposedly being influenced by the film is emotionally manipulative and founded on false pretence. You haven’t made a movie depicting slum culture, you’ve made Oscar bait that hides behind a genuine cultural issue when it actually just doesn’t want to give it’s audience anything they haven’t seen a million times before. Some decent drama towards the end regarding the lead’s relationship with the host of the titular game show was what I saw as the film’s only flash of actual creativity. 4/10  Life is Beautiful (1997) - Roberto Benigni  Great movie. Great great great movie. I would probably say even the best depiction of the Holocaust in cinema, at least that I’ve seen. It captures it’s period so perfectly in all aspects, including cleverly incorporating cinematic styles of it’s period (the film’s first half feels particularly like a Chaplin film). The storytelling is cinematic and rewarding, Benigni’s character being a particularly well-written hero. The film doesn’t pull any punches, but rather allows information to be drowled out slowly, making further discoveries of Holocaust brutalities all the more shocking to every character. I found the ending to be particularly important, as it subtly expressed how important it is to remember the great horrors of history, despite the film potentially delivering the opposite message with a clumsier writer at the helm. 9/10  Bernie (2011) - Richard Linklater  Linklater is one of the great American filmmakers. He seems to be a director skilled at his craft, and constantly pushing what he can do with it. With Bernie, he seems to be tackling the based-on-a-true-story film and the documentary simultaneously. He’s asking questions about truth, lies, manipulation of facts and when/where it can/cannot be justified. How much of cinema is a lie? How true can a film really be to real events? This is a film that has a lot to think about, but always keeps it’s tone light and never lets the heady breakdown of cinematic rules undercut the story. Really well-made, additionally. All performances are fantastic, especially by the non-actors. I never knew Jack Black could pull off something like this. Bravo to him. Murphew MurphConnaughey is also great, in one of the early roles of the MurphConnaisance. Seen by some as a lesser film in Linklater’s filmography, but containing more weight and intellect than most major films from any other director. 9/10"
TrueFilm,39sy21,lordhadri,2,Sun Jun 14 21:11:55 2015 UTC,"Ernest & Celestine directed by Benjamin Renner, Stephane Aubier & Vincent Patar (2013) ★★1/2  What Ernest & Celestine lacks in fun, it more than makes up for in artistry. This is a beautiful animation, and while I didn’t find it as entertaining as I expected to, I definitely believe it to be one of the most visually interesting animated films of recent memory. It’s the story of a bear and a mouse who want to be friends, but they can’t be because of class differences. Then they commit crimes together. It’s a weird story for a children’s film, because their friendship is entirely grounded in stealing and hurting others. Then in the end, when you think we’ll get a moral, the two troublemakers are just reunited and forgiven. I don’t know, maybe not what you should be putting in a children’s movie just for the sake of a happy ending. But lets disregard that and move onto what really impressed me. The world building is great, I love the idea of the two civilizations on top of each other that mirror each other in weird ways. I loved the moments with the two police forces, as well as the dentistry concept. And again, the watercolor design of the film is beautiful to look at and gives Ernest & Celestine a unique charm. May not be a film I loved but it was definitely charming.  Detachment directed by Tony Kaye (2012) 1/2 star  Adrien Brody was... good? I’m not sure honestly. I think he did really well, but with material like this it’s hard to tell. Despite Adrien Brody giving it everything he has, I was still laughing throughout Detachment, and it is not meant to be a funny movie. The whole thing was just so... detached from reality. I’m a high school student now, so I see how kids act, I see how we treat teachers, and Detachment could not be further off. Degrassi is closer to reality than this. We have students blowing up at teachers, teachers responding in equally offensive manners. Big melodramatic moments that would never happen in reality... anywhere. It was just so unrealistic, no one acts like this, high schoolers are people too, and even the rowdiest, most trouble making teenagers would not treat their teachers or fellow students in the ways seen here. If you want a movie that does everything Detachment does better and in a more accurate way, check out The Class. A real inner city school environment without the bullshit.  Sleeping Beauty directed by Julia Leigh (2011) ★★  This was so weird and I know it could have been really good if it just committed more fully to that weirdness. In essence, Sleeping Beauty sounds like a classic psycho-sexual thriller meets art house film. It could have been really cool, slow paced science fiction. But it felt the need to ground itself in modern day reality, which brought it down a ton. Even though the real plot of the film centers around a secretive organization that hires beautiful young girls to fall asleep and let men live out their dreams with them, it doesn’t want to embrace the dystopian possibilities of this. I feel bad that I watched something and my main criticism that makes me dislike it is “it would have been so much better if they played it a different way”. Criticisms like these annoy me usually. I try to take films as they are, not as they could have been. But there is just such a gap between the strange surrealism of the sexual scenes and everything involving the organization and the real mundane life of Emily Browning’s character. Give me more of what you promised with that concept please.  Love & Mercy directed by Bill Pohlad (2015) ★★  There were really two sides to The Beach Boys, the experimental side, the musical genius shown in Pet Sounds (which the movie details the making of in one story line), and the generic side, the side that made hip doo-wop tunes that were pleasant but exactly like everything else on the radio. Love & Mercy also has two similar sides. The experimental and the generic. On one hand, it does do something new with the biopic format. Maybe it isn’t new, but I can’t recall the last time I saw two different actors playing the same person at different parts of their life, cutting back and forth between the two. The non-linear form and change of actors helps the movie out a lot. However, it is also painfully generic in some parts. The older Brian Wilson stuff was just bad. I’m not sure if John Cusack was bad, or if somehow that was how Brian Wilson acted. I know he was depressed and wacked out on tons of medications, but Cusack’s portrayal felt over the top. I also found myself bored at times. It was way less interesting than a movie about such a tortured genius like Brian Wilson should be. The songs from Pet Sounds work amazingly as instrumental score though, and Paul Dano is fantastic as young Brian Wilson, possibly his best performance yet next to Prisoners and There Will Be Blood. Otherwise, Love & Mercy is a let down.  The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford directed by Andrew Dominik (2007) ★★★★  From the opening sequence, where Brad Pitt as an outlaw wanders through fields of wheat, staring into the distance as the narrator sets up the movie, I knew this was going to be special. I’ve seen it mentioned many times, but it’s always good to hammer home the point that the movie is getting across. History is unreliable and sees things the way the historians saw them. Our narration feels like it’s being read out of a history textbook, giving us the facts, plain and simple. Yet the narration often doesn’t match up with what is actually going on on screen. For example, the narrator may say that Jesse James blinks more than a normal man, but when he says this, we see Jesse staring into the distance, not blinking a single time. And in fact, Robert Ford is not a coward at all as we learn through the film. Roger Deakins does excellent work as always here. He and Chivo are both really fighting it out for the best working cinematographers right now. No one can match their quality of photography. Brad Pitt also kills it as Jesse James, honestly I think this is one of his best performances, and though it seems like Casey Affleck got all the recognition for the film, Pitt was my personal favorite. Great movie, can’t wait to watch it again in blu-ray on a bigger screen."
TrueFilm,39sy21,Inception_025,3,Sun Jun 14 14:46:47 2015 UTC,"Young & Beautiful directed by François Ozon (2014) ★★★1/2  Young & Beautiful is the story of a nymphomaniac seventeen year old who decides to become a prostitute for cheap thrills. She has no attachment to the money, she has an excellent life, she doesn’t feel under valued, she simply likes sex. It’s a really interesting character study. It takes this type of person that we tend to over analyze and think poorly of, someone who throws a decent life away for the thrill of sex. It takes this person and shows her in a very human light, makes us question our judgments. We can’t think poorly of her as much as we want to, because we understand. I also have to give credit to this film for surprising me more than most movies. I never had any clue where it would go next, it’s packed with satisfying twists and turns. Young & Beautiful is a very pleasant surprise.  rewatch - Kill Bill: Vol. 1 directed by Quentin Tarantino (2003) ★★★★  Perhaps Tarantino’s most viciously over the top film, as well as maybe his most entertaining. It’s by no means my favorite, but in terms of just non-stop fun, this has it all. It bounces from scene to scene, changing styles all over the place, taking everything to the extreme. It goes from kung-fu, to spaghetti western, to giallo, to anime. It really spans so much, and makes such a ridiculous story feel so epic, just in approach. The scope of styles and genres it uses make it more grand than most other films of its type. The visual style is also pretty fantastic. Scenes like the Crazy 88 fight scene will stick with me for a long time, not just because of the copious amounts of blood spraying everywhere, but because it is really interesting to look at. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is the epitome of style over substance cinema.  Spy directed by Paul Feig (2015) ★★★  I was really iffy on this movie up until Melissa McCarthy’s character met Rose Byrne. That’s when it got great. The second hour of the film I just had a giant grin on my face that didn’t really wipe off until ten minutes after the movie. Rose Byrne was fantastic, all the potential that I saw in Neighbors last year was brought out to its fullest, she crushes this role. Melissa McCarthy is also great, especially when she starts pretending to be a bodyguard and verbally abusing everyone around her. She’s really in two types of movies, the ones that consist of her being the subject of fat jokes and really nothing else (like Identity Thief or Tammy), and the ones that treat her as an actual human being and don’t rely on her weight for their comedy (like this or Bridesmaids). Paul Feig said that he wanted this movie to be a spy film first, with comedy coming second. I think he succeeds in that. It’s funny as hell, but it is first and foremost a spy movie. The jokes go places because of the plot, the plot never goes places because of the jokes. Highly recommend checking this one out in theaters.  Titanic: The Legend Goes On... directed by Camilo Teti (2000) no stars  My friends and I are starting doing group “bad movie nights” and our first one was last night. I usually try my best to avoid watching bad movies, but when you’re with a group of friends and you can make fun of the film the entire time, it’s really a good time. Titanic: The Legend Goes On is one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen. It’s an animated version of the titanic story, trying to capitalize on James Cameron’s version while also straight up ripping off every Disney movie ever made. The animation is terrible, rarely ever in sync with dialogue. Mouths move when there’s no talking, sometimes they don’t move when there is. It’s like they had a script that they animated the film to fit, and then before recording the dialogue they decided to change everything but couldn’t go back and fix the mouths. This is a movie that has a rapping dog, offensively drawn Mexican mariachi mice, a kind of unknown incestuous love story that is totally disregarded in the end but the implications are way too strong, and it makes sure we get a happy ending for every character in the story. This is a magnificent achievement in shitty movies. It is hilariously bad, to the point where it used to be the worst rated movie on Imdb. As the nostalgia critic, who reviewed it and granted it new found popularity, says. “This is the Titanic movie where you’re rooting for the iceberg”. If you’re into shit like this, it’s on YouTube, and it’s one hell of a time.  Dracula A.D. 1972 directed by Alan Gibson (1972) ★★  Part 2 of bad movie night was a tribute to Christopher Lee. A great actor with a great career who once said “every actor is in bad movies, the trick is to never be bad in them.” You can definitely see that here, and his, and the rest of the cast and crew’s refusal to be bad in this movie actually elevates it from total shlock to actually pretty decent. Dracula A.D. 1972 is the story of how one of Dracula’s disciples collected the count’s dried blood, and passed it down in his family for 100 years, till 1972, when the family decides that it’s time to resurrect Dracula in modern day London, where Dracula now goes after the descendants of Van Helsing. Sounds awful, but the people involved with making it knew they were making a bad movie and wanted to make it as good as possible. So even though there’s this ridiculous premise, the actors play it straight, and actually all do pretty well while also having fun with every ridiculous moment. The camera work is also surprisingly really good, the film looks really nice, the framing and composition are really well done. Even though I wouldn’t say this is a really bad movie, because it has tons of merits, I would definitely say that it falls into the same category. It’s B-Movie shlock, it’s fun to watch with friends, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Film of the Week - Kill Bill: Vol. 1"

I really didn't. And it managed to be astoundingly bad besides that. Holy shit, the editing and camera. The worst I have ever seen in a movie. No shot lasts more than 2 seconds and it can't stay still, it constantly either has to be zooming in or cutting. Liam Neeson running from cops? Better show 50 angles and different shots of hm driving a car. Liam Neeson making coffee? Same thing. Plus, the dialogue. Horrible. It's as if Microsoft Sam wrote the script as well. Forest Whitaker looks like he is about to fall asleep in every scene he's in. The plot is just complete garbage, a cheap ripoff of The Fugitive. In all seriousness, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. (0/10)  Somewhere  Dir. Sofia Coppola. A great look at celebrity ennui, about a divorced, newly minted movie star named Johnny Marco who hides away in the Chateau Marmont with his daughter. True to Coppola's other works, it's a pretty meditative and relatively uneventful movie, it's mainly about how the main character simply is not happy despite having everything else in the world to be so. Shots linger on, and are repeated to emphasize the repetition and boredom Johnny feels, and it works out to good effect. I really enjoyed it for the most part. (7/10)  On my list to watch: The Friends Of Eddie Coyle, A Colt Is My Passport, High And Low, F Is For Fake, Mad Max"
TrueFilm,39sy21,SuperBearJew,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:38:04 2015 UTC,"Drunken Master Directed by Woo-Ping Yuen (1978). This is the first Jackie Chan movie that was made in China and it really shows his comedic talent and also his comedic violence as these are not very well edited and framed in his American films. This film has a silly and simple plot: Wong Fei-Hung (Jackie Chan) is a rascal and an undisciplined boy who must learn the art of Drunken Fist Kung Fu to defeat a near-unstoppable assassin. One might expect that the opening shots would feature dear Jackie but like in The Dark Knight we see the power and the character of the main villain. He's very fierce, serious and undefeated Kung Fu warrior. This mirrors Wong as he is undisciplined and untrained. This behaviour leads his father to send him to Su Hua Chi, master of Drunken Fist Kung Fu,  who will teach his son how to fight. This is a well-choreographed movie as every fight scene resembles a dance between the combatants. This all boils down to the last epic fight where Jackie's character masters the art of Drunken Fist Kung Fu and defeats the 'undefeatable' antagonist. A fun movie that shows essentially show how comedy action should be made.  Jurassic Park Directed by Steven Spielberg (1993). A film that doesn't need much introduction as it is hailed as the greatest dinosaur and monster movie. You gotta hand it to Spielberg and his crew as this showcases one of the most breathtaking CGI even by today's standards. This is a real thrill-ride and proves to be one of the most exciting adventure movie. Although this movie has the ingenious John Williams, the timing for the music is perfect. These guys knew really well when to not use the music. There is a problem though: the characters. Most of the characters, excluding Goldblum's Dr. Malcolm, are a dull and the viewer seems to root for them merely because the're human. All in all, it's a timeless movie.  Dog Day Afternoon Directed by Sydney Lumet (1975). Al Pacino plays Sonny, an amateur bank robber, who robs a bank but his day is going worse than he could've imagined. The first sign of disaster is when one of the three bank robbers bail and leave Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) in charge of robbing the bank. This only precedes the greater disasters. Sal and Sonny collect a laughable amount of money but due to their carelessness the police and the media arrive. The robbery turns into a hostage situation and a media circus.  This is a great movie. Sonny is the best on-screen role that Al Pacino has had.  The greatness of this movie owes it to the improvisation of the actors and the countless rehearsals preceding this film. This movie really concentrates on the characters which makes this a great movie and timeless as the human mind and behaviour stays the same through time. Oddly, this movie made me think about 9/11, mostly because of the live coverage of these events. As these two situations are widely different, both contain a fair amount of tragedy and as humans tragedy entertains us.  Nuit et Brouillard Directed by Alan Reisnais (1955). This is a documentary that deals greatly with the morals, causes and consequence of the Holocaust. The title refers toa strategy instigated by Himmler in December 1941 that helped propagate the fear of the Third Reich. Anyone caught resisting the Nazi occupiers would be arrested and then immediately whisked off to the camps in such a way that they would vanish without a trace, ""into the night and fog"". This movie is just a half hour long but it grabs you by the neck for a half hour and makes you look into the cruelties of the Holocaust which makes you questions human nature and the morals of ideologies.  Three Days of the Condor Direcetd by Syndey Pollack (1975). The film features Robert Redford as a bookish CIA researcher who finds his colleagues dead and must find out why the government is trying to kill him. Almost four decades before Snowden's leak, this movie shows us that when something is uncovered the government will do its best to hide that which is uncovered with all possible means. The movie shows the cat-and-mouse game as Redford's character is constantly outrunning the CIA. The movie never overreacts in its conspiracies which makes the movie all too real and frightening."

TrueFilm,39swdr,yangYing,2,Mon Jun 15 10:46:57 2015 UTC,"There are non violent psychopaths (actually pretty common 1-5% of population) but antisocial personality disorder doesn't spontaneously develop in the way you're describing - it takes years of abuse and trauma to present. I've never heard of the kind of pervasive brain injury that could leave a person otherwise functional yet suddenly amoral. It's a complicated and large field, but the research suggests that psychopths are born, and they may or may not become violent depending upon their upbringing. So 'no' people can not become 'psychopaths'. Source postgraduate psych.  Walter White, however...? He might have had some sociopathic tendencies (psychopath isn't really a word we use anymore, anyway), where his imminent death and life regrets increasingly pushed him to ever more insulated and selfish choices... but even then, not really. I personally would consider him narcissistic ... NPD can result in some crazy behaviour. Quite when he crossed the line (he broke bad) is debatable (which is part of what made the show so powerful, all of us have a different opinion / a different boundary of good taste) what matters is there was some transformation. Had he been a psychopath from the start, there wouldn't have been any real change nor relatable quandaries, and it wouldn't have made a very interesting story ...   IMO Walter was interesting because he was relatable, and under similar circumstances anyone might act the same. Compare this with a classic film psycho (e.g Hannibal, or better, Buffalo Bill) and it's easy to see that they're different things.  Although the actual clinical definition of a 'psycho' is rather lengthy and convoluted, it can be best summarized with a lack of empathy, which would seem to suggest that a normal healthy person are themselves incapable of empathizing with a psychopath. Interesting characters and stories they may be, but never relatable, never sympathetic. Alien, shocking ... outside ... 'free' maybe, unconstrained ... powerful even :-/ but not relatable."

This is how he starts. As the show goes on he poisons children in order to maintain his plans. I have little interest in arguing all day about the psychological status of a fictional character or in the theories about how psychopathy comes into being but let's just say that Walter certainly went beyond something we can all relate to in similar circumstances. He started out relateable, he went off the reservation at various points."

TrueFilm,39swdr,Slickrickkk,7,Mon Jun 15 21:19:57 2015 UTC,"I feel exactly the same way. I've always loved movies that could make me feel any sort of sympathy for the ""anti-hero"", as you put it. For me, it creates a very interesting internal struggle as you try to separate your feelings from the reality of the matter (i.e. that they're bad people). It can also reveal the power of narration and show just how great of an affect the presentation of a series of events can have on one's interpretation of those events (I also love reading books that can do the same thing --> the novel, A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess, does the same thing and it's a fantastic read if you enjoy delving into the mind of a psychopath).   Off the top of my head, I think Taxi Driver is able to achieve something similar. I kept feeling bad for him throughout the movie and the state of his life (possible PTSD and all of that), so it gets you to come close to buying into Travis as the ""hero"" at the end of the film."
TrueFilm,39swdr,salierniwasokay,6,Mon Jun 15 22:01:05 2015 UTC,"I feel the exact opposite is true of Taxi Driver. I think that the first half of the movie (before you start to kind of realize anything is really wrong with Travis) is trying to get you to sympathize with him and understand him. So that when you do start to notice something is off you still want to trust and understand him, and you still feel he's a hero at the end."
TrueFilm,39swdr,CDC_,3,Thu Jun 18 15:42:57 2015 UTC,That doesn't sound like the exact opposite at all. Sounds like you're agreeing with him.   possible PTSD    That's putting it lightly. /u/salierniwasokay

He is an insular character with very low interaction and communication skills, living in a very delusional state of mind. For me, the only reason to root for him is out of pity, and not because of likability."
TrueFilm,39swdr,Flubby2,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:27:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the novel is pretty ""hit-or-miss"" with most people. One of the challenges is getting used to Nadsat. I felt like quitting a couple of pages in, but I decided to give it a shot and the language really grew on me over time.   And good point on Travis. Rather than charming, I suppose he's more of a psychopathic character that you can feel sympathy for because of the way the story is presented."
TrueFilm,39swdr,ifyourheadexplodes,12,Wed Jun 17 06:10:42 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough, I feel like in the movie The Devil's Rejects, Otis is a likable psychopath. He has almost no redeeming qualities, yet he's easily the most interesting character in the movie. I feel like Rob Zombie has only made one really great film, and that's the one, imo. Something about the way Bill Moseley captures the character of Otis is just very intriguing to me. No back story, really, no rhyme or reason for the way he is, just an outright, unapologetic, psychopath. Anti-heroes in film just grab me.   Another good example I think would be Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood. By all evidence the man has almost no true feelings for anyone, other than contempt (with the exception of his ""brother"" and ""son"" for a short time.) As he has no family it seems he seeks out to find new family members he can relate to and confide in, and ends up just despising everyone, as he's basically incapable of real love. And yet I just love seeing him on the screen. I could have watched another 2-3 hours of that man just destroy everything around him."
TrueFilm,39swdr,rattlefoot,2,Mon Jun 15 05:40:43 2015 UTC,"I could talk about the devils rejects all day. I wholeheartedly agree about Otis too, I loved him even though he was such an evil person.

TrueFilm,39swdr,rattlefoot,2,Sun Jun 14 23:34:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I've been pondering that movie quite a bit due to it's narrative similarities to Taxi Driver, though some have argued that Taxi Driver was actually trying to invert the message of the Searchers entirely. It all really depends on how you see the final scenes of each movie, both of which can be interpreted several ways.   My favorite aspect of both films is how little they focus on the reaction of the girls that are ""saved"". I think it adds a very haunting and ambiguous nature to their heroic finales. Obviously they're trying to do what they think is best, but so is everyone in the girls' lives, so who can they really trust? Will we really know who the heroes are when they come around?"

He's more of a sociopath since he can't relate to anybody else but himself. But even though he can make a mean quip, he does try to make Annie into him in ways that reminded me of how Scottie tried to turn Judy into Madeleine: making her dress like him, read like him, have the same interests and obsessions as him...  Also, speaking of Vertigo, Scottie's a psychopath. He's a pure psychopath. He goes about trying to alleviate his vertigo the wrong way - and destroys many lives as he goes along.

TrueFilm,39swdr,onomuknub,4,Sat Jun 20 03:30:05 2015 UTC,"Well, i found the lead in Drive to be somewhat likeable (mostly via stylistic association i suppose), whilst being a incredibly violent sociopath. For me, the scene in the elevator, where he kisses his neighbour tenderly a few seconds before he methodically caving someone's skull into pasta sauce is thematically representative of the entire film."
TrueFilm,39swdr,dooml0r,3,Sun Jun 21 06:45:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's because of stylistic association. The film being stylistic (which I really wouldn't even call it so) has nothing to do with making him likeable. I think it's the fact that he's real innocent and quiet put together with Gosling's good looks and how he goes out of his way to look out for a young beautiful woman and her child, even after he finds out about her husband and meets him."
TrueFilm,39swdr,-AlternateEnding-,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:29:52 2015 UTC,"Well, pretty much every one of my favorite movies can be summed up like that. A guy with severe mental and emotional issues that he takes out on himself or others, despite being incredibly good looking and affable.   The most mainstream being There Will Be Blood, about an oil baron with a silver tongue who will literally let nothing stand in his way, and then slightly more nuanced would be The Master, which is about a disturbed WWII vet with incredibly violent tendencies and enjoys paint thinner. Yet despite almost cartoonish attributes, he's still completely lovable.   After that, my next favorite is probably Mommy, a French movie about a charming boy with severe ADHD and violent episodes with his mother, despite being able to come across as lovable and charming to others.   But my absolute favorite charming psycho? Easily Michael Pitt in Funny Games (US remake, of course). I really don't wanna say what that one's about for risk or ruining it. You just gotta watch it. It's that good."
TrueFilm,39t4nt,noxbl,18,Sun Jun 14 14:51:23 2015 UTC,I haven't seen Jurassic World but can I take a wild guess that Spielberg uses suspense a lot more in the ones he made?
TrueFilm,39t4nt,lordhadri,22,Sun Jun 14 15:47:46 2015 UTC,you are correct...there is little to no suspense build up in any of the action sequences
TrueFilm,39t4nt,Kylon1138,32,Sun Jun 14 23:10:40 2015 UTC,"I saw Jurassic World  last night and I noticed this too. For an action movie there really isn't very much action but the weird thing is there isn't a ton of exposition either. There's just a lot of bland filler of people traveling around the park. It keeps the story moving forward I suppose and it's better than exposition but it feels more like an advertisement for a nonexistent park than a movie at times. I found myself having a really tough time caring during any of the action sequences in part because of how short they were, but mostly because of how poorly written the movie is. There's no real reason to like or care about the two kids. The younger one has next to no personality and the older one is just a dick. Claire should be the villain because what happens in the park is her fault and the fault of people who think like her. She's related to the kids though so she's a protagonist and we're supposed to care about this horrible woman who thinks engineering super dinosaurs is okay as long as Verizon Wireless hands you a paycheck. Owen is only likable because he's being played by Chris Pratt. Even then I'm not sure because his character is just ridiculously stupid in concept and I feel like Pratt plays it way too straight. If it were 10-20 years ago I'd love to see Bruce Campbell or Kurt Russell ham it up as the former Navy serviceman turned velociraptor trainer."
TrueFilm,39t4nt,BorisJonson1593,10,Sun Jun 14 15:50:46 2015 UTC,"thats weird, because I felt the first chunk of the movie had a lot of exposition. It was a lot of park workers explaining to each other things they should already know, or at least thats how I felt."
TrueFilm,39t4nt,Nevtendo,5,Sun Jun 14 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"Well, compared to something like Star Trek: Into Darkness I felt like it was lighter on exposition. The scene where you first meet Hoskins and he monologues for like five minutes is definitely over the top but there isn't much of that. I guess what I'm saying is that the movie doesn't really stop very often to feed you exposition about stuff. It replaces a lot of that with glamour shots of the park and scenes of the two kids visiting different attractions. There's not a lot of forward momentum in Jurassic World (it's certainly no Mad Max: Fury Road) but it limps from scene to scene for the most part."
TrueFilm,39t4nt,BorisJonson1593,8,Sun Jun 14 17:47:27 2015 UTC,"I can see it having less exposition than other hollywood blockbusters, I agree. Maybe its sticking out because I just watched the movie. And yes the hoskins scenes witht he raptors were pretty over the top. There were also a couple of scenes with Bryce Dallas Howards' character in the control room, and with her boss where she just uses up the time to explaing things back and forth with them.   I agree that it limps from scene to scene, maybe not with exposition, but with other useless things that bear no importance to anything. Like the older brother checking out every girl ever. It leads to nothing? We already know hes a douche."
TrueFilm,39t4nt,Nevtendo,3,Sun Jun 14 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"Star Trek: Into Darkness wasn't ""heavier"" on exposition than other movies; it was exposition. It was the first film to successfully make the transition from exposition informing and explaining plot to exposition in lieu of plot."
TrueFilm,39t4nt,Clumpy,2,Mon Jun 15 03:03:40 2015 UTC,It seemed to me the first half hour of the movie wasn't exposition so much as really really clunky character introductions with a dash of exposition

In the original JP4 script, this character is a actually a mercenary hired to find Nedry's lost barbasol can of embryos for a company seeking to create an army of velociraptor (""deinonychus"" or ""deinos"" in the script) soldiers.  So, in the context of the original script, he makes sense. And he's basically exactly like that character was written: dryly sarcastic, completely generic action hero with no real background or motivation. It's almost like they were obligated to keep the character instead of coming up with a character who would exist in this universe (D'onofrio's character is also in the JP4 script with a different name, as are most of the scientists and executives)."
TrueFilm,39t4nt,BZenMojo,6,Sun Jun 14 19:19:54 2015 UTC,That actually makes a lot of sense. I'd be interested to know how many rewrites it went through and how many different writers it had.

TrueFilm,39slg4,solarplexus7,12,Sun Jun 14 10:30:05 2015 UTC,"I think that movies which retain the idea of the camera being a physical object tend to feel more ""solid"" than those that don't (even if the ""camera"" is actually a rendering viewport). Roughly, I think that camera movements which have a ""weight"" to them that corresponds to human movement relative to their target feels about right.  The same applies to CGI objects. Even if the texture of the object itself is a little lacking, usually proper shadowing, a ""weight"" to the movement, and a connection to the movement of the environment can compensate.  Scenes which have their attention on the ""cool effect"" rather than on ""the camera or character seeing the cool effect"" falter. A problem with CGI is that it can be a ""view from nowhere"" - they lose their origin point. And when we watch a film, it's important that our own perspective is felt to have presence.  I rewatched Word War Z last night and - although the film isn't super-successful - its effects are very well done. See this VFX reel. The camera always moves as if it is on a solid platform; the rendered objects move actually very slowly when you pay attention to them - momentum is provided by editing rather than making things ""happen fast"", which can result in objects feeling ""light"".  This got me thinking: When creating a CG shot, due to the narrow focus the process involves, is there sometimes a tendency to try to create within the scene the tone and excitement of the larger sequence? ""Faster, more intensity."" You end up with a scene which looks great in isolation, but it has lost its grounding and does not work in context. Actually, the individual shots should be ""slow and boring"" so as to retain weight and realism, because the combination of shots is what makes it ""happen""."
TrueFilm,39slg4,TriumphantGeorge,3,Sun Jun 14 10:47:55 2015 UTC,"Over the top proportions or unlikeliness of events playing out.    Agreed overall. It's not about the quality of the effects rendering, so much as depicting a situation which the viewer can empathise with - so that can have a felt, visceral response to it.  An overheard shot with a million dinosaurs galloping from roof to roof might sound like it should be amazing, but actually it will have much less impact than a boy trapped in a closet with the door slightly open, a shadow passing across his face accompanied by the sound of a giant beast. One shows off a technical achievement, the other evokes a direct experience.  Creating shots which make that direct connection is a subtle art. To some extent, you get that ""for free"" when using a normal camera and a practical environment - and you don't even know exactly what it is you are getting for free. When designing CGI, you suddenly have to be explicitly aware of those ingredients. I don't think that's been nailed yet."
TrueFilm,39slg4,TriumphantGeorge,10,Tue Jun 16 09:20:42 2015 UTC,"I think it might be because movies with no visual style in the first place give no visual style directing to their animators and so the CGI ends up looking the same as it does in every movie they do. Hence the term 'CGI crapfest.' They don't know how to use it sparingly or integrate it with the look of the rest of the movie. I mean, every David Fincher movie for almost a decade now has had tons of CGI but you probably never noticed any of it.    Dawn of the Planet of the Apes does indeed have pretty convincing motion capture but that final battle has the usual problem, the environment suddenly looks different from the rest of the movie, because they needed something that would look cool in 3D.  And with Fury Road, sure there are three or four shots that are more obviously CGI than the rest, but hopefully you're into the movie enough not to notice. First, that's because they bothered to make it look like the rest of the movie. And second, I think that it's possible to use CGI in a way that fulfills what some of the earliest silent movie directors would have loved to play with. Miller throws the guitar at you, then juxtaposes it with the symbolic steering wheel and has you fly through it as a transition. That's fully visual grammar there."
TrueFilm,39slg4,lordhadri,5,Tue Jun 16 09:27:52 2015 UTC,"To defend Jurassic World briefly, I will say that for a vast majority of the time the dinosaurs are onscreen and the way they are shot make the use of animatronics impossible. I really love practical creature effects like the ones seen Jurassic Park, Aliens, Pumpkinhead, An American Werewolf in London, and many others. I'm such of big fan of practical creature effects that it is an aspect of filmmaking that I'm considering  pursuing as career opiton (a pipe dream, I know), but I know that CGI is the only way many of the action scenes like the ones in JW could be done. The I-Rex and the raptors are running at high speeds, leaping at people, and doing other extraordinary things and are often shot in big wideshots. Stan Winston's beautiful animatronic T-Rex in the original film couldn't do these things being that it weight several tons and more importantly didn't have any legs. So it comes down to using CGI for these creatures or not doing them at all"
TrueFilm,39slg4,HeadlessMarvin,2,Sun Jun 14 14:34:31 2015 UTC,"With the notable exception of DotPotA, I think CGI is better used as a supplement to prectical effects, rather than replacing them entirely. Look at movies like Attack of the Clones or Man of Steel, where for some bizarre reason the directors decided to CG the armor worn by the clone troopers and Kryptonians respectively, rather than building practical costumes, and it looks bizarre and uncanny. compare it to Mad Max which really only uses CG to enhance the landscape and hide the stunt rigs, and it loooks fucking amazing for it. The problem with CG is the lack of proper textire it has, because no matter how advanced it is, it's still never going to look perfect in contrast to real textures. DotPotA can get away with it since the CG is actually being used to recreate human-looking movement in the apes: you're so caught up in the performances that the effectsbecome secondary. I hope with Mad Max and the new Star Wars this year, we begin to see a bigger return to practical effects."

He doesn't do anything towards that goal, instead, he just blows off steam, translating his pain into others.   If i were to choose I'd say that Bloom is way more scarier. He's completely focused, calculative, never leaves anything unplanned. He's completely in control of every situation. (Thing i liked a lot about this was the plant.

His life is an endless parade of rejection, and being yelled at, ""moved on"", etc etc. I have no doubt that if the scrap metal guy had given him a job, the scrap metal business would have taken off (probably in socially undesirable ways) but his attitude was all, ""fuck you, Lou"". He wouldn't even consider employing this creep.  I don't think we saw any of Lou's ""love life"" except for interactions with Rene Russo's TV producer character, but I expect that women reject him constantly. Had he fixated on sexual interaction instead of commercial interaction, he could be a redpiller or an MRA blogger like that creep who was whining about Fury Road.  This is part of what makes Lou frightening and relatable at the same time. Most of us experience this obstinacy and reluctance from the world, getting baulked and bullied by stupid, hostile ""authorities"". Give an idiot some power and he'll use it to fuck up your day for no damn reason except that he can; indeed he thinks it's his job to fuck up your day. That's sort of a joke/moan/adaptation for us to say, however it is actually how Lou thinks. He doesn't numbly accept it and join the idiots; he responds ""rationally"", in a goal-driven manner. He thinks outside the box. He knows that authority exists in the world as a thing solely to baulk him and fuck up his plans, and he responds rationally to that fact.  The problem is that his goals are strictly limited to his own advancement. Were he capable of advancing everyone's benefit, we'd be cheering for him as the plucky hero of endless other movies. Like Marion Cotillard's character in ""Two Days, One Night"", baulked by dumb hostile authorities who pretty much think the same way as Lou Bloom does.  Lou Bloom type of people are part of our social narrative, and these characters who ruthlessly pursue their own goals (and fuck what happens to other people) abound; the difference is that he is shown in the protagonist role, rather than as antagonist. I joked to my friend I saw this with that ""we just saw the origin story of Rupert Murdoch"", but it's not really a joke; fast forward twenty years and Lou Bloom could be a media magnate, funding and propagandizing for the Republican party of a red state. Fast forward fifty years and the car crashes he sets up could be labor disputes, or race relations, or environmental disasters.  Lou is what happens when we abandon concern for others entirely. When we use people. The temptation is there, for many of us, and it is fear of becoming like him that stops us."

Lou Bloom doesn't show characteristics of those groups at all. Lou Bloom embodies the poisoned American Dream, the pull yourself up by your boot straps attitude in a 21st century reality..  But the people you mentioned are not evil and they don't wish harm to anyone. I believe them to be frustrated young men whom had a rough start on life and were told that they weren't owed or perhaps even deserved love/respect/support by anyone. It is only natural that they turned bitter towards people who they thought to be responsible for their misery and find comfort by each others' company. Their portrait would be one of pessimism, depression and despair, one entirely at odds with the infamous laughter of Lou Bloom.  An opinion: Redpillers and Co. are wrong on many things and labeling them as evil or sexist or creepy is easy, but I would advise people to emphasize with their fellow man instead of perpetuating the eternal hate machine."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,aeschenkarnos,6,Mon Jun 15 11:47:54 2015 UTC,"Lou Bloom doesn't show that specific version of the thought pattern; what I am saying is that this mode of thought is not limited to desire for money (Lou's specific focus); it can also manifest in desire for sex, or desire to be obeyed. This type of individual gives zero fucks about anything except his goal, including your or my feelings, convenience, benefit or even life. You will be used, sidestepped, or attacked; no other viable options exist in their mental models for interacting with people."

TrueFilm,39qnpz,ned_stark_reality,11,Mon Jun 15 12:48:03 2015 UTC,"part of me wonders if the scrapping he was doing was simply a play to get his foot in the door at the construction company... he gets to demonstrate his negotiation skills, while also showing how he is willing to get his hands dirty... obviously he doesn't have the knowledge of humans to realize that no foreman would hire a thief, but maybe that was an attempt at building towards an empire rather than a need for cash. after seeing clearly that that industry is not one in which his machiavellian attitude will work, he stumbles on one that is unabashedly comprised of that attitude."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,WiretapStudios,8,Sat Jun 13 22:06:39 2015 UTC,"why do you you think Bloom was jobless?   Because in most other circumstances, his weirdness wouldn't be tolerated for long. Think of people like Hunter S. Thompson, or Bukowski. They sucked at normal jobs, but writing was perfect for them, (semi) flexible deadlines, no supervision, etc."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,564738291056,3,Sun Jun 14 07:49:11 2015 UTC,"I think he probably comes from a lower class background or has been thrust into a low class situation because of estrangement from his family caused by his evident sociopathy. He lacks an education, he lives in a plain apartment in a plain building. Growing up, due to his lack of social skills, probably resulted in him having a very unpleasant experience in school, maybe leaving it. I can see him, from there, landing a string of dead-end office jobs and ending up getting booted out after a few years again and again for just being unable to network enough to move up or for being violent when in a corner, resulting eventually in the desperate situation you start the movie in. His interview with Rick feels like entry level job interviews. The speech he delivers to the scrap manager feels like something engineered over a few jobs. I can see him deciding to be his own boss after that and hitting the books hard to build up all that business lingo he's echoing through the whole movie."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,JurijFedorov,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:28:54 2015 UTC,"I saw it as a: ""a loser finds his place in life"" story. He was just not emotionally connected to anyone to get a good job. And no one trusted him. But in media that was the right personality to have."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,DoctorBat,3,Thu Jun 18 11:42:50 2015 UTC,I would say Louis is more of a sociopath.
TrueFilm,39qnpz,Come_In_Me_Bro,0,Mon Jun 15 09:11:45 2015 UTC,His profile is absolutely more psychopathic than sociopathic.
TrueFilm,39qnpz,ned_stark_reality,28,Sat Jun 20 19:34:38 2015 UTC,"i recently had a train ride long enough to get the chance to watch nightcrawler (oddly enough, it was destined for LA). i live in los angeles, and so knew pretty much ALL of the places that the movie took place in; which added a TON of creepiness to the whole film...  i DEFINITELY felt empathy for louis, which, as you said, was terrifying. it so poignantly illustrated that although we all operate under the guise of being cognizant of others, doing any and everything to further your goals is really at the base of most of our decisions... and in that regard, is louis 'wrong' in operating with ONLY that in mind? is his lack of empathy a hindrance, or rather does it give him a leg up that we WISH we could have?   on another note, i really enjoyed the pacing of the movie... they just sorta drop you into his life without any context. if they showed him as a sociopath right from the beginning, you'd be able to hold yourself at arms length. but since it builds so slowly and deliberately, the small moral 'jumps' he makes seem almost... reasonable.   edit1: the beginning scene with the security guard, to me, was within the realms of what a desperate person would do in that situation. it was fascinating because right off the bat i accepted something as 'morally' OK that would be SO far outside of my comfort zone. that suspension of morality lead me to see the rest of his decisions in a different light; each successive decision within the context of his transformation seemed normal."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,DarionMigraine,19,Sat Jun 13 21:16:18 2015 UTC,The thing is the bit at the beggining (where he beats a security guard to steal his watch) already tells you he's a dangerous individual. But you don't notice because the movie makes you want to root for Bloom and so you see only what you want to see.
TrueFilm,39qnpz,ned_stark_reality,6,Sat Jun 13 21:26:25 2015 UTC,"That ending was amazing (right at the shoot out).  I was thinking ""Tv show"" or next movie.

TrueFilm,39qnpz,thatguywiththe______,3,Sat Jun 13 21:32:36 2015 UTC,"Whenever Louis and his partner spoke in the film, in a very large portion of his sentences Louis says Rick or Richard even when it was out of place. It was like a marketing tactic to constantly use his name and it actually stuck out to me at how often it was said.  Perhaps you were just not invested enough in Rick to remember his name being used."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,baba192,5,Mon Jun 22 17:18:43 2015 UTC,.. they just sorta drop you into his life without any context   I was a little confused about the security guy incident.    That seemed out of place.
TrueFilm,39qnpz,TheSoundOfHerWings,13,Sat Jun 13 21:24:25 2015 UTC,"I loved that. It just showed us exactly who he is, and made me terrified of him almost immediately. Anytime he was on screen with someone, I was worried for them, that he'd jump at them out of nowhere as he did the guard. Gave him such a powerful position."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,happybadger,7,Sun Jun 14 02:21:44 2015 UTC,"I love the security guy. It showed us right from the get go how far he would go while giving us doubt.

And at the end when he leaves the station we see the watch on his wrist (the one from the guard). it was a good full circle that connected beginning and end."

TrueFilm,39qnpz,lowfour,6,Mon Jun 15 11:48:59 2015 UTC,"I rewatched Nightcrawler and Drive back to back after my first time just to see how they introduce the sociopathy. Nightcrawler's opening scene is so well written, giving you a sense of Louis' depravity and establishing it as something only utilised when there's some objective in mind no matter how small that objective may be. Everything after was completely within bounds and there wasn't any ambiguity about what he wanted or what he was willing to do to get it. Gosling on the other hand only gives you the sense that he's a career criminal, which in my opinion doesn't set up his personality well and makes his executions seem really out of character, sloppy, and obscene.   Nightcrawler really sets the standard for this kind of character. He isn't a wanton psychopath like Patrick Bateman, he isn't a chaotic evil like The Joker, he's just a guy who lacks a really fundamental part of whatever makes us human. I'd love to see more films learn from that opener and use it to frame their own exposé."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,RubenD,10,Sun Jun 14 06:30:00 2015 UTC,"The difference between them is that driver cares a lot for the girl, his violence isn't calculated and cold and efficient, it's built up rage against those trying to hurt an innocent mother and her kid. He's sort of a noble sociopath."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,windupharlequin,22,Sun Jun 14 13:45:26 2015 UTC,"I just saw the film and totally loved it. As a former journalist myself I think the film does not revolt around Louis Bloom and his over the top psychopathy. In a way many psychopaths are totally unable to plan ahead with such detail as he does. My take on the film is that Louis Bloom actually represents a comic-like stance on modern media and public voyerism about violence. I don't think he is intrinsically more evil than the producer that keeps telling the anchors to repeat ""vicious attack"" and create a crescendo of disgusting drama in their news. I think Bloom just sees through the system with laser-cut eyes and understands the rules of engagement from the get go. He is, in fact a psychopath, and can take these rules of engagement to the very limit without blinking (does he blink during the whole film?). He is just playing by the rules. As the TV channel does. And as the viewers. Everyone using imposted expressions of horror and secretly wishing for a zoomed in shot of a sliced throat gurgling blood.   The film is magnificent at all levels, and has even a go against that BS corporate culture of psychopathy, the culture of popular capitalism where employees are made to believe they can also be successful if they accept the obviously skewed rules companies offer.   In a psychopathic world, psychopaths are just meant to thrive."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,MacintoshEddie,7,Sat Jun 13 21:38:24 2015 UTC,"It would be an amazing detail if he never blinked on-screen for the entirety of the film. Difficult to do, might never be noticed though."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,userreddit,8,Wed Jun 17 09:37:48 2015 UTC,"I found his character interesting because it was played as if he knew what ""people"" were supposed to do, instead of acting that way because of any inherent predisposition towards doing so. He's a psychopath in the truest sense; he has no really connection to anyone. His constant repetition of the mantra about working hard is so insincere - almost everything he says sounds like he's reading a script from some self-help book, because he doesn't have any genuine way of communicating that isn't based on what he has learned is the ""right"" way for people in that situation to act. I never liked him - and I'm a little concerned about the posters here who said they didn't really see what a monster he is until after the film - because literally everything he does is based around singular goals with no concern for the other people involved. It's a terrifying and fascinating point of view to portray; absolutely loved it as a film."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,lordhadri,8,Sun Jun 14 00:53:43 2015 UTC,"It seems like a substantial number of people don't know ""how people are supposed to act"".  I've only been here for a few months, but at any given time on a number of the advice and help subreddits people are asking how they are supposed to act in basic human interactions, or how to manipulate other people.  It's to the point where it's all scripted, even when there are no cameras around.  I think part of it comes down to the old, cliched, and often misinterpreted quote ""If you can't do, teach.""  Some people think that's an insult towards teachers, implying that they are failed authors who teach English, or failed athletes who teach physical education.  The way I see it, natural prodigies make terrible teachers, because so much of what they do is autonomous and unconscious.  Someone who is naturally friendly is going to be a nice person, but an ineffective teacher when it comes it social behavior. They were a nice friendly kid, and then they grew up into a nice friendly adult.  All the students can do in that is mimic them and go out into the world to beta-test what they learned.  A sociopath is the opposite of a social prodigy, they lack the same hardwiring that makes those behaviors unconscious.  As such they're going to be much better teachers because they already beta-tested the scripts.  They have learned through trial and error which scripts work in which situations.  The weird kid becomes the nice young man through learning how to effectively perform scripts.  I don't want to get fitness advice from someone who through genetics and favourable environment has never been anything except healthy and strong.  I want to learn from the person who was a small, weak, sickly child because they are going to have a much more keen understanding of what it is that makes people healthy and strong.  Hopefully that makes some sense.  It seems to make sense to me why some people might not be concerned by the character's lack of humanity."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,SandyRegolith,3,Sun Jun 14 14:00:25 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. I have been theorizing about this topic similarly. Either a person's focus can be on delivering the performance or on understanding the performance. You could argue that a performance can be delivered if you understand the mechanics of it but I feel for a genuinely deep performance, it needs to be far more autonomous and inherent."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,spongemandan,8,Wed Jun 17 10:36:39 2015 UTC,There isn't an evil demon inside of Lou Bloom. He's doing exactly what he was born to do. Bloom is the demon inside of capitalism.
TrueFilm,39qnpz,godvirus,20,Sun Jun 14 02:56:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but I think you're missing the point of the film if you think it's about one man and his actions. The central character is a psychopath/sociopath, but the real target of the film is the American media and the way it shapes the psychology of the TV-watching public.  The media imperatives portrayed in the film are literally true: a story in which a black man kills another black man in a poor part of town don't even go to air. A story in which a black man kills a white man in a nicer part of town is much ""better"" content. The natural result of this is a heightened tension, increased racism, and a general atmosphere of fear. People who see that kind of thing on the news are more likely to be scared, more likely to pull a gun, more likely to prompt another such incident, and so the cycle repeats.  No disrespect to your thoughts on the film, and to Gyllenhaal's amazing performance, but the fact that someone sociopathic is the best person to work in that industry, or that the industry operates sociopathically, without a conscience, is the real message."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,spaceparachute,3,Sun Jun 14 03:22:50 2015 UTC,"Provided that the industry is really fucked up then yes, you're definitely right.  I don't actually know what the industry is like, but whether it's actually a basket case, or just a good setting for Bloom's story, is hard to ascertain."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,Flubby2,4,Sun Jun 14 16:15:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree entirely. Everyone knows what the news is doing. That story has been told a hundred times. This movie isn't particularly revealing in that respect, it's just explicit about it. Lou is what's new and interesting in this film, as you can see in the contrast between him and the seasoned pro he murders. The news angle is common; we've seen it every day for years. But Jake's character is frightening. If it was just about the news we wouldn't need Lou, there were already the guys before him."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,icouldbehigh,2,Sun Jun 28 13:18:58 2015 UTC,"I saw the predatory news-media part as one significant facet of the overall theme: capitalism is exploitation. It's definitely not a revelation, but the news doesn't exist to inform the public; it exists to sell the public to advertisers. In the same way, Lou rises to become more successful the more he exploits others, whether he's underpaying a poor minority, observing and manipulating crime until it can bring him the most cash/power, or blackmailing people.  It's a lot freakier to think about it when it's just one person and he's OK with having to gain power through exploitation. Everyone else is doing it, but they're a bit detached. The camera crews are just trying to stay afloat and make a living, the news team is trying to keep their ratings up, etc. But, they're all getting paid by someone higher up so it's easy (not necessarily correct) to shift the blame away from them. Lou shows us that in order to become one of the higher-ups in capitalist society you have to take from everyone else and don't feel bad about it."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,extremely_average_,-1,Thu Jul 9 18:02:41 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the point of the film    Dude, it's art.   I saw Gilroy talk and he said the movie was about Louis and the nature of capitalism. Yet even his interpretation doesn't matter, cause at the end of the day he's just another audience member (even if he did write and direct it). Artist interpretation does not matter, there's no one interpretation to anything, live and let live etc. etc."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,nonthreat,8,Mon Jun 15 01:40:07 2015 UTC,"a portrayal of this evil demon inside of Louis Bloom that really a lot of us have in us.   The fact that you see Bloom as having a demon inside tells me you're not like him. It's been a while since I saw this movie, but what I got from the movie is that he was a psychopath. These kinds of people, contrary to popular belief are not ""totally crazy"" or have evil inside them. They are just incapable of having any empathy or remorse. That part of their brain is broken, if I may oversimplify the condition. ""Normal"" people looking at psychopaths tend to think there is evil inside them or look for some other explanations because they themselves could never commit these heinous crimes. You might get angry at your neighbor and plot some petty revenge, but you would probably never go as far as Bloom. He is an exaggeration of what we have inside us, and he is believable because there are people exactly like him out there.  Another reason we can identify with bloom is because we know we have the potential to disregard others to get what we want. Just look at the fatpeoplehate shenanigans on reddit on the last few days. I don't believe the people who participated were all evil, horrible people. Some of them might have been caring people who volunteer at charities and such on their spare time. But they may have had a some insecurity, maybe they are a little chubby themselves and hated it, or just hate making space for fat people in scooters at Walmart or a plethora of other reasons that would make them annoyed at fat people. Combine that with all the rhetoric they made to support hating fat people without feeling guilty about the consequences of the outspoken hate and we have a group who lacks empathy for other human beings. So we all know we have to potential to dehumanize and do terrible things to other people without feeling guilty. Some of us might never do that but the potential to be somewhat like bloom is lurking inside of us and we know it. Even if choose not to acknowledged it most of the time.  It's scary to come across that part of ourselves. We all have the potential to be like Bloom, some more than others, but we could be somewhat like Bloom.  There is also the fantasy factor. It's just cool to live through Bloom for a while and see what It'd be like to disregard all people and laws and ethics and go crazy towards a goal. Sort of like Scarface, or a video game like GTA in which you can run over people, kill cops and do all sorts of insane things without any consequences. I'm not saying it's some hidden desire to be immoral and do horrible things, but you (or at least I) can definitely get a kick out a fantasy version of craziness and violence.   Is he the good guy or the bad guy, I really couldn't tell?   I think it's clear he is the bad guy. Bloom has likable qualities--he is disciplined, ambitious, works hard for his dreams, and doesn't let anybody step on his way. These are qualities we  admire in people so it makes us like his character. Had he been just a terrible guy with no redeeming qualities we would have hated him and the movie. But he is still highly immoral and would do anything to get what he wants. This is set up on the first scene with the cop. He seems not to ""get"" that other people exist and have feelings. It seems that this is something that never even crosses his mind. He is utterly focused on his goals and although we can hate him for destroying his competition we can admire his drive. But at the end of the day he has done enough terrible things to be considered a bad guy."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,amoryamory,6,Sat Jun 13 21:49:15 2015 UTC,"I watched last night after so so reviews from my parents. I adore this movie. The pacing was incredible, the movie went by so quick and I never was bored. Your post kind of freaked me out because throughout the movie I never questioned what he was doing. Until it was over it didn't set in that he did all these horrible things. During the big scene when he got Rick shot and kept filming, I didn't question it, I was like ""ya, he's doing his job."" Didn't think that was inside of me. Overall fantastic movie, I would put in my 2014 top three."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,celtic1888,6,Sat Jun 13 22:25:55 2015 UTC,"My absolute favorite part of this film was the ending - when he was successful. He's completed the first part of his journey and he's triumphed. It's very much a similar ending to that of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" -- those smiling, hungry faces who want to enjoy the same success of Leo's character - those people are us! We've watched all of this dreadful excess, and alongside our horror and shock, we feel a dirty sense of envy. Bloom has given us what we want -- drama, brutality and abject violence -- and we're utterly thrilled by it. We want more. And we can count on the very real model of journalism embodied by Bloom's ideals to contintue to offer precisely that. I enjoyed this movie throughout but watching him succeed really did it for me."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,vecthor,4,Sun Jun 14 08:44:42 2015 UTC,I always thought Louis Bloom was also supposed to be sympomatic of modern capitalism. A capitalism where you're completely flexible to be whoever and learn whatever: the only thing stopping you is your own willpower. I think Nightcrawler is supposed to show the dark side of this. He's a person who will not stop to get whatever he wants and has no qualms about ethics whatsoever.  He really is frightening.
TrueFilm,39qnpz,cheyenne04,3,Sun Jun 14 10:37:08 2015 UTC,"I just watched Nightcrawler last night and it did hit a lot of issues that seem to be more and more prevalent in our current society's paradigm:  'Morals be damned if you are successful'    It seems we have de-evolved into thinking that amoral behavior is ok as long as it brings success. Obviously this brings into play which side of the nihilism fence you stand on but we have definitely moved from a collective good taking a back seat to the individual's benefit.  The 'making' of Bloom was a very interesting concept. He's obviously a sociopath (even admits to it) and has no friends or family despite having grown up in the area. He's intelligent and has self-taught himself skills via the internet. Having no innate moral compass but with full access to knowledge it's pretty apparent no one ever challenged Bloom's outlook. He is now armed with knowing how to present himself and how to say all the 'right' things the situation dictates but lacks (or ignores) any bit of empathy. He's the poster child for Rand's Objectivism and manages to find someone desperate enough and ambitious enough to further exploit his sociopathic traits.   Yellow journalism, white flight terror, etc have been with us for a lot of years now. With the internet and the ability to surround ourselves into virtual echo chambers of thought produce many more Blooms or are sociopathic tendencies limited via the population and you are always going to have 7-12% population acting in a predatory nature?"
TrueFilm,39qnpz,mojoSOdopes,6,Sun Jun 14 22:40:37 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite part of this film is when Lou alters the car crash so he could get a better shot and there's a upbeat music playing while he does that. It feels like the director wants the audience to cheer for Lou's psychopathic behaviors. I admit that that's wrong, but I totally cheered for Lou. I guess the only reason Lou could be so successful in this business is because he knew that people are morbidly curious."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,happybadger,5,Sun Jun 14 02:23:22 2015 UTC,"Don't want to come across like a dick but this discussion has been done to death in r/movies. Ideally truefilm would go slightly beyond ""Isn't Lou Bloom an interesting character?"" and ""Jake Gyllenhaal is so creepy!"""
TrueFilm,39qnpz,WildlifeAnalysis,13,Sat Jun 13 21:45:53 2015 UTC,"I think they're taking it beyond that by not only saying ""isn't he interesting,"" but also  ""he reminded me of an evil we all have living within us to a certain extent, and perhaps his character is more universally recognizable than many of us are comfortable with"" etc."

It's a character archetype that has a huge amount of dramatic potential and some interesting examples in recent years. For a long time socio/psychopathy was only really portrayed in slasher flicks with all the depth of a Schwarzenegger character. Even as far up as Silence of the Lambs it was more of a ""LOL ISN'T HE SPOOKY"" gimmick than something explored seriously, and as great as American Psycho is both the book and film are over-the-top satires.   Corporate media commentary has been discussed to death, but a well-written and well-acted character with an interesting contribution to an archetype stands on their own and warrants talking about."
TrueFilm,39qnpz,WildlifeAnalysis,2,Sun Jun 14 06:41:12 2015 UTC,"Nightcrawler upset me a bit because I've had bad experiences with a sociopath in real life. It's the same reason I couldn't enjoy The Social Network. The films hit too close to home for me.   Also, I couldn't really tell what message Nightcrawler was trying to get across. The film was definitely portraying the main character as a bad person, but he never got his comeuppance in the end. Is the message of the film that sociopaths suck, but there's nothing anyone can do about them? That's a pretty depressing thought."
TrueFilm,39r2xk,NoeticIntelligence,5,Sat Jun 13 22:48:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of Kitano's. You're half right about his acting; he was in a motorcycle accident and was partially paralyzed, and didn't quite get control of all of his facial muscles back after. He's a little more expressive in films he made prior, though the spareness of his style still calls much for subtle performance.  I highly recommend Violent Cop, Sonatine, and Kids Return."

TrueFilm,39q1wo,sartre121,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:20:30 2015 UTC,"Oppenheimer's features are self-consciously made in a way that will make them be taken seriously as cinematic art. I think they pass the test of personal expression but as a result don't necessarily depict realistic, factual truths. That's impossible to do anyway because the documentary filmmaker will always insert themselves to make an argument and indeed that's what's good about the best docs. The problem I have with The Act of Killing is that so many responses to it seemed to be projection by western critics onto a situation that couldn't be understood from one movie, so I can't reconcile that with a viewing of the movie as being factual. But, it's not like The Act of Killing and The Look of Silence are unaware that they're fictionalized, because the whole conceit of The Act of Killing is that you see people making a movie about themselves instead of just telling you who they are. I suppose it succeeds in the sense that it demystifies mass murderers and makes genocide look like more than historical statistics."
TrueFilm,39q1wo,lordhadri,3,Sat Jun 13 17:34:28 2015 UTC,"Criticiscing a documentary because it lacks objectivity or because its subject matter is too complex for one film seems to be pretty redundant though, hadri (especially due to the fact he has shot enough footage to make two films from two wildly different viewpoints). How else are critics supposed to analyse it? We could posit the same argument for every documentary that attempts to tackle difficult, large-scale subjects from a largely objective perspective. They will not succeed and I think that Oppenheimer knows this, hence why he hands over the reigns to the deplorable subjects themselves; if you can't make a documentary as factual as possible then make it as expressive as you can and mix the subjective truth in with it, which is exactly where the demystification comes from. As you pointed out, if this were nothing more than a historical catalogue then it would lose any purpose and impact and the demystification of the subject would never happen."
TrueFilm,39q1wo,hydra815,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:08:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think the cinematic aestheticization of the movies were really necessary to achieve those ideas though, even if they did succeed in making them pretty. Would non-Indonesians have noticed it if it hadn't done this?   Basically I think both movies will convince you of what you already believe or want to believe. The Look of Silence is better because at least that argument comes from the main character. Would love to hear a third opinion though."

TrueFilm,39p0fo,FaerieStories,21,Sat Jun 13 10:45:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like anything visual can be described as imagery, but the word is typically used in contexts where it's particularly evocative, striking, or effective.  Who bothers to talk about bland, unassuming, and unmemorable imagery, unless to criticize it as such? Simple shots that do their job are one thing, but if a moment is particularly carried by the visuals, then the visuals are worth discussing.  The literary examples you posted are great because the feeling and mood of the moment are particularly carried by the imagery they place in your head.  But there are lots of elements of a film that are obviously not imagery, dialogue for one, sound design for another, and you can see where I'm going with that."
TrueFilm,39p0fo,jzakko,4,Sat Jun 13 10:56:56 2015 UTC,"Right, but what I'm getting at is what is the difference between 'imagery' and 'visuals'?   But there are lots of elements of a film that are obviously not imagery, dialogue for one, sound design for another   I know: this is why I said ""visually speaking""."
TrueFilm,39p0fo,jzakko,16,Sat Jun 13 10:59:13 2015 UTC,"The point I'm making is that there is no real difference, but typically you see people use the word imagery when whatever emotion or point of a scene or whatever is particularly and evocatively carried by those visuals.  When the visuals are the dominant element in what makes it work.  People are going to talk about the imagery of 2001 or PlayTime and so on a lot more than other films for that reason."
TrueFilm,39p0fo,vee_lan_cleef,7,Sat Jun 13 11:45:04 2015 UTC,"There really isn't much of a difference beyond semantics, but if you want one, imagery can be described as what you see in your mind, and visuals are what you see on the screen. It's not a rule. Any visual in a film can evoke imagery, but sometimes visuals are designed to evoke more specific imagery, in the same way a writer uses different words to manipulate the reader.  Just like you say... in a book, some things are explanatory and others more descriptive. Some shots are just there to explain something.  Since this is a movie it is done visually, that doesn't mean it's designed to evoke some other feeling or image, but it might anyway."
TrueFilm,39p0fo,strangenchanted,4,Sat Jun 13 11:47:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with the others that the difference between 'imagery' and 'visuals' is minimal. I'd say that the key is, visuals are anything captured by the camera. You can just point the camera at a blank wall or grass growing, and you'll get visuals.  Imagery connotes visuals that are not merely captured, but rendered. They are composed, framed, perhaps styled and/or stylized. They convey more than what is simply presented. Oftentimes, they express the style or sensibility of the director or cinematographer. Or tie into the film's themes. Or hint at the unseen inner workings of the characters. When people discuss imagery, they are likely to be talking about artistic choices, not simply what is presented onscreen."
TrueFilm,39p0fo,strangenchanted,4,Sat Jun 13 13:46:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation, but I'm still finding this whole concept of imagery dissatisfying (not through your fault: I think you've explained it well).  If you think about a good film (for example Blade Runner - my favourite) there isn't a single shot that isn't laden with significance which tells us something deeper about theme, character or authorial intention. Every visual element of Blade Runner is imagery.  But I'm not sure 'quality' should be the thing to differentiate between 'visuals' and 'imagery'. Is it even possible to point a camera at something and there not be some kind of deeper meaning behind it? Even - for example - the blandest of Michael Bay films shot for efficiency rather than artistry are still just shot after shot of things which tell us something about character or theme or setting or narrative. If you imagine the most boring, utilitarian establishing shot designed to show what city the story takes place in, even that is still there for a deliberate reason for the benefit of the movie as a whole (namely: to imply that this is where the story takes place). Such a shot cannot be taken at face value: audiences know to recognise it as an establishing shot which sets the scene rather than an unrelated shot of a city for no clear reason.  Imagery just seems like a term too tenuous to even be worth using in the context of film."
TrueFilm,39p0fo,strangenchanted,5,Sat Jun 13 14:01:11 2015 UTC,"Might be you're overthinking it a little. Even technical, ""utilitarian"" shots are artistic choices. Let's use the term visual craft here. Visual craft permeates everything in filmmaking.  Imagery can be thought of as simply visual craft at a high level. When people bring up ""imagery"" in discussing a film, they are selectively picking out impressive sequences of visual craft.  Compare this to acting. Actors act throughout the course of the film, but people tend to focus on specific, memorable scenes of acting.  ""Imagery"" is kind of a tenuous term, but it's too useful to discard. People generally understand what it means when it's brought up, even if they can't quite break it down into easily analyzable concepts. And I think that's fine. We're talking art here. It's always gonna be somewhat loosey-goosey."

Actors act throughout the course of the film, but people tend to focus on specific, memorable scenes of acting.   Sure. But we don't really have a term which differentiates between good and bad acting. I mean, we have synonyms for 'good' and 'bad' obviously, but we don't treat good acting as a categorically different sort of thing to bad or mediocre acting. It's all just acting. And rightly so I think.   ""Imagery"" is kind of a tenuous term, but it's too useful to discard   Can you explain what you mean? If I were to say, for example, ""the imagery of Kurtz' bald head in the darkness"", why would that be any different to ""the visual depiction of Kurtz' bald head in the darkness""?  And yes, lots of artistic terms are tenuous, but most are necessary. 'Art' is a tenuous term, yet still necessary, as we have no other term for this aspect of human experience. I can't see a reason why 'imagery' (in film) needs to exist as a term, when we can talk about what is visually there in each shot without needing to call it 'imagery'."

The term imagery is shorthand for something that would take paragraphs to explain, which generally doesn't need explaining, because people get what it means, somehow. That's not very precise. But language isn't precise. It's a living, organic thing, shaped by culture and personal history, and everchanging. It's still useful. Imprecise terms can be useful. Maybe not necessary.

TrueFilm,39p0fo,Ronald0912,5,Sat Jun 13 15:26:26 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the term ""imagery"" applied to a single shot or a single element of a film, as in your Kurtz example. In all the instances I've seen, ""imagery"" means the use of visual images in a certain way, and not necessarily recurring (for example, I can talk about the imagery in After life, without necessarily pointing to recurring elements; there is a clear visual quality to the film that doesn't reside in repetition).   Interpreting imagery as just the presence of visual images makes it a tautological concept in the realm of cinema: in that sense, all film is imagery. It's not a useful meaning in this context. But when you read about some film's or filmmaker's imagery you are always (or almost always, since evidently there are incorrect uses) reading about the specific way they use visual elements (color, composition, motifs).  There is also the literary meaning of ""imagery"". I don't think your definition encompasses its whole meaning. ""Imagery"" in literature also corresponds to the use of certain symbolic shortcuts and in this sense it is also used in cinema, as with the example that you give of animals in Blade runner. In this sense, Pan's Labyrinth includes mythological/fantastic creatures and settings as part of its imagery, not only visual elements such as color. We say it draws from the imagery of myth."
TrueFilm,39p0fo,Ronald0912,3,Sat Jun 13 15:30:48 2015 UTC,"This is a great question, and essentially philosophical. Most responses have tried to find the distinction in the intention of the artist, and I am going to piggy-back off of that. Namely, that when a particular shot is meant to convey something which is more than simply what is seen, you have imagery. When it is meant to simply communicate a necessary fact, or simply for eye candy, you have visuals. (Personally, I think visuals should cover both of these terms and we should then further break it down between imagery and a different word for the latter one, but I digress.)  Now, you cited a Michael Bay film and claimed that every one of his shots could be described as imagery because there is still purpose in them. I think this is haphazard. The distinction is not between shots that have a purpose and those that don't, it's between shots in which the purpose is meant to communicate something more than what we see and shots in which the purpose is simply to explain/dress up what we see. I don't think Bay would say something like ""this particular explosion symbolizes the fiery struggle within the heart of the protaganist, eventually culminating in an uncontrollable outburst which injures all those around him.""  You then mentioned Blade Runner. Every shot is ladened with meaning. But, the very fact that you noticed this indicates that you realize there is more to a shot than to simply communicate brute facts. Now, would a director that shows an aerial view of the city in which his story takes place say the shot is ""ladened"" with meaning in the same way? Probably not.  Sure, both of these kinds of shots have meaning, they have purpose. But the differences lies in the nature of that purpose. Maybe you're right in that these terms are a bit vague and inadequate. But, if we are to talk about the difference between a shot in which the only purpose is to tell you the setting, and a shot in which the purpose is to illuminate the underlying theme/idea of the film, we need some terminology to do this.  P.S. To illustrate this difference, there was a funny pic a while back from a scene in Breaking Bad where someone mockingly decided to find purpose in every single item on the screen. It was a critique of trying to find imagery where there are simply visuals (possibly)."
TrueFilm,39p0fo,Ronald0912,2,Sun Jun 14 04:35:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think Bay would say something like ""this particular explosion symbolizes the fiery struggle within the heart of the protaganist, eventually culminating in an uncontrollable outburst which injures all those around him.""   No, but then again: why should we care what Bay thinks? The artist doesn't have a monopoly on the interpretation of his own work. In any case, whereas obviously most people wouldn't interpret Michael Bay films in the way you describe, you can always describe even an explosion as ""something more than what we see"". I mean: if a building explodes, it's always much more than just a building exploding. It's also what is unseen: namely our knowledge or predictions about who might be in the building; who the explosion might affect; who might have set off the explosion. There is always another layer.   And yet, on the other hand, you have films from far more competent directors who love cinematography and so do make shots which are there purely for the beauty of their composition: the visual pleasure of seeing them (""eye candy"", as you put it). And by your definition, these shots wouldn't be called 'imagery', yet everyone would call them that.   Now, would a director that shows an aerial view of the city in which his story takes place say the shot is ""ladened"" with meaning in the same way?    Your definition was that imagery was when a visual element was ""something which is more than simply what is seen"" - not ""something laden with meaning"". And again: it doesn't matter what the director thinks.   But, if we are to talk about the difference between a shot in which the only purpose is to tell you the setting, and a shot in which the purpose is to illuminate the underlying theme/idea of the film, we need some terminology to do this.   Then you need to adjust your definition to ""imagery is any shot which illustrates thematic rather than expository detail"". This is a better distinction I think, though still dissatisfying, since - again - I can think of plenty of shots which would be called ""imagery"" and yet be distinct from the film's themes. Besides, every shot can be linked to the film's themes, since we derive the themes from the shots - not vice versa.   P.S. To illustrate this difference, there was a funny pic a while back from a scene in Breaking Bad where someone mockingly decided to find purpose in every single item on the screen. It was a critique of trying to find imagery where there are simply visuals (possibly).   That picture was trying to find symbolism in a shot where things would be best interpreted as purely literal. Imagery is not purely about symbolism/metaphor. Imagery can be figurative or it can be literal."
TrueFilm,39p0fo,RyanSmallwood,2,Sun Jun 14 07:53:59 2015 UTC,"In regards to the meaning of a shot, it would be hard to argue that the artist's intention is not primary. This isn't like some painter splashing colors on a canvas and saying ""it means whatever you want it to mean."" As you put it in regards to Blade Runner, the artist obviously has more in mind than simply to fill space on a screen. It is ""ladened"" with meaning. You don't get to arbitrarily decide what a shot means, the artist is telling you what it means.  I think common sense is helpful here. Take any shot that is so filled with meaning from Blade Runner, then one of those chaotic shots from a Transformer's film. Are you saying that they both have the same degree of depth/meaning/purpose? That just seems wrong. Sure, they both have a purpose. But there are varying degrees of meaning to a shot, some more than others. I don't think an explosion has the same degree of meaning as a shot which serves to illuminate the nature of the protagonist. Surely you can agree with this?  I have no loyalty to the terms we use to describe this. But I am arguing that not all shots are equal in purpose/meaning/depth, and using different words to distinguish them is helpful."
TrueFilm,39p0fo,RyanSmallwood,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:44:29 2015 UTC,"In regards to the meaning of a shot, it would be hard to argue that the artist's intention is not primary.   Not at all. In fact, it's the most dominant school of thought in fiction criticism at the moment. Most people don't go as far as Roland Barthes (who argued that the author figure is completely irrelevant when studying a text: only the reader matters), but as a whole most critics, scholars, teachers and professors of fiction know that the subjective nature of fictional criticism means that what you take from a work of art is the most important thing.   ou don't get to arbitrarily decide what a shot means, the artist is telling you what it means.   No-one is ""arbitrarily"" doing anything. We interpret what something means to us, because what fiction means to us is really the only measure we can have of its quality. It's subjective. The artist's intention is certainly interesting to note, and can inform our own opinions, but at the end of the day it is our own subjective impression that is key. Ridley Scott says Deckard is a replicant. Harrison Ford says he isn't. Who is right? The answer is neither. Fiction is not about 'right' and 'wrong'. The viewer must decide for themselves.   Are you saying that they both have the same degree of depth/meaning/purpose? That just seems wrong. Sure, they both have a purpose. But there are varying degrees of meaning to a shot, some more than others. I don't think an explosion has the same degree of meaning as a shot which serves to illuminate the nature of the protagonist. Surely you can agree with this?   I agree with this, but yet I don't really see how a term like ""imagery"" is helpful here when we can't seem to pin down the exact criteria of what constitutes an ""image"" rather than simply a ""visual"". If it's simply a term to indicate the quality, complexity or depth of a shot, as you indicate, then why is it necessary to treat it as this categorically different thing? A bland shot from Transformers and a fantastic shot from Blade Runner aren't different things: they're just two shots: one of which we deem to be good/beautiful/meaningful and the other less so. Why do they need to be categorised as distinctly different things, and how specifically are we determining this categorisation?"

The narrative in his films are more complex and tackles more mature themes in comparison to Miyazaki. Though, I guess Picasso's quote about drawing like a child could be used for Miyazaki. Takahata's films have a wisdom within them that makes them very rewatchable since he concerns himself a lot with life and ones purpose within society.   It's such a shame he didn't win the oscars, because Princess Kaguya was a clear evidence of a master at work. I find that he perfected his art since Only Yesterday and has been experimenting ever since.  With that said, Miyazaki is still my favorite. I'm just a sucker for his films."

Takahata's films are poetically inspired on Japanese tradition and values, hence why you could read Graves as a criticism of modern individuals and you see the city in Only Yesterday as an alienating zone leaving the modern Japanese citizen feeling out of place, living as though they're following the wrong path.   His films have been criticized as conservative (not exactly my cup of tea), but I still think that he was the far more interesting director at Ghibli worthy of respect."

We are free of the external skeleton, the shackles, but is there more to the wind blowing and the plants growing?  There was another time in human history that the exoskeleton of religion was collapsed. And it was done in protest.  It was in response to the Pope and the Crusades. it was intelligent, well trained, smart individuals - who decided that serving a power-oriented (map-focused) Pope was corrupt and did not serve Love and Compassion.  Year 1210 Southern France. One identifiable artist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_von_Strassburg  -- but really it was open source.  Tristan was a knight character, and the open source writers collaborated.  Think of campfire stories where people use a character and tell their own story.  But some focused on the ideal that the Church was shit. That religion was corrupt. And that they needed to protest.      New York Professor Joseph Campbell at age 82: ""In a wasteland, people are fulfilling purposes that are not properly theirs but have been put upon them as inescapable laws. This is a killer. The twelfth-century troubadour poetry of courtly love was a protest against this supernaturally justified violation of life's joy in truth. So too the Tristan legend and at least one of the great versions of the legend of the Grail, that of Wolfram von Eschenbach. The spirit is really the bouquet of life. It is not something breathed into life, it comes out of life.""      And here you have, Only Yesterday - that picks up the baton.  Isao Takahata (and writers), outsiders to Troubadour Europe - who understands precisely what is wrong (missing ingredient) with our modern wasteland choice marriages.  Gone Girl (USA), Three Colors: White (Paris) and A Separation (Iran) show the silhouette absence of Troubadour AMOR Love.  It is in fact, Only Yesterday that show the affirmation.  The childhood spirit born into adulthood -the inward path to Love.  The proven, established and well paved, path of marriage is circumstances. Money, wealth, parents, children, punishment, laws, licenses.  But here you have a story Only Yesterday that talks of the inward path, of learning and listening.  Meditation and consideration.  This is a modern telling of Troubadour AMOR.  It goes far beyond film, impacting every male and female in the world.  If people choose to listen... the art speaks."

You made wide-reaching and unsupported generalizations about life, art, religion, marriage, and film; and it isn't even clear what kind of connections you are trying to establish."
TrueFilm,39kvc9,Vermilion,-2,Sat Jun 13 05:40:30 2015 UTC,"It being unclear is neither my fault nor  Isao Takahata's.  People wanting to misunderstand things that are important, like war, isn't new at all.  People want to fight wars - they only say they don't like them, then pick up or fund the guns again.  Be it marriage in Only Yesterday or Graves of the Fireflies.  People on reddit do it constantly too."
TrueFilm,39kvc9,Vermilion,2,Sat Jun 13 13:28:40 2015 UTC,"I got a bit lost in this whole thing.    t seems society critics spoke up and created weddings and ""no intercourse without the promise"" education   That doesn't seem remotely true. Arranged weddings were par for course during Roman Catholic times, nothing to do with children, and previous to that Polygamy or  general open relationships were the norm. Marriage still happened as a legal set work, but sex (children) were not really related to it.    Only Yesterday that talks of the inward path, of learning and listening. Meditation and consideration   Well put, that is certainly true. I think you went a bit overboard on some of the marriage stuff, but if that is your specialty then go for it. :)  I might argue that Gone Girl is actually about the entrapment of marriage and how it only makes problems worse versues a community built on trust and free from restriction. But thats a whole other can of worms."
TrueFilm,39kvc9,Vermilion,-7,Sat Jun 13 06:44:47 2015 UTC,"That doesn't seem remotely true. Arranged weddings were par for course during Roman Catholic times, nothing to do with children,   Look: I started off by saying the entire global, earth.  Roman Catholic doesn't exist in all periods of history on earth.  The Bible was not used in India.  Marriage does.  I mentioned Navajo.  We are talking about a film in Japan, the geography and history of the geographic separation is important.  Choice marriage did not exist in the same way and same ideals.  I will repeat: I think marriage was created because pregnancy happened and men didn't take responsibility.  Otherwise you can just be like most other mammals, have sex, and do what you wish.  Marriage was an education system from the elders to teach the youth about commitment.  It's an idea system, first and foremost, an education.   I think you went a bit overboard on some of the marriage stuff   If you would study Troubadour teaching, you would gain an understanding that there is no such thing as overboard.  It's a misunderstanding to even claim it's possible to ""go overboard"".  Disagreeing without understanding is the path pepole take on this.  Wedding vows are ignored, not understood.  People just claim 'oops, I forgot, I did not really mean that nonsense'.  Essentially your reply here on reddit is to just throw it away, discard it, extrude it.  It's not a surprise to me to have that reaction.  But it is not understanding.  It's just disagreement.  People can disagree without understanding."
TrueFilm,39kvc9,Vermilion,2,Sat Jun 13 13:18:52 2015 UTC,"I mean, sure, there is possibly a marriage in the implied epilogue of Only Yesterday, but I think if you were going to write a dissertation on that film it'd be more prudent to focus on the overarching themes of masking one's pain through a cheery disposition and the weight seemingly insignificant childhood events have on the future adult."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,zappymax,101,Fri Jun 12 06:20:44 2015 UTC,"I was going over the /r/movies discussion for this and was shocked that it was so positive, and that the ratings were so high. Even though I'm a pretty big fan of the series, I had pretty low expectations from the initial trailers, but they didn't even meet those.  First off, the worst part of this movie was the writing. All of the human characters were unlikable or forgettable cliches. The script was basically of bunch of cheesy groan inducing one liners, awkwardly stitched together. The actors were alright, it's really impressive to me that Chris Pratt did so well with the shitty script he was given, so props to him. Both of the kid characters were stupid, the little kid was just cringeworthy, I get that he was supposed to be a kid genius but it's just annoying to hear him spout out facts that have little relevance to the plot (how would he know the make and model of the jeep, and why should we care?), and the brother was a typical ""lol teenagers are antisocial and obsessed with technology"", I don't even remember their names.  I could spend the whole post talking about the stupid nit-picky details in this film (How did Pratt's character get his motorcycle to the raptor pen? How did the two kids fix a car that has been rotting in the jungle for 20 years to run in five minutes with no tools and no gas?) but instead I'll just go over the main parts that I thought were stupid, and the parts I liked.  This movie was bad but there were some redeeming qualities. I thought that the main conflict in the set up of the film has sort of interesting. The fact that the general public didn't really care about dinosaurs after the park had been open for so long was a neat mirror to general audience's getting used to cgi, which was such a big selling point in the original JP. I enjoyed some of the small references and ""easter eggs"", Mr. DNA, Jimmy Fallon, the guy running with the margaritas from the pterodactyls who I think I read was jimmy buffet? Also the final fight scene was kind of cool, and the main dinosaur villain had cool send off.  Now onto the negative stuff. This movie had some glaring issues with the plot. The biggest one that baffled me was why would the fact that the dino was part raptor be classified? They all knew that it was part T-rex, why would it they try to keep the raptor part a secret? And the whole alpha dynamic with the raptors was stupid. The big one growls at them and they immediately become friendly with him? And then Pratt touches one of their faces and they go back to fighting with Pratt? And if the cuddlefish-asaurus was part t-rex, why didn't he try to talk to him? Why was everyone upset that the private military of ingen was stepping in? If I knew that there were a bunch of trained raptors and genetically modified killer dinosaur were loose I would be kissing the feet of those mercenaries.  This movie was basically the original JP with all the tension removed. They tried to make this movie a blockbuster dinosaur fighting movie, but their are already movies from recent years that do it much better,. All of the fighting had no buildup, the only characters I cared about were the raptors and they got wiped out almost instantly at the beginning of the fight. So yeah, definitely dissapointing, at least it was hilariously bad at a lot of points so the bad movie lover in me got a kick out of that."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,KBrot,31,Fri Jun 12 08:36:19 2015 UTC,"I was also blown away by the almost universal (ha!) adulation for this movie. If you like it, you like it and that's fine. But everyone on /r/movies?! It can't just be nostalgia driving that. I consider myself one of the biggest JP fans in the world and nostalgia didn't save JW from mediocrity for me. My unfortunate hope is that the movie is sort of self-fulfilling and these exuberant redditors are the youngins who just want Marvel's Transformers with dinosaurs, which is what this was.  The one thing form your writing that I'll defend is the T-Rex and I-Rex not hooking up. I was thinking that as I left the theater. Generally in the JP universe, the T-Rex isn't terribly communicative so it probably wouldn't converse with the I-Rex, even sharing its genes. There's the parent-child thing in Lost World but... Yeah, well, I was able to get past that point."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,zappymax,17,Fri Jun 12 08:51:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought about it after posting and remembered that t-rexes aren't really pack animals. And yeah, I'm not one to scream ""/r/HailCorporate!!"" but there was something super fishy about how positive everyone is about the movie. Pretty much every male from my high school graduating class was at the midnight showing and we all, in unison, began talking about how awful the movie was. Seriously, out of the 30 or so people there, One person said he kinda liked it, and another one was arguing that the movie was okay just because he likes to argue and play devil's advocate. I don't know, it's probably not some corporate conspiracy and general audiences just want to see computer generated dinosaurs fight each other."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,KBrot,21,Fri Jun 12 08:56:49 2015 UTC,"general audiences just want to see computer generated dinosaurs fight each other.   And honestly? I'd have been okay with that. I morphed back into a five-year-old for that ending fight. But the movie was so uneven tonally, I could barely enjoy even the pure action moments throughout most of it."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,zappymax,11,Fri Jun 12 09:03:06 2015 UTC,Yeah the god awful dialogue and script just so took me out of the movie that by the time the final fight rolled around I just didn't care anymore.
TrueFilm,39jwc1,DuoJetOzzy,9,Fri Jun 12 09:07:31 2015 UTC,"The ending sequence was going fine until the Raptor/Rex tag-team action. I can handle a bit of ridiculousness, but that crossed the line."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,KBrot,10,Fri Jun 12 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"I've reconciled the tag-team fighting. I'm not sure I'm okay with the bro nods the dinos gave each other plus the bro nod from raptor to Owen. That's completely out of character for Rexy and especially for the raptor, who nearly ate Owen in the first scene before he rolls under the gate."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,DuoJetOzzy,11,Fri Jun 12 18:55:41 2015 UTC,"I just can't handle the raptor piggybacking off the T-Rex. Pretty awesome in a way, but so, so ridiculous I was laughing. The bro nods were just weird. I was half expecting form them to walk away in slow-mo as the Mossasaurus exploded in the background.  And yeah, the raptor allegiance jumping made no sense."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Limond,3,Fri Jun 12 19:02:34 2015 UTC,"I did enjoy the scene when T-Rex joins the fray in the final fight. However  they completely throw out everything the other films showed us about raptors. The raptors are shown as simple minded by jumping on the back of the I-Rex and biting its back. That is literally all they did. No attacking from all sides, no razor sharp talons slashing at I-Rex. They were only a distraction to be easily swatted aside instead of the fearless, intelligent killing machines we saw in the other films."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,IAmLuckyDuckling,16,Sun Jun 14 22:18:25 2015 UTC,"I think I'll vote with my dollars on this one. I'd rather if Hollywood was going to finance sequels to decades-old films, they all be well-written like Mad Max: Fury Road. Jurassic World looks terrible."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,chibro2,8,Sat Jun 13 01:45:53 2015 UTC,"I fear the above average reviews and huge box office means they'll finance more design-by-committee sequels with bland action and poor characters. That's kind of the problem with this franchise, the last two sequels are by no means good, but they're not Batman & Robin level bad in terms of reviews and returns. Honestly part of me was rooting for this movie to flop so we get a reboot (or something similar in spirit) that takes some risk and have one iota of style."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,theorymeltfool,3,Sat Jun 13 22:45:48 2015 UTC,"Well, they've already been doing that. JW isn't the first, there's already been a long line of poorly made yet financially successful reboots, sequels, etc."

TrueFilm,39jwc1,otherpeoplesmusic,5,Fri Jun 19 05:42:40 2015 UTC,"Well, first and foremost, I find car chases boring and monotonous - the worst part of many, many action films. Sometimes they're good because they're done in interesting ways and are short and concise. In this film, the whole thing was one long boring ride.   I hated how the brides were introduced, clad in basically bikinis being hosed down like it was a swimwear commercial.   Max's 'struggles' were meaningless, to me, and I felt no connection with him nor Therons character. The build up to the green place was so poorly done, I didn't even care when she had her breakdown moment. The weird use of string music with heavy guitars was tonally incoherent, and many times felt like it was trying to force an emotional response, a typical hollywood trick which I find manipulative and downright condescending.   The spectacle was 'not my thing'. I live in Australia. Big cars and shitty music is the bane of my existence, so it does nothing for me.   In comparison with Road Warrior, which had some personality and a simpleness I can respect even though I don't like it, was completely stripped down and replaced with spectacle and no character. The designs of the villains looked like shit, like an idiots idea of what cool is.   The beauty of the desert didn't match the apocalyptic theme - the landscapes were stunning, the colours majestic.... it was, again, tonally incoherent.   Not a single death mattered. I particularly remember when one of the brides gets run over after being thrown off the truck, and I didn't care, at all, because she had no personality, no character arc, she was just a Mcguffin, really, and her death meant nothing. Too many characters were like this.   Nux's transition from bad to good was poorly handled, and poorly explained (totally unbelievable, to me) and that was the best thing the film did, in my eyes.   Then to top it off, they decide to ride into the desert and die like fools until Max somehow catches up to them and convinces them to go back, completely undermining Therons character and turning her, and the granny bikers, into bumbling idiots."

TrueFilm,39jwc1,zappymax,6,Sat Jun 13 05:51:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words :). I still use /r/movies for news on new releases, trailers and such, but the comments and critique on this subreddit is much better. As reddit has gotten larger in my time here, it has become increasingly apparent that it more geared towards general audiences. I remember a few years ago, when I first joined, there were at least a few people who knew a lot more about film and could recommend more obscure artsy films, but it seems that those people moved on to smaller subs or different sites sometime after the sub passed a millions subscribers. Plus nobody here really fits the stereotypical snobby art film lover, people here can appreciate film as art and learn about more obscure films while still enjoying a good popcorn flick. Oh and the mods here also try to expose lesser known artists (when the /r/movies mods tried to do the same thing a bunch posts popped up talking about how they didn't want learn about ""stupid pretentious 'art' filmmakers' lol). Enjoy your stay!"
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Darchseraph,16,Sat Jun 13 06:47:50 2015 UTC,"The thing is, you really can't think too hard about these movie plots.  I and I assume many people in /r/movies went in expecting an action filled Dino flick and that's what we got at the end. Sure the buildup could have been better, less cheesy,etc. The Villain could have been less two dimensional and  Park security could have been not friggin idiots when they drew up the security protocols but that's not the point.  If you want to logical response they should have had some PMC soldiers on standby with modern Anti-Tank weaponry and training ready to deploy in case of a critical containment failure such as a large angry Rex hybrid getting lose... you know, instead of jokers with stun guns. But if they did we wouldn't have much of a story since the I-Rex would have been put down as soon as it got out.  Will I be eager to re-watch this anytime soon? No, but imo it was quite fun to watch and that's what counts for me. 7/10 for me."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,blob_face,13,Fri Jun 12 22:03:50 2015 UTC,"It's not the imperfect premise that bothered me as much as the characters. I just didn't care about any of them. It's okay that they're silly cliches, but they could have at least done something with those cliches. They could have subverted our expectations just a little bit. Once you hear the first line out of any character's mouth, you know what their role in the entire movie is going to be. Other than death, the whole experience has no effect on any of the characters. They're only there to sit through the ride. The divorce and romantic subplots felt like last ditch attempts to try and fix that, but they failed. I ended up tolerating the movie during its runtime because of the dinosaurs, but it could have been great instead of merely watchable.    I also wish, with how incompetent everyone was throughout the movie, that they would at least play it up for laughs. The movie was self-aware at some moments (""nobody cares about regular dinosaurs anymore"", Pratt criticising the hybrid, making fun of product placement, the failed kiss), but not nearly enough for the characters' nonsensical decisions throughout the entire movie to be forgiven."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,AlbertHummus,15,Sun Jun 14 07:20:04 2015 UTC,"What I loved about the first movie was that almost every character was memorable. You had ""spared no expense"" John Hammond, ""woman inherits Earth"" Laura Dern, chaos theory Jeff Goldblum, you had Sam Neil schooling a kid on how scary raptors actually are. In this movie, the characterizations are all circumstantial instead of being reflected through their personality. What's up with the older kid and chicks staring at him? What was the point of that?"
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Vagrantwalrus,2,Sun Jun 14 07:52:40 2015 UTC,"I think the older kid was one of the few people in the movie who actually had somewhat of an arc. I perceived the staring stuff early in the movie as a way to reinforce the ""Asshole Teenager"" cliche, which payed off nicely later when he actually started looking out for his brother. I also think it was probably a joke that fell flat..."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Limond,5,Wed Jun 17 22:39:16 2015 UTC,"Or maybe something like two stage security around each pen. Build one wall that the dino tests itself against. Eventually it breaks free. Oh no!

Compare that to the first Jurassic Park where there was so much build up to actually seeing the dinosaurs, and the scenes of their killing spree were much more drawn out and elegant."

TrueFilm,39jwc1,KBrot,67,Sat Jul 11 07:02:23 2015 UTC,"Wow that was stupid.   To begin with, it's not trying to be Jurassic Park. It's much dumber, much more loud, trying to be a wise cracking, action set piece centered modern blockbuster. That is okay. I love those when they're done right. But Holy lord was this script a cluster fuck.   The very basics of the plot were pretty alright in my opinion. The whole thing about dinosaurs being commonplace, pressure on the Park to constantly look for new attractions to keep interest, it works very well. Could have made a great movie.   The dialogue was so fucking stupid it took me out of the movie every single time. Chris Pratt did a great job with what he was given, but what he was given was atrocious. ""We've got to stick together... For survival"".   It was very, very obvious the script had gone through numerous rewrites and was a bandaged, duck taped together travesty of a story. Didn't care about any of the characters, no time spent developing the kids (they go from ""He's so mean to him"" to ""We're brothers, we'll always be brothers"" in a few scenes starring them).   No closure or structural continuity at all. What happens to those embryos now? Who's even in charge? What's the fallout of this incident on the park? Nope, all you get is a scene of a T Rex roaring while overlooking the park.   The action was alright, really liked the Indominous being a predator scenes. Wish Brian Tee was in it more. The climax did not work at all, it's like they riffed a scene using 'and then' and just decided to shoot it as is. ""Then the big sea monster eats him!""   I'm mainly disappointed because they really could have got a great script out of the plot points they had. There's a lot of potential here, the scenery was beautiful, the ideas for a modern dino Park very good (I want a dinosaur petting zoo :/), but it was just so committed to being stupid that it was exactly that."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,hrgilbert,37,Fri Jun 12 07:50:07 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with every point except regarding the climax. I think... I think I needed that insanely over-the-top finale to somewhat redeem the previous hour and a half.  I'd add the inconsistent CGI (mostly leaning toward ""mediocre""), which was made more glaring by the stellar animatronic work in the bronto/apatosaurus death scene and with the I-Rex jaws seen from beneath the vehicle.  The cinematography was a mess. It was shot so flatly, with too much sheen and it just didn't feel like a lived-in theme park. The kinetic camera nearly ruined the nostalgia in the gallimimus stampede homage and the badass ending fight scene, which honestly looked straight out of Transformers. The best shots in the film were static, harkening back to Spielberg and his sensibilities. I think one of my favorites was the I-Rex hovering over the waterfall after the kids jump. Another was when the raptors change sides and all four of their monitors show them looking hungrily at the troops.  And the music. Oh, what did you do Giacchino? The beats are almost entirely off. From the awkward rise of the classic theme during the opening (before they've even shown the park!) to the music unnecessarily permeating other scenes such as Owen and Claire's talk at his bungalow. Jurassic Park used the music so well that it became iconic. This was a parody.  It lacked the heart and the soul and the wonder which should've come from the younger brother character, but didn't. It lacked the suspense and the horror. I-Rex broke out, what, barely 30 minutes in? How many times are you gonna forget she can smell you behind the damn obstacle?  With all that said, it was a mediocre blockbuster and a disappointing Jurassic Park film. Much like Lost World and JPIII, it has some truly great moments. It's also pretty funny. But also like the other sequels, this was incohesive, a little disrespectful despite nice homages, and too absurd (weaponized dinos).  6.5/10 and the point-five is entirely due to the ending fight."

It feels like the passing of a torch. These movies aren't for me anymore, they're for 13-year-olds. And that's okay. I guess. Sigh. It's better than Transformers or Battleship or TMNT or any of the other ludicrous franchise blockbusters kids love these days. One redditor I can't recall said it was like Marvel's Jurassic Park. It's harmless (ha!), dumb fun for two hours and the final scene had my jaw dropping, then smiling, then drooling like a loon. But it is not my Jurassic Park. It is not a great film.

Then I remembered Jeff Goldblum and how fucking creepy he was in JP, I loved it, so I'm thinking - mostly, yes, I would've disliked it but glad I saw it for 'the ride' and of course, Chef Goldblum."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,MUSTKILLNOOBS,20,Wed Jun 17 09:27:26 2015 UTC,"They realllllllly should have just ditched the JP4 script and started over. There's 8 credited writers and god knows how many other people touched it in the 14 years it spent in development hell. The script was an absolute trainwreck and easily the weakest point.  I really liked the world building. Getting to see a fully operational park that was trying to stay relevant was a really good idea that I thought they executed well. The spotty CGI didn't bother me too much, which surprised me.  I definitely didn't like the directing though. The studio obviously picked Colin Trevorrow because he was passionate about the source material, but didn't have enough blockbuster experience so they could tell him what to do. Everything was just really flat and emotionless. Maybe he'll find his voice later, but there's a reason Spielberg and Lucasfilm love him. They tell him to do X and he gives them exactly X with no flair.  Overall, it wasn't bad. I'd put it over JP:LW and III, but it was still messy."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,BLUYear,6,Fri Jun 12 13:28:41 2015 UTC,"The climatic take was one of the only good moments in the movie for me. Especially like how they manage to pull off a long take without losing its statement of ousting the threat. Because of this technique, it created tension that have been absent through the majority of the film."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,BZenMojo,3,Fri Jun 12 20:10:58 2015 UTC,"Isn't it true that the director pretty much scrapped the original script and re-wrote the film so he could do it how he wanted? To add to that, I enjoyed how the film falls prey to it's own pseudo-commentary on the whole ""bigger, louder, more teeth, cooler"" area of it's ideas. It becomes a bloated mess that resembles the very thing it starts out chastising."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,BLUYear,5,Sat Jun 13 11:45:59 2015 UTC,"You'd think that, but someone posted the original JP4 script on Scribd. People say they scrapped the original ideas all of the time, but if there's another writer's name on it... they didn't. And it's obvious from this movie that they didn't."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,HalfBurntToast,3,Sun Jun 14 19:31:30 2015 UTC,So this was like this from the get-go. I'm bummed.
TrueFilm,39jwc1,MUSTKILLNOOBS,5,Sun Jun 14 19:36:17 2015 UTC,"Totally agree! It's really odd to me how positive the reception for this movie has been. I have to wonder if I saw the same movie. I'm a huge JP fan and it carries a lot of nostalgia for me, like many other people. But, when the only characters in the entire move that I'm interested in, or feel bad for, end up being the raptors, it feels like something went really wrong.   Almost nothing made any sense. Nothing. They somehow managed to make this park more of a death trap than the original movie, both in terms of having virtually no security and extreme employee incompetence, yet got the green-light to open. Everyone talks like they're in one of those cringy TV cop/forensic comedy shows. Half the time, the scenes and shots made me feel like I was watching a car commercial. InGen and this park are led by idiots. There was so much flashy visual fluff that it became distracting from what should have been the plot.   Ugh. This was the Star Wars Episode II of Jurassic Park. Seriously, though, just give me a movie about the raptors cause they were frickin cool."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,MUSTKILLNOOBS,23,Tue Jun 16 05:06:42 2015 UTC,"If anything, Jurassic World taught me how seemingly small technical errors can break a film. With the antagonist dinosaur, nearly all of its mystery was taken away through exposition, its strengths and weaknesses revealed before the antagonist is unveiled. Displaying the whole dinosaur did not help, removing the suspense the imagination creates when dealing with a looming monster, adding an abstract layer of danger to the situation from fear of the unknown. Because of these decisions, the antagonist did not feel like a threat because we already know that it is stoppable and concrete.  However, what killed it for me where the perspective shots from the POV of the antagonist dinosaur. I thought we, the audience, should now root for the dinosaur due to this humanization, leaving me confused for a large portion of the film.  Am I supposed to support the dinosaur? Hate the dinosaur? Why is the narrative ignoring the intricacies it gave to this antagonist? Who is this movie even about?  The film felt like it was developed from script's first draft."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,MUSTKILLNOOBS,11,Fri Jun 12 19:59:42 2015 UTC,Am I supposed to support the dinosaur?    That reminds me when Alien 3 did that and I'm pretty sure that's what you were supposed to think.
TrueFilm,39jwc1,crustinXbeiber,10,Fri Jun 12 20:04:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I have a right to say this but it did not feel 100 percent intentional in this film. It would have been an interesting decision but the film was not consistent with that inquiry. By the second half, we are just straight up told that the dinosaur is a straight up bad guy, ignoring the earlier examination of its motives. I could be wrong though."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,zappymax,7,Fri Jun 12 20:21:41 2015 UTC,For sure. MonsterCam only works if you think the characters deserve it.
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Tomislav_Sunic,5,Fri Jun 12 22:33:41 2015 UTC,"Never heard the term MonsterCam before, will most likely use it in the future, thank you."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Erigion,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:43:33 2015 UTC,"I think they were pretty objective about the dinosaurs purpose, it was just an animal made to be really dangerous because it's cool that is acting on its instinct to kill because it just is."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,TheAustinKnight,2,Tue Jun 23 09:26:33 2015 UTC,"I've never looked at it that way, I guess because the first time I remember seeing that type of shot was in Evil Dead, and it was mostly used as a way to show the action without showing the monster.  I think that would be a plausible explanation for Jurassic World doing it, wasn't that scene well before they showed a full shot of the dino?"
TrueFilm,39jwc1,derpyco,22,Tue Jun 16 00:58:04 2015 UTC,"People already listing great criticisms so here's a few random complaints:   The dinos never had a great reveal.  (The park did, oddly enough.).  We were never properly reintroduced to dinos, I think the first dinosaur in the movie is the I Rex in his cage...which was also a disappointing reveal.  I think they thought it was clever that he was obscured by bushes but to me the weight of the animal was already gone, unlike the t Rex in the first Jurassic Park who gets a great intro by never even showing up when he's being goaded (more like GOATED, har har). Nothing feels real in this movie, from the dinos to the control room.  The control room in Jurassic Park felt lived in, probably because it wasn't lazily set up with tons of meaningless extras turning knobs or whatever, and they all looked like they belonged there - rather some good looking and sassy 30-year-olds. I watched the film in Madison.  Dane County airport is never, ever that busy.  (I'm kidding, but it's a fitting note for how they seemed to approach everything: airports mean people!  Everywhere!  Cram them in every bit of the frame!  There must always be something in every bit of the frame moving! Example of some shitty directing: when the kids get knocked outside down in their impenetrable bubble, we continue cutting between a boring two shot of them dangling while watching the I Rex tear into the herbivore.  Rather than put us in the kids shoes and make it scarier by shooting the attack in POV - so, upside down as well - we get some boring generic shots of the I Rex killing this thing.  The film's full of missed opportunities like that.   It seems everything I loved as a kid keeps getting destroyed as an adult, so all in all no surprises here.  But who's going to finally break that trend?"
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Nevtendo,9,Sat Jun 13 06:28:55 2015 UTC,"Hopefully JJ breaks that trend. Oh god, please JJ break the trend."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,PizzaRehab,8,Sat Jun 13 06:50:49 2015 UTC,"Me too, but I don't know if he can.  Part of me thinks the reason these movies keep sucking is because the whole effort is destined to fail before they start.  We just want to see the originals again for the first time.  It ain't happening."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,ciociosanvstar,7,Sat Jun 13 08:04:54 2015 UTC,"If movies of the quality of Jurassic world, the Avengers, and the fast and the furious series keep making the ridiculous amount of cash that they do, I doubt this trend will die anytime soon.  Mad Max was a reboot, I really enjoyed (that and it follows being the only films I've seen in theaters in the last 2 years) so I thought I'd give JW a try. Boy was I disappointed."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Limond,8,Sun Jun 14 20:25:58 2015 UTC,"I don't have too much to add to the people, deservedly, ripping apart this movie for its shallow and idiotic characters, idiotic plot, idiotic themes, and idiotic everything. But what I find most interesting is how Jurassic World tries and fails to use the wonder of Jurassic Park.  The most blatant example is the placement of the Jurassic Park theme. In the original, its climax introduced us to our first dinosaur. In Jurassic World, it's used to introduce us to a theme park. This was the closest this movie came to making me weep. Trading in nostalgia is the most difficult thing these sequels/remakes/reboots has to do. This movie failed miserably with the theme and then it had the nerve to bring back the Jeeps and gadgets for no reason other than to bring them back which is a terrible way to use nostalgia.  There's also the younger brother, who's so memorable I never bothered to remember his name even during the movie, who is a direct descendant of Tim. His problem is that excitement and wonder coming from a young boy will never match the wonder (criticize the Spielberg face all you want) from two professionals of the field who never imagined they would see what they've studied for all their life. None of the adults in Jurassic World suffer from pesky things like wonder. They're only in there to screech about their work. When it comes displaying two extremes, you can't do it halfway in a movie. It's an artform that punishes you for waffling. Commit to showing the wonder of the world or show how mundane it is. Or commit to both so deeply, the comparison borders on the absurd.  The best and most realistic part of the movie was the teenager operating the gyrosphere ride. I've seen that kid when I go to an amusement park. I know that kid because I had him for a friend. I want the Adventureland version of this movie: A bunch of disaffected ride/game operators and their interactions while the park around them goes to shit.  About the seemingly infinite number of directors who have been snatched up to direct these sequels/reboots after one or two small films, as Alex Pappademas over at Grantland wrote, the crime is the unmade films that these directors won't have a chance to write/direct. They are babysitting these franchises thanks to the truckloads of money the studios can send their way. I don't blame them for taking the real paycheck instead of toiling away on a passion project that might not see the light of a projection bulb much less turn a profit after running the festival gauntlet.  Edit: I kinda want to see an article from Slate or Buzzfeed titled: ""I run the day to day operations at Walk Disney World. Here's how I would run Jurassic World.""  Also, the deus rex machina doesn't work in this film.  Boom."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,SupervillainIndiana,29,Sun Jun 14 01:24:25 2015 UTC,"It feels to me like the first half of this film, which indulges everyone's Jurassic Park dreams, is nothing more than an apology for the second half. For the first thirty minutes I was surprisingly enjoying myself--it really did feel like the JP sequel my childhood had dreamed of, and better! There was joking about corporatism, throwbacks to Spielberg all over the place, and an interesting plotline being set up about people in it for the love of the craft being forced to simply ""go big""--a swipe at Hollywood if ever there was one.  And then Chris Pratt enters and suddenly that all gets thrown out in favor of making the movie into Avengers With Dinosaurs.  Ok, maybe not Avengers exactly, but once Pratt comes on screen the movie very definitely turns into Standard 10s Blockbuster Iteration Infinity. Needless quips all over the place. Tonal inconsistency that could give you whiplash. Static characters. Forced romantic subplot with undertones that really rustle my feminist jimmies. And, of course, the inevitable destruction porn.  Good Lord, the destruction porn. What made the original Jurassic Park so frightening was how limited the destruction was--and how every inch of it counted. When people got eaten in JP, it was horrifying, even if it was on the toilet; in JW, it's still horrid, although now my horror mostly comes from how casual the wanton blood is and how disgustingly lightly it's treated. When the man on the toilet gets eaten, it's a funny-scary death for a minor villain. When the distracted babysitter gets waterboarded by a pterodactyl and then turduckened by a dinosaur Shamu, it's just needlessly violent, unnerving, and cruel.  There was a real sense of loss when the original Jurassic Park was destroyed; when Jurassic World is, it's simply a foregone conclusion, because God forbid we have a blockbuster that doesn't end in a desensitized mass destruction of innocents these days. Jurassic World is a world of cardboard and logos, not dreams and wonder, so who gives a fuck if it's violently rearranged?  This lack of empathy is my real problem with the film. I don't care about these characters, because calling them characters is a lie. They're caricatures, action figures, plot drivers, anything except real, breathing people I can empathize with. And their world is just as hollow."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,BPsandman84,24,Fri Jun 12 20:55:12 2015 UTC,"Ugh. Very surprised at the good reviews. Actually walked out I was so bored and offended. Let's start with the positives...  Good   Yes, the movie does in fact contain dinosaurs Uh... there are dinosaurs? Chris Pratt is good in everything, so he does help the movie a lot   Bad   Oh my, the crux of the movie. By which I mean the leads' relationship. A career girl realizes that she actually wanted a husband and family after all. Please. Women aren't children, they can decide what they want or do not want. Shoehorning in this cheesy crap really undermines what little fun there was Cheesy archetypes in general. Vaguely heavy military badman. Minorities getting sent to the slaughter posthaste (I'm pretty sure we see Jose and Manuel die on the monitors, though I can't be sure). Teenagers aren't vapid to the point of having no personality. Was the younger brother fuckin Rainman as well? What was up with his shaman-like mumblings? Poor acting damn near all round as well (guess casting got slashed at some point). Plot is nonsense. I felt like 5 different movies were happening at once. Undeveloped plotlines abound (too many to even list) Pacing is super jarring. We go from gruesome death scenes to idyllic moments, instead of building smoothly.  Bad editing. Not normally something I notice unless it's abnormal, but the editing felt rushed. Lots of pointless lingering shots, scenes don't feel appropriately cut.   I don't have a lot of nostalgia for the series, as some do, but I was still excited. I left very disappointed. I feel as though everyone is giving it a pass because it has dinosaur action. The whole thing was really boring."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Slickrickkk,14,Sat Jun 13 05:54:12 2015 UTC,"Didn't like it. Gave me a bit of nostalgia but thats about it. Didn't really feel like it offered much more than the previous movies had already done, other than of course this mega genetically altered dinosaur.   It hit every trope in the book down to the two love interests walking into the sunset holding hands. The inexplicably evil business oriented douche bags. Not to mention that the female lead is supposed to be someone you root for, and she has a position of power, but she seems to be completely incapable of handling anything at all, and she would so easily put people in danger to save her frankenstein monster.   I want to elaborate on the female lead. Thinking a little more about it, it feels super condescending towards women. She is a professional women that has an important role but was incapable of anything until a man comes in and helps her? And then she ends up with that man? She is a professional, and because of that, she is awful with her family and nephews, doesn't want kids, is single, has no personality, and cares about her vanity in her creation rather than the protection of other human beings? I am not usually a person who thinks of feminist issues in movies, and I am quite aware of the fact that many hollywood roles for women are pretty lacking and also sexist, but to me this is pretty blantant.   I also felt the movie hit every Jurassic Park trope, including the main dinosaur being caged up in the same exact looking enclosure, with a crane lowering cattle into it. Apparently it exists in a world where they are self aware of the previous events of Jurassic Park but takes no new precautions other than gps tracking to prevent anything from going wrong again. Actually, they make the dinosaurs SMARTER so its pretty much inevitable.   I liked (sarcastically) how they kept zooming into the asian swat team members face making me think he was gonna be a badass and he dies within a minute of going into action.   I might as well have just watched them film on set in the studio with the green screens because absolutely nothing gave me the suspension of disbelief.   almost none of the other dinosaurs were cool.   Jurassic Park is supposed to be about world building, I didn't see that at all in this movie. None of the creatures were creative and most of them don't even play any role in the movie at all.   And wtf that Dinosaur UFC fight.   I wasn't expecting much, but I at least thought maybe some nostalgia would kick in and I would be entertained.  EDIT* added some about how I felt the female lead was treated."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,QuixoticMcGee,7,Sun Jun 14 17:36:33 2015 UTC,"I am seriously surprised at the amount of positive feedback over at r/movies, but then again it has over 7 million subscribers so it's a pretty mainstream and casual crowd over there. To rephrase my previous thoughts I posted in /r/movies I enjoyed the movie, but I didn't love it or very much like it. There is nothing wrong with enjoying a big blockbuster movie, but Jurassic World was nowhere near as memorable or like able to me as Jurassic Park or any of the sequels were. I enjoyed parts of the movie, because who doesn't love seeing Dinosaurs on the big screen, but there was no depth to the writing, characters, directing, or anything else really. It's obvious this movie caters to this generation of movie goers, but as a grown adult and fan of the original movies I wasn't satisfied with Jurassic World."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Aquadon28,8,Sat Jun 13 20:12:22 2015 UTC,"I saw the film last night at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences screening. They brought the producer, Trevarrow, BDH, the visual director, and the paleontology consultant (Jon Horner, not Phil Tippett) on stage afterward for Q&A. They all talked about the successful points of the movie: the fact that the raptors were actually played by people so they could interact with the human characters, the effectiveness of the practical prop for the dying long neck, how much fun it was to bring I-rex and T-Rex on screen together. I kind of have to agree with all that.   They glossed over the films IMMENSE failure though, which is that they didn't go the Mad Max route. No one came to this movie for the dialogue or the considerations of profitability vs. ethics. No one cares. No one cares about some shitty family that doesn't get along. But those elements were the entirety of the first and most of the second act. Not only did this Hollywood schlock filler take too much time, it was not well done at all. I would have been intrigued by the eccentric CEO presenting an impassioned argument for pressing forward in the face of immense risk. I would have worried about a kid who acts out in a really dangerous environment because he's scared that his parents are splitting up. But it was all so poorly done. I think the filmmakers could have focused on one of those dynamics and used it to drive the plot, but it felt like they were trying to jam 7 subplots into this movie for no good reason.   People came to watch dinosaurs on screen. I wish they had just made the first half of the movie the visitor experience in the park with everything going well. Show the cuddly dinosaurs more! Spend more time and money making them look great! They could have just cut from 45 minutes of Walking with Dinosaurs to the scene where I-rex gets out and the movie would have been 100x better."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Vinsanity5,7,Sun Jun 14 16:14:41 2015 UTC,"The kids added nothing to the film. They were merely a poor plot point that needed to be tossed in because the other movies had kids in it. They never helped the adults in any situation, unless you count ""We need more teeth."" as being sage advice that the little kid gives to Claire to go get OG T-Rex. In JP2 the kid kills a raptor, even if the scene was stupid. JP3 Grant is saved by the kid with some Rex pee. The kids literally add nothing except as a device to go around and view the features of the park. Easily could have done it with Owen touring the facility making sure the everything is secure.    Also the Gyroscope Ride is ridiculous. Especially the part where the little kid asks ""Where are they?"" and the literal very next shot a second later is a scene of about 20 dinosaurs right in front of them doing dino stuff.      Chris Pratt was JP1s Grant/Muldoon replacement and he failed in every single way. No reason why he was so good with the animals, or even why they would want his opinion on the structural weaknesses that may be found. Completely failure by the writers.  As an actor Chris Pratt works best in action comedies like Guardians of the Galaxy  . He doesn't look smart or serious enough to handle non comedy action films.    This is probably my least favorite in the JP series. JP1, JP2/JP3 then this one. Too much handwaving and plot holes for me to really get into the film."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,alfreedom,6,Sun Jun 14 22:11:17 2015 UTC,"I am not sure how I feel exactly now I've had a couple of days to digest this film.  Let's just say I went in with extremely low expectations and as a result I ended up actually having fun. I know this does not always make a film good and Jurassic World is definitely not up there with the first Jurassic Park. Not by a long way. This is in part because the second half of the film basically rehashes elements that made JP so memorable, but does it in a way where it just feels like a nostalgia grab.  Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the nostalgia. I am not ashamed to admit I got kind of choked up when the boys discovered the remains of the old visitor centre. That was part of my childhood right there, and it brought home how much time has passed.  Despite what I said earlier I actually preferred the second half overall. I found the set-up in the first half kind of boring. The park didn't seem to have a soul. One of my main criticisms is we've probably been asking for 20 years ""what if Jurassic Park had actually taken off?"" and the functioning park was an opportunity to explore that but even though we get all that set-up it just feels kind of...there. As I've seen a lot of other people saying, why wasn't there more of the park after the chaos began? Apart from the one scene where everyone is evacuating in terror I never felt like we saw how much disaster striking affected the park and more importantly the public within the park.  Also I really did have trouble with a theme park attraction seemingly allowing guests control over their route. That was a recipe for disaster even without the killer dino on the loose!  Unlike a lot of people I really loved the final show down. Yeah it was kind of cheesy but I think by that point I was definitely in the frame of mind where I thought ""we're here for cool dinosaurs, there's not much else to it"" - I cared very little for most of the human cast. I just wanted cool dinosaur stuff. I know that's a weak defense of the film but it really appealed to the child within my heart!  Interestingly I thought I would absolutely hate the idea of trained raptors but I thought it was actually ok. The twist with the I-Rex was eyeroll worthy though. Saw it coming a mile away. Maybe kids don't. I keep trying to remember JW is going to be a lot different for an 8 year old. Maybe it will be the same as JP was for 8 year old me?  I don't think it is the worst in the franchise but I'm starting to feel like nothing will touch JP. And I don't even think JP is perfect!"
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Methatrex,15,Sat Jun 13 17:58:07 2015 UTC,"Brief thoughts before addressing the discussion bullet points I'll simply say that for the most part I enjoyed it. It's a very efficient film that keeps going, which kept my pulse up. I have some obvious issues with the film, but they're not obnoxious enough to make me dislike it. It's functional fun, and I'm perfectly satisfied with that. Didn't hurt that my expectations have been pretty low since the first trailer.   How do you rank the Jurassic Park films? Do you like more than one of them, only the original, or do any of the sequels surpass the original for you?   Obviously the original is still on top, but for entertainment value alone (and I'll get to this in the next point) Jurassic World is the best sequel. It's the only one that actually tries to be both thrilling and about something. The Lost World follows next, if only because Spielberg's direction in it is so wild. Jurassic Park 3 is the worst since it's pretty much just a straight to DVD B movie with little going for it.   Colin Trevorrow, along with Josh Trank and Duncan Jones, are directors mainly known for small science fiction films who have been given the lead on major franchise movies. How is that working out?   Can't speak for Trank since Fantastic Four isn't out yet. I am interested in why Trevorrow was picked because between this and Safety Not Guaranteed I can't pick out any sense of style. It honestly feels like he's just a director for hire here. Most of this film was probably made in the Pre-viz department.   That's the only area The Lost World beats this film in. The Lost World has style coming out of it like it's Vogue's big Winter edition. It's a film that has no purpose but it absolutely feels stylistically alive. Jurassic World? I can't recall a single image from the film that isn't burned into my head from seeing the trailer a billion times.   Is Jurassic World in the spirit of Jurassic Park or does it go in a different direction?   Kind of both. It's very clearly a studio film first in that it needs everything to be bigger and badder (and more violent), but there's bits of it that capture that consumer self reflection that the first one did. It, of course, isn't done by Spielberg with Hammond as a self insert, so the whole thing just feels tacked on rather than a soulful lament for becoming a Dr. Frankenstein of entertainment.   How do you feel about Chris Pratt as a movie star?   His character in this film is absolutely nonexistent and is pretty much just your average serious male character in about any action movie. That said, Pratt here displays why he's going to last for a long time as a movie star: He's naturally likable. Pratt's not a great actor (As Armond White said in what has to be his most hilarious piece ever) but he is a great movie star. He has charm and the camera likes him. Would like to see him in another movie where he actually has, y'know, a character before I draw the already hastily drawn Harrison Ford comparisons."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Theworldsdumbestman,8,Fri Jun 12 09:37:20 2015 UTC,"Pratt isn't the new Bogart, he reminds me more of early Gary Cooper or Jack Lemmon or someone like that.  Everyone already has their knives out over Fantastic Four but between these two movies I think we're about to find out why it's not true that someone who has technically directed a movie before can fill the shoes of an experience blockbuster director, even on a 'studio' feature. Seems like it's all PR these days.  reads Armond's article   OMG."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,teleekom,5,Fri Jun 12 13:19:34 2015 UTC,I still think of Tom Hanks as the Jack Lemmon of these times.

TrueFilm,39jwc1,BZenMojo,3,Sat Jun 13 00:23:02 2015 UTC,Not sure Pratt has gotten a role that actually lets him show off his acting chops or nuance. Haven't seen Zero Dark Thirty yet though.
TrueFilm,39jwc1,chibro2,6,Fri Jun 12 22:54:46 2015 UTC,He's not in it very much.
TrueFilm,39jwc1,alfreedom,4,Fri Jun 12 23:26:46 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you. For me this wasn't necessarily a bad movie, it wasn't good either. It was a popcorn movie and nothing more. While it is nowhere near as good as the first movie, to me it was much better than the last two movies. I respect it for making nods to the source material of the book.  I appreciated the fact that the movie realized the fact that these are not dinosaurs, but artificial organisms that were purposely designed to the imaginations of the creators.    However, it doesn't excuse the fact that the movie was poorly written.The plot rushed in way too fast with the I-rex breaking out, I was surprised it happened within 20 minutes of the kids arriving on the island.  The kids themselves are interesting to me. As characters they are generic and cliche. I feel like I enjoyed them more at first when I saw them as an analogy for fans of the series. On one hand our inner child wanted to be excited about the movie. We wanted to be in awe like we were in when we saw Jurassic Park for the first time. On the other hand we were skeptics and knew that this movie could not awe us, this is just  more of the same. I feel that these  kids would have worked better if they were written as such.   The best part of the movie was Christ Pratt, specifically when he was training the raptors and he was petting them in the cages. This was new. I feel the movie would have been better if the story focused more on man trying to tame the wild instead of the ethics of genetic engineering, because in all honesty it wasn't anything new.  And the final scene when I saw the T-rex walking up the building to the helipad, I cringed. That has to be the most generic way to have ended the movie."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Methatrex,5,Fri Jun 12 18:43:51 2015 UTC,"The more I think about it the more I realized that they really should have just simplified the movie a bit. The first movie went something like...""dinosaurs trying to eat us.... Lets run"" where this one was more..... ""Lets create a genetic hybrid. What's in it? I don't know. It escaped. No it didn't. Now it did. Cuddle fish DNA!? I want to use raptors in war. Jk I wanna use indominus rex in war. Billinaire is dead. Fat awful actor is second in charge apparently. Raptors are against the humans. Raptors are for the humans. and finally EPIC DINOSAUR FIGHT SCENE LIKE WE ALL WANTED."" The writers truly could have spent a lot less time trying to fill the movie with plot twists and a lot more time working on non-idiotic dialogue. Still enjoyed the movie overall though. The final fight scene and the pterodactyls being set loose saved the movie for me."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Limond,11,Sun Jun 14 05:26:36 2015 UTC,"Is it just me, or can we talk about how almost every female character in this movie got condescendingly treated by the script? Watching this after watching Mad Max and Tomorrowland just opened my eyes and raised some red flags.  Claire, of course they had to pair her up with Owen at the end. Of course she needed a strong, ""badass"" alpha male to set her straight. Of course business is going to keep a woman from being a good family person. Of course they're going to have her say ""oh, I don't want kids."" I swear, even John Hammond, who was arguably even more deluded and caught up in his vision of Jurassic Park, was still shown as a good family man.  Zara, well, we all know how she ended up.  Vivian, the girl in the control room, was actually a nice pairing with the other control room guy. But, of course, they had to have him ask her out. Although the way that scene ended up was actually pretty funny.  I just can't look past this, especially Claire's character arc. So much this that I noticed seemed unnecessary and I don't think would have happened if the characters were male."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,BLUYear,8,Sat Jun 13 22:16:15 2015 UTC,"Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard had absolutely no chemistry together. There wasn't a scenario I could come up with why Chris Pratt's character would have ever asked her out in the first place. I mean, aside from ""she's hot.""  Still though, there's got to be plenty of other women who meet that criteria and at have least one other good trait."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,A113-09,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:39:20 2015 UTC,"Really, I thought the chemistry was great! It's what made his 'cheesy' lines seem liek a character choice to get under her skin, rather than what everyone seems to be saying is bad writing. He says everything with innuendo/smirk because he knows raunchy or forward isn't her style--he's flirting with her while toning down the stuff he's thinking. That's why the ending line 'stick together for survival' was a fun wink at their going out again/being together, rather than saying 'how about that second date' etc.   I also loved how Claire cried silent tears when super scared -- she's feminine, corporate,  and very realistic, but crying in fear of dying so as not make a noise behind the jeep doesn't stop her from action stuff,  running or grabbing weapons or driving etc. She's not some badass safari nut or paleontologist with an adventure life, just an anxious uptight woman who came to work that day like normal who has to adapt and overcome her fears in a crazy situation."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,lateral_jambi,5,Thu Jun 18 00:48:38 2015 UTC,"This movie was such a let down. It is jurassic park for fans of transformers. Honestly I am not sure this film is better than jp3. The score was awful. This hardly ever is an issue with me, but I often found the score sticking out like a sore thumb as I watching scenes. Characters were not developed. At all. They were all stock versions of the characters they were supposed to be. Cool former military guy. Smart kid. Hormonal teenage brother. That's it. That could have been their names on the script. There was ZERO sense of awe of wonder in this film. There were zero memorable action scenes. Jp had the raptors in the kitchen. The car and T. rex. JP:  LW had that awesome cliff scene. This had nothing. I never felt the characters were in grave danger. Even if the characters had been killed I would have felt nothing. Characters were beyond idiotic. For example they go into the i-Rex pen within minutes of looking at the thermal radar even though they have the capability of tracking it??? They coudnt have waited 2 minutes to check???? There are so many problems with this film Im just at a loss. And it scares me that there seems to be a mostly positive reaction from the public and even on /r/movies. I fear we will be seeing more films closer to this than the original."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Slickrickkk,4,Sun Jun 14 23:43:05 2015 UTC,"I think it was okay, definitely better than I expected from the trailers. The script was dumb as hell to the point it really took you out of the movie how none of this was making any sense. There are movies where I can forgive things not making sense and I was pretty much ready for doing this in case of JW, but my god so many things in this movie was just absolutely idiotic.  Cris Pratt was great, in the end I liked Bryce Dallas Howard also, even though I gotta say that her acting were kinda off sometimes (like was she having an orgasm in that helicopter at the start of the movie or what?), they had great chemistry together I think. The child actors were godawful, I simply wanted to strangle the older one everytime he was on screen, could you use even more clichéd archetype of a bored millenial teenager next time pretty please? Vincent D'nofrio I love you, but his character was just awfully written and his plot was downright retarded.  It wasn't boring though and I guess that's what counts the most, I think they captured the atmosphere really well and just had a good time watching it."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,TDKshorty,8,Mon Jun 15 08:09:41 2015 UTC,"Despite script issues galore (ham fisted dialogue being the least of it's concerns), stylistically pretty bland and being enamoured with it's roots (not just with visual easter eggs but repetition of set pieces and shot structure) this is a hugely satisfying blockbuster.  Science, like cinema, has become intwined with business, progress and art is only measured as far as profit made - something the film is all too quick to fess up to with the Samsung logos plastered on everything. It just about pulls it off with Bryce Dallas Howard gradually shedding her business suit to turn into Lara Croft by the end completing the essentialist renegade arc.   Like wise, the film is very much an attempt to catch up to the industry it lead some twenty years back. Dinosaurs just don't interest people any more is reiterated throughout the first twenty minutes. I don't know how much the film actually believes this. The new hybrid is bigger, louder and tougher but the really big, crowd pleasing moments are reserved for classics like the T-rex and the Raptors.   Still complaints aside, it's kind of endearing in the age of information over load and cynicism that a film is confident enough in delivering childlike wonder, dread and excitement in it's attractions and the sincerity of it's characters to leap logic boundaries and unabashedly deliver on the dreams of the ten year olds trapped inside the minds of twenty-somethings. If Jurassic Park is a B-movie turned A-movie by the basis of the talent involved, then Jurassic World is all to satisfied sit in the former category. It's more guilty pleasure than genre defining classic. Yet there are flourishes of greatness and light world building hints.    As a kid at the zoo I always imagined I would hide in the toilets if the tiger escaped, now I know the answer would be to ride into battle on top of the ostriches. Add two points for not putting any feathers on the T-rex, take one off for it still looking worse than the original."

TrueFilm,39jwc1,chibro2,8,Fri Jun 12 22:37:58 2015 UTC,"Chris Pratt is that perfect combination of handsome and relatable. Unfortunately, this also means he's going to constantly get cast to play roles written as shitty assholes you don't like one bit except for the guy playing him because no one wants to put in character work or come up with a personality type other than ""edgy anti-hero"" in an action film.  I'll say this all day long. Chris Pratt is a puppy dog, your best friend, your little league assistant coach. He's no more a badass than first-run John McClane on a good day. He's comic relief with mean guns. You could make the most endearing action hero in the world if you wrote him to Pratt's strengths -- honesty and earnestness. But it looks like The Rock keeps getting those roles (and The Rock can also play a hard-ass fucker as well when he wants to, Pratt doesn't have that range)."
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Dark1000,9,Sun Jun 14 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"Also found here:   http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/39mzjl/i_went_into_jurassic_world_with_an_open_mind_but/  reposted below for your convenience.  TLDR: Jurassic World is like the Kmart of films, it's a big piece of commercial junk trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator, but doesn't even do that as well as Wal-Mart.  I think if you're the kind of person who think it's always ok to give your kids McDonald's for dinner, then you'll definitely like the movie. If you're the kind of person who refuse to buy McDonald's for your kids, but recognize that you yourself just freaking needs McDonald's sometimes, then you'll enjoy JW given the right mood. If you're the kind of person who does not find junk food gratifying, then you'll probably not like this movie.   The long version. Like everyone else, I am a huge fan of Jurassic Park. And like many others, I saw the trailers/clips/reviews and went into this movie with low expectations, all I wanted was to just have some fun, and I have to admit, Jurassic World didn't even do that much for me. In short, the whole movie reads like a fan-fiction parody to the original, a thin veneer of ""wonder and excitement"" wrapped around a lot of cynicism and trying-too-hard.  The film felt completely flat emotionally. I believe the first scene was suppose to set up some foreboding atmosphere, with the slow hatching and the thump-thump heartbeat in the background (similar to the deacon birth in Prometheus perhaps?) , but the setup just looked way to polished to create any sense of unease in me. And then we jump into the introduction of the Indominus intercut with introduction of the characters, I see what they're trying to do by describing how nasty the Indominus is while withholding a full body shot until later. But unlike the velociraptor introduction scene in Jurassic Park or just a good ""horror/action"" movie, this trick did not pique my interest at all.   During this time we see the full park for the first time with the original music playing in the background, and I really really wanted to be moved by this bit as we are all moved by the original ""welcome to Jurassic Park"" scene. And they completely wasted this opportunity by showing ... buildings! And more buildings! I mean come on, what makes Jurassic Park magical was the dinosaurs, not ""oh man look here's a fully operational park with so many tourists and such pretty structure"".  So finally we intercut between the Indominus escape and the kids running off into the restricted area. I believe this whole segment is supposed to build up to the finale of the second act, where the tension rises to an unbearable crescendo until BOOM BOOM BOOM the main antagonist (the Indominus in this case I suppose?) attacks the kids, and we are left stunned, and totally surrenders to the next wave chaos that will surely come any minute. Instead, I found myself watching it and going: hmm I see what you're trying to do, hmm ... this reminds of Aliens ... funny how influential the movie is ... and at no point was I pulled into character's world.   So finally we come to act III, where the protagonist is suppose to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat (see how cliche this sentence is, this is how I feel about the movie at this point), culminating in some cathartic resolution to all this conflict. But instead we get ... a mediocre series of action scenes devoid of tension, where each one does not flow into the next one except in geographical terms: they run here, dinosaurs! they run there, more dinosaurs! finally they stop here and release ... the one we're all waiting for!  They tried too hard with the actions scenes. This is where I really feel bad for the JW crew, because not only do they have to contend with the original Jurassic Park, they also have to contend with great dinosaur/man-animal films in recent memory, and here I take issue with their strategy. The way the T-rex and the Velociraptor fights Indominus, and throw each other around makes me think they're trying to one-up King Kong. But JW can't go as far as King Kong since it is supposed to take place in the real world, so there is a boundary embedded in the premise that precludes ridiculous physics. And yet both movies features an 8 ton animal being whipped about at an completely unrealistic speed ..., how much force would that require? In the case of King Kong, who cares? But in the case of JW, it completely takes me out of the movie. But at the same time, it felt as if the film makers were cognisant enough to obey some physics. So we end up with a scene that felt neither real enough for a movie in the Jurassic Park franchise, nor wow enough for a monster movie.   Similarly the relationship between Owen and the raptors did not work for me. It was as if the film makers saw Planet of the Apes and said: hey why can't we tug at the audience's heart by having our own Caesar-James Franco moment, except with Owen and Blue? Except it is much harder to make a raptor emote versus a primate with a very human face. So here the film makers are constrained by the anatomy of a reptilian face, and again fall flat emotionally.   The characters took me out of the movie Not much I can add here to what has already been said. The only thing I would say is that a big reason the movie fails to have any tension is because you can tell the kids are not looking at anything but green screen, and they have astonishing ability to recover from psychological trauma. It's like one scene they're running away from a walking semi-trailer with teeth, and the next moment they're just strolling through the park again. The mustache-twirling villain who wants to weaponize the raptors (forget his name) is so ridiculously evil he might as well be CGI. I think part of the magic of JP and even the lost world is that the ""human villains"" are either greedy/cowardly in an oddly charming manner (similar to pixar villains, think emperor Zerg), or have a genuine point of view.   How the dinosaurs looked at moved I'm just going to stop right here, because I give up on this point.  Zara I really really hate to single this trivial detail out, I get it she left the kids unattended, and yes more men died in this movie than women. But why does Zara have to die the way she did? She didn't just die, she was tortured in a fetishized manner that is borderline pornographic. Similar to how the hot blonde bimbo would be cut up in a straight to DVD movie made for sexually frustrated boys who are two years past puberty, but have yet to get laid.   The Good The movie was not all bad, the score was pretty good and made each scene much better. I liked all of Masrani's scenes, his dialogue with Wu was pretty good. I liked how the raptors ate the mice. I appreciated how they introduced the Hibachi grill in the first third of the movie before showing a raptor scorched in it, so you're not like: oh I guess the park has a hibachi grill, ok .... And oh: http://media.giphy.com/media/UHFy9vfExuKoo/giphy.gif !"
TrueFilm,39jwc1,TheGeniuz,10,Sat Jun 13 01:29:08 2015 UTC,"The more I think about Zara the more disturbed I get. I want to say it was some self-aware moment from the script to get us to think about how horrifying some of the off-screen deaths in the Jurassic Park series really would look if we saw them through to the end.  But ""borderline pornographic"" is a good way to describe it, and it's completely uncharacteristic of the series. I don't know if it's just my feminist radar going haywire but something about the fact that she was a woman and made out to be this inept character and then get done in like that...  And the total lack of empathy, too, considering how gruesome the scene was. I don't think she's ever mentioned ever again - even poor Gennaro got a pretty convincing traumatized response (""He left us! He left us!"") from the kids afterwards.  That whole pterodactyl scene was just weird, though. How the fuck were Owen and Claire, and the kids, so calm after they shot down that biggie? Totally unrealistic to throw in some weird sexual tension while there were still pterodactyls all over the damn place killing people!"
TrueFilm,39jwc1,BZenMojo,9,Sat Jun 13 21:39:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have to say I was very uncomfortable during the Zara scene. ""Oh my god, is this still going on?"" was something I asked myself before she was even dropped into the pool.  She was at worst slightly negligent with the kids because she was given a shit job by her boss who really doesn't seem to give a shit about her nephews. At best she sounded distressed when she said she couldn't find them. And then she's killed in such, as you put it best, borderline pornographic? The thing that really kills me is that the real baddie during the movie (Vincent d'Onofrio) was such an insufferable cunt and yet he gets the ""courtesy"" of being mauled off camera. What the hell?"
TrueFilm,39jwc1,Vinsanity5,9,Sun Jun 14 06:36:49 2015 UTC,"I'm watching that scene and was like. ""Okay she's getting picked up and she is going to drop to her death. Eh, sure beats being eaten alive. Oh now she was swooped up mid fall. She is going to get tossed into a tower or something and die.  Oh the water the shark dino is going to chomp her up. Oh the pterodactyls are swooping down like king fishers, that sure was a spooky shot, time to get chomped. (I really did like that shot of them shooting into the water and missing her). Oh one of them got her, stabbed through, she sure is dead. Oh now they are thrashing her around some. Oh it is still going on. Oh she is still screaming. Oh it's still going on, a few more dunks and stabs. Oh thank god the shark thing finally ate her. That was awful and hear incompetence in no way shape or form deserved that sort of an on screen death. The only person in the entire series who may have even deserved a fraction of that is Dr. Wu or Vincents character."
TrueFilm,39fvk1,kingofthejungle223,56,Thu Jun 11 13:15:30 2015 UTC,"Very saddened to hear of his passing, but glad we had him for as long as he did.  Most probably know Lee from his appearances in the recent Lord of The Rings and Star Wars franchises, but he had a long ranging career that exhibited an affinity for the macabre and imaginative, and managed to do a lot of good stuff along the way.  He started his career as a sort of bland leading man type, and appeared in bit-parts in at least two minor masterpieces from classic Hollywood directors Nicholas Ray (Bitter Victory) and Raoul Walsh (Captain Horatio Hornblower, R.N.), before being discovered by a small independent company in Great Britain that specialized in genre cinema and drive-in fare known as Hammer Films.  He quickly became one of the studios two favorite actors (along with Peter Cushing), and the films he made there are what made him a legend within the industry.  What Hammer productions lacked in budget, they more than made up for with a combination of imagination and an infectious tastelessness.  Films like The Curse of Frankenstein, The Horror of Dracula (or any number of its sequels), The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Man Who Could Cheat Death, The Mummy, Scream of Fear, and The Skull are the films Lee will (and should) most likely be most remembered for by film buffs.  His later Hollywood career returned him to supporting roles (notably in Billy Wilder's The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes and as a James Bond villain in The Man With the Golden Gun) meatier than those he was getting before his association with Hammer, but he was very rarely the anchor of those films in the way he had been in the Hammer universe."

His favorite performance was as Mohammad Jinnah in JINNAH, about the founder of Pakistan and a nice counterpoint to Ben Kingsley/Richard Attenborough's GHANDI.

Practically 50% of everything back then was based on a book, too. And I have no issues with that, except that I'm a fan of Hitchcock's idea: if the story has already found the ideal medium, it doesn't necessarily need a film version. Hence Hitchcock not wanting to film one of Dostoevsky's books (Crime and Punishment?) because he felt he couldn't improve on it. He'd film the middle of the road novels, the airport thrillers of his day, and almost always improve them. (Besides Rebecca/Jamaica Inn which seem to be well respected.) (More great musings on cinema from Hitchcock are in Truffaut's book; highly recommended for any film fan.)  And Hitchcock's The Lodger was remade like a billion times over the decades.  One thing you don't see often anymore though is a director remaking his own flick. See: Hitchcock's UK and US versions of The Man Who Knew Too Much, and De Mille's silent and sound Ten Commandments.

Remakes, reboots, adaptations all have existing fanbases, so to studio heads they have guaranteed ticket sales.   It wasn't always this way, there used to be a lot of mid-budget movies that were original and adult-minded, Those don't make a lot of money at the box office, so studios are no longer interested in them.   Here is an article that does a better job explaining the particulars than me."
TrueFilm,39if6e,wabray17,6,Fri Jun 12 15:32:26 2015 UTC,"Remakes and reboots are new for ORIGINAL films. I mean there were books, bible stories and historical dramas that were remade (Maltese Falcon, Frankenstein,  Ben Hur) but not really original films being redone"
TrueFilm,39if6e,frakking-anustart,12,Thu Jun 11 23:13:52 2015 UTC,"That was my knee-jerk reaction as well, but Jurassic Park is based on a book. Hm.   One difference I see is the motivations behind a reboot. Jurassic Park was one of the highest grossing movies ever, and so it's hard to see any sequels or reboots as anything other than a cheap cash grab. Sherlock Holmes isn't as much of a box office guarantee, so maybe it's a little bit easier for the public to swallow.   Another difference is that Jurassic World's marketing is clearly putting it in the Jurassic Park franchise. It's using the existing graphics, score, etc. Imagine this scenario: A. Jurassic Park was written 100+ years ago and has fallen into public domain and B. the Chris Pratt movie is called Jurassic Park, not Jurassic World, and insists on being a reinterpretation of the source material. Would that movie be recieved differently [compared to Jurassic World]? I think it would, but I'm not sure.   Perhaps another difference is that Sherlock Holmes (and James Bond, among others) are long book series, even if they are not as long as their filmic counterparts. Having multiple installments highlights the literary characters, rather than any single particular adventure, and makes it easier for other writers to play with the universe. By contrast, Jurassic Park is the story of a mad scientist using mosquitos in amber to create an amusement park, which subsequently breaks down, causing the special guests to improvise an escape. It's a bit harder to add onto that story in an organic way.  EDIT: After re-reading OP's post, I'm not sure that I've actually answered the question. At all. Oh, well, maybe my ramblings will provide some more food for thought."
TrueFilm,39if6e,Flubby2,5,Thu Jun 11 23:53:40 2015 UTC,"Also, remakes of original movies have been a staple of the industry forever. Scarface, To Be or Not to Be, A Star is Born, True Grit, Magnificent Seven, Fistful of Dollars, etc..."
TrueFilm,39if6e,Flubby2,5,Fri Jun 12 00:03:13 2015 UTC,"No, but the sort of remake or reboot we talk about these days is a particular kind that's dominant today.  In the past you can see plenty of movies that are self-consciously in dialogue with each other, for example the evolution of Morocco --> Casablanca --> To Have and Have Not or Underworld --> Scarface --> Scarface. This still goes on today. What we call a 'continuity reboot' is only a dominant paradigm in one specific genre, CGI blockbusters. These movies think there's only one story about a character that anybody wants to pay to see, so that story is remade over and over. This is why sequels to superhero movies are often more creatively bold.   But that's why when today's Hollywood makes a blockbuster version of Sherlock Holmes, it has to be a reboot origin story even though everyfuckingbody knows the characters and dynamic of Sherlock Holmes and it shouldn't be necessary to do this. This is the one thing every last superhero movie has refused to do; they're almost all based on characters people are familiar with but none of them start in the middle with a world that already feels established. Other CGI blockbusters have started to do this as well; for example you can't just make a movie about Dracula or Frankenstein now even though everybody know who Dracula and Frankenstein are. It has to be a ""here's how it allllll started"" origin story movie.   But then again you still get outliers. It's obvious that The Lone Ranger was pitched as a superhero movie reboot of a TV show but that was just an excuse to get a traditional western financed in 2013.   To bring it back to Jurassic World, I haven't seen it, and I'm indifferent about how it fits into this. A few other movies were made about dinosaurs following the success of Jurassic Park, but none of them did very well. So the only way we see dinosaurs in mainstream movies now is if they are in a Jurassic Park movie. Jurassic Park didn't need a sequel, but that's why they happened anyway, because people still believe enough in the first one that they'll give dud sequel after dud sequel a chance. On the other hand, whether the movie is any good or not, it does seem they tried to evolve the story into something different and world-expanding. Not all remakes bother."
TrueFilm,39if6e,lordhadri,2,Fri Jun 12 03:15:49 2015 UTC,"I think there were always remakes and reboots, but there was room for a more diverse type of movie as well.   Now I don't think movie studios are taking risks, the big budgets go to for sure titles, which means comic books and remakes.   You can blame the studios all you want, and I do to an extent, but they are following the trends of movie goers. The audience doesn't take risks anymore. There is so many different mediums for that. Internet, netflix, the rise of cable TV, etc. Watching a movie takes so much time and effort compared to the others. Although TV can be binged, you an do it at the comfort of your own home and on your time. I think if people want to plan a day, coordinate it with friends, plan dinner, drive etc they want to know eactly what theyre going into. Unfortunate trend. I think movie studios just know this, they are just following the dollars. Also Unfortunate trend."
TrueFilm,39if6e,Nevtendo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:41:05 2015 UTC,"Just as a side note, the old saw about Sherlock Holmes being the most-portrayed character is immensely Western-centric and wrong. Wong Fei-Hung (a real-life Robin Hood in China) has been in movies by the hundreds, including being portrayed by Jackie Chan and Jet Li, among many others."
TrueFilm,39if6e,npcdel,0,Tue Jun 16 17:49:20 2015 UTC,"Tristan the knight was a open-source kind of story (sometimes only character) that European writers used as a campfire story to tell what they wanted.  He didn't have to be an archetype God, he was the everyman who worked hard, and it worked.  Out of this came real human Love. Troubadour AMOR.  So It isn't new at all to reboot a story and really be inspired by the previous art.   Open source and sharing really works!"
TrueFilm,39hf7u,ajvenigalla,23,Thu Jun 11 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"So, were the 1950s really a good decade for Hollywood cinema?   I would argue that the 1950's were the best decade for Hollywood cinema.  The benefit of the old studio infrastructure, and many of the stars they had developed, were still available, but at the same time conditions were right for the emergence of successful independent productions companies and creativity outside of the studios was flourishing.  There was an active B-movie industry that proved to be the best film school anyone has ever developed, a new group of essential directors coming to the fore and many of the titans of the industry from the silent era were still active.  In short, there was an enormous and extremely diverse group of very good films made in the 1950's.   Was the decade really a time of crass artificiality and cheap sentimentalism as seems to be the view in some circles?   Some films were, yeah - but there was a lot of great art (much of it subversive) being produced, too.  It's hard to imagine films like The Searchers, Imitation of Life, or Johnny Guitar being produced in any other decade - there was freedom enough for an artist to assault cultural norms and conventions, but enough structural support to ensure that these films were also technically immaculate.   Or was it something more than its detractors seem to assume?   Certainly.  For all of the publicity given to the New Hollywood era of the late 60's and early 70's, the real 'American New Wave' happened in the 1950's, with a group of (mostly) young filmmakers that made cinema new again through their formal audacity and often bold choice of subject matter - guys like Robert Aldrich, Stanley Donen, Joseph Losey, Douglas Sirk, Otto Preminger, Frank Tashlin, Samuel Fuller, and Nicholas Ray.  It's no coincidence that these are the guys who were most admired (and studied) by the directors who would become the pillars of the French New Wave - Jean-Luc Godard, Francois Truffaut, Eric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette and Claude Chabrol.  Of Nicholas Ray, Godard wrote ""If the cinema no longer existed, Nicholas Ray gives the impression of being capable of reinventing it, and what's more, of wanting to.""  So one generation of American filmmakers inspired a generation of French filmmakers who in turn inspired the next generation of American filmmakers - a fortuitous cycle of cultural exchange.  As far as comparing the 50's with the ""golden age"" that preceded it and the ""New Hollywood"" era that followed it, I'll say that each era has its merits, but the 1950's seemed to have more great artists active (and finding commercial success) in the medium of film than in any other generation.  The decade is an embarrassment of riches for cinephiles.  Since everyone else has been listing 50's favorites, I'll go ahead and post the some of the Hollywood films that made my personal top 10 lists of the 1950's.  I'm not going to list all of them, only a few of those that I consider masterpieces:  1950: Stars In My Crown (Jacques Tourneur), Rio Grande (John Ford), Where The Sidewalk Ends (Otto Preminger), Gun Crazy (Joseph H. Lewis), Outrage (Ida Lupino), In A Lonely Place (Nicholas Ray)  1951: The Steel Helmet (Samuel Fuller), Strangers on a Train (Hitchcock)  1952: Singin' in The Rain (Donen), The Quiet Man (Ford), My Son John (McCarey), Limelight (Chaplin), Park Row (Fuller), Son of Paleface (Tashlin)  1953: The Sun Shines Bright (Ford), The Big Heat (Lang), Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (Hawks), Pickup On South Street (Fuller)  1954: Rear Window (Hitchcock), Dial M For Murder (3D) (Hitchcock)  1955: The Long Gray Line (Ford), Night of the Hunter (Laughton), All That Heaven Allows (Sirk), Rebel Without A Cause (Ray),   1956: The Searchers (Ford), The Ten Commandments (DeMille), Written on the Wind (Sirk), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Siegel)  1957: The Sweet Smell of Success (Mackendrick), Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (Tashlin), The Tall T (Boetticher), Men In War (Mann), Jet Pilot (von Sternberg), Bitter Victory (Ray)  1958: Vertigo (1958), The Tarnished Angels (Sirk), Touch of Evil (Welles), Bonjour Tristesse (Preminger), Man of the West (Mann), Gunman's Walk (Karlson), Some Came Running (Minnelli), Party Girl (Ray)  1959: Anatomy of a Murder (Preminger), North By Northwest (Hitchcock), Day of the Outlaw (de Toth)"

TrueFilm,39hf7u,RyanSmallwood,8,Thu Jun 11 22:59:45 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as a decade without a few hundred masterpieces, so I'm not sure how far we're going to get listing a handful of our favorite 1950s films.  I've always seen 1950s as sort of a transitional decade.  Courts ruled that studios couldn't be vertically integrated anymore and other leisure activities were quickly replacing film's former central place, so production was declining from its high point in the 1940s, but it wasn't yet nearly as bad as it was in the early-mid 1960s.  Some filmmakers like Billy Wilder were pushing censorship boundaries with each film they made, but gains were still being made on this front up til the late 1960s.  Someone more deeply familiar with classic hollywood filmmaking might have a better idea of just how rapid this transition took place.  As for classic hollywood vs new hollywood overall, I'm not sure they're so easily comparable in a good vs bad sort of way, each of them has their own strengths and trade offs.  Certainly there's a number of masterpieces in the 1970s that would've been inconceivable in the classic studio era.  But the studio system also gave directors the remarkable opportunity to practice and hone their craft over many many films, and few modern directors can boast the same outputs as some of the most productive directors of the classic era.  In later decades there also seems to be a much steeper dropoff in quality from the masterpieces to everything else, whereas in the classic studio system even lesser known directors were still pretty well practiced in their craft and had tons of highly skilled personnel and resources behind them."
TrueFilm,39hf7u,PM_YR_HOT_BODY,4,Thu Jun 11 23:09:49 2015 UTC,All About Eve was 1950 IIRC.. Great film. Billy Wilder was also doing great things around this time. You should check out the film All About Eve if you like the 50s. Its about a group of theater actors.

The big theme of this time was the red scare, which was felt through all sorts of films from westerns (High Noon) to science fiction (Forbidden Planet) and went on to shape a more reflective Hollywood.   There was an influx of films that challenged people's perceptions and beliefs - some that come to mind are The Searchers, 12 Angry Men, A Face in the Crowd and Paths of Glory. This is far removed from a '50s Hollywood of phony sentimentality."

The Ian Fleming novel “Moonraker” is about Bond investigating a murder and espionage at a secret rocket base that was developing the world’s first ICBM, code-named ""Moonraker.""  (The novel came out in 1955; the first ICBM was tested in 1957.  The book was was topical in its day.)  The shocking twist is that the genius industrialist behind it, Hugo Drax, was a former Nazi turned Soviet spy, and the test launch of the ICBM would obliterate London.  Our Hero saves the day.  The movie was so far from the book that the studio actually had a novelization written so there would be a book at least remotely close to the movie.    The novel version of Hugo Drax does show up eventually, kinda-sorta, as Max Zorin in A View to a Kill.  They're even introduced in a similar way.  In the novel Moonraker, the story begins with M asking Bond to look into famed industrialist Drax's cheating at bridge.  In A View to a Kill, Bond starts looking into Zorin in part because Zorin's cheating at horse racing.    Sadly, the novel Moonraker does not include Grace Jones."

TrueFilm,39c4jc,RyanSmallwood,14,Thu Jun 11 04:36:22 2015 UTC,"Great work, I find acclimating ones-self to 1910s films can be a very rewarding experience.  Even if the filmmaking seems primitive at times, often the way the actors are placed in the frame is done very carefully to focus the viewers attention on what important rather than with close ups and editing (especially in European films that were slower to adapt continuity editing seen in American films from the time).  Here are some of my favorite films from the decade.  Benjamin Christensen is especially interesting for his early use of single source high contrast lighting effects.  Yevgeni Bauer has some wonderful example of long dolly shots unlike anything else from this time period.  Robert Reinert's Nerven has some great pre-expressionist acting as well as pre-Citizen Kane composition in depth.  And Abel Gance starts his rapid editing experiments in J'Accuse that reach their apex in his 1923 film, La Roue.  Plus if you're a fan of Ernst Lubitsch's hollywood films, you'll find his early silent have the same energy and humor right from the beginning, and are probably the most fun 1910 films I've seen.   Fantomas (Lous Feuillade, 1913, France) Mysterious X (Benjamin Christensen, 1914, Denmark) Cabiria (Giovanni Pastrone, 1914, Italy) Les Vampyres (Louis Feuillade, 1915, France) After Death (Yevgeni Bauer, 1915, Russia) Regeneration (Raoul Walsh, 1915, US) Night of Revenge (Benjamin Christensen, 1916, Denmark) Il Fuoco (Giovanni Pastrone, 1916, Italy) The Dying Swan (Yevgeni Bauer, 1917, Russia) A Man There Was (Victor Sjöström, 1917, Sweden) I Don’t Want to be a Man (Ernst Lubitsch, 1918, Germany) The Outlaw and his Wife (Victor Sjöström, 1918, Sweden) The President (Carl Theodor Dreyer, 1919, Denmark) J’Accuse! (Abel Gance, 1919, France) The Oyster Princess (Ernst Lubitsch, 1919, Germany) The Doll (Ernst Lubitsch, 1919, Germany) Nerven (Robert Reinert, 1919, Germany) Sir Arne’s Treasure (Mauritz Stiller, 1919, Sweden) Blind Husbands (Erich von Stroheim, 1919, US)"
TrueFilm,39c4jc,RyanSmallwood,5,Thu Jun 11 00:34:35 2015 UTC,"A lot of these are already on my list for a second pass through the decade--though I doubt I'll be watching them exclusively at that time. I did see two chapters of Les Vampyres and loved the slow build of it. It would be interesting to see David Fincher do a modern take on the story. With only a month to get in a whole decade, it seemed a bit greedy to give 6 hours of viewing time to one film though."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,whitemonochrome,2,Thu Jun 11 01:54:25 2015 UTC,"If you enjoyed the first two episodes of Les Vampires, I think you'll find finishing the series a very rewarding experience as the plot really picks up steam during the middle episodes.  Though I agree with your specific experiment its probably better to get a wider survey of the films from this period than to devote so much time to a single style.  The French film industry at this time wasn't as strong as countries like Italy, Sweden, Denmark, and America, which is why Les Vampires relies on serialization and sinister sounding episode titles to make sure its audience keeps getting pulled back in.  But Louis Feuillade also shows just how much you can do with some basic sets, a static camera and few insert shots."

Reading how you can see the birth of things that echo into contemporary films almost gives me goosebumps.    As you get further into the century and film production begins to expand, how are you going to go about picking 30ish films?"
TrueFilm,39c4jc,FoulObelisk,21,Wed Jun 10 20:41:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kudos. There is amazing stuff pre-50s and I've felt like a dude spending his afternoon the attic shouting ""Hey everybody, look at this super cool stuff!"" The idea that I move forward a decade every mont is basically what's been getting me through tough spots. I started the project super excited to get to the 70s and within 2 weeks I was much more excited to get to sound films in the 30s. Now that film is getting a bit more established, I'm making my selections based on a super simple algorithm of averaging the top 20 most popular films per year according www.letterboxd.com which is an amazing site if anyone isn't on it, with the highest grossing films of each year according to Wikipedia. (#1 on a list gives a film 20 points, #20 gives a film 1 point.) The Top 10 scoring films are must sees then I cherry pick from the top 50 any bonus films.

TrueFilm,39c4jc,seanziewonzie,8,Wed Jun 10 21:18:25 2015 UTC,"I'll take the 30s and 50s over the 70s. 1937-1960 is pretty much the peak creative period for American film.  Relying on the consensus of what's other people are already watching is interesting. That's going to divert you to a lot of historically/technically/culturally significant films but not necessarily 'good' or 'worth seeing' ones. Especially for silent film, because very few of them are still commercialized, unlike even many of the earliest sound films. Also, couldn't you figure this out just by sorting films by year through letterboxd itself?"
TrueFilm,39c4jc,lordhadri,16,Wed Jun 10 21:31:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know man. Aside from some solid Hitchcock and European films, the 40s especially are a time in film history rendered culturally bereft by government interference and committees bent on turning film into nothing more than a propaganda tool. I'll give it up to the 50s for all the great international films, but after the rise of the 30s, American film had to wait for the 70s before it really started making art that meant something. Maybe I'll change my mind after getting through those months though."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,seanziewonzie,11,Wed Jun 10 22:11:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, I think you will. Censorship was a huge issue, but to say that film was made less artistically significant is way too strong of a statement considering most people think of that as the Golden Era of American cinema.  Even just hitting the films from the AFI list for those decades will probably change your mind: Citizen Kane, The Third Man, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The Searchers, Sunset Boulevard, On the Waterfront, 12 Angry Men, etc., etc.   There were some exceptional films created in that time period, and I think the chronological perspective you're holding yourself to will really reinforce how important that time period was."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,lordhadri,11,Thu Jun 11 00:16:13 2015 UTC,"The 30s and 40s were dominated by Mexican cinema. It's what people call The Golden Age of Cinema in Mexico. I'd recommend you look it up, there's some real gems during that time, truly fantastic films."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,lordhadri,5,Thu Jun 11 03:09:23 2015 UTC,"I also have to disagree with lordhadri. Can you imagine what films like Red River or The Big Sleep could have been without the restrictive atmosphere of filmmaking?  I say we are currently at the best period in filmmaking, only because the newest crop of filmmakers seem to be a sincere generation with diverse life philosophies and a love for film and art that towers above any desire to ""make it"". Say what you want about the artfulness of Citizen Kane and Taxi Driver or anything else, but even after films were let loose by the government and the studio wariness, there was still this sense that films were being pressured by mass-audience expectation. Today I don't see that.  Could Wendy and Lucy have been made any other decade? Or Hunger? Could we have bred such happy, confident filmmakers? And outside of Reichardt and McQueen, we have Sofia Coppola, Lynne Ramsey, Wes Anderson, Spike Jonze, Richard Linklater, Michel Gondry, Lars Von Trier and the rejuvenated with i-dont-give-a-fuck careers of Paul Thomas Anderson and Spike Lee.   In the future, we're going to have some wonderful filmographies to look back on."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,lordhadri,4,Thu Jun 11 10:36:00 2015 UTC,"I also don't know why you're giving Taxi Driver a hard time when that's exactly the sort of film right-wing censors would destroy if they could.  Several of the directors you mentioned don't primarily make commercial American movies anyway. The rest would have done fine or even better in other eras.  It seems that censorship doesn't necessarily stifle creativity. It can keep movies from depicting alternative values or certain groups of people in the open, but isn't the biggest thing that prevents films from being 'good.' The Best Picture winner from 1940 is blatantly about lesbians. Such a film could not win the award today, probably because someone would complain just like they did about Gone Girl. You don't need official censors to make filmmakers averse to offending the audience."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,abrightersummerday,2,Thu Jun 11 13:32:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about subject material. I'm talking about the need to make a big ol' complete story that the audience will leave the theater believing ""based on what my idea of what a movie should be, this was a good movie"" and direct important scenes in the same old ways to maximize that feeling. That's why I brought up Wendy and Lucy and not Nymphomaniac.  There were directors like this before, of course. Herzog, Tati, Watkins, Godard.... Even early Scorsese, with Mean Streets and Who's That Knocking on My Door?. (BTW, I love Taxi Driver. It was just an example of how even the best movies were always made to have a sort of ""moviesness"" that was deemed ""necessary).  Anyway, all I'm saying is that there are more and more successful directors like this today, and it makes me very very happy with the state of the artform."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,lordhadri,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:12:40 2015 UTC,"OK, I know better what you mean....the exact quality of 'movie-ness' is what's often missing these days though, seems like CGI is the new movie-ness. Sure, I like the aesthetic experimentation these days fine, but the ones that do that aren't automatically better. (Wendy and Lucy would definitely not be my choice of a good example.) Same goes for commercial blockbusters self consciously trying to be different."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,RyanSmallwood,0,Thu Jun 11 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I was unfair in my original comment. I prefer the 70s to the 40s not because of the 40s lack of craft, but because the social values of the time limited what the films could express. I am in awe of Wilder, Hitchcock, and Ford, but I agree with seanziewonzie. My personal taste in film sways toward outright spectacle or the closest truth that can be reached through an artistic lense. The glossed over truth of American films of the 40s does not appeal to me because of that. But again, I'll be able to speak about it more intelligently and maybe even change my tone once I've gone through a whole month of watching 40s films."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,abrightersummerday,2,Thu Jun 11 14:31:13 2015 UTC,"Can you imagine what films like Red River or The Big Sleep could have been without the restrictive atmosphere of filmmaking?   Not as good, becuase those two are perfect the way they are."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,RyanSmallwood,4,Thu Jun 11 13:04:11 2015 UTC,"Even if that was true, the importance of 'the 1970s' and what New Hollywood stood for is over-exaggerated. Sure the stuff from the 1940s that still gets watched is mostly major commercial films but that's what was good about them; just looking at the top 60 on letterboxd, there's a terrific amount of integrity on display. Brazenly 'pre-Code' early sound films weren't necessarily any better. Two of the few Best Picture winners I consider masterpieces also happen to come from the 1940s.  And it's not like watching movies from the 1970s is all about revisiting a period when artists were supposedly unencumbered by censorship and commercialism. I see Jaws, Alien and Star Wars are right up in the top 10 with Taxi Driver. You have to look at the next page of 60 on letterboxd to see F for Fake, McCabe&Mrs. Miller, Fear Eats the Soul, Cabaret, All That Jazz, Fantastic Planet, and In the Realm of the Senses.   As to propaganda, I suppose you could say that about Casablanca and The Stranger, but Day of Wrath and Notorious are right there next to them. And give me A Matter of Life and Death over Apocalypse Now any day. ANY day."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,jam66539,3,Thu Jun 11 01:50:43 2015 UTC,"It seems like this is more pointing out a flaw in OP's methodology for choosing which films to watch, rather than revealing a weakness in any particular decade. The greatness of 70's American cinema is probably overstated, and also probably suffers from a presentist aesthetic bias (just old enough to feel classic, just modern enough to feel comfortable), BUT... there were also just a ton of great films in that decade. And yeah, many of them won't float to the top with the Gross + Letterbox method."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,jam66539,4,Thu Jun 11 05:08:41 2015 UTC,"You're right, I got carried away a little. It's not that the 1970s aren't good, but if we think of it in terms of the letterboxd top 60 of every decade, it doesn't look that much better/different from the following decades. ;) I think my real problem is that when people say 'the 1970s' they really just mean The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. And whatever becomes the most popular of an era ends up occluding everything else, even if it happens to be dramatic auteur pictures for that decade.   For some reason the 1970s seems to be the terminus of cultural relevance, most people don't seem to care about anything beyond that except for two Kubrick movies and Psycho. Perhaps it's associated with America cultural milestones since there's sort of 'before' 1969 and 'after' 1969 in everyone's minds. (As it happens, 1969 is one of the worst years for film ever.) Everything else is now niche films that only cinephiles watch/buy. I wonder if that extends indefinitely or we'll finally have a new generation that doesn't really care for the auteur films of the 70s followed by the blockbusters and comedies of the 80s. I never lived in those decades and almost all the new movies feel like remakes or commentary on the movies of those eras."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,RyanSmallwood,3,Thu Jun 11 06:09:55 2015 UTC,"I can't remember which director was being quoted, but I believe one of the French New Wave directors talked about American Movies after the 1960s and how much the quality deteriorated, saying it wasn't so much that there weren't great films being made, just that it used to be that 80% of all American films were good, and suddenly it became 20%.  That's what sometimes gets lost when just watching the masterpieces of each decade. The great films of the 1940s go really deep thanks to the strength of the studio system from this era.  Once you get past the top 100 or whatever greatest films of the 1940s, there's actually a ton more of great films to explore. In later decades there were definitely important innovations happening, but there wasn't necessarily the same thriving film industry beyond them."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,sjarrel,2,Thu Jun 11 11:08:40 2015 UTC,"This brings to mind another way that I think lordhadri is both right and wrong (as are you). The depth of 'quality' films probably is greater in the 1940's because of the studio system. But this is only if you're looking at films in terms of the crispness of writing and composition, the flawlessness of the lighting, the seamlessness of the editing. For the most part, the studios didn't make ""bad"" pictures because the studio had so many layers of quality control. And of course many of those films are good as well as ""good"". Later eras perhaps had more truly bad films, which is a side effect of greater freedom. Creative freedom is the freedom to create meritless garbage.  But isn't it also true that later eras (really gathering steam in the 70's) blasted open what was possible in cinema, both in terms of style (pushback against studio hegemony) and content (pushback against state/studio censorship)? I really haven't seen deep enough into any era to argue this with a lot of authority, but it feels like while the studio system gave us depth and consistency (""tradition of quality"" maybe? though I'm using this in some ways counter to Truffaut... but mostly the same), the cultural liberation of the late 60's onward gave us breadth and radical experimentation.   It also definitely depends how much we're centering this conversation around American cinema, and also how much we're centering it around Hollywood. The argument I'm talking about above mostly pertains to Hollywood-backed films. I mean, Maya Deren was active in the 40's, so any serious conversation about diversity of style and radical experimentation is pointless if we have to account for the boundlessness of human creativity, beyond what's canonized and commercially viable.  To me it seems the standard narrative is about right: First we had crude experimentation and a cinema of spectacle; then we had the development of narrative film alongside fairly radical experimentation (which has a lot more to do with the newness of the medium than any political/cultural considerations), then the narrative form and studio systems coalesced, coinciding with a very repressed cultural/political climate in the U.S., then the culture opened up and the studio system began to disintegrate simultaneously, then the ""New Hollywood"" bubble burst (which didn't really put the toothpaste back in the tube, but just changed who got how much money under which conditions), we got blockbusters, then the breakout of ""indie"" film (which existed all along, but finally became profitable for more adventurous studio heads to co-opt), and then on into the current era, which I guess hasn't been defined yet.  That seems about right to me. If it seems like anyone is pretending that cinema didn't exist before 1970, it's probably because Reddit skews toward 20 year-olds who are scared of black-and-white, silence, and unfamiliar speaking cadences. All these eras are pretty great on their own terms."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,ShutUpWoodsie,2,Fri Jun 12 00:27:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, so far no one has come up with a film industry that gives everyone who wants to be a filmmaker unlimited creative control and resources to create as many films as they want any way they want until become really great at their craft. Lots of different film industries throughout history have their own interesting properties that make their output unique from other systems of making film.  And its always interesting to see how various creative and motivated individuals navigate and thrive in these different conditions."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,lordhadri,7,Fri Jun 12 00:59:01 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but the good pre-world war 1 films are actually really easy to watch if you put your mind to it. Lots of the early Griffith and Melies films are less than 10 minutes, so if you don't like the one you're watching, you can move onto something else in no time. If you haven't seen anything from this early era I would recommend Death's Marathon (1913) by D.W. Griffith (mostly for the editing in its last few minutes), and if you want to go back even further how about The Haunted Castle (1896!) by Melies to see some of the world's earliest movie magic! Also, the Edison shorts can be pretty interesting too. I tend to use them as a pre or post movie watching activity, or if I'm too short on time for a feature film.  All that being said, I definitely agree an entire month of this era seems pretty daunting since I still haven't even managed to make time for any of the epics from the 10's yet (Cabiria, Intolerance, Birth of a Nation etc.),  Edit: Used the wrong bracket on the Edison short films youtube link"
TrueFilm,39c4jc,Stylobean,10,Wed Jun 10 21:39:03 2015 UTC,"The Haunted Castle is AMAZING! What was super awesome last month when I did 1880-1909 was seeing Melies not only introduce the idea of using film as a narrative tool in a time when it was essentially a photographic novelty, but SINGLE HANDEDLY NAILING the horror genre, the sci fi genre, and the fantasy genre right off the bat. It all begins with Melies."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,lordhadri,5,Wed Jun 10 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree, Melies is Incredible. Its funny, because in my head I always thought the development of film was a lot slower and more gradual, like a decade or so of just recording people moving, a decade of stageplay types of things, then introducing some editing techniques, and so on and so forth. Not only was I wrong, but then I stumble onto Melies  who comes in right away with set design, props, editing and visual effects that would be tough to pull off in any era, let alone pre-1900! Check out One Man Band if you haven't yet. Its only about a minute long, but I love how confidently he can pull off effects like that, in an era before anyone else was even trying."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,Stylobean,5,Wed Jun 10 22:31:09 2015 UTC,"Fans of George Melies should also check out the films of Segundo de Chomón, like The Red Spectre.  He definitely copies a lot of Melies' tricks, but also achieves some really impressive new effects of his own, and was also responsible for some of the special effects and camerawork on Cabiria."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,seanziewonzie,5,Thu Jun 11 10:58:44 2015 UTC,"I loved getting a taste of Chomon's 1900s films. The House of Ghosts was such a great example of paying homage to and growing from a past film maker. I didn't know that about Cabiria That guy was a champion. As long as we're shouting out 1900s directors too: James Williamson basically laid out film narrative in non fantasy settings WAY before Griffith. He only made 7 or 8 short films, but they are all mind blowing for their time."

TrueFilm,39c4jc,hipsterparalegal,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:33:58 2015 UTC,Were scifi and fantasy distinct from one another at the time?
TrueFilm,39c4jc,mellowship,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:52:16 2015 UTC,"I think so. If you watch Melies' Kingdom of the Fairies or Cendrillon or plenty of others, there's a general whimsy that is also present in the fantastic planets visited by Melies' protagonists in his sci fi films. What sets Journey to the Moon and Impossible Voyage apart is the way they set up the rules and reality of the fantastical expeditions. Films were barely over 20 minutes at the time and every frame really counted, to say nothing of the extra production cost, so to take the time to show people planning the trip and setting off on it just to lend a sense of realism to the films was huge. Fantasy is a genre we can get lost in as an audience. Science Fiction is one where--if pulled off right--we can fantasize that MAYBE it could happen. George Melies--at least visually--was the first to separate those two experiences."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,RyanSmallwood,8,Fri Jun 12 04:05:31 2015 UTC,"There seem not to be a lot of good resources that point us toward silent features that are enjoyable, watchable movies as opposed to the ones that are considered milestones in the evolution of film for some reason. These don't always overlap and the usual Classics/See it before you die sorts of lists over-emphasize the latter type as the best early silent film has to offer."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,MagnusRobot,12,Wed Jun 10 21:14:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been diving a bit into this stuff myself, and it seems the farther back you go, the less info the internet has and the less organized it is.  Even including where to find these films; sure, the big popular ones get blurays by Kino or Cohen Media, but that constitutes very few.   All these films are public domain,  and I wish these were what people were setting up torrents for, but  sadly there doesn't seem to be as much interest in this stuff.  Imagine a legal torrent site where you could, say, grab all the available shorts of Melies in the best public domain prints available, as a package. And that had all these other silents, and old serials, organized and available.  (I'm aware of the Internet Archive for PD stuff, and that's great, but it's not the be-all end-all.)"

TrueFilm,39c4jc,JurijFedorov,8,Thu Jun 11 13:48:05 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested if you could reflect on your decision to group by decade. Did you learn anything? Seems to me like we automatically associate trends in art over time, in America in the 20th century, with the decades, when the trends might more accurately match up with other changes in society, or not have as strong a connection to society as we think. For example, how would your project be different if you went by 1915-1925, 1925-1935, etc."
TrueFilm,39c4jc,JurijFedorov,7,Thu Jun 11 02:43:13 2015 UTC,"There are a number of happy coincidences that make the study of film history by decade work out surprisingly well.  The switch from shorts to feature films early on in the 1910s.  The end of WWII in 1918 and the modernist experiments with different modes of filmmaking in the early 1920s (German Expressionism, French Impressionism, etc.).  The Great Depression and the dominance of sound cinema in 1930.  And the number of New Waves that began springing up in the 1960s starting with the French New Wave at the beginning of the decade alongside of other narrative experiments like Antonioni's L'Avventura in 1960.  Now of course these things don't always line up 100% perfectly, there are some sound films at the tail of the 1920s, and some countries, like the Soviet Union and Japan, were making silent masterpieces well into the 1930s.  Tons of films textbooks will discuss the 30s, 40s, and 50s as pre-war and post-war cinema rather than by decade, and books on individual countries film histories may choose different grouping systems that better fit that countries particular history.  But still if you're going to choose an arbitrary grouping system to look at world film history, the standard decades one is a pretty nice one."
TrueFilm,39dda8,elbitjusticiero,4,Thu Jun 11 00:30:33 2015 UTC,"I'm amazed nobody's mentioned this already, but in Apocalypse Now Brando recites parts of T.S. Eliot's The Hollow Men.  What's really interesting here is that the poem's epigram (""Mistah Kurtz--he dead"") is itself taken from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, which serves as the inspiration for Apocalypse Now.  In that sense, the poem serves not only to emphasize Kurtz's disillusionment with American military policy in Vietnam, but also subtly reconnects the film to its source material."
TrueFilm,39dda8,attackofthesam,5,Fri Jun 12 15:43:21 2015 UTC,"Blending a poem into the film has always got an unexpected impact that differs from one film to another. So the effect of the poem in Tarkovsky's ""The mirror"" is nowhere near the same as it is in, say, ""Before Sunrise"" where Ethan Hawke's character reads a passage from a W. H. Auden poem. From what I remember there is also a poem in ""Interstellar""."
TrueFilm,39dda8,wiseasszarathustra,5,Thu Jun 11 03:10:14 2015 UTC,"I had forgotten about Interstellar's use of Dylan Thomas, surely because I didn't think it really fit... The poem is pretty clearly about death and decay, and though the theme of the movie has to do with that in a sideways manner, the place and context where it's used sounds to me more like a misuse, hinging upon the superficial relationship between night and sideral space.   EDIT: Thomas, not Auden.   EDIT 2: What a feat. I've been downvoted in a subreddit where it is literally impossible to be downvoted."
TrueFilm,39dda8,hrgilbert,3,Fri Jun 12 15:51:16 2015 UTC,"Well I think one can contextualize a poem to find a new meaning, and I think a poem's meaning can change over time. It may be the case that Auden wrote it about death, but that doesn't mean someone can't reimagine it in the context of space exploration or human perseverance (which is what I think the poem is really about)."
TrueFilm,39dda8,elmurko,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:55:00 2015 UTC,"Uhm, you might be right in that interpretation. Anyway your point stands that recontextualizing the poem can give it unexpected meanings..."
TrueFilm,39dda8,FoulObelisk,4,Fri Jun 12 19:36:52 2015 UTC,"The Grey has a great poem in it, which is surprising. That movie a textbook example of how the wrong type of ads and marketing strategy can ruin a movie. The trailer billed it as a typical hollywood no brain action thriller and it turned out to be a beautiful film that had some depth. I love movies that surprised me and this one definitely did.   Anyways the poem in the movie is great. It definitely adds to the movie and helps bring the whole film and its message together."
TrueFilm,39dda8,MahoganyLover,3,Thu Jun 11 07:35:05 2015 UTC,"You should look into The Dark Side of The Heart (1992) by Eliseo Subiela. It's an Argentinian film with poems by Mario Benedetti and Oliverio Girondo (the fictionalized version of Oliverio being the protagonist of the film). It's really interesting, jaw-droppingly surreal and outstandingly crafted. All the dialogue is mostly poems from Benedetti and Girondo, which I'm sure you'll enjoy."

TrueFilm,39dda8,halfajack,3,Thu Jun 11 03:35:46 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy hearing poetry within film, i find it gives it an extra layer of meaning and really just combines two art forms, that compliment each other well. Most recently I loved the use of Dylan Thomas' Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night in Interstellar. It was used effectively as a metaphor and Nolan uses many literally illusions in the film overall. I feel the use of poems in film gives the same effect as spoken word with the addition of moving images, it all just provokes stronger emotions and feelings but also makes the audience think deeper. Also I find it's used when images alone cannot quite convey an exact sentiment between characters or situations, that a filmmaker would want images to do, thats where out language, specifically poems can help out.(I think)"
TrueFilm,39dda8,sickaduck,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:06:18 2015 UTC,"While I didn't particularly like the use of this poem in Interstellar (see my reply to the other comment above/below), I think you're right in saying that language goes where images can't... of course the inverse is also true, I could spend ten years describing a single frame of After life and would be nowhere near to conveying the same effect. ;)"
TrueFilm,399j05,yarbs90,15,Wed Jun 10 05:55:25 2015 UTC,"Very nice write up. Two things that you didn't mention that I want to is in Lady Vengeance and they are more just quick observations. The first is the shot of the couples of the children when they first walk into the classroom and you get those quick shots of them and how they will react to the videos in a few minutes. Those shots always stuck out to me as a very interesting way to introduce characters. The other thing was how the money came up as it was played so naturally and while the protagonist seems to find this odd she also seems to understand. That was it, just two minor things that stuck out to me."
TrueFilm,399j05,arandompurpose,2,Wed Jun 10 11:46:55 2015 UTC,I would also add that it seems glossed over that the parents don't all indulge in revenge and some can't stomach it at all. I think that carries through the thenes of the film that vengeance isn't necessarily cathartic' even with someone as horrible as Baek.
TrueFilm,39a4z0,Felnir,23,Wed Jun 10 10:21:15 2015 UTC,"Horror is probably the most subjective genre in existence. It's evidenced by Imdb greatly. If a horror movie gets a 7.0, it's a miracle. Now I've actually been on the hunt for good recent horror movies and trust me, there are plenty out there. For one I don't think people should discount a movie because it's ""unoriginal."" Horror has very established sub genres and it's difficult to pull a new trick that isn't already in the book. I'm mot bothered however because i look at the quality of the movie itself.   I'd like to talk about The Conjuring to illustrate my point. Right off the bat I'll say I'm a tough scare and it wasn't the scariest movie I've ever seen. Many regard it as overrated but I disagree. Now the movie lacks almost any originality or fresh ideas, it has jumpscares and is very old school, but the reason it's so adored is because it is a quality movie. It's very well made on a technical level and if you like me are able to get past the fact it's premise has been done before, you'll actually see that it's one of the best movies of its kind. I don't seek new ideas all the time, I seek for a movie that executes it's premise well. I'll be reviewing it later this week and I will emphasise at how genuinely good it is and how people should stop comparing it to movies that have come out decades ago.   James Wan is for me a director who understands horror very well. He knows both how to make quality movies (Dead Silence is possibly the exception) and have them be appealing to a lot of people. He is great with a camera, hires great composers, and has a heavy reliance on makeup, prosthetics and practical effects. Some people dislike his movies because of jumpscares, but those are essential in most horror movies. He earns every single jumpscares (apart from maybe 3-4 in his movies overall) and they are genuinely unsettling. He doesn't abuse them and is able to build tension very well. Saw, Insidious (2) & The Conjuring are all at a very high standard despite some of their flaws.  Then you have what people complain about the most: found footage. This is probably my biggest pet peeve but again there are some genuinely good movies that use the gimmick. The Blair Witch Project has been called a snoozefest by some but that is purely subjective. The method adds a lot of atmosphere to the movie and it is is a landmark in the genre. Paranormal Activity 1 was also unique (I hate the sequels bitterly however) in how it was able to create tension using very little. Unfriended I hear was pretty good as well. Even Mark Kermode enjoyed it.  Then you have French New Wave. Martyrs, Inside, High Tension and Frontieres  (haven't the latter 3) are also gaining quite popular and I haven't heard complaints about anything not pertaining to their brutality. They are very niche movies but I'm a fan of Martyrs and I belive the others follow in its trail.  Then you have a couple outliers like The Ring (Gore Verbinski adapted it very well), Let the Right One In  (Also recommend the American remake), the Babadook which was very clever, and a dozen or so more.  It's a genre filled with crap but there are good movies aplenty in it. I've crafted a list for myself to see over the summer and I'm sure there are a couple gems in there.  The reason it's so bloated is very simple. Money. Horror is insanely cheap with enormous profit margin that come even with recycled ideas as teenagers are always up for a frightfest. PA1 was made on 15k USD and grossed 190mil. Blair Witch was 22.5k and made almost 250mil. This prompts big studios to hire first time directors on derivative projects that are definite money makes. Found Footage is cheap, everyone fears the occult, jumpscares give a good jolt and no one is really expecting much anyway. You don't need good actors to scream for you. To me Ouija and PA3 are the best examples of what people see when they have a look at horror. Recycled trash made by big studios. You don't have to dig very far however to find good stuff.  Edit: Please be so kind and not downvote this thread. It happens so often here and I'm sure OP genuinely wants so answers."
TrueFilm,39a4z0,TrumanB-12,7,Wed Jun 10 13:25:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I came here specifically to talk about James Wan. He revolutionized the industry, for better or for worse, with Saw, which is a very good movie in its own right and doesn't deserve the reputation that the sequels garnered it. And then he did the Insidious movies, which are, for my money, some of the most original stuff in recent horror. Not to mention Conjuring, which was okay as far as I'm concerned, but it was successful and that's what matters. He's done very good things for bringing back some respect to the genre."

Frontiers is probably the least ""serious"" of them. It takes an average horror movie set up and makes it brutal. Also has one of my favorite death scenes of all time. Inside is shot so well. It has another simple premise but it's delivery and unapologetic use of violence is superb. Martyrs tho stands above the others. I have never seen more discussion after watching a movie than I have watching it with different groups. I think it is most successful in that it is deeply disturbing, makes you feel filthy, but in the scheme of the film never feels unnecessary.  That being said, none of those movies are particularly new. Has anything of the same tone come out of France in recent years? I haven't heard of or seen anything.   Another foreign horror that I love and hope to throw out is I Saw The Devil"
TrueFilm,39a4z0,TheDaltonXP,2,Thu Jun 11 15:30:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm i can think of Strange Colour of Your Body's Tears but that's more surrealist horror. That was 2011 however. Good point actually, I can't think of much."
TrueFilm,39a4z0,TrumanB-12,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:46:20 2015 UTC,"See, I'm of a different opinion on James Wan. While he's indisputably good at what he does, and is great at creating tension and atmosphere, I find his films rather emotionally empty. They seem like vessels for scares, rather than an interesting story. I find watching his movies very similar to riding a theme park ride. I'm much more partial to films with a bit more meat on their bones, like Let the Right One In.  Another movie that I feel the need to bring up even though it's not super recent, is Lake Mungo. Please try and give it a watch if you can find it. On the surface it looks like a pretty by-the-numbers mockumentary, but it's actually exceedingly subtle, and an amazing meditation on loss, coping, and the legacies that the dead leave behind.  Also does A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night count as a horror film? Either way, it's worth watching."
TrueFilm,39a4z0,trip9,2,Thu Jun 11 15:12:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with your points on James Wan, I find his rewatch value goes down on Insidious and The Conjuring, but I feel he has taken the horror genre in a new movement with his trademark techniques and characters. That's not necessarily a bad thing because it's better than ALOT of the other stuff out there. However his films have a thing for producing annoying sequels and spin offs.. now that IS a bad thing."
TrueFilm,39a4z0,TrumanB-12,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:11:09 2015 UTC,"As much as I love him, I do have to agree with you. Consider however that Let The Right One In, while technically a horror movie, is not exactly frightening. It's a very clear divide between the stories horror movies tell. Either you scare or you evoke deep emotions. I dunno if there are many movies that do both. Maybe Martyrs."
TrueFilm,39a4z0,TrumanB-12,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:44:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply. You touch on some very important points there. What for me is the most interesting thing is the Slasher movies. The beggining of this genre was a little rough because of all its controversy but it was, as you said it, very cheap to make and it succeded at the box office more or less. Mario Bava as a godfather of the genre made some very good movies (A Bay of Blood, Black Sabbath) and was later succeded by Dario Argento (Deep Red, Suspiria) following the same route. The thing got recognized and it came to the West. Some of the directors saw a potential like John Carpenter and Wes Craven and made movies that are nowdays considered classics such as Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street.  Nowdays slasher movies are made for as little money as possible just to get some profit at the box office. They were made for even less money back in the day but they had quality. And they were made with some heart put into them. Now I am not saying everything is lost and there are no good slasher movies anymore, just look at the Evil Dead remake, I found it very decent and very well made movie.  Regarding your edit: I dont think it is really improtant if people upvote or downvote this thread, I wanted a discussion and that is what I got, so works for me :)"
TrueFilm,39a4z0,Lululeruealr,2,Wed Jun 10 15:09:13 2015 UTC,The slasher genre has been dying out. There aren't many releases at all. I can think of You're Next and maybe 3 others that have gotten any recognition but supernatural and occult is all the craze nowadays.   Edit: (Just talking about American releases)
TrueFilm,39a4z0,mantasis,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:30:48 2015 UTC,"Yes its all supernatural and occult now, sadly. Speaking of which, can you please explain why you enjoyed the first Paranormal Activity but hated the rest. Is it solely because they use the same formula or is it because some other aspects of the film? (Just for clarification I have never seen PA, any of them, but I am familiar with what they are about and genre they belong.)"
TrueFilm,39a4z0,SundanceOdyssey,10,Thu Jun 11 20:07:30 2015 UTC,"No one will argue if you say there hasn't been good horror movies lately.   I don't think this is true. I think there are plenty of horror fans who would argue with that.  I loved It Follows, which you mentioned. I really liked The Babadook. I liked the Evil Dead remake (though I still love the originals best, of course) and You're Next. I've heard great things about and am hoping to watch Spring, We Are Still Here, and The Witch all soon. I'm sure there are other recent things I liked a lot that I'm blanking on.   I think the stuff that gets wide releases is often sort of formulaic and made more with the intent of getting the butts of casual movie theatre goers into seats than with the intent of appealing to people who are specifically horror fans, so that's a shame. In the case of both It Follows and The Babadook, they both started out with very small limited releases and then the people behind them decided to take a chance on wide releases due to buzz (and then some horror fans seemed to turn against both of them due to the idea that they're overhyped/overrated), but then there are loads of kind of mediocre horror films that get wide releases right away."
TrueFilm,39a4z0,Didalectic,6,Wed Jun 10 16:13:01 2015 UTC,"The last scary film I saw was [rec]. Haven't found anything scary since. The Babadook, and Evil Dead were good horror movies, technically, but they weren't good based off their horror elements.   It's like someone else said, the genre is insanely subjective. I find it impossible to find anything that I find scary, especially anything that's come out recently..."
TrueFilm,3927ov,bongo1138,46,Mon Jun 8 18:45:37 2015 UTC,"One of the problems with the current trailers strategy is that it is deliberately giving you a ""mini-film"". It's saying: here's the ""micro cut"" of the film, pay up and you can see the ""extended cut"".  If you are making a micro cut, obviously you're going to put all the best bits and turning points in if you can. Because you are no longer selling a mystery. You are giving a taster in order to sell ""more of these scenes"".  Tomorrowland really suffered from this because of the reordering in the trailer; it was a micro cut that mis-sold its extended cut.  Like all things, it'll pass, but it's particularly bad at the moment."
TrueFilm,3927ov,TriumphantGeorge,7,Mon Jun 8 20:58:32 2015 UTC,"That's a really interesting idea...  Do you think it'd be possible that a studio could market a film strictly on the mystery of it's plot, though? I think TOMORROWLAND kind of does this, right? Same with pretty much any J.J. Abrams or Damon Lindeloff movie.  Those guys are keen on making movies that you know as little as possible about going into, and I think PROMETHEUS and CLOVERFIELD and SUPER 8 are all great examples of using the mystery of the movie to generate buzz.   Thank you for responding."
TrueFilm,3927ov,mattcuz83,8,Mon Jun 8 21:06:15 2015 UTC,The Master's trailer is made up of mostly unused footage to give a sense of tone without giving you the film. The shot of Phoenix drawing the revolver in a motel room comes to mind.
TrueFilm,3927ov,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:19:07 2015 UTC,"Do you think it'd be possible that a studio could market a film strictly on the mystery of it's plot, though?    It's been quite common in the past: you might describe the setup, you paint a ""sense"", selected scenes that connect to each other, rather than show a compressed plot. I don't mean mystery=twist, I mean being less literally ""this is what the film is"".  The Prometheus teaser and even main trailer was pretty good - it has its own narrative. I think that's what the best trailer does: it has its own coherence which is representative of the film without directly showing you the film.  It's quite fun to look at the some of the very old trailers. For instance, if you've actually seen The Third Man then the trailer is ridiculous. It's pure ""fantasy of cinema"" selling!  Meanwhile, I recently saw the trailer for Chinatown. Now, it's not sequenced so you get the flavour rather than the meaning - you'd not really suss the plot - but their inclusion of the final line is a bit of a shame! I'm glad I never saw it.  If I get a chance I'll pull a few ""micro cut"" examples.  What is interesting at the moment is that now that online is the main distribution outlet for trailers, it'll be fun to see how it mutates the form. I thought The Martian's little promo film, Ares 3: Farewell was quite a smart approach. What you might call ""context content"" which shows you how they are handling it, without actually giving the movie away. (The characterisation in that little film gives me much more confidence in it.) EDIT: Unfortunately the main trailer is probably quite give-away-ish."
TrueFilm,3927ov,kyle_albasi,2,Mon Jun 8 21:22:32 2015 UTC,"As someone who was completely uninterested in The Martian, the main trailer (which garnered the familiar complaints of revealing too much)  sold me on the movie much more than this ""context content."""
TrueFilm,3927ov,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:27:11 2015 UTC,"That's perhaps a good point: depends on the audience.  As someone who is into sci-fi but tired of by-the-numbers effects efforts, the main trailer seemed quite standard problems-in-space, but the extra video reassured me that it was going to be an actual film-with-characters. Basically, I'm reassured it looks more like Moon and Europa Report and Alien, rather than Prometheus and Last Days on Mars and Event Horizon.  Note: I already knew about the film and about the casting, etc. So I was already ""interested in being interested""."
TrueFilm,3927ov,kyle_albasi,3,Tue Jun 9 17:52:49 2015 UTC,I had about the opposite impression. What I've heard of the book is that the characters are flat and the main (or at least a major) appeal is following the protagonist solve realistic problems of being stranded on mars in a technically feasible way. The main trailer assured me that it could translate into an engaging visual drama. The extra video actually turned me off as it confirmed some of the reservations I had about the characterization (my exposure to Andy Weir's writing has left me feeling he is terrible at dialogue).
TrueFilm,3927ov,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:32:05 2015 UTC,"Right, I've not read the book at all (I now hear that it's in diary form and very tedious). It was the cast and Ridley Scott that got me interested and the ""Apollo 13 to extreme"" idea was fine, but the trailer was starting to make it look more whizz-bang triumph and less serious scientific jeopardy. I was probably coloured a little by the Interstellar experience... so the little promo video reassured me of the ""naturalness"" aspect.  Interesting though... how the trailer/short either helps or hinders depending on what concerns you are bringing to it."
TrueFilm,3927ov,Tsegen,2,Tue Jun 9 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"Not a surprise really. People depend on teasers. People who are more likely to come unto a movie forum can have their appetite whetted by ""Nolan and McConnaughey"" or ""Ridley Scott and Matt Damon"" (or ""Marvel"").  People outside that though? Sell, sell sell.They need more of a taste. In some cases where the film is already set to do well or the concept is seen as strong enough we can be spared some of that. When a film is particularly insecure it's even worse. Compare Avengers to the new Terminator"
TrueFilm,3927ov,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:09:16 2015 UTC,"For sure. This is a business, after all. It can be slightly soul-destroying though, the trailer thing vs the effort made to manage information in the film itself."
TrueFilm,3927ov,BobaFetted,103,Tue Jun 9 09:14:41 2015 UTC,"I believe just as there is an art to creating films, there is an art to cutting trailers for them. You want to convey the tone of the film without giving too much away. So many trailers these days ruin parts of the film, or give away too much. The last good trailer I saw was Mad Max: Fury Road. It was exciting and vague, and quickly cut, which emulates the rush that the film gives you (That was also the last good film I saw in theaters). I'm getting pretty sick of trailers nowadays. I want trailers to try harder. They're sloppier than ever. That being said, I love a good trailer. When I find a good one I am sometimes prone to rewatching it online...a lot. But I agree the best place to see em is in theaters. Getting the full effect of it."
TrueFilm,3927ov,BobaFetted,12,Mon Jun 8 19:53:12 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree with that notion. There are so many trailers that are great, even overshadow the movie they're advertising. MAD MAX comes to mind, yes.   Do you think there's a reason they give so much away though? I kind of wonder if they're seeing a bigger return on movies with trailers which give away the major plot points.  Thank you for responding."
TrueFilm,3927ov,keyboredcats,12,Mon Jun 8 20:54:07 2015 UTC,"I've heard theories that they give too much away because the studio isn't very confident in the film, so to really sell it they show the biggest twists or money shots of the film."
TrueFilm,3927ov,hivejumper,7,Mon Jun 8 20:59:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think I remember reading somewhere that trailers which show more plot, tend to help movies more than trailers which don't. I can understand that, I guess."
TrueFilm,3927ov,Lyingfigure,6,Mon Jun 8 21:02:07 2015 UTC,"By the time you realize that everything cool in the movie was already in the trailer, you already bought your ticket.  So it doesn't really matter that the studios blow their load in the trailer if it gets you into the theater."
TrueFilm,3927ov,Fgge,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:09:31 2015 UTC,Yep this. And the fact that the drop-off percentage from opening week to week 2 or week 3 can dip 60% or more. All they care about is getting butts in the seats on opening weekend so they give you everything  in the trailers to entice you.
TrueFilm,3927ov,mwich,6,Thu Jun 11 05:03:12 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I saw the comment's score after I read the first sentence. And thanks to that and you I now know I should avoid the trailer. I was reminded of the trailer, after not watching it earlier today on the front page, when I watched the news, because they had a short segment regarding it since Axel Hennie is in the movie (Norway's favourite cirklejerk subject) and only because of this."
TrueFilm,3927ov,bd1941,8,Tue Jun 9 00:16:01 2015 UTC,"In the 80's and 90's trailers literally had voice over describing the entire plot of the film. Trailers do give away a lot, but they're nowhere near as bad as they used to be."
TrueFilm,3927ov,Bonzai-the-jewelz,5,Mon Jun 8 21:24:06 2015 UTC,Have you seen the first trailer for Black Mass? I think it does everything right a trailer can make right and I don´t need to see any other trailer for the movie. This trailer got me hooked instantly.   Here it is.
TrueFilm,3927ov,BobaFetted,2,Tue Jun 9 00:22:55 2015 UTC,"They used to tell the story in a suspense way, not by giving up the whole story. If you take for example, 'Psycho', [Psycho spoiler] the trailer is all about that young woman who dies in the beginning of the movie, and it looks like she's in the entire movie; which isn't the case.  Today -mainly- you don't have that anymore. It's all about advertising and putting as much action as you can and as much information as you can, because they don't know how to cut anymore. They just NEED to put everything."
TrueFilm,3927ov,lordhadri,10,Tue Jun 9 01:33:11 2015 UTC,"Eh, I didn't find Fury Road's trailer as good as people make it out to be. It wasn't a big offender like countless of trailes these past few years, but I still felt spoiled after watching it.   Many scenes I could easily make out within the film and weren't explored much more than what was shown in the trailer. For example Immortan Joe inside his vault must have been just a second or two longer than what was shown in the film. Same with Furiosa in the desert. The whole pole fight or Max strapped to a car would've been better if it wasn't shown in the trailer. The sandstorm could have been a great surprise for the audience too but a bit of oomph is needed for a trailer, so I can't really blame them for using it in the trailer.   Perhaps it's because everyone was hyped up and the film itself was very good, everyone looks at the trailers with a somewhat rose tinted glasses. For me one of the best trailers was Godzilla's halo jump. They managed to capture a huge tension and show enough of the story without spoiling it and still maintaining things mysterious."
TrueFilm,3927ov,JJTheJetPlane5657,9,Tue Jun 9 02:16:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with you there. But I was still pleasantly surprised by the film, because as crazy as the trailers made it seem, I had thought they showed every big action scene (which is what most films do with their trailers that give away too much), but there was so much more than what we saw in the trailer, which was very satisfying.   And about the Godzilla trailer, truer words have never been spoken. I loved that trailer! I'm a huge Godzilla fan and was before that film or trailer came out, but I think for fans or general audiences, that trailer was extremely intruiging and exciting to see. Because lets be honest, everyone knows who Godzilla is and what he looks like, and regardless of the quality of that actual film, the miniscule tease of the monster was fresh and built anticipation in a way that so many other trailers fail to do."
TrueFilm,3927ov,BobaFetted,3,Tue Jun 9 11:34:22 2015 UTC,I think I only saw the first Mad Max trailer and not the more spoilery final one. So I can confirm your thoughts there. The sandstorm and the doof warrior were wonderful to see the first time without expecting them to show up eventually and I loved that the pole cats don't actually come into play until they end.   Someone pointed out awhile ago that the jump in Godzilla wouldnt have worked as well in the movie as it did with the trailer if they changed the music.
TrueFilm,3927ov,angeleyes9000,-2,Tue Jun 9 13:17:04 2015 UTC,"Mad Max: Fury Road  That was also the last good film I saw in theaters   Have you seen the other ones?  I saw it in theaters and while it was exciting I'm not sure I would say, personally, that I thought it was ""good"".. But I also didn't see any of the other ones, and I was very confused about what was going on."
TrueFilm,3927ov,LeRocket,4,Tue Jun 9 19:54:08 2015 UTC,"I have seen the others. The story doesnt really connect, Fury Road stands on its own, but the atmosphere and the world it takes place in really correlates. So seeing the others helps in terms of understanding and accepting the quirkiness and style of the films and the wasteland, but the story stands on its own, and is really different (except for Max, his car, his gun, and some of his mind), so it isn't necessary to see the old ones beforehand."
TrueFilm,3927ov,readedit,3,Mon Jun 8 23:57:17 2015 UTC,I understand what you mean but how many times have you seen the film? I felt really conflicted about whether or not I liked or loved the movie after the first time I saw it. It was hard to recall even one complete sequence because every single scene was so overwhelming. I've seen it four times since and it has gotten better each time. I recommend you watch it a couple more times. I love it so much now that I can't remember the last time I was this obsessed with a movie. (Under the Skin was close last year. Couldn't stop thinking about that film for a month)
TrueFilm,3927ov,LeRocket,30,Tue Jun 9 00:18:12 2015 UTC,"I do everything that I can to avoid trailers.  Seeing a trailer never enhances my pleasure of watching a movie, it can only reduce it.  It's one of the reason that I don't go in theaters anymore (there are exceptions).  Last time I did, I wore a trucker cap and lowered the visor on my eyes during the trailers (that were waayy too long).  Next time I will also listen to something with my headphones, because during the Star Wars trailer I heard some things I preferred not to have heard.  I HATE trailers."
TrueFilm,3927ov,readedit,9,Tue Jun 9 00:43:57 2015 UTC,"Man, something about those STAR WARS trailers though... Too tough for me to ignore! I've been going to a theater that lets me reserve my seats so I can come in right around the time the flick starts.  Thank you for responding."
TrueFilm,3927ov,DjangoBKN,2,Mon Jun 8 22:33:50 2015 UTC,That's interesting. I find that I have zero memory or connections formed from anything I hear in a trailer (I close my eyes during theater trailers).
TrueFilm,3927ov,pdxsean,2,Tue Jun 9 01:51:21 2015 UTC,"I believe you, but just hearing Star Wars SPOILER ruined a little surprise for me, even if (obviously) I had a little doubt!  I really like watching a movie without knowing anything about it.  Especially films like the next Star Wars, which will involve a lot of nostalgia."
TrueFilm,3927ov,kvblinov,2,Tue Jun 9 10:58:09 2015 UTC,I hear you. I'm not clicking the link but I'm pretty sure coworkers already spoiled what I think is behind that link.
TrueFilm,3927ov,mantasis,2,Tue Jun 9 13:11:08 2015 UTC,Agreed to that. And there are other means of discovering films out there aside from trailers.
TrueFilm,3927ov,ManlyDrinks,7,Tue Jun 9 13:33:57 2015 UTC,"Luckily we have resources like RT, podcasts, and reddit to alert us to great movies without them being spoiled. I've pretty much weaned myself entirely off of spoilers because I find out about movies from Filmspotting or something, get basic info from IMDb, check the ratings on RT, and then make my decision.  Sometimes this doesn't work out so well, I've seen a few awful movies that got 95% on RT, but it's better than having movies spoiled for me. It's fun to watch a trailer afterward and see how much was given away. Ex Machina wouldn't have been nearly as fun for me if I had seen the trailer first, it really gives a ton away - including the ending in retrospect.  BTW - best trailer ever imo is The Prestige, which much like the movie completely makes you think it's going to be about something other than what it actually is."
TrueFilm,3927ov,lordhadri,6,Tue Jun 9 22:33:53 2015 UTC,"Been avoiding all the trailers of the movies I'm interested in for half a year and I'm loving it. It's enough for me to know people behind a movie and what it is overall about, anything else seems like spoiling to me. I also try (for the most anticipated ones) to avoid any critics reviews or even opinions. It's so goddamn refreshing to go into a movie that you don't really know anything about. And it's not like I get dissapointed a lot but even if I do it's still great to form your own opinion not based on your trailer-based expectations or something like ""Well, my favorite reviewer gave it 4 stars, it must be great""."
TrueFilm,3927ov,TriumphantGeorge,6,Mon Jun 8 20:38:38 2015 UTC,"That would be a case of a terrible film throwing everything it has into it's trailer. The movie can be a complete mess, as long as there is enough salvageable material to cut together a decent trailer. Get butts into seats, don't worry about making a good film, especially in the case of comedies or horror films."
TrueFilm,3927ov,withoutamartyr,5,Mon Jun 8 20:55:02 2015 UTC,"The remainder of the movie was: some jokes being repeated to eternity (something about difteria being a huge thing back then), Neil Patrick Harris playing a parody of himself, humiliating performances by once-great Liam Neeson and Charlize Theron, who were clearly there solely for the money, and also... you know how Tarantino plays a character in some of his movies, and his acting is not top-class but you're OK with it because he's not being a pretentious dick about acting? Well McFarlene plays the lead character and acts all cocky about it, while sucking at acting. He's good with voices, not so much as a full-on actor."
TrueFilm,3927ov,bhindblueyes430,6,Tue Jun 9 01:23:40 2015 UTC,"I'm late but nobody else made this point so I will. Trailers intentionally give away as much of the movie as they can so that people know what to expect from the movie. If the movie itself doesn't completely rely on its story and is entertaining in its own right then the trailer giving it away it away isn't so bad. These days trailers are part of a much larger viral marketing scheme that deliberately leaks set photos and plot spoilers and send the cast&crew out to give interviews, all of which works together to manipulate what you expect the movie to be, therefore it is no more or less than you expected. So a movie with a great trailer had better deliver. Mad Max had a great trailer but the final one has just about every highlight of the movie. It doesn't matter because the full movie just gives you more of what the trailer was. Otherwise, you wind up with a lame movie with a great trailer like Terminator Salvation. I would rather watch that trailer than the movie.  I suppose this must be harder for comedies because a comedy trailer needs to convince you that the movie is actually funny, so a comedy trailer will go for cheap laughs and use the best jokes. I don't often go to these movies, and why should I, as there's often little more effort put into them than what you can experience in the three-minute movie trailer. The Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 trailer is adequate trailer-making at first, but then it stops being a trailer for the last minute and simply starts playing the movie including what I can only assume must have been the movie's most elaborate gag.  By now I've seen the trailers for The Gift and Jurassic World at least four times and feel like I may as well have just watched the movies by now.   Then there's a different sort of trailer more suited to our modern, narrative-centric,spoiler-averse times but that is also more risky. For example the Tomorrowland trailers used the same strategy as the movie itself in making everything a big mystery that you have to see the full movie to solve. So far The Force Awakens is using a similar strategy, dribbling out little bits of characters, creatures and vehicles like seeing concept art for the new movie rather than a reduced version of the movie itself.  And then there's the another kind of trailer, the ones that are artistically bold in their own right. The two best trailers from 2015 so far in my opinion have been the teaser for The Walk and the trailer for Knight of Cups. Neither completely give away the movie but are enjoyable to watch on their own.  I like a good trailer. Once you deprogram yourself from caring about plot spoilers, you can approach movies with an open mind without letting their advertising ruin that for you. (Since you are seeing it anyway.) The big problem for me is that most trailers are unpleasant to watch and if you take your seats early you're obligated to watch advertising for six coming movies. Most of them have complete contempt for audience comfort and intelligence. The unfortunate side effect of lousy trailers like that is that they make want to see the finished movies less. I could have convinced myself Terminator 5 was going to be a stupid good time from the little I knew of it, but after seeing the more recent trailers, I now already think it's a bad movie."
TrueFilm,3927ov,GomezTheDragon,2,Tue Jun 9 02:03:20 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the ""deprogramming on plot-spoilers"" but I definitely agree with the idea of trailers being artistic, mini-narratives in their own right.   Trailers that explore the theme and feeling of a film, without actually showing you a micro-cut of the film itself, are great. The two you mention handle this very well. The recent Blade Runner: Final Cut trailer here did a pretty decent job (imagine you haven't seen the film)."
TrueFilm,3927ov,mynameismarkcarlos,3,Tue Jun 9 20:42:16 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm a fan of trailers. Not as teases or spoilers of upcoming movies, but as mini art-pieces in themselves. A well-done trailer is as pleasing to me as a good movie (The Social Network\s debut trailer comes to mind). A lot of people talk about how they like to approach movies with no expectations, and this is why they avoid trailers, but what I expect from a movie is never really a consideration for me for some reason, and how I perceived the trailer has never impacted the way I perceive a film. A bad trailer has never ruined a good movie, nor vice versa. The most a trailer can really ruin is plot, and that's only a portion of what a movie is. I prefer experiencing the film as a whole, and I've found that my level of knowledge of the film beforehand has had very little impact on my enjoyment of it. As far as other people go, to me it doesn't seem that much different from reading the back of a book before buying it."
TrueFilm,3927ov,Internetcoitus,2,Tue Jun 9 22:21:46 2015 UTC,"Devils Advocate: I could care less if the trailer gives away the whole plot. because I dont watch movies for plot. I watch for the story, for the characters, for the emotion, for the directing, acting, sound, photography. for the love of cinema. Plot is such a small component of a movie, and I find it actively detrimental when movies rest on plot to excite the audience."
TrueFilm,3927ov,readedit,3,Tue Jun 9 23:46:21 2015 UTC,"Trailers, even for good movies, can spoil a movie watching experience for me. Definitely not entirely, but enough that if I know I'm going to see a movie for sure, i tend not to want to watch the trailer. However some trailers can give a great idea of a movie and be artfully put together. It just seems like most of the time, trailers are strictly for advertising and not so much for people to get a good sense of the movie. The Coen brothers' movies usually have pretty decent trailers (specifically thinking of A Serious Man and Inside llewyn Davis)."

This is how I've been trying to go, with the exception of STAR WARS. TOMORROWLAND was one example, but now it's THE MARTIAN from Ridley Scott.

TrueFilm,3927ov,Thisisnow1984,3,Tue Jun 9 00:55:50 2015 UTC,"I love trailers. When I was a kid, I'd act them out at the dinner table. I do that today, and all my friends love it so much, they immediately give me a pacifier and a sippy cup.  In all seriousness, I like trailers. While some trailers give away important narrative beats, no trailer can convey how a film treats its characters, and what themes that emerge from that. It's for this reason that great films, especially films you want to rewatch, are trailer-proof. If a trailer ruined a film for you, it's likely that film wasn't good in the first place. I saw someone in this thread complain about the trailer for A Thousand Ways To Die in the West. It gave the best jokes in the film away. That's because there aren't many good jokes in ATWTDITW to begin with, so its advertisers have to work with what they have."
TrueFilm,3927ov,wmille15,2,Tue Jun 9 05:01:45 2015 UTC,I not only try to avoid trailers for films but also as much information about them as possible. All I want to know when choosing and watching a film is the average rating and reviews it received or possibly a recommendation from a friend. This is my ideal state when going into viewing a film.
TrueFilm,3927ov,misterkevinoh,2,Mon Jun 8 22:37:00 2015 UTC,Same here. I even squint during the opening credits so as not to reveal who's even in the film. Nothing better than having a favorite actor suddenly appear when you had no clue they were in the film.
TrueFilm,3927ov,DearEloise,2,Mon Jun 8 23:05:48 2015 UTC,"I tend to avoid trailers these days. Say, Jurassic World. I have no idea if a trailer has shown the actual superdino thing...I dont want to know. I want to see it in the actual movie for the first time.  I used to obsess over trailers and watch them obsessively, but now I like to go in blind."
TrueFilm,3927ov,getoffmylvl,2,Mon Jun 8 22:48:56 2015 UTC,"The problem with trailers and creating them nowadays is that most production houses are still stuck in the 2min 23 sec time frame. This isn't really a standard that bears any merit today. You can make a trailer thats 1min 30 and still have the same effect if not better. When you see a 2min plus trailer and the entire story of the film is revealed it's usually because the film is not that good. As someone who has cut many trailers I can tell you that is the truth. A lot of stories plots can be said in 2min  especially when you are in formula territory which is the case for every single action film and comic book hero film across the board. Bigger budget films including ""The Martian"" are all like this. I think Nolan's Interstellar was somewhat of an exception. It takes a director and producer who are tired and ready to move onto their next project to actively take an interest in the trailer and say something about it being garbage. Most of the time and especially on bigger budget films they don't have control in that department and it becomes committee based through the marketing team who may or may not be as creative as the people who were creating worlds in pre production.  I have friends that refuse to watch trailers at all, where as I love them and see them as an art form on their own. Sometimes a good trailer will be better than the film (man of steel) but more often than not it just reveals too much simply because the film isn't that good. I believe the simpler the trailer the better and the shorter the better. I believe that the root of people avoiding trailers is that firstly it reveals too much and thus spoils the future ""virgin shock"" of the film and second it reveals that there really are not that many good films being pushed out to the masses...so you kind of feel like you're being let down all of the time. If you avoid the trailers you can go into a film and walk out being let down with honour instead of confirming your own suspicions based on the trailer."

I avoid all trailers at every opportunity that presents itself. This may have something to do with my disdain for commercials in general. I hate them incredibly. I believe, if you pay money for cable, you should not be bombarded with advertisements.   In the future, we will choose what channels we want to purchase and they will not contain commercials like HBO and other premium channels. The studios do not understand this but that is why television is dying. If you view a half an hour program, 1/3 of it is pure shit advertisements. Ruining the pace, mood and tone of the program."

I think the best way to approach a film is to assume the role of a disinterested individual. Any other approach will inevitably lead incorrect value judgments and lots of wasted time. Indeed, time will rub out the movies which flourish today solely on what we might call the promise of surprise and spectacle. That kind of pleasure is willed, not an objective quality of the work itself."
TrueFilm,3927ov,kdk12k2k12,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:04:07 2015 UTC,"I think the amount of time between seeing the trailer and seeing the movie, as well as the number of times you watch the trailer, plays a part in 'ruining' the movie. I will watch the trailer right when it comes out, sometimes more than once, but by the time I see the film I have completely forgotten the details of the trailer.  Now, of course everyone's memory is different. Im sure there's that one guy who sees the trailer once and can quote it while watching the movie for the first time, but I think most people won't.  The availability of trailers has changed with the internet,  you can watch every trailer on your phone a million times in your car before you buy a theater ticket; much different from only seeing a trailer once before a main feature.  I would submit that trailers haven't changed that much, rather our access to them has and that is what spoils films most of the  time."

So to start this off I am a HUGE Nine Inch Nails and Trent Reznor fan. I really loved he and Atticus Ross' score for The Social Network and the US version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, and I keep on the up and up about him so I knew he was doing the score for Gone Girl. That alone made me want to see gone girl but I had never even seen a preview. I didn't really care what it was about, it was just about the score for me and whatever it was would be a nice chance to get out. Opening night comes around and I still haven't seen a trailer or even have ste slightest clue what it was about. I got my Icee and candy and sat down. At the end of the film the Icee and candy still sat there untouched. That movie absolutely blew me away. The score was incredible, which is what I came for but the film itself was perfect. If I would have watched the trailer, which I had afterwards, I don't think it would have been the same."
TrueFilm,3927ov,Vermilion,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:56:21 2015 UTC,"I usually watch a little bit of the first trailer to see if it catches my interest, but i rarely watched a whole trailer for fear of something being spoiled. For example, i watched the first trailer for Black Mass and was completely sold. I have deliberately avoided later to trailers, because i will see the movie anyway. I did the same thing with Fury Road."
TrueFilm,3927ov,Vermilion,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:17:41 2015 UTC,"I'm incredibly cautious about them and if I'm too see a movie, I first check reddit, reviewers, critics etc. I'll be less afraid to watch a trailer for non-horror movies. When it comes to horror however I avoid them at all costs. The trailer for The Conjuring I luckily remembered only vaguely by the time I saw the movies, so it didn't spoil it for me like it did for others. I did recall the clapping scare (won't say more if you want to see it l) and just ruined that moment for me. I don't know what's it's with the marketing team and blowing the money shots too early. It's horrible. I'm incredibly hyped for Insidious: Chapter 3 and I've got another 2 months to hold out for the release (Denmark waits for the Bluray to have movies in cinemas) and I haven't came near the trailers at all out of fear."
TrueFilm,3927ov,Vermilion,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:09:56 2015 UTC,"I've been doing this too recently. I've noticed that I've had really good experiences with movies that I didn't see the trailers for and therefore knew nothing about, so it was easier to be surprised by them and enjoy them. So now I've been doing my best to avoid trailers for upcoming movies I get excited about. The big one I'm avoiding is Star Wars, I still haven't seen the big trailer for it. It started playing in a theatre I was seeing a movie in and I just ran out until it was over.  That said, I do have big appreciation for really good trailers that do capture what the full movie is going for. It's just that I think those are rare as marketing tends to dumb down trailers to appeal to the lowest common denominator. For example, I've been hearing that the trailers for Spy turn Melissa McCarthy's character into the ""funny fat person"" stereotype that the actual movie tries to subvert."

I try my best to avoid trailers and commercials for any movie or tv show that I am looking forward to seeing.  I sometimes don't even want to know the premise of a movie.  One of my favorite this is just to watch a movie based on reviews that real people have given it.  If it seems to score high marks then I watch it without consideration of the plot, the actors, director, etc.  I go in completely open to being wowed.

It's not only part of the way you learn about an upcoming film, it's part of the film itself.  It's another route to take in enjoying it.  With that being said, however, I have a huge affinity for going into a movie cold.  There's something about not knowing anything about film that feels like that's how it should be.  The people that created it put so much time and effort into making this that I don't see the point in spoiling it for yourself and detracting from what could be a great experience.  It's already bad enough that we know so much about the non-essentials, i.e. actor's personal lives, the shooting dates, the first released shot of a film, etc.  Why create more hurdles in front of you before even giving the film a chance?"

TrueFilm,3927ov,Vermilion,0,Tue Jun 9 21:05:51 2015 UTC,"I wish to point out that some of us spent 1986-1999 watching complete plot details of the movie before we went to see them.  I never had a real problem with knowing many of the details of the story itself - any more than knowing the lyrics of a song changes my enjoyment of a song.  The commitment of being in the theater fully attentive, the timing, these details really are of far greater magnitude than knowing ""the plot"".  Siskel & Ebert would give extensive overviews of the story, point out details of weak endings etc.  For example, this from Jurrasic Park from 1993: http://siskelandebert.org/video/8HAH6X21O5NH/Last-Action-Hero--Once-Upon-A-Forest--Jurassic-Park-1993  I probably didn't watch this immediately before I went to the cinema, often it would take a week or so.  But I far prefer film reviews, not marketing and advertising - often intended to deceive and misrepresent a film...  Understanding a story is far more important to me than just knowing a story."

TrueFilm,3927ov,Vermilion,0,Wed Jun 10 00:01:14 2015 UTC,"Of course, and most will do.  But that's entirely missing the point.  Some people feel like life needs to be human amp up, bedazzled.  That you need a laugh track added to a well-written TV show.  a 4 minute review of  a film in no way competes with a 90+ minute dedicated listening.  Life is rich and complex, enjoying the density of the content in a dedicated no-pause cinema theater is an entirely different experience and understanding.  Jumping form topic to topic, like the reddit front page of refresh-excitement is exactly the opposite of a dedicated listening and focus on an artist's story.  When you go to lunch with a friend you listen, not just stare at your iPhone and see what random things are popping up on Facebook.  It's a very different psyche attitude of listening and understanding."
TrueFilm,3927ov,TriumphantGeorge,0,Tue Jun 9 04:58:47 2015 UTC,"I'm going to add a second reply thinking about it some more.  If you view art as a tool, a mirror, to connect with other people in the audience or the lives that inspired the story.  You aren't so concerned about spoilers.  The spoiler mentality is a consumption-oriented thinking bout films.   You can put your self in a psyche attitude that people are rich and complex, that life is rich and complex - and understanding things is the greater challenge. Not just the short-term reactions that come from ""the virgin"" experience, but more the depth that comes from understanding an artist's vision.  Understanding their life experience and what inspired them to spend months or years creating that 90 minutes."
TrueFilm,3927ov,danielvutran,2,Mon Jun 8 23:15:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I'm not persuaded.  There's certainly plenty of time to enjoy the ""meta"" aspects - the nature of the shared experience, contemplating the background of the artist, trying to work out the ""meaning"" for the artist himself (even though he doesn't know). But...  The experience of the film itself is the primary piece of art here. If the film was designed to lead you through a journey, in sequence, then trailers do inherently and inevitably interfere with that, with the art itself (which is *the experience).  If you already know that the spaceship blows up and half the crew die, then the first half hour of the film where you spend time with the characters in everyday life will be different. And the impact of seeing that explosion and the aftermath will be different.  Spoilers often result in you watching a film one step removed. You end up considering the film as a structure as you watch it - you find yourself ""working on the film"" rather than having the film work on you.  TL;DR: Watch the film as it was made to be experienced; you look into the artist's life experience afterwards. And probably discover it has very little to do with what you just watched."
TrueFilm,390oe0,Morble,3,Mon Jun 8 11:43:45 2015 UTC,"it was panned at the time by critics for being a relatively generic boxing movie.   That is a bit of an exaggeration. Jack Kroll of Newsweek called Raging Bull the ""best movie of the year"", Vincent Canby of The New York Times said that Scorsese ""has made his most ambitious film as well as his finest"",  Time praised De Niro's performance since ""much of Raging Bull exists because of the possibilities it offers De Niro to display his own explosive art"", Steven Jenkins from the Monthly Film Journal, said ""Raging Bull may prove to be Scorsese's finest achievement to date"", and this is coming after Taxi Driver. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards including Best Picture and won an award for Best Film Editing and Best Actor. The Los Angeles Film Critics Association voted Raging Bull the best film of 1980. The film was by no means critically ""panned"".   the whole movie is told from the vantage point of being Simon’s delusion.   However, I do like that you've pinned down what makes the story uniquely surreal.   his is one of the few movies that show a relatively impoverished character constantly facing the consequences of that poverty, and without really highlighting it as a central theme.   That is also a neat point to observe. I recall ""The Spectacular Now"" being unique in that the main teenage protagonist was a drinker but it was never addressed as having disastrous consequences other than to himself. There was even a scene where he crashes while drink driving, but only into a mailbox and with no casualties or harm to others.   but more importantly, an act which shows Simon that he is very much alive, and that the world is not just going to pass quietly through him as he waits for something to happen, a silent and vulnerable onlooker.   I like this too. He is not invisible, he feels pain, he's not an apparition himself even though he feels like the world treats he is. Or something like that.  Good, well explained article with a bunch of nice colourful language."
TrueFilm,390oe0,LoopyLion,2,Wed Jun 10 06:49:55 2015 UTC,"I watched the movie a few months ago and I liked it a lot, it's like a mix of Brazil with Fight Club and The Tenant.

TrueFilm,38za2b,AlexSitaras,6,Mon Jun 8 02:33:04 2015 UTC,"As far as Enter the Void is concerned, I thought that the movie was meant to illicit the feeling of a DMT trip since the protagonist was a heavy user. DMT is known for having intense psychedelic visuals and hallucinations. If I remember correctly, there is a whole segment where the lead is tripping and we see some of these visuals early on in the movie. DMT is also known to be a chemical released during death (no idea of the validity of this), so the saturated colors and hyper-real imagery seem to make sense as we follow the first person perspective of the character after his death.   I can't really speak to the other movies you mentioned, but in general I think it just depends on what sort of vibe and tone the filmmaker is trying to create. Typically, I think the vivid colors that you're describing tend show up in dream-like or surreal sequences, but they're not limited to that."
TrueFilm,38za2b,tonequality,3,Mon Jun 8 17:39:59 2015 UTC,"I forgot about the (supposed) DMT release during death. I just googled about and it seems that it is inconclusive whether or not DMT is actually released at death. One researcher, Dr. Rick Strassman, seems to think the pineal gland might be able to produce it to that effect but wasn't able to decisively prove it..  LATE EDIT: Come to think of it, the DMT sequence does not resemble Oscar's experiences after death except for at the Love Hotel- 'sex auras', I refer to that imagery. This doesn't really make sense since the effects of DMT do not take days to occur.. The whole last half hour seems haphazard, really.  Regardless, Enter the Void is Noe's film and he can do whatever he wishes with it, regardless of whether or not I question or criticize his choices. I don't think the film is meant to be entirely understandable, but his message (if indeed there is one) is clouded, even after multiple viewings. To me, that takes away from the effectiveness of the film. It becomes spectacle alone, not able to support the degree of storytelling found in his debut film I Stand Alone (also a very stylistic film, but one that I have no issues with).   I think the vivid colors that you're describing tend show up in dream-like or surreal sequences, but they're not limited to that.   That might be the case for Love. My main concern is that it comes off as ineffective rather than artistic or relevant to story. Will have to see how I feel about it upon release."
TrueFilm,38za2b,tonequality,3,Mon Jun 8 19:56:52 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend looking a little bit into the Tibetan Book of the Dead if you want to understand the movie a little better. It's the book that the main character reads in the beginning and the movie loosely follows it. It's about what happens in the time between death and reincarnation. I agree that the movie is not meant to be 100% understandable (it's about what happens after death, after all), but some context on what Noe was going for might be helpful."
TrueFilm,38za2b,afewthoughtsonfilm,2,Tue Jun 9 05:48:22 2015 UTC,"I found this summary yesterday about the book. I knew a little about the book before viewing the film, and the article explains that it is better for the soul to go into the radiant light (which is what Oscar does) rather than dull light. Unfortunately, that doesn't really directly relate to color usage, that only relates to him going into the lights.  As far as choosing his reincarnate form, he enters his father's POV early on in the film, enters another man's in the Love Hotel but finally settles on being reincarnated through Linda. This way, he can fulfill his pact with her never to leave each other for the rest of their 'lives'."
TrueFilm,38za2b,mantasis,8,Tue Jun 9 13:07:57 2015 UTC,"I have yet to see Enter the Void or Love, so I can't speak on their behalf.  I have seen Inherent Vice, however, so I'll speak a little on that film.  The way I see it, the moments between Shasta and Doc aren't necessarily happening as we see them.  Quite honestly, I believe them to be nothing more than figments of Doc's imagination.  The over-saturation, then, could very well be considered a visual representation of the heightened reality Doc is experiencing.  Another film that uses over-saturation in this way is Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark.  In the event you haven't seen it, it follows a woman who is in love with Hollywood musicals.  The majority of the film is undersaturated, resulting in grey and beige hues.  However, during certain moments, the woman enters a dreamlike state where the world around her becomes like one out of a musical.  During these musical numbers, he slightly over-saturates the image to emphasize the fantasy and artificiality of these moments.    Perhaps that's the trend, this usage to emphasize fantastical moments.  It would certain make sense, though I can't think of enough examples at this moment to make any declarative statement."
TrueFilm,38za2b,mantasis,3,Mon Jun 8 05:56:13 2015 UTC,"Perhaps that's the trend, this usage to emphasize fantastical moments.   That would make sense. I hadn't really considered in Inherent Vice that the scene could be his imagination, but that could very well be a possibility through the influence of drugs and longing for her (I'm not a fan of imagination posing as reality, but I'll recognize its plausibility here).   In certain memories the protagonist has in Enter the Void (the first image I posted), your quoted text would be fitting since he is recalling a tragic, irrevocable past. Some scenes in the present, however, are still a little too saturated for my liking. In Love, I'm not so sure its used for fantastic moments literally every still image has that effect (I have not seen the film however, so I cannot confirm yet).. The film also is non-linear and the protagonist recalls his past experiences with two lovers. If time spent in the present is not saturated in color but the past is, then the color use would seem less haphazard/obvious.  I actually have not seen Dancer in the Dark (have seen Depression Trilogy and Dogville so far from LVT). His use of color sounds very unique, and LVT does not use the same saturation effects in each film.  Thank you for your insight!"
TrueFilm,38za2b,Positive_pressure,2,Mon Jun 8 12:44:58 2015 UTC,"It's not Gaspar Noe, it's Benoît Debie. Go through his IMdB page and you'll see he's worked on Spring Breakers and Lost River as well. In fact, Carriers a post apocalyptic film he DPed on has tons of colour even though the genre usually utilizes washed out colour profiles. If you go back to Irreversible, that film also has strong colours...   I don't think you're using the term saturation accurately. I feel your intention is to discuss colour palettes, which are given a lot of significance in films. Saturation being realistic....I would say that many films have no intention of using realistic colour saturation, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's all just style in the end."
TrueFilm,38yro9,27jackstreet,8,Mon Jun 8 00:00:23 2015 UTC,"Really enjoyed this one, was very insightful, and I can see how you've improved from your previous video.   I do personally feel it can be structured better though, as it feels like you're trying to make the same point for over 3 minutes. Even when your showing different examples, they're merely there to set a context for the idea you've already conveyed, instead of you making the point through those actual films.   Try getting into something more meaty, not just a small concept, so you can fill the video up more and structure it more into sections. For example, while you discussed water and how it means rebirth, you could of gone into what other elements and situations could mean for characters and show contrasts.   Create an essay with different ideas and arguments. Show examples where it's well utilized and films where it's not. Structure the video like an actual essay, and build more defined intros and outros to your video, cause you still jump in heavy and end eruptly.    Overall though, did really like it, just wanted to be constructive. You're improving and I've subscribed, keep at it man."

I'm planning on finally watching The 400 Blows though, so I've got that to look forward to.   Schindler's List   Steven Spielberg's masterpiece is still as unflinchingly moving with every viewing. It amazed me on re-watch how many of the more subtle scenes are the most impactful.  Its often hard to watch, but it's simultaneously an absolutely engrossing work of art. The performances by Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley are superb and Janusz Kaminsky's cinematography is aesthetically excellent yet also tells stories of its own. The ending (""I could have saved one more!"") is heart wrenching and still invokes tears, even if it starts to push into blatant sentimentality. 10/10   A Time To Kill   For a film by the director of Batman and Robin this was surprisingly decent. While the courtroom scenes occasionally push the boundaries of plausibility, the film mounts sympathy for Samuel L. Jackson's character very well and the performances from Sandra Bullock, Kevin Spacey and a then relatively unknown Matthew McConaughey are very impressive. McConaughey delivers a monologue near the end of the film that is incredibly powerful and absolutely took me off guard with both the delivery and brutality of the words. As a narrative its a bit clunky and overstays its welcome and the performance from Ashley Judd is laughably unconvincing and for the most part seemingly devoid of authentic emotion. It's nothing special but it's a serviceable courtroom thriller that offers enough great performances to be recommendable. 7/10   Singin' In The Rain   Few films have ever made me feel as happy as Singin' In The Rain. Within 5 minutes it had firmly planted a huge smile on my face and it remained there until long after the credits. As I have a huge interest in film history it was great to see a film chronicle the transition in the late 20's between silent films and 'talkies'. The cast are fantastic and some of their physical comedy is awe-inspiring. The script is warm and delightfully witty and the musical numbers shall stay in my head for a long time. A masterpiece that is also a wonderful testament to filmmaking in all its joyous glory. 10/10   The Water Diviner   Russell Crowe clearly poured a lot of love and labor into this film, and he does a satisfactory job of pulling it off. While I don't think he's made it as a great director yet, his performance in this film is understated and richly layered, the cinematography by the late, great Andrew Leslie is beautiful and when all is said and done it is an emotional film (one scene in particular had me close to tears). It's unevenly paced and is a bit over ambitious in regards to plot and themes, but it's a lavish production that is well worth checking out for history buffs. 7.5/10"

TrueFilm,38wzky,sauceDinho,9,Sun Jun 7 20:29:36 2015 UTC,"The Connection (La French) (2014): Billed as “the other side of the French Connection”, this story follows the Marseilles drug ring trafficking heroin from Turkey to the United States during the 1970's, and the Magistrate determined to bring them to justice. Loosely based on true events, this is a well-crafted crime story. A phenomenal blend of contemporary camera work, and 70's aesthetics. It manages to be both big and intimate at the same time, aesthetically and emotionally. The film’s three leads are all amazing: Dujardin as Pierre Michel, the tirelessly obsessed Magistrate; Lellouche as Tany Zampa, the crime boss; and Malta as Marseilles, the story’s stunning backdrop. The only downside was the film’s inability to move outside of the well-rehearsed beats of its 70's predecessors.  You’ve already seen this story played out in dozens of movies before, but it’s still worth watching once more to see it played so well.  Perfume: the Story of a Murderer (2006): This is an almost supernatural fairytale about a young man with a sense of smell akin to a shark’s, and empathy to match. It is set in the pungent world of 18th century France. What the film can’t let you experience through smell, it strikingly makes up for through vivid textures, sounds, and rich colors. Many shots could be hung on a wall, looking like sadistic twists on Vermeer. Director Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run, Cloud Atlas) brings you uncomfortably close to the scenery. A bit twee overall, especially John Hurt’s occasional omniscient narration, but this is fully redeemed by its visceral qualities.  A Million Ways to Die in the West (2014): Admittedly, I went into this one with a sour face. I'm not usually a fan of slapstick, and rarely of body/bodily function humor, but I had quite a bit of laundry to fold, and wanted just to get down to it. I did conceptually enjoy the digs on romanticization of the old west. A handful of visual gags landed, a few chuckle-worthy cameos, and Charlize Theron was a good sport through several bits she must have known were dead on arrival.  The Tenant (Le Locataire) (1976): Claustrophobia and paranoia in a Paris apartment, played by the man himself, Roman Polanski. Polanski plays Trelkovsky, the smug but meek working stiff, just trying to find an apartment in a tough market. As such, he seeks the apartment previously inhabited by a recent suicide, hoping for a competitive edge. While at first his neighbors appear simply to be French, they become more and more ghoulish in Trelkovsky's eyes, forcing him into behaviors that aren't his own. A slow pace, a tooth in the wall, and Isabelle Adjani all create a tense space for the story to unfold. The build up creates some effectively haunting moments in the final act, and satisfying movie on the whole. Best paired with other Polanski's playing off similar themes (Repulsion, Knife in the Water) or other Adjani's showcasing her peculiar niche.   Let's Scare Jessica to Death (1971): There something I love about the sound in these old movies. It gives so much space for silence, to hear the sound of the wind, or the chirping frogs, or the ticking clock. The camera stands back, and let's you see the world around it's characters. But, at the same time, either due to low budgets, foreign actors, or that space itself, you have this ADR that creates intimate whispers in your ear. You see people walking in the distance, yet hear their conversation happening softly just beside you, like secrets. I walked right into it with this movie. Zohra Lampert, the titular Jessica, has a voice creeps into your skin. So warm, and so cold. She could read me the the Yellow Pages any day. And there it is, whispering and reproaching into your ear, until it's not her voice anymore, and no one's voice is anyone's anymore. This one was a catch.  The Way Way Back (2013) (Re-Watch): This is a carbon-copy coming-of-age story. Duncan, our boy-not-yet-a-man, is the victim of his parent's divorce, and more recently of his mom Pam's (Toni Collette) new romantic relationship with Trent (Steve Carell). An extended vacation for the fledgling family removes Duncan from his from his normal day-to-day trudgery to gloom around some summer paradise where all of the adults act like children, and all of the children act like assholes. The loosey-goosey neighbor, Betty (Allison Janney) swoops down in an ethanol cloud the moment they arrive, providing a plausible distraction for Pam away from Trent's incessant bullying of Duncan. Fortunately, heavy doses of inexplicable and unsolicited positive affirmation from local free-spirit Owen (Sam Rockwell), and from the equally gloomy girl next door, give Duncan the confidence boost he needs to start to forge his own path, and confront the strained relationships in his life.   All of that said, I enjoyed the movie on first viewing, and even still on the second. Despite all of Sam Rockwell's rapid fire glibness, there's a foundation of genuine concern in Owen's character for Duncan, and Rash's/Faxon's (The Descendents) screenplay is structurally sound, even it it's bones are showing throughout. Ultimately, I think I'm just a sucker for these stories because of the opportunity for revisionist nostalgia they provide. They remind of us of our own awkward years, and a chance to see them quickly resolved in ways that didn't always happen for us, with prettier people and sunnier places."
TrueFilm,38wzky,LuigiVanPeebles,3,Sun Jun 7 15:53:58 2015 UTC,"I'm quite a big fan o the way way back. While it's hardly the most original movie ever made I feel like it has a certain reality to it that many coming of age stories lack.  Lots of other coming of age stories seem too far fetched, or their protagonist seems more like a caricature of a teenager than a real person. Duncan is such a realistic character, his awkwardness and uncomfortableness are realistic without being ridiculous or exaggerated and his transformation doesn't turn him into some overly charasmatic hero. He just gains a subtle confidence, it's a very gradual and very real-seeming change. He still is very much the same person he was at the start, just more mature with a slightly less grim worldview. Yes it's a typical coming of age story, but it's my favourite and I could watch it over and over again."
TrueFilm,38wzky,kronos669,6,Fri Jun 12 05:55:10 2015 UTC,"Blue is the warmest color (2013) amazing movie, filming style is kind of similar to ozu's movies, camera focuses almost exclusively on the main actress's. The acting in this movie was excellent specially by Adele Exarchopoulos. The sex scenes do feel a little gratuitous though, they look and feel more pornographic than natural. 9/10  Election 2 (2006) a lot better than the first movie thanks to luis koo's incredible performance. Unlike the first movie this one is a lot more focused on one character (luis koo's). The atmosphere is really good and tense. That said it kind of suffers a little due to low production budget (maybe) as in some violent scenes were not done that well and kind of take you out of the movie. Otherwise this is an excellent sequel to an amazing movie. 9/10  Close up (1990) first iranian movie i have seen and its incredible, probably the best 90s movie. The first 30 minutes or so are a little slow but at the end this is an incredibly rewarding movie. Before watching it you should be a little aware of the basic premise to enjoy the movie a bit more. This is also ranked 42 in the sight and sound poll so really don't miss it. 10/10"

TrueFilm,38wzky,TriumphantGeorge,6,Sun Jun 7 19:10:27 2015 UTC,"Ex Machina 2015 dir. Alex Garland  Ex Machina, Garland's directorial debut, is also probably his best screenplay yet (of the ones I've seen) and a really enjoyable film. It's perfectly paced (I was never once bored) and explores and links complex themes of CCTV, AI, human nature, sexuality and religion to a masterful degree, creating a film which leaves you thinking about what happened and what really was going on the whole time. The dialogue was mostly great and seemed realistic (the characters all had their own unique mannerisms and patterns that really added to the realism - Ava's dialogue in particular summed up her character and the changes she went through), except for a few shaky lines and the direction was also a sight - not overly flashy but effective and built up to the climax superbly. I particularly liked the use of day and night in the film and the colours involved - it would have been easy to not reference what was happening outside but Garland incorporated sleep and darkness into the film and the colours reflected the outside beautifully. Oscar Isaac played the rich programmer brilliantly with a mix of sarcastic wit and subtle menacing perceived power. The audience was manipulated and used superbly and I loved the way every character thought they had it over on each other but none of them thought about the next level up, where someone else was using them, finishing with Ava, the robot, manipulating and outwitting everyone - including the audience.The setting was realistic and the soundtrack, although common sounding, was effective and added to the tension.  The plot was, however, simple and predictable and although the character motivations were complex, it felt like you always knew exactly what would happen next and the twists were basic and all common tropes we are used to (I did like the ending though and thought it went against this a bit). Some of the exposition in the dialogue felt lazy as well and took you out of the film due to occasional sudden dumps of information.  Overall Ex Machina is a really great film and worth watching, even if you aren't a fan of sci-fi normally. 8.5/10  The Dead Zone 1983 dir. David Cronenberg  In which Cronenberg directs and writes a Stephen King novel. A by the books Campbell's monomyth arc is brought to life by Christopher Walken playing an in love School teacher who wakes up after a 5 year coma to discover he has psychic powers. I really enjoyed this film, Cronenberg once again shows he always has a knack for making horror thrillers that really thrill and keep you on the edge of your seat the whole film. Although it did feel a bit rushed, especially the relationship with the boy, the film was intense, relatable and felt based firmly in reality, despite the supernatural devices. You forget it is unnatural for Walken's character to be like this - a testament to brilliant writing and acting. Some of the other characters, however, felt largely one dimensional and, again, rushed as to their development and depth (especially the senator). Overall an intense thriller with some shocking and unforgettable scenes (as expected with any Cronenberg, although this is one of his less strange films, not saying much I know). It's on Netflix, watch it. 9/10  x-post r/flicks. I just started reviewing on letterboxd as well if anyone fancies a look/liked these."
TrueFilm,38wzky,yellow_sub66,4,Sun Jun 7 16:07:51 2015 UTC,"One of the most interesting things about Ex Machina for me was the way it built a parallel between gender power balances and the loss of agency of the AIs. Made for an interesting commentary in both directions. It's pretty masterfully done. For example, when Ava gets dressed, she builds on her feminity and in doing so reveals it as a terribly artificial construction. In one of the best scenes, when she takes off the clothes it's suddenly sexual and it feels revealing, despite her being introduced ""naked"" very naturally."
TrueFilm,38wzky,ampersamp,6,Sun Jun 7 20:05:40 2015 UTC,"I am on Letterboxd, for those who are interested.  Due to a move from my hometown to Huntington Beach, I wasn't able to watch as much as I'd hope.  That being said, I was still able to see plenty great, great pictures this week.   So, in no particular order, What I Watched This Week:   What Time is it There? (2001) dir. Tsai Ming-Liang - Ever since watching the portion of The Story of Film: An Odyssey on him, I have been anticipating my first venture into the works of Tsai Ming-Liang.  I couldn't have asked for a better first film.  What Time is it There? is a beautiful, poetic film about the pain of longing for companionship, with three desperately lonely characters on display in all their sorrow and sadness.  As someone who was recently dumped, this film held particular resonance with me - the aching sensation brought on by loneliness is overwhelming and, through very little dialogue, Tsai Ming-Liang is able to reflect these emotions perfectly.  One moment in particular, in which a mourning widow finally confronts her loneliness in the wake of her husband's death, is particularly tragic and shows the power Tsai Ming-Liang wields with his form.  Without overtly stating anything, he communicates a great deal with subtle character actions and limited dialogue.  Whether it be the male protagonists repeated banging of the indestructible watch or the mother's cooking for her dead husband, Tsai is able to define his characters and their emotions without reliance on heavy exposition or musical accompaniment.  I greatly look forward to his other works. 35 Shots of Rum (2008) dir. Claire Denis - Speaking of poetic filmmaking, 35 Shots of Rum was unexpectedly quite similar.  Although dealing with different themes - in this case, the importance of embracing change in one's life rather than giving in to stagnancy - Denis very similarly provides little dialogue to define her characters and their relationships.  It follows a father and daughter who have reservations about meeting others and engaging in relationships that would break their tight bond.  Through limited exposition, Denis visually represents her character's conflicted thoughts and beliefs.  However, I will admit that, especially in contrast to What Time is it There?, it seems to lack a sense of humanity in its characters.  This piece doesn't pack quite the emotional punch it seems to want to, likely because it's characters are a bit too abstract.  It's not always clear what drives her characters, which makes it just a little less powerful than it could be.  That being said, I look forward to other things by Denis; she is certainly a great artist, but I hope in other pieces, more emotional complexity can be brought out of her characters. Elena (2011) dir. Andrey Zvyagintsev - Continuing on my marathon of Zvyagintsev's small body of work, it becomes hard to determine which of his is my favorite.  Each of the three I've seen - Leviathan, The Return, and now Elena - are brilliant but for different reasons.  Perhaps because it's the most recent I've seen, I'm currently most partial to Elena, which is certainly the most intimate of the three I've seen.  Scaling back the massive scope of his other pieces, Zvyagintsev tells the story of Elena, a subservient woman who cares for an elderly husband while struggling to provide for her adult son's family.  This film is a tribute to the troubles of parenthood and especially the role of the woman as wife and mother.  There is almost certainly socio-political commentary in this film as well, although the extent of this I really can't measure without a larger understanding of contemporary Russia.  In my letterboxd review, one of the things I addressed is the way in which I believe Zvyagintsev, even with so few films under his belt, is already far along the path of cinematic mastery.  His understanding of formal technique is already up there with some of the greats and he has a way of carrying himself in his pictures that is really quite remarkable.  He is a bold, bold filmmaker who has a great future ahead of him. Do the Right Thing (1989) dir. Spike Lee - It's always great when a film hailed as a classic for years is able to deliver on expectation.  Do the Right Thing is definitely the masterpiece everyone labels it as, a film whose maturity even transcends that of it's maker.  This is not a film that points fingers at any one group for perpetuating the racial tension in American society; rather, it points fingers at everyone.  Lee shows how all members in society are guilty of prejudice towards others, and how that prejudice can and has bubble into horrific, violent outbursts.  Using the increasing heat of a summer day in New York as a metaphor for the increasing ""heat"" between races, Lee addresses the issue of how one provides social change within a society, offering Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. as the two paths down which one can bring about resolution.  Smartly, Lee doesn't favor one path over the other, as both equally have merits and the issue is most certainly not one easily solvable.  However, what is very clear is that simple violence is most certainly not the answer, only causing the violence to escalate beyond control.  The ending moments of Do the Right Thing are particularly horrifying given how true they remain to this day.  To be honest, I am awestruck by just how great of a piece Do the Right Thing is.  It's an exceptionally rare film that tackles a serious social issue as objectively as possible, one that carries a great deal of maturity and staying power.  It's a tragedy that this was robbed of any major awards. Touch of Evil (1958) dir. Orson Welles - This might be Welles' coolest film.  It most certainly is the coolest one I've seen.  I summed up my thoughts pretty succinctly here, so I don't have much else to say.  What I can say, however, is that Welles' vision for cinema is one of the greatest blessings to the medium.  His unstoppable ambition to push the medium is really something and Touch of Evil shows just how great of an artist he was. Full Metal Jacket (1987) dir. Stanley Kubrick - Again, my thoughts here sum up my thoughts pretty well; however, I do have a bit more I can say.  As I spent more time reflecting on Full Metal Jacket and comparing it to Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, I'd be curious to hear how people feel about the different choices each artist makes.  The first half of Full Metal Jacket is equally as serious as the entirety of Apocalypse Now; however, upon entering Vietnam, the two diverge in important ways.  Coppola maintains his seriousness in the entire run of his piece, showing the madness of Vietnam in a far more horrific way.  Kubrick, on the other hand, gains a certain tongue-in-cheek quality to the end of his piece, frequently using non-diegetic music (such as the 1963 song ""Surfin' Bird"") to evoke darkly humorous laughter in otherwise horrifying moments.  The ending of the two show this discrepancy quite clearly; Apocalypse Now concludes with the Door's ""The End,"" a serious, dark song, while Full Metal Jacket concludes with the soldier's singing the theme song to ""The Mickey Mouse Club"".  While I don't have a problem with Kubrick's choices, I will say that I strongly prefer the ones made by Coppola, simply because he delves into the madness of Vietnam is the way that feels more meaningful to me, personally.  That being said, I'd love to hear what others think.   Other films I watched this week include Michael (2011, dir. Markus Schleinzer), The Gleaners & I (2000, dir. Agnes Varda), Blissfully Yours (2002, dir. Apichatpong Weerasethakul), This is Spinal Tap (1984, dir. Rob Reiner), A Touch of Sin (2013, dir. Jia Zhangke), Import Export (2007, dir. Ulrich Seidl), and A Prophet (2009, dir. Jacques Audiard).    Feel free to ask me about any of those or for expanded thoughts on the others I wrote about."
TrueFilm,38wzky,afewthoughtsonfilm,7,Sun Jun 7 16:50:17 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about that Apocalypse Now vs Full Metal Jacket comparison last night. Somewhere along the way Apocalypse Now picked up this reputation for being one of the best movies ever and is exhilarating/memorable enough that not many people who watch it question that but I've never really understood what anyone gets out of that movie. It's blatantly a theme park ride through the war and doesn't build up to anything satisfying at all. But it's 'one of the best movies of all time' - it's supposed to be like that, right!?  If anyone was going to screw up a Vietnam War movie it should have been Stanley Kubrick making a comedy about it. To this day Full Metal Jacket is one of the few Kubrick movies that's ok not to like. Yet you get great character development for Joke and Pyle, and unforgettable performance by Ermey that demonstrates the cognitive dissonance soldiers have to get used to, and in the Vietnam scenes a more complex and intimate portrayal of the war than Apocalypse Now ever managed.   Jonathan Rosenbaum points out that Apocalypse Now also fails to give the Vietnamese a voice in the movie, Full Metal Jacket does a much better job of that. I don't think Platoon is a great movie but I also like it more."
TrueFilm,38wzky,lordhadri,2,Sun Jun 7 17:46:40 2015 UTC,"You raise some very interesting points about the differences between the two, especially with the argument made by Rosenbaum.  However, I must ask, though it gives the Vietnamese a voice, does Full Metal Jacket give them a fair one?  The only ones who actually speak show Vietnam to be a den of sin, where the woman's role is limited to being a sex object and the men are thieves and violent aggressors (ignoring the spoiler ).  That's not to suggest that Kubrick is more forgiving to the Americans, but I don't know that Full Metal Jacket gives the Vietnamese enough of a voice.  I would argue that, although not a ""voice"" per say, the scene in Apocalypse Now in which the soldiers encounter the Vietnamese boat with the puppy onboard gives far more humanity to them than any scene in Full Metal Jacket.  Although I don't personally count it among my favorites, I do recognize the brilliance of Apocalypse Now.  I agree that the bootcamp portion of Full Metal Jacket explores the cognitive dissonance the soldier's experience, but that mostly disappears in the second half of the film.  Apocalypse Now, on the other hand, makes that cognitive dissonance the main focus of the film; in other words, it shows its character's struggle to maintain their sanity and morality whilst being thrust into the heart of darkness.  There is a huge discrepancy between WWII and Vietnam in that for the first time, not only did the war seem unjust but in addition, the tactics employed by the Vietcong broke any form of traditional rules of engagement in war.  It was a dirty, confusing war in which it was exceptionally unclear who was a friend and who was a foe.  Apocalypse Now captures this feeling, the confusion, the disillusionment, all while bearing a deadly serious tone.  I don't fault Kubrick for the humor in Full Metal Jacket - it provides a nice contrast to other films on the subject - but I think that Coppola better captures the emotions of the subject better, personally.  And I also don't like Platoon much either.  I don't exactly know where I'd rank it, but it certainly feels like a lesser film to me.  Have yet to see The Deer Hunter, though; I'm very excited for that."
TrueFilm,38wzky,afewthoughtsonfilm,5,Sun Jun 7 19:56:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know what Rosenbaum's liberal interpretation of Full Metal Jacket is though he did say Apocalypse Now is way better compared to the Deer Hunter. Kubrick's film is less specifically about the legacy of the Vietnam War, and perhaps THAT is why I like it more. Whatever rending experience that was supposed to be for America, it's beyond my understanding now. Coppola and Cimino seem not to get past those politically relevant points whereas Kubrick and Scorsese did. I think Oliver Stone also sees these things in a wider political context."
TrueFilm,38wzky,lordhadri,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:06:18 2015 UTC,"That's fair.  I hadn't actually considered that, actually; I think the fact that it was set in Vietnam made me look at it really with just the lens of a Vietnam War movie.  I certainly agree that Kubrick's film is less about that war than just the consequences of war in general."
TrueFilm,38wzky,afewthoughtsonfilm,2,Sun Jun 7 20:56:51 2015 UTC,"I would argue that Coppola's take is far less interested in the war itself than Full Metal Jacket. His Vietnam War is pure mythology, not history. He never shows you anything outside of the journey. There's no real war to speak of or greater context beyond the experience of the characters. It's a particularly ageless setting, and that's how Coppola presents it to us. Full Metal Jacket features that external world, both physically and as a ""before"" for the characters."

TrueFilm,38wzky,ampersamp,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:54:55 2015 UTC,"I certainly liked it more than his follow-up, Rust and Bone, which I can't stand.  It's got many redeeming qualities and the opening hour is especially poignant and wonderful.  I didn't like how it shifted tonally in the second and third acts, but he definitely puts a lot of effort into the style of the film, which I respect.  Definitely a good entry from 2009, not my favorite but still very good."
TrueFilm,38wzky,afewthoughtsonfilm,2,Sun Jun 7 19:59:48 2015 UTC,"It's a very meditative film to me, which perhaps speaks to the mood I was in when I first saw it. I was entranced by the slightest touch of magic realism (recently watched the Exterminating Angel which I liked on similar grounds). In terms of a ""rise to power"" story, I think it hits all the right notes and was more memorable to me than the second Godfather. As for 2009, I still haven't seen White Ribbon, but plan to. The secret in their eyes was excellent, but 500 Days of Summer actually holds a special place in my heart."
TrueFilm,38wzky,ampersamp,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:19:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind the magical realism so much (I thought it was an interesting choice to make his first victim a companion of sorts).  But the montages set to pop music just did not fit with the seriousness of the first hour, which really frustrated me.  It became increasingly light hearted, which I found to not work as well for me.  That being said, I do agree that overall, it is certainly a good film.  The White Ribbon is an excellent film, not Haneke's best but still a great one.  My favorite film of all time is Antichrist, so that's obviously my favorite film of the year.  But 2009 also has Black Dynamite, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Trash Humpers, A Town Called Panic, and Up in the Air.  It's a pretty great year for sure."
TrueFilm,38wzky,afewthoughtsonfilm,8,Sun Jun 7 20:54:42 2015 UTC,"The last two weeks have been kinda slow, but I managed to watch a few films where The Lady Vanishes was the best film i had not seen before     The Shining (1980, re-watch) Directed by Stanley Kubrick  The score and the creepy twins still give me chills. Kubrick was a master at creating an effective audiovisual experience. I love the framing of isolation and the otherworldly feel of the hotel. Nicholson is creepy and although he hams it up bit at times he is a joy to watch. Duvall seems really broken and terrified, she most definitely did not deserve her razzie nomination. I would rather say she makes the strongest performance in the film even though Nicholson’s performance was more iconic. Lloyd was also fantastic in his role and it is a shame he gave up acting afterwards. 9/10     A nightmare on elm street (1984) Directed by Wes Craven  Really dated in some parts, but still iconic and entertaining. The acting is pretty painful at times, especially the lead actress. Freddy himself isn’t really that scary, but rather goofy. The effects and makeup are great tough and most of them hold up very well. 7/10     The lady vanishes (1938) Directed by Alfred Hitchcock  Start a bit slow, but the film becomes really intriguing on the train. I really like how Hitchcock builds tension even without a score, something I did not learn until after the film was over. The film has great sense of humor as well and I never expected to laugh so much in a Hitchcock film. 8/10     Black Swan (2010, re-watch) Directed by Darren Aronofsky  This is the performance that made me take Natalie Portman seriously, it is a far cry from her performance in the star wars prequels although Arnofsky is far better director than Lucas. Mila Kunis is not an actress with much range, but she does well in her role. Vincent Cassel is also great, but that is no surprise. It is also great to see Winona Ryder in brief albeit memorable role. Nina’s transformation is gradual and tense where Aronofsky utilize a lot of effective imagery both obviously and subtly, it is creative and even terrifying at times. 9/10     The Birds (1963) Directed by Alfred Hitchcock  I have to admit I was a bit disappointed yet I can see how influential the film has been. Hitchcock still was fantastic at tension and his camerawork was in an own league. But the special effects are severely dated and laughable at times. The last act inside the house however redeems the film for me, as we do not see the birds too much and the birds on top of the footage effect is not used. It was the first time the film became really suspenseful and the characters did not seem protected by their plot armor anymore. 7/10"
TrueFilm,38wzky,noCunts4me,4,Sun Jun 7 16:25:16 2015 UTC,"I just last night watched The Shining in a mountain hotel's movie theater, completely alone. No joke. With the proper creepy atmosphere it was a 10/10 movie. My visit at this hotel is about ten times more unnerving now, but it was worth it.   Something I noticed this time was how strangely beautiful I found the blue/orange color scheme in some shots of the cook in Miami. It reminded me a lot of the color and lighting in Doc's house in Inherent Vice"

TrueFilm,38wzky,thunderhorsenig,8,Mon Jun 8 00:30:32 2015 UTC,"Serial killers and lovers on the run seem to be the themes of the week.   Chungking Express Wong Kar-Wai, 1994: My virgin outing with Wong. Finally a movie that’s so different from anything else that it’s utterly beyond words.  Monster Patty Jenkins, 2003: I watched this out of curiosity for Charlize Theron’s Oscar-winning performance after seeing Fury Road so many times. It was also Roger Ebert’s favorite movie of 2003!   The movie follows standard biopic formula by making Aileen a sympathetic character (at first), building the narrative around her, and letting Christina Ricci (also very good) stand-in for the audience. This has the remarkable effect of making a story about someone who turns herself into a monster who murders all men for being potential rapists look like a reasonable lifestyle choice. But I think this is intentional, because the end result of the movie is a sort-of anti-Hollywood ending narrative done in disarmingly accessible Hollywood style. So it could have been a lot better but still turned out kinda interesting if you see it that way.  Into the Abyss Werner Herzog, 2011: I didn’t know what to make of this. Herzog mostly stays out of this, which isn’t what you’ve come to want from him. It’s clearer in the other documentaries why he shows what he shows. He also interrupts his subjects a lot, which I consider poor form.   There’s something immediately unsettling about almost every person interviewed in this movie. You can tell they all had unique reactions to these events that are unknowable to us. I like it when documentaries help people relate their unusual stories like that on their own, with Grizzly Man being a really successful example of that.   Maybe it’s not focused on enough in this movie. I don’t think it works as an anti-capital punishment film but maybe it’s not meant to because it becomes a more interesting story about the relationship between class and the law along the way. There’s also a late-movie twist that makes it completely clear why Herzog honed in on this particular case but it’s so strange it ends up overriding the previous 90 minutes.  Rango Gore Verbinski, 2011: Nothing can really prepare you for a Verbinski movie. It’s not so much a movie for kids as western genre panto theatre. I’d heard this was good, but the not the way I expected. What a delight!   You Only Live Once Fritz Lang, 1937  Rewatch - Zodiac David Fincher, 2007: The best horror movie of the new century. (And this week’s ultra-long getting-it-over-with movie)  Rewatch - Badlands Terrence Malick, 1973  Rewatch - Pather Panchali Satyajit Ray, 1955: Theatrical 4K presentation. It’s nice to finally see the Janus logo in front of these jewels.  Edit: I also had a dream of an alternate ending to Ex Machina that would have blown everyone's mind."
TrueFilm,38wzky,lordhadri,3,Sun Jun 7 16:46:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty similar haha, also more of a Shyamalan twist sort of ending. Caleb realizes both robots are human and he's the robot trying to be tricked into seeing the humans as robots. And then they kill him. It's dumb but the way it happened would have been really unsettling body horror in a movie.  Also Caleb was Willem DaFoe for some reason."
TrueFilm,38wzky,lordhadri,5,Sun Jun 7 20:48:15 2015 UTC,"Sucker Punch  Directed by Zack Snyder and starring Emily Browning, Sucker Punch is about a girl who following her mother's death, is sent to a mental institute by her evil stepfather and due to the constant torment, escapes into a multilayered world of her own imagination. It sounds like a cool concept, but sadly Sucker Punch just doesnt hold up. There are a grand total of 3 good things in this movie:   Cinematography. Much in the same style of 300, there are plenty of slow motion set pieces and swoop-like shots. Great angles that really put otherwise mediocre action scenes into motion. Soundtrack. This electrifying blend of rock and metal is absolutely pumping and excellent in every sense of the world. I could listen to it for days on end. Hot girls in skimpy outfits. Pretty self explanatory.   For a movie so very inspired by anime and other Japanese influences, Sucker Punch could've been a great western reimagining. However it falls apart fast. The first 20 minutes were pretty cool with a very stylised introduction to the story, and the first dream sequence had some merit, but for an action movie the action scenes are incredibly poorly directed. It becomes soon clear that the girls are invincible and the enemies have no chance. Mechs and Nazi zombies are cool for a while, but the choreography is 90% of the time pretty bad. There is no excitement outside the odd slowmotion scene and its very tame. Almost all the sets have this weird ugly filter of brown and grey and the overall production design isnt very inspired. CGI is good but not much to back it up. The story and dialogue are horrible to say the least and are compounded by the most lifeless acting ive seen. You know how Cabin In The Woods made fun of the tropes in modern horror? This movie is so devoid of any personalities it would have actually benefitted from that. Zack Snyder cant even deliver on the fight scenes. Its so sad to think of the potential this had. Seeing Emily Browning in a miniskirt, thigh highs and wielding a katana can only carry so much of the movie. This movie is one of those that would MASSIVELY benefit from an R rated sequel. A different prodution designer and a writer wouid be a godsend. Snyder has talent but he lost it on this one. Sorry Sucker Punch, for all your great ideas, youre going in the gutter.  5,9/10  Dark City  Alex Proyass' neonoir scifi thriller is something to behold. Rufus Sewell plays an amnesiac who finds himself wake up in a city devoid of sunlight and controlled by telekinetic aliens. He is on the run simultaneuously from the police as he is convicted for the murder of a couple prostitutes, and from the aliens since he possesses their weird powers. Dark City blends an odd mixture of Kafka, Twilight Zone and Metropolis. Atmospheric and incredibly tense and compelling, Dark City is a modern masterpiece. Kiefer Sutherland joins the cast as a harsh, lonely detective and so does Jennifer Connely as Sewell's estranged wife. The architecture is something to behold and the entire world thats created is something of an epic creation. Dark City's ambition was only held back by budgetary constraints, but its influence reached both The Matrix and Inception. Its tighly controlled and restrained which works to its advantage. If i had any flaws, it would be that the performances couldve been a tad more impressive and there are maybe 1 or 2 scenes that couldve been better directed. Otherwise, Dark City is vastly underappreciated and its moody tone pervades to this day.  9,6/10  Drive  Ive been looking to this one for quite sometimes. Ryan Gosling plays a stuntman/mechanic in Nicholas Winding Refn's crime thriller. After befriending his neighbour, a mother with a young boy whose husband is just recently returning from prison, Gosling is entangled in a criminal plot and seeks to help his neighbour from becoming endangered by local thug. Rarely do i see a movie as perfect as Drive. Its hypnotic incredibly stylish. The dialogue is sparse but the visuals alone serve the storytelling so well that it always kept me invested. Drive may be called slow by some, but every cut is delibarate down to the bone and the long, still shots all carry meaning. Gosling is able to emote so much of his charater through his facial expressions and every single member of the supporting cast is astounding. The story is straightforward but the characters are all deep people and the soundtrack always maintains a runny melancholic feeling that together with the neon, dark aesthetics, turn this into a suprisingly pleasant and beautiful film. Its rather violent, but its done with a great deal of purpose and Refn knew exactly how to portray these scenes. Drive is a modern work of art and becomes the 2nd movie Ive given a perfect score to.  10/10  Chronicle  This came as a bit of a suprise. I was in need of a short runtime and when i saw it and it was completely different from what i expected it to be. Josh Trank's directorial debut stars Dane DeHaan as a depressed teenager who together with his middleoftheroad cousin Alex Russel and incredibly popular class president Michael B Jordan, discover an alien artifact that gives them telekinesis. This is far from a standard superhero movie and instead plays like a scifi thriller. The teens come to terms with their powers and at first are quite content to using them for everyday matters like pranking people or impressing girls. They soon learn how to fly and the cinematography is astounding here. Did i mention its filmed as found footage? DeHaan is determined to film his high school experience and soon learns to make the camera follow him. The format plays heavily in the films favour and the most impressive aspect of the movie is how real it feels. Everyone feels like a real person and the SFX are simple but incredibly convincing. I honestly related to the movie and because of that it became believable. The suspense is so palpable and the immense uncertainty makes the movie so very tense its fantastic. I couldnt take my eyes off the screen and it helped how the chemistry between each of the leads worked so well. It felt written by someone who understood real teenagers and wanted to present a ludicrous subject matter in a mature way. Chronicle doesnt utilise almost any score/soundtrack and it doesnt need to. Its not a brilliant movie and not exactly exceptional on a filmmaking level, but it stands alone very well.  8,4/10  Irreversible  Im a huge fan of Gaspar Noe's Enter the Void, and this revenge thriller did not disappoint. Monica Belluci plays a young woman who has befallen a horrible fate and her boyfriend (Vincent Cassel) together with another friend (Albert Dupontel) are out for revenge. I dont want to spoil this movie as it is so visceral and captivating in that psychadelic Noe manner. I will spoil however that there is nothing in this movie i wouldve wanted to be different. Its cheated to look like it was shot in one take and the dialogue is all improvised. Its a dark, twisted tale told in a unique narrative manner (wont spoil) that is spellbinding in every sense of the world. Itll make you feel dirty and enthralled at the same time. I dont know what else to say about this movie as its so raw one can only comprehend its genious by watching it. Some may call it sick and exploitative (alot of people think of French New Wave this way), but its an important piece of cinema. Irreversible joins The Grand Budapest Hotel and Drive in the elite club of 10/10  Edit:Grammar"
TrueFilm,38wzky,TrumanB-12,4,Sun Jun 7 22:21:05 2015 UTC,"Drive is one of those films that comes at just the right time and inspires an entire generation of art. Synthwave and dreamwave had been musical powerhouses for a couple years prior, but ""new retro"" as an aesthetic hadn't really found its voice or its audience. Drive set the colour palette, the typography, the soundtrack, and the overall atmosphere for a movement that's now really picking up steam and producing some damn brilliant titles in other mediums.   The film itself is one of my favourites and will definitely go down as a classic, but its impact is going to be a really interesting case study in a few years."
TrueFilm,38wzky,happybadger,5,Sun Jun 7 15:38:05 2015 UTC,"Inside Man (2006)  My first experience with a Spike Lee film was unfortunately underwhelming. Overall the film showed some decent stylistic flourishes, but the writing just seemed stale as fuck. Clive Owen's character is such a blatant rip-off of Tarantino's overwritten style of dialogue that it seems the script for this was scavenged out of Tarantino's garbage. Also, Clive Owen can't deliver these lines. He sounds like he's recording a bad audiobook. The better actors in the cast (Ejiofor, Washington, Foster) have nothing to do, unfortunately. It just seems like something I would have written as a teenager after seeing Pulp Fiction. 5/10  The Verdict (1982)  Sidney Lumet has got to be one of my favorite directors at this point. He handles this fantastic script with restraint and style in the most admirable way. Paul Newman's performance is his best work, and James Mason, as always, is both hilarious and terrifying. The plot being what it is, a moral attack on the Catholic Church for letting people it employs do their job poorly and get away with it, seems eerily prophetic for what would be revealed in the coming decades. 8/10  Do the Right Thing (1989)  Now that's what I'm talking about! My second foray in Spike Lee's back-catalog was very successful. I watched it in preparation for The Canon's then-upcoming discussion on the film, and it was definitely worth it. Perhaps the most honest depiction of racism in cinema. There's no cartoony shenanigans here that plague so many other racially-themed film like The Help and countless others. Everyone is at fault to different degrees, as it is in real life. Immensely well-filmed to boot. 9/10  Spy (2015)  I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. Genuinely funny jokes with genuinely funny actors is my idea of a good time. McCarthy, despite her sometimes poor choice of roles (which this film satirizes to a tee), is a great actress, as this shows. All supporting players do really well, particularly Jason Statham. I need that guy to go full Leslie Nielsen at some point in the coming years, because his comedic chops in this are too good to pass up. The odd joke may not hit, and Fieg needs to work a bit on the connective tissue between his big scenes, but there's not much more I can say against the film. A great time, but also really smart. The second-best-Feminist Action Thriller of the summer. 7/10"
TrueFilm,38wzky,allhewhoknows,8,Sun Jun 7 21:51:56 2015 UTC,"Blood on Black Lace Directed by Mario Bava (1964)- Until now Bava hadn’t really done it for me in terms of horror (Black Sunday and The Girl Who Knew Too Much were a little boring but I love Danger Diabolik), he was like Argento but much more dialled back which made his stuff a little dull. Blood on Black Lace doesn’t catch him up with Argento’s crazy but it does give Bava a chance to have more fun. While The Girl Who Knew Too Much was a riff on classic Hitchcock this seems like his twist on the Vertigo era, especially when it comes to the use of colour. What separates this from Hitchcock, as is the case with Giallo flicks, is the portrayal of murder and death. No one gets stabbed from behind in a big arm wave that kills them instantly, death is an unpleasant and dignity-removing act. Most of the film is set in and around a fancy clothes shop ran by Cameron Mitchell and it’s always juxtaposing the pristine constructed beauty of the shop and people in it with the sloppiness in the murders. It begins better than it ends though. They go to great lengths to set up a bunch of red herrings so that by the time the actual culprit’s revealed they’ve got barely any time to be developed. Certainly the best Giallo by Bava I’ve seen so far but he’s still not quite my bag as he’s still a little dull and flat.   It Follows Directed by David Robert Mitchell (2014)- Been excited for this for a while and unlike the last big horror film to get buzz, The Babadook, it didn’t disappoint too much. It begins like a supernatural STD parable as after having sex Maika Monroe is told she’ll now be followed by an unstoppable entity that can take any human form until she sexually passes it on to someone else. But beyond that premise it ends up being much more about sexual trauma as it’s about how this curse initially makes Monroe unable to trust, unable to look at the world without fear, and barely able to sleep. I didn’t hate The Babadook but it didn’t say enough or scare enough to really jump to that next level of great for me, it was creepy and did have something to say but it left me a little lukewarm. It Follows on the other hand feels comparatively rich when it comes to what it’s exploring and how it’s scaring you. As it went on it lost its hold on me and much of the final third left me cold but it was at least always introducing new ideas and adding more depth to what it’s talking about. Where it loses me is where cg becomes a bit more prevalent, but still it’s really good. Though it’s got a bit of that throwback spirit with a Wes Craven-esque world and an eye for crisp compositions like John Carpenter (with added synth-y score) but it’s so far from a retread. It may have elements of these 80s horror films but it’s still something thoroughly new. Even the score that draws from music of the past is still very much a modern score that fits this story perfectly. With all the Carpenter-esque sounds it’ll then throw in something more chiptunes-y or something that bolts us back to modernity. Mitchell has himself a brilliant premise here and he uses it so well for much of the film. He’s constantly playing with stillness and at times had me chuckling just due to how brazenly he was trying to unsettle us. My current watermark for scariness/creepiness is Pulse and this didn’t quite get to that level but it was still a brilliant modern horror film. Few horror films right now are as thematically rich, well directed, or affecting. Compared to some recent ones that did well like The Conjuring it makes them look so duff and personality-less. This is a film, they are haunted house rides.   Nosferatu Directed by F. W. Murnau (1922)- Liked it more than I did the first time but as I say in the theme month thread I still prefer Herzog’s - http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/38stmf/remakes_the_fable_and_the_fanboy_nosferatu_1922/  Nosferatu the Vampyr Directed by Werner Herzog (1979)- See above.   White Material Directed by Claire Denis (2009)- All I’ve seen of Claire Denis’ films before this is Beau Travail and this is a similar experience. She makes uniquely perplexing films that aren’t puzzles or forcefully obtuse. They’re films that begin with fully realised worlds and characters who we learn about through observance. Much of what has defined these people has already passed and she’s not one for heavy exposition. She’s not a full on realist though, far from it, but it always feels like what we’re seeing could well have happened or be happening. This film stars Isabelle Hubbart as a woman running a coffee plantation in a war torn African country. She’s been told repeatedly her and her family should leave but she’s adamant about staying. What I like about Denis’ style is that it leaves us as the audience constantly questioning what’s happening. Never in a frustrating “I don’t even have a handle on this"" way but in a way that has us primed for whatever she’s exploring or has to say. Questions a scene may raise, causing us to probe at the meaning, will later be built upon or responded to often tying into whatever the first scene made us think about. There are little thematic reverberations throughout that turn it from an expressionist portrayal of life in a ravaged land to a treatise on White imperialism and the horrifying consequences of imperialistic arrogance. Denis is not as simply didactic as that though as she’s not merely chastising white folk for meddling in Africa. She clearly identifies and sympathises with them. Not all of them are the source of these issues they’re just a result of them. Sometimes the shaky cam got a bit much for me (though I already had a sore head so it wasn’t wholly the films fault) but it allows the brief respites of stillness to be even more impactful, often as a character takes in whatever chaos has just taken place. In some ways the film is scattershot, hitting on lots of different things, but there’s such a clarity to the hectic world they’re living in that I don’t really mind. It creates such a strange, violent, and foreign atmosphere where the ravages of war go further than bloodshed and into a full-on distortion of what we consider the things that make us civilised people. But that’s shown to be an arrogant expectation, that things will be the way we want them or expect them to be in a place constantly in flux. Beau Travail stuck with me more but this is certainly close. Very intrigued to check out the films of hers that are more explicitly in the realm of horror as it’s something she’s clearly interested in. Well worth seeing and like all her films I don’t see it talked about enough, if at all.   Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (Re-watch) Directed by Matt Reeves (2014)- Kind of randomly ended up seeing this again and it was a chance to re-evaluate as I was a little harsh on first viewing. Or at least I thought I might’ve been. Effects-wise it’s still amazing. That orang-utan is the closest I’ve seen cg get to reality when realising a character. That character deserves more screen time for more than the effects though as he’s involved in one of the few side plots that isn’t just exposition or statement based, yet sadly it goes nowhere. What bothers me most about this film is how many great images and ideas are in it despite them being shown so uncinematically. I like that Reeves keeps things coherent and clear but that’s basically all the camera is used for. People state what they think and feel about everything, every plot point and character beat verbalised, and there’s little room for things that actually give people character. It’s no surprise the apes come out as the most distinctive characters as the mo-cap tech highlights and relies upon expressive performances. I’m a sucker for the Apes movies though so I’m on board to an extent and appreciate that it’s a blockbuster that at least doesn’t feel like every other blockbuster, I just wish it had personality.   The Lady Eve Directed by Preston Sturgess (1941)- Funnest film of the week. Barbara Stanwyck (my new dream woman) is a hustler working in partnership with two other swindlers trying to rip off Henry Fonda’s nice guy. It’s a romantic comedy that’s actually romantic and funny. It’s also funny how much we’ve progressed since the forties in a lot of ways yet some people are still asking “Are women funny?” when here there’s no doubt, it’s not even a question. Though Fonda has many funny moments and reactions it’s Stanwyck who’s the comedic lead and she nails it. As a whole it’s non-stop charming and full of hilarious moments. Maybe not as cinematically energetic or affecting as Sullivan’s Travels but a great screwball all the same."
TrueFilm,38wzky,lordhadri,2,Sun Jun 7 17:34:42 2015 UTC,I keep wondering if I was really unfair to Dawn of the Planet of the Apes too but I think you nailed it. Maybe if you turned that exact story into a short picture book about diplomacy for children I would be fine with it but the way it's done as a movie just wasn't very exciting. It both doesn't have enough in it and is too long at the same time...ambitious but not really successful.
TrueFilm,38wzky,jberd45,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:34:47 2015 UTC,"It both doesn't have enough in it and is too long at the same time..   I just watched it yesterday, and I found it fine.  Not great, or mind blowing; just adequate to kill an evening at home.  Had I seen this in a theater, I would have felt a little ripped off.    I wonder how much consideration modern filmmaking puts into the idea that such films will eventually be shown ten times a week on cable.  This may explain why it seemed ""too long""; the filmmakers put extra parts in so that there would some stuff to cut when FX plays it every Sunday afternoon for a year and a half."
TrueFilm,38wzky,lordhadri,2,Sun Jun 7 17:04:26 2015 UTC,Somehow I ended up seeing it twice theatrically and that's pretty much how I felt. I probably would have been easier on it at home. But it's too dark-looking and too visually safe and threw in that one long take to distract everyone from the overall blandness of it.
TrueFilm,38wzky,lordhadri,2,Sun Jun 7 21:15:36 2015 UTC,What bothers me most is how it shouldn't look bland. Images like the petrol station in the forest and the apes suddenly firing out of the myst should take greater root than they do but it's all shot the same. That second one bothers me the most as it's a striking image that could be used to express the seismic shift happening right here but instead it cuts away and just makes it an action beat.   It looks and feels a bit like a big budget tv show so I get that.

I understand that it was going for a modest, understated ending, but I strongly disliked it (the ending). It was a great movie up until then, and had the potential for true greatness had it really what I felt to be a third act. I know every movie shouldn't have a ""Cabin in the Woods"" level of third act-edness, but I was left with so many questions.   I completely agree about Dawn, though. I cannot understand the praise it has gotten, aside from the visuals."

TrueFilm,38wzky,kingofthejungle223,2,Mon Jun 8 07:32:26 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS   how/why it started and how it can end.   That's kind of unanswerable as the film isn't interested in the mechanics of the literal monster. The whole demonic force is more of a supernatural stand-in for sexual trauma and even a youthful perception of sex. That cannot be explained because those things cannot be easily explained. At the end in the pool she's facing off against the image of her father (potentially implying a horrible past as is also implied when the other guy gets done but it in the form of his mother) and is only able to shake this endless fear, lack of trust, and change in self perception that comes with sexual trauma by facing it. At the end it takes someone to understand, to be there, not so that this returning horror is vanquished but so that the whole storm of it can be more easily weathered. Before no one understood, she was alone with her horrors, but now it's shared. Not in the way that it was shared with her where the load is merely passed on but instead lifted together. But even as good as things may be there's still the lingering threat that it could return, because trauma like that doesn't just disappear forever."

TrueFilm,38wzky,kingofthejungle223,2,Mon Jun 8 17:16:57 2015 UTC,"Re: The Lady Eve... God I love this movie.  Maybe I'm just blinded by Stanwyck, but it wears well every time I revisit it (I really need to go back to Sullivan's Travels and see if I like it better on a rewatch as well).  I love how Sturges winks at the audience, with lines like the ""You see, Hopsi, you don't know very much about girls. The best ones aren't as good as you probably think they are and the bad ones aren't as bad. Not nearly as bad"" that's basically laying out how the rest of the movie will go.  Or at the end of the first story ""Eve"" fabricates in the train, after Pike talks about ""sweet forgiveness.""  ""Sweet what?"" Eve interrupts, in all wide-eyed innocence.  ""Sweet forgiveness!!"" Pike reiterates.  I think Peter Bogdanovich mentioned the 'unexciting' way Sturges shot The Lady Eve, on his nice little intro to it on the Criterion DVD. The chaise lounge scene is the obvious example, but another great, relatively long, relatively static shot is for Eve's first story on the train.  I think he knew he had great material with great actors handling it, and knew he didn't really need to do much to have it conveyed well on screen."
TrueFilm,38wzky,lordhadri,7,Tue Jun 9 00:57:34 2015 UTC,"Persona (1966) directed by Ingmar Bergman  Ingmar Bergman’s storied bit of art-house catnip from 1966 has inspired a wealth of appreciative writing, much of it saying more about the authors themselves than Bergman’s estimable film.  In Against Interpretation, Susan Sontag declares it a film that actively resists any attempt to interpret it, suggesting that regardless of what one wishes to make of it, there always seems to be a detail or two that undermines any possible interpretation.  As Robin Wood points out, this theory is itself undermined by Sontag getting one of these allegedly uncooperative details wrong - she suggests that Alma bites Elizabeth rather than the other way around.  Without this little switcheroo, the characters aren’t nearly as impenetrable as Sontag suggests.    Robin Wood poses Persona as a feminist parable about women seeking an alternative to a world dominated by men, but this reading leads him to conclude that the second half of the film falls apart, because (and perhaps this is Sontag getting her vengeance) the latter portion of Bergman’s film resists his interpretation.  I would suggest that this is a flaw in Wood’s interpretation, rather than in Bergman’s film, or the act of interpreting itself.  As always, Andrew Sarris is the voice of reason: “Some reviewers have indicated that more than one viewing is necessary to understand Persona fully.  I doubt it.  A hundred viewings will not bring what is off the screen onto the screen.  A thousand will not unlock Bergman’s mind.  What Bergman chooses not to tell must remain unsaid.”  To extrapolate a little from Sarris’s last sentence, I would suggest that the interpretive possibilities of Persona’s narrative might not extend any further than the rather straightforward philosophical dialectic presented in the text (about the complicated relationship between the suffering celebrity/artist and their adoring non-celebrity/public).  Outside of this celebrity/non-celebrity, creator/consumer opposition, the film says little of substance about identity, mental health, feminism, politics or patriarchy.  Despite what at first would seem to be the oblique obscurity of the Persona’s opening, Bergman is actually being as straightforward (some would say downright obvious) as he always is.    But none of this really matters, because Persona’s power lies elsewhere: It’s in the confrontational closeups of Elizabeth and Alma, the abstracted beauty of the compositions that merge their forms, and the ever-present threat of violence and destruction ominously intoned in the soundtrack (which plays like a Bernard Herrmann score robbed of any sense of musicality).  For once, Bergman has made something of a visual experience (and I’m not talking about his flashy formal tricks borrowed from William Castle seven years after the fact).   If this isn’t a film that can be appreciated without sound, it’s at least a film that can be appreciated without subtitles.  Whether or not one thinks all of this adds up to a great film or a particularly profound work of art, one has to acknowledge that this film is, at the very least, an object of visceral fascination. 7.5/10  Other films watched this week:  Cop Hater (1958) directed by William Berke  ...and speaking of objects of visceral fascination.   This is a taut, unusually sleazy little B-crime film adapted from a novel by Ed McBain.  It’s certainly no masterpiece, but it’s an enjoyable, run-down little film.  7/10  The Mugger (1958) directed by William Berke 5/10      Red Desert (1964) directed by Michelangelo Antonioni      I’m a little worn out from talking about Persona, so I’ll keep this brief unless prompted to expand.  Antonioni is a modernist master and this, his first color film, is (to use the words of /u/pursehook) “a visual feast”.  The film has a narrative, and it’s not an uninteresting one, but I’d guess that plot-first critics would probably hate this film - Its rhythms are deliberately contemplative, even slow.  Antonioni is most interested in fashioning a landscape out of the simplified forms of modern life - made of metal, rubber, burnt garbage, yet possessing a unique beauty worth appreciating for its own sake.  I almost get the sense that this film would work as well as a gallery installation that people wander in and out of.  It’s a portrait of both the beauties and vulgarities of modern life, and a film that I am certain will reward repeat viewings. 8.5/10"
TrueFilm,38wzky,kingofthejungle223,2,Mon Jun 8 02:54:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge Bergman fan, though I do appreciate his work. I haven't seen too many of his films, but from what I have seen, his style seems to override the writing. The Seventh Seal is my favorite of his, but that still seems to falter due to him overflowing his style over what he's saying with the story, which leads to me being kind of frustrated with plot devices and conflicts. A lot of it just seems more beneficial to what he's trying to show visually, rather than the characters or story.  There's still a bunch I need to see from him, Fanny and Alexander (Which I imagine will be my favorite, since it does seem more focused than his others, from what I hear), Hour of the Wolf, Wild Strawberries, I can't say this problem is true with all of his films, it's just something I noticed, especially with Persona. Visually powerful, but a bit emotionally unfulfilling. I just want more to grasp onto with his stuff.  I will give his other films a shot in the future, I hope I just had a bit of bad luck with what I started out with, and he has a film that I don't have this issue with. When that happens, I'll probably write-up about it here."
TrueFilm,38wzky,Sadsharks,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:37:33 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you mean.  His writing tends to be very insistent - just sort of speaking out his thoughts on the world in a way that's very literal and intrudes on the drama, and his imagery, while always well photographed (in terms of lighting and greyscale balance, his cinematography is always pretty), is rarely composed in a way that's expressive or emotionally varied.  He's usually a very cold and frankly boring director - but I fortunately didn't have that problem with Persona.  It kept me interested enough to keep watching, and faces of the two actresses were compelling in a way that most Bergman cast members aren't.  Here's a famous image from The Seventh Seal which is very typical of the way Bergman works.  It's constructed through a very literal use of symbols.  There's a man playing a game of chess against someone dressed in black (death) - dressed ridiculously enough that his costume seems to announce that this should be received as capital-A Art - and in the background we have the horizon and a seemingly endless body of water, which we can assume represents eternity.  So, if we decode it, this represents man's struggle against mortality in the face of eternity.  But the image only works on an intellectual level, each detail is like a character representing a letter in a larger word.  The image itself is fairly banal, it doesn't make us feel anything (there's really no emotional content in it), and because the details have such a literal, 1 to 1 relationship with their significance in the larger message, the image really only works on one level.  It's interpretive possibilities are straight-jacketed by Bergman's narrow intent.  Here's F.W. Murnau's interpretation of the same basic idea   This image functions on at least three levels.  First, it's beautifully composed.  It's like a painting you could hang in a gallery.  Murnau uses line and shading to carefully lead your eye around the frame.  Second, it carries an emotional impact within the narrative.  The image poetically evokes in the viewer a sense of loneliness, isolation, romance and futility - all of the emotions that Bergman's characters can only tell us about.  And Finally, it has a symbolic thematic import (like the Bergman), a suggestion of man's struggle in the face of eternity.  Murnau sees this struggle not as a game of chess (something that can feasibly be won), but as building monuments in the sand, something that carries an air of recklessness, futility, and maybe even a little hubris.  Because he's so much more skilled a visual artist, Murnau communicates in a single frame what Bergman sweats over for an hour and a half."
TrueFilm,38wzky,morningbelle,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:57:40 2015 UTC,I would have to actually bother to watch more Bergman to be sure of this but I wonder if he was at his best when he was focused on characters and not trying to do that stuff. And that technical virtuosity what many of his fans at the time supposedly liked about him. At least he seems to grasp silent visual directing. There's several of his movies I'd rather give a shot that trying to sit through Persona which is probably the most conventionally 'major' one I haven't seen yet.

My Summer with Monika was a character piece that I didn't particularly like, though.  Persona is also very character focused, but I liked it better for other reasons haha.  I haven't been able to construct a unified-theory of Bergman yet, because Persona is the first film of his that I've found that hasn't bored me to tears."
TrueFilm,38wzky,kingofthejungle223,3,Tue Jun 9 00:37:42 2015 UTC,"Clouds of Sils Maria (2014)  Absolutely great movie.  Made me think of a more restrained, intellectual version of Birdman.  Binoche continues to be a master.  Reminded me of the DeLillo novel Point Omega.  The twist is an absolutely brilliant, very brave move on the directors part which shows a lot of faith in the viewer.  I also loved the subtle references to film history like the brief mention of Klaus Kinski.  A few criticisms though:  Moretz's character gets far too much of a pass for her cruel, destructive behavior.  I can't help but think Klaus is a total hypocrite for claiming to admire Dorothea but still employing and respecting the person who drove her to attempt suicide.  Why do all the characters seem so ambivalent about this?  I mean, they all even saw it coming and did nothing, but none seem to have a hint of regret at all in the end.  Maybe the part with Maria looking at pictures of her is meant to imply that she feels bad, but a few minutes later she's calling Ellis ""smart"" and acting like there's nothing wrong with what she did.  There's a few weird bits of camera work in spite the general beauty on display.  A lot of scenes look strangely grainy, perhaps on purpose, and at one point the camera seems to cut an inch to one side and make no other movement, which seems like an error that should have been caught while editing."

TrueFilm,38wzky,TheGreatZiegfeld,3,Sun Jun 7 20:32:09 2015 UTC,"My Letterboxd account  Saw a ton of great films this week, but seriously people, seek out The Parallel Street. It's masterpiece yet barely anyone has seen it/heard about it.  Goodbye, Dragon Inn (2003): A film of silence and atmosphere. Relationships are established through wordless interactions, characters seem to glide throughout the world gracefully, and at the film's core, a deeply felt sense of loss and longing. The camera rarely moves here, Ming-liang holding on his perfectly composed images for minutes at a time. We are given the time to ponder, to empathise, to observe; every little action, every little sound giving us insight into character and mood. There's also an oh-so-subtle undercurrent of comedy here, an almost imperceptible sense of playfulness which only enriches the films singular tone. A potent concoction of idea and execution. Truly something special; the kind of film you get lost in.  His Girl Friday (1940): If Altman made a screwball comedy in the 1940's, it'd probably look a little something like this. Hawks turns a witty, verbose script into one unending barrage of rapid-fire dialogue and breathless exchanges. Conversations are constantly interrupted, everything from a desk, a phone to a human being becoming an obstacle for these eccentric characters as they attempt to communicate as fastly and loudly as they can. Cary Grant may now be my hero. Hilarious and precise.  The Hypothesis of the Stolen Painting (1979): There's something undeniably cinematic about watching an observer walk within the paintings they are attempting to deconstruct. Ruiz's dreamy, reflexive formal touches help to enrich what would otherwise be a fairly dry work of cinematic interpretation. I do wish the film wasn't so didactic though; suffocatingly intellectual dialogue being spoken over mostly static images isn't my idea of great cinema, no matter how interesting the ideas may be. I did love the way the film's ending singles in on the haunting quality of artistic interpretation; images and thoughts linger in our mind, meaning within meaning within meaning.  World on a Wire (1974): Fassbinder's camera captures existential angst like no other; his world is one of distorted reflections, dim light and emotional distance. Within every single location Fassbinder finds an image, a frame or a movement which seems to perfectly encapsulate the disturbing implications of his narrative; to leave one awe-struck over your compositions is a feat in and of itself, but to do it consistently over 3 and a half hours is a godsend. There's also that distinctive tone which Fassbinder seems to nail every single time, the combination of his perfectionist framing and theatrical, at times melodramatic blocking turning every conversation into a fascinating game of emotion and power.  The labyrinthine narrative which Fassbinder weaves here is masterful; the first half revels in the uncovering of it's fascinating conspiracy, the second half exploring the haunting implications of what is discovered. The most terrifying thing about artificial realities is the way in which they imply that what we see, touch and feel is an illusion. What scares us (or at least me) the most, is the way they can suggest that the very things we cherish can be changed and distorted within an instant. Fassbinder understands this, and much of the film's existential terror is born out of concrete truths becoming malleable.  Fassbinder's film ends on a note of hope and sacrifice; two realities merge into one as we cut between images of death and rebirth. These characters may never truly find their 'reality', after all, each protagonist here is nothing more than a reflection of a reflection. Instead, what they can find is themselves; ""I am"" proclaims our lead character, the only truth that's worth fighting for. A sci-fi masterpiece.  The Parallel Street (1962): The enigma of human existence transcribed onto celluloid; a truly profound work of cinema. 5 men sit in a room with one simple task; to watch, arrange and order a collection of randomly numbered 'documents'. These 'documents' take the form of poetic, free-flowing filmic essays; essays which work to explore life, death, nature and humanity. As these 'documents' are screened, dream-like narration becomes entangled with earthy images, existential musings which somehow never feel pretentious. What is the meaning of these 'documents'? That's the question that these 5 men, and by extension this entire film, attempts to ask. It speaks to something universal, to our constant need to find logic in the illogical. Throughout the film you find yourself being bombarded with a multitude of meanings, thoughts and feelings; intuitive connections which hint at something deeper. When The Parallel Street ends, there are no answers given, no mysteries explained. Existence itself is an enigma, and so is this film; everything is meaningful and nothing is. WATCH THIS, IT'S SO SO UNDERSEEN.  Bed and Board (1970): For much of Bed and Board, Truffaut simply lets his characters sit, listen and talk. His camera-work here is still joyously cinematic, but there's an underlying sense of subtlety to the film's stylistic games, Truffaut finally understanding when and how to implement them. The pacing is so relaxed that at times it borders on contemplative (which may frustrate some people), and I love the the fact that for much of Bed and Board we do nothing more than watch as a married couple live their lives together. At the core of the film is a deeply felt understanding of marriage and relationships; an understanding of the way in which compromise becomes a constant, and love and hate can be one and the same. Truffaut does everything he can to make the central marriage feel real, and the charming, at times heartbreaking performances only enhance this. Also clearly influenced by the likes of Tati (the first scene in Antoine's new office especially, not to mention the blatant 'cameo') and Rohmer (taking notes from the master of cinematic conversations). One of Truffaut's best."

I think Hawks has more affection for his characters than Altman does, but I can see where you're coming from.  Altman acknowledges Hawks as a big influence on him.  In fact, he even got Leigh Brackett, one of Hawks' favorite screenwriting collaborators (and even more importantly, the lady who adapted The Big Sleep for him) to write the script for The Long Goodbye."
TrueFilm,38wzky,TheGreatZiegfeld,3,Sun Jun 7 23:42:49 2015 UTC,"Paddington directed by Paul King (2015) ★★★★  I never would have pictured myself saying this a year ago when the trailers for the film were coming out, but Paddington is currently my favorite movie of 2015. This is a delightful movie that really just shows us as an audience what kids films should be. It is definitely made for a child audience, it’s about a bear with a marmalade addiction trying to find a home in London. But it’s also a movie that treats its audience as more than just children. It treats its audience like intelligent human beings. It can make all kinds of jokes and it just trusts the audience to understand. No jokes are rude, but there’s lots of puns that some kids won’t clue in on, others will, but that’s why it’s so fun. It’s a movie that I wish I had as a kid so that I could go back now at this age and love all the more.   Film Socialisme directed by Jean-Luc Godard (2010) 1/2 star  Film Socialisme is basically Goodbye to Language without everything that made Goodbye to Language so damn fantastic. In style it is pretty much the same, lots of weird audio cuts, warm color temperature, disjointed scenes that don’t piece together in the way you’d like them to. But it lacks two of the key points that make G2L special. Innovation and theme. I essentially feel like this was Godard’s warm up to that film. He does nothing new in this movie, but you can see him building towards a lot of the new things he tries out in G2L. Godard has always been an innovator in film, someone whose films are always doing radical, strange new things. There’s nothing new about this. In fact, it’s rather dull. Pretty to look at, but dull. It’s also thematically empty, and just feels like a string of disconnected vignettes that even scene to scene feel disconnected. Godard hasn’t lost his touch, but if this were his last film I would have felt sorry for him. It would have left the impression that he was losing his mind in his old age.  Before I Disappear directed by Shawn Christensen (2014) ★  Adapted from his own Oscar-winning short film, Curfew, Shawn Christensen’s Before I Disappear had a lot of promise. It should have been really good, but unfortunately Before I Disappear is much closer to Christensen’s Taylor Laughtner vehicle Abduction in terms of quality than it is to Curfew. This is over dramatic, schmaltzy, pessimistic, indecisive work. It’s a serious “I am very important” drama that wants to be a Wes Anderson movie. It’s a buddy movie that wants to deal with suicide and drug addiction. It’s a movie that I didn’t know how to feel about and it seemed like the director didn’t fully know either. From the poorly tacked on “Dear Vista” voice overs, to the extra storylines with Ron Perlman and that Gideon dude, this was a movie that just seemed like someone stretched a short film over an hour and a half. Curfew was so good because it was short and sweet. It was a brief glimpse into the turn around of a life. Before I Disappear took all those scenes and added a ton of filler to extend the runtime, and taking away the effect. I will say though, Christensen knows how to film a musical number. The bowling alley is a touch of genius.  Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench directed by Damien Chazelle (2010) ★1/2  I love Whiplash, but wasn’t as enchanted by Damien Chazelle’s debut feature. Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench is a “jazz musical inspired by MGM spectaculars of the golden era of Hollywood” but that really doesn’t describe it at all, I saw little to no influence from the big Hollywood musicals, I saw a lot more Godard and Demy in there, except a more flawed version of either. It’s a low key, more french new-wave inspired, mumblecore, musical(?) comedy(?). It’s also very much a student film. Chazelle is trying to find his feet as a filmmaker. Is he a musician? Is he a filmmaker? That’s really what he’s trying to find out with this film. His musicality shines through. The soundtrack is excellent, and the song sequences are by far the best parts of the film (although they are far too few). Also for a film with such a minimal simple plot, I found it to be ridiculously convoluted. Some good parts, lots of mediocre to bad parts."
TrueFilm,38wzky,otherpeoplesmusic,3,Mon Jun 8 00:01:44 2015 UTC,"Stranger on the Third Floor  The directorial debut from Boris Ingster, Stranger is an interesting project in visuals and mood, and it's certainly one of the more daring directorial debuts I've seen, up there with a lot of the French New Wave names. He definitely seems passionate about this project, even despite its goofy and kind of dumb moments. It's an intense, visually strong film, it just needed a lot of tightening when it came to editing and writing. Even despite the flaws, the strengths of the film absolutely make it worth a watch. Not exactly a perfect film, but one that's not worth ignoring. 7/10  The Box of Pandora  Georg Wilhelm Pabst's supposed magnum opus, Pabst's German silent doesn't go for the common route of Expressionism, but rather a naturalist visual style. Pabst seems a bit new to this style, and he does seem to stray at times, but when he's focused, it's one of the most satisfying silents of the late-era. Countless incredible moments mixed with a few dud moments. 9/10  Charleston Parade  Randomness for the sake of randomness, and I absolutely hate saying this word with certainty, but Renoir works with a pretentious state-of-mind to create a film that is not funny, thought-provoking, or worthy of any more than one viewing. A few cool visuals make this not completely worthless, but for such an arrogant piece of filmmaking, Renoir shows little to none of the talent he's exhibited in his best films. Completely atrocious. 3/10  The Little Match Girl  ... And yet, Renoir does have a lot of talent. This creative, visually interesting film does exhibit a lot of innocence and humbleness that makes Renoir so great. Basically mouthwash for his previous film. It has issues, the acting isn't great, and it is fairly aimless, but as a purely emotional work, it's fine. 7/10  Journey Into Fear  A few outstanding scenes and ideas, mixed into a forgettable and slightly annoying film. If it interests you, try it, otherwise, maybe just watch a few scenes individually. I do see Welles' directorial style in this film, but it feels like salt to overcooked fries, if I'm allowed to make a bad comparison. 6/10  Pitch Perfect 2  I laughed several times at this film, but with characters only serving as stereotypes, it really is a thin film that escapes the mind quickly, with nothing likable to grasp onto, aside from a group of funny announcers, and Key & Peele serving their purpose well. The writing is absolutely this films downfall, as everything else is serviceable. But for a comedy, bad writing is inexcusable. Not a painful film to watch, however, it was definitely a waste of time. 4/10  Not my week. Best film was obviously Box of Pandora. Only great movie I saw last week was Scarlet Street, so definitely try that one out too."

TrueFilm,38wzky,duckduckmooo,9,Wed Jun 17 18:50:43 2015 UTC,"We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011) directed by Lynne Ramsay  A very modern film, with the use an aspect ratio that seems way too wide for the story at hand and then shot in way full of ostensibly illogical close-ups, often cutting of large amounts of the characters and the sets; frequent use of ironic pop music; and so on. But, it really distinguishes itself. The Every Frame a Painting video on Lynne Ramsay's work helped shed some light why. The casting is perfect. For sure, the performances are great in this, but I think it's fair to say they were magnified by just how right each actor looked for their respective parts. While this was shot very intimately, the film still makes full use of the wide ratio: skillfully arranging the players about the screen for maximum expression; allowing it to avoid superfluous cuts; and making the distortion at the ends of the image from the wide-angle lens, helping develop the uneasy atmosphere of the film, more notable. The film's plot itself is obviously compelling. And there's plenty more, like the sound, that's done really well, but I can't really describe.  What's going on under the surface is a little less well done. The film's mostly just scenes of Kevin being a terrible person, to the point that I honestly thought the film might reveal he was actually possessed by some demonic being, evil incarnate. It's a testament to the formalism of the film that this is extremely compelling and doesn't seem ridiculous. Of course, just leaving it at that is a little unfair as clearly there's more going on in the film -- the way the film unfolds, in flashback, with the Mom cleaning up her house (her life); the mirroring between Kevin and her; the way he loses all hostility and even becomes affectionate to her when he's vulnerable; and the ending all seem to imply that film's positing that maybe Kevin isn't evil incarnate, that his Mom had something (maybe quite a bit) to do with how he turned out. The problem is, I don't really think that film expands enough on this view for the film to be able to stand behind it. Then again, the fact that I came to that view maybe means that film can credibly claim, and even if not that how well-made it is means it is still nonetheless a thrilling, harrowing, frightening, and affecting watch.  ★★★★  The Babadook (2014) directed by Jennifer Kent  This was very good. The quality of the Babadook's parts differentiates it from most horror -- most movie -- fare. The editing impressively slingshots over skimming over well-trodden images and scenes while somehow still carrying the full weight of them and can be more restrained when it needs to be. The photography and set design presents the standard bleary, colorless, creepy world, but manages to do so in a way that feels fresh. The two lead performances are fantastic, managing to present full hysteria without ever becoming enervating. And, the imagination behind the movie, such as the monster design, and the way it's presented -- that fucking pop-up book -- and the way sleep is shown, conveying that it's the only true rest the two leads have, is on point. Which leads me into what's best about the film -- that it puts all this pieces together into a cohesive whole. That it uses its scares rather than expending all its energy into creating them. Sleep is the only true rest for the characters; the days, even when they aren't harassed by the babadook, are exhausting. The world is cold, censorious, and unhelpful. It presents to us the difficulty of what the protagonist is faced with, making us understand the want to just almost give up, and then shows us the futility and impossibility of that. It builds up to a conclusion that's uplifitingly positive without being quixotic. All along doing so with style.  ★★★★1/2  Oculus (2013) directed by Mike Flanagan  The first half of this actually has a very interesting hook: actual demonic force or psychological repression? Of course, the way the film handles isn't great, going about the question in an unstimulating and bland manner, and the attempts at differentiation, accomplished mostly through week Whedon-esque quips, fall flat. But, that question is still good enough to carry the film to the point where it dismisses it. At first, this dismissal seems like a bad thing. The film becomes a little formless, and the reliance on horror movie shorthand, such as the creepy-eyed ghosts and the ending, show there isn't a whole lot going on to this. But, the dissolving of the lines between the past and present, if not especially earth shattering, at least held my interest, and damn if it didn't scare me.  ★★★  You're Next (2011) directed by Adam Winberg  Just ugh. The cold opening was actually really promising -- great directorial economy. It's all downhill from there though. The characterization is so shallow, the attempts at dramatic conflict are so transparent, and (no doubt because of the first two) the performances so wooden that there's no risk of actually giving a shit about any of these characters. Then when people start dying it's just variation on people getting separated from the others through some contrived means and torture porn. I don't really get the appeal of it. Yeah, it produces some tension before the lone characters meet their inevitable doom, but it's not exactly hard to manufacture that -- just throw in some voyeuristic establishing shots, then pull the camera in close, and you've got it. -- and doing it over and over makes it even less impressive. There's nothing that interesting about people getting maimed in unparticularly clever ways, and that's coming from someone who likes Paul Verhoeven. On top of that the film throws some humor that is so obvious and dumb it can't be funny, some painfully obvious twists, and some nods to financial and political issues that are insulting in how the film thinks it can give itself meaning just by halfheartedly referencing them. The opening, the pacing, and the grammar are the only positives I found in this.  ★1/2  The Big Lebowski (1998) directed by Joel and Ethan Coen  I don't really feel like mustering words for this.  Alright, well, I guess I'll try and give and explanation for The Big Lebowski. I'll preface this by saying that I should give it another shot in the future, as I feel like I may have been a bit to narrow minded during it. This had the typical Coen brothers' caricaturized characters, which I'm neutral on, and condescension, which I'm not a fan of in droves, even more so than in their other films I've seen. On top of that, there was nothing I found that could really draw me into this. In Barton Fink you had the crazy surrealism, in Fargo you had Marge and her husband, etc. In The Big Lebowski you have, what, the winding plot, which separated from the breakneck pace of noir I didn't find especially compelling; the kind of ""noir parody"" thing this has going on, which isn't enough for me (I really like The Long Goodbye, but mostly because that's just a great film by itself, ignoring how it pokes fun at noir);or the lead characters, who just came across to me as giant assholes (yes, even the Dude)? I suppose that leaves the humor, which I'll admit was audacious. A lot of it didn't click for me, partly because some of it came at the expense of other characters, but also mostly because something just kept me from getting into it. I think it was because the takeaway I got from this film was, ""life is absurd and meaningless, so you might as well be an asshole."" Which is obviously unpleasant. I'll admit it seems unlikely that the Coens would make something that simplistic, which is why I'm very open to changing my opinion on it, but that's how I stand for now.  ★★"
TrueFilm,38wzky,lordhadri,9,Thu Jun 18 05:06:56 2015 UTC,"“You’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole”    I didn’t have that takeaway.  One takeaway for me was that of the dude’s own mindset – Accept life the way it is and be content, be happy and peaceful, you don’t need anything to do that, other than a mindset.    Yes, many of the characters are assholes and I view the tumbleweed in the opening scene as a metaphor for a purposeless reality where the wind will take you randomly whether you want to go with it or not.  I think it’s relevant that many characters are chasing something, money, art, porn, bowling, whatever, but they all end up at the same juncture as the dude, who doesn’t chase anything (other than replacing the rug, which was forced upon him).  The dude is content without chasing anything, and has his own state of mind, being at peace with everything around him.  I’m not sure why you’d call him an asshole—he might come across as selfish at times but I think that’s just because another character has disturbed his peaceful mindset and he’s forced to act—and the dude doesn’t like to have to do anything.    While many of the characters might be assholes, they don’t believe this in their own minds.  Walter, for example, has a strong moral belief in right & wrong, when he’s an asshole it’s because he always felt he was wronged – cheated on in bowling so he goes crazy, baseball bat to the car because he thought the money was stolen by the kid, etc..  He believes he is a good person.  I like this because it seems true to life.  We’ve all known assholes in our lives or even been friends with some.  Many of them aren’t self-aware that they are an asshole, that’s just how they act.  I’ve had “Walters” in my life that I still loved, there’s something about their naivete as to their own actions that becomes endearing somehow.  On top of everything else, the movie makes me laugh hard every time.  Thanks for your thoughts, I’ll probably end up rewatching it tonight now."

TrueFilm,38wzky,otherpeoplesmusic,3,Sun Jun 7 17:14:47 2015 UTC,"The Babadook and We Need to Talk About Kevin is the difference between great genre movies and great horror movies. Both are about the fear of giving birth to someone evil but The Babadook gives you an metaphorical monster while Kevin gets to be the monster on his own. And The Babdook still relies a bit on those easy scare tropes while Kevin burrows deeper into your fear centers. For example instead of relying on the creepy kid thing for chills, Kevin takes a creepy kid and really runs with it to the worst possible conclusion.  By the time Kevin is getting a box in the mail you're already expecting it to be something awful. He opens it up and it's just a U-lock. Nice try Kevin, what else is in the box? Another identical u-lock. And you just know that's the worst possible thing that could be in there, without knowing why yet. I didn't love the whole movie unconditionally but I really loved that part.  I was so looking forward to an explanation about The Big Lebowski today. Tease! Did you watch The Big Sleep yet, I can't remember."
TrueFilm,38wzky,happybadger,2,Sun Jun 7 17:48:47 2015 UTC,"See, I think what you said about We Need to Talk About Kevin actually outlines really well what I really liked about it. I thought that some explanation on what made Kevin would've taken it up another notch, but it wasn't that necessary, after all I still thought it was great. And The Babadook and We Need to Talk About Kevin are very similar, but I didn't think the The Babadook was about the fear of birthing something evil. I thought it was more about dealing with grief and parenting, which the monster in the film metaphorically was. The kid was impossible to deal with, but I don't think I once thought he was potentially evil. Though, looking I am starting to think I prefer The Babadook by a smaller margin. To me it has a more pleasing, complete story arc, but We Need to Talk About Kevin like you said runs with its idea beautifully.   And, well, I guess I'll try and give and explanation for The Big Lebowski.

TrueFilm,38wzky,JockeyNL,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:06:27 2015 UTC,"You're right, they're different, but it's playing off the same fears of motherhood gone wrong. And they're both made to feel like it's their fault, which makes it worse.  The Big Sleep was my key to understanding how convoluted noirs are supposed to be watched but if you get The Long Goodbye you're probably all set there. I don't think the Coens are saying it's okay to be an asshole, I glean from several of their movies that they're just really worried that it might be okay and are looking for any small kindnesses or zen approach that make life more than meaningless.  You Only live Once is a perfectly good old noir, though I've been struggling to remember how it ended and can't find a complete plot summary, lol. Henry Fonda is very good in it. Scarlet Street is the best of the Lang noir trilogy from this period, but I liked it a bit more than Woman in the Window."
TrueFilm,38wzky,happybadger,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:25:01 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much in the same boat with The Big Lebowski. I'm always in the minority of people who don't see anything special about it. It's ok, sure, but, it's not that great.   One thing I've had to do over the years is just say 'fuck you' to anyone who questions why I didn't like it. It always turns into a long, drawn out 'but what about this, and this, and that, and this' and it turns into a nothing debate about why I should like a film I don't care about. I pretty much refuse to justify why I don't like it anymore. It's funny, because it turned from me not really liking it into hating people who do like it because they want you to like it and piss you off in the process. They always try to claim that you 'dont get it'. It's just as condescending as the film.   I've seen it a few times and it remains as flat and bland as the first viewing, imo, but maybe in the future you'll find something else, I dunno.  Either way, you ain't alone, brother, you're allowed to have an opinion that doesn't sit with the majority."

JK Simmons had the most electric performance of the year and one of the best of the past decade, tremendously elevated my respect for him and set a gold standard for teacher roles, while Miles Teller firmly established his name as one of the best upcoming actors out there and finished the film with the best musical display I've ever seen in cinema.  I can't recommend it more. Outside maybe Birdman, there isn't a film I've enjoyed more this decade."

One of them is an attempt to go through all of Disney's animated canon films, seeing as I missed out on most of them as a child and haven't had any exposure to the vast majority of the older ones.  I just got through Lady and the Tramp last week, and I've been trying to find the time to watch Sleeping Beauty.  And the other one's a bit more nebulous.  There's this website, 366WeirdMovies.com, that I really like to frequent, with the goal of cultivating the best of weird, off-beat movies, enough to have one for every day of the leap year.  I've been jumping around their listed movies, candidates and rejects, trying to find anything that interests me.  Saw Bronson and Vampire's Kiss because of them, and I'm intending on trying out El Topo and Holy Mountain (and its remake, Doggiewoggiez!  Poochiewoochiez!) soon.  S'a fun ride.

TrueFilm,38wzky,Stack42,3,Mon Jun 8 02:03:11 2015 UTC,"Been very busy with finals week, but it wrapped up yesterday! And to celebrate, I decided to watch a de jure classic from a de jure auteur. And, well.....  Pierrot Le Fou - J.L. Godard '65 -  ⋆⋆½  See my Letterboxd review for specific details. Varda's films are about real people in real situations. Demy's films are about real people in movies. And Godard's films are perpetually stuck in the movie phase. JLG's characters blithely philosophize about their own shortcomings, wallow in their own self-pittying ennui, and agitatite with pop-politics that reflects Godard's own shallow view of the world. You may think ""Well, that's the point,"" but I haven't seen the real Godard in any of the movies that I've seen (barring, pehaps, Contempt). He prefers to hide behind a smoke-screen of grandstanding cliches. All the irksome deficiencies of the cinema of Godard's movies are in full bloom in Pierrot Le Fou, whose images are as hollow as a painting in an elevator. (A shame, because along with Anna Karina's delightful performances, Raoul Coutard's photography is one of the best things about 60s Godard.) God bless Anna Karina, for keeping Godard's philosophizing ass in check. SHE is a person I can believe exists, not Belmondo's gallumphing wanna-be intellectual. (Again, you may say, ""That's the point! He's S'PPOSED TO BE A DUMB-BUM! ETC.!"" Then why the hell is Godard so attracted in spending so much time building up a character he doesn't, in the end, like anyway? I'm not particularly interested in investing much time in the guy if we're supposed to hate him in the end.) When Karina screams to Belmondo in the middle of the movie, ""I'm TIRED of running! I'm TIRED of literature!"", I clapped as loudly as I can. No wonder she left Godard.  In a Godard, everything is a put-on. The songs (which Demy does with better conviction and more emotion). The genre-mixing (which Chabrol isn't a pretentious DJ about). The female characters (who are much more interesting, and who are actual people, in a Varda). At some point, you wish the joke would stop and you ask yourself, ""Will the REAL Jean-Luc please stand up?""  Aside from the Karina performance, one of the best things about this is the surprise Sam Fuller cameo. Of course, like any self-serving Godard protagonist who is pretentiously interested in ""le cinema"", Belmondo asks Fuller what, in his opinion, is cinema. Though I can't be too sure Fuller's answer is actually his, Fuller says, in effect, ""Cinema is feeling emotions."" Fuller has proven that time and time again. With the exception of Contempt, Godard (time and time again) fails to inspire ANY emotion in me...'cept maybe....well, you know the word.  Godard may have been first, but Varda mixes philosophy, literature, existential musings, subtle humor, and explorations of the nature of art--the things JLG does--in a much more convincing and better manner. And unlike JLG, she isn't smug/high-falutin' about her ability to do so.  Donkey Skin (""Peau D'Ane"") [Re-Watch] - Jacques Demy '70 - ⋆⋆⋆⋆½  More fun than Disney fairy-tales, that's fer damn sure. What other movie can lay claim to the fact that they have a whole musical number about baking a damn cake?  It's kind of fun to trace Demy's career, and how far he's come since Lola, his bona-fide New Wave film that aroused praise from everyone--including good ol' Godard! And it's also kind of funny to realize that Lola may have been his most ""dishonest"" film, since the REAL Demy comes out in his candy-colored, pastel-paradise films Parapluies de Cherbourg, Demoiselles de Rochefort, and this queer little adaptation of the fairy-tale classic ""Peau D'Ane"". I'll refer you to my Letterboxd review for specifics, but suffice it to say that it's a wonderful film that deserves a reappraisal today. Not only is it enchanting, filled with loving special-effects tributes to French magical realism Jean Cocteau, but it is also a fine piece of storytelling. For the PURENESS of the story and for seeing how a classic fairy-tale fits perfectly into the Demy aesthetic, Donkey Skin is worth tracking down. And the folks of Criterion have made it easy in their loving remaster of Donkey Skin in the must-have box-set The Essential Jacques Demy.     And now...here are some movies from LAST week!  Wild at Heart - Dave Lynch '90 - No star rating (but that may be a good thing...)  Wowzers, this is one of the weirdest movies I've had the (dis?)pleasure to see. I'm going to be honest: I have no fucking idea what David Lynch is trying to say with Wild at Heart. But (and you'll think me a nut for saying this) I perversely enjoyed it. In any case, I liked this more than Blue Velvet. Odd opinion, I know, but there ya go. BV does nothing for me; Wild at Heart at least pushes my buttons with scenes of Dernian abortions. Do those scenes have a point? No, but they get me thinking that, yeah, maybe they do. God knows I don't wish to pursue that point to its logical extreme, however.  Also, I find it hilarious that Roger Ebert led this movie's booing camp when it was awarded the Palme D'or in 1990. Really, Cannes people? There were no better movies at the festival in 1990? Maybe Ghost? /s  Inception - Chris Nolan '010 - ⋆⋆½  Meh. It may be an interesting concept, and I applaud Nolan for devoting 10 years of his life for this personal project. But I can't help feeling like the delivery leaves a little more than desired. It's like he was so focused with explaining the genius of his plot-twists and his mind-fuckery that he forgot the most important things that makes a movie enjoyable: a story. Empathetic characters (NOT speakpieces for boring explanatory dialogue). An interesting mystery.  I'm sure that the logic of the film can be summarized neatly, if with complex diagrams. I'm sure that, if one took the time to parse out any and every single plot movement of this film, one can solve its intricate mysteries. But when the entire POINT of your movie's existence is just solving that mystery and rattling off pseudo-insightful philosophical problems like ""Should I stay in dream limbo with my loved one""? Well, then, that movie's less than meets the eye.  Still enjoyed watching it with people who'd seen it many more times than I ever will.  Pitch Perfect 2 - ⋆½  Oh boy, just read my Letterboxd Review. Don't feel like mustering up any new emotions/memories of this.  Movie of the Week(s): Donkey Skin, it is!  EDIT: Added PP2."
TrueFilm,38wzky,totallywhatever,3,Mon Jun 8 02:33:15 2015 UTC,"Wild at Heart is one of my favorite Lynch works, but I agree that it's completely oddball nuts.  I agree with much of what you have said regarding Blue Velvet (although I do like it a bit more than it appears you did), but I think Wild at Heart is still a great, great work, certainly one deserving of the Palme d'Or if not simply to endow Lynch with a well-deserved award.  Although I would wager many of Lynch's works are personal, I think Wild at Heart may be one of the most personal, next to Eraserhead.  It's a film about passion, about love, and about our drives and desires.  It so obviously comes from a happier place within Lynch rather than the darker place he goes into with the LA trilogy (I still need to see Mulholland Dr.).  I equate it to a more humorous, lighthearted version of Badlands, one that embraces rather than rejects our Id-driven desires.  But I will say, I still need to work out the whole ""Wizard of Oz"" thing; that's pretty nuts.  Then again, it takes a lot of audacity to do it and I think it would be foolish to decry Lynch for incorporating such obviously silly metaphors into the work."
TrueFilm,38wzky,otherpeoplesmusic,3,Sun Jun 7 16:00:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can feel Lynch's investment in this project a lot. Only he would come up with scenes as nausea-inducing as the one where the robber's head explodes into millions of tiny little pieces, or even when Willem Dafoe repeatedly and violently asks Laura Dern to say ""Fuck me"" so that he can respond with, ""Sorry, ain't got the time!"" Again, it walks this very tight rope between offensive trash and twisted Southern gothic genius, but I am more than willing to give Lynch the benefit of the doubt that he knows what emotions he wants to inspire at any given point.  The Wizard of Oz angle is unnecessary, I feel, but it adds to the cluttered tapestry of an already wild film, so I wasn't too focused on that. I love that Laura Palmer from Twin Peaks plays Glinda the Good Witch."
TrueFilm,38wzky,NuStone,2,Sun Jun 7 17:03:14 2015 UTC,"I watched so many new movies this week. I’ve really been trying to catch up on the movies I’ve always wanted to see. I won’t have room or time to talk about them all in detail. I’ll talk about and rate all of them briefly but I’ll only talk heavily about the ones I really want or need to and I’ll try to keep those short. If I list one but don’t talk about how I feel much, go ahead and ask me in a comment if you’d really like to know.   Gangs of New York: After thinking about it afterwards, I honestly feel the main reason I enjoyed this movie was Daniel Day Lewis’ performance, he was phenomenal as always. But without him I probably would only give the movie a 6 or something. I usually love DiCaprio, but to me his performance wasn’t amazing in this, nor was some of the other actors’/actresses’ (maybe they were just all extremely overshadowed by Daniel Day Lewis though). The plot wasn’t amazing to me either. Other than some of the parts specifically about Bill the Butcher or the whole political subplot, it wasn’t that interesting to me at all. 8/10  Raging Bull: I love Scorsese and De Niro and I enjoy boxing so of course I loved this. There isn’t much I could say except that it was amazing, the acting, story, cinematography, everything. 10/10  The Maltese Falcon: Wonderful early Noir film. Simple, but amazing story, and great really acting. Humphrey Bogart especially was amazing. 9/10  Strangers on a Train: I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would, I’ve always heard people say its good, but I’ve also heard it’s one of the more basic Hitchcock movies. I absolutely loved Bruno, he’s probably one of my favorite Hitchcock characters now. The whole thing was very tense and the final confrontation on the Carousel was perfect. 9.5/10  John Wick: This was such a fun movie to me. It is what it is, a very simple but badass action movie. I mean that’s basically what it is, an ultimate badass on a revenge spree. It may not have much depth but it was very fun and I loved it. 8/10  Paths of Glory: I didn’t have any experience with early Kubrick before this. Everything before Dr. Strangelove was completely alien to me, and I’d never even heard anything about his movies before that, other than them existing. I wasn’t expecting it to be as good as his later ones honestly. But all I can say is wow. This is honestly one of the best war films I’ve ever seen, It may even be better than Kubrick’s later Full Metal Jacket in some ways. I loved the World War I setting (I’ve only seen a handful of films set in WWI before so it’s always nice to see one) and how it well portrays the futility of the trench warfare and the war politics of that time in general. Kirk Douglas and several of the other actors were great. And the cinematography was wonderful; I particularly loved the scene with the attack on the Ant Hill. 10/10  The Prestige: So I’ve mentioned in previous weeks I’ve been watching the early Nolan films, Following two weeks ago, and Memento last week. So I watched the Prestige finally, and it was truly amazing. From the beginning line, “Are you watching closely?” I was hooked. I love how I thought I was trying to find the twist, (that seemed like what the movie wanted) but I was so shocked at the end. Like the other wonderful line at the end “You want to be fooled.” The whole movie was basically a magic trick and I did want to be fooled. Despite my Nolan experience so far and my twist hunting I really didn’t want to know how it ended and I wanted to be amazed and I was. The acting was great, the story was great, the filming was great. 10/10  Blood Simple: Very good story and characters, something of a modern Noir movie and I enjoyed it a lot. I loved how almost everything in the movie stems from the characters really not wanting to communicate their problems and having no idea what’s going on. The characters are all wonderful and I especially loved the Private Investigator Visser. The cinematography was great. Maybe it’s just all the Hitchcock movies I’ve been watching but some parts, especially the second half of the movie fely very Hitchcock-y to me. 8/10  Blue Velvet: This was my first full movie experience with David Lynch. I was in a bit of a Noir mood this week (sadly I was busy Friday and missed TCM’s Noir marathon), and I’d heard this was good and I’d always wanted to get in to Lynch so I watched it. It was all so surreal and dreamlike and very... odd overall. I was hooked watching it but I really wasn’t sure what to think at the time. The acting was great, the story was wonderful and dark, the cinematography was very unique and phenomenal. But it wasn’t until after I watched it and I couldn’t stop thinking about it, that I really started to love it. I can’t explain everything, and I may need more experience with Lynch to fully understand everything. But I can say one thing that really stuck out that I loved about it after thinking it over; The story is so dark, I mean obviously, but it’s in such contrast with the bright and vibrant “perfect small town life” that it just seems impossible that things that dark can be happening. And that contrast is one of the things that really makes the movie amazing to me. If anyone can reccomend me more Lynch films to watch next that'd be great. 9.5/10  Citizen Kane: I’ve had so many opportunities to watch this movie in the past few years but I never did because I felt I wouldn’t like it much. Often regarded as one of the most influential and important movies ever made, and of course it was filmed and directed amazingly, and Orson Welles acting was great. But what really surprised me was how much I really enjoyed the story, and I really found myself caring about Kane and wondering if I really should. He was just a fascinating character and I actually really enjoyed the movie on top of its wonderful filmmaking achievements. 10/10  Dial M for Murder: Just like Strangers on a Train I’ve heard this was another very simple not amazing Hitchcock film before too and I really loved this one too of course. The acting and cinematography was great. The story was so intense and chilling that he almost totally got away with it all. But just like in Rope it felt like I was a part of the plan, and I really found myself not wanting him to get caught. It was great 9/10  North By Northwest: I was trying to watch all the Cary Grant Hitchcock’s and I watched this first on Thursday night but I was really busy on Friday and Saturday and only had time to watch one movie so I’ll have to put it off until next week. Of course this was amazing, it’s like Hitchcock made a more suspenseful early Bond film. I loved it all around. 10/10  Bottle Rocket (1996): Wes Anderson’s first full feature film was a lot better than I expected or heard people tell me it is. I’ve watched a few of Anderson’s newer films and thought I’d do what I’m did with Nolan and take a few of his I really want to watch and start at the beginning. I really liked this movie though. It wasn’t quite as whimsical or quirky as some of his later films, and I can see how that could upset the major fans of his later work, but I actually liked that about it. The story and characters were all great and fun and I enjoyed it. 8/10"
TrueFilm,38ynrn,ChrisMyrick,31,Sun Jun 7 23:28:45 2015 UTC,"There's probably no word I drop in conversation that makes me feel more pretentious for doing so--yet I think the word cinematic is an important to understand as a qualifier for helping identify good filmmaking. For me, when describing something as ""cinematic""--I mean that it is using all the tools of cinema at its disposal to create an experience as only films can offer. While obviously there is a lot of overlap between painting, theatre, photography (all the visual arts) and the auditory arts, cinema has always had the gift of being able to synthesize all the best of both worlds to create its own unique experience. So when I describe something as cinematic, I often think of those scenes or movies that feel like they could only be offered through film, and not say--a novel, a play, etc. One of my top three favorite movies is Leone's The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. And the final shootout is the definition of cinematic in my book:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LcVQJ4IBtM  This marriage of Morricone's score, gorgeous cinematography, compelling story, and top-notch editing that modulates the pacing and mood as to leave the viewer breathless--is something that simply cannot be translated as effectively in any other medium.   To contrast, although I do really love and enjoy something like Spielberg's Lincoln, this is not a movie I would point to as exceptionally ""cinematic""--as I feel like many of the emotions and feelings created by the story could be easily translated to theatre or another medium. Where this gets confusing, is that I would still describe the climactic sequence of the movie cutting back and forth to see which states voted, as cinematic.  To expand on this, ""cinematic"" has a more gray definition that I think can make it confusing to pin down at times. ""The Godfather"" story works exceptionally as a novel and had many of its emotions translated to similar, exceptional results as a film--but it is the editing of the baptism sequence with the music and the turn of Michael's character--that for me, would help realize and define how one translates something of a different medium into the medium of cinema; and therefore, making it feel cinematic.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfbYp9oaIT8"
TrueFilm,38ynrn,yarbs90,5,Sun Jun 7 23:59:39 2015 UTC,"For me, when describing something as ""cinematic""--I mean that it is using all the tools of cinema at its disposal to create an experience as only films can offer.   I feel like this sums up what I was trying to say much better than I could have. Thank you.  This makes me put even more weight on editing, because it seems to me to be the most truly unique aspect of film and what separates it from other mediums."
TrueFilm,38ynrn,WessyNessy,2,Mon Jun 8 08:06:17 2015 UTC,Yeah that's putting it perfectly. I came ready to give a list of things that are all just this. Well said
TrueFilm,38ynrn,Rex_Lee,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:03:45 2015 UTC,"I think - and this is just opinion - that cinematic includes everything you said, and also implies a little more emphasis on being visually beautiful as well. More attention given to composition, color etc. Making each frame an aesthetically pleasing photo in itself- only in a moving form."
TrueFilm,38ynrn,Queefism,10,Fri Jun 12 14:02:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the term's place is very useful at all within film-theory due to how vague it is (as the replies in this thread are trying to relate it to cinematography, editing etc). Edit: said replies disappeared  I think the term is most useful when we are looking at works in other mediums that use cinematic language to communicate (i.e cutscenes in video games). A video game that uses more cinematic language than another (say, Metal Gear Solid) can be seen as 'more' cinematic than something like Counter Strike, which uses little to no cinematic language at all.  So all in all, I see it as a broad term that encapsulates how film communicates and interacts with its audience. Perhaps it could be said that films that are more visual than literary are more cinematic now that I think about it."
TrueFilm,38xkfx,Flubby2,2,Sun Jun 7 18:22:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  I went to see Love & Mercy this weekend, and really wanted to like it.  The opening scene seemed very promising, and there are a lot of scattered elements about the film that are very good - Dano and Cusak's performances chief among them - but the pieces remained fragments.  The film never coalesced into a satisfying whole.  I still haven't groked the necessity for the split timeline.  At first, I thought maybe they were going to parallel Brian's relationship with his father with his relationship with Landy, but that seems a rather obvious point to make, and Brian's father is only intermittently in the section with Dano, while Landy lords over most scenes in the section with Cusak (and Giamatti's performance is just one-note villainy, there's no attempt at psychological complexity whatsoever).  Then, I thought that perhaps the filmmaker was trying to show a split between genius and insanity, to make a film out of the storied ""fine line"" - but, if that were the case, there was far too much insanity in the ""genius"" section (with Dano) and not enough compensating genius in the ""insanity"" section (with Cusak).    It also doesn't help that the director really has no flair for staging or composition.  One of the difficulties that comes with making a film about a great artist is that, in order to do it well, you need an artist of (if not equal) at least estimable stature to pull it off.  That's why good music biopics are so rare; you can't just have any old director making a film about Brian Wilson.   Furthermore, I think that the dual-era structure limited the filmmakers from telling the most interesting parts of the story for the sake of runtime. I'm something of a beach boys fan myself, and I'm fairly familiar with the story of Pet Sounds and Smile. One thing LOVE AND MERCY glosses over is the presence of The Beatles. Aside from the short (and in my opinion poorly handled - but that's beside the point) conversation about Rubber Soul around the campfire and the OS line about Paul McCartney liking God Only Knows, The Beatles aren't present at all.    This is a great point.  We get some scenes of Brian in the studio building his knew sounds, layer by layer, but we don't really have enough context to show why this was so different, so influential, so far removed from the norm of Rock N' Roll circa 1966.  I also think that the way the film presents Pet Sounds and the disappointment of Smile kinda unwittingly gives the short-shrift to the stuff the Beach Boys had recorded to that point.  Pet Sounds may be Brian Wilson's masterpiece, but the stuff he's been recording to that point, particularly The Beach Boys studio albums from late 64 to 65, is pretty amazing stuff as well.  From a production standpoint, Summer Days is already far more sophisticated than Rubber Soul.  If anything, it was the Fab Four who were playing catch-up in 65-66.    Even though the whole Landy storyline is interesting on a kind of tabloid level, I don't think it's really an essential part of who Brian Wilson is.  I wish they'd jettisoned it to focus on the many more interesting possibilities in his life."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,FancyPantsBlanton,60,Sat Jun 6 16:37:29 2015 UTC,"This makes the most sense to me. People don't leave a theater wishing the film was 6 hours longer, they are satisfied since the story was filled. But on netflix the story isn't finished until its finished. If anything this is more indicative of damage to cable television since there you have to wait a whole week, or 5 minutes between commercials. I see youtube and netflix hurting cable, not films or theatres."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,Ayadd,9,Sat Jun 6 18:45:06 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It has so much more to do with finding satisfying points to stop watching. Sherlock has no issue with an hour and a half runtime and house of cards has a fluctuating duration. At the same time, I could see a rebirth of short films. The rules that dictated the past are just no longer necessary.  Sitting in a movie theater, 2-3 hours is about the maximum time that people can remain comfortable but we may see longer feature films if new releases become available on demand at the same time they're released in theaters with cinema showings returning to intermissions typically found in live performances.   Creators are just finding more freedom in writing a story first versus having to fit stories into a set 30 or 60 minute show that accounts for periodic commercial breaks."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,Oo0o8o0oO,4,Sat Jun 6 22:03:28 2015 UTC,"I agree, and extremes are also more suited to casual viewings like a weekend or work break, whereas a feature film is more suitable for group enjoyment, even if it's not in a theater"
TrueFilm,38t6yc,ikahjalmr,7,Sun Jun 7 01:18:45 2015 UTC,"People don't binge TV shows because they want a complete story.  TV programmes usually/used to be broadcast once a week. They needed to build in mechanisms, usually plot hooks and cliffhangers, to get people to come back after a whole week to watch the next episode - each episode is constructed to create a strong desire to watch the next.  When you give someone access to all of the episodes at once, the compulsion to watch the next episode that they engineered into the format is almost irresistable. It's not any kind of desire on the part of the watcher, it's just some dark arts scripting that compels people to keep going. People usually enjoy indulging the compulsion, but the techniques that create it don't have any artistic or entertainment merit on their own."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,comport,4,Sun Jun 7 01:47:39 2015 UTC,"That may be, but I'd say more often than not, they write them to appeal to our need for closure, specifically by using cliff hangers and reveals that cut to credits. They give us non-closure, so that we keep coming back for the closure. That's why the crescendo of the episode is usually at the end, because after the crescendo there is no resolve, which leaves it unfulfilled (what happens now?!?) But the best reason I have for my argument, I haven't told you yet, so ...stay tuned to find out!"
TrueFilm,38t6yc,pancakethief,4,Sun Jun 7 13:30:45 2015 UTC,TV did kill off the newsreel
TrueFilm,38t6yc,danthemango,3,Tue Jun 9 00:39:01 2015 UTC,"In a way.   The newsreel simply took a better form. It wasn't a matter of changing the basic concept of it, rather, moving it to a different metric. You can get exactly what a newsreel can give you within TV, and even more through the Youtube metric."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,CCPirate,2,Sun Jun 7 09:43:06 2015 UTC,"Also people binge watch TV because of the cheap business model. $9 for a month of TV, depending on how much free time you have you could possibly watch 150 hours of TV in that month. That's the whole of Breaking Bad and Mad Men easily, perhaps even half of the Sopranos. It's just so insanely cheap and easy to do, its less than a minute from your kitchen so you can watch or even migrate there before/during/after your dinner and its probably less than a minute from there to bed. You can absolutely cram your free time with it as you want as opposed to waiting in line for tickets, driving/going out to the cinema, meeting up with friends maybe, going through half an hour of ads on top of the running time, etc."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,twersx,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:56:41 2015 UTC,"100% back this. It's easy to say ""well people like the short stuff better, because generation attention spans, MTV, blah blah blah."" If it's quality, it's quality. period. People know what's worth their time and what isn't."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,WessyNessy,0,Sun Jun 7 14:50:06 2015 UTC,that's all because people had to physically act them out as well as actually be there to watch them be performed.There's nothing about the 2 hr mark for storytelling other than that's what some people have become used to.
TrueFilm,38t6yc,IvanLyon,4,Mon Jun 8 17:05:12 2015 UTC,"I don't get what actors on film sets has to do with it. As soon as the film camera was invented, film actors were not recreating the scene time and time again in real life; it was played back on film.  As for the audience, they continued to rough it for a few years. You had to sit in an audience of some kind, with stresses and ablutions to attend. You don't have to do that watching S4 of Arrested Development in one go on your sofa. You can put up with a lot more."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,IvanLyon,6,Sat Jun 6 19:49:13 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing my point? I'm just referring to your two hour thing being simply all that an actor would willingly do again and again night after night, and all that a potential audience would be willing to sit through. As soon as those performances can take advantage of a film camera, the performers don't have to keep performing in order to be seen, no? So the two hour 'limit' disappears from the performer's side of the bargain, at least. Clooney doesn't have to act out Ocean's Eleven every time it's ever shown."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,IvanLyon,3,Sat Jun 6 22:49:12 2015 UTC,"I get it. But i'm not saying there's an optimal length. Stories were as long as profitability allowed them to be. Now that technology allows you to sit at home and get charged for being told that story (be it audiobook, play, TV show, film, etc) they can be longer and still be relatively profitable. The limitations are no longer physical (not live performers, you don't have to sit in a theatre seat) and they still get to charge you money. They can probably be as long as they need to be. Film or television makers not having to factor in piss breaks or buttnumbing can only be a good thing. There never was an optimal story length, it was just the best compromise between production, profit and comfort."

TrueFilm,38t6yc,IvanLyon,6,Sat Jun 6 23:20:42 2015 UTC,"Nah, the audience also has to physically sit there for that long. And presumably do something else that day. So it's not that different on that side of it."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,lordhadri,43,Sat Jun 6 23:33:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think people will stop liking movies so as long as someone remembers how to make them and there are theaters to see them in I think they will get made in the format that's worked for them for so long.  But as a commercial entertainment format, yeah, it might go obsolete. Currently 2 hour movies are the 'tentpole' for mass culture and aren't moviemaking for its own sake. This the entertainment complex that makes them isn't really in the movie business, it's in the toys and t-shirts business. So almost every movie that's a big hit is like this now, the rest is art cinema and niche genres.  This state of affairs probably won't go on forever. I'm indifferent to the effect that will have on filmmaking as arts&entertainment because it won't be that different from how it already is. What's hard to predict is what the movie theaters will do to survive in the long run.  I wouldn't make a big deal about 'YouTube attention spans' either. The best creativity on YouTube isn't so different from what early short filmmakers could do. There isn't a space for short filmmaking in the world of commercial theaters anymore so there wasn't a way for people who wanted to do it to reach mass audiences until the internet came along. That's a good thing."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,lordhadri,15,Sat Jun 6 23:47:51 2015 UTC,"Generally, I expect to see the lengths of movies drift a little more towards the extremes, but not much. More pronounced will be the blurring between ""TV"" and ""Movie"".   An episode of Sherlock is 90 minutes, for example, and I think it's worth pointing out Top of the Lake, which is ostensibly a 7-episode miniseries, but which was originally screened all at once, with an intermission.   The biggest difference is screening location (couch versus theater), so while there will probably always be a market for the 2h30 blockbuster type thing, it's hard to say if it'll be big enough to keep theaters around indefinitely."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,yeartwo,6,Sat Jun 6 23:53:47 2015 UTC,"Sherlock isn't really part of a trend though, it's a relatively common thing for british mystery series (and to a lesser extent, American ones) to be feature-length. Look at the runtimes of Ms. Marple, A Touch of Frost or Poirot. It is significant that America seems to be embracing this though."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,Falolizer,4,Sun Jun 7 00:24:48 2015 UTC,"No, there is a difference, and you know it when you see it. The cost structure and production system is different between something like Sherlock and Star Trek Into Darkness. We see creators comfortable in one medium transferring to the next, like Campion and Soderbergh and Whedon, but that doesn't mean it's a sustained trend.  People complain all the time that the blurring is in terms of visual style as bigger movies try less and some TV shows allegedly try more. But I think the way you tell a story in these mediums is fundamentally different. We may see the entertainment complex rely more on television to reach the mass audience in the future, that's all. It might even be a good thing since clearly something like Game of Thrones can find a wider (and older) audience as a TV show than PG-13 sword&sorcery genre movies ever do."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,lordhadri,0,Sun Jun 7 01:33:42 2015 UTC,"Well theater attendance is up despite every other art medium losing patronage over the past several years, I don't think it's going anywhere short term.  It's in the best interest of both studios and theaters to keep films short since shorter lengths = more screenings per day = more money, longer films tend to be prestige films that don't make a ton of money anyway.  Plus I think there I some truth that audiences don't like films being too long...we talk about binge watching shows but you can still get up to use the bathroom or make a sandwich or check Facebook when you're watching TV at home; movie theaters more or less demand your undivided attention.  On the other hand, I think there's an expectation that you get your money's worth when you go to the theater.  A 2.5 hour film is a better deal than a 1.5 hour film if both are equally enjoyable.  I wonder whether films drifting towards the short end might mean theaters end up restructuring their prices."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,keyboredcats,4,Sun Jun 7 07:16:03 2015 UTC,Theater attendance is up?
TrueFilm,38t6yc,lordhadri,6,Sat Jun 6 23:24:17 2015 UTC,Not sure what he's talking about. 2014 theater attendance was a 20-year low.
TrueFilm,38t6yc,tonequality,6,Sat Jun 6 16:53:59 2015 UTC,It always changes with time. In the 80s the sweet spot seemed to be an hour and thirty minutes. Ages ago you'd get a ninety minute feature with but stuck between. I'd imagine it just evolves with time.
TrueFilm,38t6yc,soykommander,4,Sat Jun 6 21:16:41 2015 UTC,A lot of the hour thirty run time had to do with how popular cable was getting then. Watching movies on TV was starting to take off and that time is the sweet spot so when shown with ads it's a full two hour block.
TrueFilm,38t6yc,xSepulcherx,7,Sun Jun 7 04:21:52 2015 UTC,"I think ""gravitating"" toward ten hour binges is a bit of an exaggeration.  Also, there is evidence that interrupting an activity (such as a television series) causes better memory of that activity.  I personally have also found this to be true which is one reason why I would not bet on such a binging trend becoming dominant."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,PikachuSnowman,7,Sun Jun 7 04:26:01 2015 UTC,"I actually credit home TV-binging (both netflix and, before that, dvd box sets) with attention spans for movies generally getting longer. Not only is the slow cinema movement more popular than ever (""it's just like watching a miniseries all at once"" said one friend of a Lav Diaz film) but even big blockbusters seem to be sprawling out in length."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,Tropolist,12,Sun Jun 7 03:40:58 2015 UTC,"Obsolete? No. There will always be stories to tell that fit better in an hour and a half to two and a half hour runtime. I'm not talking about the SFX blockbusters. I'm talking about things like Gravity, All Is Lost, Fury Road, Coherence, The One I Love, etc.  Mark Harris over at Grantland has made a case that blockbuster franchise movies are a bigger threat to the overall health of the movies.   Yes, good movies sprout up, inevitably, in the cracks and seams between the tectonic plates on which all of these franchises stay balanced, and we are reassured of their hardiness. But we don’t see what we don’t see; we don’t see the effort, or the cost of the effort, or the movies of which we’re deprived because of the cost of the effort. Paul Thomas Anderson’s Inherent Vice may have come from a studio, but it still required a substantial chunk of outside financing, and at $35 million, it’s not even that expensive. No studio could find the $8.5 million it cost Dan Gilroy to make Nightcrawler. Birdman cost a mere $18 million and still had to scrape that together at the last minute. Imagine American movie culture for the last few years without Her or Foxcatcher or American Hustle or The Master or Zero Dark Thirty and it suddenly looks markedly more frail — and those movies exist only because of the fairy godmothership of independent producer Megan Ellison. The grace of billionaires is not a great business model on which to hang the hopes of an art form.   We're approaching the point where only huge budget films or sequels to proven hits and those with shoestring budgets will be made, with perhaps half a dozen, or fewer, mid-range projects from each studio coming at the end of the year for awards season. Studios are after the largest profit and that method gives them the best chance to make the most money every year. I'm not sure how this gets fixed and, sadly, I'm not sure the studios would want to change from this method."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,Erigion,4,Sun Jun 7 04:33:12 2015 UTC,"He's assuming that those movies are only made to win awards, though, and I don't think that's true. I disagree that ""American movie culture"" would be much worse off without the movies he listed. Worse off, yes, as those were mostly great movies he gave there (couldn't enjoy American Hustle for whatever reason, even though I like Russell and all of the cast), but that's kind of assuming that all the other movies that came out weren't good. Let me throw some names at you: Whiplash. Mad Max: Fury Road. Prisoners. Nebraska. Blue is the Warmest Color. Ida. Under the Skin. I barely scratched the surface of the movies released in the last few years and I think every single one of those movies is as good as at least one of the movies he mentioned (not counting American Hustle, of course, because that would be unfair).  Now, about budgets:  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Universal_Pictures_films  Look at the movies that Universal released since 2010. You'll notice that Zero Dark Thirty is one of them. As are Man of Tai Chi, The World's End, Paul, Rush, and A Walk Among the Tombstones. That's a pretty good summarization of their catalogue for the last five years: action movies, comedies made for an established audience, and movies made with more than average amounts of artistic value. Throw in movies like Battleship, Anna Karenina, and Hop for a bit more diversification (in terms of budget and appeal). Battleship, obviously, leads the budget-pack with $220 million. Anna Karenina and The World's End are at the back with $20 million each. Zero Dark Thirty had a budget of $40 million, as did Paul. Rush was $38 million and Hop was $63 million. Man of Tai Chi and A Walk Among the Tombstones are kind of off by themselves with $25 million and $28 million respectively (I don't consider those small budget or middle-budget). My point is that middle-budget movies haven't really gone anywhere.   The point the writer there seems to be trying to make is that middle-budget movies have value that big- and small-budget movies don't, which isn't true. How much money it took to make a movie shouldn't determine its worth at all. A $300 million action blockbuster has every chance to be just as good as a $10 million independent arthouse movie which has every chance to be just as good as a $50 million drama from a studio. What matters is the quality of the product that the budget goes towards creating. Adjusted for inflation, Apocalypse Now cost about as much to make as San Andreas, and was a lot more than Entourage."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,usabfb,5,Sun Jun 7 07:33:03 2015 UTC,"That movies are only being made to win awards is not his assumption. That's my assumption due to the fact that those types of movies get a decent to big box office bump by just being nominated for the big end of year awards. It's a matter of probability and quantity:  A) Blockbuster Movie A costs $150-200 million to make and has a decent chance to approach $1 billion in revenue. Subtract the usual x2 marketing cost and you're looking at ~$500 million or more in profit. B) Summer/Early fall Movie B costs $40 million to make and makes $100 million. Subtract the x2 marketing cost and the revenue the studio makes is an accounting error. C) Oscar Bait Movie C costs $25 million to make and makes $180 giving you $130 million in profit. And you might be able to get away with minimal marketing because awards season does it for you.  Why wouldn't studios choose to make Movie A and C exclusively given that those types of movies are the ones that will make them the most money most of the time?  About those movies you listed. While Prisoners is a type B movie, the kind of movie that is disappearing from Hollywood studio portfolios. Whiplash and Nebraska were purchased for distribution during festivals and definitely held for release until awards season. I'm not sure why you mention Fury Road, Blue is the Warmest Color, Ida, and Under the Skin as they're all from foreign production companies. The latter three were made for very little money and one didn't even make back its budget. His article is about the movies Hollywood studios are making. Bringing us back to his assumption, which is:   If you asked a bunch of executives without a creative bone in their bodies to craft a movie lineup for which the primary goal is to prevent failure, this is exactly what the defensive result would look like. It’s a bulwark that has been constructed using only those tools with which they feel comfortable — spreadsheets, P&L statements, demographic studies, risk-avoidance principles, and a calendar. There is no evident love of movies in this lineup, or even just joy in creative risk. Only a dread of losing.   And   The grace of billionaires is not a great business model on which to hang the hopes of an art form.   The budget talk flat out ignores what I quoted from his article. It also don't take into account where the budget is coming from, foreign and indie companies. It also don't take into account that Universal was the co-producer or even only distributor for many recent movies on that list. But don't take my word for it, take John Waters, Steven Soderbergh, Spike Lee, David Lynch at theirs.   And no, the author is not trying to say that mid-range movies have more value than big and small budget films. He's saying that they have equal value but because it doesn't make financial sense to them, Hollywood studios would love to pawn off all of the mid-range movies to foreign and small production companies. And yes, some of those mid-range movies will be made by the grace of a few billionaires but many won't. This does no good for film as a whole. Film lovers are worse off for it."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,Erigion,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:55:35 2015 UTC,"Well let's be fair to Fury Road, it is a foreign-produced B-movie that Warner Brothers inexplicably paid $150 million to put their logo in front of. It's a perfect example of one of those movies Harris is talking about. It made me a little sad because it reminded me that none of the action movie directors working for major studios and are under 50 years old know how to make a movie like that, so maybe soon nobody will."

TrueFilm,38t6yc,lordhadri,2,Sat Jun 6 22:25:36 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter if people saw the original, it's the IP that matters not the actual films. Brand awareness alone is a leg up in terms of marketing. Add to that the built-in audience that saw at least one of the originals and you easily have more viewers than you would if you started with a fresh concept.   I'm going to just label it a reboot, it doesn't really matter anyway..."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,mantasis,0,Sat Jun 6 20:01:17 2015 UTC,"He's assuming that those movies are only made to win awards, though, and I don't think that's true.   Even if it isn't, the actual Academy Awards are acting like it. Alternatives to the franchise-plex struggle to get made and seen and get rewarded with nominations at the Oscars out of self-loathing. This is the only way to account for Birdman's Best Picture win. If the Academy voters couldn't form a consensus around any of the five nominated films that were trying to be more than awards-bait, they should have given it to Guardians of the Galaxy by acclamation. It would have made a lot more sense. But the studios know they can't actually get away with promoting movies like that as the best of the year to the major awards shows. (Though I recall Paramount did that with Transformers 4 as some kind of strategic joke.)   And seriously, the small foreign productions that catch fire with American arthouse audiences aren't going to save us. We have six companies in the United States that finance most of the movies anybody is going to see. Columbia has made a single good movie in the last three years (American Hustle) and is probably finished off for good. Disney has mastered making money from mediocrity, even in both its animation labels. The remainder are teetering on the brink here and it's possible that any or all of them are completing whatever was already in the pipeline and will not be financing  anything else in the future that's not a franchise movie. We've already seen the dispiriting death of genres that used to be reliable like romantic comedy, action movies and suspense thrillers with science fiction looking like it's soon to follow, so we can't even rely on those for diversity.   IIRC Universal is the black sheep of the pack. They're the only one that has managed to do well lately without exclusively making expensive blockbustery movies. But, they obviously really want to play in that ballpark, they just don't have anything anyone cares about outside of Fast&Furious and Jurassic Park. Which they are planning to make indefinitely."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,lordhadri,4,Sat Jun 6 21:12:56 2015 UTC,"The movies won't change (or rather, they will change but they won't go away), but the venues absolutely will. Netflix Binges and Youtube Clips happen when you're lazing around at home or hanging out with friends and family. They're delivered to you anywhere, any time, on any device you want. Movies are still more restrictive than they should be in that regard, and often when you want to see something, you have to go to the theater.   Movies are still made with the big screen as their primary exhibition target. If you're watching on your TV at home you're not getting the intended experience. Though I hope this doesn't happen, I believe movies will start to change to target the living room as their primary exhibition space, and you do things differently when that is your goal. So while we'll still have 2-hour features, they won't be like the movies we have today."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,dccorona,4,Sat Jun 6 22:37:20 2015 UTC,"I think in general films these days are way too long. A movie like transformers doesn't need to be hitting the two and a half hour mark, for something like that 100 minutes should be sufficient. So many movies suffer from.bloat these days.   I remember an interview with Danny Boyle about trainspotting saying he had a rule to keep the movie to 90minutes saying the book had so much in it that it would be easy to get carried away. And it was a.good thing, that movie has an amazing pace to it, it's tight, well edited and you never slumps. Too many movies have the slump in the middle and.the false ending."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,cloudstaring,2,Sun Jun 7 04:51:16 2015 UTC,I'm going to say no just because movie theaters are an excuse to get out of the house which is still something people feel the urge to do no matter how reclusive on their netflix binges.
TrueFilm,38t6yc,Pentay,2,Sun Jun 7 22:05:30 2015 UTC,It's really hard to make ten hours of good content. That's why TV shows can become repetitive. Also one minute isn't enough to work with to produce something fulfilling. I think history has proven that ~1.5-3 hours is a good balance.
TrueFilm,38t6yc,jugular_majesty,2,Sun Jun 7 22:16:25 2015 UTC,"it won't become obsolete, it'll just become the place where people go to watch big explosions and SFX happenings. Considering the relative costs, anything remotely dramatic or procedural just has to go to long-form. It's (at least relatively) cheaper and you get more time for drama/tension/suspense/actually telling the story.   Look at some of the best films over the last twenty years. It's only the tentpoles that wouldn't be better served by a miniseries HBO kind of version. To take a lowest-denominator, imagine Shawshank as a ten parter. The fim was great, but the show could just as easily been ten episodes that were just as good just by adding the stuff that was great but got cut because of the time constraints involved in getting films to a cinema and making it profitable. Shawshank in the current miniseries climate would probably be a massive success. Many previous films would be. Just about the only property that wouldn't be better served by long-form would be the 'blockbuster' SFX extravaganza, and it seems there'll always be a market for that, to the point where the cinema may be its only domain."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,IvanLyon,5,Sun Jun 7 22:42:04 2015 UTC,"I disagree; I think that television and film are two extremely different formats, and that just because there's been great dramatic television doesn't mean that all dramatic film would've been better served as a serialized and extended product.   Television, as a writer's medium, is inherently more narrative; however, this does not necessarily mean better. Being succinct and telling a story as efficiently as possible is something that I think all art should strive for. Some stories are much better suited to a longer format: Mad Men, for example, would be a horrible two hour film that would never fully make its point about the way in which the sixties irrevocably changed America. Conversely, Under the Skin would be tedious as all fuck past the second episode--another story about personal change and growth, yes, but one inherently suited to the runtime in which it exists.  Modern culture has gotten us into this weird dichotomy where we can only have MORE or LESS--never just enough. Just because there's MORE story in television doesn't mean there's necessarily BETTER story, much like how a movie having a bigger budget doesn't mean that it'll be used more intelligently."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,TheAustinKnight,5,Sun Jun 7 05:17:19 2015 UTC,"A lot of people on reddit, it seems like, push for every movie they ever enjoyed to get a mini-series on TV because they assume that it would keep the same level of quality throughout. Movies like Under The Skin and even The Shawshank Redemption wouldn't work that way because their stories don't rely on plot, but carefully before considered character moments. Think Andy doing everyone's taxes. That works in the movie, but would you really want to see an episode of that? Think the old guy leaving prison and not knowing what to do with himself. It was exactly as emotionally impactful of a moment as it needed to be. Think Johansson's alien staring at the people drown. We don't need more moments like that to realize she's disconnected from humanity. Expanding on the moments already in the movie would only cheapen their importance, and I doubt that many movies film enough content (that is usable, quality-wise) to make them into mini-series anyways. If they've got three or four hours of film, they can just release a long movie."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,usabfb,0,Sat Jun 6 21:21:41 2015 UTC,"you're assuming that they'd be making a longer version of the film version of Shawshank. I'm talking about making a long form version of the original novella. The film was a very condensed version of the story, which is my point.   Not that it lends anything to my argument, but I certainly could imagine an episode of this 'Shawshank' given over to Andy doing taxes. I wouldn't say it was warranted, but i've seen any number of TV shows devote an episode to something that was probably filler and get away with it.   The Johansson film sounds like it's exactly as long as it needed to be. If it had original material from which you could generate more footage from, then cool. If it's just something that was borne from the actual filming process itself, maybe you just have ninety minutes of content and it's not meant to be any more than that.  edit: we're going to get a great example with Fukunaga's 'It'. A 3 to 4 hour adaptation of a much longer work. Someone who watches this - unaware of all the sacrificed plot - would imagine a ten episode adaptation as just being what they've just seen but stretched out twice as long. Unless you know the source material, you're unaware. Same with the original scripts of what become some of our most loved films."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,IvanLyon,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:57:09 2015 UTC,"films for the most part are a compromise, They're the best assembly of footage that tells a coherent story within a runtime that allows more showings per theatre.   I agree that longer doesn't necessarily equate to being better, not for everything. There are plenty of films that I could add to my list other than the usual blockbusters. By all means, make  something the length you feel it should be. But that's certainly not how it's been for the last century of film, narrative is pretty much always the first casualty. If film/TV makers are given the choice (and there's no perceived loss of stature/significant financial difference, etc), i'd imagine most would choose the longer format. Unless you're tailored to the shorter one, for the reasons we've already mentioned. Obviously, there are exceptions. I'm not sure that we're not actually on the same side of this one."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,IvanLyon,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:10:47 2015 UTC,No.    A story can be told in many different forms and in many different timeframes.  It doesn't have to adhere to any singular blueprint.  I like that there are varied running times for feature films.  I've enjoyed an 88 min. feature just as much as I've enjoyed a 188 minute feature.  It all depends on the quality of the film and how the story is told.  I also enjoy watching series and youtube shorts.
TrueFilm,38t6yc,kdk12k2k12,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:42:34 2015 UTC,"No, because it serves a niche; an entire story fits within two hours.  What makes modern television great is that almost any show can now do what a Mini-Series used to be needed for. You know, those things that were rare, almost never shown, and often played by their own rules? Well, it's more standardized, but you can at least string together a complete story now without needing to plan it all out first and have a movie-sized budget.  Netflix Binges occur because of the lack of commitment. If you watch three episodes and then get bored, or need to stretch, or have to pee, or just get bored because it's a slow point in the story, you can stop and come back to it. The creators put in a specific spot for you to stop, and when the next episodes starts they're assuming you may have forgotten some things. Good writers will reintroduce concepts and characters without treating you like an idiot.  Movies don't have that advantage. They assume you're in for one sitting. For some reason, when people think ""two hours, that's a long time to commit"", they won't watch it. But they'll watch five 40-minute-long episodes, knowing they can stop at any time. It's less of a commitment, at least mentally.  But they can have a complete arc, beginning and end. And now, there's no excuse for people who want to tell a sweeping epic to try and cram too much into one movie. They can go pitch a TV show and write it for a few years.   It's a different medium. It's not going anywhere. Right now it's in ""trouble"" because Netflix works better for shows than for movies. Give it some time, and movies will re-align themselves to adjust for the changing market. Maybe, if we're lucky, it will mean more longer movies. In for a penny, in for a pound, right?"

TrueFilm,38t6yc,mltronic,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:08:24 2015 UTC,"Movies and cinema will always exist. Watching serialized narratives on TV is a different type of storytelling more close to reading a novel where you check in with a bunch of characters you already know whenever you have the time to sit and watch it.  A movie is more a self-contained experience, whether you are going to a theater to watch it with friends and talk about the movie over food afterwards or sitting together on a couch showing that copy of Fargo you have on Blu-ray to that one person you know who hasn't seen it. I always love filling in cinematic blind spots with friends, everyone discovers new favorite movies from that.  The only thing that really worries me is the emergence of shared universe films. I really doubt the plot of Avengers: Age of Ultron would make sense at all to anyone who saw that as their first Marvel movie. With every studio quickly scrambling to make their own elaborate series of films, it starts to feel more like television you're watching every few months in a movie theater than it does an actual film at that point."
TrueFilm,38t6yc,coldermilk,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:29:49 2015 UTC,"I've had some family and friends talk about how superior serialized narrative is relative to standalone feature films and I can't find the argument very compelling. I think that certain kinds of media lend themselves better to certain formats--book series or comics, for example, are much better suited for TV than film in my opinion. As far as feature-length films, I think the what is going to change in the next 5 years is the turn around from theatrical release to DVD, studios are going to have change how they approach streaming services like Netflix--either have good working relationships with them or have a superior service through their own company websites. I think youtube has changed how people think about time, certainly. A video podcast or a twitch stream is a very different experience than a vine or a music video. I think shorts have benefited from youtube and other online video services that people would otherwise be oblivious to, and that has been a boon for aspiring filmmakers who don't have access to studios."

TrueFilm,38q0u4,RamblingandRanting,103,Fri Jun 5 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"As a composer I'm afraid I have to say I agree. It's a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. Composers started to use samples more and more often, leading directors to believe that music is something very easy and cheap, which leads to music budgets being cut and composers being forced to use samples. But not only that, there is also less time for music. Especially with TV series getting more and more popular, they require music for a whole season to be composed in pretty much a few weeks. Which then sets a standard for other parts of the industry, too.  What he says about music being allowed to be less and less expressive hit me the most. He's spot on. I noticed that the most expressive music I compose keeps being cut from the final film, or changed. And not only that, the music is sometimes being mixed so softly that it might as well not be there. Everything needs to be spherical and certainly not be present too much.  It's a trend, but luckily there are still many directors (although usually an older generation) who do get the true value of music. And in my personal experience too, I noticed that older generation directors know a lot more about which music exists and the way music works in film.  I went to a music school where many of the students wanted to be a media or film composer. And they all want to write the quick staccato strings, which is very easy to do with samples, but not with real musicians. Orchestra's just don't sound the way they do in most films, but people (composers and audiences) are getting used to it.  If anyone is interested, coincidentally I actually wrote a little article about the use of samples, just a few days ago, in an attempt to educate some directors: http://www.basbouma.nl/its-the-same-but-it-really-isnt/  EDIT: I'm not sure about what Morricone means with ""Electronic instruments flatten everything"", by the way. Electronic instruments like synthesizers and samples can be used in many interesting and creative ways."
TrueFilm,38q0u4,Whitebunneh,20,Fri Jun 5 22:07:17 2015 UTC,"This is pretty cool to hear from a composer actively engaged in this area. Thanks for sharing! Just to possibly clarify the point about electronic instruments, I think he is referring to electronic instruments and programs simulating the sounds of acoustic instruments.  You can have the most amazing sound sample library, but it will never be the same as working with a real orchestra.  That said, you raise an excellent point about how electronic instruments that are not meant to replicate acoustic instruments can be used very creatively.  If the time and care is put into it, some very powerful, interesting, and evocative timbres can be made with electronic instruments."
TrueFilm,38q0u4,5150RED,5,Sat Jun 6 00:03:26 2015 UTC,"In response to your edit, I think Ennio Morricone himself used synthesizers in interesting ways and for a while was the master of electronic instruments. A lot of his famous tracks include synth."
TrueFilm,38q0u4,buildbyflying,10,Sat Jun 6 20:46:47 2015 UTC,"In defense of directors choosing to tone down music, the amount of subtlelty required in all facets of filmmaking, including camerawork and lighting have always held sway in some circles. I personally choose in some instances to bring in music softly as to create a mood as cinematographer chooses to blend light, or the editor chooses to edit without drawing the audience out of the experience. That's not to say there aren't plenty of films and tv shows that can properly use a booming score."
TrueFilm,38q0u4,Whitebunneh,6,Sat Jun 6 02:06:50 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Sometimes the composer has to be that 'chameleon' as well. But like you said I think it should be a conscious decision, instead of a default one. To me, many directors seem to be very focused on the image, and they often don't have a vision for the audio and music, in the way they do for the image, which is very understandable. But when you make bolt choices in the editing, lighting or camera, why not think in the same way for music and audio? In the end you wants to convey something, and how do you do that most effectively? I don't think the music has to be booming at all, but sometimes it should be allowed to just be there."

You would obviously know better than I, especially with regard to the contemporary landscape, but if that is in fact true, its a great disservice. All the best films I can think of had amazing scores that makes those films even better than what they would have been without.   Thank you for the insight, however disheartening. I'd like to think on some level people can really tell a difference (and not just film enthusiasts) even if they aren't entirely conscientious of it.  Finally, what happens when Morricone, Williams, and the rest of the old guard finally pass on? Just out of curiosity, in your estimation do you see any continuation of live orchestration? Albeit complex, time consuming, and costly, there is no substitute (that is to say, when contextually appropriate of course), and I recognize that even though I personally really enjoy (some) electronic music."

I was also very impressed by the soundtrack for Enemy, although there's a lot of underscoring (relatively subtle soundscapes) too.   Dario Marianelli's score for Atonement was very good in a classical sort of way.

TrueFilm,38q0u4,paranoiajack,9,Sat Jun 6 00:23:33 2015 UTC,That's probably the best news I've heard about the stand alone films yet. Desplat and Clint Mansell are my two favorite noon John Williams film composers working right now (with honerable mention to Bear McCreary Wii I would like to see get a shot at a Star Wars or Star Trek film).  I think they biggest things these composers have over a lot of other ones is melody. There doesn't seem to be a lot of that in film scores these days.
TrueFilm,38q0u4,eliphas_levi,7,Sat Jun 6 05:15:59 2015 UTC,"directors don’t respect the role of the composer   I'm reminded of something Christopher Nolan said in an interview about editing; that he always edits without music because otherwise, if you edit a clip to music and remove the music, ""the shot you held for a few more beats starts to feel awkward..."" (I am paraphrasing from memory here)  If it's this kind of thinking that Morricone feels is disrespectful, then I might agree with him. A film is an audiovisual experience. But I really think Morricone is giving himself (and other composers) too much credit when he says that a movie can work because there's a very good score. An incompetently directed film can't be rescued by the score.    showing what you cannot see   Yet again, this is the director's job, to show what is necessary on the screen. All music can really do in a film is enhance the emotional impact of a scene, or build atmosphere. As long as scores can do that, then I don't see an issue. The film's music doesn't even have to be a score, look at how existing classical music was used in 2001: A Space Odyssey, or The Shining, or more recently Shutter Island. So again, Morricone thinks the composer is important... but a composer often isn't even needed. I really don't think that modern composers or sound editors are less competent than they were 60 years ago. If anyone is blaming TV for the decline in standards, then I'll point towards Fargo and Hannibal as counterexamples."

Film is, and will always be, primarily, a visual medium. Everything else is gravy.   The best example is ""No Country For Old Men."" Most people don't realize there's a lack of music in the film. That alone shows how good storytelling can be without music in film."
TrueFilm,38q0u4,eliphas_levi,4,Sat Jun 6 16:34:45 2015 UTC,"That's probably not the best example since there's non-diegetic sound in No Country for Old Men.

It's used in the same way music is used in any film so I'd go as far as calling it a ""score"".   Listen closely from 3:20 onwards.

There is a moment in the film where there is a relatively long piece of music, when the main character Llewelin tries to find a motel to stay. Why did you decide to use a relatively long piece of music at this place? Is it purely to provide the continuity between the scenes or is the music telling something else about the story aswell?  CB: ""You're right that it was partly to provide continuity. It's a section of the film that consists of a lot of ""shoe leather"" - meaning people are moving around but not interacting - and we wanted to suggest that the drama was building nonetheless.""  The music in the film often accompanies a dialogue. Why did you decide to use music under dialogue?  CB: ""No conscious effort was made to accompany dialogue.  Largely the music is present to augment tension, but it may also be underlining subtext in dialogue, as in the gas station scene."""

Many of my most favorite films tell a story of massive depth.  I can remove the sound, remove the specific actors, and still entirely change my life based on the understanding I get from that film.  Just like a William Shakespeare play - I can change out the actors and the stage - and still really gain something from a story."

Of course, people who watch the films like it but they like it because of the cheesy Tarantino factor...which can be incredibly irritating to the composer, who feels disrespected his work has reduced to some cheap effect.  In that sense, there's no respect for the composer.  You just add music and make it loud.  Audience likes it but it has no meaningful impact on them (Oh yeah?  That's the song from Kill Bill right?  QT is a genius!).  Compare this with Sergio Leone...who knew how to use the composer to build tension.   And who communicated regularly with Ennio.  EDIT: Another good recent example is Mad Max: FR.  The guitar character (diagetic, in world) being used to supplement the movie soundtrack (non diagetic).  Of course, Miller comes from an older generation, too so maybe it's a generational thing."

TrueFilm,38q0u4,Duck-You-Sucker,5,Sun Jun 14 10:47:18 2015 UTC,"Morricone is giving other composers too much credit but not himself. Dude's scored hundreds of movies and very rarely does a poor job.

TrueFilm,38q0u4,Whitebunneh,3,Sat Jun 6 17:59:56 2015 UTC,"I think the music can do a lot more than give emotion. There are many functions music can have. There's an example in a book I've forgotten the name of. It goes like this: You have shot where a lady is walking down the stairs. If you play sad music, something probably just happened. If you play music with a lot of tension, something is about to happen. Or the music can set a time or place pretty much immediately. Ragtime honky-tonk piano? It's set around 1900 in the west. 60's psychedelic music? Well, you get the picture. So music can be a story-telling tool.  Personally I think it's a good thing if the movie can with without music. If you then add music, you're not fixing things, but instead you're adding an extra dimension. Which is what the music does for me, in for example 2001. And music is music, whether it's composed for the movie or existing music. Someone had to compose it at some point and the quality of the music itself will still be important."
TrueFilm,38q0u4,eliphas_levi,2,Sun Jun 7 09:17:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, the examples you give all fall under what I meant by ""building atmosphere"". (I see that the expression may not have been clear)   The quality of the music matters, yes - but my point was that Morricone, at least judging by the quote, seems to disregard the role of the sound editor as being less important. It's like he's putting the composer above everyone else, and it's understandable given that he is a composer... but then there's bogus claims like    criticizing “amateur” composers who try to cut costs by using synthesizers instead of actual instruments. “Electronic instruments flatten everything. Maybe you can do everything with [them], but the result is quite similar–a kind of standardized music,” he says.   This is just complete bullshit. Badly composed music won't work regardless of how it's recorded. The opposite is true as well. Good music is good music regardless of which tools are used to create it.  I think my main gripe is Morricone putting the role of the composer on the pedestal. I'll readily criticise any similar claim from any other single film crew member. Insert editing, cinematography, production design, etc into the following quote:   There are some directors who actually fear the possible success of ***. They fear that the audience or the critics will think the film has worked because there was very good ***   I mean this seems ridiculous to me. A single part of the filmmaking process done poorly can ruin the film, but if everything is done poorly except one part (let's say editing), the editing can't ""rescue"" the film and make it very good. No director would willingly sabotage their film by saying ""I don't want a score that's too good""."

It's interesting to me to see an audio narrative that is always at play so constantly and prominently.  Yet, many other films he scores leave something to be desired (most recently for me it was War Horse.) And that's for his score to shut up and let the movie do the story telling. Any movie requiring subtlety, ambiguity and emotional complexity should stay away from Williams."

Also Leit Motif isn't used as often anymore as well.  I think contemporary directors are just opting for a more minimalistic approach, something grittier and more subtle, letting sound design and the enviornment/ambience work more. Which I like.   There is certainly room for both. As much as I fell in love with many soundtracks before, and being mainly a music guy, I did some sound design in school and I feel its a shame that music has gotten away for opportunities to make movies feel so immersive with just sounds. I've grown an appreciation for sound artists.   Even movies with very prominent scores, they are still minimal. I don't know if its to save cost, or not, but it certainly seems to fit the style of films that are being made now."
TrueFilm,38q0u4,TheRingshifter,5,Sun Jun 7 06:27:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I can think of many recent films with many memorable scores. And also, it's not as if there was ever a time where all soundtracks were amazing - in fact, in the '40s and '50s, there seems to be a lot of sort of crummy melodramatic and samey soundtracks floating around (at least in my limited experience).   I do think what can cause this perception is that there is a large trend that says music shouldn't dictate the emotions of a scene. I don't think this is good or bad... sometimes a soundtrack can feel manipulative, but usually, if I ""manipulative-sounding"" soundtrack is pared with an already affective scene, it works."

TrueFilm,38q0u4,Fatmanredemption,5,Sun Jun 7 14:40:18 2015 UTC,"It should be said that the death of the traditional score is not due entirely to recent trends favoring a more subtle style of filmmaking. Even movies that are the complete opposite of subtle, like Big Hero 6 (which does utilize an orchestral score) still do not follow the ""standard of composition"" as Ennio Morricone sees it.   Traditionally, a good musical score is thematic. It has melodies that are reused, reorchestrated, reimagined, and recontextualized in different parts of the film. Think of how the ""Concerning Hobbits"" melody is used throughout the LoTR movies; the happy context in which it first appears, and the yearning nostalgic context in which it is used later on. These melodies become representative of characters, or they sometimes become characters themselves. In something like Big Hero 6, the score has the superficial appearance of a traditionally romantic/dramatic orchestral score, but that's it. The music becomes background, melody no longer matters. All that matters is that you use the right instruments, utilize the proper harmonic structures and modes to signify emotion, and bring the dynamics up or down where it's appropriate. So the music still executes all the proper functions that a score is meant to execute, but has none of the artistry. It's like an aesthetically beautiful well-made chair vs a perfectly functional chair. Most of the people who commission the composer really just care about whether or not you can sit in that chair. If it accomplishes that: Fine, we're good.  As a composer, you just have to be lucky enough to be commissioned by a director/team of producers that care as much about music as you do. And I'm not arguing that all scores need to be thematic. There are unique ways in which one can flex their musical muscles without feeling like a hack, yet also not be melodic or thematic either. People often point to the Social Network soundtrack as a good example of this. It's minimalist, electronic, innovative, but not melodic or thematic. But hey, this is pretty much the climate we live in now. You're lucky to make an artistically satisfying score that isn't merely functional in whatever way you can. But still, all it needs to do is function. You get paid either way."
TrueFilm,38q0u4,afewthoughtsonfilm,15,Sat Jun 6 17:05:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not by any means musically inclined, so I can't speak to the integrity of the scores being used these days.  However, as some who listens to scores from films quite frequently while writing, I disagree in part.  While blockbuster scores are certainly on the decline, there still are many great scores available.  For example, the works of Mihaly Vig in Damnation and Werckmeister Harmonies are incredibly good.  Just this last year, the score by Mica Levi for Under the Skin was sensational and, in my opinion, was one of the biggest snubs of last year's Oscar season.  Point being, there most definitely are great scores around, they just may not be in the most popular movies.  However, it feels wrong to me to outright decry them as no more."
TrueFilm,38q0u4,Topper_Harley,10,Fri Jun 5 22:13:02 2015 UTC,"Why does the standard of composition have to include an orchestra?  I don't remember any sort of rule saying film has to only have music from live orchestras.  Why is a live orchestra inherently better?   I think it's analogous to comparing plopping a record down on a turntable and pushing play vs. mix master mike or a-trak creating something completely unique and original.    I think a live orchestra is ""better"" the same way film is ""better"" than digital.  I am assigning value to it's quality and esthetic, but surely great stories can be told on a digital format or have completely artificial music created on a computer."

TrueFilm,38q0u4,5150RED,11,Sat Jun 6 15:32:50 2015 UTC,"For me, the question is: has there been a standard of composition for film? I don't feel that there has really been a standard of composition.  As sound was introduced to the film medium, music was used to develop a sense of atmosphere, influencing the perceived mood and tone.  At this basic level, that was/is the function of music.    Whether it is the music in the Carnival of Souls or for the Avengers, the music typically is used to play with the audience's emotions, accentuating what they are seeing on the screen.    What made Morricone, Zimmer, and Williams, among a few others, so phenomenal was that they used programmatic music (a style which  attempts to musically render an extra-musical narrative, and had existed well before the motion picture), and applied musical thematic development to characters and the plot.  Morricone's ostinato form and development of The Ecstasy of Gold theme draws upon motifs heard early in the film, creating an epic sense of a climax.  Williams, through all of the Star Wars films, does an excellent job at creating character and location themes, and developing them as the characters experience growth.  Zimmer does this as well (and I really enjoyed his use of ostinato forms combined with minimalism for the Dark Knight films).  The thing is, composers like these are few and far between not only because of the level of experience they have, but also because their most notable works came to be known because their respective directors understood the art of storytelling to the extent that they highly valued the impact music would have.  Much like the composers themselves, directors who appreciate just how much music can add to the experience are few and far between, and therein lies the issue.    Morricone is right about how money and a director's value of music can influence the prominence of a good score, but the fact that such directors and composers are fairly uncommon (even more so in the realm of popular media) leads me to conclude that the 'standard of composition' that Morricone defines does not actually exist.  It is this set of standards that made Morricone so influential and spectacular, but he made those standards for himself - not for the industry."
TrueFilm,38q0u4,NorrisOBE,8,Fri Jun 5 23:54:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with Ennio and I think the biggest culprit could be the rise of television.  There are more TV shows with memorable music than they are movies, especially blockbuster movies. I can describe the music of many TV shows these days, and yet I couldn't even remember a single movie soundtrack with the exception of Mad Max Fury Road.  The guiltiest party in this is definitely Marvel. The most memorable music in a Marvel property is a Daredevil Netflix series, especially with its decent theme song that still sticks to my head. I can't even remember how the soundtrack to Age of Ultron even sounds like. There's a few violin ensembles during battle scenes, and that's it I guess. The only composer in Marvel movies who seems to try is Tyler Bates.  Mad Max Fury Road proves that soundtracks could still play a huge role in making a film look amazing. If you want to hear a good film composition, then listen to the Fury Road soundtrack. It sounds amazing."

I did have to remind myself, though, that having an earworm of a soundtrack doesn't necessarily lend itself to compelling storytelling. Daredevil immediately came to mind when I tried to recall memorable TV soundtracks, but House of Cards is probably a better choice in my opinion. Perhaps Homeland? Both are understated until they really hit home; while House of Cards' emphasizes the steady forward pace of movement, Homeland's harkens back to spy films of yesterday, and lends a tangible sense of insecurity.  I also agree 100% on Fury Road's soundtrack; it was leaps ahead of anything I've heard Hans Zimmer compose, as often as he does get name-dropped in these types of threads.

The greats, slowly deteriorating themselves, are not being replaced by anyone better – and in fact are being replaced with mediocre composers. There are a few exceptions, but for the most part, films today do not put much focus on music. It's a crying shame, because a great musical score can literally change the meaning of a film and even work in symbiosis with it as well."
TrueFilm,38q0u4,Elcucumber,2,Sat Jun 6 09:21:59 2015 UTC,"From Antonioni:   I think music has had and can continue to have a great function in films, because there is no art form which the film medium cannot draw upon. In the case of music, it draws directly, and therefore the relationship is even closer. It seems to me, however, that this relationship is beginning to change. In fact, the way music is being used today is quite different than it was used ten years ago. At that time music was used to create a certain atmosphere in order to help get the image across to the spectator. Earlier, of course, in the period of the silent film, there was the old pianola which was originally used to hide the noise of the projecting machine and then, later, as a means to emphasize the images that passed over the screen in absolute silence. Since then, the use of music in films has changed a great deal, but in certain films today it is still being used that way, that is, as a kind of external commentary. Its function is to establish a rapport between the music and the spectator, not between the music and the film which is its proper function.   Even to this day, especially in certain films from Hollywood, a battle scene is accompanied with violent symphonic crescendos from a full orchestra; a sad scene is always accompanied with violin music because it is felt that violins create an atmosphere of sadness. But this seems to me to be a completely wrong way to use music, and has nothing whatever to do with cinematography.  There are, of course, certain films where music is used in a more meaningful way, as a means to complement the images, to heighten and intensify the meaning of the image. And this has been done with certain scenes in L'avventura and in [Alain] Resnais's Hiroshima, mon amour. And I must say that the music really worked well in these cases, that is, it expressed what the images themselves intended to express, it was used as an integral part of the image. Having said this, however, I must also say that I am personally very reluctant to use music in my films, for the simple reason that I prefer to work in a dry manner, to say things with the least means possible. And music is an additional means. I have too much faith in the efficacy, the value, the force, the suggestiveness of the image to believe that the image cannot do without music. It is true, however, that I have a need to draw upon sound, which serves an essential ""musical"" function. I would therefore say that true film ""music"" has not yet been invented. Perhaps it might be in the future. Until that time comes, however, I feel that music should be spliced out of the film and spliced into a disc, where it has an autonomy of its own."

The thematic development, and particularly how the theme moves between various keyboard family instruments really brings out the different moods of the film, developing the theme with timbre.    The magnitude of Zimmer's crescendos also evokes the enormity of space, the rumble of the spacecraft (which does not only have to be conveyed by sound effects), and increases the tension of the film.  He could have chosen harsh dissonance, or ascending melodies as predominant ways of increasing tension, but this would detract from the prevailing sense of exploration that Zimmer needed to convey as well.    His use ostinato form was great, particularly because of its frequent employment of a uniform tempo, emphasized with the melodies' rhythms and accents, which really resonated with the film's time motif.   If you were not referring to Interstellar, my apologies."

It's almost like the film and the soundtrack should be separated from each other so you can appreciate them fully without them trying to constantly out-do each other.   It's almost like there are periods where the brain is bored and there are silence... and then there are periods in the story where there is massive excitement and the mind is fully active and engaged.  In such periods, life can be overwhelming, like a wedding day - that can take months or years to process.   should be separated from each other so you can appreciate them fully    Again, this is an audience demanding that the film convey all it's meaning in one viewing.  The repeat of poetry in the film is alerting you to subtext.  Like any Mythology story, the subtext isn't going to come through for most people without multiple viewings and multiple years.  There is plenty of subtext to this film - despite many who don't like the film and prefer some other art.  That's fine, people have always fought over their Mythology stories and relevant creators.  For people who do enjoy the film, the details can be appreciated in multiple viewings.  Dismissing it as ""error"" and ""bad mixing"" is easier. And of course, some people like one film and not others for such details.  But I suggest the artist here is fully aware of what they are doing and it's all intentional and deliberate."
TrueFilm,38ob2v,bringthecoke,15,Fri Jun 5 14:44:17 2015 UTC,I'll make the case for Woman on the Run (1950) since very few people have seen it and it's playing tonight. This is a previously lost film that was recently restored by the Film Noir Foundation. A man witnesses a murder and goes on the run. The film follows his wife as she along with a reporter tries to find him before the police do. The film explores the couple's failing relationship in an interesting way as they visit significant places from their past. Beautiful photography of 1940's San Francisco and a nightmarish finale set in an amusement park really made this film stand out to me.   I wish they'd make TCM available to stream for people without a cable subscription. They're showing a lot of great stuff in this series that I'd like to catch.
TrueFilm,38ob2v,tonequality,5,Fri Jun 5 16:06:46 2015 UTC,"Dvr set, hope it's good!"

TrueFilm,38ob2v,tonequality,2,Fri Jun 5 23:52:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion.  I really enjoyed it.  The photography was great.  Do you know if it is unusual to have a female lead?  The marriage aspect added something interesting and different.  For anyone trying to watch on demand, oddly this movie wasn't available on the TCM app, although it seemed like all the other Friday noir movies were there.  I was able to access it from my cable company's on demand menu."
TrueFilm,38ob2v,pursehook,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:56:07 2015 UTC,"Glad you enjoyed it! I'm by no means an expert, but it's not completely unheard of to have a female lead in noir films. They were much less common, of course, but noir movies tended to be pretty good for female roles for the time. There's the femme fatales, of course, but then there are also movies like this one. Phantom Lady is another one that comes to mind that has a woman basically being a badass vigilante investigator (although the last shot kind of kills it).   Also I saw that this movie is actually available on archive.org for free if anyone else is looking for it, albeit in pretty poor quality. Hopefully, now that it's been restored it will get a nice DVD release."
TrueFilm,38ob2v,tonequality,5,Sun Jun 7 04:06:29 2015 UTC,Side note: Canvas and TCM are offering a free online course with certification at the end for Film Noir. Worth checking out: https://www.canvas.net/browse/bsu/tcm/courses/film-noir

TrueFilm,38ob2v,tonequality,3,Fri Jun 5 22:03:49 2015 UTC,"Not many people have seen Raw Deal (showing on July 10), but it's a great and suitably gritty Noir directed by Anthony Mann, and shows what wonders can be accomplished even on a small budget. Great script, great cinematography, and look for Raymond Burr as the heavy who likes to play with matches. Highly recommended."

TrueFilm,38ob2v,Sister_Treefro,0,Fri Jun 5 23:35:01 2015 UTC,I didn't realize it was TCM that was running that. It was in the pretrailer ads when I saw Avengers 2.
TrueFilm,38ob2v,ryl00,2,Fri Jun 5 22:11:26 2015 UTC,This is the first movie I looked for on the list. I've been wanting to watch it again but it's not there :(
TrueFilm,38ob2v,TheGreatZiegfeld,2,Fri Jun 5 22:06:07 2015 UTC,"It's probably just a rights issue.  TCM has easiest/cheapest access to WB stuff (?), while Double Indemnity is Paramount/Universal.  Plus I'm sure Double Indemnity still sells well standalone."
TrueFilm,38pcmh,GomezTheDragon,2,Fri Jun 5 18:43:38 2015 UTC,"Looking at the Wiki page for Robot Carnival, there are links to two other anthology films, Neo Tokyo (1987) and Short Peace (2013).  I also know of Batman: Gotham Knight (2008), which is quite specifically tied to another non-anime franchise, but it does exist.  I don't know if I feel the same way; I plan to watch each film you've suggested, and that I also just found. Anthology films in general tend to rub me the wrong way, but Beyond from the Animatrix is my favourite short film of all time, and if I hadn't watched the ABCs of Death, I wouldn't have discovered the films of Bruno Forzani and Helene Cattet, so I'll definitely be on the watch for standouts."
TrueFilm,38pcmh,CinematicPersona,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:11:00 2015 UTC,"I forgot about Neo Tokyo! How could I forget. I Love Neo Tokyo actually, I'd put it above a few others on the list. I'll edit the post.  I have not seen short peace, and am hesitant because it's part of a larger project, it seems a lottle more commercial than the others. But I'll probably check it out now that I know about it."

TrueFilm,38pcmh,tosleepsoastodream,2,Fri Jun 5 20:19:35 2015 UTC,"I love anime anthologies. They are fairly rare but their short form is perfect for anime, almost like a sampler dish of different anime styles in one helping. Here are a few  other anthologies that haven't been mentioned so far:  Short Piece (2013) - most recent anthology movie I know of - 3 stories: one from the past, another from the mythic, the last one in the future.  The Cockpit (1993) - this is really an ww II ova series of 3 episodes by Leiji Matsumoto (Yamato, captain harlock).  I really like the story of the ohka kamikaze pilot.  Twilight Q (1987) - this is actually 2 episodes and can be considered Japanese twilight zone.   Non-anime anthology movie:  Kwaidan (1964) - had to put one live action film in here because I just generally love anthologies - this is a movie about old school Japanese ghost stories - very well done."
TrueFilm,38pcmh,nerga,2,Fri Jun 5 22:17:09 2015 UTC,Those are awesome suggestions. I'm definitely going to watch Twilight Q tonight
TrueFilm,38o144,sdsachs,10,Fri Jun 5 13:33:48 2015 UTC,"Also, it's the first film to be shot in the wider aspect ratio, which I think makes it feel much more ""cinematic"" to modern eyes. I don't know whether this necessitated a different film stock and process, which inherently involved different lighting and more ""film-like"" result. And the sound is better stereo too.  It's interesting to ponder whether what looks good now, maybe didn't look great then. Darker, contrasty scenes might have seemed ""murky"" to contemporary audiences, while looking ""atmospheric"" to us.  Of course, the bright yellow ski-suit helps compensate. :-)  Joking aside, I really wish they'd sorted that soundtrack. The wah-wah guitar plus synth is quite poor - although they bass-synth sounds they use are quite rumbling and could have formed part of a better soundtrack. It's the ""sound effects"", little accents, they put everywhere that are most awful.  EDIT: I've just put this on, and something that sticks out is how crap the helvetica-type font they use in the credits looks. Did they use that for every pre-Craig Bond film? I know Goldeneye (you're not there yet) has a cheesy font for the actual film title, but apart from that...  EDIT2: Found the answer."
TrueFilm,38o144,TriumphantGeorge,4,Fri Jun 5 17:35:56 2015 UTC,"Excellent catch on the aspect ratio.  I often wonder what aspects of what we watch now will date the quickest.  You're right.  Will our polished films will look obviously ""2010s"" in a few decades.  That said, there were films from every era that excelled in areas like cinematography.  I mean look at the 1970s.  How many iconic images came from that period.  The 007 films were basically popcorn pictures.  How serious were they being taken?  Skyfall boasted perhaps one of the most prolific DPs of today.  I wonder if the 007 films of today will date as quickly as these old ones OR will we look back at them and still feel that they hold up long into the future.    And I feel silly for having forgotten to mention the SFX.  It's like when they used the slide whistle in TMWTGG during the car jump.  Why dumb it down like that?  How much humor does that really add?  I read a quote from John Barry regarding some of these audio choices and how even at the time, they regretted having to put them in.    Amusing note on the titles.  I hadn't even caught that after all these films.  Oddly consistent (sans a few minor variations) pretty much up until Goldeneye."
TrueFilm,38o144,TriumphantGeorge,7,Fri Jun 5 19:57:52 2015 UTC,"how serious   It's a good point. They were churning these things out. Some television series had better cinematography and direction [than Bond at the time].  They were always happy to use whatever was current in terms of culture and technology, both in the film and for the making of the film. That's part of what made them quite exciting at the time, but also dates them and results in some poor choices, because things weren't bedded in.  For the 2010s in general, I think it'll be the colour grading plus new camera moves allowed by tech that will date things - due to overuse. The 1970's has its zooms, the 1980's were overlit studios, the 1990's the fledgling CGI and increased stylisation. That's ours.  Bond will date the same as always. Those things, plus fashions of the day. Casino Royale had parkour, Quantum was very contemporary in its editing, maybe got a head start on action film screenplay incoherence; Skyfall is hard to suss because it's more an anniversary film than anything, and it might suffer for that in retrospect.   sans a few minor variations   But - ahem - always sans serif! Oh dear."
TrueFilm,38o144,JackShitAboutFuckAll,3,Fri Jun 5 21:28:36 2015 UTC,"Huh, you're a film buff. Plus you like...   Bond, James Bond. .   In addition it would seem that you have a much greater grasp of cinematography than I.  Bond was my hero as a kid.  Still get a good kick out of the books and films."
TrueFilm,38o144,TriumphantGeorge,6,Fri Jun 5 22:06:26 2015 UTC,"Huh, you're a film buff.   Ha, well I watch a thing or two occasionally, it's true.   Bond was my hero as a kid. Still get a good kick out of the books and films.   It's very good at what it is! I've never read the books but I've always enjoyed the films. There's obviously something interesting going on when, in the poorer showings, a film can be enjoyed even for not being enjoyable!   And now that Craig-Bond has taken its stand on gritty-but-witty territory, we  find things like Kingsman appearing to resurrect the best of the Moore-era's sense of gleeful fun (while avoiding spoof or camp).  Bond is a concept that's so good, it can survive pretty much anything and still have something happening."
TrueFilm,38o144,craig_c,8,Sat Jun 6 07:37:03 2015 UTC,"This is definitely one of the better Bonds, which is a surprise given what came before it, it suddenly feels more 'epic'. Also I love the theme song, though the incidental music in the film is cheese. If you're going to watch the Bonds in order, beware you're in for declining returns again, much like the movies after Dr No, FRWL etc. But that's all part of the fun!"
TrueFilm,38o144,Sparkdog,6,Fri Jun 5 19:17:33 2015 UTC,"I'm also in the process of watching every Bond movie, just finished out the Moore era last night.  The bad stands out so much more than the good when it comes to the Moore films.  Every Bond film is a bit fascinating when viewed as a product of its time, but some Moore-era films are particularly bad in their blatant attempts to match the plot to whatever genre was ""cool"" at the time.  Live and Let Die (1973) often plays like a straight Blaxploitation flick more than a British secret agent thriller.  The Man with the Golden Gun ('74) has shoehorned-in martial arts sequences.  And Moonraker ('79) was clearly capitalizing on the post-Star Wars sci-fi craze, especially since the previous film, The Spy Who Loved Me, promised us that James Bond would return in ""For Your Eyes Only"", which was pushed back until after.  It also feels like Octopussy ('83) took quite a few cues from Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I'm in agreement on TSWLM being the best Moore entry.  I loved the apparent callbacks to From Russia With Love, which is my vote for the highest-quality Connery flick.  For Your Eyes Only also has many redeeming elements, and Octopussy is entertaining, though ultimately fluff.  A View to a Kill is pretty terrible - what amounts to a race-horse breeding sub-plot eats up literally the entire first half of the film, a young Chris Walken is criminally under-used, and most of the rest is pretty fluffy.  I'm taking a break for now.  Next up I'm going back and watching the original Casino Royale and also Never Say Never Again, to be a completionist.  Quite excited to watch the Dalton years (never seen Living Daylights before) and Goldeneye, and dreading the inevitable trudge through every Brosnan film after that."
TrueFilm,38o144,craig_c,3,Fri Jun 5 20:17:01 2015 UTC,"I recommend that you get a solid grip on the edge of your chair for the original Casino Royale, I love 60s cheese, but this baby is a mess like non-other."
TrueFilm,38o144,Alexanderzx360,3,Fri Jun 5 23:40:46 2015 UTC,"I've been following around your reviews since I started my own Bond marathon (started last week, already done with Roger Moore era) and I've agreed with you mostly all of the time. This time the only thing that I really disagree with you is the score, I love the theme song (one of my favorite Bond themes), I think it fits perfectly between the ""romance"" between Bond and Amasova. For the rest of the score I didn't find it ""extraordinary"", but I didn't thought of it as bad as you described it. Anyway I can't wait for you to post your next review, keep up the good work!"
TrueFilm,38o144,OhSoWittyUsername,2,Sun Jun 7 20:59:38 2015 UTC,"This one is the first major increase in Bond budgets in a long time.  Adjusted for inflation, it's the biggest budget since You Only Live Twice.  After the disappointment of The Man with the Golden Gun, I guess they decided to go back to Big Bond.  Man, did it work.  Adjusted for inflation, this one is one of the biggest hits in the series.  This ""bigger budget means bigger box office"" idea goes a good way to explaining why the next movie is the budget-busting Moonraker.  I like this one, but it's not a favorite.  Moore is at his best and a lot works well, but it feels too much like a pastiche of earlier Bond movies.  The villain’s plot and the climax are from You Only Live Twice, though moved from outer space to the ocean.  Jaws is an attempt to bring back both Red Grant and Oddjob.  There’s yet another fistfight in a train compartment.    All three Lewis Gilbert-directed Bonds end the same way: a huge shootout between an army of Good Guys and an army of Bad Guys in a giant Ken Adam set as Bond chases after the Big Bad.  There's the Volcano in YOLT, the giant ship in TSWLM, and the space station in Moonraker.  These endings drag down my own enjoyment of the movies, because those mass movie shootouts are my least favorite style of climax.    Random crazy crap: the famous “007 Stage,” the biggest permanent stage in the world for a very long time, was built for the climax to this movie.  Many, many later big-budget movies used that stage."
TrueFilm,38mpk5,MrJumbo,14,Fri Jun 5 05:21:02 2015 UTC,"My experience with the Before trilogy was actually a bit odd. I watched Before Sunset on a plane ride, not having seen Before Sunrise. I was absolutely entranced by it, which was no doubt helped by the fact I was stuck on a tiny seat on a crowded plane. After having watched all three movies, Before Sunset still remains my favorite, and I found Before Sunrise naively optimistic while watching it (but entertaining nonetheless). I don't know if anyone else has had the same experience, but I kind of enjoyed the fact that I watched the middle movie first. It was fun trying to piece together what had happened previously, who was lying and who wasn't (I remember Celine denying some parts while Jesse claiming it happened), and just watching the exchange between the two without having any knowledge of their history beyond the biased accounts that I could glean from the dialogue. Absolutely captivating experience."
TrueFilm,38mpk5,SeasonsWithSpice,8,Fri Jun 5 07:28:08 2015 UTC,The ending to Before Sunset remains one of my favorite ending scenes in any movie I've seen.
TrueFilm,38mpk5,eojen,2,Sat Jun 6 20:57:40 2015 UTC,"Haha, for me, my first film was Before Midnight and I watched it on a plane ride as well. So the couple that I saw was a flawed one, and I witnessed a very real portrayal of jaded marriage life, one that is past the honeymoon stage. At that time I didn't know that there was a whole series of Before films so when I finally watched Before Sunset, it was just so amazing seeing how it all began. There are a lot of films portraying couples over the course of their lifetime but they are always condensed into one film and never as fleshed out as Linklater's Before series. I don't actually have a favourite because it's the same couple throughout but all the movies have different tones. Like you mentioned, Before Sunset being naively optimistic, Before Sunrise portraying the characters at some sort of crossroads in their lives (especially Hawke's character), and Before Midnight showing the harsh and humorous reality of long-term commitment. The audience matures along with the characters. Best series ever made!"
TrueFilm,38mpk5,hologram96,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:52:22 2015 UTC,I think that's what I love about the first actually. Two young naive lovers are going to be optimistic because they don't have the experience they have in the later films.  I mean that's basically what Before Midnight was about. What if they were too optimistic?
TrueFilm,38mpk5,spyfer,11,Tue Jun 9 00:06:20 2015 UTC,"I remember watching Before Sunrise and being absolutely blown away at this small indie movie from the 90s. Then I heard there was a sequel and it was absolutely perfect. Then years later, after I'd forgotten about the two, I heard they were making it into a trilogy. I rewatched both before Before Midnight and was again blown away. They just age so well and seem like entirely different movies, depending where you are in life when you watch them.  For someone who hasn't seen any of them, would you tell them its a trilogy? How would you convince them to watch just one?"
TrueFilm,38mpk5,throwawayaccountforw,28,Fri Jun 5 07:33:13 2015 UTC,"Over the past few years of being an ardent fan of cinema, I've come to realize that Linklater's films cannot be discussed, the same way reality cannot be interpreted. What you see is what forms the only layer. The charm is in the conversations and in the realistic atmosphere, not in any underlying meaning that calls for interpretation. His films are like his characters. You're walking down a street in Venice having a conversation with a pretty girl. It's all about the moment. If the moment touches you or strikes a chord, you fall in love. If not, you move on. But yes, his films have a sort of magic that only an honest lack of drama can conjure."

TrueFilm,38mpk5,JedLeland,6,Fri Jun 5 12:41:17 2015 UTC,"Anyone that is even remotely interested in Linklater should watch Slacker obviously but more importantly watch Slacker with the commentary - it gives great insight into his general filmmaking process, why his films are so dialogic and also why they work so well.  AFAIK it's also on YouTube."
TrueFilm,38mpk5,mrwazsx,5,Fri Jun 5 15:27:58 2015 UTC,"The first time I saw Before Sunrise was last year and I did not like it at all, the characters and their dialogues made me cringe, but anyhow I went on to watch the other two as well, and I realized by the end that this is real people are. This is how I talk to people or other people communicate, except that in the movie settings as an audience it seems odd. It almost feels like he overheard and recorded conversations like these or used them from his own experience. I really enjoyed Boyhood then, knowing what he was doing. Liked it more than Blue jasmine even though i am a sucker for Woody Allen because Boyhood seemed like what he was already good at but done at a grander scale."
TrueFilm,38mpk5,saarth,2,Fri Jun 5 10:43:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with your sentiment regarding the dialogue. I've heard people complain that Boyhood had dialogue that felt clunky and awkward, even though that's the point. Linklater set out to achieve a film that felt like real life, and in my opinion captured the way we talk very well. Ever day I hear something and think that it sounds cringeworthy, or say something and soon after realise that I came across quite awkward and nonsensical.   EDIT: Typos."
TrueFilm,38mpk5,isarge123,2,Sun Jun 7 14:18:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly! It wasn't until later I realized this is how we actually talk and would seem so annoying to a third person."
TrueFilm,38mpk5,saarth,3,Tue Jun 9 10:15:07 2015 UTC,"I love these films (and all of linklaters work really) so much I find it hard to talk about them on an intellectual and non emotional level. I saw before sunrise when I was young and remember the day that I heard that there was a sequel in the works. Part of me was disappointed (and maybe some of me still is) because the first was so beautiful and pure and maybe a bit naive? I love the second two a lot now, but something is really beautiful and simplistic about two complete strangers wandering around all night. Sort of like a dream."
TrueFilm,38mpk5,somuchfeels,5,Fri Jun 5 13:34:00 2015 UTC,"I've said since Midnight's release that this was the most perfect film trilogy I'd ever seen. Each film is perfectly written, directed, and even moreso acted. The character development, arcs, real life conversations and realizations...it's just stunning. I think being an actor also helps me to appreciate every scene and interaction. This is an actor's dream material. I would perform any snippet of these films whenever and wherever you wanted me to."
TrueFilm,38mpk5,Trystonian,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:12:52 2015 UTC,Say more! What is it about these movies that make them such good acting material?
TrueFilm,38mpk5,Flubby2,3,Fri Jun 12 10:48:23 2015 UTC,"For starters the individuals and their dialogue are incredibly rooted. These aren't characters acting out lines, they are real people speaking honestly. There's a major difference between seeing an actor act and seeing a character exist, and the material and direction here allows for the latter.  The story allows for a beautiful chemistry and relationship, and any actor can tell you that the relationship between two characters is one of the most important aspects of a production. It determins how characters react, affects their tactics as they work towards their objectives, and can be a defining factor on an audience's involvement and investment in a production.   This couple has an unflinching chemistry. They are electric balls of fire dancing around philosophical observations and deeply rooted thoughts and feelings pouring straight from their inner conscience. And through these interactions we find how different and how similar they are. How much they work and don't work together. How much they're perfect and utterly fucked up beings. Their strengths and flaws.   This is the most honest and wonderful couple put to film in my opinion. Such rich and deeply illustrated characters are a dream for an actor. There's so much to work off of and from.  I don't know if I'm even making a coherent point or just drooling all over these films but there are some more of my thoughts."
TrueFilm,38mpk5,Trystonian,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:16:51 2015 UTC,"Nah, it makes a lot of sense! Thanks for the answer."
TrueFilm,38mpk5,Flubby2,4,Fri Jun 12 15:48:23 2015 UTC,"I only saw Sunrise and Sunset in preparation for seeing Midnight when it came out.  I'm roughly the same age as Hawke and Delpy, so I really feel like I missed the boat with this series, since I could have seen how much I related to each film as a member of each age group had I only seen them when they came out."
TrueFilm,38mpk5,JedLeland,3,Fri Jun 5 17:16:36 2015 UTC,"Lovely description - I think you're right about the trust in the actors too. Where film has it's strengths is where is can mimick the ham experience, like memory, dream sequence or the elevation of the mundane. The before trilogy is beautiful to me, I can see how it might get on some people's nerves but it's just lovely and poetic in it's simplicity of story but nuances of pace and performance bring you this very raw and emotional reaction in how real it feels. A Fantastic rom com that's somehow more gritty than any superhero reboot through sheet emotional impact and porous detail."
TrueFilm,38mpk5,leglesssheep,3,Fri Jun 5 13:28:18 2015 UTC,"I've watched them from the start and, luckily for me, been the same age as the characters. Each movie was perfect for me, but when watching them again years later, they lose something. It makes sense, but I figured I'd share my experience of growing up with the characters."
TrueFilm,38mpk5,ausmatt73,3,Fri Jun 5 15:38:24 2015 UTC,"I remember the first time I saw this trilogy was with my now-ex girlfriend, in which it ended up pushing us into a relationship that neither of us were ready for.  Such is the power of the Before Trilogy: it shows us how beautiful relationships can be without feeling an ounce phony (which seems to be a mistake that most romance movies in general are perpetrating). I mean, in an essence, the films are about two people, both from separate walks of life,  as they ruminate on existence, and despite the films only spanning a single day (or in the case of Sunset, hours), by the end of each movie we feel like we know more about each character than they divulge.  With each movie, you witness these characters change. They start out as idealistic young adults and by the end, they're weary and experienced with life. And as you witness them change, you can't help but feel yourself changed, maybe in the slight, but still enough to be noticed.   It's quite beautiful, and quite the impressive feat."
TrueFilm,38mpk5,Ooitastic,2,Fri Jun 5 17:36:42 2015 UTC,"Its such a wonderful trilogy. For the last few months of my last relationship, I was trying desperately to get my now ex-girlfriend to watch these films. I wanted to know what she thought of them. Suffice to say she never watched them and we are no longer together. I don't know if there was any connection to her lack of interest in the films and our break up but these three films are extremely important to me and I would have really like if the woman I loved appreciated them as much as I do."

TrueFilm,38lxo8,RoyallyTenenbaumed,11,Fri Jun 5 02:02:10 2015 UTC,"Good call... I didn't make that specific connection but the cinematography is definitely iconic in its own right. Some of the claustrophobic and cluttered interiors with a ton of characters crammed into a narrow shot seem reminiscent of parts of Blade Runner in addition to the color scheme you point out.   2046 will definitely give you more of those Blade Runner vibes, maybe even more so than Chungking Express. Days of Being Wild is my only other point of comparison. It's a different kind of movie... Slower, less polished, more oriented around dramas between individual characters. It's a great experience too though."
TrueFilm,38lxo8,incredulitor,2,Fri Jun 5 03:40:30 2015 UTC,"Definitely, the interiors with all the people and the neon lighting is what struck me as being Blade Runnerish. I'm really looking forward to watching 2046! I also plan on watching Days and Fallen Angels.   I wish there were more directors like this. Nicholas Winding Refn at least, but he's a bit different."
TrueFilm,38lxo8,Monteitoro,2,Fri Jun 5 05:14:48 2015 UTC,yea there is a definite Blade Runner vibe with the neon lights and blue green tint. The scenes that take place on the city streets at night in Blade Runner come to mind .
TrueFilm,38lxo8,wpb13,9,Fri Jun 5 17:27:52 2015 UTC,"Hey, I just saw this for the first time a day ago! Seen a lot of other Wong Kar Wai - to echo others I recommend Fallen Angels.  I personally think it may be more an instance of Blade Runner owing a lot of its visuals to Hong Kong and generally a lot of busy Asian metropolises. And Express is just an amazingly precise portrayal of Hong Kong.   Great connection to make though, makes sense. Chris Doyle is such a genius."
TrueFilm,38lxo8,theoldentimes,4,Fri Jun 5 07:08:22 2015 UTC,"I think you've got a point there. I watched Chung King a few years ago, so it's not quite at the front of my mind. But living in Hong Kong, it can feel a lot like living in Blade Runner. The streets and the rain, for one; the slightly shabby appearance of many things, right next to lavish advertising, for another. So there may be direct influence between the movies but it's as likely to the choice of location itself."
TrueFilm,38lxo8,argentuned,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:30:31 2015 UTC,Awesome! I'll definitely check out his other movies. You're probably right about the connection being more about Hong Kong
TrueFilm,38lxo8,poliphilo,7,Thu Jun 11 02:20:37 2015 UTC,Chungking Express has the languid blue tones and has some scenes that take place during the day http://i3.minus.com/iyg5gaLFweFq5.jpg  but his next movie Fallen Angels has more grimy green sheens with bits of red and takes place (I think entirely) at night. http://i1.minus.com/iL4GKnsb7pked.jpg  Both movies give you different sides of Hong Kong.   Here's the /r/movies discussion of WKW http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2azj6n/theme_of_the_moment_wong_karwai/ there's some good recommendations and discussion in there.
TrueFilm,38lxo8,callmesingham,2,Fri Jun 5 04:55:26 2015 UTC,Oh wow those are definitely different but still maintain the aesthetic. I like the darker tone of Fallen Angels. I am looking forward to watching it.   Thanks for the link!!!
TrueFilm,38lxo8,Monteitoro,5,Fri Jun 5 05:37:48 2015 UTC,"I think Happy Together is WKW's masterpiece.  Like In the Mood For Love and Chungking Express, it's focused on romance, as well as Tony Leung's sad, longing eyes. HT maybe doesn't reach the visual excitement of Fallen Angels or 2046 or In the Mood..., but it is still spectacularly beautiful, and I find the visuals echo and play off of the emotions with an intense and sustained musicality I still find gripping. Even though the focus is a couple guys far from home, feeling lonely in the strange world of Buenos Aires, the Piazzola soundtrack & the Doyle visuals & WKW's editing make it seem like a magically perfect place to be lonely in.  Also, you might or might not have heard that Chungking Express was made by WKW as a mini-personal/fun project to clear his head as he was struggling to finish Ashes of Time, his early wuxia epic. Ashes has difficult pacing and is really confusing or boring at points, but some of the vignettes are successful and touching. And there are some thematic echoes with Chungking Express that are pretty fascinating. Chungking Express, of course, is the one that launched WKW as an international star and inspired 100s of other films. I find that whole story pretty interesting."
TrueFilm,38lxo8,Monteitoro,5,Fri Jun 5 07:53:22 2015 UTC,"Did you know that he also worked without a script while filming Chungking? He took the story progressively forward as he shot everyday. After finishing a day's shoot, he would sit to write the next day's scenes. Oh, and he finished the whole project in three months! That's heavy duty badass love for cinema. His films fucking reek of it."

TrueFilm,38lxo8,PeterKien,3,Thu Jun 11 02:22:43 2015 UTC,"I thought it was great, definitely not for the mainstream movie fan as I know alot of people that would hate it. It has been awhile but I did think the cinematography was awesome and the Mise en scene. I remember the shot where the actor is slowly disappearing up the escalator. The utilization of the song California Dreamin' was awesome and i'll always think of this film when I hear that song. It was also interesting how the film was split into two parts in a way."
TrueFilm,38lxo8,callmesingham,2,Fri Jun 5 03:36:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I doubt the mainstream fan would really like it haha. It's narrative isn't exactly in your face. Someone else mentioned that they didn't like how much California Dreamin' was in the movie, but I enjoyed it. I can definitely relate to the girl wanting to listen to loud music to drown out her thoughts haha.   The way it was split into two parts and how they segued was really cool. I definitely preferred the second half, but both were great."
TrueFilm,38lxo8,musthurryfastfast,6,Fri Jun 5 05:09:47 2015 UTC,"it looked great, lots of nice fluorescent night-time shots, but I had to hear mamas and the papas california dreaming like seventeen times during that movie like they just got that song over there last week"
TrueFilm,38lxo8,denimbastard,2,Fri Jun 5 04:33:11 2015 UTC,Haha..I figured someone wouldn't like how much they used that song. I didn't mind. It kind of reinforced the idea of California and dreams before she actually did it. I feel like it helped replace a lot of exposition that would have occurred to flesh out her character.
TrueFilm,38lxo8,kallol_chatterjee,2,Fri Jun 5 05:15:58 2015 UTC,"To me it went further than that. I had to mute the film whenever I could hear California Dreamin' starting during the last half of it, it was really, physically unpleasant to me how they would start and stop the song at random and never let it finish. Gorgeous cinematography, but I can never see this film again with the sound on I'm afraid. And I was really blown away by it visually, but have this crippling  auditive fear of it now. And I used to like that song. Now it has become the soundtrack to what my nightmares are made of - it took me almost a week to get the song from not playing on repeat in my head after I had watched Chungking Express. Felt like a prelude to insanity.  With that said, I really disliked the character played by Faye Wong, and found the actress to be too androgynous for my taste, but recognize that is not valid criticism. I also got increasingly annoyed by her erratic, nonsensical and criminal behaviour. But then again, I had the same feeling watching Amelié. Maybe those manic pixie dream girls just get the wrong kind of rise out of me. Perhaps you can shed some light on your newfound love for her?  I can see your point, to an extent, with regards to Blade Runner, but didn't think of that myself when watching Chungking Express, and didn't think of Chungking Express when I saw the most recent digitally enhanced version of Blade Runner in theaters a month ago. Besides neon lights and street signs with Cantonese print, what is really so similar between them? I would argue that if you disregard those two things, you will find the camera movement, pacing, and editing to be completely different. And that is without mentioning the soundtrack (you can probably guess I would listen to Vangelis any day over Mammas and the Papas if you've read this far), the acting, the plot and the atmosphere. A cop running in an urban environment lit by neon is not enough for me to find them similar, to be frank.  I have personally wanted to see In the Mood for Love for some time now, but have troubles with the subtitles currently. To me, it seems like a movie with the potential to hit high on my personal favourite list, and venture the guess that you might like it as well, since the cinematography is also by the eminent Christopher Doyle."
TrueFilm,38lxo8,callmesingham,2,Fri Jun 5 07:24:55 2015 UTC,Wow. You must be the only person in the whole of milky way to dislike Chungking Express. :)
TrueFilm,38mnmc,PrecisionEsports,9,Fri Jun 5 05:03:33 2015 UTC,"I think The Wind Rises is one of Miyazaki's most interesting works. At first I was disappointed in the subject matter, as I had hoped he would return to the folklore fantasy of Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle (which I think isn't as complete as the previous two, but still features incredible design and imagination). But I've since come around. Jiro is probably his most complex, flawed, and tragic protagonist. His inability to engage with the world around him and his drive to fulfill his childhood drive, tied to Miyazaki's own drive to create animation, leave him as an unwilling or inadvertent participant in Japan's own destruction. His love life and professional drive parallel each other.  This is a great overview by /u/Fatmanredemption that I highly recommend reading. /u/lordhadri's response also likens Jiro to the German scientists, such as Wernher von Braun, who designed weapons of war like the V2, only to send men to the moon a couple of decades later. It's a comparison I find particularly apt."
TrueFilm,38mnmc,Dark1000,2,Fri Jun 5 07:38:27 2015 UTC,"I saw this two days ago, and what really struck me was how conflicted this movie was. I'm Chinese, so the Zero fighter probably did more than its fair share in dealing death to Chinese folks. Koreans feel the same way. Yet, removed from that concept, Miyazaki's point about flight, aircraft, etc. is right. Humans should not know how to fly, but here we are, treating flight as if it were an everyday thing. We have no biological capability of doing so. That's fucking amazing. And yet, perhaps because it's so mundane, we can create machines that help us kill each other. The atomic bomb was similar, but it has that tension where its aura of sacredness balances the industrial mundanity.  The love story was a bit harder to grasp, I think. It seemed like it was shoehorned in, but really, it reflects the loss that the protagonist had to face. The Zero fighter was never going to be used for anything but death. Nahoko (or however her name is spelled) was inevitably going to die. But nonetheless, they went on."
TrueFilm,38mnmc,pieman3141,5,Wed Jun 17 04:55:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that! That was a nice read before bed :)   train scene   That might be my favorite scene in all of Miyazaki's work. Oh what I would give to see the 3 hour long Spirited Away.   ""Don't worry, you can make it all right.""   The way he manages to guide the audience during that film, to leave this message is always impressive. Such an understated but purely optimistic message."
TrueFilm,38ivze,Raxivace,38,Thu Jun 4 14:50:18 2015 UTC,"The cruelty seen in Electrocuting an Elephant is relatively unconnected to the film itself. The film was made of the event, and it could be argued that had no one agreed to do so the organizers may have called it off.  The execution event was put on by owners of Luna Park in NYC, after the elephant (who already had a reputation, perhaps undeservedly so) was involved in some further incidents. The park's owners, allegedly eager for publicity, decided to execute the elephant by hanging and make it a public spectacle. To answer your question about PETA, a far more effective organization stopped the hanging, and that organization still exists today: The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA).  After this, the owners scaled back invitations to the spectacle and changed it from a public hanging to a private poisoning and electrocution. Why the ASCPA also wasn't able to prevent this, I don't know, however it's claimed that the owners tried to outright give the elephant to the ASPCA instead of kill it. ASPCA agents were in attendance, and also inspected aspects of it to make sure it was part of an agreed-upon plan. Also in attendance were filmmakers who worked for Thomas Edison's company. Contrary to popular belief, however (if the Wikipedia article is accurate), the event took place ten years after the ""current wars,"" and was not a propaganda piece against AC over DC, and the event itself was certainly not organized by Edison.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topsy_(elephant)#Association_with_Thomas_Edison"
TrueFilm,38ivze,SuperConductiveRabbi,8,Thu Jun 4 16:08:50 2015 UTC,watched Swiss Family Robinson a couple months ago again. It would seem that their tiger vs dog scenes and the whole making a bunch of animals swim for their lives would be frowned against pretty hard now.
TrueFilm,38ivze,jedlucid,7,Thu Jun 4 23:13:01 2015 UTC,Obviously the countless westerns that lead to horses being injured and as a result likely killed come to mind.  Maybe the walrus hunt from Nanook of the North? My understanding was that that was one of the many staged sequences from that film and used methods that were already pretty outdated for the Inuit. But that movie's obviously got some weird exoticizing attitudes mixed in in healthy portions already to go along with the footage of the walrus hunt.
TrueFilm,38ivze,SomeOldGoat,3,Thu Jun 4 23:16:20 2015 UTC,"As far as horses go, I think Ben-Hur wins the medal for the most injuries/deaths. The chariot race was about as close to real as you can get. I don't think I've heard any official figure, but something like a hundred horses were killed during the filming of that sequence. You put that many horses in a confined space with chariots and things are going to get sketchy fast.  It certainly made for an amazing spectacle, and I think you would be hard-pressed to create a chariot race with the same level of realism these days, with more safety restrictions and the fact that extensive effects/CGI would be used."
TrueFilm,38ivze,vee_lan_cleef,4,Fri Jun 5 07:25:57 2015 UTC,"Land Without Bread (1933) came to mind, in which the filmmaker staged the deaths of a goat and a donkey (one by falling down a cliff and the other by bee stings). You can see it here. The first isn't graphic but the second has a somewhat disturbing shot."
TrueFilm,38ivze,kyle_albasi,3,Thu Jun 4 17:18:27 2015 UTC,"Most famous examples of animal cruelty I can think of: the cow slaughtering scene in Apocalypse Now and the slaughter of many animals in Cannibal Holocaust (including a monkey). There's even a Bergman film (Passion of Anna, if I'm not mistaken), where Sydow goes to save a dog that's hanging from a noose. In all honesty, I'm not sure if it's actually illegal to kill animals for films, or if it would be so damning to do so that people have done away with it altogether. I'd be interested to learn more about that."
TrueFilm,38ivze,r_hibbs,2,Fri Jun 5 02:00:36 2015 UTC,"In the Passion of Anna, animal cruelty is part of the story. The filmed results are somewhat disturbing but I felt Bergman handled the filming well enough to show animals in distress but never tortured and dying."

TrueFilm,38ivze,PoetKeats,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:08:15 2015 UTC,"A film that comes to mind is the animal slaughters in Cannibal Holocaust by Ruggero Deodato. Turtles getting chopped up, chain monkeys being killed by tigers, pigs being shot by shotguns at point blank. Crew members despised him, actors were vomiting off-screen, and all the while he defended his artistic integrity. While the animal killings really have nothing to do with the plot, it does bring up the conflict of civilized versus uncivilized societies and the imperialism of Western culture upon others and the disambiguition of what is deemed ""acceptable"" to the West and what is ""acceptable"" to the East."
TrueFilm,38ivze,DaTurbanator,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:09:11 2015 UTC,"I've always thought that the treatment of horses in old westerns was absolutely insane.  A little more contemporary than silent film, but there's a scene in The Wild Bunch where a bridge falls out under a bunch of men riding horses.  What a crazy thing to do to such a massive animal.  Another insane piece of animal brutality in film is the extremely explicit roo cull in Wake in Fright.  Its the peak of insanity in an already unsettling movie."
TrueFilm,38ivze,Indetermination,-32,Fri Jun 5 04:45:11 2015 UTC,"It's illogical to get upset about this kind of stuff when celluloid film contains gelatin (to my knowledge, vegetarian film doesn't exist). Think how many more animals died in the production of The Sound of Music than Electrocuting an Elephant. Despite Godard and Dreyer, ethically progressive individuals must question whether 20th century cinema was worth it.   Luckily all the great films of the past have been digitized, and the great filmmakers of today and tommorow have pretty much abandoned the medium in favor of better technology."
TrueFilm,38ivze,DearEloise,29,Thu Jun 4 16:09:56 2015 UTC,"Gelatin is made from by-products of the meat and leather industries. Therefore, it's unlikely that the death toll would have been noticeably lower in the absence of film."

TrueFilm,38ivze,DearEloise,3,Thu Jun 4 21:29:36 2015 UTC,"You're totally right, and I think you've made some really good points. Film is really a difficult issue, at least for me. I do not knowingly use/consume animal products other than occasionally shooting a roll of film. I realize that it supports industries I don't approve of (albeit in a minor way). And I can't really justify it. The closest I can get to a justification is that I'm pretty sure no animal has ever died for the sake of producing film; it is a side benefit for the animal industries, and if animal agriculture did not exist, I am sure film would be made with some alternative.  I realize that does not necessarily make it okay, but that's the one area where I kind of just shrug my shoulders. I realize you probably disagree. Regardless, I'm glad there are people as committed as you are."
TrueFilm,38ivze,Rice_Dream_Girl,2,Fri Jun 5 03:10:55 2015 UTC,"The animals aren't retroactively less-harmed by your use of their gelatin.   This is true, but they are most likely not more harmed by it either. And it did provide us with many good things (such as film).    And I still don't see any reason to believe that the purchasing of byproducts is morally distinct from the purchasing of meat.   This is a thorny issue, I agree. From a consequentialist perspective, I think the distinction is very clear - purchasing meat directly causes harm, while purchasing by-products most likely doesn't. Thus, the former is morally wrong, while the latter isn't.   From a deontological perspective, or from a virtue ethics perspective, the issue is not as clear cut. I'm willing to concede that from those views, buying animal by-products is probably morally wrong.   However, I'm personally leaning towards the view that while consequentialism is probably not adequate in itself as a moral system, it does provide the best guide to evaluating events afterwards. I'm not sure that this is even logically coherent though, so it's a very tentative stance.   Anyway, to sum up my position: the killing of animals for things we don't need (such as meat) is wrong, and was wrong through recent history. Nevertheless, given that this was going on, I think it's a good thing that the by-product was taken care of and used for good things, one of which is film."

TrueFilm,38k2n5,jugular_majesty,41,Thu Jun 4 19:06:37 2015 UTC,"Among other things, the film is a comedy, but Toshirô Mifune doesn't play comedy in the Will Ferrel way. Instead he is subtle in his comedy, and shifts between that, and cleverness, thoughtfulness, desperation, and violence at will.  He also plays different roles (as needed to advance his goals) in front of the rival gangs.  How many action films can you think of ask this much of the lead and the lead delivers?  Though the film has elements of a comedy and a drama it is obviously an action film first.  For that reason, I think it ought to be evaluated as a film in that genre. The worst action films have a good guy a bad guy and good guy vs. bad guy violence is what helps the two resolve their conflict. Better films involve elements like theme, tactics, subplots, and so forth.  This film is not one big action sequence.  The violence does not take up the bulk of the film, and comes in fits and spurts.  Rather than going from a shoot out to a car chase to fist fight in order to maintain momentum (as a modern US action film would do), we switch from violence to slower dramatic scenes that help us see the character and the tactics.    Yojimbo is heavy on theme. This film is not just action for actions sake.  Most American action films are about plot, special effects/violence, and characters (usually in that order).  Some people look down on a film that has a simple or well worn plot. Not me. If a film has a theme at its core, I could care less about how sophisticated or original the plot is. Among other things (and I quote from Ebert) ""Yojimbo"" is more subversive: The samurai were famed for their unyielding loyalty to their employers, but Sanjuro, finding himself unemployed because of the collapse of the feudal system, becomes a modern man and is able to manipulate both sides because they persist in thinking he will be faithful to those who pay him.""  The film deals with a transition from the classical era to the modern era.  Is the protagonist a hero, or anti-hero, or something else?  What values should and do anchor the modern fighter?    I honestly can't think of a better photographed, paced, or acted action/comedy off the top of my head.  But if that isn't your thing, then you wouldn't appreciate this film that much."

Sadly, these days special effects comes before plot. A friend recently told me of something he'd seen - interview or making of - about Ghost Protocol. They filmed all of the action set pieces first, then sat down and wrote a plot to thread them together. Finally, they filmed some exposition in Vancouver. There are some deleted scenes on the DVD that seem to bear it out - conversations that make no sense in the context of the final movie. It's disheartening to think that might be how blockbusters are coming to be made, or even that it's possible to do it at all."

This kind of critique makes a lot of sense if we are approaching things from a screenwriting perspective. However, the genius of Kurosawa is in his visual storytelling choices. On your next viewing look more closely at the framing, camera movement, editing, visual metaphors, etc.  Perhaps this is the problem with discussing film through the lens of auteur theory. It's always difficult to pin down where the director's input begins and ends. There are just far too many people/roles involved in making a film to attribute any given moment/choice to one person.  Still, saying that a film's value boils down to ""pretty good cinematography"" is reductionist. The director directs the dp, production designer, writer, actors, etc in an effort to convey the emotion and themes latent in the barebones story. I think if you look closely, you will see some evidence of Kurosawa's focus on this kind of approach to the material. He doesn't just shoot the script as is, he or someone under his command has taken the time to think about how best to convey power dynamics, theme, etc through audio/visual means.  A lot of people are put off by the admittedly corny moments in some Kurosawa (as well as in the Leone films that drew from them). Maybe that's the root of the problem.  You won't love every film, but focusing on what is does well can teach you a lot (and maybe help with your own films/art/analysis).  Oh, and if you want a Kurosawa film where his storytelling choices and stylistic flair are on full display, please check out High and Low (it's a personal fave)."
TrueFilm,38k2n5,BuonoBruttoCattivo,3,Thu Jun 4 20:36:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I see where you are coming from and I try to look out for how he effectively can ""convey power dynamics, theme, etc through audio/visual means,"" and that's sort of what I meant when I said ""pretty good cinematography."" It doesn't just look good but it is grounded on some emotion or point. I really, really liked the ending sequence of Seven Samurai when the villagers were planting rice with their songs and the samurai stood at the graves of those killed. I thought the samurai's feeling of loss and sacrifice were conveyed beautifully, and I remember one of the samurai says something to the effect of ""the villagers won but we lost"" and I almost wish that line wasn't included because I could feel it without any dialogue necessary. I will definitely try to check out High and Low because I want to see these types of devices applied to something other than what I feel is a conventional action movie plot.  EDIT: Added spoiler tags just in case because I guess this thread is technically about Yojimbo, not Seven Samurai."
TrueFilm,38k2n5,Monteitoro,7,Thu Jun 4 22:04:52 2015 UTC,"I loved Yojimbo and I think it stands on it's own as a great film. The influence it has can't be ignored though. Sergio Leone was actually sued by Kurosawa because A Fistful of Dollars was pretty much a plagiarism of Yojjmbo. I watched Yojimbo and Sanjuro very close together and I actually liked Sanjuro alot more. Sanjuro seems to get less attention but I highly recommend it. Especially this one scene in the end of Sanjuro but I won't ruin anything. Also Toshiro Mifune is the star of these 2 films and he's the fucking man. These 2 families are basically at war and Yojimbo sort of stirs the pot more, that is one explanation for why the gang would burn down the house. Things got out of hand. It has been a few years so my memory on the plot is a little shaky. EDIT: I see someone mentoned High and Low and so I had to reiterate that. High and Low is the bombdiggity and had me glued to the screen, probably my favorite as well. It's the original ransom/murder/mystery thriller. It is much more serious in tone than some Kurosawa like Yojimbo if that's what your after."
TrueFilm,38k2n5,kingofthejungle223,4,Fri Jun 5 03:43:55 2015 UTC,"The influence it has can't be ignored though. Sergio Leone was actually sued by Kurosawa because A Fistful of Dollars was pretty much a plagiarism of Yojjmbo.   And interestingly, Kurosawa's Yojimbo was an uncredited adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's novel Red Harvest, but Kurosawa was lucky enough to escape litigation."
TrueFilm,38k2n5,jpdd751,13,Fri Jun 5 16:15:23 2015 UTC,"Kurosawa's films revolutionized mainstream American cinema. Lucas' Star Wars heavily borrows elements from The Hidden Fortress. Seven Samurai is groundbreaking because it was such a character-heavy action film that had very impressive battle sequences. The characters are likable and make the ending more powerful. It combined character driven drama with stunning action.   Kurosawa essentially helped make what you are calling ""the conventional action movie"". He helped push the boundaries of what film can do. Rashomon revolutionized cinematic storytelling in its variant perspectives and playing on the audience's expectations.   A good example is the modern art piece the Black Square. Sure, anyone could have done it. But the point is that he was the first to do it. I watch a lot of action movies, some bad more than good, but Kurosawa changed American cinema. His work set the stage for the many modern films we cherish today.   If you say Yojimbo is illogical, just read Romeo and Juliet. It is a cherished piece of literature but it's bullshit romance. Romeo just said how much he loved Rosaline and then falls in love with Juliet at first sight and proclaims love for her despite his friends dying and sending his town into chaos. A lot of character choices in the play are illogical but make for great drama. I personally do not believe Yojimbo is illogical, though.   I would read up on what more modern directors have said how Kurosawa influenced their work and you may be surprised how far of a reach his influence has had over world cinema."
TrueFilm,38k2n5,kotomine,15,Thu Jun 4 20:15:50 2015 UTC,"I'm slightly uncomfortable about this response because it seems to imply that cinephiles appreciate film history more than they appreciate the best films ever made.  Related to the OP's question is the question of whether Yojimbo is good on its own merits or whether it is just important historically.  You might argue that you cannot separate the two, but I think you can.  Let's say someone wants to see a good movie, it doesn't matter what genre, they're very patient and have a high tolerance for art films, etc., but they don't care about film history at all.  What do you recommend that they see?"
TrueFilm,38k2n5,ShutUpWoodsie,5,Thu Jun 4 21:51:34 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, see, I never really look into an artist's influence. I always just judge works equally, ignoring their history or authorial intention. I've certainly seen other movies that fall under this category of revolutionary at the time but not holding up as well today. Thanks, though. I actually had no idea he influenced action so much, but I can see it. I will definitely say his movies have great visual quality.  Also I'm fine with illogical plot as long as it has a purpose like in Hamlet you have to accept the premise of a ghost. But, I don't know, in Yojimbo I didn't feel like the plot had any profound implications."
TrueFilm,38k2n5,Sawaian,2,Thu Jun 4 21:57:06 2015 UTC,"Where would one find more information on the evolution of action movies? I never thought of Seven Samurai as being revolutionary due to it's focus on characters.  What were 'action movies' like before Seven Samurai? And what is the line between an 'action movie' and an 'epic'? Seven Samurai runs extremely long, I would think of it more in terms of an epic."
TrueFilm,38k2n5,terminalmanfin,4,Fri Jun 5 07:16:07 2015 UTC,"Hello,  As a huge Kurosawa fan (kuro-Sawaian), I'd like to impart my thoughts on the film.  You're focus is on plot but then you deviate to story/character. It also helps to understand who Yojimbo is from a historical and cultural sense. Yojimbo is not a real person of course, but if he were, he would loosely be based on masashi miyamoto, a great samurai warrior who was highly unconventional in about every fight.   Yojimbo is a samurai, but not just any samurai, he is a Robbin. A ronin is a master less samurai as all samurai that were not ronin served under a lord or were a lord. He is basically a roaming knight. This means, depending on the Era, that he would be educated in some way.  He is quite the oddball, and he is better and trickery than he is at swordplay, but that isn't to say his swordsmanship isn't good. He can be quite stiff, so he rolls his shoulders, and he isn't too obsessed with a name or title. For a samurai to not care about his name or previous title is a samurai who is not burdened by the pride of status. His virtue is most considerably good and his roaming is part of his duty to the people. On one end, Yojimbo serves the people, protects the weak. For this, he is a courageous and virtues samurai, on the other hand, he is master less and quick to deceit, which is undesirable. However; he more than likely learned his deceit in the politics of Samurai lifestyle. Whatever the case, he is both the good and bad of the Samurai world.   The Gangs themselves are Bandits who have taken hold of the village. In this time period, the Tokugawa shogun has long existed but is finally meeting its end. You can be sure of this as the main villain, played by Tatsuya Nakadai, brandishes a revolver in his hand. Japan stood in isolation after the sengoku war until the 1800's.   This was also the time of the floating world at its most decadent, so those virtues have necessarily effected society as a whole.  The film masters its story telling through visuals. The opening scene with the dust kicking up says the town has been through something terrible. Whether it's drought, devastation, it visually appears to be lacking in life. The harsh light gives a sense of heat and weight to objects. The town itself looks like a pleasure district, very floating world with its multiple second story buildings and finer sliding screens in the town square.   And then the dog shoots across the screen with a human hand in its mouth. Things are truly as bad as They appear. So, Yojimbo arrives at a point of desperation. He visits the local inn keep whose given fair warning too the young ronin, but he has already made up his mind by this point.   The bandits were mostly comprised of uneducated people around this time. Perhaps some samurai here and there. If you were to step back and look at the film again, it's about a master less samurai helping the regular people become freed from the oppression of bandits.  It's a film about someone who is not being told to act just to be just in delivering the average man from his oppressors who are lustful, greedy, decadent, and power hungry. The first three are themes you will find in many ukiyo-e paintings as they convey the floating world. These people are so rotten that nature has dried up from their terribleness.  Edit: Wrong name. Toshiro Mifune changed to Tatsuya Nakadai"
TrueFilm,38k2n5,Sawaian,3,Fri Jun 5 04:05:40 2015 UTC,"Slight correction, the villain is played by Tatsuya Nakadai."
TrueFilm,38k2n5,PuzzlerDad1212,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:55:56 2015 UTC,You're right. I need to correct that. Toshiro Mifune was Yojimbo. I totally spaced it there. What's even more embarassing is I got to meet Tatsuya Nakadai last year in L.A. :(
TrueFilm,38k2n5,OddWally,5,Fri Jun 5 19:05:38 2015 UTC,"Hrm, just watched this one for the first time yesterday actually, the serendipity!    My experience: certainly not a profound one, I wasn't reading for anything at all and I'm not horribly well-versed in the period (both the one depicted or the one contemporaneous to the film itself).  I do appreciate the Cold War analogy, it works and gives Yojimbo some historical heft -- perhaps not totally necessary...  I enjoyed it though.  Loved Toshiro Mifune -- I know, I know, ""unrealistic, selfless, super good guy hero character"" -- but that's a jaded way to approach it, I think.  The image of the archetypal Stoic...when it works, it works.  I don't think the frequency of the type necessarily depreciates the execution.  Same goes for the villain (Tatsuya Nakadai), I mean, we've all seen the Effeminate Pretty-Boy Cheat before, but I still dig it, love that concealed limp gun-hand.    ~~~  What really gave me the cinematic razzle-dazzle though...it's near the beginning, a scene in the inn, when the innkeeper, Gonji, gives this expository dump about the town and the gangs, by opening up various windows looking out on the town.  It's just a really inventive, clever way of establishing the place, the geography of the town, through intuitive visuals.  Really, I can't get enough of that inn.  Such a great little setpiece.  The way Kurasawa uses its walls (becoming windows, doors, as well as a fence that divides a woman from her child in one scene) is just super engaging, very spatially-minded.  I felt like Kurasawa used windows and doorways an awful lot for framing -- I love that.  Remember when...I think Seibei asks the samurai's name, and a window/doorway immediately opens on this idyllic mulberry patch (from which Sanjuro, comically, derives his name without hesitation)?  Sanjuro's behavior is amusing in the scene, but the image is a little surreal.  ~~~  Actually, I think the visual motif of observing could be explored here.  Not only does Sanjuro learn so much about the town by peeking through the windows of that inn...this occurs several other times.  He escapes capture by hiding in a box, then underneath the floors...and when he's being smuggled out of town in a casket, I think this is a crucial character moment, and pretty funny, he insists on being set down, totally risking being captured and beaten for a second time, just so he can watch (for enjoyment, he indicates) Ushitora's gang set fire to Seibei's house.  This is played for comic effect, and also, obviously, allows the viewer to follow the action as well, but this 'peekabooing' also gives Sanjuro a somewhat atypical characterization as a hero, playing in to his strange voyeuristic tendencies that motivate his meddling to begin with...  ~~~  Anyway, went on a tangent.  I'll just wrap up by saying...uh... The cinematography was consistently gorgeous and smart, some really fun performances, loved the set design and Kurasawa's use of it, and that soundtrack is fucking killer (!).  So groovy.  Was it an intellectual experience? Not for me.  Was it...logical?  I don't know, I didn't really examine the logic and I don't particularly care to, seems kind've arbitrary (no disrespect to OP).  I was able to sufficiently suspend my disbelief and that was enough for this movie.  Did it provide any deep and penetrating insights into the human condition?  Perhaps it could be read that way...  For me, it was just an exceptionally well-shot, well-mounted action-comedy with an effective lead (which is indispensable, I think).  I'm just starting to watch Kurasawa movies, I've only seen Rashomon, Stray Dog, and Yojimbo thus far...but if yer looking for more realistic, insightful, socially-minded material, I would strongly recommend Stray Dog.  The last scene (correction edit: the climax) is damned sublime, seriously."

That's tricky since movies get different release dates all over the world, with some countries experiencing delays of more than 2 months. This is especially true of smaller budget European films, to take a recent example like Clouds of Sils Maria. The release dates are all over the place.   I just think the sub is a bit redundant. For big budget stuff that gets wide releases like Avengers and Mad Max there's enough discussion online anyway. For smaller stuff like mentioned above, the amount of discussion is so small it's probably best to not segment it."

It definitely has a lot of similarities to Every Frame a Painting (even your cadence is strikingly similar lol) but I don't think that's a massively bad thing - it's not as if youtube is awash with EFAP rip-offs anyways. And YMS (who I noticed you're subscribed to) started as a RedLetterMedia rip-off, but now I prefer him much more. I noticed your subs are some of my favourite youtubers...

I'm kind of eh about this discussion. It comes up a lot in music as well, where it is probably a even more muddled situation. IMO, genres/categories don't really matter, especially not in the question of ""are they accurate"", but are most useful as just a semi-accurate and widely-understood way of talking about groups of films.   Like, although ""classics"" is an inane category when you actually think about it, it kind of makes sense when talking to someone about films, because there are a lot of people who just don't watch ""classics"", whereas I doubt there'd really be many people who'd say they watched ""horror movies"" and meant that they watched loads of '20s/'30s horror movies as well... I feel like they are almost two different ""categories"" in that sense.   It also depends on the context... like if I were just talking to a random person I might use vague terms like ""foreign"" and ""classics"" but if I were talking to someone I knew was a cinephile I would probably use more in-depth terms (New wave, new American cinema, J-horror, whatever)."

I see where you're coming from (though I'm really ignorant when it comes to music and the culture surrounding music, especially in light of how much I know about film, TV, and video games).  For me, I grew up with a mom who was born in the 50s and as a little kid I watched Universal horror films and Vincent Price horror films that she had loved. I also loved spooky kids shows, short horror stories, etc. So for me it was all tied together. But I know that isn't the case for the most people.  It's weird how much people adjust their language depending on who they're talking to, even in regard to film. I remember talking to a two good friends of mine (they're a couple and one is big into film and one isn't at all) and when I made some crack about the French New Wave one of them told me to get out, haha (it was his apartment). It's like, that's such an important and fundamental part of cinema! To the extent that you can get sick of hearing about it in film studies classes. But to him it sounded elitist, kind of snooty foreign and inaccessible. And he's still a great, intelligent guy. Maybe one day I can get him to watch Cleo and 400 Blows."

TrueFilm,38hp0o,eliphas_levi,2,Mon Jun 29 09:32:07 2015 UTC,"This video talks about methods of categorization and how a more basic view of how to categorize films (genre plus ""old"" and ""foreign"") ignores much of (most of?) what's important about an individual film.   If you're going to categorise movies (or anything, really), you'll need to pick out common traits / aspects of them to put them into categories. This by definition requires you to ignore most aspects of the movie since you're disregarding all its properties other than the ones which are directly relevant to your categorisation criteria. So if you're going to have some sort of practical category (having categories which take into account most aspects of the film would be useless since you're gonna end up with as many categories as you have films in the first place), this isn't a problem you can avoid. Generally I look at when the film was made, where it was made and what kind of budget it had. Seeing when & where it was made can give you a rough idea of the style (French new wave, American 90s independent cinema, Hong Kong action, etc), and looking at the budget can give you a rough idea of the scope of the film. Films with large budgets will often have more money to spend on production design, use more locations, spend more money on extras for crucial scenes, etc."

When/where/budget is a great method. In most academic reading I did, a lot of focus was put on to ""classical Hollywood cinema"" techniques of continuity, clear cause and effect narrative, etc vs more experimental ""art film"", like a lot of people mostly look at stuff on that spectrum. This works too but it doesn't really help me considering I love some art films and hate others and it can be kind of elitist (films made in the classic tradition can still be amazing and aren't less artful than some films that are tryhard/weird for the sake of weird/etc). I ended up on form/content/context (""context"" fitting well alongside your country of origin and time period). Any of these work, of course."

TrueFilm,38hp0o,kallol_chatterjee,2,Mon Jun 29 05:48:17 2015 UTC,"Hey, great video. Thanks for making and sharing.  Categorization is a subject I find fascinating. It's usually the first descriptor we go to when discussing and sharing art with one another. It's a valuable shorthand for casual conversation, but at the same time can create false impressions that color a person's perception of a film before they have seen it if applied carelessly. (I often find myself getting frustrated by people criticizing a film against the genre they were told it belonged in, without adjusting their expectations for what the film actually is.)  Categorizing film is akin to mapping a point on a graph. You need measurements along at least two axes to do so accurately. I like your use of Form and Content for these (with Context potentially providing a Z axis).   My own take on this graph would use Theme (or Motif) and Tone as the two axes. As example, you mention enjoying horror movies, and to me a lot of mislabeling of horror comes from the term being applied inconsistently to describe Theme, Tone, or often both in one nutshell. To my mind ""horror"" refers strictly to Theme. Most of the movies that commonly come to mind when one thinks of horror films from the past few decades are actually thrillers (Tone) with horror themes or motifs. But, you also have movies with comedic, dramatic, playful, romantic, and every other conceivable tone that use horror motifs to tell their story. Trying to encapsulate all of these under one genre is as absurd as someone saying they are a fan of the ocean genre, or movies that take place on or around the sea.  That's the problem with those Blockbuster genre definitions you describe. They give you a measurement along one axis, disregarding that this still leaves an infinite range of possible experiences. It's as helpful as recommending Dead Calm to someone because they told you they enjoyed The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie."

I can understand why you would think that the constant shifts between the two realities of the movie would suggest that it's a deconstruction of traditional narrative, but in actuality, it operates as a means of communicating his ideas more actively. Godard intercuts between two sequences: an elderly man philosophizing about life and a couple whose inability to communicate with each other ends up tearing them apart. He labels the former ""nature"" (that is to suggest that this is how Godard sees the world) and the later ""metaphor"" (a narrative exploration about the futility of language). The conclusion Godard reaches is that language is humanity's attempt to make concrete what we don't understand, yet simultaneously is a hinderance. The dog reflects a life without language: although unable to comprehend the complexity of life, he is able to be happy and free, absorbing the world visually rather than trying to explain it. He discussing the futility of language and, to make it specific to movies, the power visuals have at communicating ideas, feelings, etc.  Before I leave, I must critique your argument for sound design because you are completely off base. I recognize that the sound design is bizarre, but to suggest it is bad is to completely misunderstand the film. With a title like Goodbye to Language, it shouldn't be all that surprising that language isn't put on a very high pedestal. A plethora of languages are spoken in the piece and quite frequently Godard chooses deliberately to not subtitle them, as it's irrelevant anyway. The loud noises are meant to reflect what language itself is - just a series of noises we arbitrarily assign meaning to. So no, it's not bad sound design; it's a brilliant undermining of the auditory component of film. In any case, I would recommend a revisiting of the film with this in mind. I don't know how well-versed you are with Godard, but I know he can alienate many. To me, he's one of the greatest cinematic minds ever and, quite honestly, Goodbye to Language is one film in a collection of others that I would argue puts forth a great case for the future of cinema and there possibilities available to us.""  I would refrain from using the word ""pretentious"" simply to describe things you didn't fully follow or understand.  Goodbye to Language is very experimental, but pretentious it is not.  I also would hesistate to call it a film from a ""freshly graduated film student"" because the level of emotional and intellectual maturity presented in this piece honestly would have to come from someone far older.  My suggestion is give it another chance with a more open mind.  It's a strange film, it's by no means an easy film, but it's one that I personally thinks has a lot of truth and brilliance to it.  If anything, it's an incredible sensory experience, but it offers far more beyond that."
TrueFilm,38f4gy,afewthoughtsonfilm,-1,Thu Jun 4 15:51:35 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that you got something out of it, but to be honest I feel like you're looking deeper into it than the film necessitates. As humans we often imbue things with deeper meaning, paintings, sculpture even literature. We often draw parallels and find metaphors where there are none. I think it's more human psychology than anything else. Also, in my opinion it holds to the very definition of pretense ""attempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed."" but of course I could be very mistaken. Maybe it is more a visual essay in which case I don't think it holds as a film. Call it what you will I suppose, it's all personal in the end and for me it did nothing."
TrueFilm,38f4gy,copsarebastards,3,Thu Jun 4 18:29:08 2015 UTC,"That's fair, and I won't try to tell you you're wrong for not liking it, but I must say that given that he literally labels each portion ""nature"" (the portions with the dog) and ""metaphor"" (the portions with the couple) and frequently deliberately states his thoughts on the futility of language in exchange for visual meaning, I don't think that I'm  looking too deep into it.  The film explains itself quite explicitly, it's just mixed within a flurry of sights and sounds.  I really don't think that Godard infuses it with any sense of greater importance - that's simply people projecting onto it.  Pretension would suggest that the theme is obvious but it is treated as some grand insightful thing.  Goodbye to Language forces its audience to consider what he is saying through both visual and spoken language, so it's a challenging film, but pretentious?  I quite disagree.  EDIT: Moreover, to your point regarding that ""as humans we often imbue things with deeper meaning"" and ""draw parallels and find metaphors where there are none,"" this speaks to a much larger question of what is art.  While I don't outright disagree that people sometimes look too deeply into things (some fan theories, such as one presented yesterday trying to created a shared universe between Haneke's The Piano Teacher and Amour, are most definitely looking too deep into things), I would argue that most great art asks its audience to work to find meanings.  A film should not have to explain itself as obviously as a Nolan movie in order to be considered a great work; in fact, I would argue that such exposition is a sign of a weaker film, one that tries to tell an audience what to think rather than leave clues for an audience to interpret and make meaning out of.  Films like Eraserhead, The Tree of Life and Goodbye to Language are all incredible works because of the way in which they use visual language to stimulate an audience into considering different things.  They don't outright tell you what to think but if you put in the time, some really profound insights regarding life can be made from them.  There's a reason Godard is considered to be one of the greatest and most acclaimed directors of all time - he makes really profound films that push the boundaries of what cinema can be.  If you don't like it, that's totally fine.  But labeling it pretentious is just silly."
TrueFilm,38f4gy,nerga,0,Thu Jun 4 22:06:11 2015 UTC,"This response is such a cop out.  Especially the ""its all personal"" relativist nonsense. Everything is subjective maaaaaan."
TrueFilm,38f4gy,odintantrum,16,Fri Jun 5 14:51:52 2015 UTC,"Pretentious is the absolute worst insult you can throw at a film. Pretentious is saying ""I do not understand this, so it is bad"".  I have no see Goodbye to Language yet, but to dismiss any film as ""pretentious"" is tantamount to heresy for a cinephile."
TrueFilm,38f4gy,hydra815,7,Thu Jun 4 05:25:12 2015 UTC,"I fear you are being a little condescending here, calling a film pretentious isn't the same as not understanding it. Absolutely the question as to whether a film lives up to it's own claims for meaning and significance is a valid point of criticism. Some films are pretentious."
TrueFilm,38f4gy,odintantrum,17,Thu Jun 4 10:04:19 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that by calling a film pretentious that you are not really insulting the film that much but doing something much worse, insulting the audience who did enjoy it. I think it is possible to understand a film and still dislike it, as you said, but it is a dismissive buzzword that people use to categorise a film that didn't fit within their boundaries of taste. By labeling it as pretentious, you are basically saying that anyone who did enjoy the film is only pretending to like it in order to seem more important/intelligent/cultured than they are.  Calling a film pretentious itself is really not a valid form of criticism unless you have a reasonable amount of proof to back up that claim."
TrueFilm,38f4gy,hydra815,12,Thu Jun 4 10:44:18 2015 UTC,"I think you are right that pretentious does get thrown about a lot as an anti-intellectual buzzword to dismiss certain strands of art.   However that's not to say it isn't a valid way of describing particular works. Some films fail to live up to their aspirations or  can't quite bear the weight of the notions of importance that they want to. This is the very definition of pretentiousness. We can't just give a blanket pass to all films with grand intellectual intentions (no matter how noble) and not judge them on how those very intentions are carried out. That said I think you can have films that are pretentious and are no less interesting because of it.    By labeling it as pretentious, you are basically saying that anyone who did enjoy the film is only pretending to like it in order to seem more important/intelligent/cultured than they are.   No that would be if I called you pretentious. The film is different. My main point is that just as we should be wary of anti-intellectualism (which yes, sometimes, calling shit pretentious is a fairly good indicator of) we should also be wary of intellectual snobbery; of saying you just don't get it."
TrueFilm,38f4gy,odintantrum,8,Thu Jun 4 11:51:11 2015 UTC,"No that would be if I called you pretentious. The film is different.   Herein lies the problem with the word being used critically. Calling a piece of art pretentious only serves to alienate the people who enjoyed it rather than serving as any sort of valid analysis. You are telling people who did like it that they are prescribing more importance to something that doesn't deserve it. On the other hand, saying what you personally didn't like about the film and providing examples is excellent criticism.  Intellectually analysing a film is one thing but choosing what and what isn't ""important"" in an artists work or what it means to somebody is actually where the real snobbery comes from."
TrueFilm,38f4gy,hydra815,3,Thu Jun 4 12:15:55 2015 UTC,"Sorry but I think you are way off beam here. If we are honestly criticizing work it really shouldn't matter at all whether we    alienate the people who enjoyed it   It's just not our job to coddle people's treasured opinions. If I call a film pretentious of course it's valid analysis, it means that the film is attempting to impress by affecting greater importance or merit than is actually has. That is a valid critical response to a work of art. What does this film aspire to and does it achieve that? One of the most basic questions in criticism. You have to judge films on their own merit. Art house cinema often aspires to intellectual significance, it is almost the very thing that separates it from mainstream cinema, and some films will fail by their own criteria. There are bad examples of intellectual cinema. Some of that is bad because it is pretentious. Now no where in this equation does what an artists work mean to someone else come into it."
TrueFilm,38f4gy,odintantrum,4,Thu Jun 4 12:43:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that it should matter whether or not we alienate the people who did enjoy it, I agree that we aren't here to ""coddle people's treasured opinions"". What I'm saying is that describing a film as pretentious achieves only this and adds nothing to a conversation. Who are we to fully determine what a film was aspiring to and whether it achieves it or not? We can guess at these things and analyse them to the best of our ability but when it comes down to it, we can only determine, as an individual, whether or not this work of art appealed to ourselves. So by describing it as pretentious, what we are simply saying is that it didn't appeal to us without going into any depth about it. And that is boring criticism.  ""You have to judge films on their own merit.""  ...which is another reason that we cannot describe a film as pretentious. Not ""getting"" a film doesn't mean you are stupid, it just means you didn't understand something (possibly) complex the first time you came across it. If you were to describe a film based around Greek Philosophy as ""pretentious"" whilst not knowing a single thing about Greek Philosophy, then what would be the point of the criticism? The same goes for many other films, whose job it is not to ""coddle"" the audience.  EDIT: In all honesty, using the word in film analysis is absolutely fine by me as long as you back it up. My problem is that people use it as an all encompassing phrase that cannot be argued against without a long, drawn out conversation such as this one."
TrueFilm,38f4gy,copsarebastards,2,Thu Jun 4 13:23:11 2015 UTC,"I think you are confusing pretentious with not getting it. They are different things. For instance I didn't get Mad Max, doesn't mean I think it is pretentious.  Your imaginary film about Greek philosophy for instance could be pretentious it could not, depending on whether it is well executed. Does it add to the conversation about Greek philosophy with nuance and panache. Or does it simply assume by being about the ideas of dead Greeks it is doing something important.  When I use the word pretentious I am saying something very specific about a film. I am not saying I didn't get it. I am saying I thought it to be glib and shallow while trying to appear deep and meaningful. Roughly. It's getting difficult to do this without specific examples."
TrueFilm,38f4gy,odintantrum,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:38:36 2015 UTC,What you described wouldn't make the film pretentious. It would make it a failure thematically but that isn't the same as being pretentious. It seems to me like calling a movie pretentious is an empty criticism. The critic is being too cynical and dismissive. Any movie you call pretentious I am sure someone else can find something of generally agreed upon merit in.
TrueFilm,38f4gy,copsarebastards,2,Fri Jun 5 14:57:26 2015 UTC,I think you're a little late to this party but against my better judgement...  Are you really saying you've never seen a film that couldn't fairly be described as pretentious. Is it a non category?
TrueFilm,38f4gy,odintantrum,0,Fri Jun 5 15:30:55 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah I am pretty satisfied by the long string of comments, I hadn't read all of them when I replied. But I don't know. I have a hard time thinking of any. What I have seen of melancholia so far might be the closest to that description in my opinion but it's not fair because I haven't seen anywhere close to the whole thing.   It just seems like a lot people throw the word around like I have responded to some criticism of movies in a similar way that that write up on the Goddard movie did, and I think that can always be done.  I think maybe that calling a film pretentious serves a purpose, the person has a reason in mind when they say it, but I don't think it's ever justified. Or hardly ever at least. I can't think of any justified instance off the top of my head. Have you thought of any examples of pretentious films?"
TrueFilm,38f4gy,chlywly,2,Fri Jun 5 15:40:10 2015 UTC,"OK so off the top of my head the most obviously pretentious film I can think of, and bear with me a second with this, is The Room. Here is a film that the guy making it seems to believe is high art (or at least is cinematic gold) and yet is barely coherent. And it is kind of this fact that makes it funny, it wouldn't be funny if it were done ironically.   Now I know this is a world away from Godard, and I really like a lot of art house cinema (Melancholia for instance I loved) but I don't think pretentiousness is the death knell for a lot of these kinds of films. Most high art by its very nature has an element of pretentiousness to it, it has to even. It's only the very best stuff that overcomes that, and that's OK. I don't mind watching something that has grand aspirations but falls short.   What does bug me, and is the whole reason I waded into this, is dismissing other people's reactions as ""you don't get it."" I can find something pretentious and still get it. Finding something too obtuse or feeling a film doesn't reach the standards it sets for itself is a perfectly valid reaction."
TrueFilm,38f4gy,craig_c,0,Fri Jun 5 16:15:57 2015 UTC,"As with any film, I usually find some redeeming quality. Be it the script, execution, cinematography, acting. In this film, I was unable to find a single redeeming quality and yes indeed I found it nothing but pretentious. In fact it stunk of an aging Directors practical joke, either that or he's drinking way too much of his own coolaid. I tried to give the film an honest chance, I sat through the excruciating, mind numbingly painful cadance, dialogue, cinematography scene after scene. Oh wow he's split the images eye to eye.... and, frankly it looked like a 13 year old with a handicam who knows nothing about filmmaking shot an experimental film. Seriously, to say this was a deep film is really pushing it, so say it's somehow a marvel of filmmaking and so novel is also really pushing it. It's noting but the opposite in my opinion and I LOVE cinema."
TrueFilm,38f4gy,throwaway5272,3,Thu Jun 4 12:59:10 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, I've always thought Goddard pretentious and unwatchable, pretty much right from the start of his oeuvre. The odd moment of originality here and there is totally overburdened by all the mundane film making in between. He's the James Joyce of cinema, in so much as he has also spawned an industry of analysis of what is essentially meaningless experimentation."

I agree you are more likely to get to see a 70mm presentation of Lawrence again someday (more likely that than any other movie really) but I do like it a bit more than Goodbye to Language, which will probably also circulate again someday.  Since you haven't seen it before I'd lean toward Goodbye to Language BUT only if you actually like Godard already and know what to expect. Otherwise that movie may make you wish you'd gone with Lean."

TrueFilm,38f4gy,DieRealeAdolfHitler,7,Wed Jun 3 23:46:02 2015 UTC,"The number of opportunities that anyone on this planet has to see 70mm is diminishing at a rate that is quite simply horrifying. In 30 years the chances that you will be able to see Lawrence on any type of filmstock will be highly limited. Take the opportunity now, as many times as it is available to you. Goodbye to Language is a digital feature presented on DCP in widely adopted 3D techniques. Seeing this film the way the artist intended you to see it will not be nearly as rare an occurrence. Goddard is a towering figure of cinema, his films are going nowhere.70mm Film presentation is going somewhere, the dump, so take what you can while you can."

Farewell to Language only has one particular moment of brilliance in 3D, which is when Godard splits the cameras so that you are looking at a different camera-angle on a scene with each eye. It's insane to experience, but nothing compared to what I'd imagine Lawrence in its full glory is like."

TrueFilm,38fwpj,OtterLarkin,36,Wed Jun 3 23:13:17 2015 UTC,"I do not think you are entirely wrong. I agree that marijuana acted as a catalyst for the changes in his life but I do not believe it was a reason for the sudden change. The colonel in the end was not happy because for his entire life he suppressed his sexuality and I do not think  smoking some weed would have changed his outlook on Lester and his sons supposed relationship. The film definitely is pro-marijuana and it definitely does have an effect on how Lester views life but I am just not convinced that it was a reason for his change. It definitely was, as you stated, a catalyst for the change. The points you male are very interesting and made me think about how no one speaks about the ""marijuana aspect"" of the film."
TrueFilm,38fwpj,LebronNoRing,12,Thu Jun 4 03:26:34 2015 UTC,"I agree, the true catalyst was the rose fantasy. Seeing the cheerleader awoke something in him that reminded him of his younger self, causing his mid-life crisis.  Smoking weed was another such reminder of who he used to be before he got older and settled down, but it was definitely a large one for him, perhaps because it allowed him to escape his day to day anxiety, giving him some fresh perspective."
TrueFilm,38fwpj,splicerslicer,13,Thu Jun 4 05:04:58 2015 UTC,"yeah im with you, I don't think the weed was the reason, but more like another example/symptom of Spacey's character development. That being said it does play a bigger role then I had previously thought about.  Every time I watch this movie the meaning behind it and the  characters morph, especially when its been a few years inbetween. The first time I watched it in middle school I think it was more shocking than anything; I related to the daughter more than anyone - cheering on her 'brave' decision to leave the family, hating on the colonel for being so thick headed. Watching it after college the characters utterly depressed me and they all seemed so pathetic and lost, the daughters choices suddenly seem incredibly childish.I felt bad for the cheeleader while before I had disliked her. Im sure watching it when I am married and have kids of my own it will become a whole new movie again.  truly a masterpiece."
TrueFilm,38fwpj,Cerpicio,7,Thu Jun 4 04:00:00 2015 UTC,"Can actually relate to this in a big way. Hit hard times while being a regular weed smoker and had to move in with parents.  Out of respect for them I quit there and then and also as I hate all the sneaking around due to the criminality.   Got very depressed for a few years until I met a girl who was down with smoking, then it was just one stoner epiphany after the other and I'm getting my life on track in a good way. Maybe it affects everyone differently but it really has the effect of 'dissolving' any brain blocks that hold me back in day to day life."

Karl believes that in cremating the bodies he's setting their souls free and he becomes more and more obsessed with his job. It has elements of both horror and comedy and even some German expressionist influences. It's a really great moody, atmospheric film that has a lot of cool visuals.

Here are some films that stuck with me.   You want anti-Nazi action? Check out Closely Watched Trains (1966) a young man helps the resistance bomb a Nazi Train. Its slow moving with lots of building action and the themes of resistance resonated with the Czech youth at the time. For me the interaction between youth, idealism, love, and the crushing reality of life really hit home.  Valerie and Her week of Wonder. (1970) If you surrealism of Daisy's check this out. It was made after the Czech Spring. and probably passed censorship because it is based on a novel by a well respected Czech writer. This is a surrealistic coming of age story about a young girl. It was directed by Jaromil Jireš who directed The Joke another great film. Definitely check him out. Fireman's Ball (1967) Milos Foreman directed this and it catapulted him to international fame. Milos is interesting because compared to Jires and Chytilova he immigrated to LA and made hollywood movies. Most famously One Who Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest .  Finally: A Report on the Party and the Guests (1966) Is an absurd and at times painfully sadistic story about a group of guests being invited to a party in the woods by a very rich man. Directed by Jan Nemic who stands out in how unrelenting anti-authoritarian he is. This film was banned by the Czech government ""forever"" and after 1966 he did not make another film, unlike even Chytilova."

I think it is Jiri Menzel's best and it was only released in 1990's as it was banned before release after the soviet led invasion of 68."
TrueFilm,38aigu,Omega_J,10,Tue Jun 2 23:16:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a weird one because there's something of a distortion effect at work, at least for me. Both have practically perfect screenplays and great movie star acting, and both are very well-directed. Both are widely imitated. If we threw all film in the fire except these two we could probably re-learn how to make movies from them. But one is a very good film by someone who was a great director, and one is most likely the best film by a director who was not great. So ultimately I'm comparing Notorious to Hitchcock movies I like more and Casablanca to all the remakes and ripoffs of it that aren't as good.   I do think the comparison suggests itself when you watch either because they are both jewels of World War 2 -era mainstream cinema. But I think we need both equally."
TrueFilm,38aigu,lordhadri,6,Wed Jun 3 00:06:34 2015 UTC,"If we're just talking favorites, I prefer Casablanca by quite a bit. But, I also prefer Casablanca to literally ever other movie ever made. It's my favorite movie.  I think Casablanca has the better shooting script, better sets and a tone that gives the feeling of great depth and diversity. Casablanca adeptly juggles so many emotional arcs, it's hard to believe it all came together.  Notorious is somewhat flashier in its direction and has stood the test of time as far as a visual masterpiece. It may be the best looking film of its time outside Citizen Kane. I also think Bergman's performance is better. It's more nuanced. She has to reveal her feelings to the viewer but hide them from the people around her. That's a tight rope to walk.  I usually don't compare movies like this except for the sake of trivia and conversation. I own both of these movies and watch them with some regularity."
TrueFilm,38aigu,Deviator77,2,Wed Jun 3 03:51:19 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that you're willing to admit what Notorious did better than your favorite movie.  When I created this thread, I was hoping to do more than just talk favorites. Both of these masterpieces explore the love triangle and the theme of love vs. war but, in my opinion, in very different directions, resulting in two films that say very different things. I was originally hoping to discuss these differences and see which explores these and similar themes in a more satisfying, complex, or overall better manner and judge these qualities, their technical aspects, etc. to see which is the better movie overall. However, this thread looks like it's turned into my defending my opinion that arguably Hitchcock's first mature film is better than the 1942 Hollywood classic. I guess that's Reddit for ya."
TrueFilm,38aigu,HazMatt19,3,Wed Jun 3 05:40:02 2015 UTC,"From a technical standpoint, Notorious is a more carefully constructed film because it benefited from Hitchcock's auteur-ship. Casablanca has a much more studio look to it, because it was a studio vehicle directed by a studio director (Michael Curtiz). Not to dismiss Curtiz as a director, because a number of his movies are classics (The Adventures of Robin Hood, White Christmas, and Yankee Doodle Dandy to name a few) but that's the point; he was a guy the studio could hand big-budget movies to because he wouldn't do anything risky with them. He would direct them well and leave them alone. Hitchcock has a much more unique style as a director, which lends itself to making his movies more technically interesting.  From a story perspective, they share a number of similarities; a love triangle in dangerous circumstances. Both movies feature two male leads in love with the same woman and much of the story hinges on how that woman reacts to her lovers. Personally, though Notorious is more visually interesting, I would rather watch Casablanca. I think Bergman and  Bogart have better chemistry than Bergman does with Grant, and Claude Rains as Renault is infinitely more entertaining than his turn as Sebastian.  I'm not really sure how else you want to compare them. Which is the better love story? Which is a better deconstruction on the choice of love vs duty?"
TrueFilm,38aigu,lordhadri,4,Wed Jun 3 02:06:36 2015 UTC,"I personally find Claude Rains as Sebastian more interesting as a cork in Notorious because he's the most likable character in the movie, despite having the appearance of being the conventional villain. He's the one who truly loves Alicia (Bergman), while Grant's Devlin is kind of a dick in every way imaginable. I personally find this love triangle much more ambiguous and complex, even to its end, than the one with Victor Laszlo, a very uninteresting character.  I feel like both films tackle a similar type of WW2 love story, but Notorious is an ultimately more interesting and thought-provoking deconstruction of, as you say, love vs. duty. Is what Alicia and Devlin went through worth it? Were either Alicia or Devlin bad people in the way they treated each other and especially Sebastian? Did Alicia even end up with the right person? Is Sebastian really the hero of the movie? And to me, that's just the surface of the tension prevalent throughout the film. But I would love to hear other people's takes."
TrueFilm,38aigu,fannyoch,3,Wed Jun 3 02:57:36 2015 UTC,"I sometimes think only Michael Curtiz could have made a movie like Casablanca. Everything else went right for that movie but it needed a completely competent director to shoot it to be any good. Sure it's not personal art, but if it had been, it might not seem like such a purely prototypical hero vs antihero film that everyone else could make new films in dialogue with it.  I also wouldn't go quite as far as saying Curtiz never took risks. Sure he was the Ron Howard or J.J. Abrams of his day but he did drown all those people making Noah's Ark after all. (Top that, Aronofsky.) Also, despite lacking any personality whatsoever, he shot a few screenplays that are totally bizarre on their own and his directorial competence lends some of those movies that should be terrible a kind of deadpan quality. Maybe they only come off that way today though."
TrueFilm,38aigu,kingofthejungle223,2,Wed Jun 3 03:12:37 2015 UTC,"Notorious is my second favorite Hitchcock, after Vertigo. While I love Casablanca, it doesn't really come close to Notorious for me.   Both of the actors that were mentioned give better and more subtle performances. In particular, while Casablanca's ending gets all the credit- Hitchcock's final few shots make the ending of Notorious one of the greatest I've seen. It's such a logical, surprising, exciting, and understated reversal of fortune. I'm a sucker for audacious camerawork that's pulled off well, and I agree with Ebert that Notorious is the best example of Hitchcock's visual style. I feel it is rather underrated among his filmography by many.  Casablanca is a great film, but most days I'd rather revel in the twisted beauty of Nototious."
TrueFilm,38aigu,kingofthejungle223,3,Wed Jun 3 12:28:08 2015 UTC,"Someone agrees with me! For my favorite Hitchcock, I also have a tie between Vertigo and Notorious—as well as Psycho. Hitchcock is the Master for a reason."
TrueFilm,38aigu,sean0525,2,Wed Jun 3 18:26:41 2015 UTC,"It's natural to compare Notorious and Casablanca - both feature a love story that gets complicated by political entanglement in the WWII-era, and both feature stellar performances from Ingmar Bergman and Claude Rains, as well as a leading man who uses a facade of toughness to hide his inner emotional wounds.  But, as you point out, Casablanca is the more popular entertainment, while Notorious is an undeniably superior work of art.  Of course, I happen to find Notorious more satisfying as entertainment as well.  Casablanca has never really connected with me on a meaningful level.  I appreciate the performances of Bogart, Bergman, Greenstreet and Lorre, but as a whole film, it's never struck me as something that transcends the studio wartime potboiler - if it's better than other contemporaneous Bogart vehicles like Across The Pacific, Action In The North Atlantic, or Passage to Marselle, it's only by a matter of degrees.  It isn't half as good as Bogey's later turns in To Have and Have Not, The Treasure of Sierra Madre, or especially In A Lonely Place, not to mention his earlier breakout performance in Raoul Walsh's gangster classic High Sierra.  Perhaps the greatest difference between the two films is that in Notorious, Hitchcock explores the twists and turns, the lover's deceptions and misunderstandings, and the guilt that resides in the tension between passion and duty as only an artist with a great personal investment in these things can (in fact, all of these themes were central to Hitchcock's work since at least The Manxman, his last silent film), while in Casablanca these same values remain mere dramatic conventions.  For all of Casablanca's mists of cigarette smoke, its ever-present piano schmaltz, and its gauzy closeups of Ingrid Bergman, there is a greater emotional truth revealed in the naked, visceral humanity that Hitchcock captures with a 360-degree swirl around Grant & Bergman's climactic reunion near the end of Notorious.  The only part of your post I'd quibble with is labeling Notorious Hitchcock's ""first mature feature"".  It's a masterpiece to be sure, but Hitch produced a lot of mature work before that.  Even if one doesn't want to count Foreign Correspondent, Suspicion, and Lifeboat (which I would qualify as 'mature'), one simply can't ignore Shadow of a Doubt, which was Hitch's favorite of his own films (with good reason)."
TrueFilm,38aigu,otherpeoplesmusic,2,Wed Jun 3 14:38:36 2015 UTC,"Wow, it seems like you have seen way more Bogart movies than I have. And yes, I probably could have phrased that description better. I agree that at the very least Shadow of a Doubt deals with mature themes. I suppose a better modifier would be to describe it as arguably his first mature love story."
TrueFilm,38aigu,tierras_ignoradas,2,Wed Jun 3 18:32:02 2015 UTC,"I suppose a better modifier would be to describe it as arguably his first mature love story.   Yeah, I can see what you mean there."
TrueFilm,38aigu,tierras_ignoradas,2,Wed Jun 3 19:00:46 2015 UTC,"which is better is less important than the criteria used to make that judgement.  People who prefer one over the other probably have different criteria. For example in terms of cultural influence, measured by lines and images from the film that are know in general culture (here's looking at you kid, play it (again) Sam, etc), one play and numerous visual puns, Casablanca has had much more influence.  But in terms of innovation, Notororius was more innovative   While Curtiz has less status than Hitchcock, his list of films is quite impressive (mildred pierce, captain blood, charge of the light brigade, angels with dirty faces, yankee doodle dandy, passage to marsaille, etc) and covered more genres than Hitchcock.  His career ranged from 1912 to 1961.  Hitchcock certainly made great movies but they were all, or almost all, a single genre - suspense thrillers.  .    I doubt there is any consensus on what makes a great film when comparing films that have achieved classic status, as opposed to ""attach of the killer tomatoes"" which has high camp status.  If we focus on what makes each movie great we can honor both"
TrueFilm,38921m,HeadlessMarvin,24,Tue Jun 2 18:17:34 2015 UTC,"I think one thing that Tarantino does well versus some other filmmakers who use excessive violence is that he does a good job of setting it up. With his movies you seldom watch two hours straight of over the top violence. Django is a perfect example where most of the movie is dialogue, character development, and tension building to a break point. The violent scene serves as a release for the viewer from the tension created in the first part of the movie. When a film just jumps straight into needless violence I think it gets more boring and repetitive, but Tarantino and other similar directors do a good job of setting up so there is an apparent motivation for the violent scenes."
TrueFilm,38921m,awesomeness0232,15,Tue Jun 2 20:07:49 2015 UTC,"A great example of that building tension that Tarantino exhibits was everpresent in Inglorious Basterds.  That scene in the basement pub was an extremely tense and elaborate preface to the violence that was going to inevitably erupt.  Tarantino often uses his clever dialogue to build up to this moment of violence, and then, like you said; release for the audience.  Often times, the violence is not very prolonged (albeit extraodinarily graphic)  Think of most of his ""pinnacle of violence"" scenes, in all of his movies.  Excluded Kill Bill. They are often short and sweet, with a lot of mess to clean up after."
TrueFilm,38921m,Morningstar269,4,Tue Jun 2 20:37:26 2015 UTC,I agree. Inglourious Basterds is probably a better example of my point than Django because it sort of happens at different points throughout the movie. Though I do think the scene where Dr. Schultz shoots Candie is a huge release from the tension that was building since they first met. Basterds was really good at this. The opening scene is almost like the perfect representation of this technique and how great Tarantino is at it.
TrueFilm,38921m,awesomeness0232,6,Tue Jun 2 23:01:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with u/Morningstar269. The tension buildup in Inglorious Basterds is palpable, whereas with Django Unchained, the editing felt off, so I didn't feel much tension where tension is supposed to be felt, e.g. the dinner scene."

TrueFilm,38921m,nickchic,4,Thu Jun 4 21:16:26 2015 UTC,"I think Tarantino does a good job justifying the violence that heroes perform, and punishing the violence that the antagonists perform. His characters that are more morally ambiguous are never portrayed any other way. He doesn't try to polish up these characters. The boondock saints on the other hand are morally grey but are portrayed as the ultimate good and morally correct. Making their violence seem a bit less needed. And when there is no reason for it people tend to lash out.  Also a small portion of Tarantino's violence can be cartoonish. In Django and Kill Bill especially. I think that lightens the blow a tad. Although I realize most of his violence is realistic."
TrueFilm,38921m,Deviator77,5,Tue Jun 2 20:54:11 2015 UTC,"Tarantino is given a hard time about violence in his films all the time. Other than Eli Roth, I can't think of a director who has been given more grief than Tarantino over the violence in his films.  The audience forgives Tarantino because his movies are good.

It's definitely very violent, don't get me wrong, but the movie seems so controlled that it doesn't seem excessive or out of place.I think really the answer to your question is that if you watch it and truly feel like you're watching an ""exploitation"" film, it probably did something wrong. Yes Tarantino's films are inspired by the exploitation movies of the 70's and 80's but I think everyone agrees that they're something more. I think if the movie really feels like it's there to exploit rather than to inspire or entertain, then I think that's the line. Still a pretty ambiguous answer, but I agree it has some to do with intention, in that intention plays out in the overall tone of the film."

TrueFilm,38921m,Strucci,2,Wed Jun 3 06:47:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is some objective line for violence. Tarantino has been persecuted for his films portrayal of violence especially earlier in his career. Personally, I adhere to his views on violence. He had said, in a hostile interview, that it's a movie and that it should be treated like one in response to the journalists reluctant questioning of violence in films. As to why Duffy gets shamed and Tarantino doesn't is because Quentin probably has a more accomplished body of work and has become essentially an a-list director so most people have accepted the violence present in his films."

I never really cared about the realism of either of their works (Reservoir Dogs, for example, is a fairly realistic movie, especially compared to Basterds or Django). I haven't seen his film in ages but I got the feeling Duffy hates women and black people and thinks killing is cool from it. Tarantino's work can certainly be problematic and warrants critique but I never, ever feel that gross watching his stuff.  Four years ago I wrote a post for a blog run by some people I knew about Tarantino's influence and the last paragraph turned into an angry hit piece on Duffy, haha. http://httproductions.blogspot.com/2011/04/httpresents-influence-of-tarantino.html  Here's what I said-  While Tarantino's films can speak volumes about humanity, honor, and sacrifice, they're also fairly violent and profane, and some filmmakers only bother to try to produce the latter. They attempt to recreate the “cool” feeling of Tarantino's movies by filling theirs with careless, gratuitous violence and meaningless dialogue without ever touching on anything with the slightest bit of intelligence or gravity. It ends in aping and mediocrity, like in the boring and contrived Lucky # Slevin, the flashy and colorful but incredibly shallow Smokin' Aces, and the awful, offensively overrated, and soulless Boondock Saints. For example, while Pulp Fiction has extensive use of racial slurs, it also has African-American characters who are fully developed and just as prominent and interesting (if not moreso) than their white counterparts. Boondock Saints uses racial slurs for... comedy? Tarantino's movies sometimes include violence against women, sexual assault, sexist characters, etc, but he balances it fairly well with prominent and fully developed female characters. His women are just as capable of humor, violence, profanity, and revenge as his men, and for the most part they serve just as much of a purpose (rather than existing as objects or stereotypes). Boondock Saints has Rocco groping an unconscious woman and violence against a massively stereotyped lesbian character... why, now? Reservoir Dogs ends in massive sacrifice after a film that debates extensively on the morality of “professional” criminality and Pulp Fiction uses the stories of several very different characters to speak on loyalty and personal philosophy and redemption through words and action, such as in Butch's choices about the watch and whether or not to risk his life to save Marcellus or in the differing views of Vince and Jules on miracles and on their line of work. The depth and morality of Boondock Saints, however, is essentially “something something Catholicism” and “killing people is cool”, and it as a whole is fairly exemplary of the awful, bottom-of-the barrel, and intellectually barren Tarantino copycat cinema still being produced nearly twenty years after Pulp Fiction's release."
TrueFilm,38921m,don_dimelo,-3,Thu Jun 4 08:03:26 2015 UTC,"Tarantino becomes too much as soon as the words ""Directed by Quentin Tarantino"" come up on the screen.  He's a hack.  It's that simple.  He really does mean to provide shocking violence and gore.  It's just that the films are so boyishly simple and flat, that you have no choice but to interpret it as a cartoonish parody of any real filmmaking.  Tarantino is essentially the developmentally-disabled friend we all tolerate and fawn over because only the mentally-retarded would garner any pleasure at all from such trash.  Pedantic, insulting appeal to our shiny surface justice sensibilities.  Stock-standard exploitation of not only our grindhouse predilictions, but our enforced Politically-Correct social model.  This guy has wormed his way into the public consciousness by exploiting things that people just can't speak against.  He is a knee-crawling weasel with the morals of a thug on speed.  (there it is).  Many people, myself not included, feel compelled to praise this goon for providing us with the 'corrected' version of commentary on race, Jewish-ness, and gender equality.  The guy is a hack, a bad one.  Oh so boundary pushing.  His movies are an insult to the sensibilities.  Django doesn't exist and couldn't.  It's an insult to every bonded slave to believe that someone like Jamie Foxx could just team up with Christopher Waltz and go kick ass on DiCaprio.  If it could have been done, it would have been done.  In the same way, shooting bullet after bullet into Hitler's face is just... stupid.... comic book, insulting, low-level trash.  Jews did attempt to revolt against the Nazis, did several times and killed many of the bastards.  Yet here we have Tarantino coming along to show us how it should have been done, how we might suppose he might do it if only we put his 8-year-old mentality in charge.  This guy is a plague.  He's an insult to the viewer and, because his insult is so colossal, he's an insult to every single slave, death-camp Jew, and beaten woman who has ever existed.  He's a cancer.  But, and if I may quote again, as long as Tarantino around, we always know where to look for the cultural enemy on the Low Road.  I suppose it might be said that you can also hate him for plucking every single rotten, worm-ridden, low-hanging apple in the fetid orchard.  Tarantino needs to be relegated to producing fast food commercials, but I suppose we can at least thank the immense social blind-spot which allows him to exist because it brought forth Christopher Waltz, allowed us to see another side of DiCaprio, and put Kurt Russell back in front of the camera.  In short, gratuitious violence in Tarantino movies is tolerated because he does it while everyone is in 'thrain' to the politically correct nonsense we all have to deal with.  Remember this:  In Tarantino's world, the enslaved Jews of the Holocaust should have fought back against Hitler and executed Nazis with baseball bats, because, after all, none of them tried, right?  Or does he get a pass for his shorn penis?  Fuck Quentin Tarantino.  His existence in film is an offense."

I tend to view the film as Kubrick intentionally messing with what people expect of an adaptation of a popular novel in general. So many things are changed from what King wrote in a very opposite way- Jack goes from burning to death to freezing to death, Danny goes from being unusually intelligent to near autistic, Tony goes from (Sort of) being explained to being unexplained, the supernatural was unambiguously real and then is much more ambiguous in the film, the novel has the characters leaving the Overlook a few times whereas the film almost completely isolates them there once the Torrence family arrives, Halloran becomes a hero in the novel and then a victim in the film etc."

TrueFilm,386qf6,theBelatedLobster,17,Tue Jun 2 08:45:41 2015 UTC,"The Shining is one of my favorite movies and this is how I see it: The way he worked was to suggest a lot of different concepts through cinematic language, but no one interpretation of the film is going to be perfect or make total sense as there is always something that seems to rule it out. For instance on the most simple level, there is is this a ghost story or is it all psychological? Major reviewers like Roger Ebert have gone on the record saying its all in Jack's head. But that is refuted by the fact Danny and Wendy see ghosts and Grady lets Jack out of the storage room. But it doesn't perfectly fit being a ghost story either, as the ghosts seem very much metaphorical versions of Jack's demons. Jack does not seem surprised at all to see Lloyd, and he knows his name. Mirrors are present with ghosts. The famous dog man scene seems to at least partially represent Wendy's discovery of her husbands perversions. One thing I do believe is in the subtext that was in Room 237 is a component of sexual abuse. Jack reads a Playgirl magazine and the Danny fire engine scene is mirrored with the Room 237 scene so Danny is to Jack as Jack is to the Lady/Old hag. Jack thinks he is going to have a nice moment with Lady, but it turns disgusting and terrifying. I believe that suggests (not definitely means but suggests) Danny thought he was going to have a nice fatherly love moment with Jack but it turned disgusting and terrifying.   All the Native American and Holocaust stuff I believe was intentional but not as a direct metaphor, basically as part of what in this movie the horror is. The horror is the bones of the past, and the river of blood upon which our society and country is built and continues to be built upon.   The Moon stuff I believe is only symbolic in that Danny's Apollo 11 shirt takes off and goes to Room 237/ the Moon which is a symbol throughout history of certain things like clarity, and reflection. So like Wendy seeing the dogman, Danny could be seeing his father for who he really is. Danny is not ever the same for the rest of the film after Room 237. He is Tony, the little boy that lives in his mouth. I have read that children who are abused from a young age can develop multiple personalities where the alternate persona is used to deal with the abuse and compartmentalize it, protecting the Danny child personality. That is another aspect of the horror of The Shining, the horror of the very personal what people do to each other, even in families alongside the suggestions of macro horrors like genocide and holocaust. Thats how I see it anyway. I don't think he faked the moon landings, but I do think Kubrick was a master filmmaker and was trying to make his horror movie as meta as he could to transcend just being a spooky ghost or slasher story."

TrueFilm,386qf6,theeab1993,6,Thu Jun 4 04:32:44 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with pretty much everything you've said. Personally, I always thought that the film was also criticizing modern America and how it continued to move along ignoring that the Native American genocide happened. I thought that the elevator full of blood was a symbolic form of representing the foundation of blood that this country was built upon. I also thought that the real horror of this film is not that there is some evil, supernatural thing out there trying to get you, but rather that the evil comes from humans, and even scarier, you could be the evil one and not be aware of it. Cue Jack's character. A former drunk, who's trying to be the ""man"" of the house by moving his family into a hotel where they clearly don't belong. And he ends up becoming the bad guy. I thought he was supposed to represent this American idea of ""natural entitlement"" and ""manifest destiny"", and how that turns men evil. It makes them feel righteous and justified and war-hungry. His drunken past symbolizing the dark past of the Native American genocide and how it seems like things have changed for the better, but in reality the evil is only waiting to be repeated. Eh, but who the hell knows? That's probably a pretty damn far stretch. Perhaps his true intent was just to drive people insane trying to analyze this movie... That evil bastard, gotta love him."

TrueFilm,386qf6,jac90620,10,Tue Jun 30 23:02:39 2015 UTC,"For myself, I always was more focused on the underlying issue of Father/Son. Maybe there was something that, that struck Kubrick on a deeper level about this sort of Freudian analysis of the removed husband/man from the mothers/ wife's desire. And how the child/son becomes an integral aspect of a decaying/fragile marriage. It's almost as though Kubrick was expressing personal struggles within the film. This seems more impacting to me than the very short lived Indian Genocide theory. That one doesn't seem to hold up for long if at all, really.   I've seen the film more times then I care to mention and I've always seen this as a more personal film for Kubrick than some statement about America. As far as the Apollo situation, well that's just...that to me is kind of stretching reality. Kubrick was a very very smart man and if anything was or did take place, I highly doubt Kubrick would  jeopardize his involvement."
TrueFilm,386qf6,kdk12k2k12,3,Tue Jun 2 07:13:50 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this one.  I always thought the film focused on the dynamics of the family rather than these, imo, really out there conspiracy theories.  I think the monologues about ""repelling a few Native American attacks"" basically compliment the ghost element - which I also think was the main interest of Stanley's.  The guy wanted to tell a horror story, something that he had not done.  We focus on a family thrown in a ghost vessel that ultimately takes a trip through a time warp paralleling a man delving into absolute madness.  It may be a simple theory but that's the one I adhere to.  I honestly don't understand the ones in that documentary and I'm really disheartened to think that film is taped onto the legacy of The Shining."
TrueFilm,386qf6,Xercies_jday,3,Tue Jun 2 09:06:51 2015 UTC,"I feel the film is about Abuse, plain and simple. Is about the Horror and Terror of having an abusive parent in the family and the emotional damage this can cause on the family. I feel the ghosts and everything else are just a metaphor, the ghosts come from a time where it wouldn't be out of place to be abusive to your wife so obviously Jack would harken to that time, and the two little girls are from a father that killed them as well, subtly showing that he was abusive probably.  The thing I find about this film that is weird that I do feel that maybe it might be about Real Jack relating to his childhood and that his wife and child doesn't exist, he is just writing about him as a child but also putting himself in the villians shoes as a way to come to terms with it. There are several shots like the dissolve at the start, a shot of the wife and child huddling above the keyboard, a random scene where Jack is just typing away and then it cuts to another scene without explanation, and others.  I feel the Native American stuff is window dressing and not really what the film is ""about"""
TrueFilm,386qf6,Alex__V,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:53:33 2015 UTC,"what   I know that it's not what the film is ""about"" but rather what the subtext is since everyone comes up with ridiculous conspiracy theories and obsesses about it, I just wanted to add my two cents to the conspiracy theories because most of them are even more ridiculous than mine"
TrueFilm,386qf6,ordash,2,Thu Jun 4 04:31:54 2015 UTC,"I find all the theories can provide extra interest when rewatching the film. There is definitely some reference to American history in a couple of places, but I think if you sat down hoping to interpret the whole film in this way, you'd really be lacking direct evidence (I'm really not sure there is a red, white and blue wardrobe - you're talking about a couple of outfits at most). We might be talking about happy accidents, or intentional Kubrick easter eggs - I don't think we need to decide which it is, but simply enjoy the film."
TrueFilm,386qf6,ordash,2,Tue Jun 2 10:52:41 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree because I see the same connection in almost all of his movies. Focusing mostly on the atrocities mankind is capable of, mainly alluding to war. I think he was obsessed with that part of human nature. Especially considering his intense interest in producing a Napoleon Bonaparte story and his constant references to war. I believe it's the underlying theme in every one of his movies, some more obvious than others. Paths of Glory, Spartacus, Dr. Stranglove, 2001, Full Metal Jacket, along with the more subtle thematic example as in The Shining. I think it's pretty evident that this was a theme he definitely wanted to bring to our attention."
TrueFilm,386qf6,PuzzlerDad1212,2,Tue Jun 2 16:18:26 2015 UTC,"It's not anger. This is a horror movie, essentially. He's trying to make you feel uneasy, not angry.  What is the underlying horror in America? It seems like a nice place, especially back then it did, very idyllic.  Nicholson harkens back to a time when the rich were rich and had grand secluded country clubs and vacation homes where high society would mingle. Just from the way he talks, his career as a writer, it becomes clear that he sees himself as closer to Anglo-Saxon high society America than the rest of his middle class family.  But of course all of this, especially the part of American history Nicholson has so much nostalgia for, was grounded very immediately in the displacement and genocide of the natives.  That is a constant theme throughout horror in America, the idea that there's something rotten beneath the surface, and that that has something to do with the fact that all our lives are only possible because of this genocide and re-forming of the land. It's similar to Lynch's Twin Peaks.  I don't think Nazis or the moon landing come into the film at all. I have no idea how that became part of the conversation.  It seemed to me to be saying that the more you hearken back to the ""glory days"" of America, which is somewhere between the Civil War and World War 2, the closer you tie yourself also to these dark forces and unclean desires that produced that epoch: reworking nature, displacing or killing the locals, bulldozing ancient holy sites.    I'd also hesitate to call Kubrick Jewish. He never identified that way publicly, and it's slightly suspect to assume his views on the holocaust from his name.  In fact, as part of the generation of American Jews who grew up before the holocaust (he wasn't raised Jewish) assimilation was the word of the day, distancing oneself from one's Jewish past.  His interests are very broadly American, with a specific emphasis on Western European history and culture; he was from a fairly wealthy, non-religious background, and I see no traces of minority identity in his films: quite the opposite actually.  He is trying to analyze social and power dynamics from a slightly ""outside"" perspective, and that may have something to do with being of Jewish background in a fairly non-Jewish environment.  But I don't think you can draw anything concrete from this.  Any great director is at once an insider and an outsider.  Dr Strangelove himself was based on Werner von Braun, a nazi scientist who was internationally famous because he'd launched missiles at British and French civilians and then had continued after the war to launch American astronauts and satellites into space.  This was a unique and contradictory character, but most of the meat of the film is in lampooning the generals, who at that time had unparallelled political power.  Everyone in that film is based pretty much directly on one historical figure."
TrueFilm,386qf6,ordash,-1,Tue Jun 2 17:41:56 2015 UTC,"Why is it, that a movie, that is very well made and great but not particulary complex spawns so much far fetched nonsense? Aren''t there enough interesting things to say about aspects of the film that are right before everyones eyes? Why is there a need for random banter about ""what it is all about""? ""A critique of America"", ""Kubrick as a jewish man"", my god. Talking about film should not be the same as rambling about random things that pop up in your mind."
TrueFilm,386qf6,indeedwatson,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:42:08 2015 UTC,I think the fact that there could be more to what's being shown is pretty hard to ignore sometimes. Consider an example mentioned in one of the above comments. There's a scene where one character drives past a wreck with an overturned semi sitting atop a red volkswagon. This scene is not from the book whatsoever and I'm sure cost a lot of time and money to set everything up and film to only be in the movie for about 5 seconds. They would not go out of their way to waste all of those resources to film something for 5 seconds thats not from the source material at all if it were completely pointless and not some sort of a metaphor. There's definitely a better reason for it being in the movie other than the character driving past some random wreck.
