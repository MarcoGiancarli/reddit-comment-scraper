applesucks,3dxcea,furyfairy,5,Mon Jul 20 08:52:44 2015 UTC,"Why?  Because iTunes is dying.  iTunes was once the world's largest music store - and the world's most popular too. When buying music came to people's minds, the first store they thought of was iTunes.  Until Spotify came along.  It was the first music service to ever gather a major attention from iTunes. For the first time in history, iTunes started to lose money.   Apple either had to get on board with the streaming craze or die of extinction. That is what Apple Music is. iTunes, reincarnated."

applesucks,3cywv2,flurgl321,-6,Mon Jul 13 07:48:55 2015 UTC,"First off, you shouldn't blame Apple for not having backups of your music, and for assuming that the iPad would work as a music backup device (they never claimed that it did).  It sucks that iTunes syncing is made this way, but as a programmer I understand why they did it this way initially. It makes the syncing implementation a lot easier if you can assume a one-way mater-slave sync, compared to dealing with multi-master syncing, handling conflict resolution etc.  Nowadays it should be less of a problem to implement this since they have to do it anyway to support iCloud, but of course they don't have any incentive to do so."
applesucks,3cywv2,Vipe777,4,Sun Jul 12 11:50:00 2015 UTC,"why the hell do we even need to fucking sync the whole fucking device?? i think with a 800-1000$ device (iphone) i should be able to plug it into my computer and put everything i want on it and copy everything i want off of it... just like EVERY OTHER GODDAMN SMARTPHONE/MP3 PLAYER EVER? but no, apple has to ""think different"" and ""invent"" some complete bullshit that straight up failed to ever work as a usable system, and now they ignore that its an unusable piece of crap.

applesucks,3cywv2,flurgl321,0,Tue Jul 14 13:17:14 2015 UTC,"This is not really Apple ""thinking different"". Other MP3 players like the Rio Karma also needed special software to transfer files.  For the 90% use case, iTunes syncing worked well. If you ever lose your iPhone or iPod, you can just plug in a new one, wait a while and you'll have the exact same setup on the new device.  Now, I'm not making excuses for Apple not having a convenient ""restore"" feature to get your data out of the device, but having a syncing system that doesn't realy on the user managing files on a file system has real advantages, that may or may not be interesting to you."
applesucks,3cywv2,Vipe777,3,Tue Jul 14 07:30:18 2015 UTC,"yeah that system is pretty cool. though google has solved this problem much better. when i installed a new rom on an android device and set it up the first time, i can choose to restore the whole device (no computer needed). it will download all of my apps, put them where they were, put all my widgets where they were, change the settings to what i had them before etc.   when i set up a completely new android device; i can just tap them to the back of the old one that is still set up (NFC ftw) and it will restore the exact same apps/settings/homescreens etc...

They really were innovative - once. Ever since, they are just another player."

applesucks,3d07e1,flurgl321,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:44:59 2015 UTC,"I think I would add that they seemed very innovative with the iPhone launched because they had worked on it in secret for years. If you looked at the software, all they really did apart from the Multi Touch stuff was to strip down OSX to its bones and adapt existing OSX apps to a small screen using the Cocoa Touch libraries. So having a working desktop OS that could be slimmed down to run on a mobile device gave them a huge head start.  You could argue that if you compare features from the first iPhone to the most recent one, there's a ton of new stuff there, but it doesn't seem very innovative since it's been added bit by bit, year by year, and competitors have also added similar stuff to their phones (Touch ID, Apple Pay, Siri, Facetime, high res display and HD camera recording / editing, 64 bit CPU etc.)."

We still get significant CPU, GPU screen and camera improvements every year, and we get new features that actually work instead of just being half-usable gimmicks (Touch ID).

Your IP address is never recorded, your visit is not logged and no tracking cookies are placed on your browser. When it comes to protecting your privacy, Startpage runs the tightest ship on the Internet. Our outstanding privacy policy and thoughtful engineering give you great search results in total anonymity. Here are some of our key features:  Free proxy surfing available. Praised by privacy experts worldwide. Fourteen-year company track record. Third-party certified.  No IP address recorded. No record is made of your searches. No identifying or tracking cookies used. Connection using powerful SSL encryption.   https://www.startpage.com/  IP is out of the Netherlands (out of FIve Eyes) and the results are encrypted, (https) however we know the NSA/FBI has backdoor keys to HTTPS, so you never should assume your safe from THEM. But from Google and Apple sure, provided you DON'T use their software. Mozilla Firefox has commuted themselves to users privacy, however if you use the default Yahoo then all bets are off.  All new PC's now have EFI, which is a powerful firmware that can contact the internet on it's own without going through the operating system. there is also AMT remote management in many Intel processors that it's on even if the power is off, by sending a special Ethernet packet over your ISP they can remote access, turn on the machine, install firmware/software and do what they want.  Safari sends searches to Apple regardless of search engine used. Google installs a rootkit auto-updater and has proprietary portions of Chrome that is not open source.

I think googles search personalization is awesome and very valuable when it works ,and using startpage loses you that.   I think Google sucks ass because they are a advertising company and they want to know the last time you took a dump or pulled your pud if it makes them money.  You likely haven't worked for a advertising/marketing company, I have and they are nothing but a bunch of manipulative bastards.  People think lawyers are bad, lawyers can be disbarred, but not marketing types. If they can learn enough about you, profiling, they can actually predict your behavior. They get paid more money the worse they are by getting better results at our expense. Their #1 client who purchases their data is the federal government.  So the object is to confuse their data, drown it out and block as much as possible of your real preferences and searches. There is software that does this automatically all day long for you.

A lot of that can be obfuscated or blocked if your using the right combination of add-ons and/or the right browser. Chrome or Safari is not, Firefox and Aviator is.  Sending a lot of noise is likely the best tactic, but if your visiting Reddit and AppleSucks daily then there isn't much one can do about that. If you use a proxy then it has to be very stable or else you'll have log in issues. If you use TOR then it looks like your looking for drugs or child porn and they watch you anyway.   So since resistance is basically futile, and any attempt by Apple to say otherwise is an illusion(and a lie) - why not enjoy the wealth of benefits Google offers    Why not use neither? Or at least confuse the results and tracking so bad that they can't use it?   now both Google and Apple have a lot of information about you!   Who says Apple and Google are not sharing customer data? Got to remember that Eric Smidt WAS on the board of directors for Apple.  Both Eric and Steve Jobs have been seen together in public places and conspired to keep Microsoft out of the smartphone market.

But It takes lots of work, you lose a lot of very valuable functionality from modern technology and it's plain hard, so it's not practical for most people, or at least most people prefer not to choose that path.   So for those people , a reasonable strategy is to mostly leak information to google(because it already knows so much about you and probably can deduce a lot).

""Most people"" in the world don't have access to modern technology and they are doing just fine.  Since the abuse of privacy and security is so bad on smartphones and computers, I just use them to a certain degree and the rest I conduct more privately which requires a warrant and the courts involved so my rights are protected.

applesucks,370rie,gnu1337,1 point,Sat May 23 20:07:33 2015 UTC,"Rants disguised as product endorsements.  The fact is the MacBook Pro is a crap machine for video production because it's graphics capability is behind similar workstation/gamer laptop PCs and OS X is just as hard, if not harder (because Apple insists on doing things THEIR way instead of the common sense way) than Windows 7. (yea Windows 8 blows, but Win 10 s going to fix things and it's a free upgrade)  Apple technically doesn't make a workstation laptop anymore, they are all 15"" with glossy screens, with integrated graphics (3 years behind current dedicated GPU's). Video pros prefer the 17"" anti-glare screen with a real dedicated powerful GPU so they can edit in the field.  Notice boy genius in the video has his MBP hooked up to a larger screen, really can't carry that monster with you on the go, but a 17"" one can and a second larger monitor really isn't needed. So you see why Apple discontinued the 17"", it's so they can sell you a external monitor.  Apple has given up on their pro market segment because they are not buying their hardware and because Final Cut Pro X sucks so bad. The commercial of the first rant video is designed to attract the dumb money crowd, ""look you'll get a computer if you join our school"" The fact is the video industry is mainly on Avid on workstation PC's because Windows/PC's have a more long term outlook than Apple which discontinues hardware and software at a blink of a eye.  Apple is a rich niche consumer product maker just out for the quick buck and no longer a serious long term choice for many professionals, unix programmers sure, but everyone else needs serious hardware choices and long term (like 10 years) of Windows security and support.  Apple upgrades (replaces it, updates are patches) it's operating systems annually, it's EXTREMELY disruptive and breaks software and workflows every year. It's the worst platform to use and the most expensive as it only has 5% market share and those doing video on Mac's are even smaller so the software is very expensive, why Apple has to produce FCP and video pro's hate it.  I used to be a big Apple fan because I like using the best of everything, the fact is Apple is not the best, except in shiny eye candy products designed to fail fast and get you back in to buy again sooner than you expected. Stability is on Windows, set it up, back it up and forget it.

applesucks,36cdc2,wewewawa,3,Mon May 18 06:39:16 2015 UTC,"This is a prime example of the Apple Stockholm Syndrome Effect. They have you so worried your stuff isn't being backed up fully so you stay focused on trying to fix the problem THEY are intentionally causing to lure you in and keep you trapped and paying them more money for ineffective solutions.  The whole concept of the ""cloud"" is fundamentally flawed. People don't have high speed internet/cell everywhere, nor very reliable. Not only that, some people take A LOT of photos (many of them private) and it's too much for the capacity of the device or for the internet/cell  service to handle.  It's almost like the iCloud concept was something thought up by David Rice, a ex-NSA guy in charge of Apple product security. They don't care if things are flawed, they rather have a peek at most of your data/pictures as it goes over the internet than none.  For backup, the best thing would be something integrated into the charger/stand so while it's charging it's backing up the contents to a traditional drive that could be removed and hooked up to any computer (PC or Mac) and the files easily accessed or reverse loaded onto a new iPad/iPhone if the old one is lost or broken.  That way everyone is backing up everything automatically while they are charging their devices.  There is the right way and then there is the Apple tormenting way. It's why AppleSucks."

Stop chasing the technological dragon, you'll never catch it as Apple will always have another brand new thing that doesn't work just right.  Take the iPod/iTunes for instance, it never sound leveled the songs from different albums correctly nor shuffled the songs correctly neither. Turn off the iPod and back on again and it would play the same dam songs over again.  I plugged my 16GB USB full of my favorite songs into the Microsoft SYNC and it just randomly played them and remembered not to play the same song twice until it exhausted the playlist, no matter how many times I've turned on/off the vehicle.

They latch onto the most popular tech company, buy a shit ton of their products, and force it into the curriculum to make themselves look cutting edge and modern. Pray tell, in what way does having an iPad (or any smart device for that matter) benefit the students or the teachers? None. It was done so that news sources could talk about this hip, modern school district giving each of their kids an iPad. Schools have an image to protect and build, and this was the easiest (albeit most expensive) way to do it.   Here's an idea: have each class have it's own Facebook page. The Teacher can upload links to the assignments, upload reviews and lesson plans, etc and the students can access them as needed as well as converse with each other if they don't understand something. The Teacher could have dedicated ""Facebook Hours"" much the same way that a college professor has dedicated office hours. And it would be free.

It would make sense if it was a college course on coding and building software, but for something like this, just for general schooling? There's no need. Like I said, they just wanted to be the ""cool"" school and were willing to waste a billion dollars of tax payer money on it. It's irresponsible of them. And then schools wonder why governments are cutting their funding.   Edit: I can't even forsee how this could aid in learning either. Kids would just get distracted, download Angry Birds or whatever and play that instead of doing math problems. Even if you locked them down and only allowed pre-installed software they'd still find ways around it, but even then, the kids would be distracted by the fact that they have the shiny sleek thingy to play with. It's just a dumb idea all around.

Apple is LOSING smartphone market share worldwide, the only market they are hanging on is in the USA.  So by getting iPhone users to pony up another $350 or so for a iWatch, they are trying to keep them locked in because of their larger investment, less likely to switch to the new Samsung Galaxy 6 which is coming soon.  It's likely why Apple came out with a gold iWatch now instead of later on once it's gotten very popular.  They are releasing gold one now to rip off as many people as possible right away because smart watches may indeed be just a passing fad  There is only so much that can be done with a small form factor device before hitting physical limits."
