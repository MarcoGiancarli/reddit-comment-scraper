ArtBuddy,3dyt74,jhuynh405,3,Mon Jul 20 19:27:50 2015 UTC,"Do you have a website you post these on or any social media pages I can follow/like?  Also for the backgrounds they're quite plain. I'm sensing you like a minimalist kind of style, so I think adding some depth and lighting to the entire scene (especially since it seems like they're in some kind of dark dungeon) would help quite a bit. Fantastic work!"
ArtBuddy,3dyt74,emoinua123,2,Tue Jul 21 02:57:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip! I have a lot of stuff on my Instagram @artelejandro and I'm starting to get my tumblr of the same name up and running to archive the art I put up there, but for the mean time, you can look up the tag ""artelejandro"" or ""angelejandro""."

ArtBuddy,3dpue6,zazo9,0,Sat Jul 18 14:34:05 2015 UTC,Does it have to have a goal? I take inspiration from all over and draw from that. Maybe it's a frase I hear and try to draw something from that maybe looking for pictures matching it giving me more inspiration. Mostly I draw because it's meditative and I can listen to music and podcasts while I do and get totally immersed and get to forget everything else for awhile.
ArtBuddy,3dqclb,rogueSleipnir,2,Sat Jul 18 12:37:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty good as far as anatomy, colour and values go (for myself, at least).

ArtBuddy,3dng99,McMee12345,3,Fri Jul 17 18:20:08 2015 UTC,"I suggest going over to pixiv.com (Japanese deviantart, basically) and studying how the artists do eyes and face shapes. Do some referencing/copying and then develop your own Manga style along the road.  For the rest of the human body, I'd strongly advise against using other people's work as reference, especially anime/manga illustrations. Do it the old fashioned way: pick up a Loomis book (many websites online has his books legally archived as pdfs), and draw along. Practice through repetition is key.  Proko's videos on YouTube are super helpful, too.  Drawing from real life or using a figure drawing reference site is a must.  Juggle between different references and sources so you don't get bored. Take it easy, and you'll improve."
ArtBuddy,3dng99,Klutonec,2,Fri Jul 17 23:31:36 2015 UTC,"A fellow manga artist!  Can't say I'm a expert, but I can point you to some youtube videos and recommend a few books.  Mark Criley is someone you might already know.  He's quite famous for his youtube tutorials, and he has a series of tutorial books you can buy.  I can't vouch for those since I don't have a copy, but given his videos they must have good content.  Watch some videos to see if you like them first though.  Sycra has a systamatic approach to learning to draw which I am fond of and even goes into experiments he's conducted to find his own styles.  He also does critisisms of art pieces people leave in his forums, so you can get a look into what he considers important (hint: triangles).  Will Terrell down to earth sketch artist who gives some good advice in general for people looking to take art to a professional capacity.  Not manga specifically, but great general advice.  Whyt Manga Is entirely about manga.  Haven't looked into him yet, but he was recommended recently so I'm putting him in for completion sake.  You can also find tutorials for almost anything on deviantart if you search for them and there are all sorts of books.  I'd recommend ""How to Draw Anime and Game Characters"" myself, gives some great points."

I'm using one solid and another textured brush then varying the flow+opacity manually. I'm satisfied with some of the parts. But I think the face needs more of the hard brush strokes.

I haven't really read any books or anything but am just experimenting with the whole medium.   My advice would be not to be afraid of putting on bright/vibrant colours and be wary of how you blend if you blend at all!  Also be sure to experiment with different ways of applying the paint, try drybrushing or just fill up your brush and experiment with texture.   Hope this helps :-)"

I'm looking to push myself to draw daily, though I probably wouldn't have finished pieces daily or anything.  I'm on the west coast of the USA, but I usually do fine with time differences. I do mostly digital nowadays but have been getting back into pencil."
ArtBuddy,3bqrly,follymiser,2,Wed Jul 1 16:28:27 2015 UTC,"Hello! Oops, off in what way? The links work for me, if it's the style - I did mean to put square brackets around the x's.  I don't think I'd be with new, finished pieces daily, but maybe more towards finished pieces every two weeks or less due to a busy schedule. Though, I would be more than happy to be around to give feedback however often is necessary if that would be alright."
ArtBuddy,3bqrly,follymiser,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:54:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry!  I was looking at them on mobile, and for some reason it didn't come out right.  It's probably just my app acting up.  Yeah I'm definitely not putting out finished pieces very often.  I think the big thing for me is to just get drawing.  I tend to have a fairly busy schedule as well, so it's a matter of making time.  I think having a buddy is a great way to motivate :) Every two weeks or less for actual art is a-ok.  Just having someone to bounce ideas off of or even just say, ""hey I made this thing"" would be great.  I've really been slacking on posting art to this account, but here's my instagram that has some of my stuff, and here's an album with all of my recent /r/redditgetsdrawn stuff.  I can PM you contact info if you'd like to buddy up."
ArtBuddy,3bqrly,follymiser,2,Wed Jul 1 17:08:42 2015 UTC,"Aah don't worry about it. :)  It's same with me, I tend to go long periods without drawing now that I'm not studying it. Then when I actually have reasons to draw, procrastination is an issue and I just need to push myself to jump into it. Sounds like a plan!  Just followed you on instagram - don't feel obliged to follow me back and have my non-art posts clogging up your feed. I'm considering creating a sub-blog for my art stuff, but that's a whole other thing I'd have to organise. Yes why not, let's give it a go!"
ArtBuddy,3bqd7y,RoyalGush,2,Wed Jul 1 08:21:34 2015 UTC,I'm like your stuff man. Do you mind if I color some for you?
ArtBuddy,3bqd7y,Pesk916,0,Sun Jul 5 04:53:23 2015 UTC,Hey man! I saw your art buddy post and I'm really interested in working with you! Here's some of my works https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BztXUmROWg5zR2E3TVp6bHQxWnc. I used to do most of my artworks in pencil but I've been moving to digital painting more recently. PM me if you're Interested! Thanks!
ArtBuddy,3bo95o,dbrylka,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:24:39 2015 UTC,wow! great job! you can definitely push the contrasts and colours more though!
ArtBuddy,3bo95o,frankfiorentino,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:17:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you! As for the contrast and colours - no, that's the whole point here - to be able to catch those gentle colour difference and paint them, which is not easy :-) Great effect with watercolours, though. Of course, in the end, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder."
ArtBuddy,3bnjiz,t0xic_,2,Tue Jun 30 17:24:49 2015 UTC,Heya. I would be interested being a mentor for you. I love seeing how people develop skills and your use of PS matches mine well. I'm available on Skype as well as irc and email.
ArtBuddy,3bnjiz,F4cele55,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:14:02 2015 UTC,"Hi! If you haven't already found someone, it'd be a cool experience to be your art buddy. Not sure how good of a mentor I'd be because I'd consider us around the same skill level? here are some examples but either way this seems fun. I'm on skype, so just PM me if you want, calls might not be a strongsuit though, my internet is pretty spotty sometimes."
ArtBuddy,3bjpll,LowCarbs,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:54:41 2015 UTC,I'd be willing to be your buddy :D. I want to work on digital stuff as well and our goals for our art is somewhat close! I also graduated high school so I'm about the same age :D hmu on skype: theverypinkgiraffe

ArtBuddy,3be1wn,seussdoctor,3,Sun Jun 28 09:58:11 2015 UTC,Maybe you could try and make the eyes a tad bit more similiar to one another. Also some more shadows/countours in the face would really bring it out more.
ArtBuddy,3be1wn,MayorMarla,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:04:00 2015 UTC,Eyes and contours. Got it. Thank you!! :)
ArtBuddy,3be1wn,knox_vile,2,Mon Jun 29 11:33:22 2015 UTC,Its hard to tell without seeing the reference image but I think either one of two things going on here. Either the nose is too short or the mouth is positioned too low.. Perhaps it's a bit of both.  Other than that it looks good.

ArtBuddy,3b39n8,Tdhgrafics,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:46:19 2015 UTC,I think it could benefit from stronger lighting in the cabin and a blue moon light.
ArtBuddy,3b39n8,Rhubarbist,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:13:17 2015 UTC,I'll have a look at it could be a nice idea. Thank you.
ArtBuddy,3b34k0,RimasAlbert,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:09:36 2015 UTC,"I quite like what you got going on. I admire your sense of color and shading. Though I question the level of detail on creatures that by the looks of it are meant to be cute (rabbit in particular). But it might also be a case of me missing the point completely and the creatures are meant to be cute in a off-putting way. Maybe something to think about.  Other than that I think the composition is alright, but when you place the subjects in the middle the sides tend to become empty even though you fill in with a blurred background. My suggestion would be cropping them to fit with the rule of thirds. Additionally there could be elements that further sets the tone in the surroundings. Following the Golden Spiral.  I also took a look at your ArtStation, your non-speedpaint stuff is impressive. Keep it up!"
ArtBuddy,3b0j7u,rebus_,2,Thu Jun 25 00:09:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it's just an effect of the scan, but I think it could improve if you push in some darker darks. overall the piece is very light-midtone, so adding more darks would help improve the value scale of the piece."
ArtBuddy,3b0j7u,Naluc,2,Thu Jun 25 06:10:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! Yeah, I see where you're coming from...I guess I've always had a predilection for ambiguous value schemes that seem to be fading in and out of the background."
ArtBuddy,3b0j7u,Naluc,2,Thu Jun 25 16:27:03 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it, the spirit of my past art teacher just flowed through me there for a second. I channeled what she probably would have said.  She always pushed us to have a fuller range of values. It's a problem I have too, trying to get a full range of light lights and dark darks."
ArtBuddy,3b0r1o,CaptainMcLeod,2,Thu Jun 25 01:16:30 2015 UTC,"Not bad! You might want to try turning those lines more towards the cheeks, which i'm assuming is what you want to do with them, but as they are currently they look more like age lines, which I believe is detracting from the cute look you're trying to go for. Try for curves around the cheek area instead and I think you'll like the change."
ArtBuddy,3ayf3z,Slylies,2,Wed Jun 24 14:34:46 2015 UTC,"Based on your current work and your ultimate goal, you may want to check out /r/ArtFundamentals.

ArtBuddy,3au351,Solsed,2,Sat Jun 27 17:29:38 2015 UTC,"Love the look. The lighting is a bit odd though. It seems to be coming from a different direction on every object. Kind of like a composited image. I particularily noticed it on the gold fish. A lot of their light sources seem to be coming from somewhere behind the viewer, but their shadows are from above."
ArtBuddy,3au351,sixilli,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:47:04 2015 UTC,Glad you like it and thank you for the crit! Lighting is one of my weaker sides and I am planning on doing light studies soon to get better. Your comment helps!
ArtBuddy,3au351,Tomly,2,Tue Jun 23 21:58:13 2015 UTC,For the critique on lighting I'm going to assume the light is heavily coming from the top.  For starters the hair was very under worked in terms of lights and darks. For how violent the highlights are on everything else I feel like it's a safe idea to bring them out on the hair. Black hair is very annoying to do because subtly is everything. The lower chest of the figure could be toned done a bit value wise to indicate more form.  The big fish on the left isn't shaded correctly assuming the light is coming from above. I also think the top left shouldn't vignette like it is. For underwater pictures everything tends to be the same shade and only depth changes the value.  The face also needs some work in terms of shading. You could add some shadows around the hair to indicate the lighting from above. Around the eyes it would help to darken up underneath the eyebrow closest to the nose. In this sort of lighting there tends to be a lot of contrast around that area. The hair also in general isn't portrayed accurately underwater. I would say going the whole way to make it look like that or keep it uniform as if the water isn't having any effect on her hair.  Lighting is extremely difficult for a piece like this underwater and I think you did a good job. When it doubt search for reference!
ArtBuddy,3au351,Tomly,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:46:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much, lighting is one of my weaker spots and something I am looking to improving. Your crit helps a lot! :)"

ArtBuddy,3arzra,Timbo_Slice777,3,Tue Jun 23 01:08:48 2015 UTC,"Well, it's rather fuzzy. You might want to try using a brush with less blur to reduce the ambiguity from the get-go. Block in more defined shapes of color and lighting and then refine them with softer brushes. I'm not an experienced painter, though, so a grain of salt may be needed :P"
ArtBuddy,3arzra,Odd_S,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:33:11 2015 UTC,"It looks like you're using a soft brush. For areas that are your focal point, you'll want to use a harder edged brush to bring in the focus of the image. Also, there is too much black in your piece. This makes the image more flat and lose a lot of three-dimensionality."

If I were to give any critique, it would be to make the water a little softer looking. It looks really solid and a little jarring against the relative softness of the sky."

ArtBuddy,3af1pm,Tinyclayforest,7,Fri Jun 19 16:31:27 2015 UTC,"It's a good looking picture, but with the way you composed the values it's a picture about the leg. It's the brightest object against the darkest background, it stands out the most, making it the main focal point of the painting. There is not much that is special about that leg to defend this choice - perhaps if it was more bird-like, not human, it would make more sense? But as it is now, I'd try push it back a little and bring forward the face/wings, since I feel THESE should be the main characters in this picture :)   The face looks excellent drawing-wise! I understand that it's in the shadow, but I think it can stand quite a bit of brightening up to lead the eye to it a better :)   And I agree with what the other poster said, I think the knee should be a bit higher up - it will make the legs look more slender and graceful with these proportions.   Other than that -- beautiful characters, very cool colors! I like how those branches on the ground are composed to keep the eye looking at the piece. Good job :)"
ArtBuddy,3af1pm,donnieT,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:13:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I will certainly make changes in those directions. :D  Originally, the face and wings were brighter, but I always second guess my values. I guess I should be a bit more confident in that area. :/"
ArtBuddy,3af1pm,PotatoPC,4,Fri Jun 19 18:21:04 2015 UTC,Really dig the lighting at the bottom but something doesn't feel right about the composition. Mainly focusing on the area above the wings and towards the head area. Also your character seems to have an abnormally long torso if we use the legs as reference.
ArtBuddy,3af1pm,Vordefiniert,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:02:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input! I'll have to rework it some.  As for part of the composition. Is it possibly the branches?
