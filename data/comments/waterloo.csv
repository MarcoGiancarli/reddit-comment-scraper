waterloo,3e0ayi,squeegeeboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:54:17 2015 UTC,"When you keep saying ""turnaround"" for 3-4 years, it feels like you're chasing your tail.   This has been a long painful downward spiral for everyone involved. I feel bad for those who have stuck through it with that dark cloud always over their shoulder. It's fine for a bachelor I suppose, but not for anyone with a family to worry about."
waterloo,3e0ayi,sonofamitch10,3,Tue Jul 21 03:50:15 2015 UTC,The initial culling is done for.  This is just your normal attrition.  It's only because it's BlackBerry does it get any press.
waterloo,3e0ayi,squeegeeboy,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:28:15 2015 UTC,"""Normal attrition""? It's only normal when a company doesn't have clear direction and strong leadership.   I also wouldn't say that having to shrink your workforce to 1/4 it's size is normal attrition either. They're not just ""trimming the fat"" getting rid of people who aren't performing, they're flying a plane stripping the parts off the inside and seeing how long they can stay aloft.   Of course it gets news because it's BlackBerry. They've been using the word ""turnaround"" as long as the Edmonton Oilers have been in a ""rebuild"".   I have quite a few friends who have been working there for over 5 years and the fear of losing their job is still constant. BlackBerry  pays above average (in many cases) for the area so they stay and deal with it. All I'm saying is it sucks for those still dealing with that constant dark cloud waiting to take the plane down."
waterloo,3e0ayi,sonofamitch10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:13:25 2015 UTC,"Just a month ago John Chen said they were half way through his turnaround plan.  He's been part of BlackBerry since November of 2013... that's 2 years this winter... not 3-4 years.  When speaking of turnaround, we're talking about the turnaround John Chen is promising not the past actions or plans of previous people in that position.  This is going to how Chen has planned it out, and more layoffs could still come down the road."
waterloo,3e0ayi,ILikeStyx,0,Tue Jul 21 17:21:12 2015 UTC,we're talking about the turnaround John Chen is promising   Who's we?   I was talking about those who have been there longer than John Chen. I was referring to the dark cloud that has been there for the people not making millions of dollars regardless of the company's success.    more layoffs could still come down the road.   could?
waterloo,3e0ayi,sonofamitch10,0,Tue Jul 21 18:54:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry..  ""we"" as in generally should be talking about John Chen and his turnaround, anything before that is someone's vision which is no longer happening.  If you're going to talk about BlackBerry and the future, it's with John Chen leading, the past is the past.  Anyone who is still there is either committed to the company and willing to take the risk, or a complete idiot for not looking around for something new.  How terrible is it for someone to sit around with despair hanging over them and yet they take no action?  Come on, they're grown ups.  If they're so worried about job security they can leave.  Of the dozens of people I've known (and know) who have worked there over the past 15 years, anyone recently was either willing to risk the chance of layoff with a severence package, or they went off to greener pastures before anything happened.  I've not heard of many who are walking into work every day depressed out of their minds wondering if 'today is the day' they lose their job.  I feel really sad for anyone who's like that...  You're not stuck working at BB until they shitcan you."

waterloo,3dn33a,jarude87,6,Fri Jul 17 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"The area around Fisher-Hallman and Activa is popular for first time homes in your price range. Mostly townhomes, though you might be able to find a semi at the top of your range.   Generally prices go (from highest to lowest): Waterloo, Kitchener, Cambridge.  Taxes are higher in Waterloo as well.   If you are a first time buyer you should talk to a real estate agent."
waterloo,3dn33a,IUseRhetoric,7,Fri Jul 17 17:00:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know why this myth persists, maybe because land values are just higher in Waterloo? Waterloo has the lowest rate of the three cities. Waterloo city RT rate: 0.349805% Kitchener city RT rate: 0.37488% Cambridge city RT rate: 0.42658% All three are in addition to the regional rate of 0.61489%  Comparatively, london is: 1.171710%, so even that is higher than Cambridge, at 1.04147% once you combine it for a reasonable comparison."
waterloo,3dn33a,qedi,5,Fri Jul 17 18:56:15 2015 UTC,You shouldn't compare percentages because this isn't how towns set their tax rates. Houses in Waterloo are worth more than houses in Kitchener so a lower tax rate still results in higher property taxes.
waterloo,3dn33a,Loovian,3,Sat Jul 18 01:40:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, but when buying a house only actually knowing the rate is how you will be able to directly compare property taxes for two places in different jurisdictions.  Edit: for snark."

waterloo,3dn33a,BigBonzo,6,Mon Jul 20 20:44:37 2015 UTC,"I just moved form Cambridge to Waterloo. Galt, where I was living, you need to be careful.   Near the downtown area there are a few sketchy places. The bus station will always be a collection of interesting people. Beverly Street and the areas around it have a mild amount of drug activity and there is also a soup kitchen there. I lived in the area for a while and it was common to catch homeless or other types rooting though my mailbox or trying the door handles on my car. Happened so much that I had to have all my mail forwarded to my office.   West Galt is almost a ghost town and the city seems to have zero interest in doing anything about it. Stopher park is ok but I'd stay out of there at night.   The downtown has incredible architecture but with all the current construction, getting to and from KW from Cambridge is horrible.   Preston isn't bad as long as you stay off of King St. The houses there are bigger and cheaper but be prepared to do some work (new electric, roof, etc.)   Hespeler isn't a bad option but if you don't like cookie cutter houses then stay away.   For 250, you could get something in the Galt area but you are going to get something small or something that needs a handyman's touch.   As far as taxes in KW, it depends on where you live. You buy something just off Westmount around the KW border, you will pay more in taxes.   I bought a house in Waterloo (near UW) that is bigger, and more expensive than the one I had in Cambridge and my taxes are a few hundred bucks a year cheaper.    Personally, I'd just try and save for a down payment and stay in Waterloo until you can find something you like."

K-W-C is WAYYY to expensive for what it is, however it is a great town with everything you need a few minutes away.  north-west waterloo (boardwalk area) is nice its new but 2 things to note: 1 there is a garbage dump near the boardwalk and when they burn the garbage there is a bad smell, you can smell it and its uncomfortable you will get used to it but i wont bother buying anything near there (http://www.therecord.com/news-story/2595283-suburban-dump-sours-some-noses/)  As well waterloo is overpriced (for it being in the same geography as kitchener/cambridge) however it does have a nice curb appeal it also has alot more rules in place, in waterloo you cannot have a fire pit, parking on streets are strict, taxes are higher in waterloo as opposed to kitchener. You can tell the difference (generally speaking) between kitchener and waterloo by driving through them   cambridge is a manufacturing town primarily and it has some nice areas like in galt (but i believe it is a little pricy); but stay away from preston i dont know enough about cambridge though.  For the price that you are looking for you can find a nice place in kitchener in a nice neighborhood"
waterloo,3dn33a,learn2swim,7,Fri Jul 17 16:58:59 2015 UTC,"Garbage isn't burned at the Waterloo landfill, just buried to rot. But yes it stinks, there's a mountain bike trail that runs along the dump called ""stinky girl"" for that reason.   Housing is disgustingly expensive in KW, however, there are a lot of properties which go for around the 250k price mark, you just have to watch very closely and move very fast, because the cheaper properties are scooped up extremely fast."
waterloo,3dn33a,shellderp,2,Sat Jul 18 13:01:48 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much how I feel so far. No offense to the fine citizens of the area, but seeing no real discernible difference between London and KW and yet having the real estate costs be 150% more for no apparent reason other than being 1 hour closer to Toronto is curious.  I also hear you on the Boardwalk smell - it's definitely noticeable. And on the parking strictness, as I found out the hard way.   I appreciate the heads up. Thanks for the info."
waterloo,3dn33a,mpd618,11,Fri Jul 17 20:23:45 2015 UTC,being 1 hour closer to Toronto   There's your answer.
waterloo,3dn33a,shiftee_uk,5,Fri Jul 17 20:40:54 2015 UTC,"^ This. KW has its charm, but it's also home to a lot of Toronto commuters. Driving the 401 east from London in the morning, you don't really hit any traffic until you hit KW."
waterloo,3dn33a,deanomac,4,Fri Jul 17 23:49:01 2015 UTC,It's hard to believe people actually commute from KW to Toronto. 3-4 hours a day of commuting would make me want to kill myself.
waterloo,3dn33a,Anomander,3,Sun Jul 19 23:58:18 2015 UTC,"Cambridge is closer to Toronto and home to more GTA commuters, but my impression is Kitchener-Waterloo real estate is more expensive. So I don't think it's just about distance to Toronto."
waterloo,3dn33a,qedi,7,Sat Jul 18 00:30:06 2015 UTC,"This is true but Cambridge is only really one or two exits closer.  The other primary cause is that Kitchener-Waterloo is home to two Universities and one College, as well as being a rather substantial tech hub with companies like Google, EA and others having offices here."
waterloo,3dn33a,s6xspeed,3,Sat Jul 18 00:32:56 2015 UTC,"In reality it is a couple of stops closer, and a flyover and hwy 8 (which isn't as bad as it has been before) and than hwy 85 and the flyover there and the 10/15 minutes to get to hwy 85.  From living in Waterloo before, it is another 30 minutes during rush hour to get to toronto."
waterloo,3dn33a,thefringthing,4,Sat Jul 18 22:51:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's mostly that once you're commuting from KWC, the few minutes saved by starting from Cambridge rather than KW are kinda a negligible concern compared to more immediate access to ""better"" things close by to where you live.   Cambridge will probably end up the more valuable locale long run, but the town itself needs more growth before it competes on ""what's local to me"" with Kitchener or Waterloo."
waterloo,3dn33a,thoughtsy,6,Sat Jul 18 02:47:07 2015 UTC,Might just be the way of the commuter - Guelph is more expensive than KW by another 30% or so.
waterloo,3dn33a,thefringthing,2,Fri Jul 17 20:49:04 2015 UTC,yeah dont get me wrong though kw is a very nice city too bad its overpriced
waterloo,3dn33a,s6xspeed,3,Fri Jul 17 21:33:55 2015 UTC,It's not about what's here now but what people are expecting. KW is growing fast.
waterloo,3dn33a,Samanthangel,2,Fri Jul 17 23:01:33 2015 UTC,"Actually, we're not. Even our university enrollment is down this year. There's just a lot of expectation of growth that might prove unrealistic as time goes by. Ontario has lost it's edge."
waterloo,3dn33a,Foodwraith,3,Sat Jul 18 11:33:16 2015 UTC,Depends what kind of growth you're measuring. We're building all sorts of stuff.

waterloo,3dn33a,thoughtsy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:08:04 2015 UTC,No actually you can't find a place in kitchener for that price - that price gets you a town or row house with condo fees that might as well make it a $300 - $320 home. And the location would be out new fairview. KW prices are rediculous
waterloo,3dn33a,Samanthangel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:04:24 2015 UTC,There are lots of other places to get semi-s or towns. I would look in Kitchener just south of where your fiance currently lives. Also have a look at Highland Rd E or the new Victoria Commons in the Guelph Street area.  I would agree with the smell of the dump. I would not live in West Waterloo and I avoid the Boardwalk most of the time due to the smell. It is awful.
waterloo,3dn33a,Loovian,6,Sat Jul 18 13:37:03 2015 UTC,"Preston, Galt, Cambridge prices are much more in your range. You can get detacheds and semis that need a little work for $180 - $220"
waterloo,3dn33a,kwirck,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:03:06 2015 UTC,"The architecture in Galt beats Waterloo hands down. Preston has rows of houses, probably developed in the 1930s-50s.

I am linked on both sides I have around 1500 square feet no condo fees one car garage, room for one in the driveway small open backyard   The bus service out here is not great, but with driving it's fairly conveniently located.

That's where most of the new developments are happening and the prices in Waterloo are more expensive. The bad areas of town are kind of just around downtown. If you're a few blocks away from King Street, you're probably fine.    If you're ok with commuting an extra 10-15 minutes, I'd suggesting looking at New Hamburg. It's a small town not far to the west and has lower prices. Most of the houses there are a bit older, but you can get more for your money."

waterloo,3ddzdh,kimber_whistler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:06:10 2015 UTC,Though I agree a 24 hour urgent care clinic would be useful I really think that most of the issue would be solved by people not going to the ER with issues that obviously should be dealt with by their family doctor. Really these are the people seeing the long wait times. ER with triage patients so if you have something that needs to be looked at within 5 hours you aren't going to wait 5 hours and if you have something that doesn't need to be looked at within 5 hours you probably shouldn't be in the ER.  But yeah if there was a 24 hour Urgent Care clinic and people were educated about its existence and when you should be going there. That would also help as well.

waterloo,3ddzdh,Faranae,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:09:58 2015 UTC,"There's an after hour urgent care clinic on Lancaster that my SO and I opened a week and a bit ago. It isn't 24 hours, but it is purely after hours (mon-Fri 6pm-11pm). Because we're super new our wait times are literally like ten minutes (which will change of course as we get busier, but are still much less than emerg)."
waterloo,3ddzdh,kimber_whistler,2,Mon Jul 20 02:08:36 2015 UTC,"I've been a few times in the last year and while I was admitted quickly the wait for the doctor was really long, about 5 hours. I don't get why they can't just bring in an extra doctor or two for the ER, it seemed like there was one doctor for the entire ER.  It would definitely help to have an ""inbetween"" clinic that's not quite an ER but available at any time and can do basic blood tests / prescribe medicine."
waterloo,3ddzdh,shellderp,3,Thu Jul 16 04:58:18 2015 UTC,Especially because many of us don't have family doctors or local family doctors. Mine is in Guelph as I was not able to find one when I moved here in 2008 - was on list for 3 years until they suggested someone who was currently under review by College of Physicians.  This isn't really someone I would want in charge of my medical care.  Ideally your doctor should be your choice and someone you are comfortable with (esp if gay or lesbian) -- it's hard to get that here when you are lucky to get any doctor at all.

You'll find a lot of Canadian Tire and Walmart brands in varying conditions.  I've regularly seen rusty old broken bikes sell for more than they would cost brand new at Canadian Tire. People go for the thrill of bidding at auction - not to score a deal. Value just isn't there.  They usually keep the better condition, more valuable bikes till last. And they auction them off in order. So usually if you want a good bike, plan on sticking around until noon or so."

What a way to misrepresent the article.  The most relevant part is the ""Economic Security"" portion of the entry for KWC:   Employment levels are significantly higher than average in Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo, but so is the gap in women’s and men’s representation in the workforce, with 72% of men working compared to 64% of women. The city has one of the larger wage gaps of the 25 cities measured: women make 66% of what men make overall. That gap closes only slightly for full-time workers, with women earning 69% of what men bring home working full time. Women’s poverty rates are higher than average in Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo and the gap in men’s and women’s levels of poverty is larger than average, with 11% of men and 16.5% of women living below the Low Income Measure.   Unless I missed something, that 66% is a raw general figure. Now consider that Waterloo has plenty of opportunities for high-paying jobs such as programming in a startup. I can tell you that the male-to-female ratio in UW's Software Engineering program, something expected to produce employees for these jobs, is extremely high. It's a no-brainer that women would make much lower overall."

I wouldn't say it's impossible to make close friends, just difficult. There is plenty going on in the region to get involved with where you can make friends (rec sports, festivals, running groups, etc) so it just depends how much effort you want them put into it. The cost of living is more but wages are higher. The city is growing so it could end up being a good thing to get in now before it blows up and isn't feasible to move here (like Toronto).

Every other week, 1 bag/can of garbage to a max of 50lbs, more than that you pay for a ""garbage bag tag"", it's $2, but it may be different now.  Recycling and green bin pickup is done every week.  You can have as much green bin, and recycling as you wish at no additional cost.  The garbage collectors enforce it too, they stick a ""you have too much"" sticker on your extra garbage without a tag."

The only reason to pull CAT6 is to eventually move beyond 1GbE bandwidth, and unless you're moving massive amounts of data on your home network (and have the equipment to enable that), you'll never use it to capacity. You can run over a dozen 4K streams on a standard gigabit network and still leave enough bandwidth for virtually anything else you'd like to do."

Plus you have Kitchener too which has far fewer students.   Coming from Toronto, will I go crazy from isolation/boredom? Be honest and provide examples.   Guess that depends what you like to do.

waterloo,3cc1us,assstastic,11,Tue Jul 7 16:14:51 2015 UTC,"I believe that Waterloo has outgrown the idea of being a university town. There are close to half a million people living here, with 53,060 students from UW and WLU. There are enough restaurants, parks, points of interest, and more to outshine the student population. Plus, if you typically come home from a restaurant or bar before 10pm, you probably won't run into them anyway. As /u/TwistedEdge says, they are also localized because they typically don't have transportation.  There are a great many young professionals. Beyond BlackBerry, there are offices here for SunLife, ManuLife, Google, SAP, Kik Messenger, and a multitude of very exciting startups and both satellite and head offices for Canadian and international businesses. Stats Canada census data shows more citizens over 25 than under. Those between 25 and 35 are double the amount between 20 and 24. The median age is 37.6, which is younger than the median for Ontario and Canada. Also, 28% of the population is listed as ""single"".  It's crazy bigger than Guelph, but it's still small enough that you can learn to know almost every part of it very well. Guelph has 114,940 (2006), whereas Waterloo has 98,780, Kitchener 219,153, and Cambridge 126,748 (2011). So about 4x the population (or 444,681) in the tri-cities compared to Guelph. In terms of other cities with similar sizes, think London, Hamilton, Halifax, or Niagara.    My least favorite thing? People seem to drive everywhere and it's a very vehicle heavy city, due to the relatively wealthy population and lack of a compact central core (although Kitchener does have this).   My favorite thing? The food and drink scene has really exploded recently, and we have some amazing chefs that have settled into the region who are taking advantage of the incredible local meat and produce industries - not to mention the craft beer/music/international/busker/open streets/BBQ festivals.

I love it here.  I like the quiet, the ability to bike everywhere, the stars at night, the park lands, great access to the country, St. Jacobs market.  It's become a place for me to raise a family.  The downsides, for both my wife (30 years a Toronto girl) and I are:   Lack of ethnic foods and diversity (no Hakka food, no chili chicken :( ) Lack of things to do - certainly not the variety of Toronto Lack of parks/ splash pads/museums .. kid stuff   We often find ourselves going to Toronto for things to do on weekends .. things like festivals, shopping, good grocery stores.  But, if you do it on weekends, getting into the core of downtown isn't horrible.  And if you have to go back during the week, the GO train is pretty reasonable.  The quality of life makes up for all the shortcomings - I can drive to work in 6 minutes, in traffic.  I can ride to work in 15 minutes.  These things mean I have more time for myself, my family, my friends.  I live 15 minutes from pretty much everything I could need, and I don't live in my car.  Anyhow, my $0.02."

Every place worth judging offers these simple yet, hard to master items.  about parks... i love victoria park.  i love it more than any park i've been to in the GTA.

However, have you looked into job opportunities for your field in KW already?  TO has a lot more opportunities in nearly all areas, and the 'tech fields' competition here is likely higher (vs demand)."
waterloo,3cc1us,Darkassault2011,2,Mon Jul 6 21:45:52 2015 UTC,"My apologies, I should have clarified.  I'm looking to stay within the university system, so Waterloo was an obvious candidate (WU, WLU, UoG, etc.). Although these discussions are certainly premature, I do feel that I could secure a position at one of these institutions based on my qualifications/experience. Naturally, I would first secure the new position, then begin the grand move.   The motivation for moving isn't employment; I actually enjoy my current job quite a bit. I want to relocate because I just can't afford to set roots in Toronto, and I don't want a long commute. Even if I got the best job in the world, it still wouldn't be enough to afford a home in Toronto.   If I do relocate to Waterloo, I'm expecting a lateral move with marginally fewer benefits/pension, so I'm under no illusions. My only hope is that advancement opportunities exist with so many post-secondary institutions nearby.   If I could take my current job and the people with me, I would. Most of them."

We have a couple universities with Laurier being the major party school, so I'm told (University/King).  There are quite a few events going on every week in the city, depending on what you're in to.  Having lived here my whole life (so far), I would say I am quite satisfied with the KW area. One thing I would say is to avoid living near Paulander, because it's quite a bad neighbourhood (My cousin lived there for about 4 years)."

I work at UW and live close by the campus and reasonably close to uptown.  I am friends with young professionals, older professionals and students.  If you're willing to go out places, there are many different things to do and lots of people to meet but you have to appreciate it's not like Toronto or any of its suburbs in terms of density.  Waterloo has Wilfrid Laurier and University of Waterloo, almost 55,000 students total.  The population of Waterloo is 98,000 permanent residents.  If you already work for a university then Laurier and UW are always hiring; https://uwaterloo.ca/my-career/external-opportunities  Houses... Kitchener they can start in the low 200's while Waterloo is usually closer to 200K+  It really depends where in the city you want to live.

I will be moving to Ottawa in the Fall (Master's) and am excited for the change. I also grew up in Mississauga suburbia so I really liked Waterloo at first but for some of the reasons that I will mention it has lost its charm.    Is Waterloo a university town? I loved Guelph, but even as a student, I could only put up with so many drunken 19 year olds…   Yes yes yes, if you want to go clubbing you will no doubt see many people younger than you. Generally Starlight has an older crowd, Night School can be a mix and same with Beta. If you just go exclusively to bars there are more options and can be more varied in age but this is a pretty big university town with two schools here.   Coming from Toronto, will I go crazy from isolation/boredom? Be honest and provide examples.   There are a fair amount of things to do in Waterloo especially if you have a car. There's Laurel Creek which is nice, has a little beach, Toronto isn't too far, a fair amount of parks and lakes. There's St. Jacob's market if you like farmers markets. Housing is also affordable here.   Are there many young professionals in Waterloo (25-35)? Are any of them attractive, single women? Please say yes.   I don't know much personally, Laurier doesn't have too many strong Master's program and those that they do have are pretty small. UW has more Master's program but can be varied demographics.. Waterloo does have a lot of big names here/startups, even some head offices, so there definitely are women in that age group and everything but most likely will have to do more digging than in Toronto.   Personally, as someone looking for young professional men it has been pretty difficult :P but maybe finding women will be easier?   Does Waterloo feel considerably bigger than Guelph, or is it comparable in perceived size? How would you compare it to Guelph, since I’m familiar with that town?   I think Waterloo is much more compact than Guelph in the sense that it is easy to get around to the main areas quickly and that is where most of the action goes down."

If we become swamped throughout the week, the weekends will definitely be added to the hours. We don't have any plans to offer day-time hours, however. There's a lot of day-time walk in and urgent care clinics as is, and we'd prefer to cater to the patients who require after-hours care.  Re: Your second question: For someone who comes in late requiring extensive medical attention, we'd do everything we could for them to save time at the hospital (where in the example you gave, they would definitely need to end up). They'd leave with x-Ray requisitions and any referrals for anyone else they'd have to see (say a surgeon or something). If it was just a fracture, we could handle that though and at least stabilize the patient so they don't have to wait 6+ hours in emerg to get the same referrals."

Also, brave St. Jacobs Market, lots of stuff to checkout, buy, and eat there (don't miss out on the pizza or apple fritters, they're delicious).

You could go to Toronto Island, or visit high park.  Niagara Falls us fairly obvious. I have heard really great things about the copa cabana Brazilian BBQ place there.. been trying do years to get a weekend to go check it out.  Loads of world class wineries to explore as well.

waterloo,3c0rg2,rspdr,7,Fri Jul 3 18:40:40 2015 UTC,Wind is okay at best. The reception in buildings is almost non existent and when I was in Waterloo (last August) my friends would drop calls or not have signal outside.  Virgin mobile and Koodo have some decent plans but the data allowance is quite small. Either prepare to pay a lot for the 5GB or you need or change your surfing habits.   Welcome to Canada and our atrocious cellphone plans :)

waterloo,3c0rg2,sephiriad,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:52:24 2015 UTC,I've had wind since february and I haven't had any major problems. It is worth saving $60-70 (what they quoted me at bell to get a new phone and new plan) to have a few shitty areas of coverage.

waterloo,3c0rg2,stephiej17,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:09:56 2015 UTC,"Holy crap is the cost worth it. I'm grandfathered into the plan they had when they first came into the city. Less than 30 bucks for unlimited everything. Unfortunately said everything doesn't include roaming...  In the past two months I've had ""roaming"" data charges while in the oddest of places: the Kitchener City Hall area, and the Fairview Mall area (also in Kitchener). I've managed to get the charges removed thanks to google's tracking at https://maps.google.com/locationhistory since it shows ""yeah, at X time I was located smack dab in the middle of one of the most covered areas of the city"".  This would be far less frustrating if the guys at the Wind kiosks could actually help with issues instead of calling the help line every time."

As I saw all Kitchener and waterloo covered in WIND coverage map I thought reception would be OK while in city, but looks like I was wrong :(  There's no point in having a lot of data if I can't use it all the time.   Thanks for pointing me to virgin mobile. The 55$/mo plan seems OK. Unlimited everything with 3gb of data in 4G speeds. I can live with that. So virgin reception is a lot better than WIND?"

Also they claim to have unlimited data, but in reality you only get two hours of priority internet (decent speed) a day, and the rest is just dial up    I'm aware that in the states they have something like 5GB+ Plans but here I'm sure at best you'll be paying a shit ton of money for only 3gb max iirc.   Stay away from bell and rogers since they tend to add lots of random charges and their customer service is a hassle to get through.

Margret can take you all the way to university which has bike lanes. north of bridge port theres no bike lanes on Margret but its a low traffic neighborhood in that area (again school zone, bluevale is close by there). As well king street generally is more comfortable to ride up as traffic doesn't tend to travel faster than 35-40, so assuming you can maintain a 20km/h at a minimum its quite comfortable.

waterloo,3buzg0,mpd618,3,Fri Jul 3 03:48:07 2015 UTC,We're talking about a corridor where they just expropriated and demolished the houses on one side of the street in order to add more lanes. The amount they would have needed for bike infrastructure would not have been large compared to that.
waterloo,3buzg0,scriptedfate,2,Fri Jul 3 04:47:29 2015 UTC,"Back in 2004, the Region adopted a Cycling Master Plan that was not particularly ambitious and did not include Weber Street as an important cycling route. This is a bit self-reinforcing, as little interest in biking on a very hostile street like Weber doesn't mean there isn't demand for travel by bike in that corridor.  The plan was in effect when the Weber Street widening project started, around 2008. The project had a lot to do with providing ""replacement"" lanes and an alternative corridor to King Street given the reduction due to LRT and the construction. Bike lanes were just never on the agenda given their absence from the Cycling Master Plan. And neither does the current Active Transportation Master Plan mark Weber Street as being an important corridor for cycling.  The Region of Waterloo has shown interest in adding cycling infrastructure where it's relatively easy - and has been doing so pretty routinely in road reconstructions. But in some places the road is busy and the corridor is relatively constrained - and they have not been willing to add cycling infrastructure in those cases.  And there is some political wisdom for the government to choose their battles, so as not to have big battles with the angry, entitled driving public poison the well for the incremental addition of cycling infrastructure throughout the region.  Though examples like the protected bike lanes approved for King Street between Erb and University may change this calculus. I hope."

And be very vigilant over calories in smoothies.  Shove in a banana and some peanut butter and you can easily get a 500 calorie drink that won't help anyone lose weight."
waterloo,3brbqn,canadianviking,2,Wed Jul 1 21:34:38 2015 UTC,"this is a good point. real food has real protein, with all the complexities that real things come with. isolated protein is useful for a top-up maybe, but even at its best it can't replace the real thing.  with all that said, check out supplementsource.ca  their prices are incredible even compared to costco and walmart. you need to crack about $100 for free shipping but it's completely worth it.   the only problem is their site is complete chaos and a lot of the stuff they sell has all sorts of extra hokum in it that bodybuilders go crazy over.  my personal favourite is kaizen whey protein which is really pure and has very few extra ingredients. they also have a really good price on north coast naturals hemp protein.  anyway those are good starting places. if you've got any questions PM me"

I been getting it mostly from real sources, but usually it comes along with a lot of fat unless you like eating skinless chicken breast or tuna all day. Meat is also pretty expensive.  So I use protein powder for about 50grams of the protein (~2 scoops) with rest coming from real food."

Peanut butter and wonder bread together contain all essential amino acids.  It's trivial to get protein.  These supplements are a scam.
waterloo,3brbqn,harmar21,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:13:49 2015 UTC,"Nuts -- very high in calories 100 grams of almonds = 550 calories and only 21g of protein. 200g of rice 220 calories and only 2.5g of protein.

waterloo,3brbqn,cupoftequila,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:54:50 2015 UTC,"I would suggest you go straight to Health Foods & More near Bridgeport & Devitt (across from the Walmart/Sobeys plaza). They have a great selection of high quality protein powders and the best prices by far, and they are SO knowledgeable.  And I say ""best prices"" as in best prices for the quality you are buying. You could easily go to Walmart and pick up something cheaper but you mentioned you are on a health kick so I assume you want to put good things in your body! Cheap protein powder = cheap ingredients that are hard on your system.  A great ""beginner"" protein is Vega One. Clean ingredients and tastes great. Once you get used to the taste of protein powders, you might want to graduate to something even cleaner. My absolute favourite is Garden of Life Raw Protein in Vanilla Whisper but some people find it too earthy tasting. You can buy small sample packs for a few dollars if you want to try a bunch of different ones before you commit to a tub.  I'll also suggest 2 of my favourite smoothie recipes since you mentioned you weren't sure what to include. I usually only use half a scoop of protein powder so I can also add a real food protein too (non fat plain greek yogurt is my favourite - cottage cheese works too). I never measure ingredients so this is my best guess at what goes into my blender, so add more water or almond milk if it's too thick!  Green smoothie: 1 small banana 1/2 scoop vanilla protein powder 2 spoonfuls nonfat greek yogurt 1/2 cup water (or unsweetened almond milk) 1/2 avocado 1/2 an orange (for added sweetness--optional!) 3 packed handfuls of baby spinach A few ice cubes  Pumpkin pie smoothie (ya it tastes just like dessert!): 1 small banana 1/2 scoop vanilla protein powder 2 spoonfuls nonfat greek yogurt 1/2 cup pure canned pumpkin (found in the baking aisle--NOT pumpkin pie filling!!) 1/2 cup water (or unsweetened almond milk) 1 tbsp natural unsweetened peanut or almond butter (look for only nuts on the label) 2 tsp cinnamon (I also add ground cloves and nutmeg sometimes) A few ice cubes"
waterloo,3brbqn,perouze,4,Thu Jul 2 01:39:24 2015 UTC,"P.S. Technically, your wife's goal should also be to gain muscle. A lot of women wanting to lose weight focus too much on cutting calories and doing cardio (either because they think that is the most effective way or because they're afraid of bulking up). Lifting weights to gain muscle is a really really important part of effective and lasting weight loss. Muscle burns fat and increases your metabolism. And she shouldn't worry about getting bulky--that takes women years of intentional hard work and a very specific diet. This article is a good starting point for reading: http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/buffmother2.htm. PM me if you have any questions or want to talk further!"
waterloo,3brbqn,cupoftequila,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:54:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yes, I have heard that building muscle cuts more calories than anything. She is a bit more nervous about weights so I might save up some money on my next couple paychecks and get her a private appt or two at the gym. I'm not exactly sure on a lot of stuff either so it's hard for me to help!  We go to HF&M a fair bit anyways as she is celiac, and we love that store! I forgot they had all the supplements and stuff. My only worry is that we would buy something that would have too many extras - I don't want to say ""duped"" because the staff are amazing but we're really going in blind for the most part.  Thanks for the advice. Might IM you later for questions once we start it up!"
waterloo,3brbqn,perouze,0,Thu Jul 2 14:37:16 2015 UTC,"I understand the hesitation on weights! I'd be happy to point her in the direction of a few good beginner books that explain everything really well and provide weight training plans that aren't complicated or intimidating. I'm not sure 1-2 private training sessions will be worth your while--a lot of the value of private training comes from the accountability of the regular appts and you don't learn everything you need to know in the first couple. But it certainly wouldn't hurt. If she's a GoodLife member I'd be happy to show her around the weight room sometime.   As for proteins and your concern about too many extras, you're safe with Garden of Life Raw Protein, Sun Warrior, and Vega One (in that order in terms of value!)"

waterloo,3bnrs6,youbrainislying,2,Wed Jul 1 00:49:14 2015 UTC,The owner took that tone as soon as he started communicating with us a year ago (before it was just his brother who we dealt with). ...I have an audio recording of him threatening us with his corporate lawyers if anyone would like me to post that too. It's in the same tone
waterloo,3bnrs6,youbrainislying,6,Wed Jul 1 03:39:22 2015 UTC,"If you read the content of the email in its entirety, the owner is openly stating / gloating that all he wanted to do was drag out court proceedings and make the plaintiffs expend as much energy as possible to recover their money.  Maybe the OP is less than a perfect individual, maybe not, but regardless, a grudge is not an excuse to spend a year leveraging your deeper pockets to make someone else's life difficult via the court system, simply because OP had the temerity to ask someone to Please Not Steal Their Money. It doesn't matter who started with the uncivil talk here, when someone is stealing your money you are not required to suck up to them and make nice as part of the deal in recovering it.  So in summary: We've got a business owner who clearly was unintelligent enough to author a letter like this and stamp it with their company logo, a court decision in favour of the OP backing up the accusation that the owner is a scumbag, and a letter wherein the accused-scumbag openly gloats about wasting a ""nerds"" time to get their money back? And your concern here is that the OP somehow did something to deserve this?"
waterloo,3bnrs6,holypiefatman,3,Wed Jul 1 15:26:04 2015 UTC,"Well, public records show it's a ""company"" of two people, and the purported author of the above email is the owner of the business. While I don't agree with ""review bombing"" as a justifiable go-to response for everything any company somewhere ever does (Nor have I taken part in it), given in this case the company literally is the individual, it's at least debatable to say there's no difference between publicly shaming the individual vs the company. It is not as though the author had concerns with appending the name of his own business to his letter.  Even setting aside the diction of the letter and looking only at the presented information, is it inherently wrong for someone to make public some information about the actions of a business owner and landlord to the community in which that person lives and operates? This subreddit is full of people discussing which local companies (and by extension, individuals) can be trusted and which should be avoided. This isn't a right to privacy violation, OP didn't record this man muttering to himself in the shower. This wasn't a personal dispute in which someone's dog pooped on the neighbors lawn, this is the story of a predatory landlord: a self-avowed vindictive individual who treats people with disdain.  Naturally all of the above is predicated on the notion that the OP is not lying through his teeth about the base facts of the situation, which remains a possibility, but seems unlikely. Court records are public, libel is actionable, and so on. One would presume that if the business owner is somehow free of wrongdoing, he could simply release the entire email chain as well if he so chose.   I can't see how any of this really justifies the tone you have been taking here though. Being provoked by a landlord illegally withholding your money and spitefully forcing you to battle through the legal system to get it back, and then ultimately laughing in your face about it, is not being ""butthurt"". It is not being a ""pussy"" to not have a 3 year old Reddit account kicking around with which to post information (Information which, by the way, easily makes the OP identifiable). Perhaps you are fortunate enough to be in a position where you could lose the equivalent of a few months rent and not suffer overmuch, but that may not be true for everyone."

When you pull into the parking lot look for their trucks. They are white pick ups with the logo. I go tons with my dog and have only seen them a couple times and always got my leash on before they could catch me.

waterloo,3apv1s,robdrimmie,3,Mon Jun 22 15:22:50 2015 UTC,"Communitech is a not-for-profit, but we have a fantastic web developer on staff. We also have a full-time IT person, data and reporting specialist, and a director of technical strategy (<- me). Most not-for-profits are unable to afford a full-time web developer unless their core product or service is technical, which few are. Communitech is relatively large (about 80 folks give or take) and well-funded.  At this time we're not looking to add more technical roles, though we do often hire co-ops to help with this kind of work.  Peaceworks (as recommended by morty) is a great company. I am pretty sure they are for profit but a social venture and do a lot of great work on a sliding scale for a large number of not-for-profits (they fund some of that through more standard commercial projects).  Consider also looking into social ventures in general, these are for-profit organizations focused on doing good and often have a technical focus. University of Waterloo has an incubator dorm called the St. Paul's Greenhouse, Communitech runs a program for early stage ventures called ASCent and there's a Waterloo Region chapter of Social Venture Partners. Probably lots more, there's increasing focus on support for these organizations in the area.  (edited with slightly more details of technical staff because I re-read the question, and for readability and flow because I can't leave well-enough alone)"

waterloo,3aq2bx,CoryCA,9,Mon Jun 22 16:10:31 2015 UTC,"God, what terrible journalism.   So after politicians approved trains, commercial growth collapsed by more than half near planned train stations. And station areas drew a slightly smaller share of development.   Correlation doesn't imply causation. What factors were controlled for? The author doesn't say.   It may be that development trends have little to do with rail transit, in part because trains are not yet running.    They wrote that whole article and threw together those graphs, and then this. Of course commercial and residential infrastructure isn't being impacted by trains - they're still under construction."
waterloo,3aq2bx,hippiechan,6,Mon Jun 22 17:31:23 2015 UTC,Jeff Outhit's a tool. He has never used public transit in his life and yet he reports on it. And is clearly biased against LRT.

waterloo,3aq2bx,webu,2,Mon Jun 22 17:39:17 2015 UTC,"Of course commercial and residential infrastructure isn't being impacted by trains - they're still under construction.   Agreed, I'd even argue that the construction is causing the opposite to happen (less business along LRT route). LRT = high population density = high traffic to businesses, so there will be businesses that want/expect/need lots of customers. But today, the locations where LRT stops will be are in shambles. It's harder for customers to get there now than ever before, but in the near future it will be easier than ever before. Nobody is dumb enough to open businesses right now, they would be eating losses until the trains are running with no benefit. They couldn't even begin constructing developments without major headaches because there is such restricted access at the moment."

Waterloo is an all day thing at Columbia lake, with some games, food vendors, and music acts, ending with a big fireworks show.  Its fun, but parking can be difficult, and be prepared to wait getting out.  Much better if you can walk there.  I think the headliner this year for Waterloo is Kim Mitchell.  Kitchener is newer, only a few years old.  It's more adult oriented, with a beer tent, and music acts.  This year they have Treble Charger, Hollerado, and Fefe Dobson.  It's also capped off by fireworks, which have been getting better.  It's not kid unfriendly though, and have had no problem bringing our kids, just not a lot specifically for them to do outside the fireworks.  For most, Waterloo is the better event (unless you are a big fan of one of the bands above), but getting in and out can be a hassle, and there are always big crowds.  We started going to Kitchener recently, but that is mostly based on the fact we can walk there."

waterloo,3actoh,shellderp,4,Fri Jun 19 01:50:40 2015 UTC,Lived there for two years.  Hydro ran me around 100 in winter but higher in summer for AC.  Water is hard in all areas of Kitchener-Waterloo but DT Kitchener is especially hard.   King Street side is very noisy due to construction.  I had Rogers cable and it was no different than Rogers cable anywhere else in the region (read: meh)  I was not happy living there as the walls are very thin and there are a lot of partying types and young professionals. I aged out of that bracket (35) and now like it to be silent after midnight so...I moved.  I also hated the lack of indoor parking -- for that price it's a bit ridiculous.

My parents house is probably less than 2,500sq.ft and they use natural gas, their Hydro bill was only slightly higher than mine over the winter.

With all the LRT development happening at that intersection, I wouldn't recommend living there right now. Internet was fine, and the water was as bad as anywhere in KW.   The parking thing can be a bit of an issue as kids from the St. Louis School would sometimes park in my spot. There's nothing you can do unless you want to pay for the tow, which is like $200. You can only call the city and have them ticket the car.  The management kind of sucks. They once let unsupervised workmen into my place, without notifying me, while I was at work one day. Specifically, there's a maintenance/janitorial woman who works there who did this, and when I complained about it to management, they said they wouldn't reprimand her because it would hurt her feelings. Coming home to my dog freaking out and two strangers in my place was blood-boiling to say the least."
waterloo,3actoh,EmmaRN,2,Fri Jun 19 10:30:41 2015 UTC,"I've been living in Kaufman (1 bedroom, ~600sqft) for two years now and I hate it.    Hydro is ~$100 /month. Water is extremely hard. When the water softener is down for maintenance, which can be for a few days, the clothes washer and dish washer will both stain. Within the first few weeks of moving in, they changed a water pipe in the building which seems to have left a blue stain all over my shower tiles, tub (vinyl), and both sinks that no one will fix. Internet speeds are fine, but I had to argue a deal out of Rogers (typical). If you face King St., it's very loud. Obnoxious motorcycles in the summer, snowplows throughout the winter, sirens from every direction. There's drunken idiots that scream non-sense between 12am - 3am every Thursday-Sunday. The thermal insulation from the windows is terrible. Extremely hot in the summer, extremely cold in the winter. The only defence is to leave the blinds closed at all times and have the ac / furnace pumping constantly. I'm not sure if it's just my apartment, but it seems like it's perpetually dusty, as if the ducts need cleaning. I replace the furnace filter once every ~3 months and because it's a one-off size, it must be purchased through the building supervisor. Similarly, my washer/dryer produces an exorbitant amount of lint, which never gets extracted and resides on my clothes.  My Dishwasher also squeals mid-cycle.   Note*: Since anything inside the apartment is on the onus of the tenant, I would have to pay to fix/replace/clean any of the appliances, which have been in this state shortly after moving in.  All of the other comments I've read here are accurate. I've had workers let in my place without permission, lots of other noise from tenants (partying students, screaming babies, etc.), individuals parking in my space and damage to my car from visitors.  The only reason I haven't left is that I can't find anything similar in the same price range (like you). I've (sadly) missed out on a few places in Laurelwood that were a tad more expensive but provided two bedrooms, ~1000sqft, and two parking spots (one underground, one above ground). Bauer is much more expensive, as is Seagram and most of the other ""luxury"" lofts."

Also, I used to work in the detail bay in the back; they do not take care of your paint. You will get scratches.   Wilson's in Guelph is just as bad. I was looking at a VW Passat there and I asked them to drive the car to a local VW dealership for an inspection that I paid for. The inspection determined the car has severe rust and it wasn't recommended. I told the sales rep and he said alright. I assumed everything was okay, but the next time I called to ask about a car, the sales rep talked to me very rudely; telling me I wasted his time by making his staff drive that VW to the dealership and that he doesn't want to sell a car to me.

Also, I always stipulate less then 15KMS on delivery so they don't have you a car that's been demo'ed out. They rotate new cars to demo so they don't need to have a designated demo.   Walked into parkway mazda, asked for xxxx discount. Sales person did the whole check with manager. Waited 20 minutes, manager basically gave me the no can do speech. Walked out got a call the next day saying they can do it. I didn't call back.  Went to kitchener ford. Best they can give me was a $200 off a MSRP fiesta. GTFO outta there without even trying.  Made an offer @ Waterloo Honda, guy laughed at my offer and gave me 600$ off of msrp off a civic + 1 oil change.

He accepted only half of what I was able to talk them into. Anyways, my experience was they used all the excuse/bs/w/e to try to convince you their price is the best you can get without actually budging on their price at all. If your getting a 20-30k car. Civic, mazda3, focus etc. Aim for about $1000 off of all the other promotions they have on. You will get the ""other advertised promotions everywhere you go so that should be your baseline or ""adjusted MSRP"" to start your negotiations. Also try to add in some small freebies in the end, like oil changes. They will likely offer you 1 at the end.   The guy I dealt with at kitchener was no bs. None of this talk to manager, brb, make you wait or anything. But I also walked in with the attitude of ""give me the price I want, I won't waste your time, let's get this paper signed"". Which is why I recommend buying the car from someone (dealer) different than who was showing you the car.

It's a favorite of our dog to hike.  The Hydro Cut is also an option though you may not like it as much with the little kids as there are often a ton of bikes flying by in the warm months."

waterloo,39c8bp,Spezza,2,Mon Jun 15 23:19:19 2015 UTC,"The Walter Bean Trail that follows the Grand River through the region is quaint. An especially nice portion of the trail goes from St. Jacobs towards the old dam, it is an easy 30-45 minute walk there and back. I'll second big_ol_dump's recommendation for Rockwood. My personal favourites are a little further away, but Mt. Nemo is great and the Nottawasaga Bluffs are nice for a weekend hike."
waterloo,39c8bp,caleeky,2,Sat Jun 13 12:15:08 2015 UTC,"As well as the other recommendations, Avon trail is nice in a number of spots. Runs from St. Marys to Conestogo I believe."
waterloo,39c8bp,CruduxCruo,2,Mon Jun 15 23:20:20 2015 UTC,"health valley trail is pretty good. Runs from the north end of Waterloo (starts on the northern tip of University Ave) to St Jacobs. Goes along a farmers field, the river and through a bit of pasture as well. Part of it is also a horse trail. takes an hour one way, nice to start in Waterloo, go to St Jacobs for lunch and then back."

I can't go either direction between Phillip and Westmount without hitting every red light.  The particular roads they've chosen to close have really messed up my morning commute for the next 6 months.

waterloo,37zirx,medacomix15,3,Sun May 31 21:16:55 2015 UTC,"GO bus runs every day at least once an hour from Waterloo and Kitchener to Aberfoyle, where you can transfer into Guelph. Greyhound only really operates from Kitchener over the summer, every few hours.  GO will probably be slightly cheaper and has considerably better customer service should anything go wrong, but requires a transfer. Greyhound is more direct, but I've seen a lot of people get screwed over by them."
waterloo,37zirx,hippiechan,1 point,Sun May 31 21:23:13 2015 UTC,I saw that the Greyhound was cheapest option with a monthly pass but would you say it's unreliable?
waterloo,37zirx,hippiechan,3,Sun May 31 21:50:34 2015 UTC,"If you're getting a monthly pass maybe not, but my experience selling tickets for both Greyhound and GO tends to be that if anything goes wrong with Greyhound, they'll do nothing to fix it, and will make it impossible for you to make a valid complaint to begin with.  I tend to recommend GO when I can if only for the good customer service that they have. If you travel often between KW and Guelph, check to see if the savings with a Presto card would save you anything! Here's their fare calculator."

waterloo,37v8b2,kwcritic,1 point,Sun May 31 02:11:26 2015 UTC,"Ok, I thought you bought the house and then thought about getting a home inspection.  Personally I would do as much research as possible for your own sake on what to look for in a home. Home inspectors are, well it's a business and they aren't accountable for anything they tell you. So basically you pay someone a few hundred dollars for an hour of their time and you just kinda gotta trust what they say based on their personal biased opinion.  What is the age, and what condition is the house you're looking at buying anyway? If it's been built in the last 40 years and it doesn't look like the home owner tried to change things with a hatchet. I would say you're wasting your time and money getting an inspector in there. But You being a new home owner, should do some research on what to look for.   Bring a screw driver. Take off a few face plates and see what kind of wires are connected to the outlets, make sure they are copper. If they are aluminum you're going to have a hard time getting home insurance. Spend $20 and get your self an electrical outlet tester and plug it in to each outlet to see if they are properly connected and all grounded. Turn on the sink and flush the toilet, does the water pressure drop substantially. Look at the roof. Are the shingles weathered badly are the soffits/fascia/eaves still intact and properly directing the water away from the house. Are there cracks in the foundation that are allowing water to seep into the basement. Look for brown spots on the ceiling and walls, this will indicate water damage. Open and close every window and door in the house and make sure they open and close without resistance. Check under every sink and look for water damage.  These are a few basic checks you can do yourself. There is nothing a home inspector will see that you can't see for yourself if you know what to look for. They walk through the house just like us, and look at things.   With that being said. If you feel more comfortable with having a home inspection(and you should, being a first time buyer) Just try and look for things that I mentioned as well, and educate yourself.   This is your first home. This is a very big deal, and I know you're excited because it's a very exciting experience. I am happy for you. Conragtulations"

Don't take this the wrong way, but you have high expectations. I am not sure what the market is for scientists in Waterloo is, but sometimes you have to start small just to get into the field you want.   If you buy 2 cars for $60,000 that leaves you with $290,000...*You could probably secure a loan from the bank to buy a $800,000 * house given your income and down payment, but I wouldn't recommend that. You shouldn't need a huge empty house.   The current average house price is something like $400,000. In  rural Waterloo they are probably more...in 5 years the average price will probably be up to around 475,000-550,000 (assuming value goes up between 3-4% per year) for a 1750-2000 sqft house new construction.  In my opinion, you should spend very little on cars while you are young and invest in your house as much as possible. If you are able to have 350,000 in 5 years, buy 2 cars for 15-20k MAX and sink most of it into the house and open up a home equity LOC for emergencies. Pay off your house if you can and make some RRSP contributions.   Cars aren't investments, a house is an investment you can enjoy and even if it looses value, you still have it.   Expenses for a new home may be something like this:  Monthly costs:   Taxes: 250-300 Heating: 100-120 Hydro/Util: 100-120 Hot water rental: 40 Security monitor: 35   500   Home Insurance: 50 Car insurance: 250 Life insurance: 35   335   Mortgage:    1250   TV/Internet/Phone/Cells: 70+60+40+50+50:  270 Food:    450-600  So this doesn't include shit like gym memberships and vehicle maintenance and gas or coffee or anything like that. It's just a basic idea of what it may cost for the 2 of you living in a new home assuming no debts. I find it hard to believe you'll have no debts. Car loan, student loan, trips, wedding costs, life in general.   I'm 30, been working for 9 years with a good job. My wife is an RN, we make 140K a year and the money just flies out of the pocket. We have $600,000 in mortgage debt over 2 homes, 2 cars, investments and life in general. Hope my 2 cents helps."

I worked before going into school. We both have investment portfolios since we've been working, and they generate well. We try to be frugal.

waterloo,37t289,purnubdub,1 point,Sun May 31 07:21:21 2015 UTC,"No problem, sorry for the assumption but it's just rare.   The bank would approve you both basically for anything up to $800K, maybe even more if the rates stay low or go lower. Don't forget about first time home-buyers tax credit, saves you some taxes.  If I were in your situation, I'd buy a 1500-1800sqft home between 400,000-550,000 (depending on house prices). 2 cars for 20,000 Maximum because cars are lame investments. Live in that home for 5 years and then figure out if you want/need a larger home. If you work hard at it, you could be mortgage free very soon, and that is priceless. If you have an opportunity to put 300,000 down, that only comes once in a lifetime. A mortgage for 100,000-150,000 could be paid off ""quickly"" if you make over $100k a year and you are reasonable with your money.   Our first home was 1300 sqft ""fixer upper"", we renovated it over 5 years and now rent it out. We live in a 1800 sqft new construction home. Costs add up but our financial/life plan went from a few years to about 10.   There are a bunch of hidden closing costs to the home purchase that hit you after the mortgage papers are signed and completed as well. Closing costs like:   Lawyer fees: 1500+ Land Transfer Tax: 5000+ Disbursement fees for new construction (Depends on the builder): 1500+ (Water heater installation/contract, hydro hook up, utilities down payment+hook up, administration fees, city paperwork, inspections, stuff like that)"
waterloo,37t289,RedSpikeyThing,4,Sun May 31 22:21:43 2015 UTC,"Its possible buy that house costs more than you think. $400k for a house is about right. You'll want 20% down so that's $80k off the top. Mortgage payment will be about $1800 per month. Taxes in Waterloo are high, about 2%, which would be $8k per year $667. That brings your total to $2467 for your house and nothing more.  If you're household income is $120k then you're looking at, what, $70k after taxes? Monthly that's $5800. After your house is paid for that leaves you a little less than $3400 to pay for utilities, insurance, food, gas, save in your RRSP and do something fun.  So yeah that's doable but you could argue that you would be house broke. Guidelines are to spend no more than 30% on mortgage. And if interest rates go up then your mortgage payment will go up. Personally I would try to get that mortgage down with either huge down payment (like $200k since you have it), buy a cheaper house and upgrade later, or rent for a while."

waterloo,37t289,31rhcp,2,Sun May 31 07:24:03 2015 UTC,No you don't have to be in debt sooner or later. You can buy a $250k house and easily afford it. Or rent. There's a stigma against renting that shouldn't exist. You can rent a house that is the same as what you would buy but without any of the risk.

There are very few places that cater to an older audience that are not crazy expensive in Waterloo. Seems a shame that they are always closed so early. That was one of the major problems with the old ownership. Not open on evenings or later on weekends. Makes no sense.   Just sell craft beer and wine and stay open later than 4pm and that place would be a gold mine.

waterloo,37cbif,Ken_Breadbox,1 point,Fri May 29 19:52:16 2015 UTC,Sort of. The idea is that some people generate more garbage than others so they should lay more. There's a minimum covered by taxes.

waterloo,37cbif,superbad,2,Tue May 26 22:02:42 2015 UTC,"The savings is about 0.11% of the budget, so your property taxes might increase by about $3 less than they would have if they kept weekly collection."
waterloo,37cbif,TodayWeEat314,3,Wed May 27 00:57:27 2015 UTC,Will we need to spend money on increased bylaw enforcement to deal with illegal dumping? Or is that already factored in?
waterloo,37cbif,superbad,3,Wed May 27 01:10:08 2015 UTC,"I would suggest looking up the case studies of cities that have already made the switch to see if that is actually a problem or not. The staff report from the region is also public, so you can look at that. I have a feeling that the change in pickup frequency will not require a significant, if any, change in bylaw enforcement staffing levels. Although feel free to correct me if you find evidence otherwise.   I have not read the actual reports at this time."
waterloo,37cbif,TodayWeEat314,4,Wed May 27 01:14:51 2015 UTC,"As an example, see what Hamilton went through when they put weekly limits on household waste. Here's an article about some of the issues they had to deal with.   Personally, I have no problem with meeting the limits. I don't feel the same about all of my neighbours though."
waterloo,37cbif,superbad,1 point,Wed May 27 01:57:42 2015 UTC,"Report said it saves $1.5 million. Region is a little over 560,000 people. So it is about $3 per person. It is not exact, but just an attempt to put it in a more relatable number. Yes, property taxes are not done per person, but this format seemed relatable.   The cost change probably takes into consideration a wide range of effects from the change, you would need to read the report or get more info from staff."
waterloo,37cbif,TodayWeEat314,1 point,Wed May 27 02:06:11 2015 UTC,I don't think people that live in apartments count in the numbers as the region doesn't pay for their garbage pick up.   So that will def change the numbers a lot.
waterloo,37cbif,keyser-_-soze,1 point,Wed May 27 10:39:26 2015 UTC,It is still $1.5 million in savings. The $3/person was just for convenience sake. Feel free to ignore it. The point is that monetarily the savings are relatively small. The main bonus is encouraging waste diversion and extending the life of the current landfill.
waterloo,37cbif,TodayWeEat314,1 point,Wed May 27 11:03:31 2015 UTC,there's also additional savings if you consider that this might actually get people to use their green bins and we can stop overpaying guelph to handle our compostable waste. remember this $1.3M loss?
waterloo,37cbif,schmood,6,Wed May 27 12:20:46 2015 UTC,"Well, it may save them money but it's going to annoy the shit out of me. Where do they think people store their garbage for two weeks?  Thanks a lot Kitchener."
waterloo,37cbif,thelatestmodel,6,Wed May 27 12:49:58 2015 UTC,There is still recycling and green bin pick up every week though.
waterloo,37cbif,80b,5,Wed May 27 13:43:11 2015 UTC,"It's not quantity but quality. It doesn't take a lot of dirty diapers sitting around for two weeks to reek. Now, scale that up to a bag or two."
waterloo,37cbif,Faranae,2,Tue May 26 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"Doggy doo-doo bags are awesome for that actually. They're small bags, fit a diaper perfect, and when you tie them shut there's no smell to worry about. Toss em in your normal trash and they're fine."

waterloo,37cbif,thelatestmodel,4,Wed May 27 20:13:00 2015 UTC,"It's just kind of annoying when you have a small place with nowhere to put excess garbage if it occurs. I'm already pretty recycling conscious, thanks."
waterloo,37cbif,Faranae,1 point,Wed May 27 22:54:26 2015 UTC,What about green waste? Any food or other compost-able waste really makes garbage reek after a few days.
waterloo,37cbif,Pbrisebois,1 point,Wed May 27 00:56:21 2015 UTC,Green bin pick-up will be weekly.
waterloo,37cbif,Faranae,1 point,Tue May 26 18:31:07 2015 UTC,"That was my point. It was in response to someone saying they had excess garbage, I was suggesting they cut out green waste from the normal bin. :)"

waterloo,37cbif,Foodwraith,1 point,Wed May 27 15:16:08 2015 UTC,$818M (maybe) for a train to go from mall to mall that we don't need (yet/ever) vs Garbage pick up once every 2 weeks + eventually fees. This is because the green box plan was a monumental waste of money and failed project. We pay taxes for services. This is a fundamental change in service. See you next election Regional Council.

waterloo,37cbif,qedi,5,Wed May 27 22:53:16 2015 UTC,"What are you all throwing out that is overly smelly in the trash? If your garbage smells after a week, maybe you have too much green waste in it? That's the whole point here."

waterloo,37cbif,Faranae,3,Fri May 29 21:04:31 2015 UTC,"You do not need to buy liners for the green bin. Grab some scrap flyers/newspaper/dollar store paper lunch bags. Put your green waste in one of those bags, or wrap it loosely in newspaper before putting it in the green bin. Less mess/waste, and you only have to rinse out your green bin if something spills."

Zippered plastic bags are recyclable if you cut the zipper off. Tetra packs are recyclable, and so are plastic containers. The crinkly plastic bags (in cereal) are not recyclable, but occupy very little space. I can't think of any other food packaging except take-out containers? The cardboard ones are greenbin-able but the styrofoam ones do take up a lot of space in the trash. I don't know any students who can afford to eat a lot of take-out though."

waterloo,36wabw,hbalagtas,5,Fri May 22 17:24:56 2015 UTC,"TekSavvy will give you the advertised speed, so yes it is faster (100 vs 30). I'd certainly consider more than triple the speed to be ""considerably faster"".  But what I think you're really asking is, will you notice? That's more subjective. If you have 5 people in your house trying to watch Netflix at once you'll notice, if you're redownloading your Steam library you'll notice. If you're just browsing Facebook you probably won't notice. It depends on what you use your internet for, and how many people will be using it at once."

waterloo,36wabw,CoryCA,5,Sat May 23 18:11:21 2015 UTC,"The thing about mbits advertisement is youll get 100mbits/s but that translates to something like 30mb/s.(on a good day)   There's 8 bits to a Byte, so raw that would be 12.5 MB/s. Take off expected TCP/IP and other overheads and you'll get roughly 10MB/s download. If you're expecting 30MB/s off of a 100Mb/s, you need to review your understand of how bits translates into bytes. Or your expectations for link compression :-)   megabits and megabytes are different. ISPs use numbers and units like mbits and mbs to confuse the consumer.   No, they don't - they use industry standard terminology. Network speeds are always quoted in bits per second (with the appropriate prefix) and download caps are quoted in bytes (no per seconds). In 20 years working as an IT consultant, I don't think I've ever come across advertising from an ISP that did not do that, except the occasional obvious typo. Now when speaking with you, the sales person might say merely ""megabits"" and ""megabytes"" instead of ""megabits per second"" and ""megabytes of download"", but it's quite clear that bits is speed and bytes is quantity."

waterloo,36wabw,THISgai,2,Fri May 22 17:52:26 2015 UTC,100Mbps is about 12.5MB/sec downloading (when you are connected to a fast source) whereas 30Mbps is 3.75MB/sec.

waterloo,36jp6g,Maasio,1 point,Wed May 20 00:26:17 2015 UTC,Are you looking to do just adult hockey or minor as well?  Have you officiated before? Most officials start off learning in minor and work their way up. KW has its organizations split between cities and you typically have to choose one side or the other for minor.  You can use the contact form on either the Kitchener minor hockey website or the Waterloo minor hockey site and they'll put you in touch with the ref in chief of those centres.  Adult hockey typically won't accept rookie refs out of the gate. You'll need your level 3 at least which you get in two years if you're good.  If you're interested in the Kitchener side you can pm me and I can pass along a contact as I used to ref in the area.

waterloo,35eezi,isUsername,12,Sat May 9 19:19:44 2015 UTC,"I live in a Drewlo building as well. The notice they put up is a generic one used every year, however, our building super said it will almost certainly be sooner than two weeks.  There's a few reasons why this happens:   Units are cooled or heated using one central fluid circulation system, with heat exchangers in each unit. It's super-efficient in comparison to individual A/C units, but that means that the system can either heat or cool, but not do both at the same time. The Residential Tenancies Act requires that a landlord be able to supply the necessary heating to keep units above 20C (may be higher depending on local bylaws) until June 15th. Because of this, the landlord has to be certain that the weather won't result in the temperature of the units dropping below 20C if they choose to turn on the A/C before June 15th. When your landlord wants to do the switch over, it's likely that every other landlord with the same type of system will want to do the same around that time, and it has to be done by a technician to do the switch and perform the annual maintenance on the system, such as flushing out the lines to remove sediment that has built up. This creates a waiting list.   A few years ago, the Goodlife Fitness at Market Square had an issue where a heatwave came in but they couldn't get the A/C turned on for a couple of weeks. I didn't go for those couple of weeks because (thanks to this gym part of the building being mostly windows) the temperature was scorching and impossible to work out in."

waterloo,34zxra,WaterlooWaddleDoo,1 point,Wed May 6 01:05:04 2015 UTC,"Sadly, there are actually some people who need to work that much in order to support their bills - but you are certainly right that it isnt common  I wish no one was ignorant enough to believe the meme, but people post it to their social networks on a regular basis, which clearly demonstrates that some people think it actually holds some level of truth - even though it DOESNT - and hence me making the video (to clarify that fact)  Further, its good to hear you are trying to make a better life for yourself, though Im sorry you're being weighed down by student debt, (like many other people who are trying to work their way out of poverty). I really hope you are certain that what you are studying has a guaranteed job at the end, because there are countless people who go to school with the goal of getting a career and working their way out of poverty - only to find themselves in the group of the working poor, who cant find any jobs beyond stacking shelves; because there just arent as many jobs available, as there are graduates these days :/  And if you check out the video that was linked about half way through this one that we are discussing (called poor no more), it explains how the set up of O.W. is structured to make sure people use up every last little resource they have, before ever being provided help (such as spending their RRSPs, or selling their vehicles, etc) - and doing this leaves people in that much more of a whole of debt and lack of resources; making it that much harder to get out of the impoverished situation.   I agree you shoulndt pity those on O.W. because pitying them only makes them feel like lesser people - and thats not fair or right. But if you could also take a bit of time to recognize that even though there are sadly some recipients who are scamming the system and could otherwise be working, the majority of recipients are actually like your mother, or myself - that being disabled and waiting to get on disability, or unable to find work in their local area... few people ever actually WANT to be on assistance - its just that or the streets for many..."

waterloo,34zoz6,SamuraiSmurfette,6,Tue May 5 22:19:10 2015 UTC,"This is coming from economically depressed Manchester NH (I lived near there for two years in nearby Amherst NH) which also is a hotbed of libertarian conservative Ayn Rand / von Mises type thinking of course they won't want a light rail as that would be an affront to ""The Taxpayer"" who, if not personally planning to use or benefit from the light rail, should naturally not have to pay for it. (Because we can't be paying for the common good now...)  Manchester also isn't nearly as a dense a city as KW nor do they have the smart growth (green belt, growth limits) policies that promote densification like KW does. It's apples and oranges and NH esp Manchester doesn't have the tech sector or knowledge capital to ever promote this sort of thing.  It's simply not time for self-driven vehicles yet.  Additionally self-driven vehicles are still vehicles and take up space on the road, cause wear and tear on the existing road infrastructure, and still promote individuals traveling alone and the energy waste that comes with that."
waterloo,34zoz6,bingbingy,-2,Tue May 5 22:27:21 2015 UTC,"I don't get a libertarian vibe from this article, or from myself. KW is not dense, either. People are going to need to get themselves and material objects to more specific places than a streetcar will allow. The future of regional transportation is not trains, nor will that reality go away simply because we have spent a great sum of money locally. This conversation doesn't get to stop because we are tired of it and have spent vast amounts of money.   It could have been wear and tear on existing infrastructure, for some hundreds of millions of dollars less. It's an unpleasant truth that doesn't change because you don't like it."
waterloo,34zoz6,CoryCA,4,Wed May 6 01:21:34 2015 UTC,"The Cato Institute is a well-known libertarian think tank, and as much as I love Penn and Teller for their magic and for their general Skeptical out look (Penn throws an awesome bacon & donut party, BTW), I dislike their association with this group.  However, this article doesn't raise any new points that we haven't heard before herein Waterloo Region, and ignores problems that have been pointed out with bus-based systems.  Technology prediction is fraught with issues, as any science fiction reader knows. For example, in terms of accuracy Siri & Google Now are not much better  than Dragon Naturally Speaking was on my i486 was 20 years ago. Yes, you don't have to train them, but they still haven't surpassed that 95-98% accuracy rate. For all we know, autonomous cars will have an analogous block and twenty years from now autonomous cars will still only good for the highways but, like the Delphi example, will still need the human to take over for urban driving because they can't yet decide whether hit the pedestrian or the bollard.  Even if autonomous vehicles are successful and soon, not only will they still get stuck in traffic congestion but platoons of them will contribute to it as well, and they will continue suffer all the problems that non-autonomous buses suffer from. Even though autonomous vehicles would let you crowd more cars onto the roads, those roads can only be widened so far, so the best that can happen is delaying the inevitable.  Buses will always have an upper limit of scalability that rail will always be able to surpass. That fact, that ""unpleasant truth"" will not go away for you just because you want it to."

Remember, the projections to handle that growth were 500 new lane kilometres over the next 20 years.  500km * $46.4M/km = $23.2B  That's more than 10 times greater than even the $1.8B for the total costs of building and operating Ion for 1.5 times as long!

Parking at Yorkdale is free, and the subway is roughly $5/person for a round trip I belive. The subway goes straight to union and it's about a 10 minute walk to the dome from there.   Alternatively, if you'd rather drive straight downtown, get off at the exit after the skydome (signs for Air Canada Centre), turn right when you get to the bottom of the ramp and theres an entrance to a parking garage immediately on your right. Sometimes they have signs there, sometimes they don't, but it's always open. Only $15 to park for the game.

Having lived in and around the area for many years, as well, there is a high level of drug-related crime. When I was young, my father would have to circle around a couple times before dropping us off at my mothers, mainly because the cops were doing busts at the time."

My boyfriend and I lived near the Boardwalk south of University in a great neighborhood that had lots of young families and people our age. We weren't students either and really didn't want to live near students. We just moved after 2.5 years in that neighborhood and we already miss it! Great commuting times (him to UW, and me to work in Kitchener.) It's not too early to start looking, securing a lease now will make it easier come fall season. Also, I'm not sure if you're from Waterloo, but we were warned not to live too close to the dump. Erb/Ira Needles or anywhere north of it tends to smell pretty bad in the summer months when the dump starts to heat up! Hope this helps! :)  Edit: Spelling"

I agree on avoiding the Brybeck / Vanier / Westmount + Ottawa / Highland + Westmount / Mooregate Crescent / Lorraine areas in Kitchener  I like living by the Park in Kitchener or Belmont Village as they still feel urban but without the student concentration  They also cater to people who are not in couples or in families (me) a bit more but are still walkable rather than being in a more suburban Laurelwood / St Clair  / Block Line kind of setting where you can only walk to generic shopping centres and that sort

waterloo,34r6ca,azGRIMES,1 point,Sun May 3 22:31:26 2015 UTC,It would likely just be by-law coming by and giving out tickets if it gets too loud. Police only show up to parties if anything serious happens.

Ill stop by for the party. lol jk  One time cops got called to a house party when I was in HS and the party got dispursed pretty quickly because kids are scarsd shitless when it comes to cops. I saw people jumping the fence into other home's backyards because of an inlaw. haha. Most times though the cops just tell you to STFU and be civil. They usually cant barge in without a warrant or consent so they cant tell if there are underage drinkers inside. just be quiet and civil and you wont have problems.

Circular manholes are used because the lip that the cover it's on means the circle of the opening is smaller in diameter than the cover so it cannot be accidentally dropped through. A manhole cover could only flip if were balanced on two fulcrum points such that one side could be pushed down while the opposite side comes up. That lip all the way around, however, means you can't push one side down like that to make it flip."

waterloo,33skj2,CoryCA,3,Sat Apr 25 05:19:23 2015 UTC,"LRT is the best thing to happen to this place and one of the things that is keeping me here -- moved here to work for BB, now at Manu...watching to see how things go but hoping the LRT and increased tech investment makes us a bit more Seattle meets Portland and a lot less London meets Stratford.   I'm from East Coast US, been here 8+ years and have seen positive movement in that direction."
waterloo,33skj2,bingbingy,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:00:19 2015 UTC,"Considering the Liberal's record on things they say they will do, the statement that they may do this is on par with a statement that you may win a million dollars."
waterloo,33skj2,isUsername,2,Sat Apr 25 16:00:33 2015 UTC,"And how is that record any different than any political party's record?  We all know that no government gets to implement all the programmes it wants to. Not the Liberals, not the PCs, not the NDP.  Something happens that it outside their control, like a global recession, and people vote out the current government, whomever that happens to be, because they associate that government with harder times. Send the relevant laws, regulations, trade agreements, etc... that affect this may have been made a decade ago under a different party. Much like animals evolving through natural selection, historical contingency is important here, too.  So I think it's more important to judge a party based on what they would like to accomplish, and how they would do it, if possible.  A government that is willing to spend on large infrastructure projects, if given the chance, which help stimulate the economy during the down times and keep people employed is far more preferable to one that is going to reduce social programmes and enact tax cuts that only benefit the rich and do nothing keep people employed or help them when they are not."
waterloo,33skj2,isUsername,3,Sat Apr 25 18:14:03 2015 UTC,"These types of comments were silly during the 2014 election. Now, after the 2015 budget has been released, they're just ludicrous. Plus, there are multiple false equivocations in your post:  1) The old ""all the other parties would be the same"" cop-out. Well for one, we've only had one NDP government in Ontario (led by a Liberal) and, aside from that and the PCs, no other party has been given a shot. You can't claim that the track records of governments is an indication of the other political parties' likely performance when the government has been a duopoly of parties.  2) That the result of stated goals, explicit promises, and strategic decisions should be treated the same. They shouldn't. Promising two-thirds funding for LRT and 2012 shovels in the ground for Highway 7 is different than a stated goal to implement all-day, two-way GO train service. A stated goal to implement all-day, two-way GO train service is different from the strategic decision of stating such a goal when you know that it cannot be implemented in a reasonable time frame.  The weight of a strategic decision is greater than the weight of an explicit promise, which is greater than the weight of a stated goal. We can't trust the honesty of this government's strategic decisions and explicit promises, but should trust their honesty on a stated goal?  You are giving weight and credit to a non-committal goal from a government that has broke numerous big-ticket, explicit promises to our region, and, even more recently, attacked Tim Hudak's plan that included public-sector layoffs, labour disruption and selling Hydro One, and then turned around and took a course of action that had those exact same elements in their next budget.  It's astonishing that, in light of the provincial budget, you'd attempt to dismiss the government's track record in such areas and base your position entirely on their word of a possible result. It's inexcusably naive at best, and disingenuous political hackery at worst.  At the very least, your cop-out and false equivalences simply shows that the government's statement of their goal really is a worthless statement."

waterloo,33n3ft,fon10alis,1 point,Sat Apr 25 10:39:05 2015 UTC,"This would be amazing!   However, here are some of the truths! Any hole in the wall in DT is going to be at least $2000. Add to that utilities, internet, insurance and youre looking closer to $3500. Add Mats, Brown Stock and cleaning and your at $4500. That is $150 a day before you have even sold anything. If you want to have cheap food and drink (prepackaged pop and chips, chocolate bars etc) you are looking at 50% margin to keep the prices reasonable. That requires $300/day in sales. This is before anyone gets paid, or you have any equipment to serve (for food and coffee, you need to have health board approved facilities). Realistically, the owner should be paid something, lets go $10/hr slave wages - no overtime - at minimal opening hours that is $2400 more, add some leased equipment and youre now at $3000. Now we are talking $500 sales/day just to cover operating expenses and slave labour. Not trying to rain on anyone's parade, but that is the reality.   We still offer music and open mics, but they are a way of giving back to the community. This is the reality of the business - I'd love to see someone find a way, via city grant or charity to make this work, however, as a business it is almost impossible."

If you want to do coffee, you need to be on the main strip to get the required number of walk-ins to pay the bills. Let be tell you that the rent is absolutely insane there. So, unless you have the kind of money to compete with DVLB, it seems unlikely.  In Kitchener, you already have Matter of Taste and Cafe Pyrus, which sort of do something similar. There also used to be a business that did literally exactly what you talked about. They pumped not a small amount of money into the project and, if I recall correctly, it went under in about 8 weeks.   If you are serious, you may need to consider selling some booze to pay the bills and work from there."

waterloo,33n3ft,r0naa,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:12:10 2015 UTC,"I might not be your target demographics but I feel I can help. I am a CS student who has a lot of interest for Fine Arts.  I would pay a lot to have a place where I can work and meet like minded people. I am from France and there is this great place called the ""Anti-cafe"" where you don't pay for anything (including drinks + food) but the time you spent. They hand you a little magnetic card when you arrive and when you have to go you just ""swipe"" and it tells you how much you owe the café. There is books and board games available, it's a very chill place. Long story short, it's awesome.  There is weekly events (every Wednesday I think) where philosophers, University scholars, painters and poets come to make talks, workshops or open mics. I believe that there have been a couple vernissages from pretty cool Parisian artists.   I know the person who started this concept and he is doing really well. He is opening (has opened?) two more anti-cafe in Paris and Roma.   I think it's amazing how he successfully built a community of enthusiast scholars while addressing a problem that a lot of people (18yo -> 40yo) have: lack of good co-working space.  People are very respectful and clean their own stuff to keep the space clean. He only wash the café once a day and does not have a lot of cost outside of rent + electricity + internet + coffee machine + biscuits. No waiters, no maintenance, no marketing and no competitors... I want to remind you that we are talking of Paris! You can find a good and cheap restaurant/bakery at every corner, it is a hyper competitive market with the average player being really good and people having very high-standards. This is almost a miracle.  Just my 0.02$ to tell you that the right approach to build such a place might be counterintuitive or even completely contrarian to classic standards for restaurants."

If you become a member, you do not need more insurance on you own the way you would with a car rental compoany (who often sell you that insurance as an add-on). The co-op takes care of the insurance for you and there are also cards for Esso and Shell (I think) so you do not pay when you gas up the car.  However, if you need a car for a full day, a normal car rental might be economical as the car share is only really intended for a few hours here and there. Going to Toronto to for the day (7am-7pm) is going to cost you  $28 for the hours (with the regular plan, $40 with the occasional plan) and $69 in mileage (230km round-trip @ $0.30/km) for $97(or $109) where even with the insurance add-on a tradition car company for 24 hours is under $70 and unlimited mileage."

I learned to drive over 20 years ago and these guys will teach you confidence on the roads. They are more expensive by a long shot. All the schools will get you the same discount on insurance.  YD will teach you collision avoidance and what to do in odd situations. They teach you best practices that I still use to this day such as Threshold Braking, Point of no Return, and other anti-crash techniques. Some of these techniques are considered common sense however it's drilled into your mind.  My anecdotal evidence from friends and family members with other schools involves the student running errands for the instructor and spending time in parking lots."

I naturally freak out and he immediately chides me saying that's not the proper reaction.    He told me shift into neutral and start your car again quickly.  He went on further to say that those that panic when something goes afoul is the ones that get into accidents.  He went on to repeat this a few other times on different driving lessons and conditioned me to react to the solution instead of the cause.

waterloo,32x2lw,Shambly,5,Fri Apr 17 16:13:21 2015 UTC,I believe that there is Pizza and Wings House in Kitchener (Breithaupt at King St). I haven't tried it though.
waterloo,32x2lw,nt3rp,2,Fri Apr 17 14:57:54 2015 UTC,I have and it's fucking awesome.
waterloo,32x2lw,Prolix_Logodaedalist,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:43:57 2015 UTC,did it come with the shawarma sauce on top of the pizza?  Edit:Doesn't say on just eat so just wondering
waterloo,32x2lw,spyd4r,3,Sat Apr 18 00:30:39 2015 UTC,Had some at Arabesque on Victoria.
waterloo,32x2lw,GeneralButts,3,Fri Apr 17 17:22:54 2015 UTC,There's one right on the corner of King and Ontario in downtown kitchener. Pretty much directly across from Zoup.

waterloo,32wvlh,BigBonzo,2,Fri Apr 17 14:25:34 2015 UTC,I have a pair of Rockports that I bought last year. I obviously did not wear them out in the winter but they still look new. I just wipe them down once a week to get all the dust and dirt off. I think I paid around $80 for them.
waterloo,32wvlh,cinemagraph,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:30:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll need a good winter shoe recommendation in October too. I tried some crappy ""dress boot"" from Sears that literally fell apart after 2.5 months."
waterloo,32wvlh,vorpalz,2,Fri Apr 17 14:37:32 2015 UTC,"I got a pair of Blundstone that lasted me about 6 years with only minimal care. Once they broke in they were the most comfortable boots I've every worn. I wore them all through the winters, but since they aren't insulated, you'll probably want some warm socks."
waterloo,32wvlh,vorpalz,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:13:07 2015 UTC,"Just to add to your conversation,  there is a Rockport outlet in Kitchener where SportsWorld use to be. Next to the Rebock outlet (same company)."

It's an amazing place to work that pays very well, I'd hate to see the store's quality of service suffer because of focusing on constantly re-hiring."

I know there's a lot of newspaper articles citing very high pay at costco, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of evidence to support it."
waterloo,32tga9,shepd,2,Fri Apr 17 05:26:48 2015 UTC,"Walmart will start a new employee at about $2-3 less per hour than Costco, as an example.   Those are starting wages. The average wages are much higher than that, especially considering Costco focuses on keeping their employees around rather than training new ones every three months. The longer you're there, the better life gets for you.   Also, the reason it's generally considered ""high pay"" is because it is still a retail job, They usually pay minimum and fight like hell to keep you at as little wage as possible (I'm looking at you, Walmart)."
waterloo,32tga9,Faranae,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:05:29 2015 UTC,"Have you ever worked at Walmart? They pay all employees above minimum wage.  Also, in the US, their average wage for full times is about $5 above minimum, and for part-times, it's $3 above minimum."
waterloo,32tga9,checksum,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:20:52 2015 UTC,"That's odd. My sister-in-law started at minimum wage when she worked at the Fairview Walmart. Sorry if I am uninformed, I'm just going by what I've seen personally."
waterloo,32tga9,Faranae,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"In the US (hard to find out for Canada because, well, nobody ever seems to do thorough reporting for this country!) Walmart actually uses paying above the minimum wage as a way to put the squeeze on mom and pop retail competition.  Most mom 'n pop stores pay minimum wage and would be devastated by a $15 an hour (or whatever the popular number is today) minimum wage, whereas Walmart has enough meat left on the bone to pay above that.  As Walmart is reported to be a less-than-pleasant employer, some will prefer the flexibility of a mom 'n pop store, so the higher money isn't cutting it for Walmart.  How do you solve the issue if you're Walmart?  Campaign for a minimum wage that matches what you pay.  poof overnight the mom 'n pop store is out of business and those displaced employees are probably going to suck it up and work at Walmart.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/beltway/2014/02/11/raising-the-minimum-wage-would-be-good-for-wal-mart-and-america/  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-19/wal-mart-says-looking-at-support-of-federal-minimum-wage-rise"

It will still be a 15min drive for me to get to either Cambridge Costco or the purposed Costco in Waterloo. I am located at near Lancaster and Wellington St.   Pros: More tax money for the city, infrastructure improvements, Jobs  Cons: Traffic congestion, Location?, Competition?"
waterloo,32tga9,purnubdub,3,Thu Apr 16 19:14:08 2015 UTC,My parents drive to the one in Guelph. Apparently it's on our side of Guelph and it's nowhere near as busy as King st. Worth a check out.
waterloo,32tga9,Quock,2,Fri Apr 17 16:54:12 2015 UTC,Correct. Guelph Costco is the way to go.
waterloo,32tga9,bingbingy,2,Sat Apr 25 19:44:33 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, because it might make the Kitchener Costco less busy."
waterloo,32tga9,superbad,2,Sun Apr 19 12:33:19 2015 UTC,I think that will be the primary benefit for us. Costco will win because they will most likely get some more members.
waterloo,32tga9,purnubdub,1 point,Mon Apr 20 11:32:45 2015 UTC,A fifteen minute drive to a Costco? What a hardship.
waterloo,32tga9,downvote_prince,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:06:46 2015 UTC,"Well my point is that even though they are going to add a Costco to Kitchener, it will still take the same amount of time to get there because of traffic. The main benefit may be that the parking lot is less busy, and the sample lines won't be as congested with what I call ""The Vultures"". :-)"

waterloo,32tga9,pommedeguerre,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:24:32 2015 UTC,I drive through Homer Watson & Blockline road roundabout everyday and I have little to no issues. The people that have real problems there are heavy truck drivers  (No pun intended...) Transport trucks. Our truck driver says he needs to straddle both lanes leading into the roundabout to let people know he needs both lanes in while he's in it. Other drivers try to push in beside him and it causes problems.   Edit: Sounded...odd

waterloo,32tglt,CambridgeReporter,2,Thu Apr 16 16:05:50 2015 UTC,I dont get why they want to strike. anyone want to fill me in?
waterloo,32tglt,thirdeyecyclops,2,Fri Apr 17 06:04:49 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert but do have a bit of insight on it - my view point is it comes down to philosophical differences. People believe it has to do with money but the main sticking points are benefits and the lack of a contract. After speaking with a number of teachers I know, none have said they ""want"" to go on strike - it would impact a lot of them as well from a childcare standpoint. However it really is their only negotiation tactic and is a fair and legal option available as a union."
waterloo,32tglt,pandas_love_pancakes,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:43:33 2015 UTC,So May 4th is the first possible date of what may be absolutely nothing or may be a full-on strike. Cool story.

waterloo,32p48q,JugglingReferee,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:33:57 2015 UTC,"You should be able to call anyone advertising they're a handyman to fix this.  It's a very simple low cost repair.  If you want to do it yourself, cut a piece of drywall to fit (cut the hole so it's even if you need to).  Screw it to a larger piece of plywood, leaving a screw half-way screwed out as a ""handle"".  Insert in the hole, drywall side out.  Add screws around the hole through to the wood.  Slap on some drywall filler (perhaps some tape would be a good idea), smooth it out with a putty knife, sand.  All that's left is painting."
waterloo,32mnt7,raw-deal,6,Wed Apr 15 00:36:30 2015 UTC,"Man, I am really not sure how I feel about this. On one side of things, it will have zero effect on our household as, even with our newborn, we don't produce that much garbage (we use the green bin a lot). Saving money and encouraging people to. Use the green bins is a fantastic idea.  On the other hand, large families are going to be hit the hardest, and are likely the group which will find it most difficult to adapt.   Either way, I wish more people on my street used a green bin. I thing I've seen a handful out or maybe 50 houses. It is disappointing to say the least."
waterloo,32mnt7,talues,5,Wed Apr 15 02:46:52 2015 UTC,"I'm one of the large families (2 adults, 3 kids, 1 dog) and I welcome this change.  It's necessary for the environment and will cut down on taxes (lol).  As for the green bin, yes it's difficult to adapt and mainly due to teaching the kids to actually use the green bin.  They are quite aware of what goes where but it's getting them to use it.  But it's necessary and we'll manage."
waterloo,32mnt7,squeegeeboy,3,Wed Apr 15 15:22:11 2015 UTC,"Same with us, no real impact but I would love it if it drove adoption on the green bin.  I would have loved to see landlords get hit a lot harder with these changes. We're near some single-family to rental conversions (mostly catering to students) that have abysmal trash sorting practices."
waterloo,32mnt7,onesonesones,2,Wed Apr 15 03:08:28 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a landlord, it's extremely difficult to get tenants to care about trash.    If the city lets them throw 10 bags out, they'll throw 10 bags out.    I'd hate to lose the virtual no bag limit in the city because it's so convenient.  But, it's not the landlord's responsibility to make tenants care about landfill preservation and environmental preservation.  It just doesn't register with their priorities."
waterloo,32mnt7,cutbigfoot,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:18:43 2015 UTC,"Take a walk through the residential areas near regina at the end of the school year, it isn't just the tenants. Landlords routinely dump anything left over on the curb.  I get that it's probably tough to convince tenants to manage waste properly. But it should be considered a cost of doing business and not an unfortunate externality that the rest of the city, and especially people in those neighborhoods have to absorb for you."
waterloo,32mnt7,harmar21,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:27:46 2015 UTC,I used to live across the street from Conestoga College and it wasn't unusual to see a 5 trash bags and a single blue bin in front of every house.
waterloo,32mnt7,superbad,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:42:40 2015 UTC,"I used to use greenbin but stopped. I live on my own and produce very little. So that means I put it out every week with a couple things in it, or wait a couple weeks but then it gets really gross. In the summer it also stinks bad.  If I had a family I for sure would use it, but for just myself, it goes in the trash. I do use blue bin as much as I can.  I find using both green  bin + blue bin can easily reduce your waste by 50-75%."
waterloo,32mnt7,canadianviking,4,Fri Apr 17 15:46:22 2015 UTC,I'm not happy about all the illegal dumping that we're going to be seeing soon.
waterloo,32mnt7,superbad,3,Wed Apr 15 12:22:22 2015 UTC,"I'm single, and all for double thinking how much waste I produce. My only issue with this is the fact they won't take recycling if it's not in a blue box. Sometimes I have too much, and anytime I've put out a cardboard box of obvious recyclables, it doesn't get taken.  How about making it easier to recycle?"
waterloo,32mnt7,harmar21,3,Wed Apr 15 15:01:43 2015 UTC,"If this happens often, you could get another blue box."
waterloo,32mnt7,sonofamitch10,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:44:06 2015 UTC,"I never have that problem. I routinely have it outside the box and always gets picked up. What I do is flatten all boxes, bundle them up in a stack, then tie a string around it both ways. I also have 3 blue boxes"

We're going to rolling bins and every other week garbage and recycling collection, as well as weekly organics, starting next year. Really, at this point, most waste a house produces should be organic and should be organic recycled, unless of course, Wat. Region's organics facilities somehow can't handle it."
waterloo,32mnt7,waterluvian,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:27:12 2015 UTC,"If it's being done to save money, great.  If it's being done to beat people into using green bins, bad.  The city has better things to do than worry about keeping edibles out of the trash stream.  If we're doing it to ""save the environment"", how about starting with something serious, like banning trashing batteries and mercury filled CFLs?  Billions of banana peels in the dump just makes it full, not toxic.  And, as far as filling it goes, this plan seems to be buying us a whole 365 days.  Again, bigger, better things to worry about."
waterloo,32mnt7,shepd,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:38:14 2015 UTC,It's being done to preserve the lifespan of the landfill. Less pickup and more in green bins is one way to do that. Bananas can rot anywhere. Garbage can't.
waterloo,32mnt7,mashmo,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:34:32 2015 UTC,"I did mention that.  It appears based on the city's estimates it will extend the lifespan of the landfill by 2% from the original build, or 5% from today.  I would suggest the city would get much more value for money by using this time, effort, and cost to search for where the next landfill will be.  2036 will come soon enough, and 2035 is just behind it."
waterloo,32mnt7,CoryCA,1 point,Fri Apr 17 04:35:56 2015 UTC,about time but more should be done. would be great to see experimenting with designated drop off areas to eliminate/minimize door-to-door pick up.
waterloo,32mnt7,sonofamitch10,1 point,Thu Apr 16 13:19:24 2015 UTC,"Egads, the comments on that are headdesk worthy. Not a single iota of self-reflection and thinking about how to alter their lifestyles to possibly produce less garbage. Instead just a lot of First World entitlement bitching and moaning."
waterloo,32mnt7,sonofamitch10,3,Wed Apr 15 05:38:33 2015 UTC,"Increased taxes, reduced service. Painting everyone with the same brush. Terribly limited survey.   There are valid reasons for people to not to agree with this. Not everyone is as happy just bending over and taking what they give us.  What about seasonal times like Christmas when there's definitely a lot more waste? Are they going to tell people to stop buying stuff? that's good for the economy.."
waterloo,32mnt7,sonofamitch10,2,Wed Apr 15 13:17:40 2015 UTC,"So you think the city should not try to save money on waste collection or extend the longevity of its assets (the dump in this case)?  If the city saves 1.5 million on garbage collection by encouraging people to change their habits just a bit, that's 1.5 million that they can divert to something else.   I think The Record may have gotten the facts about the survey wrong because it was done online. Everyone who did it got free green bin bags; http://www.therecord.com/news-story/5177520-waterloo-region-wants-feedback-on-changes-to-garbage-pickup/"
waterloo,32mnt7,sonofamitch10,2,Wed Apr 15 14:07:19 2015 UTC,"No, I totally support fiscal responsibility. Take away some of the service I pay for, give me some of the money back. I'd rather they save me (taxpayers) money.   It is wrong to paint everyone with the same brush is all. A Family of 5 has more waste than a family of 2."
waterloo,32mnt7,CoryCA,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:23:26 2015 UTC,Savings here mean fewer increases for other services.   More than two full-sized garbage bags per week? I grew up in a family of 5 and I don't see how you could create that much waste with proper diversion.
waterloo,32mnt7,sonofamitch10,2,Wed Apr 15 16:08:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's not a lot of waste. Some weeks I may have 3 bags, others I might have 0. It depends what I'm doing I suppose.   These are all theoretical examples though. My point is, I'm paying for a service. If you reduce my service, reduce what I pay.    Savings here mean fewer increases for other services.   Probably not."
waterloo,32mnt7,waterluvian,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"Probably not.   It's not like the money evaporates. Agree or disagree with the city's spending, money saved here means they can use it on other services."
waterloo,32mnt7,superbad,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:53:36 2015 UTC,"you're right, they absolutely can. I'd just prefer it stayed in my pocket."
waterloo,32mnt7,infinite-blue,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:55:43 2015 UTC,"My family switched to mostly using gift bags and tissue paper and reusing them every year. We also take care to to put the wrapping paper we do use into recycling, along with item's original packaging which is almost always recyclable.  So much stuff these days is recyclable and apparently 55% of it in Ontario still ends up in landfills. Notice that green and blue bins are still scheduled for pickup every week. Let that family of 5 rinse out their tin cans and yogurt containers and get another blue bin instead of putting the stuff in the garbage."
waterloo,32mnt7,canadianviking,2,Wed Apr 15 15:33:30 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm all for more recycling. Perhaps our bigger government needs to put restrictions on packaging to reduce waste for the whole country. I personally won't use the green bin much, since I want all that nice compost for myself.   My family ...    Buy a new TV and it will contain 2 garbage bags full of Styrofoam by itself. We can find 100 examples when it's enough, and 100 opposing examples when it's not.   Education and Advocacy should be used instead of Rules and Restrictions for the individual taxpayers.  I have waste, I pay taxes, those taxes help make my waste go away. If they want to reduce that service, reduce my taxes."

waterloo,32ivwm,gramw,2,Sun Apr 19 16:11:27 2015 UTC,On a related note - is anyone else getting peeved that every detour route that GRT has put up for the main King St. construction is now also under heavy construction?  Couldn't they have staggered or planned this better?  Going from dtk to uptown takes ~15-20+ minutes in the mornings and evenings now.
waterloo,32ivwm,gramw,4,Tue Apr 14 20:48:23 2015 UTC,"Stretching out the LRT construction over more seasons would have added a lot of cost. It's going to suck for (under) 2 years, but then it's going to be done.  Edit: we also don't exactly have a lot of parallel routes, so detours are nontrivial."
waterloo,32ivwm,CoryCA,4,Tue Apr 14 23:12:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said.  Weber St. construction isn't directly LRT construction though (related) -  just poor planning to do the street widening at the same time, especially when it's used as the main detour route.    Of course, having said all of this, I'm reading now that the Weber St widening was supposed to be completed last fall, so it's all a moot point.  I'll blame construction delays."

Because connecting with the UW stop is quite the detour off of Columbia/University, which would add quite a lot of travel time and take away from their current directness.    Not to mention, with no real clear road connection (at least as the current situation stands), there would have to be some crazy routing like a turn onto Phillip -> turn into the parking lot between ECH and the former BB buildings -> loop around by the station and head back, no? Considering Ring Road isn't really an option with no place to turn around... Unless they have a bus only road going over the tracks near the UW stop to connect Ring Road to Phillip or something. Really struggling to picture how that whole situation is going to work.  Unless they're just expecting people to make the transfer using a stop directly on University and Columbia and then walk. Which really decreases the effectiveness of the feeder-spine network in that area."

waterloo,32ivwm,superbad,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:58:43 2015 UTC,"Huh so that does actually exist, I've seen the signs attached to the GRT poles waiting for the 7D but I don't think I've seen the actual shuttle haha.   But what I was getting at with my original question wasn't so much getting around Ring Road, but rather the ease of connections for people arriving on buses from further east/west on the Columbia and University corridors. Someone who works in DT Kitchener coming from Columbia and Erbsville on the 31 or from Bridge and University on the 202 for example. If there's a long walk involved with connecting between Columbia/University and the UW ION station (that being, if the bus stops are directly on the main route) then it's much less likely that someone would take transit over driving.. maybe they could connect to the 7 on King, but that is slower and generally has a lot less appeal to most.  So if the GRT can figure out a way to have buses swing onto Ring Road, connect with the UW station, keep going on a bus-only road over the tracks, and then go back to Columbia/University via north/south on Phillip (and vice versa) without having to loop around and back track the connection would be a lot more attractive. This would also sacrifice less travel time when detouring off the main route."

Someone who works in DT Kitchener coming from Columbia and Erbsville on the 31 or from Bridge and University on the 202 for example.   Based on the current bus routes:  From the 31 or the 201 you can transfer to the 13 which goes around the Ring Road and stops at Davis Centre where the UW Ion station will be.   From the 202 you can get off at University & Seagram stop and walk down Seagram to the Seagram Ion station in Waterloo Park. Only a 5 minute walk, which is not onerous. There has been talk of putting an additional stop at or moving the Philip stop to where the tracks cross University for merely a 3 minute walk down the Laurel Trail. There's also been talk of a Seagram/Albert diversion for some routes to stop right at that station, but there are apparently concerns about the current suitability of Seagram for such traffic without extra construction.   So if the GRT can figure out a way to have buses swing onto Ring Road, connect with the UW station, keep going on a bus-only road over the tracks, and then go back to Columbia/University via north/south on Phillip   What's wrong with coming down Ring Road from Hagey or up from Seagram to the Davis Centre, as several routes already do?

There has been talk of putting an additional stop at or moving the Philip stop to where the tracks cross University for merely a 3 minute walk down the Laurel Trail.    I agree with you that when looked at as a separate entity, those two walks or a potential transfer to another route aren't a huge deal. But when factored into the overall trip, they greatly decrease the attractiveness of transit for someone who isn't already a frequent/dedicated transit user.   For someone who is more of a casual user or is on the fence, that ""transfer penalty"" (which, as per my super scientific (:p) use of the distance measuring tool on Google Maps, is about a 300-350 metre walk for both Columbia/Laurel Trail to UW station and Seagram/Univeristy to Seagram station) would be a massive disincentive to taking transit. Psychologically, it breaks up what could be a seamless transit experience into two trips, and studies show that potential transit users are discouraged.   Take Toronto for example. The TTC has such successful suburban bus ridership (for reasons beyond very frequent service) because of the efficiency of the feeder-trunk system. People can grab a bus on Finch, Lawrence, York Mills, wherever, and ride it directly to a subway station. There, passengers alight into a weather protected area, and then it's a few sets of stairs down and on to a train.   If someone is faced with a snowstorm or 35 degree heat, has mobility issues, or is just tired after a long day at work, that 350 metre walk (or wait time for a Ring Road bus) between an ION station and a University/Columbia corridor bus route becomes a large inconvenience. This discourages transit use and encourages driving.   What's the point of creating such a strong transit spine through the CTC and beefing up parallel bus services in the attempts of creating a trunk/feeder system if the connections that are required to make this system work are poor? People along the ION route will be happy; those on the eastern and western outskirts not so much. That's a massive loss in potential ridership by not having a holistic network view in terms of connections.    What's wrong with coming down Ring Road from Hagey or up from Seagram to the Davis Centre, as several routes already do? It seems to me that would be a useless diversion to send the buses through the Engineering 5 & 6 parking lots over to Philip.   The routes that currently go to DC are either switching direction (7) or terminating/interlining (9/13). Buses like the 201/202 and the rest of the routes on University/Columbia need to keep going in the same direction. In order to do this as the road network currently stands, they would have to go all the way around Ring Road after connecting at the UW station to get back to their route in the proper direction. That adds a ton of time and operating cost, and takes away directness (and UW admin probably wouldn't be too happy with that either).   By adding a bus-only road across the tracks and through the E5/6 parking lots to Phillip, diversions are minimized for east/west buses while network connectivity is strengthened, addressing many of the issues I outlined above. A diversion onto Seagram and then up Lester to connect with the Seagram station, as you said might work if concerns are dealt with, would work well too I think.   As an aside: From what I've seen from your postings here, you've got some great ideas and perspectives, which I really enjoy reading. Keep them coming :)"
waterloo,32ivwm,superbad,2,Fri Apr 17 22:35:40 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this, and was disappointed that the ION stop wasn't put at University Ave. instead of putting it at Seagram.  One stop at University and one at Columbia would make connections a lot more logical, improve station visibility, and acknowledge that non-student persons also ride public transit."

Those are words intended to provoke negative feelings, and if you had no such intent, you had two opportunities to say so and chose to avoid them.   Now kids are graduating undergrad with $50,000 or more in debt   Nobody forces this.  Be assured, you can get a decent job ye olde hard way and it still works.  If you choose to go to university for the education, more power to you.  But that's your choice.   have to pay $200 or more a month for car insurance   This has not changed, other than it tracking with inflation.  FWIW, I'm assuming either an imperfect driving record, or you've under 10 years of experience.  I pay $700 yearly per car (average between the past 4 cars I've had insurance on) at age 35.  I had one car at the very low end of $600 at one point.  Due to a bad driving record, my insurance at ~21 was $7500 yearly, so I certainly can see how $200/month is possible.  I also know that if you keep driving perfectly, you'll be paying similar rates once you've got about 5-10 years of good driving proof under your belt.  The other possibility is that you've just bought a very expensive brand new car.  Yup, insurance on those is very expensive.  Can't say I feel bad in that case, though.  After all, you could afford that car to start with!   and have a $300,000 mortgage to look forward to   This also has not changed significantly when corrected for inflation and household income, however, the expectation of owning a home immediately out of university is a brand new experience that I find rather curious.  Average household income in 1976 was about $12k (based on the $48k in 2011 dollars figure found elsewhere).  Based on the best information I can find, average new home prices would have been about $40k in 1976 (Yes, my parents bought a house just like what I'm living in now about that time for much less.  My home is also worth FAR less than $300,000, even right now.  Yes, it's fully detached---it just isn't a mansion).  $40k is just under 4x the average salary.  A few cites to back up my assertions (I cannot find data specific to K/W on house prices, so forgive me for estimating they'd be significantly lower than this):  http://www.agentinottawa.com/1956_-_Present_Prices/page_491704.html  http://www.torontorealestateboard.com/market_news/market_watch/historic_stats/pdf/treb_historic_statistics.pdf  The average income is over $80k in this region.  $300,000 is just under 4x the average salary.  Cite:  http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/famil107a-eng.htm  The more things ""change"", the more they stay the same.   Don't get me started on the shit job market either.   The job market is doing well in kitchener waterloo.   People will spend an hour on a bus every day if it means that they save money.   I should know.  I did exactly that for several years.

Do you need an eye exam?    sigh   Which is why transit is being improved   Really?  It's to improve the view on it?  It isn't working.  $2b in improvements, and based on everything I calculate, my commute to work will still be about 10 minutes, or 1 hour after they're completed.  The improvements I'm seeing are slated to improve a small strip of land in the centre of a small portion of waterloo region.  I expect the result will be extreme gentrification of the centre of the city, to the detriment of any location that isn't that exact location.  At no point has a satisfactory reason been given how it won't cause that.  FWIW, if you think housing is expensive now, you're going to be in for a shock that you're going to be very angry at.  Housing will be radically expensive near the improved areas of waterloo region, and will only be affordable in the exact places you're going to be unhappy with---the areas that city council forgot."

You'll hit lots of traffic again on 85 North to the universities especially since King is closed in Kitchener, which doesn't help that 85 goes from 4 lanes to 2 in Waterloo.   I don't have a whole lot of patience for traffic and idiot drivers, and I came close to getting in a few wrecks from texting drivers on highway 6. Honestly, I'd find a place to live in Waterloo.

waterloo,32d1o3,CoryCA,2,Mon Apr 13 16:12:27 2015 UTC,I dunno - that one through Sportsworld is often backup up several kilometres out the 401. Or maybe it's just inverse time-dilation from moving so close to 0 instead the speed of light that makes it seem like it adds an extra hour to what should be a 1.5 hour trip. :-)

I was always a little jealous of the cars going the opposite way (coming into Waterloo) in the morning as their drive appeared to less stop and go.. So morning I think would be easier... but as Quock said getting out of KW is a Joke... so after work would be really annoying.     If you have a day off, nothing to do and really want to know.. do the drive in around the afternoon, hang out and then for a bit and start heading back to Hamilton when your job would typically let out...

The environmental assessment is going to take a couple of years for a project this huge, even though it will mostly be about only modifying/upgrading existing tracking. Then you have to get the functional design plans drawn up before you can put it out to contract because while Metrolinx would be a natural operator, the government would need to follow proper RFP protocols and it just might well end up being somebody else. And for those FDPs, it's not just the tracking construction, but also the ancillary stuff, like transit flows surrounding the stations and how that affects linkages to local transit, do overpasses need to be modified, electricity delivery infrastructure.  I'm not a large-scale transport engineer, but I have a a little projectc management training, and with Ion taking 3 years to build, plus the EA and DBFOM contracting process and other non-political lead-up, I can't help but wonder if 10 years for this is on the optimistic side."

Only a pre-feasibility report has been done so far, according to this:  http://www.therecord.com/news-story/5200868-building-toronto-kitchener-london-high-speed-rail-line-unusually-easy-/  There are a massive number of considerations to make for a project of this scale. I'm a little familiar with the EA process and I'd be surprised if it takes less than 4-5 years, due in part to the amount of public consultation they will have to do. The good thing is that there is already a rail corridor and this area is mostly rolling farmland, which makes HSR a real possibility within 10 years."

Also, they still might have to buy land to get rid of some of the curves in the line that would limit the speeds.

The KW area keeps touting itself as Canada's tech hub, but when it comes to paying for infrastructure projects that would make it a really attractive place to own a tech startup or technology business, everyone seems to shy away from doing anything to make Waterloo spectacular.  Things like better and more rapid public transportation, a minimum bike network (at the very least a separated bike lane running down King from Uptown to Downtown), and at the farthest outside, a fiber network, would make businesses want to do business here. Sure, it's gonna cost money, but you have to spend money to make money and to make the city grow."

He says his purpose was to show that cyclists spend just as much as car drivers in Uptown shops.  Maybe so, but the report's first 'key finding' on its very first page states: ""About 70 per cent of Uptown Waterloo shoppers surveyed in this study travel there primarily by bicycle, walking or public transit."" If there's confusion about the report's results, it begins with the report itself.   It's bizarre to me that University profs would fall into this trap of designing a non-random study to study average dollar spend across visitor transportation types, then end up leading with a conclusion that the non-random sample is not random."

I don't think he came away with the right conclusions, though. eg:    Before anyone raises their eyes or busts any myths, however, it's crucial to understand this survey set out to find at least 100 representatives from each of the four main modes of travel. That only a quarter of respondents arrived in Uptown Waterloo by car was part of the survey's initial design, not a result.    ... No, that's not what ""Get to at least 100 in each category"" denotes, unless the students actually stopped counting drivers once they got to 100.   Incidentally, I'm having a very hard time thinking of ways to completely remove sampling bias. Bicycle/Transit use vary so wildly and predictably with demographics, and therefore probably with shopping habits.

Imbibe's owner(s) chose to take on The Boat House, it lead to (my apologies if I'm incorrect) another party coming into the business because of a financial need.  Imbibe expanded without the ability to cover it's original business with such a thing as increased rent (based on proper commercial rates instead of what must be a significant discount)  Why should anyone pay them to re-open elsewhere?  At this point it's a new business venture and so they're asking community backers to float them... to an opening.  What if the business fails anyways, maybe they should open their books to prove that rent is the only thing stopping them from being successful.  I hate to say it, but tell me what significant community or business reason Imbibe has to be saved?  I know of other independent small bars that cater craft brews.. what is so special about them compared to the others who take out loans and work hard to be successful, profit turning businesses?"
waterloo,31x85v,ILikeStyx,3,Thu Apr 9 05:25:47 2015 UTC,"Charity would imply that you're getting nothing back. The money being raised is essentially pre-paying for a future outing at the new location, and provides the business with immediate funds to rebuild.

I've been to Imbibe, it was alright but if someone else came along with their own money and opened something similar, it would honestly be no loss to the community.  My opinion, hover unpopular it might be is that they chose to take on The Boat House and now the original business is paying for that...  Why should I ""invest"" in poor business decisions?"
waterloo,31x85v,baggedlunch,6,Thu Apr 9 12:44:12 2015 UTC,Giving money to a business to help them get up and running is called a loan.   Anyone who gives them money through this campaign better become part owner.

The Waterloo league will be much closer for you and it's a big enough league you can find whatever calibre you're looking for.

I had just finished a night class and was walking home through Waterloo Park along the tracks like I always did. Couple guys wearing leathers and doc martins with colored laces were walking in front of me and stopped at the one way road through the Park. As I walked passed the littlest one asked me for a light. I said I didn't smoke and kept walking up the road towards the tennis club. He followed me and said    ill just take your wallet then...   And I laughed and looked at him and he pulled out a switch blade like in a fucking S.E. Hinton book, no lies. The first and only one I have ever seen in real life. At that point I ran, having no cell phone on me, and luckily there was a couple going for a walk through the Park by the cricket area. Despite also not having a cell phone on them, I had asked while running towards them, when they realized there was a guy chasing me they joined me and the three of us ran to Albert street safely together. But as we ran out the entranceway towards Albert, two waiting skin heads jumped out of the bush but got spooked when they saw that it was three of us not just me, as I'm sure was the plan gone wrong reaction.   As much as we would love to believe, Waterloo has been a fairly dangerous city for a while now. I'm sure if you ask people who attended school here in the early 80's and 90's they will tell you similar stories."

waterloo,31mc2j,CambridgeReporter,11,Mon Apr 6 12:13:36 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see what we see in many European cities. Barcelona is often pointed out as the ultimate in mixed-use zoning that encourages walkability and transit effectiveness.   the bottom storey is stores, restaurants and other businesses that rely on walk-ins without appointments the next storey is businesses that relay on appointments and don't need a store front (health care, accountants, lawyers), or office space that doesn't do face-to-face interactions the third storey is condominiums or apartments   I bet that there's even some businesses that typically end up in light industrial zones which can work in these mixed residential/commercial zones because they aren't as noisy and don't require a high volume of heavy vehicle traffic.  Obviously this should be flexible with multiple storeys per usage class. That way we no longer have solely commercial sectors that turn into ghost towns and people can theoretically walk to work, to dinner, to entertainment, to shopping with a decent variety within a 30 minute walk. (Supplemented by LRT and transit to easily go further without a car.)  Also, while a business generally doesn't need as many square feet for workers as those people need for housing, an all-residential area is just as much a barrier to walkability as an all commercial area is. So while you can have some single-use buildings, you want to discourage them from being built next to ones of the same kind.  So instead of traditional zoning by-laws that divide the city into separate residential, commercial and industrial sectors where the property tax rate is the same for every lot in the sector, you need to have multi-use zoning where the property taxes are dependent upon the building use mixture rather than the zone it is in. For example, A building that has 3 commercial storeys and six residential stories gets a property tax rate of       T = H * Rc * Fc/Fs + H * Rr *  Fr/Fs   Where T is taxes, H is hectares, Rc is commerical rate, Rr is residential rate, Ft is total storeys, Fc is commercial storeys and Fr is residential storeys. It's slightly more complicated but not difficult, and it can be sold to commercial property owners as a rebate on their taxes because residential rates are lower than commercial rates.  Everybody wins! :-)"

It'll be put on the truck, removed, put in storage and later reloaded and delivered. Even with pros, more handling is more risk. With a schmuck company like Mike the mover, expect problems.

Also, let's be honest. Even the consumers who can afford the $10 doohickey - or even the $20 doohickey that lasts 30 years - most of them are not doing that amortization in their heads when they are buying and simply buy what has the cheaper sticker price.

E.g. better build quality on the electric mixers, solid silverware with a proper finish that wouldn't be scratched gone with its first year of use, etc...  It was also more expensive - the mixers seemed to start at the price of a KitchenAid at HBC and silverware was about twice as expensive, though I remember it coming in big lots that I (as a single person back then) would need to split up with others because I'd never need that place settings myself.  However, I know that memory is a fungible thing and I am totally willing to admit that I am misremembering, having unknowingly ""adapted"" those memories with later experience from another field (buying enterprise- and carrier-grade computing and networking gear over consumer-grade gear) that seems at first to be analogously applicable but actually is not."

waterloo,317x6o,uhoreg,5,Thu Apr 2 18:46:01 2015 UTC,"Self-driving cars, when they become widespread, will likely reduce traffic congestion to some degree due to communication and cooperation between cars, but they will definitely not eliminate the congestion problem.  But there are oh so many things wrong with that letter.  It is not an either/or proposition.  We can have both self-driving cars and a functioning mass-transit system.  Having self-driving cars doesn't fix anything for people who can't afford a car (or a second car) in the first place, and will not sufficiently reduce polution.  Street cars aren't comparable to an LRT system, due to limited speed and capacity.  Street cars are more comparable to regular city busses.  The fact that we no longer have street cars does not mean that it was a failure, any more than the fact that we don't use audio cassette tapes any more means that they were a failure.  They both served their purpose for the time, and were replaced with something better.   The light rail transit project is being built, but its future is by no means guaranteed.    The future of self-driving cars is by no means guaranteed either.  Few things in life are guaranteed.  Just because we might have self-driving cars in the future doesn't mean that investing in the LRT today is a bad decision, any more than the fact that we might have teleporters (probably not) or jet packs in the future means that investing in self-driving cars today is a bad decision.  By the way,   One of the students, Lauren Abbot, wants to stay in the car, saying ""When a car is cool, you sit in it forever.""   I could sit in an LRT car forever. ;) (except when the seating is required by someone with limited mobility, of course)"
waterloo,317x6o,shepd,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:07:08 2015 UTC,"I think believing in magic is bullshit as well.  That's why there's proof that self-driving cars can interact with their environment not only to properly improve the flow of traffic, but so they can drive much closer to each other safely.  I remember watching videos of a small stretch of test highway configured for this 20 years ago.  I believe that in 20 years they've come up with many other useful ways to safely add vehicles.  Not to mention that cars have only gotten more compact in that time.  And that's assuming we don't end up with a more useful mini-mass transportation system out of the idea, which doesn't have proof and thus to those not willing to think ahead, probably does seem quite magical."
waterloo,317x6o,youbrainislying,2,Fri Apr 3 16:08:39 2015 UTC,"If you've been paying attention, you've realized that I have not contested the idea that autonomous cars can make traffic more efficient. I totally agree that, when the technology is available, it will make a significant difference. Watching cars drive past at city speeds, it looks like you could fit another whole car in the space a human driver leaves so they feel comfortable. Maybe 2 cars at highway speeds. The lead car broadcasts that it's starting to break and the rest of the cars in the convoy start braking in the same millisecond.  But it is still a future technology and we have congestion-related transit issues now. It is not ""thinking ahead"" to delay solving an existing issue to wait for some hypothetical better option. That's just being stupid.  Also, there's still going to be scalability limits with autonomous cars - you're not going to be able to infinitely pack more and more cars onto the roads. An autonomous vehicle can broadcast that it's about to stop to disgorge passengers, make a left turn, or otherwise engage in activity that would slow traffic and let other vehicles divert to a side street, but at some point you've hit that diversion capacity of those side streets and congestion reappears. There's a maximum number of cars and therefor you will be able to move through a corridor or bring to an area because of that. The line of small cars like a Hyundai ix10 needed to carry 1 full Ion two-carriage train (400 people) would be 100 cars, 410m long (literally bumper touching bumper), stretching along King St. from Erb to William. Assuming that 5 can stop in front of Waterloo town square at a time and passengers take an average of 30s to disembark (mobility-impaired, parents with children, rubberneckers, etc...) all 4 passengers, that's 10 minutes to disembark everybody.  Ion LRT will start running at a 7.5 minute interval, so over 30 minutes it will be able to drop off 1600 passengers compared to 1200 for autonomous cars. Since it has to deal with traffic signals, I'd guess that 3.5 minutes is probably the fastest Ion could run so that would be 8.5 trains in 30 minutes so 3400 people compared to autonomous cars dropping off, again, 1200.  Clearly LRT will be needed for heavy traffic corridors and popular destinations as autonomous cars will simply not be able to handle the necessary volumes."
waterloo,317x6o,RadagastWiz,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:50:41 2015 UTC,"They don't think it will magically reduce congestion, they think it will scientifically reduce congestion.  Traffic congestion is caused by more than just having a density of cars, though that is a pre-requisite. Congestion is caused to a significant degree by sub-optimal driving choices. People going too fast, too slow, being in the wrong lane, cutting people off, making poor logistical choices as to how to get to their destination: all of these factors cause unnecessary ripple effects in the flow of traffic and result in slow downs and accidents.  The idea of self-driving cars reducing congestion is based on the plan that such cars will be able to ad-hoc network with one another, and can work together to ensure each of them is working towards their goal in an optimized fashion.  For example: My car is going to try to make a left-turn 500m from now, in to a parking lot on a busy single-lane street; by broadcasting this intent, the cars behind me might know to turn right and route around a small side street to avoid being held up. Or, the oncoming cars could decide to slow down just enough to give my car a window to make the turn without holding up my lane. A car in the parking lot waiting to turn right on to the busy street could synchronize with my car turning left to smoothly merge in to traffic."
waterloo,317x6o,shepd,3,Thu Apr 2 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"These optimizations are a benefit, certainly. But I still see it as one person per vehicle taking up more space than they need (if used on a consistent basis). Reliable, comfortable, accessible mass transit is still a necessity, in my opinion."

Second, it will be a niche and luxury item for a long time, just like ABS, which was first introduced in 1971 and took 25 years before it was on 50% of all new cars sold in North America. Adding on that the median age of cars on the road in Ontario is 10 years old, this means it's probably 35-45 years before half of all cars on the road are autonomous, which is probably the minimum amount needed to have any significant effect on congestion, assuming the total number of cars would not change.  Because of that time required, if the the number of  vehicles on the road increases at the same rate as it did from 2005 to 2013, in 40 years there will be twice as many cars on the road as today. I'm willing to bet that the increased congestion from doubling the number of cars on the road will be more than the reduction from them being autonomous.  As such, any autonomous, self-driving buses will still be caught in traffic leading to schedule adherence issues, and there will still be a maximum of buses you can push through a corridor dependant on the rate of the traffic signals. And you will still have to have to implement LRT eventually, anyways.  Though maybe if we waited 40 or 50 years, by then we could build a maglev instead of LRT. :-)"

If I take your base claim of 10 years average age and stretch it to it's limits (every car is crushed at 21 years) you are assuming 35 years before self driving cars are available.   No, I said ""probably 35-45 years before half of all cars on the road are autonomous"", not 35 years before self-driving cars are available. It's based on the assumption rate of adoption will likely be the same as that of ABS - 25 years before half of all new cars sold had it, and that that rate of adoption was steady with no jumps or stalls.  I don't know the appropriate mathematical terminology to describe this, so I'll have to describe it visually:  Imagine a series of stacked bar graphs with the bottom colour of the bar being the percentage of cars with the autonomous package, and the colour on top the percentage without. Each bars is the cars sold this year, last year, the year before, and so on, normalized to 100%. For the current year it's half and half. Last year was 52/48, then 54/46, 56, 44,... 96/4, 98/2, 100/0. So if you squish all those vertical bars together and get a a solid rectangle and draw a line from half way up the lefthand side (the 50/50 of the current year) and down along the top of the lower colour it will end on the lower right. That will make a right-angled triangle which is one quarter of the full rectangle and therefore represents roughly 25% of all the cars on the road.  It's not perfect, because those bars of the bargraph on the left actually represent more than 1/25th of the cars on the road and the bars on the right less than 1/25th. There's more year old cars on the road than there are two year old car; more twos thn threes, etc...  but it's still an adequate approximation for our dicussion.  In another 12.5 years, that line creating the right-angled triangle now goes from 75% of the way up on the left site to 25% of the way up the right side, so each side of the line is 50% of the area of the rectangle, and this is, roughly the point when 50% of all the cars on the road have the autonomous feature.  So 5-10 years before it is available, 25 years to 25%, 12.5 more years to 50% pervasive.  5 + 25 + 12.5 = 42.5 10 + 25 + 12.5 = 47.5  Adjust for the previously mentioned bias, that is how I arrived at the 35 to 45 years for there to be enough autonomous cars to actually make a difference.    Because of that time required, if the the number of vehicles on the road increases at the same rate as it did from 2005 to 2013, in 40 years there will be twice as many cars on the road as today Extrapolate how please. If we consider peak driving age to be 20 to 40 years old, data shows that those currently in school are less interested in driving than their parents were. Why would those not interested in driving buy cars, and more importantly, why would they buy them at double the rate?    In 2005 the number of registered vehicles in Ontario is 6.7 million, and by 2013 it was 7.6. That is, roughly a 1.6% year-over-year increase so I extrapolated that across 40 years (6.7 × 1.01640 = 12.6).   Canada's growth rate is 1.2%. You are making the argument that a 1.2% interest rate over 40 years will double the population. Mathematically, you're wrong.   There's your problem. The growth rate of cars on the road is actually greater than population growth rate. And a 1.6% growth rate would take Canada's population from 35M to 66M in 40 years, 70M in 44. Mathematically, I'm correct.   Statistically, more successful populations tend to decline, which isn't supporting your idea.   So then why is our national population still growing? You're just pulling that out of your ass.

Mark Whale  I agree, it is almost unbelievable, which raises question on methodology. Worth noting the sample size is 424 people surveyed semi-randomly over 8 days. Would like to see a bigger sample and better sampling.  Assuming it is true, it'd be interesting to see the absolute visitor counts to the core over time. As it's become less car-friendly, some who previously drove in by car will have switched to an alternative method, but others may have just stopped coming.  E.g. if you made it a car-free zone you'd get 100% of people coming via alternative means but business would suffer from drop in absolute volume."

waterloo,3124lc,mboos,0,Fri Apr 10 23:53:48 2015 UTC,"Do citizens need credentials to weigh in?   Credentials are important. They mean you've been trained in it and have done work in it . So when you say things about it, those listening to you can have some degree of confidence that you know what you're talking about and that any claims you make have decent chance of being correct.  A regular citizen, on the other hand, when they say ""That can' be right!"", what are they basing it on? Their own prejudices and preferred answers, understandings of the topic which might very well be flawed, them thinking they have greater understanding than they actually do. Any number of ways in which they lack knowledge that makes that opinion incorrect or just flat out wrong.  I'm much more scientifically literate than the average person, to the point that I can read the primary research in a field and understand it. For some fields (mostly biology and chemistry) I can even spot flaws that reduce its' strength and likely accuracy that a person of normal (a.k.a. poor) scientific literacy would miss.  I don't know about you, but I don't have the time to educate myself in every topic so at some point I just have to accept what the experts say. And field-relevant credentials is pretty much the most reliable way to determine who is a valid expert to listen to.  So yes, citizens do need credentials to weigh in beyond whether or not they like the conclusions. And when somebody says they question the methodology with the implication that the expert is wrong, I tend to get a little suspicious."

At first blush with the information available, the fact that there are 424 data points captured in 8 days to me doesn't seem like a significant sample to conclude with confidence that such a shift is real, that's why I wondered about the methodology.

There's no guarantee than things  are intuitive, and in fact many things in research end up being counter-intuitive so just because a bunch of people are surprised by something is not really a good metric. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that it is a variation of the argumentum ad populum fallacy and possibly even the worst reason to question the methodology.

Partly because you have been in the core and the number of cars in parking lots tells you 90% seems too high. Partly because a study by the same team just two years ago said 60% of visitors came by car. Partly because there's been a lot of discussion on the topic in the community downtown and business people who talk to visitors every day are surprised by a 90% figure. Factoring all of these things together, to you it might just seem off.  Yet you're saying relying on these instincts/factoids is the worst reason to question the methodology. I say it is a perfectly valid starting point for asking questions about methodology. Not as a ""metric"" or to base a conclusion, but a starting point.  I look forward to understanding from the study why visitor car usage to the core dropped from 60% to 30% in two years. Hopefully it came out of the research or perhaps some follow up research will reveal it. That's why I was interested in whether overall volume dropped - it's one possible explanation for such a big change in transportation mix. For if the volume stayed the same, then it'd be quite a remarkable shift in such a short time.  Totally agree about randomness - Nassim Taleb shows how even the experts are fooled all the time."

If the employer is forced to lay someone off before transferring them, it gives the employee more options, such as going on EI instead of accepting the new job."
waterloo,3129cb,DanLynch,2,Thu Apr 2 11:47:22 2015 UTC,"Makes sense I guess. Though I thought if an employer changes your role materially you can argue it's constructive dismissal in court so still be entitled to severance and EI. I know of someone who had his responsibility materially changed. He went to his employer and said you'd better sever me and give me a package or I'll sue, so they did. If ever in this situation it's important to object early. More here if interested.  It seems pretty normal that an organization of 2000+ people would need to rebalance resources - a re-org of 45 people is pretty small.

So, since this process would be followed, i have no doubts that the impacts have been adequately addressed."

Short Version: No  Slightly Longer Version: No, the park will recoup some of operating costs by running sport leagues (volleyball, soccer, hockey, ultimate, and more).   As well there's a restaurant on site that will be paying rent for the space.  So there's some revenue coming in, however any shortfalls would be cover by the city, which they would have a budget item for ""parks and recreation"" or something of the sort.

I talked with him for maybe 5 minutes at lunch about the topic when I was on site one day.  He did not strike me as greedy or self-centred, but rather as generally a decent if strong willed person who was passionate about his opinion.  The more we invest, emotionally, in a position, the harder it is for all of us to have our ego let us admit that we are wrong, and I got the sense that he had invested enough to make it pretty difficult for him to back down or acknowledge where he might have gotten things wrong.  I also got the sense he was doing it out what he felt best for the community, not some grandiose ego trip for him to become mayor on a tidal wave of anti-LRT support.  For those of you who have seen my comments on LRT her in /r/waterloo in the past, you know that I am strongly for it and that I both disagree with Aissa and feel that his opinions were uninformed malarkey, that his court injunction was done out of pure ignorance, and that he avoided responding on-point critiques during his mayoral run.

The problem is BRT would still be limited by vehicle traffic and the existing roads (unless dedicated roads/lane were constructed - adding to the cost).  In order to get people out of their cars and into transit, it doesn't have to be cheaper, it has to be faster and LRT will be a faster alternative.  As well with LRT you focus a transportation corridor, that more people can physically see (the tracks are there) vs BRT having less of a ""presence"".  With that in mind, it will spawn more dense development along the corridor and help reduce urban sprawl (which is an issue and Kitchener and Waterloo are both rapidly approaching the city limits).     This was all considered during the EA process, with LRT coming out on top.   Obviously it doesn't make sense to trial BRT, then if it doesn't pan out, implement LRT."

K/W just has to be what works best for people here.  I just think that ruling out cars as a mode of transportation is shortsighted and completely ignores not only the multitude of benefits that personal transportation provides, but does so based on facts that change daily.  Cars have never run as clean as they do today, and keep getting cleaner.  Even massive trucks and the ""hated"" SUV pollute much less than ever before and are also becoming cleaner machines with each generation.  Accident rates have decreased steadily since people started caring about safety in the 70s.  We already have very rudimentary self-driving cars on our roads today (lane assist with cruise).  The only complaint that has not been addressed for personal transportation is that it consumes space.  But then again, has it?  Cars have gotten smaller and smaller over the past several decades.  Yes, it is offset by the number that are driven.  The solution is not perfect.  However, based on past performance, I see absolutely no reason to believe that the personal transportation industry as a whole will not bring us to a vehicle model that solves even the ""too many damn cars on the road"" problem."
waterloo,30kicd,shepd,-5,Mon Mar 30 01:51:49 2015 UTC,"Welllll..... I'm not 80, no, but I'm in my 40s. People were still making comments on what a relief it was to have them gone twenty years ago. I think they found old parts of the rail system when they did construction work on King St in Kitchener in the 90s, and it sparked a lot of conversation at the time, young whippershnapper.  I think we need to support an oil free future. Direct transportation, though - from starting point to destination - is not going to go away. People need to get themselves and their stuff where they need to go more precisely than a streetcar can allow.   I think that public transit will largely be replaced by fleets of autonomous electric vehicles in the near future. Except, of course, for our region, because we just spent an insane amount of money on monolithic technology, and we might not be able to afford the better technology as it comes online ~"

waterloo,30kicd,matt_452,-1,Mon Mar 30 01:14:33 2015 UTC,"It's still one person per vehicle, which is the root of congestion.   Ahhh, that's the mistake you're making!  If I were running such a service (and had the freedom to do so, which doesn't exist in K/W, but that's due to laws, nothing more), I would not run it like Uber.  I'd run it to compete full force against bus service.  I'd build something similar to micro-buses with a reasonable complement of seats.  People would use their phones (or whatever else is popular at the time) to tell the service where they want to be, perhaps even when they'd like to be picked up.  Their current location would be tracked (I assume they're walking at the time) and the system would also be tracking those buses.  It would find one that is headed to or past that destination, which is either at or very near the requester's location and tell it to stop there and pick up another passenger.  This provides much of the convenience and speed of a taxi at an extremely reduced cost, and also permits a much higher density of riders.  This is, of course, in the future when self-driving vehicles exist and electric vehicles are the norm.  That system is not easily workable presently due to people driving the vehicles and the current regulatory environment doesn't easily permit such a service.  However, somewhat similar (although fixed) systems such as this have been tried and the idea was popular, though the implementation was poor enough it soured folk on it.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_rapid_transit   Feel free to found yourself a city out in the backcountry of that vastness, but I'd rather keep the prime farmland surrounding us AS farmland.   Unfortunately, you may be right.  As wrongheaded farming methods continue to be pervasive (such as anti-GMO farmland and far outdated organic methods continue) we will need much more farmland to sustain people.  Of course, if we drop all the myths about those things, we would realize that we have enough farmland to sustain more than twice the current human population just with the techniques we know of today."

If there's something I've learned from those that will give their left nut for public transportation, they lack the adventurous spirit that would guide them to what the future can hold.  They believe they've mastered adventure when they spend a day in Toronto, and that they've mastered culture when they take a flight to Rome.  The rest of us know those are to adventure and culture what a Big Mac is to a good steak.  I enjoy adventure.  That's why I drive places.  I can literally stop and smell the roses.  If I wish, my home can follow.  I can enjoy a trip to see the other side of Niagara falls, right now instead of when someone else says I shall (the enjoyment is so much sweeter when only locals will go).  I can drive to places that public transportation has never touched, and then hike to places people have never been.  I can enjoy the culture in areas those who eschew private transportation can never be.  The only disappointment is I can't yet do it with clean electricity, something Ontario is famous for.  But I look forward to being able to do that.  I appreciate that I made a good move and chose an area of Kitchener far enough away from the LRT that nobody here will ever want to use it.  I can be surrounded by adventurers, and for that, I'm glad.  As for my opinion on the LRT---the stage is set.  The seats are all paid for.  Stopping the LRT now holds no value.  I wish it the best, but I am certain it will not turn out the way boosters believe it will and history will repeat itself once users realize the costs are horrendous.  With any luck, the parts of K/W that are not serviced by the LRT will split and solve the issue.  If not, it will be what it will be.  K/W survived the last streetcar fad, it will survive this one."

waterloo,30kicd,BeefJerkyBot,2,Mon Mar 30 19:07:37 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is that it's impossible for someone to both a) own a car so that they can make the choice to drive and go on trips to interesting places, and b) willingly support improved public transit that has higher capacity and doesn't get bogged down in traffic so that they can go to/from work, run errands, go out for the night, whatever it might be, when they don't want to drive. Because anyone who wants options and wants to improve how we travel in the region is a cultureless loser who will never see the world outside of a 500 metre radius of a bus stop. Got it.   The Region isn't eschewing private transportation here. There aren't groups of protesters wanting to abolish cars parading up and down King. The building of LRT is a way to bring the transportation system of KW into a more balanced state where cars don't have to be necessarily relied on unless someone chooses to do so. Cars and the ability to choose to drive aren't going anywhere.  Guess someone needs to tell all the millions of people packed onto the TTC everyday, a large number of which I'm sure are in the ""willing to give away their left nut to improve service"" demographic, that they should just give up trying to get anywhere fast, sell their cars and all that because they're dumb and don't know any better because they don't want to sit in their cars for every trip, just the ones that they choose to use them for."

I don't care about how the 401 is in Whitby, or what new jazz band is playing at elmacombo etc. If the cbc could get out of Toronto centric, they could draw in more people and actually provide a valuable service."
waterloo,30hfb9,taahdlher,5,Fri Mar 27 14:21:58 2015 UTC,"It's important to remember the 89.1 frequency was always a repeater signal of the greater CBC Radio One network, primarily the Toronto station.  When the CBC announced local service expansion, it was to provide a morning radio show and web content. All local CBC signals rely on network programming, some more heavily than others. Kitchener is a prime example of the local in the morning, network shows with locally produced newscasts thereafter.  I think it's fair to say we would all like the CBC to be more than what it is, but it's never going to be, unless it gets properly funded rather than gutted."

Sadly, we're right in the edge of 93.5 from London, so I can only occasionally get the Ontario feed, but it's so much nicer."
waterloo,30hfb9,taahdlher,1 point,Sat Mar 28 12:04:31 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on where you travel. I go through London and down to Windsor every so often, but I get into Toronto a lot more. So if I had to choose I would choose the Toronto feed. 99.1 does not always come in clearly in my car radio. Also, it seems strange that they would feed southern Ontario from Windsor, because you could argue the same thing about it not representing London. Best solution if you can manage it, is listen live through your computer, phone or TuneIn app and then you can pick the frequency and feed as you like."

You don't (or shouldn't) try to arrest anyone, You only arrest people when you have to.   Larkin even mused this year that local charities might want to get in on the action and make some money by setting up food stalls on Ezra to get something other than beer into the students' stomachs. City of Waterloo officials agreed to propose the idea to some service clubs.    Don't you think this would help tame the experience also?   Sure, nothing ""serious"" happened this year.

waterloo,30adss,ShouldBe_Working,5,Wed Mar 25 20:11:44 2015 UTC,"But once you're intoxicated, food doesn't help you sober up any faster. What?    Once it's in your blood stream, it's there until your body finishes metabolising it. Eating food isn't going to change the rate at which that happens."
waterloo,30adss,CoryCA,-1,Thu Mar 26 17:14:18 2015 UTC,"If your drunk, best bet is that some of that alcohol is still in your stomach."
waterloo,30adss,ShouldBe_Working,3,Thu Mar 26 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"If your drunk, best bet is that some of that alcohol is still in your stomach.   Unfortunately not.  80% of the alcohol in a beverage is absorbed in your small intestine rather than your stomach, and just liquids are emptied from the stomach much faster than solid food. On an empty stomach, peak blood alcohol concentration is seen about 30 minutes after consumption, and that can happen only after there is no more alcohol in the small intestine to absorb. That means that beer is out of your stomach and into your small intestine in about 5-10 minutes to be absorbed that fast.  A stomach full of food from a meal, in comparison, doesn't start to empty itself for about an hour and it takes about 2.5-3 hours afterwards to get back down to 50% capacity, 4-5 hours to empty. Drinking while eating slows down alcohol absorption in two ways. The first is by the chewed food sopping it up and holding it along with in the stomach so that it gets released into the small intestine much more slowly. The second way is that the food is a goopy paste at this point, still much more solid than liquid, so it and the alcohol in it gets absorbed more slowly than just liquids. Because the absorption rate is slower your blood alcohol concentration doesn't climb as fast and you don't get as drunk, if at all, as you would for the same amount of beer on an empty stomach.  But that isn't going to happen if you wait more than 15 minutes to start eating. By then, most of the alcohol is in your small intestine and can't be sopped up. By the time the food exits the stomach the alcohol has already been absorbed into the blood stream.  For most people, 0.06 BAC is obviously drunk, and 0.1 is the boisterous,rowdy drunk stage. Two beers finished in an hour with no food will get most people to 0.057 and it will take their body about 2 hours after that peak to get back down to 0.03 which is where most people start to look a little tipsy. Four beers in two hours with no food will get most people to 0.11 and it will take about 5.5 hours to metabolize the BAC down to 0.03.  Even if you're taking it slow and nursing each beer for 30 minutes and then start eating right away after that forth beer, you've already fully absorbed the first three and hit point 0.85 BAC, and a half an hour for that 4th means there' not much of it left in your stomach to make a different from the slowdown in absorption.  That food isn't going to sober you up any faster than not eating."
waterloo,30adss,CoryCA,4,Fri Mar 27 00:23:54 2015 UTC,Eating (or showering or sleeping or drinking coffee) does nothing to change the rate at which your body metabolizes ethanol (about one beer/shot/glass of wine per hour).

That's more than just a little out of hand.  The Ezra street party has a history about getting out of control, and has had that for many years, It's only thanks to pressures like this that they started trying to organize it more and at the very least try to contain it.  As for the revenue comment, how much do you think it cost for the services of 100 police officers and other emergency personnel? I'm guessing it's not covered by those tickets."
waterloo,30adss,CoryCA,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:33:40 2015 UTC,"For the far higher rate of ticketing at the Ezra party to not be a significant part of how to judge it, one would have to show that the WRPS are deliberately going easy on Oktoberfesters and not ticketing a lot who deserve to be as well as deliberately ticketing Ezra St. Patrickers who did not deserve it. That would be very tough to prove and it would be right to be very skeptical of such a claim.  So in that way, I would agree that the people complaining that nobody minds Oktoberfest are making a bad comparison - the Ezra street party is nearly 10 times worse than Oktoberfest when you compare number of tickets to number of attendees."
waterloo,30adss,CoryCA,5,Wed Apr 1 16:58:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, I do think there's officers out there that would pose for a selfie after handing you a ticket.  I don't think it's against the rules.  If they're rushed, probably not.  Why not have people selling food there?  It's easy money and makes everyone present happy.  How is that bad?  Who cares if idiots climb up on houses of their own free will (assuming the owner doesn't care either)?  Don't give me the healthcare waste argument lest I suggest banning skiing as well.

Upgraded the Brantford campus,  built the Milton Campus and  opened the Toronto Campus.

The By-Law is there for a reason, it is there to inform people they are not following the law. That is not your job, it's the by-law officer's job."

When a friend of mine in Guelph got his first car, he didn't drive often and never really took note of the fact that you pull over right. He got a ticket and was apparently completely unaware it was even a requirement. I had to explain to him that there are fewer/no reflectors on the front of your car, so it's far less visible to oncoming traffic, and therefore potentially dangerous. These are the kinds of things that happen when you don't have to follow the normal graduated driving program in Ontario - he had gotten his G1 here, moved to Winnipeg where the MB government gave him a full license, and then moved back to Ontario, where the MTO gave him an equivalent full license.  The guy honestly didn't have a clue, but he's never done it since. A note or warning would have had the same effect.  I remember thinking the wording of the ticket was funny. ""Passenger tires parked more than [something like] 18 inches from the curb"". Yeah, it was the entire road width from that point."

From what I remember. Columbia auto seemed arrogant - maybe that was just back a few years when BlackBerry was all over that area and Columbia had to be booked 4 weeks in advance. It was enough to put me off and go back to the VW dealer. Columbia's prices didn't seem out of touch either - in the end, if you can tolerate the office staff you'll probably be fine.

I would heavily suggest looking at reviews of the agencies though, before going in, because some are shifty.

The whole blackberry ecosystem of apps has a fraction of the number of apps of either android or apple, but to be fair - most of those millions of apps kinda suck anyways.   Anyways, I wish they would change their name back to Research in Motion and actually try to develop other products. Blackberry does kind of feel like a dead-end."

Lock out the 'business' side and wipe any locally stored data belonging to the company :)  And their BES12 service is now going to the cloud which should provide for SMB's that can't afford their own BES in-house.

The bb app store should be eradicated and totally replaced with Android, but otherwise, nice phone for the form factor. The passport has been calling my name as a note 3 user. So I think people have projected negative work emotions on to the brand - a real liability for enterprise focused bb."

waterloo,2xznfy,Quock,3,Fri Mar 6 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"It depends on whether youd have to shovel it if you owned it, generally. Townhouses usually have a property manager that does all the grounds maintenance which includes mowing in the summer and snow-clearing in the winter, so rent or own, you don't shovel the public sidewalk even if your row faces it directly.  Renting a regular house, though, almost always means you have to shovel just as if you owned the place. Those older houses in Waterloo that are rented out to students and a few in a row are all owned by the same corporation, I've heard of a few of them where the corporate owner comes by with a snowblower & a bag of salt, but I've never heard of that happening when it's just a single house."

But this person makes claims of households having to pay $1000 a year for the LRT, but since the property tax increase is 1.1% that means they were already previously paying $100k, which is clearly bullshit.

While manufacturers do get sloppy with specs, your goal is to get the highest gain antenna you can which doesn't require any sort of ""booster"" or ""amplifier"".  Amplifiers are only useful on antennas if you have a long cable run (100 feet or more).  In fact, they otherwise will lower the amount of signal you will receive as they add noise.  You'll definitely need a rotator, or you'll have to pick a tower to point at.  As you increase gain, your antenna becomes more and more directional.  If you specifically are interested in towers broadcasting from Toronto, you could do without the rotator and point in that direction.  You won't receive signals from other towers, though, which is why a rotator is handy.  TV Fool will tell you which direction you'll need to point your antenna.  Digiwave is a cheap brand of antenna, and tend to have somewhat inflated specs.  However, they're plentiful and they do work, just not as well as advertised.  Plus the prices are decent.  So you could do worse...  :)"

Depending on where you live, you should be able to get Toronto, and potentially Buffalo, but to do so requires more than just a set-top antenna, you'd need something mounted outside with a preamp.

waterloo,2xucbo,ThunderSteaks,2,Wed Mar 4 02:45:54 2015 UTC,"There wouldn't be any fire safety issues for the landlord with this because they should have the documents already setup.  As long as a bedroom is being used as a bedroom it doesn't matter how many people are in it (within typical reasons - 3 kids sharing a room, not unheard of, 4 adults... ya not as common).     However, landlords do need to report the names of people living within a building for both insurance and safety needs.  (which I guess would also be fire safety).   However, the landlord ""shouldn't"" have any concerns.  I rent a property out with 3 adults and 3 kids, and I wouldn't have any issues with adding more, provided that they use the bedrooms as indicated on the fireplan/floorplan."

In a capitalistic environment, precious damn few and most of them like GrandLinq only with government money which essentially makes them ""government"" rather than non.  Yes, people who won't use it (or will rarely use it) will have a say in it, via their votes. I don't drive, but I have a say, through my vote, how roads are built. But I don't say the the government is the wrong organization to run where and when and how the roads get built. Instead I understand that huge infrastructure projects like that are best managed by a long-lived organization that doesn't have a profit motive.

If it's mainly furniture you need moved, you might try this company http://furniture-movers.net/ They are on the affordable side and operate throughout the U.S. & Canada. One thing I'll recommend, in addition to my recommendation, is to feel out a couple movers before making a decision--then look them all up to verify licensing and insurance info.

waterloo,2x5nxc,taiko-kun,3,Wed Feb 25 21:25:30 2015 UTC,"In the email update I got, there was this tidbit:  ""Watch for public information sessions later this year on the transit project assessment process for Stage 2 LRT to Ainslie Street transit terminal. ""  That means for the Cambridge segment we're roughly at the point where we were at in April 2011 for the K-W segment: route chosen, second public consultations about to start.  This would mean that, hypothetically, construction could start as early as 2018 if everything else were to proceed at that same pace.  Much of the work that was done for the K-W segment is applicable to the C segment, such as the work done to decide upon the DBFOM method of procurement and any necessary regional legislative amendments needed. Alse, I think the environmental assessments were done all the way down to Ainslie so I don't believe they will need to be repeated.  The only thing I see that could slow things down is acquisition of provincial and federal funding.  However, the Tories back in 2009 jumped on providing funding mere days after the Region had approved the plan to build an LRT and promised $160M before even a route selection had been made or the Region had applied for funds. A year later, the federal commitment was $265M and that increased support was maintained even after they gained a majority in Parliament and didn't need to cater to swing ridings like us any more. As such I don't think it's unreasonable to assume a similar funding commitment for the C-segment.  The provincial Liberal government back in 2009 had initially promised 2/3rds funding, but that was cut to 1/3rd when the final commitments were announced in 2010. However, since then in two provincial elections since then, the Liberals have promised increased public transit spending, especially for rail projects and have made good on those promises as indicated by the very strong push to acquire the tracks for GO and prepare them for electrification. As such, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a commitment closer to 2/3rds than 1/3rd for the C-segment.  All in all, I think this bodes well for those who have said that the C-segment will never get built being proven wrong."

waterloo,2wjdx2,cutbigfoot,6,Fri Feb 20 13:05:42 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure the school board is more concerned that parents sometimes don't prepare their kids to be outside (walking to school/standing at the bus stops)  when it is this cold out.
waterloo,2wjdx2,youbrainislying,16,Fri Feb 20 13:51:23 2015 UTC,"Not every child has the benefit of a family that can afford to purchase sufficiently warm clothing for such temperatures, or the wisdom to recognize when they are necessary. And because many people also treat school like it is some sort of coat-check system where they deposit their inconvenient child for storage for several hours, people frequently send kids to school when they are ill, when they should in fact be kept home to rest. You combine the two factors and you have a recipe for serious health risks.  Plus, given that a small child literally froze to death a few days ago in Toronto has administrators exercising extra caution.  Your personal inconvenience is unfortunate but it's the lesser of potential evils."

It's not a matter of personal inconvenience. If they closed the schools this often in the 70s when I went, I'd probably still be in school. The criteria should be as follows: Board calls city. ""Is GRT running today?"" ""Yes"" Schools are open, busses are running. Outside of town is a little different given that the weather is almost invariably worse. But in the city, that's how it should be."
waterloo,2wjdx2,youbrainislying,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:05:31 2015 UTC,"Hats, mitts and scarves are available at Dollarama, among many other like places.    A fact that is, sadly, of zero use at 7:30am when your 6-year old's schoolbus is 5 minutes away and you cannot find her hat or gloves, which have vanished overnight.    if you as a parent don't know enough to make your kid wear them in this kind of weather, well, sorry, but you probably shouldn't have had kids in the first place.   Which is perhaps true, however we can likely assume people who lack the wisdom to properly raise children, would also lack the wisdom to know they should not have had those children.  Another reasonable assertion would be, if you lack the personal or financial stability to accommodate disruptions to your schedule in order to care for your child, you probably should not have had a child.   The problem with both of these assertions is that they are hollow quips, of no practical use to children who are already alive. Looking down our noses at the minority of parents who are ignorant or inattentive doesn't actually help keep their kids safe. If your stance is that extreme cold weather doesn't actually pose a health risk to small children, then I suggest you obtain a job with Environment Canada and order new studies of the effects of cold weather on physiology, since the school system bases its decisions on EC's recommendations.  The Transit system being operational (And when it comes to the GRT I use the term 'operational' rather loosely) is certainly not the same thing as being a sign it is safe for kids to be out and about with minimal to no supervision. Adults possess a degree of agency and self-sufficiency which children lack. If you are outside and get too cold waiting for a bus, you are free to go find a Tim Hortons somewhere, buy a coffee, and warm up. If you lose your gloves in the middle of the day you have the means to go buy a new pair before going home. If you are sick, you can choose to stay home in the first place - no one will pick you up, shove you in a coat and bustle you out the door despite your protestations."

waterloo,2wiil2,idahobucharest,3,Fri Feb 20 04:21:52 2015 UTC,"Kind of silly.  HydroOne has those charges because it got saddled with debt and needs to pay it.  While I agree it shouldn't be broken out as a separate line item (but rather integrated into the cost of the service), the bottom line won't change whether it's on the bill or not.  All the other line items are there because of the same reasons:  The government says electricity will cost X cents per kilowatt, but there's no way to charge that without going broke.  Rather than close up shop (Like they do in Venezuela when faced with such contradictions) the utility instead reacts a little more honestly by doing what is requested, and then separating out all the charges.  As for HST, sure, why not have it removed.  I'm not going to argue that, except that it's a pipe dream to think the government will give up on free money.  I don't find the smart meters any more faulty than the other methods Hydro used to investigate how much electricity you've used.  In fact, I find them more accurate and less prone to customer abuse.  What you need to be asking for is Kathleen Wynne to stop acting like Hugo Chavez, and let the utility figure out what it really needs to bill to provide service to customers (of course, you will not save money, but you will have an electric price that resembles reality so you can properly figure out what your bill will be on your own).  You also need to separate out the meter issue, because many people agree with me that the smart meters aren't an issue and won't bother joining a protest that includes them.  I'd also recommend not bothering with the HST request because it isn't going to happen, the governments like their money more than that; however, that isn't likely to stop someone from agreeing with you."

waterloo,2wbred,apostate_of_Poincare,6,Wed Feb 18 16:48:47 2015 UTC,"Hi, it's also pretty straight forward here. First, you'll want to negotiate who should take care of the expense of an emissions and safety test and any repairs that are needed as a result. After you get a pass on both tests, you'll create a Bill of Sale, which should details things like the make, model and year of the car as well as current KMs. and conditions about warranty and repair or whatever else you want to add. There's a template you might want to check out here: http://www.lawdepot.ca/contracts/bill-of-sale/?loc=CA.  In Ontario, the plates stay with the owner, so the buyer will have to transfer or get new plates in their name. They take the Bill of Sale and cert. results to the Ministry of Transport Ontario and register their new vehicle, paying HST at the same time. One other thing: you give the VEHICLE portion of your registration to the new buyer, but keep the PLATE portion.   Maybe someone else can chime in whether or not you also need the Used Vehicle Information Package to give to the new buyer. I've heard this can be skipped, but I might be wrong."
waterloo,2wbred,fart_knuckler,2,Wed Feb 18 17:04:07 2015 UTC,"UVIP is skipped when buying from a licensed dealer (the local auction house is a licensed dealer), buying a new car, when parting a car out, or when selling the car to a junkyard.  Those are the only cases I can think of.  Selling the car as-is does not get you out of UVIP."
waterloo,2wbred,shepd,2,Wed Feb 18 18:51:52 2015 UTC,There are some good government links that explain the buying and selling process. Most buyers will want you to foot the cost of the safety and emissions testing (you may luck out with someone opting to pay for it - but its unlikely) (http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/vehicle/used.shtml#selling)
waterloo,2wbred,Samanthangel,2,Wed Feb 18 17:29:42 2015 UTC,The used vehicle information package will be necessary along the with the items posted below. This documents the taxes owing by the new owner when they accept ownership of the vehicle. These taxes are calculated based on the current blackbook value of the vehicle.  good luck!
waterloo,2wbred,meadeater,2,Wed Feb 18 18:27:29 2015 UTC,Remember that the buyer pays HST on the total listed on the bill of sale.
waterloo,2wbred,shepd,1 point,Wed Feb 18 18:34:55 2015 UTC,"And that if you make a fake bill of sale (or just forgo one entirely), if it's too far out of whack, the buyer will instead pay whatever the government thinks the car is worth.  That can be fought by using an licensed appraiser, but it will cost you more than it's worth (except, perhaps, if you're selling a relatively new but mostly trashed Ferrari)."
waterloo,2wbred,shepd,2,Wed Feb 18 18:50:37 2015 UTC,"Your minimum cost is the UVIP, which is $20.  You may also want to have the car safetied (Generally under $100 + whatever you get to fix--you may fix the broken stuff yourself and bring it back shortly after for a discount re-safety).  The safety will last for 30 days, so many will instead have a mechanic check the car over for whatever needs fixing to pass safety (for a fee) and then have that quote handy for the buyer.  The buyer may wish for you to have the work done first at your expense.  That's up to you.  Depending on the age of the car and type of car, it may need an emissions test.  That will generally cost under $50 + whatever needs fixing, if something does.  If you don't have a check engine light right now, you'll probably pass emissions.  Check your car:  http://www.downloads.ene.gov.on.ca/files/driveclean/onesite/en/ldv_when.asp  Used vehicles sold without valid emissions tests (not required is valid) or without a valid safety, or neither may still be sold.  The buyer will purchase the vehicle as ""UNFIT"".  He'll be allowed to get temporary plates if your car is presently FIT (if you're driving it legally, it is) and can then drive the vehicle home to repair it, to an emissions centre, or to a repair shop for repairs/safety.  Once the temporary plates are expired (14 days?), they will no longer be able to drive it and must present a valid safety certificate and possibly emissions test to get a permanent plate.  Or they may choose to keep the vehicle off the street until they get those done (would need to be towed to get a safety at a minimum).  Due to that most buyers want a safety and emissions done already.  But they are not required for sale and if you've dealt with temporary plates before and can do basic repairs yourself, it's a better value for the buyer if they can instead get a discount on the car without them.  I've almost never seen a car get a pass for brakes on a safety inspection, so any car I buy, I also get a set of brand new cheap brake pads ($50) (and, if it looks necessary, rotors, $100) and slap those on before I take the car to be inspected.  Most other stuff people will generally keep in good shape if they care about their car, but brakes... I don't know why, but even people who care about their cars ignore them.  Easy DIY job, too."

waterloo,2wbred,shepd,1 point,Thu Feb 19 03:21:16 2015 UTC,"Emissions testing can be done up to 1 year (minus a day?) in advance.  Once the car passes, it's good until the car requires another emissions test (2 years).  So you should be fine.  However, look the car up to be certain it needs one.

The blowers shown in the video are awesome no doubt, but even the best operators can only run them for so long before the shear pins snap, and amateur operators are lucky to get 20 minutes out of a set of shear pins.   The alternative is blades, which the city has on their trackless MTS, decent little machines but they're too light to push some of the bigger plowins and drifts.  Even worse running these blades in float, which is the only plausible way of doing that much sidewalk leaves a layer of smooth, hard packed snow that is pretty much ice.

I'd guess that a third to fully half of my walking in residential areas has to be done on the road because the sidewalks are well nigh impassable even more than the 24 hour grace period after a snow fall.

Things to consider:      Depending on the road a sidewalk falls on, it is maintained by a different level of government. Municipal, Regional, and Provincial would all need their own local equipment / employees. The machines will have to be purchased and maintained, as well as, more seasonal staff employed and paid. What happens when it doesn't snow? These machines are still sitting around and the staff are still being paid.  Want all sidewalks cleared within 24 hours of a snowfall? Then you'll need a considerable fleet of sidewalk plows and several staff to run them.  A sidewalk plow does not clear the snow as well as a human does. They often leave an inch of debris that turns into a slippery slush. Since people are no longer expected to clear the sidewalk, your entire walk is through this stuff instead of every several house.  The plow simply pushes the snow into driveways. While the home-owners work load may be reduced a bit, it's not by much.  Staffing is often greatly reduced on weekends."
waterloo,2w71uc,dreamsofflying,2,Wed Feb 18 15:09:22 2015 UTC,"I get that it's hard, especially for some less able bodied.  I also get that it sucks as a pedestrian to walk though unplowed sidewalks.   However, as a homeowner you take on these kind of responsibilities when you purchase a home. If you really can't do this consider an apartment building.   What's next, getting the city to water your lawn?   Cities sometimes have trouble plowing all the residential roads, to do sidewalks too during snowstorms would be a huge drain both in resources and money. Especially if the city has to contract out the work.   My advice is to buy a $500 snowblower. That and a shovel to clean up what's left should bring your time down to 10 minutes or less."
waterloo,2w71uc,Badrush,16,Wed Feb 18 20:54:10 2015 UTC,"$500 snowblower / $7 per year = Better get 72 maintenance free years before you have your value out of it.  Heck, you want to shovel the entire thing to save money?  Better get 3 years out of your shovel to break even.  We could have wells and septic systems.  But despite how ""high"" your water bill is, ask a friend out in the country how much they spend keeping their septic system decent, how much fun it is to buy the ""right"" toilet paper (nowadays it's easier than it used to be) and how much they spend on bottled water because their well just isn't good enough to drink from.  I don't like the city spending money on stuff, but I do recognize a good value when I see it.  :)  Snowplowing sidewalks is like your city water:  It's just way cheaper that way."
waterloo,2w71uc,shepd,8,Wed Feb 18 01:16:07 2015 UTC,The city should just give out snow shoes.
waterloo,2w71uc,Brave_Cosmonaut,-2,Tue Feb 17 17:12:54 2015 UTC,If people really want the city to do the shovelling then the homeowners as a whole should be willing to all pay an extra fee to cover the costs.
waterloo,2w71uc,Badrush,9,Tue Feb 17 17:18:26 2015 UTC,Maybe we could call those fees 'taxes' or something fun like that...
waterloo,2w71uc,the_pw_is_in_this_ID,-1,Tue Feb 17 17:58:45 2015 UTC,City taxes are all allocated for already. If no new taxes are implemented then other services will have budget cuts.
waterloo,2w71uc,Badrush,2,Tue Feb 17 21:10:35 2015 UTC,And I would happily pay my part of the requisite new taxes.
waterloo,2w71uc,the_pw_is_in_this_ID,2,Tue Feb 17 21:19:15 2015 UTC,"Easy fix to that, no wage increases for Council. I used to work full time for the city of Burlington, a number of times over the last several years their council agreed to a wage freeze to reduce tax increases so they could continue to provide all their services without cuts. All it takes is a responsible municipal government, unfortunately Kitchener/Waterloo seems to have a very irresponsible municipal government that pisses away tax dollars willy nilly on useless projects which have absolutely no benefit."

waterloo,2vz03r,thelatestmodel,7,Sun Feb 15 15:25:28 2015 UTC,"Bell, Teksavvy, Rogers, Start.ca... There are plenty. All of them offer >100mbps options. As good as Google fibre? Not even close. But better than the barely better than dial-up speeds Olds had before they implemented their own network. Understand they put it in because they had no other choices. They are a small town and weren't going to get an infrastructure upgrade forever until they did it themselves. Kitchener-Waterloo is a huge urban area and has plenty of providers. No municipality in their right mind would pay to upgrade services they already have. High speed Internet in Waterloo isn't great, but it's present, which is the difference between us and Olds."
waterloo,2vz03r,loercase,5,Sun Feb 15 15:53:05 2015 UTC,"Teksavvy, Start.ca etc... only resell Bell xDSL or Rogers cable internet.  Also, please tell me where in Waterloo Region you have found better than xDSL 50/10 or cable 60/10 offered. The Bell VDSL 175Mbps package is only available in a few select places in Toronto, as is the Rogers cable 200Mbps."
waterloo,2vz03r,CoryCA,2,Sun Feb 15 20:34:42 2015 UTC,"CoryCA, I had Rogers 250/20 service. Rockway area of Kitchener. It's definitely available in this area."
waterloo,2vz03r,shiftee_uk,1 point,Sun Feb 15 21:12:46 2015 UTC,"You're right. I checked, and the 250/20 is available since about a year ago in K-W area.  This means they opened up more than 4 downstream DOCSIS3 channels for our area which means they did some serious upgrading. (1 DOCSIS3 downstream channel is ~40Mbps.)  Though in typical Rogers fashion that still doesn't appear to be available to the resellers like TekSavvy & Worldline can't get that. (When worked for Fibernetics, we hired a directory away from Rogers to give us an in to resell residential internet, because even though the CRTC said they had to, just like Bell, they made it damn near impossible for anybody to do so.)"
waterloo,2vz03r,CoryCA,2,Mon Feb 16 22:59:53 2015 UTC,Victoria Commons new development can get any of Rogers or Bell's fiber lines. I currently have 50/50 mbps and it's solid. 175/175 is available but I have a 1 year free contract for the 50/50.

I used order and set up stuff like that for business customers when I worked at Fibernetics. Minimal set-up fees (and by minimal I mean less that $1000) if you were in a connected building, but usually you had to have the fiber trenched in from the road and that was usually $2000+. Even more if it had to be brought in from a few blocks - $5000 was not uncommon. The Fibernetics HQ near Fountain & Maple Grove was, IIRC, $20k+."
waterloo,2vz03r,CoryCA,1 point,Mon Feb 16 21:22:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Also, I am on Laurel St. in uptown and am an Acanac customer. I get 5Mbs down and 1Mbps up. That's the best Bell told me they could give me because I was so far away from their connecting point.  The Internet situation in this region is what I would call ""good."" It's not very good, it's not excellent, but most of the time it's available and fast enough for me to do my work."
waterloo,2vz03r,Rocky1138,1 point,Sun Feb 15 23:47:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that area is a bit of a hole for xDSL service. I remember having Fibernetics customers near there that had similar speeds on ADSL. However, I contracted for a bit for a business on Peppler a year ago, and they were able to get 50Mbps cable service, so I would check a company like TekSavvy or VMedia or Start to see what they can do for you for that."
waterloo,2vz03r,CoryCA,1 point,Mon Feb 16 21:29:50 2015 UTC,I used to have 150/10 from Teksavvy near Grand River Hospital before I downgraded because I didn't want to pay $100/mo anymore.
waterloo,2vz03r,stevedore,1 point,Mon Feb 16 00:03:35 2015 UTC,"I believe they also resell the fibre laid by whatever subsidiary company KW Hydro created to as part of a previous initiative.  Frankly, I'm happy we have choice here.  I would be very sad if the city took that away from us."
waterloo,2vz03r,shepd,1 point,Mon Feb 16 20:31:30 2015 UTC,"You're thinking of Atria networks, which was the company created in 2005 t by the KW Hydro, Waterloo North Hydro, Guelph Hydro and others to run/sell the dark fibre networks they created in the 1980s & 1990s. They were bought by Rogers in 2011.  I don't doubt that TekSavvy and others resold it, just like we did at Fibernetics, to business customers. 100Mbit here in K/W from them cost $1100/month plus dig/trenching and other install fees. Except for already connect buildings I never saw a connect fee of less than $1000, and many $5000 ones and even multiples of $10k."

waterloo,2vz03r,ILikeStyx,1 point,Mon Feb 16 21:49:48 2015 UTC,"In addition to that fact we do have high speed (although slower than Google Fiber), cost I think we would the biggest issue. Based on the figures from the article 14 million for 8000 people.  This is the break down for K/W, and the region: *Kitchener:  $358,750,000.00 *Waterloo:  $171,500,000.00 *Region of Waterloo:  $985,250,000.00    This assumes it would cost as little as 14m per 8000 people, which I highly doubt is the case.  As that town is likely very spread out and not developed like most of the region."
waterloo,2vz03r,thunderchamp,3,Sun Feb 15 20:10:40 2015 UTC,That's not unreasonable over the course of a few years for an entire region to come up with.  Plus once all that fiber is laid down it's good for a very long time.   Return on investment would be the issue. They would have to compete with rogers and bell for customers.
waterloo,2vz03r,Endactam,4,Sun Feb 15 18:28:02 2015 UTC,"Right. the Region is going to come up with a billion dollars to lay fibre to everybody's home. Did you miss the screaming about the $860M for the LRT?  Whether fibre or copper, laying those loops to homes is damn expensive, thousands of dollars per kilometre and I can't begin to imagine how many klicks of line you'd have to lay to reach every home in Waterloo, let alone all of the tri-cities. This would be a project taking decades."
waterloo,2vz03r,CoryCA,2,Sun Feb 15 19:57:35 2015 UTC,It does not matter what the initial investment is if the return on investment is good.  Could fiber for the whole region make money?  Probably not.
waterloo,2vz03r,Endactam,1 point,Sun Feb 15 20:52:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, won't have fibre everywhere. We have copper loops everywhere, mostly from the Bell Central Offices (e.g. Water St & Fairway Rd. in Kitchener, Albert St. in Waterloo). In the last 10 years Bell putting in remote DSLAMs and hooking the neighbourhoods through them instead of all the way back to the CO, but they only came on-line in about 2009 in the Region and were not available to resellers until ~2011. The areas where you can get actual ""fibre to the home"" in Waterloo Region are very tiny."

Heck, to be honest, almost nobody in Canada bought over $300 because China was doing most of the insane investing.  Plus with Mt. Gox ripping people off, things were going to be crazy.  It's in its infancy, so there's going to be swings.  I'd never say it's a solid investment like a GIC, it's going to be risky.  But the losses have been nothing compared to the gains over the long term.  And most people aren't buying a GIC to see what the payout will be in a few months.  They're buying one to see what they payout will be in 3-5 years.  Gotta compare apples to apples.  I suppose it's up to the individual to decide if they're going to day trade (in which case, well... you'd better be a pro) or if they want to put in a few hundred dollars and see how things are a few years from now."

waterloo,2vwzyi,da_corn,7,Sat Feb 14 22:41:02 2015 UTC,"I just switched to Wind, coming from 5 years with Bell. The two changes I notice are:   1) Service is more likely to drop in places like basements and underground parking garages. There's one university lecture hall that I no longer get service in.   2) Download speeds are slower. The speed on wind is 100% fine for email, web browsing, and music streaming. If you want to stream a lot of video, you will probably run into issues with buffering.   So the service on wind isn't perfect -- but it's fine. My bill dropped from $95 to $45 a month. As a student -- worth it for me.   You can try wind for 10 days I think, maybe worth trying."
waterloo,2vwzyi,Bentechnical,2,Sat Feb 14 23:17:56 2015 UTC,I agree with this person.  I switched about 2 weeks ago and the best comparison is like when phones were gaining popularity in the 2000's and coverage wasn't perfect.   For $45 bucks a month I'm fine  with that.  So far I get shitty service around the Sportsword drive area and that's all I've found as of yet.
waterloo,2vwzyi,SoupMuffin,3,Sun Feb 15 00:10:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can confirm Sportsworld area is terrible. Northwest Waterloo is awful for me too (Ira Needles new commercial development). Everything else for me has been great, though I've heard Breslau is not quite what their coverage map shows. I actually get stronger signal with Wind in my Kitchener basement apartment than I did with Bell or Rogers - I borrowed a Wind SIM card, went home and ran a signal strength application on a couple of my phones, and compared dB levels.  Going west on the expressway out towards Stratford, you get signal past Trussler. Out the 401E I think it's solid all the way to Toronto. If you can deal with emergency-only coverage (or WiFi-only, so no calling+texts) outside the proper coverage areas, Wind's value is untouchable."
waterloo,2vwzyi,Thorlius,2,Sun Feb 15 05:21:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed with the coverage issue, outdoor coverage is great but sometimes it gets block in buildings, especially very old buildings.  This is the case when I was living in Toronto as well, there was one restaurant I would go to, you stand near the door it's full signal, walk 3M into the middle of the room and lose everything.  As someone else mentioned, there is a particularly large dead zone between KW and Cambridge though, in around the Sportsworld area.  My wife and I hit it when we go out for dinner and movies.  Not agreeing on the download speeds though.  That's part of my workout routine: set my phone to tether, connect my tablet, watch Netflix in glorious tablety HD for a 20 minute treadmill run.  Multi-megabyte apps are downloaded in seconds.  Netflix recommends 5Mbps for HD content and speedtest.net tells me I'm getting 9.77 (with spikes upwards of 11Mbps) which corresponds with my personal experiences, never had a buffering problem.  Not sure what'll happen if I exceed the 5GB limit though: I only get about 2 hours a month in keeping me just under the limit.  Maybe that's your problem?

Orange areas are spotty, with coverage not being good (ie I find it hard to get a signal near the boardwalk). Everything else you aren't getting a signal or you will need to connect to another network. The cost of using the other networks has come down significantly recently.  Rule of thumb.

waterloo,2vwzyi,BexterV,1 point,Sun Feb 15 03:50:48 2015 UTC,"I had Wind for about two years, it's definitely improved in that time. Like other comments, coverage tends to fade when you're in in a basements and what not. Internet speed is not stellar, but better than the EDGE service I had with my previous phone on Rogers. I can't say what their customer service is like as I never had to use it. My Wind phone was a Nexus 4.  The corridor between here and Toronto is pretty well covered, with the exception of the Cambridge section of the 401. Their coverage out in the boonies (St. Jacobs, Elmira and beyond) is non-existent, though Rogers Roaming is OK -- so long as your phone is setup to disable Data when you go out of your coverage areas.  I always had decent reception in town between North Waterloo (Northfield area) to about the Waterloo Region Museum in the Kitchener/Doon area to South Kitchener (past Forest Heights and Westheights).  I'd highly recommend trying Wind if you stick around town or your main travel is between here and TO. Can't go wrong with $40/mo (at the time was their best plan). I'm only on Bell now because it's a work phone ;)"

waterloo,2vwzyi,shepd,-2,Tue Feb 17 17:20:18 2015 UTC,"Wind for a few years here. Paying 30 bucks per month for unlimited data and calling and all that is quite nice.  EDIT: This is from the original promotion when they first came in to town. Not a normal price.  However. The service is absolute garbage. I have yet to have a single call to their support line end without me talking through my teeth trying to keep my composure from frustration. You cannot get support in-store, all they will do is give you the support phone number (or some employees will be kind enough to call for you if they aren't too busy).  There is also a rather large dead zone between here and Cambridge if you take the GRT between the towns at all. Coverage is decent aside, but not perfect. I did not get coverage at all in the house I lived in near St Mary's hospital, whereas across the street was fine.   I did also have an issue recently when purchasing a Moto G from Wind (Fairview location). The employees continuously tried to say they didn't have them, until one newer girl went back and found two. She brought one out to show us, said she had two in the back, and her boss(?) was mad saying she HAD to sell the phone to us now that we'd seen it and that he wouldn't sell both to us since we'd only physically seen one of them.  I got my phone that day, but my husband had to come in the next week when they got a shipment in and argue with them to get them to sell him one that day too, thankfully their regional was in the store at the time and made sure the phone was sold to us with little complications.  TL;DR: The phones are good, the price is great. But in return you'll have to deal with phone-only support and the occasional reception hiccough."

waterloo,2vpps5,bigpilague,5,Fri Feb 13 01:02:12 2015 UTC,"A lot of times the intention is also to divert traffic away from the 'calmed' roads to routes that are intended to be arterial.   The same thing is happening with King in Uptown, part of the redesign is to make the street more bike and pedestrian friendly--part of it is to stop people from using King as a cross-town route and get them to Weber where they should be.

waterloo,2vpps5,raw-deal,1 point,Fri Feb 13 02:31:00 2015 UTC,"Heh, they did something similar on Highview drive, but didn't change the speed limit.  It's now less safe as you have some drivers who are driving deathtraps (or they're morons) that will clearly disintegrate if they take a speedbump over 5 km/h, and everyone else driving safe vehicles that can take them at the speed limit.  Remember:  You can't have an accident without a difference in speed.  The city shouldn't be trying to introduce dramatic differences in speed in a residential area, it's crazy."
waterloo,2vpps5,shepd,1 point,Sat Feb 14 03:14:22 2015 UTC,"Highview drive in kitchener is a packed residential street and honestly even 50km is probably too fast. And like OP pointed out, when you have a posted limit of 50, people will drive '50winkwinknudgenudge60or70' unless you force them to slow down with traffic calming measures."
waterloo,2vpps5,raw-deal,1 point,Sun Feb 15 00:40:34 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, though. The traffic calming has only resulted in high speed differentials, not an overall slowdown. Bringing the average down doesn't help if it's only due to a select number of drivers significantly bringing down their speed causing panic braking from most others."
waterloo,2vpps5,shepd,1 point,Sun Feb 15 17:54:08 2015 UTC,"It probably results in some people going 50 over the speed bumps and some people going 5 over the speed bumps, but nobody going 70 all they way down the street.   If you're panic braking because someone has slowed down or is driving slowly in front of you, you probably need to slow down in general."
waterloo,2vpps5,raw-deal,1 point,Sun Feb 15 21:27:11 2015 UTC,"Heh, I don't need to panic brake as I drive a stick shift.  The trouble is, the design of the road, being that it could support 4 lanes of traffic and is rather straight, lulls people into not paying attention.  So a downshift into first gear and the accompanying engine braking consumes the safety space behind my vehicle as the other drivers are daydreaming.  I can only report on my personal daily experience on a recently traffic calmed road and the effects it's had driving there.  There's other issues with it (parking needs to be abolish on a much larger stretch of the street as it causes unsafe chicane behaviour with the additional vehicles blocking).  Overall, I've seen little change except for a certain set of drivers choosing to drive well below the limit and the ensuing dangerous conditions caused by the vast difference in speed."

Your character choices seem much more interesting, there's not too much that is simply increased numbers. That's all I can think of off the top of my head."

When residents notice that the road has become icy you always see them out throwing sand on the road. If this happens all the time it's a reasonable fix.

waterloo,2u4ic0,shepd,4,Thu Jan 29 22:04:01 2015 UTC,"A few years ago I had a driver watch me drop my cell phone getting into his cab and wait until I'd gotten home (20$ later) to tell me about it, expecting me to pay fare to go back and get it and then come back home again (so, triple the fare for one trip).  I wouldn't be so mad at him if he hadn't admitted to watching me drop it. Reported him and haven't used that company (I won't say which one) since as when I reported him they basically said I could go rub coarse salt.  We only had enough money to cab back to downtown Kitchener, so my husband cabbed it with the intent of WALKING home. The plows had been through and it was snowing pretty badly, we didn't think he'd find it but he was going to try anyway. The driver heard his story and was miffed for the driver giving them all a bad name.  My husband got out of that second cab, into the snowbank, and actually tripped over my phone. The cab driver, who was about to drive off, looked at him and said ""You found it? Already?"" Turned off his meter and offered him a ride home free of charge. I've only taken that company's cabs since then.  It's a good example of both types of drivers we have in our cities. Some are absolute scumlords, and some are the kind of person I'd love to take out for coffee and just swap stories. I'm excited for Uber, because it will finally encourage the less personable drivers to give good service. Also offer me an alternative to cabbing when my favorite company is very busy."

waterloo,2u38lh,CambridgeReporter,5,Thu Jan 29 15:50:21 2015 UTC,Lowering speed limits on roads that are designed for significantly higher speeds isn't going to be much help. Westmount north of University is probably the most glaring example of this. I would like to see the region introduce more traffic calming measures coupled with separated bike lanes instead.
waterloo,2u38lh,jamincan,5,Thu Jan 29 19:17:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly, if you have a 4 lane road + bike lane, sidewalks and boulevards, with minimal driveways onto the road, your perception of speed is much less.  So you naturally will drive faster.     Lowering the speed limit with rampant enforcement, will have people constantly looking down at the speedometer to make sure they're not over and take their focus off the road."

Germany has the world's best road system and driver training. It's complete nonsense to compare our situation to theirs. Especially since they actually have a relatively light level of enforcement compared to North America, where police departments only care about ticketing for revenue instead of improving traffic safety."
waterloo,2u38lh,powersurge27,12,Sun Feb 1 04:54:39 2015 UTC,"Terrible idea.  This has been tried in the UK. There is evidence that reducing the speed limit from 30mph to 20mph does not actually make roads safer, and actually increases the frequency of minor incidents.   Drivers get annoyed at having to slow to a crawl. Some might obey the 40 limit. Some say ""fuck it"" and speed through at 60. Some might panic at having to slow down and miss potential hazards. Some might slow down suddenly and cause a hazard for the person behind them. And pedestrians don't know what speed anyone is doing because it's totally hit or miss as to whether any motorists are obeying the limit.  Speed does not kill. Changes in speed kill. We need more constant speed limits, not speed traps, and better facilities for bikes and pedestrians.  Also, on a personal note, the limits here are slow enough as it is - I can think of multiple examples in the KW area where a 50kmh limit is posted on what would be a 50mph road in the UK. It's bloody ridiculous."
waterloo,2u38lh,thelatestmodel,5,Thu Jan 29 19:07:35 2015 UTC,"people will speed, people will learn the cop traps. if you want to make the streets safer, put in seperate bike lanes divided by a median or the orange poles. stress the importance to pedestrians to obey their signs. cant tell you how many people just J walk right in front of my car, or kids start walking across when i have an advance left green. fact, it makes me want to run them over more when they fuck with my advanced green"

waterloo,2u38lh,s6xspeed,3,Thu Jan 29 17:19:27 2015 UTC,"To curb any knee-jerk reactions, lowering speed limits in places where ""everyone speeds"" does seem to have an effect (e.g., London, UK).   Side benefits are that stoplight cycles can be sped up somewhat, since people approaching yellow lights don't have to brake as hard, meaning that you are stuck at reds a slightly shorter amount of time. Also, a consistent, in-town speed limit would get rid of those pesky police speed traps at places where the speed limit suddenly changes for no obvious reason."
waterloo,2u38lh,NeuroG,2,Thu Jan 29 15:56:38 2015 UTC,"The amber potion of a traffic signal generally represents 6 second of a 90-120 second cycle.   I highly doubt municipalities, would lower the amount of 3 seconds amber/per direction to anything less."
waterloo,2u38lh,ThunderSteaks,1 point,Thu Jan 29 19:47:08 2015 UTC,"I think it will be great to increase the profits of the ministry.  As for changing someone's driving habits, let me ask you:  If you're driving a Smart car (Top speed 140), and they raised the speed limit on the 401 to 150 km/h, would you rush out and buy a new car because you always do the speed limit?  No?  Do you simply drive at a safe speed instead?  You're probably ignoring speed limits then.  Why would changing the numbers on that sign (or adding one, or just changing the rules) make a difference to you, other than extreme enforcement draining your pocketbook too hard?  If this is to be successful, we will need a lot more police handing out a lot more driving tickets.  Our police budget is already stretched, so that's going to necessitate long response times for what most consider ""real"" crimes.  A very poor tradeoff if we're doing well already.  And we are:  http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/safety/orsar/orsar11/ontario-road-safety-annual-report-2011.pdf  Page 19 shows a 30% decline in fatalities and a 42% decline in serious injuries since 1992.  During this period the speed limit was not changed.  How many of those are from high speed drivers?  Page 33, table 2.8 shows us 0.6% of these accidents occur with ""Speed Too Fast"".

waterloo,2u38lh,buda8220,1 point,Fri Jan 30 05:25:20 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, lowering the speed limit does nothing to improve safety. Accidents don't correlate to high speed, but rather high differences in speed between cars.  In many cases, raising the speed limit will decrease the speed differences, and lower the rate of accidents."
waterloo,2u38lh,difisi,1 point,Fri Jan 30 06:36:51 2015 UTC,"Higher speeds necessarily mean greater differences in speed.   In terms of the maximum difference, sure. However, I see many more people speeding, than going unusually slow. It's likely that increasing the speed limit would bring the average speed difference down.  EDIT: Based on your other comment, I now see that you're referring to cyclists. I'll reply to that one directly."
waterloo,2u38lh,difisi,1 point,Fri Jan 30 16:55:45 2015 UTC,"The majority of those users should not be on the roads.  I'm not certain about rickshaw laws, but pedestrians, rollerbladers, joggers, crazy people, road hockey (illegal to do on the road), protesters, pan handlers, pets and building supplies aren't supposed to be spending anything but a minimal time on the street.  Hot dog carts are also verboten.  Mounted police are trained (I hope!) and so are street car operators (they can and do haul ass anyways).  Cyclists must learn the rules of the road and adhere to them.  At that point if motorists do so (they're supposed to) the laws are designed to prevent all collisions at any speed.  Mennonites seem to prefer to drive their carts in the gravel.  Probably better for their horses that way.  And these rules wouldn't apply to anywhere I've seen them ride except perhaps St. Jacobs (maybe)."
waterloo,2u38lh,shepd,1 point,Fri Jan 30 19:19:44 2015 UTC,"Your idea that the ""rules of the road"" are written to protect cyclists is dangerous and irresponsible to spread.    They are not written only to protect cyclists, they're written to protect those in vehicles from having accidents.  They're also written to help determine fault (although those are a separate set of rules).  Look, you're welcome to ignore as many rules of the road as you like, and if doing so is, in fact, contributing to your safety, that's great.  I have no interest in you having trouble for it.  However, understand that I have a dashcam for a reason.  It seems every year more people get on the road (in cars, bikes, or just as pedestrians) without the slightest clue as to what is legal.  Should a collision occur, you can be certain I'll be submitting my dashcam evidence.  If it turns out you're wrong--that failing to follow the rules of the road actually DOES lead to a collision, you'll end up paying to fix my car.  If you're right, nothing to worry about.  If you've seen any of my other posts, I'm really not the kind of guy that likes laws.  I think most of them are absolute crap.  However, many (certainly not all) of the laws for driving actually have some very solid reasoning behind them and, if followed to the letter, would prevent all collisions entirely.  Considering that driving or cycling are complex enough items, and that the damages are typically very high when a collision occurs, it's very important to actually be able to determine fault.  It's equally important to know how not to be at fault.  I'd never suggest anyone be dead right, but attempting to get motorists frustrated while driving (even if unintentional) is one of those things that will lead to more collisions.  And even 1 km/h is enough to kill someone when done properly, much like people can (and have!) drowned in 1 inch of water.  It's just not a good bet to take.  Your above idea of changing things up to mixed use streets is actually not a bad one.  Motorists are not frustrated when slow driving is a necessity, rather than arbitrary, and thus they pay close attention.  That's why speed bumps and chicanes don't do much, but twisty / poorly marked roads do.  The trouble is, it's expensive to convert all residential streets that way.  I also expect that it would make plowing a bit more expensive, plus in some communities (ours!) it can take a week or two for side streets to be plowed, leaving pedestrians to slog through foot deep snow."

Not 5 minutes later I did another speed test to send the results to my husband, and I was at half speed.

waterloo,2tfu17,isarl,5,Fri Jan 23 21:24:17 2015 UTC,"5 years without one.  Only issue ever has been a pinhole leak near the water heater.  This is almost certainly due to a defect in the pipe and not corrosion as the removed section of pipe appeared perfect apart from the pinhole, and was still as strong as ever.  I also have some easily visible clear PEX, which has not buildup.  Most apartments have been using hard water here, since, well, forever.  If the plumbing was constantly exploding, the landlords would find it more economical to install water softeners.  If you have an electric water heater, you may want soft water as the elements may experience buildup that cannot easily be removed.  However, with a gas water heater, this is not an issue.  Instead, remember to drain the sediment from the tank occasionally (if you can be bothered, I have not done this).  You should change the anode rod occasionally.  I did mine for the first time in 4 years last year.  It still seemed nearly brand new.  So as for wrecking your plumbing, that's an old wives tale.  However, you may not like how hard water feels for showering, shampooing your hair, or washing your hands.  I personally prefer it but many disagree.  Your dishwasher's performance will be lower, as will the performance of your washing machine.  The dishwasher performance is lower since phosphates are required for water as hard as ours, and they have been removed from non-commercial detergent in Canada (most commercial detergent no longer contains them).  They can be added back in, of course, but that is controversial.  You'll have a harder time cleaning your tub, taps, showerhead, sinks, and dishwasher due to scale buildup.  How much of a problem that presents to you is up to you.  So, is a water softener necessary?  No.  Is it recommended?  Possibly.  It's up to you if you want those benefits and don't mind lugging salt around to get them.  As for proof the pinhole leaks being caused by hard water are an old wives tale?  I have never been in a house yet that didn't have a pipe running to their sink carrying hard water.  Yet for some reason that pipe requires no additional maintenance apart from the rest of them in the house.  Also the pipe servicing your house is likely going to be copper.  Again, no extra service required on that.  But they both have hard water, one of them having more water running through it than any other pipe in the house."

I add 2 tsp of vinegar to my dishwasher loads and find it leaves my dishes bright and sparkling, so it hasn't been an issue yet.  I've lived in Ktown for 19 years and have only lived with a water softener for 3 months of those years. I find water softeners make the water too drying - my skin gets itchy - it's very harsh.

I took him for a few walks around the yard there and sat in a room to see how we was at playing, affection etc.  Then when I decided that he would be a great addition to our family, I filled out the forms etc  They called me in less than 24 hrs to tell me I was approved and could get him.   had him going on 3 yrs and he is a really great dog.!"

So  -  no income is not an issue, and in fact I think a part time job is better -  I do remember now they asked me how many hours out of the day I was away from the house,  ( they don;t want the poor thing languishing away by itself for 12 hours a day I'm sure) Good luck !!

I think it is around the 2:10 mark that someone goes to answer him and he says no, he doesn't want the answer today.  The way they phrased the reason for voting on questions to send back was around if it was something everyone was interested in seeing the answer or to just cut out any needless busy work.  Ie if everyone has 10 questions and 5 of them involves a lot of work to get an answer that is a lot of work that needs to be done at the same time as their accounting year end.  As for the firing part, I talked to him a bit at an event and I asked why he wanted to come back instead of retiring and he said he was asked to resign.

waterloo,2t2i6i,shepd,2,Tue Jan 20 19:55:00 2015 UTC,Canada allows common-law partners to obtain a visa if they prove they have lived together for at least a year.  Possibly other countries (all depending on where you may go) might have the same?  If you're not common-law already you should likely do that if you're both committed to each other forever (or at least the foreseeable future)
waterloo,2t2i6i,shepd,2,Tue Jan 20 22:41:47 2015 UTC,"Common-law is something we have considered. Interestingly, I don't think California has common-law, but may recognize my partner as my spouse if we are common-law in our place of origin (Ontario). We have lived together previously and do now, but not for one year continuously (due to university, work, grad school).   Since marriage is basically universally recognized and doesn't involve different/complicated paperwork, we just decided to get married. It's simpler."
waterloo,2t2i6i,outtsider,2,Wed Jan 21 14:33:20 2015 UTC,"You'll pay the marriage license fee, but apart from that, your job will be to find whichever of the following is cheapest to officiate the marriage (obviously, if you know one of these personally, you could probably get it done for a case of beer):   Authorized religious official Justice of the Peace Judge Municipal Clerk   The first one is easy to find, although perhaps not cheap (but then again, there are religious officials happy enough to get a donation in exchange for a few minutes of their time).  The last three, I think you'd be best asking at the courthouse who can do the job and what they'll bill you for it.  You can save much of the cost of the marriage license by shopping around.  Every city has the right to charge whatever they can get out of you for it, as long as they bill a minimum of $75 (That article mentions Tweed, Ontario and Brock, Ontario will offer the license for the statutory minimum.  Nearby Ingersoll is $90).  A very small township might do it for much less than here.  There is no need for you to be married in this city--an Ontario marriage license is an Ontario marriage license.  Kitchener is very expensive at $150.  And yes, the officiate city and the license city may be different.  The officiation appears to be valid for 3 months.  So I've already saved you $75 (minus the cost of gas).  Enjoy it!"

I do agree that high schools should not be pushing kids into quick post-secondary decisions. I was told, and I quote, that ""it would be such a terrible waste if you didn't go to university next year"" by my academic adviser 5 years ago. I'm graduating in a month realizing that all I ever really wanted was to work outdoors with my hands, which I easily could have accomplished with a college degree. I'm lucky that I knew what field I wanted to get into, but my friends were pushed very hard into taking a year in university just to ""figure stuff out"" if they didn't know what they wanted to do.   There is a stigma in Ontario's high schools (well, at least in Woodstock) that not going to university is a poor decision. Then again, these guidance counselors often all come from a time where going to university was a privilege and not nearly as much of a necessity as it is today. The times are changing, but the educational system is not changing with it."

waterloo,2sp3gw,ILikeStyx,10,Mon Jan 19 00:55:53 2015 UTC,"While there are bylaws that say the owner of the property in front of the sidewalk must clear it, it is in essence unenforceable on a large scale. It is a bit of a cold war that keeps owners clearing it and keeps the City from handing out tickets.  Little known fact: sidewalks are almost all on City property. The last 8-10 feet of a property, from the road, is City owned. Not a lean. This is how they can widen roads that need it without having to buy property from the home owner, do infrastructure repairs, etc. After that 8-10 feet, there is often a lean of another 6-8 feet that the homeowner owns, but the City has the right to dig up and install/repair infrastructure. There are minor variances, but for the most part, this is how it is across most of the City. The City-owned part is obvious in areas of high foot traffic, such as Uptown. You almost never see a store owner or clerk clearing the sidewalk on King street, it is all City equipment and staff that do it.   So what happens is that the owner of the land in front of the sidewalk is responsible through bylaws for clearing the sidewalk. Most people clear it, those who don't often do once a warning has been issued, and rarely does the City give out tickets. If they were to give out too many tickets, people would get pissed and eventually someone would challenge it in court and get the bylaw struck down. How can the City force people to clear a sidewalk on land they don't technically own? Isn't that some sort of slavery? Can I file for Worker's Compensation if I hurt myself clearing the snow? There are all sorts of sticky legal arguments against the snow clearing bylaws.  In Elmira, the City clears all sidewalks, and does an amazing job of it I might add. It is even a line-item on your property taxes (about $70/year for the average home owner). I would personally be in favour of Waterloo going this route."

I have a sidewalk in front of my home that I shovel diligently. But it is a pain, I can't wait until after the snowfall to clear it, I have to do it multiple times during the snow fall due to the foot traffic packing down the snow as it comes down. The sidewalk is clearly not on my property as per the site survey I got when I purchased my home.

The drinks at Jane Bond were excellent, but I would never go there for actual food. Just feels like the food is sort of thrown together with no actual attempt to try and taste good."

Steckle Farm is really great if you are into the barn look. I am kind of biased to this one because it was my wedding, but everything about the venue was perfect for what I wanted. I loved it.  Not technically Cambridge area but I was in a wedding at Cutten Fields in Guelph this past summer as well, and their hall is SO pretty. Also the people were fabulous.

I think it was ~25-30$ per plate, which included salad and dessert (but not drinks.)  I will also always always recommend a live band, especially if you want to have awesome dancing.

Pavillion was really nice during the summer and guests can kinda go freely around the park, good picture spots, outdoor ceremony.  The Museum was just really classy, we didnt have set dinner there just some food stations, but it was really nice and definitely one of the nicer venues ive been too...   I would try to avoid places like hotels and that hall in St Jacobs(ish) area (St James hall I think?).  I find them just really plain, overdone, and kind of like a ""box"" wedding.   edit: Actually want to add too about Concordia club, that place was also very nice but I hear it comes with quite the price tag."

waterloo,2rvrka,MrsPoopington,3,Fri Jan 9 21:28:16 2015 UTC,"There are many rules about who can or can't give blood, so having appointments probably makes it easier than telling people everything in person, as they can just go to the website and read it."

waterloo,2rhi2t,Have_No_Name,3,Tue Jan 6 17:49:01 2015 UTC,I do know that last year Waterloo went WAY over its snow maintenance budget because of all of the snow.  Maybe they've cut back this year?
waterloo,2rhi2t,mdelow,7,Tue Jan 6 18:34:48 2015 UTC,"Like everywhere in Ontario, roads are plowed in accordance with maintenance standards set out in the Municipal Act. Main roads are cleared first, and will continue to be cleared during snow/ice events. Local roads (ie, your street) are always last. The schedules for those are randomized as per the city website: http://www.waterloo.ca/en/living/schedules.asp"
waterloo,2rhi2t,waterluvian,1 point,Tue Jan 6 16:14:38 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who is a municipal road patroller.   The municipalities are legally required to ensure roads meet standards set by the Government of Ontario.   Roads have different classifications and how they are maintained depends on that classification.   The information is plotted on a tablet.    Work orders are generated for the appropriate departments.    Regional road issues are forwarded to the region for action.   Some issues such as a downed stop sign have to be called into dispatch.   Someone puts out a temporary sign and a work order is generated for a permanent fix.     Potholes have to fit into certain size and depth, raised manhole covers have to be a certain depth.   Yep he has to do measurements.  Signs are only allowed to lean a certain amount.      Certain asphalt temperatures have to be recorded.   I believe that is on bridges.   I joke with him that all he does is drive around all day.   In fact he has to follow a set of standards set out by Queen's Park.   Governments love to make things complicated.    The city is divided up into salting and plowing zones.   In the winter he is required to do a winter patrol and reports back to the central dispatch anything that does not meet the standards."
waterloo,2rhi2t,rickhd,2,Thu Jan 8 19:40:54 2015 UTC,Also worth noting is that the budgets are Jan 1 - Jan 1. So last year's (2014) snow-clearing budget was surpassed in Jan-Mar 2014 .. so Nov and Dec 2014 they were spending money they didn't have.  Now that it's 2015 it (should) be better?
waterloo,2rhi2t,cht13er,2,Tue Jan 6 15:09:43 2015 UTC,Now that it's 2015 it (should) be better?   Budgets are not like starting over in a game. They have probably depleted a reserve fund and are probably going to be more cautious about resource allocation going forward.
waterloo,2rhi2t,mpd618,1 point,Wed Jan 7 04:56:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt but were five days into January so far and I haven't seen any changes."
waterloo,2rhi2t,rickhd,2,Tue Jan 6 15:31:46 2015 UTC,I am showing my age.  Years ago when winters where more severe you never had a bare road.   Of course traffic was light compared to today.  Studded tires and tire chains where allowed.  Outside the city most roads where gravel.
waterloo,2rhi2t,superbad,1 point,Wed Jan 7 00:52:11 2015 UTC,"I haven't noticed a lack of plowing in Waterloo.  The sidewalks are crap, but the roads have been getting lots of attention."
waterloo,2rhi2t,waterluvian,5,Tue Jan 6 16:17:09 2015 UTC,"That's the more pressing issue. In Waterloo, these are a mix of private/public responsibility. The city does most of the Uptown area and sidewalks without homes/businesses directly in front, but most others are owners' responsibility. Chances are if you're walking on a crappily cleared sidewalk, technically it's the homeowner's fault. There's a map here: http://www.waterloo.ca/en/contentresources/resources/living/sidewalk_maintenance_map_2015.pdf"
waterloo,2rhi2t,Woofcat,2,Tue Jan 6 16:21:09 2015 UTC,Technically it's not the homeowners responsibility. The city must clear the sidewalk if the owner doesn't. If someone slips and falls on the sidewalk it is the liability of the city.   They simply make it a bylaw that you have to clear your sidewalk and fine if you don't.
waterloo,2rhi2t,rickhd,1 point,Tue Jan 6 16:48:03 2015 UTC,Correct.  In Ontario the city is responsible regardless of any other by-laws in place.   There is no clear expectation that homeowners will clear sidewalks.   If you fall you can sue the city.   I had a serious fall and successfully sued.   If you fall and injure yourself on a city sidewalk see a lawyer within 10 days.
waterloo,2rhi2t,waterluvian,2,Thu Jan 8 14:34:55 2015 UTC,"I had no idea! Just looking up my address, it seems like the owner of my property should be having the walkways cleared and they are definitely not being shovelled right now. I thought it was super funny that the person across the street was clearing their sidewalk and that they had gotten fed up with the city not doing it. Back home we have bobcats that come through and plow all the sidewalks."
waterloo,2rhi2t,shepd,2,Thu Jan 8 19:19:22 2015 UTC,You can report the owner of your property for not clearing their sidewalk. It has to be more than 24 hours after the last snowfall. Details here: http://www.waterloo.ca/en/living/sidewalkclearing.asp
waterloo,2rhi2t,shepd,1 point,Tue Jan 6 19:41:48 2015 UTC,"More plowing leads to more salting, and massive amounts of salt suck for the environment and your car.  Get a set of snow tires and it's not a problem.  For what it's worth, the cheap walmart snow tires tires are on at half-price clearance right now (Sunrise centre, at least) and while not aggressive enough for particularly heavy snow, they're great for this area.  And yes, it has been worse.  The last couple of years I've actually noticed the residential side streets being plowed semi-regularly.  For several years previously I found myself having to drive 5 foot forward, 4 foot reverse and so on as the snow was higher than my bumpers."
waterloo,2rhi2t,mr-agdgdgwngo,2,Wed Jan 7 14:23:44 2015 UTC,"What your describing is a situation you are used to. I have a set of winter tires and I can drive in the snow. All I am saying is that the plowing is drastically worse then what I have experienced in the maritimes.    And yes, it has been worse. The last couple of years I've actually noticed the residential side streets being plowed semi-regularly   I have lived in both big cities and small towns in the maritimes in two different provinces and it was not unusual to see side-streets being cleaned once an hour during snow. I rarely have seen a plow on the roads here and my side street in Uptown hasn't been cleaned at all in the last week and there is a solid layer of compacted snow."
waterloo,2rhi2t,Clothing_Mandatory,2,Tue Jan 6 16:09:14 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there is better plowing in other cities.  However, to a certain degree, Waterloo Region is stretching the budget pretty thin for various reasons.  That leads to the tradeoff of either higher taxes (which isn't a possibility when you're already one of the most highly taxes communities in the province) or just doing less.  Yes, I know, it sucks.  There may be one other reason:  The winter swings pretty wildly here.  I don't know what it is like in the maritimes, but here you've experienced the usual 20 degree swings in low temperatures.  That makes it really tough to figure out what to do on the streets because what you use to clear ice/compacted snow at -5 C doesn't work at -20.  Combine that with just how random winter is here and it sucks for snow clearing.  It would actually be easier to deal with if the temperature just sat at -20 for the next 2 months.  I dunno, just my excuses for it.  Yes, you're right, I'm just used to it.  But then again, I advocate giving up on all but minimal snow clearance and instead making it legal for drivers to have (rubber) studded tires.  I'd rather my car stop rotting to pieces every winter, never mind not dumping tonnes of crap on the roads (and thus into the sewers).  :)"

waterloo,2rg309,shepd,2,Wed Jan 7 14:13:32 2015 UTC,"I experienced it at PAX East (If you're into gaming it's definitely worth going to and oculus will be there, but at this point you'll have to pay scalper's premiums for passes plus convenient hotels are tough to come by).  I also experienced the older DK1.  DK2 still had screen door effect for me, and the resolution was not enough to make me interested in buying it.  DK1 actually seemed to have less screen door effect (many have told me that's because the oculus folks didn't adjust my DK2 demo unit properly) and better resolution.  However, most importantly, DK1 were very much puke goggles even after a minute or two, and DK2 were pleasant enough I am sure I could wear them for hours on end if I wanted to.  I should say I have experience with HMDs and am VERY tolerant to the nausea inducing effects some of them can produce.  To the point people had no clue how I  can put up with it.  But the DK1s didn't stay on my head for very long.  Just way too barfy.  Both kits were way too bulky for me to take them seriously, however.  Of course, I'm expecting something more like my Olympus FMD-150W, which will probably never happen so long as Oculus rabidly avoids custom tiny screens.  The price is good enough that if you REALLY want it NOW, I suppose you could burn the money in worse ways.  However, frankly, I would just wait for one more iteration.  Enhanced resolution and a more comfortable size would make a significant difference to the product.  Also, who knows if the final product will work with old software.  And no, just because lots of people have them doesn't mean people will keep making things compatible.  It's been over a decade since anything was released for my Wicked 3D eyescream card (can you tell I love the idea of 3D and silly head mounted glasses?)  Heck 3D compatible HDMI monitors and projectors are common enough people don't realize they have them and Nvidia still has to hack many modern games to make them work properly..."

waterloo,2qxupa,macpwns,3,Wed Dec 31 18:48:30 2014 UTC,"I don't know about ice time, but I use the indoor field (in winter) and while the rates are indeed very high, it's booked out completely as evidenced by the fact that I'm in there twice a week in a block that extends to midnight. So this suggests that, at least for the field hall, reducing the price would (sadly) not bring in more money."
waterloo,2qxupa,epostma,1 point,Wed Dec 31 20:41:49 2014 UTC,"Its funny, the city of Kitchener has this process for rinks - which I would almost assume is the same for indoor fields - where they try and get people to sign contracts for fixed times throughout the year/season; i.e 12 x 1 hr time slots for a cost of ~$250/session. I play hockey every Monday at 10PM at one of the rinks and it actually works out to be $100 cheaper PER TIME SLOT if we call every single Wednesday to book the time for the following Monday, have the agreement faxed to us, complete the form, return by fax with a credit card number and then wait for confirmation. We've had the same time all year and saved SO much $. Sometimes I simply do not understand the logic behind these models. Senseless."
waterloo,2qxupa,macpwns,1 point,Fri Jan 2 16:13:48 2015 UTC,My guess is they figure if you are booking many nights you are a company who will just pay the $100 more per night.

As for a optometrist, book a appointment at the University of Waterloo vision center. You not only help train students, but they gave me the most thorough eye exam I ever had in my life, and I've been wearing glasses for about 30 years. Well worth the cost.   Eye exam was about 90, which is about average. Glasses cost me 300 for 2 pairs, one regular and one sunglasses, however I have a high astigmatism so my lenses cost a lot more than average due to me getting the high index lenses instead of cokebottle glasses."

They aren't exactly playgrounds, but it is at least an activity outside of the house and most places only charge to use the toy library - the rest is free.

waterloo,2popn5,Anomander,1 point,Thu Dec 18 17:58:20 2014 UTC,"It would be socially unjust to rehire an employee who, under the circumstances presented (giving away product of any sort without permission, being very formally told never to do that again, and then repeating the wrong action).  Who she gives it to is completely irrelevant, although from the article we see its a boyfriend and U of W employees.  A friend of someone who (was) employed, and those who are employed.  That's not going to gain sympathy from anyone.  If it were the homeless, it's still wrong, but at least it's not completely embarrassing like this incident.  As to the idea that this runs counter to UW's goal of being an employer of choice, please...  Who wants to work with someone who bends the rules after being disciplined, especially on something that's obviously not right to do.  It's like working with a time bomb, you never know when you're going to have to fill their shoes."
waterloo,2popn5,shepd,9,Wed Dec 24 00:52:02 2014 UTC,I believe if she had been provided fair warning and was asked to correct her behaviour but failed to do so then it is justified and the right thing for the employer to do.
waterloo,2popn5,ILikeStyx,14,Thu Dec 18 16:19:52 2014 UTC,"Well, she did steal from her employer.  It's not like she even did it to help out a couple of homeless people; she was just giving out freebies to her boyfriend and her friends."
waterloo,2popn5,HellaBex,9,Thu Dec 18 15:44:15 2014 UTC,"Sure, and from a nihilist point of view a few sandwiches don't matter because nothing actually matters.   ...but then again nobody gets to choose the moral framework others use to assess their actions. It doesn't actually matter if there's a philosophy or two where her actions can be either excused or praised, because she was given a simple instruction from someone with the power to give it ... and didn't follow it."
waterloo,2popn5,Anomander,1 point,Thu Dec 18 19:36:03 2014 UTC,"Granted. She was given instructions and didn't follow them so she got fired. No argument there. However, I'm not interested in that, my question did not relate to that.   And my reply did contain more than ""but the rules"" ...  It was more pointing out that how a given action might be regarded within a specific moral framework doesn't particularly matter if that analysis requires ignoring the entirety of the real-world context.    The fundamental principle that context can change the moral value of a given action is core to philosophy of morals, given that finding a theory that can account for edge cases is far harder than finding a theory that sounds good on clear cases but provides no framework or guidance on the tough questions.  Simply ignoring or omitting context in a moral discussion is like spherical sharks in a vacuum to physics - great on paper, but largely meaningless beyond the basics."
waterloo,2popn5,Anomander,3,Thu Dec 18 22:23:26 2014 UTC,"Is it worth a criminal charge?? Especially after a warning?!? If this was my place of business and I caught you stealing, you'd be lucky to get that verbal warning! doesn't matter if its a 3$ sandwich or a 300$ case of beef. If she gives out a free sandwich everyday what's that going to cost at the end of the month? If you're a business that tracks waste and everythig else, thats going to totally throw your numbers off by the end of the week/month. Besides it comes down to principle and being able to follow basic instructions. If your going to steal and act like an uneducated fool and not follow proper procedure why would I want you working for me?"
waterloo,2popn5,DJ_Lud,2,Fri Dec 19 18:22:12 2014 UTC,"Well as I do see what you are saying. You asked if it is not a greater crime to throw away ""expired food"" yet still nutritious. It comes down to company policy, not your personal opinions or morals. The law is the law and if you're going to break it or lie about it, is not smart. This job pays your bills and your food for you and your children and your going to jeopardize that over a free sandwich for your boyfriend?! Somebody needs to get their priorities straight and out of the gutter. As i see what you are saying in general ""its still good dont throw it out"" i believe in that but i also beleive its even more smart to listen to what your employer wants from you. Considering you didn't pay for it, it's not yours or your choice what to do with that product or your business in general. Can't be giving away things that are not yours to give. It's common sense."
waterloo,2popn5,DJ_Lud,1 point,Fri Dec 19 19:15:51 2014 UTC,"Some companies still need to tally that loss! Im a chef! And I have been in a lot restaurants that tally food waste and cost it out to try and eliminate it as much as possible! Everything thrown away was paid for and if wanting to rectify this waste it cannot be done by giving it away. This can turn into a big thing by the end of the month if to you cant track it to cover the costs or buy less so it doesnt ""go bad"" instead she gives it to people therefore losing me money!! I could have the chance to fix this loss in  bread and eggsalad (for example) if i knew it was going to waste instead of givin away. It comes down to she is throwing away MY money and its absolutely unacceptable!! You can't say you would allow somebody that works at your business to give away free services when specificly warned not to!! If this is to happen what? You're going to allow this person to give away money? I think not I think you would fire their ass no quesions asked!! Thats YOUR money!"
waterloo,2popn5,DJ_Lud,1 point,Thu Dec 18 21:37:23 2014 UTC,"Certainly, but from an employment point of view, as a single mother (as the article made sure to point out) who had previously been warned to knock it off, one would think she'd at least practice a little more discretion.  I just think that if she had been doing this to help people who are actually in need, this little ""social justice group"" might have a stronger case."
waterloo,2popn5,HellaBex,10,Thu Dec 18 21:39:26 2014 UTC,"Even if this person was not givin a verbal warning I would still consider it theft. Givig free food even if it is ""expired"" can lead to many issues. Somebody could get very sick and have terms to sue. Let alone giving food to her boyfriend! In my honest opinion she was lucky to ger her second chance. Either she a single mom or not. Theft is theft and followig proper  ompany policy is important!"

waterloo,2popn5,DKsan,1 point,Fri Dec 19 05:45:12 2014 UTC,"No, they're not being pissy. While there are problems with giving away even food left at the end of the day that would otherwise be thrown out (e.g. liability issues mention in other comments), WPIRG is not asking for the worker to be reinstated without consequences. They are saying the action was too harsh and should have just been a demerit in her file and not immediate firing.  I'm assuming that WPIRG did their due diligence and determining that this was a first offence rather than the final straw in a string of warnings for the worker and as such it would have to agree that the termination was excessive."
waterloo,2popn5,CoryCA,1 point,Thu Dec 18 21:22:37 2014 UTC,"After reading some of the comments here on reddit, it seems that my assumption of WPIRG doing due diligence was incorrect.  The worker worker had apparently been talked to previously about giving away food on the date of expiry but had not reformed her actions. A person like that is not a reliable employee, especially since she was giving the freebies too her boyfriend and not homeless people and thus doesn't even have the moral high ground.  It makes me wonder - was she the one making the sandwiches, or just the cashier? If she was making them, that begs the question if she was deliberately making too many such that there would be some to expire? Because they would be deliberate, blatant theft compared to a simple giving out of ""honestly"" expired goods."

waterloo,2pl9pq,CambridgeReporter,2,Wed Dec 17 16:59:08 2014 UTC,"It's counter-intuitive, but I firmly believe the war on drugs brings these numbers up.  Pharmacists are professionals at keeping people safe on medication (doctors too, of course).  If that's where today's street drugs were purchased, I believe pharmacists would encourage abusers to seek help and at a minimum advise them when they plan to do something that risks death.  Of course, there are those that believe many others would take hard drugs if they were easily available.  While I don't question that the number of people trying certain things to see what the buzz is about, countries that have tried a more liberal approach have found that overall the harm level decreases significantly and those who aren't taking hard drugs today continue to not take them tomorrow.  For a reasonable comparison, ask a non-smoker if today's easy availability of cigarettes encourages them to smoke.  I am willing to bet the answer is ""Not really""."

The route that is currently being built? Not talking about that...  The parts going to Cambridge and Elmira, which are not part of stage 1, are not what is currently being built, and are what you claimed you ""imagined"", those two parts (of the three - again, not talking about stage 1, the part in the middle currently being built), those are the parts you plagiarized. You didn't come up with those - they were proposed a few years ago.

The soil in your garden or on your lawn definitely won't complain when it gets the nutrients that are supposed to be there from falling leaves anyways."
waterloo,2p2yq4,Quock,7,Fri Dec 12 16:00:31 2014 UTC,"I went to the composting workshop at the landfill a few years ago, and I learned that the leaves that are collected by the loose leaf collection program are diverted to farm lands and used to enrich the soil, but anything that is bagged has to, by (provincial?) law, be treated as waste and can't be composted.  Hopefully that changes if it hasn't already changed.  I agree, though, that the best thing to do is to mulch it yourself."

This location (and it's where I would have suggested anyone go, they have good selection, great prices, and incredible service--no I do not work there) is very easy to access from Fischer Hallman by car.  From Ottawa, it is only accessible when travelling ""North"" (East by the compass).  Exiting is a little bit more difficult.  You cannot travel West (""South"") on Ottawa, and travelling North on Fischer Hallman will take a bit of patience.  On my personal scale of difficulty for K/W driving, where 1 is pulling out of a driveway on a residential sidestreet and 10 is parallel parking downtown (ok, ok, 'uptown') on King during rush hour, I'd give it a 4.

waterloo,2okq7h,sutherbland,1 point,Mon Dec 8 02:35:58 2014 UTC,"I don't think it would alienate them. Most people get to websites via the search engine their browser defaults too, rather than typing in blackberry.com or Waterloo.ca. The confusion you mention, I only see that when an email address doesn't end in one of those well known gTLDs, not URLs, because most people don't know the part after the @ is related to the part after the http://  For that reason I don't think it would be disadvantgeous. Most people won't realize that Google sent them too http://theplumbingstore.waterloo/ instead of http://theplumbingstoreofwaterlooregion.com/ and for that minority savvy enough know, it's a heck of a lot less cumbersome.  I note that these same arguments were also raised 15 years ago when .ca started to become popular. But even back then, about half of all website visits were referrals from search engines.

waterloo,2okq7h,spyd4r,1 point,Mon Dec 8 15:38:16 2014 UTC,"You don't need a sponsoring organization. The organization that wants to run the new gTLD files the application, meets the requirements and pays the registration fees to ICANN.

I think you misunderstand. It wouldn't be ""the region"" doing this, it would be a company offering this gTLD to anybody who would like to make a domain in it. No person or organization in Waterloo Region would have to switch to using *.waterloo any more than Canadian companies had to switch from .com to .ca when that became available. If the region wanted region.waterloo, the city wanted city.waterloo, UW wanted university.waterloo, WRDSB wanted schoolboard.waterloo, or the GRT+ION wanted transit.waterloo that would be awesome, but this wouldn't be some official mandate that they have to do so."

(maybe the company that lets them use it would give them a cut of the profit for the referral?) like it's a web address personalized specifically for the waterloo region, so not adopting it across the board kind of seems like a wasted opportunity and a waste of money because no one else would have use for it.  sorry for being all over the place, i guess i'm not fully understanding what a gTLD is/does and the implications behind it."

They're the same people who don't signal a lane change or check their blind spots, tailgate, and drive too fast in bad weather. Good driving isn't about getting to your destination as quickly as possible, it's about making sure that you and the people you're sharing the road with are safe.

The crosswalks are way too close to the roundabout itself. As a motorist it is very difficult to see people trying to cross (especially when there is a lineup of cars), and pedestrians have to guess where cars are going to enter and exit the roundabout.   All the crosswalks should be moved at least 10m further away from the roundabouts, this would greatly help solve this issue."

waterloo,2oebv7,Foodwraith,7,Sun Dec 21 12:20:25 2014 UTC,"As someone with British parents I have been well trained in roundabout usage, especially signalling. Signalling is one of the major factors leading to vehicle on pedestrian, and vehicle on vehicle, mayhem in round abouts. Too few have been properly trained on how to use their signal within a round about. If you are making a right turn, signal right. If you are entering the roundabout to go across or go to the left most exit, signal left, then when you are ready to exit, signal right. If I, as a pedestrian, can see your right blinker then I won't walk into the crosswalk and directly into your path."

I'm Certainly not trying to say drivers have the right of way. - - Pedestrians ALWAYS have the right of way.

waterloo,2oebv7,Quock,4,Sat Dec 6 11:46:47 2014 UTC,Yes. I always make sure it is 100% safe before crossing any road.. especially at the roundabouts. When I would walk to the Canadian Tire plaza I would not start crossing until the cars came to a full stop.

waterloo,2oebv7,keyser-_-soze,3,Sat Dec 6 22:44:48 2014 UTC,"I sometimes feel that it is due to poor training. Drivers think that it is a race who enters the round-about first. For that reason they do not even slow down near the entrance. It is too late if a pedestrian comes in way. Drivers must not be over 20 when near the round-about, i mean even before the crosswalk and island. This needs to be even slower in case of poor conditions like snow/ice."

Someday it will save you a lot more than that if you drive near the university or through these roundabouts.  Of course, I also practice extreme caution at the idiotically designed intersections here, but at some point, there's just nothing that can be done when pedestrians (and some cyclists) have a death wish."

Plus a bunch that just give the driver the finger for daring to honk at them who never start a conversation afterwards. Oh, and the non-student guy with whom I've had that conversation twice.

I'm not certain as to the difference, but my gut feeling is that most cases could have neither party at fault. If single fault were the uncommon case, it would not be represented in a ""driving properly"" statistic. Well, that and UK roads are kind of crazy. :)  Also, UK driving tests focus much more heavily on driving style over rules of the road. Both my British parents had their tests there and fail items included (and still do) zero rollback during hill starts, smooth gear shifting, and a demonstration of holding a vehicle in place with the clutch. None of which helps prevent a pedestrian/cyclist collision. :) in that same style, I believe they'll soon be including GPS usage as part of the test."
waterloo,2oebv7,shepd,0,Fri Dec 5 22:13:33 2014 UTC,"Bike lanes here drive me nuts as a driver because some idiot thought it's a good idea to have a lane meant for straight through traffic to the right of a single-lane right turn lane.  Drivers that don't signal suck ass too.  IMHO, there's an equal number of both shitty drivers and shitty cyclists. However, the things I've seen shitty cyclists do (blow through lights and stops several seconds after the light changes, turn left from the far right lane, ride through crosswalks) are rarely duplicated by bad drivers--and if they were, chaos would ensue.  There's lots of overlap, though. Signaling and overrunning the yellow would be tops.  The cyclists just stand out more because motorists don't want to kill someone and being a bad cyclist inevitably leads to death, whereas a bad driver typically ends up broke.  I, myself, only get arrogant around the university, since the stupid things I've seen there are so novel it boggles my mind. :) Elsewhere cyclists tend to be pretty good at what they do.  There's a new WTF coming from the city, too. Bridge and lexington. Some genius made a sideways cycling lane in front of traffic in the intersection there. Without offering brand new education to drivers, I expect some interesting collisions to result."

Most of the recipes have fewer than 15 ingredients total, and they cover your basics: protein, carbs, fats, vitamins, minerals  The fewer the total ingredients, the better $/day (generally)  My goal is to start with a fairly basic recipe just to start out and then find some decent flavors to work in.

There was always a health update or a new fundraiser organized by his family and friends with the help of local organizations. He seemed to be in remission for a while and was given the go ahead to resume playing hockey in the junior league a few weeks ago.  Sadly, I heard today that the cancer has spread and he was given a month or so to live without a stem cell transplant. In order to receive such thing, you need to find someone with close to 100% stem cell match. This is fairly difficult but not impossible. Bigger chances are within someone's ethnicity group (Portuguese in his case). Local newspapers and radio stations are calling people (mainly 17 to 35 year old males) to go to the upcoming blood donor clinics and OneMatch swab events to find a stem cell donor match.  A similar thing was done in Cambridge Ontario last Febreuary and a young girl found her match within the 777 people who showed up and her life was saved.

Curious, what was the problem you had with existing solutions?  I've spent the last six years involved at the ground-level of emerging music and have thought deeply about what challenges artists face. I put on shows to embarrassingly low audiences for artists who now appear on the cover of Fader. I have written-about and am friends with some of the largest Canadian artists right now, though our friendship began before they released any music. While I can attest to the many problems faced by independent musicians, it is my feeling that none of these issues have to do with the ability to reach an audience. Sure, that's the end goal, but if you spend enough time in here you realize that it's all about community; your music scene, your local community, your national community, etc.   About 10% of musicians are randomly lucky, and 90% achieve ""success"" (for some definition of this term) through:   constant touring being active in a local community (putting on shows, writing about artists) via 1 and 2: building a network of contacts and friends across Canada leveraging the positive relationships from 3 to get your music out there. (5. sometimes 4 will land you a deal with a good publicist)   Eventually, through steps 1-4(5), your music gets heard by some taste maker and you're allowed to enter the pantheon of music careerism. I spent 3 years as a Polaris juror watching jurors ignore my recommendations for Grimes and Mac Demarco, but as soon as they were written about in Pitchfork, they became their biggest fans.  In any case, what I wanted to say was that, ironically, there was a time when MySpace was the most powerful tool for emerging artists. Not because it had a player but because it helped artists create a community. Crawling the social network of artists was how we built Weird Canada and how we helped create a community of emerging and experimental music.  So, my advice to young entrepreneurs is this: it's all about tools to help build and empower a community.   PS - it's worth noting that this is not dissimilar from entrepreneurship itself. Do you think this is a meritocracy where the best ideas wins? Hell no. Kitchener-Waterloo is an innovation community, and, in my opinion, this is what allows for startups in this region to achieve success."

They do say that their services offer faster speeds, and this is true but it is biased in one direction which gives you a faster download speed and slower upload, usually a 10:1 ratio. Bell's VDSL and FTTH/FTTN is more balanced for upload/download. I've have Rogers 150/10 and Bell's 50/50 Fibe ""Fiber"" and I'm extremely happy with Fibe. There are no congestion issues and my ""ping""/ Latency is usually 0.01ms-0.017ms which is very very quick.    With Rogers I always had to manually set my DNS to 8.8.8.8 because theirs went down randomly and I had to restart my modem and router often.   Bell has been busy downtown Kitchener/Waterloo running new fiber lines (REAL Fiber lines) new speeds are rolling out all the time. I highly recommend ditching Rogers.   If you NEED Television AND Internet go with Bell. If you need basic Internet only, go with Teksavvy they will throw in basic home phone for another $10 a month. Teksavvy only require you purchase your own equipment up front, no contracts and the service is prepaid so you can cancel when ever, no cancellation fees or anything, as new speeds roll out you have the option to stay with your current speed or you can simply ask to change it.

waterloo,2o49sg,kdmarshall,8,Wed Dec 3 12:35:28 2014 UTC,"She often stands at the corners of King and Willis Way. She acts as if she needs help crossing the road, and as soon as you move to help - the begging begins. Really low way to bait someone into hearing your sob story..."
waterloo,2o49sg,blayrh6,4,Wed Dec 3 16:52:42 2014 UTC,"I have seen her on two occasions.  Once she approached me and my friend asking for money, which my friend gave to her.  Another time I was sitting in Coffee Culture and saw her follow a girl in and ask her to buy her something to eat.  I don't know what her full story is but she's definitely around a lot."
waterloo,2o49sg,deadbolt_cathedral,5,Wed Dec 3 05:36:24 2014 UTC,"I have come across her multiple times uptown and she always has a new story. Tell her to fuck off.   On this topic, I used to work part time at the beer store on weber street. It sounds terrible but don't give the homeless who beg on the streets money. 90% of the time it's coming right back to either the beer store or lcbo.   If you want to help just buy them a snack or something. Just my 2 cents."

waterloo,2o49sg,outtsider,5,Wed Dec 3 21:11:09 2014 UTC,"Yeah, she's approached me several times outside of the Coffee Culture on King Street. And like others are saying, always with a different sob story (I think she's got like eleventeen children and 47 starving puppies now). The first time I actually felt bad for her, since it was cold out and she said she couldn't find work because of her condition or whatever, but she didn't wanna give details when pressed about her story (ie. ""How old are these kids?"", etc). The last time I saw her, the people in front of us gave her a five, and she asked for more. As we passed them, my friend commented that she couldn't be that hard up for cash if she's walking around with a Coach purse...   Holy CRAP is she pushy, though."

If you really don't want to feel bad, carry gift cards on you and see if they take it. If they don't, they're lying to you.  I've heard of another one where an old woman (probably the same one) and another younger lady swap around an arm cast and a wheelchair - somebody drove past them twice, one hour apart, and they had literally swapped wheelchair and cast."
waterloo,2o49sg,DracoYunho,7,Tue Dec 16 04:39:36 2014 UTC,"I gave her a ride from Uptown Waterloo (central library actually) to an apartment building near Westmount and Highland I think. It was dark, I had time and it didn't bother me to do it. I handed her some spare change too.   I am OK with it. I don't care if half of what she tells me is BS. If you have to beg it means to me that you have problems, whether they be mental, physical, social or whatever. Who wants to beg?  Granted she is pushy. I guess that if you have to do this to survive you have to be pushy. I don't think people who do drugs or alcohol (I could smell she drinks) are trying to scam you. I think their issues are much bigger than that, and unfortunately this is a way for them to try and cope. Their lives most likely suck. When I give them some change, I know I'd like them to spend it on socks or a can of beans, but I know that the LCBO is probably higher on their list. I have to accept that too.  If she has a social worker it is a good start already, at least she is getting some help. I hope she manages to make good use of it and eventually put her life back on track."

If Uber came to the region, I'd use their service if needed (like I use taxis when needed currently). I'd rather bus to where ever I'm going."

The criticism in this article makes it sound as if the customer has no control over who picks them up, which isn't true. The video linked shows that you can see the driver's information, including their license plate, rating, and GPS location. That's more control than with a taxi company. Makes me think the people interviewed about this didn't fully understand what Uber offered."
waterloo,2o24dc,Kellexx,1 point,Tue Dec 2 17:35:54 2014 UTC,"Most of the interviewees in articles I have been reading seem to have no idea how the company actually operates. They cite being worried about criminals and bad drivers, when checks on both of those are a requirement for being hired, and the rating system will get a bad driver fired pretty quick."
waterloo,2o24dc,PaeTar,14,Fri Feb 6 14:53:37 2015 UTC,"I'm all for it. The tone of this article seems to mainly be that the people in charge of taxis don't understand how Uber might be better. The government employees and taxi representatives interviewed lean on the idea of ""regulation"" as the only way to ensure a good customer experience even though evidence points to bad service and sketchy drivers. Every argument they present in favour of the current system instead demonstrates how Uber could be a better alternative.  ""Waterloo taxis have had 6 issues with sexual assault in the last year.""  As a company with a reputation to maintain Uber does background checks and controls who the drivers are. Being able to leave bad ratings for questionable drivers and look at a drivers profile before asking for a ride are also a huge advantage.  ""We can't prevent that in an industry we regulate 100 per cent. … My fear is the unregulated side we have no control at all.""  Yes the government should require all Uber and taxi drivers to have police checks, but Uber would do that anyway. I don't see the government's benefit to the people when their taxi regulation and licensing mean we have our current taxi system instead of Uber.  ""This could be your neighbour with dubious driving skills pulling up to pick you up and you're going to go: 'Wow, I have to drive with this guy? He scares me every time he drives by my house.'  That is exactly what Uber is about. People like to see if there are any bad ratings on a driver's profile. In addition the city doesn't have the power to remove a drivers license for slightly dubious driving but Uber does.  The main actual issue seems to be that Uber doesn't like to operate within the same constraints as a normal taxi company. They don't want to have to pay for a taxi license for every part time driver. If modifying the taxi licenses regulations is what it taxes to improve the taxi system I think that is a good option."
waterloo,2o24dc,ZinkSays,2,Tue Dec 2 19:54:39 2014 UTC,"A lot of what you say is interesting, but do you have any sources?  For instance, DOES Uber do background checks on people, or remove drivers that have poor profiles?  I do agree that having a ratings and review system would be preferred to what you currently have (which is nothing but the general reputation of the company), but I wasn't aware that Uber was that hands on in the process."
waterloo,2o24dc,Hloden,2,Wed Dec 3 15:41:14 2014 UTC,Uber says they remove poor drivers but I don't have any reliable source on that other than the company themselves and drivers who complain about being deactivated. http://blog.uber.com/feedback  As for background checks they outline how the checks work in the US on their website and they do criminal record checks in Canada. http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/tale-of-the-taxi-tape-uber-vs-traditional-cabs

waterloo,2o24dc,5hole,2,Thu Dec 4 17:26:22 2014 UTC,"""regulation"" as the only way to ensure a good customer experience    I think you misunderstand. Regulations exist to ensure access to services. Taxis are required to have the ability to transport people in wheelchairs. Does Uber have that ability? Are they required to provide transportation to all people? If not, then the law gives Uber a competitive advantage over taxis. As a society we elected politicians who enacted regulations on taxis to ensure that they are accessible to everyone. It's a douche move on our part to make taxis suffer the extra costs while Uber gets a free pass. This is just one aspect of the regulations that you and I have forced taxis to operate under.  Please note that I am not saying ""change nothing"". Only saying that it's not nearly as simple as ""taxis are bad"". It's a totally different situation than, say, the music industry's persistent refusal to acknowledge the existence of technology."
waterloo,2o24dc,webu,1 point,Tue Dec 2 21:24:39 2014 UTC,Makes sense but that wasn't mentioned in the article. They focused on regulating drivers. It seems regulations like that that apply to the company as a whole should still be enforced.

waterloo,2nu7ni,zoelovesrocco,4,Sun Nov 30 17:23:50 2014 UTC,"Minimum wage labour costs most employers a lot more than minimum wage.  You have vacation pay, benefits, paid holidays, WSIB/insurance, HR fees, and plenty of other stuff to pay for.  I would be surprised if any company managed to get away with an actualized cost much under $20/hr for any employee.  The extra above $20/hr is going to cover getting someone who actually shows up (most base minimum wagers are either unreliable or turn up like a bad penny), won't steal, can speak English or French well, and can afford to drive a car."
waterloo,2nu7ni,shepd,5,Sun Nov 30 19:09:07 2014 UTC,"Well the point was that those extra costs are actually beneficial to you. Like knowing that your cleaner will show up when you need, can be trusted to not steal, has insurance, has likely had a background check, is not going to let other people into your home etc. You don't necessarily want to hire cleaners who are paying minimum wage, never mind ones that also have no costs above minimum wage.  Yes if you care about none of that, I'm sure you can find someone to clean at roughly the same quality for much less. In that case you are assuming all the risks of the above yourself, rather than offloading them onto the cleaning company.  Also $60/hour for 2 people still seems cheap. It's double to quadruple that in Toronto."
waterloo,2nu7ni,alienangel2,2,Sun Nov 30 19:54:14 2014 UTC,"I agree with zoelovesrocco.   I hired someone from kijijii last year, she showed up with no cleaning products,  so I pulled out all my cleaning products etc.  She used all purpose cleaner on my porous wood ( and left permanent wipe marks on it), and dragged on the cleaning of my simple (and overall clean house) to 6 hours (until I asked her to leave) to get the most money she could.   I offered  hourly wage of $20 hours expecting 3 hours of cleaning.   I offered $20 to get an efficient cleaner.  After asking her a few times during the day if she could move on from washing my walls ( they had been freshly painted 6 mos earlier so were CLEAN)   WhenI finally asked her to leave after 6 hours, I still had to do  my bedroom floor on my own...yep she dragged it out on my main floor to get the most $ she could...it was bad.     btw; it took me 45 minutes to do the upstairs level she never got to....so she just dragged it out for money.   From now on, I will hire a professional company or registered business cleaner,  and $20 - $25 hours for 2-3  hours if my house is clean,  is good."
waterloo,2nu7ni,days_like_this,1 point,Sun Nov 30 20:17:08 2014 UTC,"The rule of thumb to determine the actual cost to a business for an hourly employee is to add back half of their hourly wage. (This more than capture the 4% vacation pay requirement and 'plenty other stuff to pay for' as you put it).   That works well at normal pay levels.  When you get to the extremes (low and high) it tends to be way off, because Bill Gates' dental insurance and Joe Sixpacks dental insurance is the same price (although Bill Gates probably has the top end package, there's still limits)."
waterloo,2nu7ni,shepd,2,Sun Nov 30 23:28:56 2014 UTC,"You must have missed the part where I said that it would be cheaper to just get a one person cleaner (since they only have to pay themselves) however you get what you pay for. When you hire a one person cleaner off kijiji or other site they tend to be unreliable as they often can't handle the amount of houses they have on the go, and their standards are generally lower than that of a company that employs many people. If you hire someone from kijiji and they are sick or their car breaks down or whatever they won't be able to come, so your house doesn't get cleaned. When you opt for a company then barring some really terrible weather, chances are a lot higher that you will still get your house cleaned. So it really depends on what op is looking for."

Instead of the pair on either side of Westmount nearest my home, it chooses the pair up the street.  Also, instead of realtime data it looks more like it's just taking the next scheduled time for the 8 to go past and showing a countdown timer to mimic it.

It usually seems to default to assuming every bus is going to be on schedule, even if they're obviously late. If a bus is running way behind schedule, its next three stops are listed as ""1 minute away"" even though there's no universe where you can get from (for example) the Charles St Terminal to Sportsworld in 1 minute.  When I tested the app yesterday, the scrolling sign at the iXpress stop said the next 200 was in 9 minutes, and the app said 6 minutes.

I can understand that arrival times are hard to estimate, but I don't understand how the real-time arrival data they give on their app could be so far off from the data on the scrolling signs.

I've spent some time thinking about this, and I don't think it would be so difficult to estimate arrival times. Most people I've discussed this with seem to assume that you have to do this ginormous and horribly complex set of calculations across all routes, stops and buses all at once in order to get this real-time data and how estimated arrival times to users. This isn't the case as it can be reduced a very simple of calculations  Let me run through how I imagine such a system would work and you can tell me where I've forgotten something important or made other mistakes.   the stop location and schedule data are essentially static and the only dynamic data is the bus' location and how closely it is adhering to the schedule store the stops in DB table as (stop_id, latitude, longitude, name) a rider thinks of bus schedules in a stop-centric fashion in which the individual buses are irrelevant (e.g. the route 12 goes past stop 2778 at 12:04, 12:34, 13:04, etc...) but for this service we need to think of schedules in a bus-centric manner a ""schedule"" is an ordered list of stop IDs and scheduled times that a bus is expected to run through during its working day, e.g. ((1, 2779, 12:03), (2, 2778, 12:04), (3, 2777, 12:05), ...) we can store all schedules in a single table if the columns are (schedule_id, schedule_entry, stop_id, scheduled_time) because some buses switch back and forth between 2 routes, add a column for the route that should be showing in the bus as it leaves that stop, (schedule_id, schedule_entry, stop_id, route_number, scheduled_time) the DB table for the buses is (bus_id, current_schedule_id, recent_schedule_entry, latitude, longitude, adherence) first thing in the morning a drive gets on the bus and uses that little display unit to login and set the schedule ID for that bus, ""UPDATE Buses SET current_schedule_id=1, recent_schedule_entry=0, latitude=43.424452, longitude=-80.491185, adherence=0 WHERE bus_id=21309"" the bus sends  a ping to the server with it's ID and location and the server updates the database ""UPDATE Buses  SET latitude=43.4236163, longitude -80.4893826 WHERE bud_id=21309"" and this continues periodically all day the server checks the DB to get the next stop the bus should be arriving at ""SELECT * FROM Buses WHERE bus_id=21309"", ""SELECT * FROM Schedules WHERE schedule_id=first_query_result:schedule_id, schedule_entry=first_query_result:recent_schedule_entry+1"", ""SELECT * FROM Stops WHERE stop_id=second_query_result:stop_id"". the server calculates the distance of the bus from that next stop and if it is close enough to be considered at the stop, then update the DB with that stop and the difference between the current time and scheduled time for arriving there, """"UPDATE Buses SET recent_schedule_entry=recent_schedule_entry+1, adherence=NOW() - second_query_result:scheduled_time"" repeatedly   That is all the calculations one really needs to do. Math that is taught at the grade 7 level to figure out if a bus is at a stop or not, and simple subtraction to get the adherence value, which is the true key to this solution. If the bus is scheduled to arrive at 13:04 but it arrives at 13:02, then 13:02 - 13:04 = -00:02 (or -120 second). if it arrived at 13:06, then 13:06 - 13:04 = 00:02 (or +120 seconds).  The situation is even simpler for display that data to the user.   the user opens the app (or website) which makes two HTTP requests for the list of stops and the list buses inside the map viewport so the web server does two DB queries ""SELECT * FROM Stops WHERE latitude > south_side && latitude < north_side && longitude > west_side && longitude < east_side"", ""SELECT * FROM Buses WHERE latitude > south_side && latitude < north_side && longitude > west_side && longitude < east_side"" the app requests the buses list every 60 seconds to show them moving around on the map the user taps on a bus icon so the app makes an HTTP request to the web server with that bus ID, so the web server queries the DB ""SELECT * FROM Buses WHERE bus_id=app_request:bus_id"", ""SELECT * from Schedules WHERE schedule_id=first_query:schedule_id && schedule_entry>first_query:recent_schedule_entry LIMIT 3"", then formats that data as JSON/XML/whatever and replies to the app the app now has the adherence value for that bus and its next three scheduled stop entries, so if it simply adds that adherence value to those scheduled times, it gets the estimated arrival time for that bus at its next three stops the user taps on a stop icon so the app makes an HTTP request to the web server with that stop ID, the web server queries the DB, ""SELECT * FROM Schedules JOIN Buses ON Schedules.schedule_id=Buses.schedule_id WHERE Schedules.stop_id=app_query:stop_id LIMIT 3"" formats the data and sends it back to the app the app now has the next three buses that are scheduled to arrive at that stop along with the adherence value for each bus, so the app simply has to ad that value to the scheduled time to get the estimated arrival times   As you can see, in my scheme getting the estimated arrival time is done on the fly, off-loaded from the server(s) at the GRT to user's phone or browser and all the server has to do is the simple task of determining how far ahead or behind a bus is at any given reporting ping.  The only complexity in the whole process would be if one were to try and optimize the database queries with more subselects and joins in order to do fewer of them and avoid caching query results to interpolate into the next one. However, that really only affects how much compute power you'd need to handle this for a given user level, not how you'd determine the estimated arrival times.  Eye-balling the real-time map, there's currently about 3 dozen buses in service, so let's say that during peak times in morning and evening that doubles to 6 dozen. Assuming the buses ping every 15 seconds then the server has to be able to handle an average of 4.8 pings per second at peak rush. If the stops are an average of 1 minute apart, only 1.2/s will be the pings that require the 5 (unoptimized) queries and the other 3.6 q/s will be the single update query. A cheap dual core desk could probably handle around 100 simple SQL queries like this per second with about 25% CPU usage since much of the data will cached in memory even with only 4GB RAM.  As for app user load, GRT ridership in 2010 was 62k per day average and increasing at 3x population growth, so say 76k now, and 50% of Canadians had a smartphone in 2013 so let's say 75% of riders in tech-heavy Waterloo region. Assuming each person generates two rides per day, that's a possible 28.5k people using the app on the way to work in the morning for peak usage. Each app open is 2 queries for the map, each tap on a stop is 1 query per minute, so if each rider keeps it open for 10 minutes until the bus arrives that's 342k SQL queries and 313.5k HTTP queries. Evenly distributed from 7-9am that's an average of 47.5 and 43.5 queries per second. That's still only 52.3 SQL queries per second at peak, so unless I have significantly low-balled my guesstimates, this is something a low-end rackmount 1U server with a single quad-core CPU and 8Gb memory could handle both the SQL database and web server parts with significant leeway for usage growth."
waterloo,2ns432,Dynehart,2,Mon Dec 1 21:32:03 2014 UTC,"I was being charitable when I said arrival times could be hard to estimate... hard to pin down to the second, when you have traffic delays, extra loading/unloading time, etc. But given that GRT is one of the last transit companies in the region to offer real-time data, these problems should all have been solved a long time ago. If you were able to come up with that solution in less than a day, the companies that have been working on this for years should have even more robust solutions.  My main point was that the ""real-time"" data on their app sometimes differs from the ""real-time"" data on the signs at the bus stops, which doesn't make sense. They've obviously had a system in place for estimating arrival times at bus stops for years, which seems to be working pretty well. So why does the mobile app seem to use a different system - the scrolling sign knows that my bus has already came and went, but the app thinks it is arriving in 3 minutes."

Damn it is SLOW. :( It doesn't find stops near me very well and when I went into the map to manually pick my nearest stop, I had to tap the stop name many times before it finally registered my action and finally showed me the page for the stop. I added it to my favourites and I guess I'll check in on it every so often to see how well the app works, but right now I don't see this replacing the app I already used (GRTransit). It's just too slow and unresponsive right now, and doesn't offer any extra features that were lacking in existing third-party schedule apps."

I never said that it was, only that the service is available for the Region to use.   Only a small handful have it.   It's not one of the ones mentioned in that video, no, but that was merely the announcement of start of this service so of course there was only a small handful. Currently any transit provider that give Google the static data is also allowed to set up the complementary real-time feed.    GRT data is provided to google by GRT. They would have to be piping out the live GPS data, and I find that pretty doubtful.   Yes, I am familiar with GTFS and how the static data is provided and I know what it would require to provide real-time data.  But I'm still saying they should have done that work to interface with Google instead of their own clunky website and half-working app. It's not unreasonable to say that tooling up to provide this real-time data to Google in the necessary format would have only required as much work as designing and implementing the private API they've made to support their own website and app. Given that Protocol Buffers is fairly simple and comes with code-generating utilities it might even have been simpler to do.  And had they done so they could have skipped the time and expense of writing a clunky real-time website and publishing a half-baked app and instead have had a smooth, easy to use, cross-platform service hosted inside an application that people who want to use this service would almost certainly be already be very familiar with."

waterloo,2nt0fq,FeedMyFlame,3,Sun Nov 30 01:17:40 2014 UTC,"Well, if you're a boarder, you can move out at will without penalty.  For that right, you also are at risk of dealing with crap roommates or landlords, generally with the sole remedy of GTFO.  However, it is illegal to use Last Month's Rent as security.  Any landlord doing this is to be reported to the Landlord Tenant Board.  They will return it faster than you can imagine.  It's simply flat out illegal.  City hall will help you deal with the landlord tenant board, but there are some upfront fees, unfortunately (you can try to claim them from the Landlord).  The police in K/W simply do not deal with civil matters unless ordered to by the court.  Found that out when I called about a crazy customer who wouldn't pay me.  :)  So ignore their pointless threats on that, they will need to go through the LTB to get that money back, and since they didn't pay you LMR (apparently) the LTB already despises them.  I would suggest toning down the language regarding how angry you are at the landlords for your legal sake (if they really are nuts you never know...) and shorten your post, because it's unlikely new tenants are going to read to the bottom to figure out who these people are.  :)"
waterloo,2nt0fq,shepd,1 point,Sun Nov 30 19:49:34 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately boarder agreements don't fall under the RTA, so they have nothing to do with it. And yes, I could leave whenever I want, but as I already paid the first and last month's rent, I would basically be leaving when I already paid for the month. Even under the RTA, there's an extremely long and tedious process waiting for the hearing where if it's not a huge sum of money it simply isn't worth the time and energy to pursue it.   As for the language, I'm expressing how I feel. They are nuts/psychotic, but honestly even courts can detect their BS from a mile way.

waterloo,2nt0fq,canadianviking,3,Mon Dec 1 01:15:34 2014 UTC,"This post does not give me much sympathy for you.  First, you don't catch a cold from being cold. Second, I keep my house at 64 in the night because I find it comfortable for sleeping. If you live in someone else's house, you need to agree on some basics. Ask when you check out the place how warm they keep it, if they mind if you turn the heat up, how often they have friends over late.  I have had many boarders over the years and I don't mind reminding them that it's MY HOUSE.  They are paying a low amount for the room and access to common areas, but I'm not going to change my living habits for someone paying $450 a month.  If you can't handle that, you should save up and rent an apartment or get roommates in a more democratic situation."
waterloo,2nt0fq,canadianviking,2,Sun Nov 30 22:40:29 2014 UTC,"70 degrees fahrenheit is standard room temperature and the requirement that RTA expects you to keep to make the place liveable. When I came to see the place it was 72 degrees. It's not so much a matter of differences, it's the fact that they have zero respect for anyone else and they set double standards. They intentionally misrepresented the place so they could get their hands on the money.  If you're renting out your place, you are EXPECTED to make some compromises. You can't expect someone else to live like a mouse just because it's your place. And if you're used to having the house below the average temperature, that should be made clear BEFORE someone moves in. So you're saying that because it is YOUR place, someone else can't make legit complaints and you can just do whatever you want, essentially?  For the record, my parents have two houses in Toronto-one of which is fully rented out, and one which we have a few rooms rented out and we treat every one of our tenants with respect and courtesy."

Does that mean resumes are completely useless, and people are exclusively getting hired because of family/friends connections? I doubt it. Competition is hard, and you have to make your job application stand out. How many of those resumes you handed out were the exact same copy? I bet all of them.  Tailor every single resume to each location you are applying to provide the most relevant information! Here's the reality, as somebody who was on the side of the table that had to read through resumes and decide who to pass them on: Grammar matters, professionalism matters, relevant information within the top 30% of the first page matters, I'll take a look at your academics if you don't have any relevant work experience, and maybe glance at your awards/accomplishments, but guess what? Reading resumes is not my main job, it's what I do when I need a break from working on my projects. I'll glance at a few, recycle the irrelevant ones, and take the rest back to my team/peers for review when we all have a moment.  Having said that, here's what I want to see when you send in a resume:   Name on top, contact information on the side, not hidden but not a filler either. First line, tell me what job you're seeking. It better be something we're hiring for, or else it's in the discard pile. Second section, tell me why you'll be good at it. List previous experience working with whatever to give me an idea of your skills and talents. If I'm asking for C++ Experience in my job posting, I expect to see similar languages in your skills category. Don't list any more than 7 skills, and be sure to list them by relevance to the job. If it's a tester position, I want to see testing suites you've used. If it's a management position, I want to see how many years and size of team you've managed. List by relevance, this means if I'm looking for a cashier and your first skill listed is snow shovelling, you go in the discard pile.  Third section - academics if you recently came out of school, otherwise job history. Starting month/year, ending month/year. I want to see you've kept yourself busy even through layoffs and downtime (I understand family emergencies happen, but 2 years without a job, not even freelance/contract work sounds bad if you weren't raising a kid or taking care of elderly looks bad). Chronological order from most recent to latest. Keep it short, keep it relevant. For each job, I want to see you highlight the skills that are directly relevant to the position you are applying. Yes, you might have been a dish-washer during your time at a restaurant as well as a waitress, but if you are applying to a customer-facing job like an account manager, I expect you to list waitressing duties above dish-washing duties. In fact, don't even list dish-washing duties, it's irrelevant and takes up space. Last section is miscellaneous information, try to keep it relevant again. Volunteered some place you love? Put it down - great conversation piece. Won 3rd place at a hot dog eating contest? Sure - as long as you want to talk about it at an interview. Won 2nd prize at a hackathon and applying to a programming job? Definitely put it down, don't even hesitate. Lastly, very importantly, make sure that your resume fits on AT MOST 2 pages, formatted nicely, plenty of white space and short-concise points that are easy to digest. Make sure there are no speling mysticks and use proper grammar. Once you have a decent resume base, you can use it over and over again, and changes take no more than 30 minutes by the time you're used to it.   Cover letters are nice, I like them but not everyone does. If you choose to write a cover letter, explain what you are looking for clearly, use proper grammar, spelling, etc. Be concise and to the point, explain why you are good at what you do and give a short summary of the most important points from the resume. Your cover letter should not be more than 1 page long.  Sorry for the wall of text, but this is super basic stuff I see being done wrong quite frequently. Basically, try to put yourself in the shoes of the person looking through the job applications, what would they want to see? A bad hire could cost a company, even a Timmies, thousands of dollars through opportunity cost and actual cost (in wages). For a tech startup, the risk is even higher, thus people tend to err on the side of caution.  Good luck in your search, please clean up your language, and hope for the best. If you want to be more proactive, find places to volunteer your good back and computer literacy.  Final thought: You didn't mention attention to detail, this is the number one flaw of unexperienced workers - they miss the small details on an order, assignment, or requirement, and it ends up costing huge. This, along with having trouble taking criticism accounts for more layoffs and firings than incompetence and unethical behaviour combined.  Edit: formatting"
waterloo,2nlh32,dSolver,9,Thu Nov 27 19:48:31 2014 UTC,"Does that mean resumes are completely useless, and people are exclusively getting hired because of family/friends connections?    I'm not a sexy resume candidate. And the fact of the matter is I don't have an anglo name, blue eyes, or am female. But I can show up, work harder than everyone else there, be appreciative of being given a chance, and ask for help or look up what I need to know when I am challenged. I will show up on time, crisply dressed, sober, no drama. Not a diva, will do any job - I have no ego because ego doesn't pay the bills."
waterloo,2nlh32,whitewhim,6,Thu Nov 27 20:53:31 2014 UTC,"You and every other candidate want to convey that message, but who gets the message through, that's the question.  You say you will show up and work harder than everyone else there - am I supposed to just take your word for it? No - give me examples. If you have an impressive stat backing up your claim - # of sales closed, amount of information researched, number of projects completed, that's awesome. If you don't have hard stats, give me some sign that your hard work has paid off in the past - promotions, employee of the month, etc.  You say you are appreciative of being given a chance, that's great, but I'm not looking for people who are thankful, I'm looking for people who will fit in well with their co-workers. Don't tell me you're thankful on the resume, tell me you're thankful on the cover letter. Tell me how good you are at working with other people. You can be strong as an ox, but we don't need an ox to stock shelves or run mail, we need good team players. Give me examples of when you were on a team - sports, community, heck even gaming leagues.  You say you'll ask for help and look up information when you're challenged, great - that's a big point to bring up in the cover letter or interview, but this is expected of everybody, and is one of the first things I'll catch if a new employee isn't doing their work well.  You say you will show up on time, crisply dressed, sober, no drama. How many people have you worked with that aren't that? I'm really curious. Don't bring up this point, it is an unspoken expectation. We're not in the ghettos, hiring drug addicts and alcoholics, we are hiring people who can function as expected, the very fact that  you brought this up means you have a much lower standard. I suggest hiding that. What do you want to look for in a co-worker? That's what you want to strive to convince me you are.  You are clearly desperate, and you say you have no ego - there are plenty of jobs out there that you would probably say no to, I don't believe for a moment that you truly have no ego. As I said above, for each resume, tell me exactly which position you are looking for. If you're looking for a general labourer job, write that. If you are looking to fill a cashier position, fill that. The resume isn't where the job application ends, it's where it begins. You can always tell them you are open to other positions at the interview."

waterloo,2msvlo,daddywombat,2,Wed Nov 26 03:37:15 2014 UTC,"You're going to be looking at $150/tire at the lowest possible end of the spectrum.  Suck it up and pay at least $160-$180 per and drive confidently in most winter driving conditons. You will do yourself a favour to get dedicated winter rims for your winter tires. Whatever you do, DO NOT drive on your winter tires when spring rolls around, they will wear out much quicker and drain your gas tank with increased rolling resistance.  Go with costco as they are your best option the well into the season."

waterloo,2m37xz,carbonnanotube,-7,Thu Nov 13 16:11:52 2014 UTC,I think that's a total bullshit opinion. Chiros don't believe you can cure all diseases by manipulating bones. They perform ART to loosen the muscles around specific joint and adjust that particular joint to increase movement again which relieves pain. They also give you stretches and exercises to do on your own to work on the painful area yourself to strengthen the weak muscles that are causing the pain. They deal with more chronic issues where a physio will deal with acute problems that need daily or weekly therapy.
waterloo,2m37xz,hambwner,6,Thu Nov 13 02:20:48 2014 UTC,"This is chiropractic:    ""Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by Daniel David Palmer, a grocer with an intense interest in metaphysics. Prior to his “discovery” of chiropractic, D.D. Palmer was a magnetic healer. He also had interests in phrenology (diagnosing disease based on the bumps of the skull) and spiritualism. Palmer reported to have discovered the principle of chiropractic when he allegedly cured a janitor of his deafness by manipulating his neck. The fact that the nerve which conveys sound information from the ears to the brain does not pass through the neck did not seem to bother Palmer, if he was even aware of this fact.  Palmer created the term “chiropractic,” which literally means “done by hand,” to refer to his new therapy. He argued that all disease is caused by subluxated bones, which 95% of the time are spinal bones, and which disrupt the flow of innate intelligence. He did not subject his ideas to any form of research, but rather went directly to treating patients and to teaching his principles to the first generation of chiropractors.""   From your response, This is that physiotherapists do.     They also give you stretches and exercises to do on your own to work on the painful area yourself to strengthen the weak muscles that are causing the pain.    If you are going to a chiropractor to get physical therapy (which is actually effective) then you are just seeing an under-qualified physiotherapist."

waterloo,2m37xz,carbonnanotube,3,Thu Nov 13 15:06:49 2014 UTC,"Chiropractic is based on pseudoscience principles that have either been proven to be false (Such as their bread and butter ""sublaxation"") or haven't been tested at all.   All of that training means nothing if they look at actual science and still decide to hitch their names to a field which is clearly not evidence based. You could spend hundreds of hours training how to flap your arms to fly but that does not mean you become a bird.   Related: http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/105/4/e43.full.pdf  Looking into the topic I ran into quite a few interesting studies done, and the most damning is here: J Manipulative Physiol Ther. 2005 Jun;28(5):336-44, with an analysis below:    So, what they did was give a test to on basic primary care to three groups of chiropractic students in their final terms in chiropractic college (groups 1, 2 and 3) and one group of recent medical school graduates who had yet to start residency. The test was created by ""2 DCs who also hold bachelor's degrees, 1 DC with a diplomate in radiology, a DC enrolled in the final year of a radiology residency program, and 2 MDs"". It was a 100 question test broken into two 50 question sections and some description of attempts to validate the instrument for use on chiropractic students is offered by the authors. So here is what they found...  Group 1: 21 students, raw scores 32.7, % scores 65.4, SD 4.6 Group 2: 22 students, raw scores 28, % scores 56, SD 5 Group 3: 79 students, raw scores 32.1, % scores 64.2, SD 4.4 Groups 1 to 3 (combined): 122 students, raw scores 31.4, % scores 62.8, SD 4.7 Group 4: 20 students, raw scores 36.7, % scores 73.4, SD 3.3  Now, while the medical student sample size is low, the performance of the chiropractic students is abyssmally low. 68% of all of the chiropractic students (who are very soon to enter practice) taking the test, a test designed and validated by DCs, scored between 58.1% and 67.5%?!? This is noteworthy? Yes, it is! It succinctly proves the point that DCs are very ill prepared to serve as primary care physicians. As for the medical students, 68% scored between 70.1% and 76.7%. While I would normally bristle at these data as the sample size is so small, it should be noted that the SD was the narrowest, by a considerable amount, in this group. This leads me to question the need to validate the instrument not only with chiropractic students (as was done) but also with medical students (not done in this study). These results seem to indicate a very tight ""clumping"" of scores in the medical student group, which may suggest that areas of the test represented material outside their scope of instruction.  Other results: Percentage scores of all students on 5 major categories of primary care tasks Primary care activities (% correct) Information gathering Group 1 - 60.12, 2 - 57.04, 3 - 64.72, 4 - 76.64 Screening and prevention Group 1 - 35.72, 2 - 27.09, 3 - 38.93, 4 - 63.10 Other diagnostic procedures Group 1 - 66.94, 2 - 57.64, 3 - 65.83, 4 - 74.34 Counseling and education Group 1 - 69.05, 2 - 75.00, 3 - 87.74, 4 - 95.24 Management of acute/chronic conditions Group 1 - 65.71, 2 - 57.04, 3 - 64.69, 4 - 73.01  By these data, chiropractic does not perform information gathering or screening and prevention well at all.  I'm not going to post the data on all individual ""subcategories of management of acute and chronic conditions"". Suffice it to say that group four handily out performed all of the other groups in every area except one: Musculoskeletal (% correct) Group 1 - 71.04, 2 - 56.95, 3 - 54.75, 4 - 48.02 (but group four did outperform the others in neuro!: Neurological (% correct) Group 1 - 78.1, 2 - 61.67, 3 - 78.99, 4 - 82.86)  My most significant concern on their methodology is this - the test was given to medical students about to enter residency training and to final term chiropractic students about to enter practice (presumably). Now, the article acknowledges a gap, but that gap should only grow as the medical students have at least three years of training remaining. Also, no attempt was made to identify what area of medicine the MD students were entering. I would argue that given the latitude to self direct fourth year cirricula to a certain degree, students heading into primary care would likely outperform a random sample from all medical students on this examination as they would have more training in this area than the ""average"" medical student.  Lastly, the conclusions (as Public Health points out) do not match the data. It is not ""noteworthy"", in a positive sense, that chiropractic students about to enter the workforce score abyssmally low on a test of basic primary care skills. Comparing them to MD graduates with at least three years of training remaining is comparing apples and oranges. And even given the disparity in time remaining in training, the MD students quite significantly outperformed the chiropractors. This paper completely demonstrates what I have been saying since I started coming to this forum. Chiropractors are not equipped to act as primary care physicians.   I might sound like I am being very harsh about the subject, but it is deserved. People who go out and try to sell snake oil to desperate people who are willing to try anything are despicable.   It is interesting as well, chiropractors had the chance to flip over and become legitimate through acknowledging that the only thing that their ""craft"" has ever been shown to better than a placebo treating is back pain, although it is no more effective than traditional methods offered by doctors and physiotherapists."

Only complaint is that phone support hold times can be a bit long, however on the TekSavvy direct forum on DSL reports I have always gotten quick help.

waterloo,2lw9qw,webu,7,Mon Nov 10 21:31:18 2014 UTC,"Cable internet, Teksavvy is just fine imo. They are built on top of the Rogers network though, so if you're setting up, it's up to Rogers to register you in. The time it takes to get service up and running is therefore some time between 3 days and 30 days. Rogers can be jerks to Teksavvy customers.  I go with their 300GB per month limit, it's far more than I'll need, I doubt I even crack 10% of that per month. However, I do like my internet fast, so I have 28mbps (not even the fastest available).  You can ""zap the cap"" - by taking a hit during rush hour - 6pm - 10pm IIRC, where your service will be reduced to something like 8mbps and in return you will have unlimited usage. This is clearly good for less lazy/smarter people who download their content overnight or during the day to consume at 6 - 10pm."

waterloo,2lw9qw,Fin2limb,5,Mon Nov 10 22:11:03 2014 UTC,"Sorry in advance - since I know you specified either Rogers or TekSavvy. I just wanted to mention, since I was once in the same boat, that another option might be Start.ca. They also resell off of the Rogers network, and if you currently have a Rogers connection there's a very good chance your setup fee will be waived. I haven't had a bad experience with them yet - their customer service (when I've ever needed it) has so far been helpful and knowledgeable - though they (like TekSavvy) will sometimes get screwed by having to rely on Rogers technicians and thus what feels like second-tier service quality.  Between the two (cable or DSL) I would argue that there's a market for both options, a lower tier cable connection will roughly match most of the higher tier DSL options (excluding FTTN) - and so it depends on your usage/requirements to determine which is most appropriate. If in doubt, I'd argue for the cable connection over a DSL connection, since you have the room to get higher speeds if they're available. It's possible to get higher speeds on a DSL connection (with FTTN), but it depends heavily on whether your area has been updated to support it.  I can't speak for TekSavvy's plans since I haven't gone with them - at the time I switched to Start, TekSavvy still required you to purchase your own modem, whereas I was more comfortable renting one than buying one (Start will let you buy your own as well, obviously). I believe, like TekSavvy, you have the ability to use late-night service with any capped plan to get unlimited data. The way it works with Start is that you have a regular cap, but any downloads between 2am and 8am don't count towards your cap. You can also just straight up pay for an unlimited cap. You can estimate how high a cap you need based on your average usage per day, or if you have access to your history with Rogers you should be able to see past usage.  In terms of what kind of bandwidth you need, it depends on what you'll be using it for.   Skype calls will typically use about 3 Mbps down, 512 Kbps up. Netflix (high quality) uses about 6-16 Mbps which is about 3-7 GB per hour YouTube videos will probably have the same bandwidth requirements as Netflix, though if you don't typically watch videos in high quality it won't take as much bandwidth   Most service providers won't count uploads towards your cap (I know Start doesn't, at least), so you don't need to worry too much about your ""up"" speed, but I'd recommend 1Mbps up as a minimum. Given the above bandwidth averages, I'd recommend 15Mbps down as a minimum, but if you're sharing that connection with other users to appropriately increase that speed (my household is set up with 25Mbps down so that there's still some bandwidth available should one person start a movie on Netflix).  Hope that helps!"

waterloo,2lna10,alienangel2,6,Sat Nov 8 20:15:14 2014 UTC,"Haven't been there in a few years, but from what I remember:   Laurier is right in the middle of Waterloo, so assuming you're living on or near campus you will be fine for finding stuff to do. You are also a ~10-15 minute walk from the U. Waterloo campus (or a shorter bus ride), so there's generally plenty of stuff to do at the campuses and in the intervening area. Compared to Toronto, Waterloo has a pretty small-town feel; I don't know how that compares to NB though. It's not rural by any stretch (to get to farmland you probably need to drive a good 20 minutes), but it's spread out and quiet and you won't see crowds of people anywhere other than on campus. Given that it has 2 large universities and a burgeoning tech sector (Google and RIM both have large dev offices in KW, along with many other tech companies) there's still usually quite a lot to do; various clubs and bars, restaurants, a couple of decent malls. Not too sure about live music, I know there were some spots for it (Symposium comes to mind). You can always grab a bus to Toronto for a night out on the town, Waterloo is adjacent to Kitchener, which is another small town with its own set of stuff to do. I wouldn't bank on walking most places. There's plenty within walking distance of campus, but you'll likely still want to use the bus system to go the mall or the movie theatre or down to Kitchener now and then. I think Laurier (and definitely UW) students get a bus pass automatically, so students use busses a lot even just to travel between campuses or between housing and class. I think there's a lot of talk about a light rail system now too, but I don't know when/if that's happening."

I've been living in Waterloo, attending Laurier for 5 years now, one of the best decisions I've made in my life.  Waterloo has good bars within walking distance to the university campus.

waterloo,2lna10,kildoents,1 point,Sat Nov 8 12:43:09 2014 UTC,"""Only an hour away from Toronto"" is optimistic - if you're driving late at night that might be true, but other times you could get stuck for hours on the 401. If you're taking the Greyhound then it's a 1.5 hour trip plus 30 minutes waiting in line - just long enough that heading to Toronto just for an evening isn't very enticing. Hopefully that will change within the next 10 years if the promised 45-minute GO train service comes through, but we've been hearing that for a long time.  As for live music, it depends on what you enjoy. If you like going to a pub and seeing some local dude play guitar (or being one of those local dudes) then you're in luck. But for touring bands we actually get a lot less than other college towns. There's only one place that regularly has touring bands, The Starlight, and they mainly book Canadian indie. The good news is that the abovementioned Maxwell's Music House has closed... and is opening a new 900-seat venue on December 12th. The owners were on Reddit a few months ago and said they're going to try and get the type of bands that the Phoenix in Toronto gets, which would be transformative for the music scene here.  There's also the annual Kitchener Blues festival, which is free and has big-name blues acts, a Waterloo Jazz festival, and a Kitchener ""indie"" festival that's mostly emo bands. And a decently active house-show scene with lots of smaller punk and rock bands (ie Metz used to play in basements and back rooms here before being signed to Sub Pop)."

For example, RIM Park is a 1 hour walk away from WLU.  However, the bus service will get you to those places.  It can also take you to Toronto."

waterloo,2lg3bo,5hole,4,Thu Nov 6 15:15:50 2014 UTC,This is a collision if two extreme worlds: fast flying Internet technologies and the snail's pace of municipal government.

waterloo,2lg3bo,thelatestmodel,4,Fri Nov 7 21:48:21 2014 UTC,Hiring people to work in the department does not automatically mean the service is coming to the area.   The positions you mention were for engineers to develop a Google Fiber mobile app. Nothing to do with setting it up here at all.

waterloo,2lfkom,mpd618,5,Thu Nov 6 02:10:39 2014 UTC,the 7 routes were and are among the most important in the city especially to students. the 7 routes should have its own ixpress and not be consolidated with the 200 ixexpress. way too many people and students included use them. the 7's go to all the nooks and crannies that other buses dont.  also to cut off the 7 routes especially in ring road will make student life harder and maybe unsafer for those travelling at night. people that  take the ring road bus will now have to travel by foot. if anything more service should be added to 7 routes.  waterloo has been going in the right direction with city development but this is a bad move.

waterloo,2ldsxc,shepd,8,Wed Nov 5 17:39:56 2014 UTC,"KW hands out hack licenses, no longer doing so would not only affect city revenue, but it would also affect longstanding agreements with the limited number of taxi companies.  My last car became mine because a Cambridge driver decided they wanted to be a taxi driver.  They bought an old CVPI for the hack license, transferred it to something they preferred to drive, and sold the license-less car.  For interest's sakes, here's how many licenses were handed out in 2012:  0.  In fact, 0 will be handed out until there's 650,000 people in the region.  http://www.therecord.com/news-story/2619205-region-turns-down-taxi-drivers-request-to-limit-new-licences/"
waterloo,2ldsxc,BorusBorus,5,Wed Nov 5 18:55:43 2014 UTC,"The region is in control of both the availability of taxi licenses (based on a taxi to population ratio) and the price of taxi rides. I don't see how this restrictive combination is good for the public. If Uber were allowed to operate freely in the area, more people would quickly realize you can receive better, cheaper transportation service than that from the existing taxi companies."
waterloo,2ldsxc,shepd,3,Wed Nov 5 19:11:10 2014 UTC,"I completely agree.  The old saw is that supposedly the service quality will go down and safety for taxi drivers will decrease.  Also, safety for passengers will decrease.  Frankly, I don't believe any of that.  Today's services allow very accurate verification of the driver and his history with the company.  This creates a safe environment for the passenger.  Uber should also be able to screen passengers, creating the safe environment for the driver.  As for service quality and ride safety, one can only hope Uber doesn't keep drivers with poor feedback."
waterloo,2ldsxc,BorusBorus,10,Wed Nov 5 19:16:37 2014 UTC,"The cashless experience of Uber is a far safer experience than a traditional cab, in my opinion. With Uber, every part of your trip is logged via the app. Also, the identities of all passengers and drivers are fully known to Uber because everyone needs to attach financial information to their account in order to use the service.  It's just a better service than traditional taxis."
waterloo,2ldsxc,BorusBorus,5,Wed Nov 5 19:34:08 2014 UTC,"As /u/whitewhim also said, it is quite disappointing. My girlfriend and I were considering signing up, but immediately forgot about that when this article was published.

waterloo,2ldsxc,whitewhim,3,Wed Nov 5 18:07:28 2014 UTC,"It would be interesting to see if Uber is willing to have someone stand as a test case. Ie. Have them drive and then when they get a ticket, challenge it in court with a full set of lawyers. Although I'm not really familiar with the legal system and I've heard it is not as easy to set a precedent for a case in Canada as in the US."
waterloo,2ldsxc,shepd,2,Thu Nov 6 02:44:03 2014 UTC,"If you drive the correct sort of vehicle, you can avoid being classed as a taxi.  I have no idea how I came across it, but you need 6+ 7+ 8+ seats in your vehicle.  Kind of wasteful, but most minivans and some SUVs would not be considered a taxi.  Chances are you'd get tickets and have to fight it in court anyways.  And I could be wrong.  Those getting tickets right now could find the mistake of using ""less"" instead of ""fewer"" in the law helpful to them, as ""individuals"" are a count item.  http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regionalGovernment/resources/by-law%2004-069.pdf  (20) ""Taxi-cab"" means a Motor Vehicle that is equipped with a Taxi-cab Meter that has a seating capacity for six (6) or less individuals, exclusive of the driver  Also important, the fine for being an Uber driver is up to $25,000.  If you incorporate, another $5,000 fine may be levied.  EDIT:  Read CrazedLumberjack's post.  You'll need 8 seats, since the driver is excluded.  That leaves the Tahoe, Yukon, Expedition, Durango, and Excursion as possible vehicles.  Not certain if stuffing a ""backseat"" bench into the middle of a minivan counts, since it isn't a factory 8th seat.  Really dumb policy."
waterloo,2ldsxc,BorusBorus,2,Wed Nov 5 18:54:13 2014 UTC,"The other interesting thing about this is that UberX drivers won't have traditional Taxi-cab Meters, so they wouldn't meet the region's definition of taxis."

waterloo,2ldsxc,PaeTar,1 point,Thu Nov 6 18:28:37 2014 UTC,"Holding off doesn't help you, only hurts drivers trying to make a buck. You should use the service so that interest goes up in this kind of offering, and ridership of outdated taxi model of business goes down. Uber might not be the best company for this, but it is the first one in the area. Eventually competitors will move in and may offer even better service."
waterloo,2ldsxc,thelatestmodel,8,Fri Feb 6 15:16:19 2015 UTC,"Reading Angelo Apfelbaum's quote made it crystal clear - ""All taxicab operators must abide by a set fee schedule approved by regional council. Uber doesn't abide by the region's fare rules.""   Right. That's why it's awesome. You're just trying to keep your money-grab going. This is like the oil companies trying to stifle solar, the music industry trying to sue people downloading MP3s, the cable companies trying to stifle municipal broadband, you name it.   You're always going to get some pushback - people standing in the way of legitimate progress, just to keep the existing, archaic system going.  Very disappointed to hear that the region are doing this."
waterloo,2ldsxc,bgb_ca,2,Wed Nov 5 20:05:47 2014 UTC,"Uh hate to rain on your parade but they are not perfect. Use them during ""peak times"" and fares jump by as much as 10x  I'm not defending the taxi companies though as they overcharge as it is, but Uber is not the perfect solution."
waterloo,2ldsxc,thelatestmodel,5,Wed Nov 5 20:39:55 2014 UTC,"Taxis charge peak fares too. Doesn't seem like much of a counter-argument, with all due respect."
waterloo,2ldsxc,bgb_ca,6,Wed Nov 5 20:50:44 2014 UTC,"Uh, while they can charge flat rates, you can ask for the meter rate instead and those cannot be increased.  http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regionalGovernment/resources/04-070.pdf  For example, most of them charge 90 bucks to go to Pearson. You can pay the 90 dollar flat rate, or gamble and ask for the metered rate instead. The metered rate may be above or below, but this needs to be agreed on before.   Uber rates for Toronto are  Base fare  $2.75 base fare + $0.30 per minute + $0.90 Per kilometer which would be cheaper than a taxi in most cases, however during their ""Surge"" days, they can charge say 6.25x the rate (As per the screen shot in their blog link below) then those fares become $17.18 base fare + $1.87 per minute + $5.62 per kilometer, while the city metered rate must stay the same.  If a licensed taxi tries to charge you more than the regulated rate, then you can file a complaint with the region, however if Uber does, you can't.   While I am all for lower rates, and think the Taxi monopoly should be broken, Uber is not the savior everyone is making it out to be.   https://www.uber.com/cities/toronto http://blog.uber.com/2012/01/03/surge-pricing-followup/"
waterloo,2ldsxc,shepd,2,Wed Nov 5 21:17:25 2014 UTC,"Preventing drivers from charging what their service is worth seems like a bad idea, so long as there is no monopoly on drivers and it is an easy gig to get into.  I'd say without regulations, there's few occupations easier to get into than being a taxi driver.  That means if unregulated peak fares skyrocketed, you can bet I'd quit my not too bad job I already have and rush out for the cash grab.  Then again, I'd probably wait a couple of weeks because by that time the prices will be back to what the service is really worth."
waterloo,2ldsxc,BorusBorus,2,Wed Nov 5 23:01:03 2014 UTC,"Keep in mind that when you order an UberX ride, you can get an estimate of what your fare will be before using the service. Also, if surge pricing is in effect, it is made immediately apparent to you in the app, and the app also requires you to acknowledge that you've been informed about the current surge price modifier by entering the exact value of the modifier.  I believe the Uber app gives you enough information to make a smart decision about what method of transportation would be most economical, and I also believe that UberX trips will be your best bang for your buck the majority of the time."

waterloo,2ldnpv,IUseRhetoric,4,Thu Nov 6 20:47:03 2014 UTC,I'm quite happy with Clark Animal Hospital near Ottawa and Homer-Watson.  Not the cheapest but they have always been honest with me and they have been very gentle with our pets.
waterloo,2ldnpv,evilsteff,3,Wed Nov 5 17:12:25 2014 UTC,"Second for Clark Animal Hospital on Alpine road.  They are great at taking the time to explain everything in detail, and their pricing is competitive. What's also great about them is they gave my cat a shot of antibiotics for his urinary infection, so I didn't have to try to shove pills down his throat. When I shopped around the second time he got an infection, they were the only vet I called that offered this."

We have found 2 that have the best rates mixed with honest professional veterinarian's. Best place in kitchener is Clark Animal Hospital. Amazing vet!!! He does such a great job and charges the most honest rates I've run into. Our main choice is Lexington Rd. Animal Hospital in Waterloo, our puppy's leg broke and we came into here and have never been given the service we have recieved here. We were low on funds and were in past closing hours and were not pushed out or felt rushed or anything we felt so takin in  and cared for by these people and just made the ""shit"" situation so much better. They genuinely care about you and your pet!! Now we have gone to a vet on bridgeport and he purposely messed up a surgery so we would have to go back in for more meds. We found this out by bringing our cat into a different vet who claimed the last vet ""sabotaged"" our animal on purpose. This was Buck Animal Hospital. Now it was years ago and things could have changed since then. But we were so enraged by the service that was provided I have no problem saying ""don't go there"" everybody has a different experience everywhere they go. I can say when it comes to surgery don't skip out and get the best there is to offer  As our puppy broke his leg we were recommended to the University of Guelph Animal Hospital. Amazing! They did such a great job and yes it was expensive but it was surgery so can't expect it to be ""cheap"""

waterloo,2kvw98,isUsername,7,Fri Oct 31 14:14:38 2014 UTC,"At first I was all ""Yay! They finally did this!""  But after looking at it I am rather underwhelmed.   on Android Chrome I had to chose the ""Request desktop site"" option to get anything other than a blank page map frame is inappropriately sized for use on a mobile device cannot tap on a bus icon on mobile device to get the popup ETAs to the next three stops cannot tap on a stop dot on a mobile device to get the popup next three bus scheduled times map does not update in PC browser if you have one of those popups displayed the page does not use your location to zoom the map in to where you are to show you an appropriate subset of the info reloading the page resets to the wide view, no cookies appear maintain any data for that zooming in to your location without selecting a route does not show you the route or stops if you select a route after zooming in, you get zoomed back out to display the whole route you cannot chose multiple route at the same time you cannot tell which direction the buses are going without zooming in and waiting for two or three 30 second refreshes   Given that it took them several years from when they announced that real-time GPS data of the buses would be made available, I am surprised at the lack of extra usefulness of this map over stock Google Maps.  The stop popup only tells you what you can get from the EasyGO SMS reply - the next three scheduled buses. The bus popup only tells you the ETA at the next three stops without mentioning whether it's behind or if it's early.  Because the page doesn't request location data from the browser, you have to move and zoom in manually. Combine that with the desktop browser layout, which makes those controls tiny and all but unusable on a tablet or phone, it means it is essentially useless to answer that question on every transit rider's mind: Did I miss the bus? You can't just whip out your phone or tablet, open up the link and see the bus coming towards you on your route. It requires a level interacting and precise tapping that is very difficult (if not impossible) to do while walking swiftly towards your stop.  This webpage is only useful if you're at home or work with your desktop computer, 10 minutes (or more) way from walking out the door, when you can afford the time to open it up your bowser and do the following:   chose the route zoom, scroll, zoom, scroll, zoom, scroll... in to your location close enough to separate the stops and select yours check the first of the next three bus arrival times unzoom, scroll... back out a bit to find the nearest buses wait two or three refreshes to figure out which one is coming towards your stop in the right direction zoom, scroll... back in on that bus select the second or third stop ahead of it and note the next arrival on the popup close the popup select the bus and note it's ETA at the stop you previously selected do the mental arithmetic to determine if it is ahead or behind and by how much apply that result to the arrival time at your stop   Rather cumbersome, isn't it?  Checking much further ahead of time than 10 minutes or so and there's too much risk that the bus will make up the time it was behind. Now you're leaving you home or office to arrive at the stop 2 minutes late for a bus that used to 3 minutes late for a 1 minute wait, but now it's on time and you see it drive past and you've missed it. Or, if you can't see it immediately, you get there not knowing it's already gone past and you have to wait another 15 or 30 minutes.  Conversely, if the bus is ahead, it will probably lose that time as it pauses at one of the official timepoints to be exactly on time and you'll end up waiting a few minutes longer. While that's not so bad, you didn't really gain anything compared to just noting the next bus time from stock Google Maps and planning to arrive there 4 or 5 minutes ahead the bus.  Where this real-time info would be usable is if you had an unforeseen delay in leaving to walk to the stop and you get there right at the time the bus was supposed to go past or a minute or two later. Pop open the link on your phone's browser as you're walking to the door, it opens up full screen, immediately zooms in to where you are, but not too close, it shows a bus headed in your direction, you tap it and it shows the ETA. You can make it, but barely, only if you run. So you decide to go the café instead and wait for the next one. Or you're already at the stop a minute late, and instead of going to the café and missing this bus, just wait because it's three minutes behind.  But as I detailed above, you can't really do that because the the UI isn't suitable for a mobile experience."

I don't think it is that simple. AFAIK, Google Maps doesn't do any real-time updating of any public transit system. They only take the static GTFS-formatted data put out by many transit agencies to place stops and show their next scheduled times. That data is already supplied by the Region to Google, which is why you can transit route plan between two points.

waterloo,2kktux,nowakattack,2,Tue Oct 28 22:22:45 2014 UTC,"I disagree with the claim that most people don't think about lrt. With the amount of times it is featured in the local news and the fact that the newly elected politicians all have views that correlate with pro lrt sentiments (which cannot just be a large coincidence), I'm sure that anyone you ask in Waterloo region already has their own opinion on lrt. So people do think about it."

Some people have an opinion on the LRT, but most people are not preoccupied with local politics let alone political issues. This recent election has been cited has having the worst turn out of any preceeding election. This is something that has to change almost the world over. The fact remains though; politics hinging on social issues such as LRT are all but missing the point of a disinterested public. Newly appointed mayor Berry Vrbanovic hopes to change all that."

Aissa paid for somebody to do design on stoplightrail.ca and add content to it, tried to sue the Region and then ran for mayor. And he still lost.  Essentially, the anti-LRT side is now the equivalent of a lame duck president, as they say in the USA, and it will take a serious fuck up in getting it ready or drastically over-estimated initial and growing ridership rates for them to ever gain traction in the future."

But Aissa and MacDonald both lost by a wide margin.  I don't know which other candidates were anti-LRT.  Edit: Ironically, I think that Aissa gave Seiling a larger majority than he would have had if Aissa wasn't running.  By making the LRT such a big issue, I think it became an LRT (Seiling) vs. anti-LRT (Aissa) election.  Without Aissa and the LRT issue, I think many people (myself included) would have taken a closer look at the other candidates."

waterloo,2ka9l2,gordondeck,3,Sat Oct 25 15:02:15 2014 UTC,"As someone who used to sell tickets for rangers games for 3 years I can say with confidence that it will be more expensive than this. Last I checked it was $2k alone to rent a box (not a booth) then you have to buy tickets on top of it (I think you get 4 included). Also, it's not all you can eat or drink. You pay for everything you take out of your fridge and everything you order from your personal server. The only things that's all you can eat? The popcorn.   While it's awesome and a great time it ends up being very expensive. Also, you have to book these in advance as their are only 2 boxes available for public rental.   OP I always go down to Niagara with my buddies for bachelor parties. It's got a little something for everyone. Can get rooms pretty cheap, plan a nice dinner (look up casablanca or brassa), get some gamble on, hit the club's our titty bar, go to Dave and busters, etc. There's a ton of things to do and it's nice because they are all walkable from your hotel and people can always find something they like."

You can only create so many express bus routes, the solution to big city commuting isn't in motor vehicles, it's in rail infrastructure."

In both cases they are paying for infrastructure that they won't get much out of, in their minds. They get groceries at 10:30 am on Tuesday so they don't mind the rush hour traffic jams that will worsen as population increases. They don't consider that the cashier at that store had to get there for 8am, or that their Independent Living Centre caregiver needs a viable method of transportation for somebody who earns less than a livable wage.  They are also used to getting their way - they are usually the largest voting bloc. KW has different demographics than average Canada though, so we are able to invest in the future.

waterloo,2k7xvp,Ostabby,-3,Sun Oct 26 00:15:49 2014 UTC,"Let's face it the LRT was designed to be purchased before any election could stop it.

waterloo,2k7xvp,mpd618,6,Sat Oct 25 03:10:01 2014 UTC,"Let me see, the last elect was... oh yes, 2010. At that point we didn't even have the final route proposals yet, much less what we would have wanted companies to bid on. They were delivered in 2011: 9 LRT proposals and 1 BRT proposal. IIRC it was February or March. And all we had was estimates as to the cost (which turned out to be too high, BTW). So, duh, of freaking course it was too soon!  And just because the vote for accepting the bid from GrandLinq came this spring, before the election does not mean it was ""designed to be purchased before any election could stop it"".

I'm not strongly for or against the LRT but it's adorable that I was downvoted for what was intended to be a joke comment, because regardless of what happens at this point, a tremendous amount of money will be spent."
waterloo,2k7xvp,isUsername,5,Fri Oct 24 20:43:23 2014 UTC,"Given that GRT ridership as a whole is a few years ahead of projections (already reach the 2016 goals) and iXpress 200 ridership has grown at twice the overall rate (13% vs 6.5%) and both have 10000 riders per day between Fairview Park Mall and Conestoga Mall.  This means that at current rates, iXpress 200 will have 16300 riders per day and route 7 15600 for a combined total of 31 600 people. Since the 200 will disappear and it's reasonable to assume that significant fraction of the riders on the 7 will shift to the LRT, it's a darn good bet that the expected 25 000 riders per day will be there in 2017.  So why do you think it's won't see the necessary volume? And what bus service do you think the money should have been spent on?"

waterloo,2k80mi,CrazedLumberjack,2,Sun Oct 26 00:41:36 2014 UTC,"If it were just widening of the existing corridor, it probably wouldn't have taken so long to get the project going. It's a new corridor that connects to the Conestoga Expressway at Wellington Street."
waterloo,2k80mi,mpd618,2,Sat Oct 25 00:06:31 2014 UTC,A lot of the traffic between Guelph and KW area could easily be reduced by implementing integrated transit system.  Guelph Transit needs to integrate with Grand River Transit.  This would significantly reduce the number of cars on the road.
waterloo,2k80mi,newgame99,1 point,Fri Oct 31 03:33:08 2014 UTC,"I would totally agree with that. The only way for me to get to Guelph (I do not drive) is a 3 hour GO trip via Aberfoyle for $8, or a 45 minute Greyhound trip for $25."

Sure you can try greyhound but its expensive and runs only few hours a day.

waterloo,2k7v25,ehlow,3,Fri Oct 24 18:24:35 2014 UTC,"This article is quite old. Some steps were taken already and many promises were made during the last provincial election. Google ""GO Regional Rail"" and some of the projects Metrolinx is doing. More info likely will be revealed in December. They even promised high speed rail in 10 years (45 min between Toronto & Waterloo).  Some increased service is happening in 2016 but it's still for KW->Toronto commuters (to Toronto in the morning, to KW in the afternoon).  Having said that true all day two way service and other improvements are unfortunately likely years away.  If you're living in Toronto I personally don't think the commute is worth it. I'm also a tech guy living in Toronto (I've also lived in KW). Take a look at the tech companies in Toronto.  And I do think living in Toronto is worth it, if you like an urban environment, big vibrant city with sports games, concerts or whatever you're into, being on the shore of Lake Ontario, endless interesting neighbourhoods & restaurants."
waterloo,2k7v25,ehlow,1 point,Sat Oct 25 04:47:07 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the reply; I've googled the Go Regional Rail and saw their scheduled projects. But it seems like the KW<->Toronto commute is not put in priority at all, most of the funds are diverted to the LRT projects; so as what you've said is true that they are indeed not going affect my life in near future.  I actually did look at the tech companies from Toronto. And I am also holding a job offer from one of the very good IT companies from Toronto. However, I've also have the job offer from a top-brand software company based in Waterloo (you know what it is). That attracts me a lot as a technical guy and I have no choices but to decide between a vibrant urban life and a fancy job. The third choice to have both of them is to live in Toronto and work in Waterloo and thereby sacrifice some time on the commute everyday."
waterloo,2k7v25,BigBonzo,2,Sat Oct 25 18:17:09 2014 UTC,"If it's Google, then they run a bus between Toronto (probably downtown core) and Kitchener, I heard.. Google should just allow SW devs to work in their Toronto office, in my opinion (as an outsider). It would still be spending a lot of time on the bus, but it's probably better than driving.  Anyways, congrats on your offers. There are definitely things I liked about living in KW (no traffic, cheap housing), but personally I just prefer a bigger city.  I dream of a day when there's one train in each direction between Kitchener & Toronto at least every hour and we can avoid the terribly gridlocked 401 in comfort. It's very possible it could happen in a few years.  But even with high speed rail at 45 min travel time in 10 years, it's still a long commute. There are companies I'd probably be interested in at KW that I won't apply for because I don't want to move back there."

The same basic app compiled for Gingerbread would still run on Kitkat. It won't have all the fancy UI/UX bells and whistles, but it will run.  In any case, focusing on just the most recent major update makes that ease of development issue a non-issue. 25% of Android users are on KitKat and that makes 17% of the smartphone market1 right there. iOS8, on the other hand, hand is only on 52% of iOS devices for 10%2 of the market. Back that down to JellyBean and iOS7 (the versions of each that will do nearly everything of the current version) and you have 54% and 19%.

waterloo,2jxqs4,readysteadywhoa,5,Wed Oct 22 11:57:53 2014 UTC,What are the plans to get increased ridership? Genuinely curious.  Seems to me like the only people that would really use LRT are the people who already currently take the bus.
waterloo,2jxqs4,mpd618,5,Wed Oct 22 17:41:57 2014 UTC,"According to a study last year, ridership in the region is already three years ahead of where they estimated by the time the first phase is operating (2017).  Ion is replacing the existing ~19 corridor buses (mostly iXpress) that currently operate every 10-15 minutes. The LRT is expected to further reduce that to ~7.5 minutes.  In the grand scheme of things, the LRT is meant to encourage concentrated population density along the corridor, instead of sprawling ever outward as the region is doing now."
waterloo,2jxqs4,manitoba98,2,Wed Oct 22 17:57:51 2014 UTC,"IIRC, after ION is here, not only will the iXpress 200 disappear (so the buses can be used elsewhere), I think 7 Mainline will also be reduced from it's current frequency of between 4.5 and 7.5 minutes down to 15 minutes. However, that's all been just educated speculation from the GRT transit planners I've heard talk about it and not any official word."
waterloo,2jxqs4,Serifus,3,Wed Oct 22 20:53:42 2014 UTC,"1) Restructure the bus network to be more of a grid pattern, with the LRT as the spine. (Currently, there is a hub-and-spoke model that relies on terminals for connections.)  2) Provide a better experience through a modern, quiet, electric light rail service that provides a smoother and faster ride than the current iXpress, while serving more stops.  3) Guide new development to locate along the LRT route so that new jobs and residents result in transit ridership (on the LRT) rather than in more cars."

waterloo,2jxqs4,scottyb83,1 point,Wed Oct 22 21:31:13 2014 UTC,What I have a hard time visualizing is how cars are going to share the road with those beasts. The train cars seem absolutely massive and King St. is for the most part only single lane. How are we suppose to pass them?
waterloo,2jxqs4,Ken_Breadbox,11,Wed Oct 22 05:14:17 2014 UTC,You don't. If I remember correctly these are more like St Clair or Spadina Streetcars on their own right-of-way.
waterloo,2jxqs4,scottyb83,6,Wed Oct 22 07:29:44 2014 UTC,Correct. Waterloo Region's LRT plans never have the trains sharing a right-of-way with vehicles (except at intersections).
waterloo,2jxqs4,Ken_Breadbox,6,Wed Oct 22 11:49:18 2014 UTC,"No section of King St. is only a single lane. There is two-way traffic all along it's length and is mostly a four-lane road, except from Francis St. to Stirling Ave., where it is two lanes, an then from Stirling to Ottawa St. where it is three lanes.  In any case, the LRT does not run on the two-lane sections of King St. If you zoom in, you can see this.  The southbound track leaves King St. at Victoria St. and never returns to King St. The northbound track does not hit King St. until Francis, which is the north end of the two-lane stretch.  Also, even though King St. is four lanes in Uptown Waterloo, the southbound track goes down Caroline St. S., after leaving the railway right of way, until Allen St. W., so only the northbound track goes right through Uptown.  The only other point where the LRT is on King St. is from Conestoga Mall to Northfield Dr., and that section is also four lanes."

waterloo,2jxqs4,scottyb83,1 point,Wed Oct 22 20:18:18 2014 UTC,I agree but eventually it might get to the point where you need one. better to plan early and have it imo.
waterloo,2jxqs4,mpd618,1 point,Wed Oct 22 20:26:12 2014 UTC,"How long do you think it will take before the population of this place is big enough to run a subway that isn't a money sink? The smallest city on the planet with a subway has 250,000 people. Which city were you thinking of putting it in--Kitchener (219,000); Waterloo (98,000) or Cambridge (126,000)? Surely  you weren't thinking of all three of them. Subways cost an average of $250 million per km underground and $100 million per km  above ground. A 36 km route (the ION's length) would thus cost between $3.6 billion and $9 billion. Where does that money come from?"
waterloo,2jxqs4,mpd618,1 point,Wed Oct 22 20:39:48 2014 UTC,"Yes you are quoting current populations but like I mentioned you should be looking at further growth. In your own numbers you mentioned the smallest population with a subway is 250,000 and Kitchener alone is 219,000 and Waterloo is 98,000 totalling 317,000  that doesn't include the influx of students that both Kitchener and Waterloo get every year. As a city grows it requires more and more transit. It may not be needed now but what about in 10 years? 20? It's better to do it early and not find yourself where Toronto is (my city) with constant transit issues."
waterloo,2jxqs4,trenchdick,1 point,Wed Oct 22 21:14:56 2014 UTC,"Toronto as a city has twenty times our population--even more than that if you consider the number of commuters that use that subway system. I don't disagree with you that given future growth we need to plan ahead. That's exactly what we're doing with ION. A subway, in my opinion, is sheer overkill. Again--money. That's a hell of a lot of money to saddle us with in taxes, for something that will not be used to anything like its capacity for decades."
waterloo,2jxqs4,mpd618,1 point,Wed Oct 22 21:27:09 2014 UTC,"It might be overkill, this ION plan might be perfect but it might not be enough. I'm not comparing KW and Toronto directly. They have very different layouts, populations, and needs for transit like you mentioned. I brought up Toronto because for as long as I can remember there has been a transit issue. It is the debate of every political season and it never seems to get solved. If it had been set up properly in the 1st place there would be a lot fewer issues.  I also said this is my opinion. I am no expert in finances or city planning. I'm just going off of person experiences."
waterloo,2jxqs4,isUsername,1 point,Wed Oct 22 21:58:13 2014 UTC,"The problem in T.O. is that it has become politicized too much. Each mayoral candidate, for instance, has his or her own transit plan. They get battled over, either accepted or rejected, after which point the building either begins or gets scrapped and still paid for. That's lunacy. There should be one independent transit authority in Toronto that is not beholden to polls. It should come up with one, as-ideal-as-possible transit plan. And then mayors should be debating how best to fund it."
waterloo,2jxqs4,Sector_Corrupt,1 point,Wed Oct 22 22:39:09 2014 UTC,"Totally agree and it drives me crazy. I live close to the Eglinton cross town LRT they are building but every other month it seems there is a new plan, especially this time of year during elections.   One of the biggest issues is that Toronto is crowded. there isn't much room to build really and the building that is getting done is more expensive and causes a LOT of traffic issues. If KW plans ahead and gets transit in place early, before there is crowding and traffic issues then they can avoid at least part of Toronto's issues."
waterloo,2jxqs4,s6xspeed,8,Wed Oct 22 23:06:10 2014 UTC,The Region is spending $300+m on some upgrades to its wastewater treatment plant. It's spending $50+m just to build the Weber Street underpass and widen it to 4 lanes on a very small stretch.  The province is spending $100m to widen just a portion of the Conestoga Expressway. The cost to build a new Conestoga Expressway would be in the billions.  Infrastructure is expensive.
waterloo,2jxqs4,shepd,3,Wed Oct 22 04:13:29 2014 UTC,"Actually, the Weber St. widening is almost the same cost as the LRT after you factor in having to purchase the land in order to tear down those 34 homes and 4 business properties. The $50M is only what we're paying Steed & Evans."
waterloo,2jxqs4,shepd,1 point,Wed Oct 22 12:12:37 2014 UTC,"I don't think quite that much money was spent on acquiring property for Weber - it was probably, what, a few tens of millions? And you're looking at the local share of LRT costs, but my point is about the total capital costs."

waterloo,2jxqs4,s6xspeed,6,Wed Oct 22 12:08:25 2014 UTC,"The buses along the corridor the LRT is being built are often over-crowded at peak times. In addition to traffic congestion causing schedule reliability issues along main routes, the overcrowding leads to bus-bunching which exacerbates the schedule issues.  In other words, the LRT is needed now and something that is needed is not a waste of money.  Since you don't know the population, Do you even live in Waterloo Region to be able to make an ignorant comment like this?"
waterloo,2jxqs4,s6xspeed,1 point,Wed Oct 22 13:12:46 2014 UTC,"If the LRT is as necessary as you say to relieve stress on the GRT routes, then why is there no plan to refund tax monies taken through LRT fares in the future?  It would seem like the right thing to do, since anything in such demand would typically be extraordinarily profitable."
waterloo,2jxqs4,mpd618,1 point,Wed Oct 22 16:22:29 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure I follow you. Are you saying that after we've finished paying for the debt from the Region's share of LRT 20 years from now, we should start using LRT fares to give people rebates on their property taxes until they've receive an amount equal to their LRT-related increase?  That would not be possible, assuming that LRT is funded the same way GRT is now. Only about half of the GRT's budget comes from fares, the other half comes from Regional subsidy, so it's reasonable to assume the same thing would happen for ION. To make the GRT merely break even without subsidy, all prices would have to double. The cash fare would be $6 instead of $3, the adult pass would be $152 instead of $76, and price   Yes, there's obviously demand for service there, but this is not a profit-making enterprise. Perhaps you have some wrong assumptions how things like this operate?"

waterloo,2jwgdb,Serifus,3,Tue Oct 21 21:54:22 2014 UTC,"Break the contract with GrandLinq, pay the penalties and almost certainly deal with civil suits for doing that. To break the contract, they'd have to get a majority of councillors to agree with them to do so, as I do not think the regional chair can do it by themselves. Even if Jay Aissa were to replace Ken Seiling, I think he'd have an extremely hard road ahead to get the LRT cancelled.  Ottawa cancelled their LRT project in 2006 before breaking ground on anything and they ended up paying $36M in penalties and suits. It's been suggested that the region would have up to $100M in penalties and suits after the dust settled."

The Provincial and Federal governments would lmaost certainly reallocate those funds since they were promised specifically for the LRT, not just general public transit funding.  But hey, pretend that money would stay. Making GRT free is not a solution to the current scheduling issues that traffic and overcrowding cause. At best it does nothing and at worse it would only increase the overcrowding.  TriTAG has a great post on this."

waterloo,2jykcj,CoryCA,1 point,Thu Oct 23 01:48:20 2014 UTC,"They advertise HD as well but only play 780p   I think you mean 720p which technically is HDTV. In fact, most TV stations and cable channels broadcast at 720p and only a few at 1080i. Last I checked, nobody broadcasted yet at 1080p even though many web downloads after first broadcast are 1080p resolution.  Also, using wifi for video streaming is never very reliable, especially if you have any walls or floors between the device and the access point. The wifi on your laptop may say you have a 65Mbps 802.11n connection but the next room over you'll only be able to get 26Mbps sustained because of all the errored packets and retries. That's quite common with WiFi.  Since you need 3-5Mpbs for 720p or 5-8Mbps for 1080p (compressed, both), and streaming does not retransmit packets, I'm sure you can see how an error rate that high to halve your effective bandwidth would make it difficult to actually get a working HD stream.  Even if you do have decent WiFi connect that performs optimally for it's negotiated rate, WiFi is not full duplex. The access point can only send one packet at a time so whatever bandwidth it is at gets divided up be all connected & active devices. That connection that may be 65Mbps and clean so that it actually can transmit that fast, but with 4 devices you're down to 16Mbps.  Chances are that problems affecting the streaming before getting a repeater were a combination of those two reasons, more likely than the VDSL connection's fault. (Assuming that you had used speedtest.net to rule that out.)"

waterloo,2jykcj,CoryCA,1 point,Thu Oct 23 20:30:25 2014 UTC,"I am a VMedia customer and I am very disappointed in the crappy service. Their customer service reps are only that - they have little (if any) technical skills to actually fix problems and, in many cases, to even understand what the problem is to be able to explain it to the techs who can actually do the fixing. And no matter how strongly you ask, they will never, ever escalate you to a tech or a supervisor, even when your issue has been dragging on for days and is not yet fixed.  As add on services I have a static IP address for my VDSL connection and an additional block of IP addresses routed to to me for servers that I want directly on the internet instead of port forwarding. One afternoon, that block suddenly stopped being routed to me, so I webchatted their tech support, the guy told me he'll check. While I was waiting my VDSL disconnected and reconnected and he came back told me ""we rest your account"" and that additional block of IP addresses was once again being routed to.  But later after random connection recycle, I noticed that my main IP address was no longer static and it was changing at every reconnect.  So I contacted VMedia again and told them. At first, they thought I was talking about the block of addresses, not the main one, and their response was that I was responsible for configuring my own router.  So I called back and explained to the person that I was talking about the main IP address, the one that everybody has even if they don't have an additional block, and how that main IP address is given to my router by their server during PPP connection set-up and it's not something I can fix/select/chose by configuring my router. ""Static IP"" just means they give me the same one every time instead a random one like most residential accounts get.  The response I got back was, again, about how it was up to me to configure the additional block on my router correctly.  Lather, rinse, repeat. For five days until somebody finally understood what was happening and fixed my account so their server was once again giving me the same IP address all the time instead of a random one.  Repeated requests to be escalated to speak directly to a tech who would actually understand what I was talking about were denied. ""They don't answer the phones"" was the reason given, ""It's not their job"". On the final call, when I was extremely frustrated and asked to be escalated to a supervisor, that was refused as well. First it was the rep was literally incapable of transferring me to the supervisor because they phone system couldn't do that, then it was supervisor had already gone home. Then it was they were on a call, then it was they were too busy doing other work off the phone, then it was they had other people who had been promised call backs before me.  Eventually I was told that somebody would call me back, but they refused to give me a time frame. It so happened that they called me the next afternoon while I was out getting groceries but they only called my landline even though they also have my mobile number. When I called back to say I had been left a message, they once again refused to transfer me through or to let me wait on hold. All the would say is that I would be called back.  That never happened."

waterloo,2jsld3,cldellow,-1,Mon Oct 20 17:19:04 2014 UTC,"I will not comment on the LRT, but your analysis ignores a basic economic principle of sunk costs. All money that has been spent or otherwise committed to the project is a sunk cost, and is thus not relevant to the decision of whether to continue or not. All prospective costs can, in fact, be ""saved"" and used for other purposes. This is your real opportunity cost - the rest is history and is relevant to political finger-pointing purposes only."
waterloo,2jsld3,mpd618,11,Mon Oct 20 18:22:23 2014 UTC,"The point being made here is that the $250 million is a sunk cost. So the question becomes, do you want to spend $250 million and have light rail, or do you want to spend $250 million and have nothing?"
waterloo,2jsld3,Nextasy,-4,Mon Oct 20 18:46:09 2014 UTC,"The question should really be, do you want to spend $3 million (or whatever the prospective cost is) to have light rail or not? The $250 million is a red herring."

waterloo,2jsld3,iigor,-3,Mon Oct 20 19:40:38 2014 UTC,"You're right - there is a cost of legal settlements. It's not clear though how to quantify this cost, or what the cost of finishing the project would be."
waterloo,2jsld3,scshunt,3,Mon Oct 20 19:44:58 2014 UTC,"or what the cost of finishing the project would be.   Umm, I think we know pretty well what the cost of finishing the project is. It's ~$818M, with $253M the region's share."
waterloo,2jsld3,iigor,0,Mon Oct 20 19:50:08 2014 UTC,"How do you account for cost overruns if they occur?  I'm not very well informed on the matter, but I assume part of the concern raised by anti LRT people is that the region is 100% on the hook for cost overruns (i.e. that sweet provincial/federal funding is limited - if we fuck up the execution of the project, we're on the hook for it)."
waterloo,2jsld3,iigor,6,Mon Oct 20 20:30:30 2014 UTC,"That's what the DBFOM contract model provides for. My understanding is that if there are overruns, GrandLinq will be responsible for them, not the Region.  Also, cost overruns typically happen in a project because of scope-creep where changes (additions) are made to a project after it has been green-lighted. In a case like this, there's not going to be any changes made unless there is some very serious contingencies that come out of nowhere requiring major changes to the planned route."
waterloo,2jsld3,thoughtsy,3,Mon Oct 20 20:50:08 2014 UTC,"It is a fixed price construction contract, and GrandLinq is responsible for cost overruns. They need to deliver a system that meets specific performance requirements both on delivery and over the project lifespan or they don't get paid.  You can see more reasoning behind the Region's procurement model here. But it's a public-private partnership in part to get the Region a predictable fixed price contract."
waterloo,2jsld3,thoughtsy,2,Tue Oct 21 01:15:19 2014 UTC,More like would you rather spend 3 million to get a 250 million dollar lrt or not spend it and get nothing
waterloo,2jsld3,thoughtsy,2,Mon Oct 20 20:52:57 2014 UTC,"Well, you won't be able to re-sell the LRT for 250 million, so it becomes a question of value. Is the value of LRT greater than 3 million? Most people would probably say so. So, my suggestion is that the question should be framed that way, instead of in terms of the 250 million already spent (which is irrelevant)."
waterloo,2jsld3,thoughtsy,2,Mon Oct 20 21:03:25 2014 UTC,"It may be a sunk cost, but it is still a cost, and cost that would end up having been spent on nothing and it still needs to be counted in the cost of cancellation. Just because it has already happened doesn't mean that one can wave ones hands and magically say there was no cost to cancellation.  Your point would be good if it were at an earlier point in time, but like the article said, by the time cancellation could happen, $250M out of $253 will have already been spent - it's not like only a few million have been spent and the waste of funds would be trivial. Especially since, as the article points out, the ""prospective"" ( in your terms) cost of cancellation is likely to be ten ore more times the ""prospective"" cost of continuing on."
waterloo,2jsld3,thoughtsy,-1,Mon Oct 20 19:02:27 2014 UTC,"The cost to cancellation would be the legal settlements. So, yes, there is a cost to cancellation, but there is also a cost to not cancel. The money that has already been spent is irrelevant."
waterloo,2jsld3,thoughtsy,1 point,Mon Oct 20 19:40:36 2014 UTC,"This is the correct phrasing of the question, assuming that no governmental funding has been received yet."
waterloo,2jsld3,thoughtsy,1 point,Mon Oct 20 19:48:08 2014 UTC,"I am trying to pose the question correctly; I did not speak as to what the choice should be. As CoryCA pointed out above, the cost to keep going is ~818M. If we say the cost to cancel is 72M (double that of Ottawa), we can save ~746M as a province by not going forward with this. Again, I am not saying we should cancel; just trying to pose the economic question without bias or fallacy, as you put it.  Edit: ~818M included sunk costs, so that's incorrect. The cost to keep going is 818-250 already spent=568M.  Also, there is other costs to both sides. The cost of not having the transit, the environmental cost of having the project, the maintenance costs, etc, etc. Maybe people care about ""savings"" to some of these other costs?"
waterloo,2jsld3,thoughtsy,2,Tue Oct 21 01:24:13 2014 UTC,"Okay, I see what you are saying. Let's keep it at the regional level. Then my questions become: -Did the region pay the full amount of the 250M bill for completed work? It's hard to believe that we only have 3M left to pay. -Would the region be fully responsible for the legal cancellation fees? -Will the province possibly allow the funds to be moved to a different project? Or is it LRT or nothing?"

Off hand, the only park the LRT will cut through is Waterloo Park.

Though I'm not sure how, never having had problems crossing those tracks across the Iron Horse Trail near Victoria Park while biking there. snort   how rapidly trains will be obsolete   They're supposed to last 30 years. Why do you think they will soon go obsolete?   the sound   What sound? They're electric and will be less noisy than buses or cars. Or were you imagining some huge diesel train engine blowing it's horn as it comes up to a road and the clanging bells of a railway crossing?   Please don't let it get built   Why not? Buses will simply not be viable as the roads become more and more clogged, which kinda rules out a BRT system like Jay Aissa wants.  To widen that final stretch of Weber St. to 4 lanes for about 1km, it is costing as much as the 14-15km of the LRT. Now multiply that by all the fricking roads in the region.

waterloo,2j6hmg,jschwe,5,Tue Oct 14 18:31:40 2014 UTC,"I learned first hand that a free cat isn't a free cat. We have two--the first was adopted from the humane society, fixed, with all her shots, for $200 and I have hardly had to spend anything else on her, besides food.   The other was free, from someone with an accidental litter. It was close to $600 by the time we had all his shots and he was fixed. Then, he broke his arm. That was another $1600 when all was said and done. Then, he ate something he shouldn't have. That was $400. Then, he had a blocked bladder and almost died. That was $600, and we got off easy. Plus they wanted to switch us to a fancy vet diet.   Granted, most of that could have happened regardless of what we spent when we first got him. I just wanted to illustrate how important it is to remember that if you are adopting a pet, you WILL end up spending money on it. Probably more than you ever thought you would let yourself spend on an animal. Don't ever assume they will be free...."

Petfinder.com is where you can find rescues that have dogs available for adoption. The fee is usually $200-500 depending on the rescue, but that will include all the shots relevant to the dog's age, as well as spay/neuter. The adoption fee is really just covering the vet costs and not much more."
waterloo,2j6hmg,heavenlybubbles,4,Tue Oct 14 14:07:16 2014 UTC,"Free? There's no such thing as a ""free"" animal. These bitches be expensive. If cost is a concern, please reconsider."
waterloo,2j6hmg,Rakaith,2,Wed Oct 15 01:08:56 2014 UTC,"We have two dogs and one cat, all rescues.   My dalmatian was dropped off at the SPCA because he had some mild health issues that required medication and monthly vet visits. The guy's friend bought the dog as a puppy and asked a friend of his to ""watch it for a few days"". Well the guy never came back. Since the new owner was single, he just could not afford to care for him anymore.   Our Sheppard was one of two dogs that were dropped off at the shelter. It seems the owners had a new baby and the dogs were acting dangerously around it. It was obvious soon after we adopted him that he was never properly socialized and 8 years later he still has his moments, but it a total sweetheart.   If you are going to adopt a pet, be prepared to take some time off work (at least a week) to give you and the dog a chance to get to know each other and let them get familiar with the new environment.  The biggest mistake you can make it choosing a pet based on it's breed. The SPCA will ask you about your lifestyle and work with you to find a pet that matches."

My vet in Cambridge adopts out pets that breeders can't fix (minor problem in puppy, they surrender the puppy to the vet. Vet fixes problem and adpots out the dog). http://www.animalhospitalofcambridge.com/  I cannot say enough about how wonderful this vet clinic has been. We have six cats, and two dogs.

If you really think Rogers is shit, take a look at Bell plans and multiple your internet connection issue by about three.

When we first started with Rogers, the internet did seem to fade every now and then, however my internet hasn't had any issues since I can remember and I use my internet a lot. Maybe it has something to do with the part of town you are in that you are in?  Now when I say I am kinda happy with them, the speeds are not as fast as I wish they were, but it's the best thing when I compared around with other ISPs. We also managed to score a deal with them back when they had a promotion going on and paid $10 extra on our existing plan for unlimited data.  TL;DR: Rogers is better than Bell and any other ISP (that I've seen). I thought I got throttled in the beginning of the plan, but not anymore. Could be your location?"

waterloo,2iz0sw,LongoSpeaksTruth,9,Sat Oct 11 20:53:58 2014 UTC,"Not so fast there cowboy. I agree that a ""sit down"" sushi restaurant will be tastier than an AYCE establishment.   However this is true of any type of restaurant. IE; Montana's has a pretty decent steak, but no, it is not in the same league as say Golf's Steak House. However, the Montana's steak is not nearly as expensive as Golf's steak.  That is true for the Sushi restaurants in K-W as well. On average AYCE sushi restaurants are about $18.99 per person for dinner (plus tax & tip obviously). It would be no problem for 2 people to go to a higher end sushi restaurant and easily drop $150 and above, plus tax and tip.  I personally like the original AYCE sushi restaurant in the K-W area: Ye's on King St. in downtown Kitchener. Nara Sushi (685 Fischer-Hallman Rd) is also tasty.  O'Yummy Sushi at the roundabout at Ira Needles & Erb St puts out some good AYCE sushi as well.  I have not been,but have heard really good things about Itamae Sushi (253 King St N. Waterloo)  Hope this helps."

The units are at different stages of renovation so make sure you ask if the one you view is the exact one you'll get. Try to get one facing outward rather than into the courtyard. Prices seemed reasonable. Mostly students, pretty relaxed environment. Little known fact: it has a free racquetball court and indoor basketball court that you can use. PM me with any Q's."
waterloo,2i5xft,assstastic,1 point,Fri Oct 3 17:06:05 2014 UTC,"I lived in one of the (un-renovated) units for 2 years.  The location is fantastic, but I had many issues with the building unrelated to the renovations:   Random stuff is in disarray... hallways, basement, elevators, they look like they're in disrepair. Hot Water would get turned off all the time, whether scheduled or not.  The piping and water heater are super old, and would constantly break. Superintendant made tons of rental mistakes and would overcharge me every over month.  I'd have to go and talk to them in person (not an easy task, and probably impossible if I had not been a student) and sometimes they still wouldn't fix it. I paid for an outdoor parking spot, but they don't do anything to actually give you a spot or reserve it.  In fact, they don't check on parking outside anyways, so it's a straight-up scam and you shouldn't pay for it. One day while I was at home, the pipe above my unit's bathroom blew out, and half my unit was flooded.  They had to cut out my bathroom ceiling because apparently water had been building up from leaks for a while, and there was mold.  It took them months to fix my ceiling, and over a year to fix my floor tiles.  The super constantly gave me the runaround and as I was in the middle of my thesis, I didn't have time to take action with the Tenant board.   From what I hear, the superintendant has changed (though the management company is the same) and is more responsive to emails and more helpful than the previous ones."

Gender stereotyping of kids is EXTREMELY problematic... pink for girls and blue for boys may not seem like a big deal at first pass, but it really is. What do you think happens when little girls learn that their self-worth comes from the boys they date or how they look? Or when little boys learn that they shouldn't play with dolls or be too emotional? How can you not see something wrong with Spanish clothes for little girls that say ""Beautiful like Mommy"" while the one for boys said ""Smart like Daddy"" -- this message is horrifying! ""It's no big deal"" people say, and then in the next breath, they wonder why girls as young as 5 hate their bodies, why some girls have eating disorders, why some plaster their faces with make-up, why some date asshole men who treat them like rubbish, why they post nude pictures of themselves wanting - needing - validation, why they shy away from STEM careers, why they take up jobs that pay lower wages, etc. etc. etc. And what about the little boys? Ever wonder why so many people of our generation “Can’t remember a time they saw their Dad cry” – newsflash: emotions are HUMAN, NOT female... There are real, scary consequences for boys and girls who absorb these messages - explicitly and implicitly. Why do you think clothing - as well as toys - in progressive Scandinavian countries are generally gender neutral (i.e., greens, yellows)? Because the SCIENCE says that YES, GENDER STEREOTYPING CAN HAVE NEGATIVE LIFELONG CONSEQUENCES FOR BOYS AND GIRLS… affecting their careers, their personal relationships and emotional health. Christine Logel is a smart researcher and does VERY good science at UW. These people know what they're talking about… I highly suggest you all do some Googling on this subject before you try to argue that this is “silly” and that these people are too “easily offended”  - there is so much research out there backing this up."

She also said this little girl didn't want to wear shin pads because ""she didn't want her legs to look fat"". How does a 6 year old who can't comprehend the logic behind a soccer game also believe she needs to worry about being fat?  Answer: shit like this.  I agree, there's lots of stuff that I see on the internet and I think ""oh my god, that's a thing now too?"" but we're so used to the messages we send to little boys and girls we don't notice when they are really bad (like this)."

waterloo,2hzma5,redesckey,5,Wed Oct 1 22:50:06 2014 UTC,"Every comment of the type ""people care too much"" or ""slow news day"" or ""Don't like, then don't buy"" are essentially attempts to shut up women who dare to speak up against something that's sexist.  And face it, those onesies are sexist. The boy gets to grow up and be a hero, a worthwhile person. But the girl cannot be worthwhile in her own right - she has to date a guy and get married to him to make her life worthwhile. That is is the message those clothes send.  And don't be saying crap like ""But a boy could wear the pink one, too"", because we all know that boy who does wears pink gets called a ""pansy"", a ""sissy"" or even a ""fag"", indicating even more strongly how being female is that unwanted, unrespected option.  But given the usual demographic of dudebros here on reddit I'm betting most of the commenters haven't even thought this whole issue it through."
waterloo,2hzma5,CoryCA,2,Wed Oct 1 19:35:07 2014 UTC,"Not a ""dudebro"", but as a female I can agree that this is one of the most unimportant news articles I've seen in a long time. No one is silencing anyone. This is a ridiculous thing to be offended by, hence the amount of, gasp, both men AND WOMEN saying such.       Like did you actually just make a fictional narrative about a simple piece of clothing ""she has to date a guy and get married to him to make her life worthwhile"". It doesn't even say anything about getting married.         To be honest, the offense taken by this is hilarious more than anything...  Now stop being sexist in assuming that women too can't have an opposing opinion."
waterloo,2hzma5,ThatAwkwardGinger,2,Wed Oct 1 20:18:48 2014 UTC,"Like did you actually just make a fictional narrative about a simple piece of clothing ""she has to date a guy and get married to him to make her life worthwhile"".

waterloo,2hzma5,nav0n0d,3,Wed Oct 1 20:49:12 2014 UTC,"Totally, no one person can do everything. But perhaps it's up the individual people to determine what they think are the worthy causes to spend their time on?  Conversely, one might ask oneself why there are so many people expending equal effort trying go the the complainers about sexism to shut up?  It's one thing to say ""I think you're mistaken about this being sexist"", because that's just a normal expression of disagreement that isn't trying to shut down the other side. However, comments like ""LOL, get over it!"" or ""Lighten up!"" are meant to make the person pointing out sexism to feel ashamed for doing so. But it's a lot more subtle way of getting them to keep quiet rather than saying ""Shut up, bitch, nobody cares what you think"" which is overtly sexist."

I know we've become a super sensitive, ultra politically correct society, but is this really that outrageously newsworthy???   I've heard about it on the radio, read about it on news websites, and now I guess it is SO terribly outrageous that it needs to be re-posted on Reddit ......  Really ? If this is what people decide is worth a public outcry these days, then we have turned in to a society of mollycoddled sheeple, who must figure that we live in a world that only consists of riding rainbows and chasing unicorns ........   Now go ahead and downvote me, but I don't care. It needed to be said !"
waterloo,2hzma5,LongoSpeaksTruth,9,Wed Oct 1 15:56:41 2014 UTC,"You shouldn't be so pointlessly dismissive of the sort of very subtle, casual sexism this story represents. There is ample, real evidence that shows that this sort of gender stereotyping is harmful to children, because it encourages both the parents and the children alike to internalize the message on display. It influences people to treat boys and girls differently in harmful ways.   We can likely all agree that it would be inappropriate if the boys' clothing literally said ""I am useful and powerful"" and the girls' said ""I am weak and eye candy"". (If you think that would be fine, please exit the conversation immediately, since we'd have a fundamental disagreement about how a healthy society treats its members). Now, the only difference between the photo and my previous statement is that the text in the photo merely implies the message, rather than stating it outright. Maybe you don't think that this is the case, but again, there is real evidence to demonstrate the cumulative effects of being exposed to these sorts of messages over the course of childhood.  Why is being sensitive to the harm we inflict on the most vulnerable members of society a weakness and a failing? Is this generation ""weak"" because we are trying to move beyond the racist and sexist views of previous generations? Just rolling eyes and moving on isn't enough. Equality and progress requires that we talk about these sorts of stories and their implications. It requires spreading information and explaining why this is unacceptable. Maybe spreading this story around will help educate more parents about the harm they can inadvertantly do to their children - it is useful. Social issues aren't tackled by quietly ignoring them and hoping they resolve themselves, or telling the people who are impacted to just ""suck it up and deal with it""."
waterloo,2hzma5,youbrainislying,4,Wed Oct 1 20:26:11 2014 UTC,"Well that was both an unwarranted, childish response, and hypocritical to boot. It's fine if you want to disagree with me but you can do so without trying to bully me out of a conversation. If you can't handle someone flat out saying ""I disagree with you, here are the reasons why"" in a civil manner you should perhaps consider if this whole ""talking to other people"" thing is in your wheelhouse. You certainly aren't putting any effort in to raising the level of discourse above Facebook posts, as you put it.  Plus, launching personal attacks on people for voicing their opinion and immediately following it up with an accusation about how calling out sexist bullshit is some sort of threat to Freedom Of Speech and our national identity, seems rather tone-deaf. In doing so you just appear to be arguing with yourself.   Is anyone here saying these things should be illegal? Is anyone saying that the designer and Target CEO should be arrested and imprisoned? Of course not, that's absurd, but freedom of speech is not the same thing as freedom from consequence or immunity to criticism. Something can be legal without being good for society, and the reverse is also true.  Societal progress depends entirely on convincing people who think everything is just A-OK awesome that maybe their view is a little limited in scope. This means raising issues and discussing them in the open, and voicing dissent. It means making people aware of these problems and talking about why they are harmful. I'm sure we're all terribly sorry if you have ever so briefly had your hackles raised by the whole harrowing ordeal. The nerve of people, exercising their right to free speech."
waterloo,2hzma5,youbrainislying,3,Wed Oct 1 23:32:02 2014 UTC,"All the nonsense you accuse me of speaks far more about the type of person you are and your issues, than me. You seem to be the one who has the chip on the shoulder and the need to prove what a badass you are, but frankly you just come off as ridiculous and sad. Projecting much? Were you bullied? I suspect you were, because you certainly have turned in to one. Most bullies were picked on themselves and act out with rage to cover up their own low self-esteem.   But don't worry, none of us can stop you from being the hero in your own mind that you are. Take your time, hammer out something that will really show everyone here how you don't take shit from nobody. Use lots of ellipses. Perhaps physically threaten me next.   What a joke."

waterloo,2hzma5,m32rober,-1,Wed Oct 1 20:03:15 2014 UTC,"Yes, these pyjamas are ridiculous. Should Target be selling them? No, they're pretty tasteless. Not only is the sexism tasteless, but they're tasteless if you ignore the sexism as well. Does this necessitate outrage? No, not really. Is it offensive? I don't see why it needs to be. You don't have to be offended by bad ideas.  I don't get why this is such a polarising issue. Yes, Target is kind of dumb for selling these. They probably paid hardly any attention to their stock, and they should. And whoever made them wasn't thinking things through when they put messages about dating on toddler pyjamas or decided that girls even need their own version of these pyjamas. I get that this is a symbol of casual sexism in society, but guess what? It's just a couple pieces of clothing. It's the tip of the iceburg, and people are rightfully going to complain that a piece of clothing is probably not as newsworthy as it was made out to be.  When people say that this shouldn't be in the news, they're not dumb. They're not trying to shut women up, either. Either they don't see the problem, are potentially misguided, or don't care about a damn piece of clothing. Let's talk about the underlying issues, not a pair of pyjamas.  Yes, it's important to make people question the subtle sexism implied by these pyjamas. But you do that by giving them information, not by blaming them, telling them they're sexist and part of the problem, telling them they're trying to shut people up, etc.  These pyjamas are an example. They are not themselves the problem. It's not really about the pyjamas. I think it's important for people to understand that when they complain about these pyjamas being in the news, but I think it's also people's responsibility to make it clear what this is really about rather than being offended by the pyjamas and labelling the pyjamas as the problem."

Those cars are not designed for long-haul travel.   For those who don't know, VIA is actually only $15 a ride to Union, if you buy a pack of 20 tickets (usable within 30 days). WAY better for commuting than GO. Too bad that when GO arrived in Kitchener they cancelled the train that arrives in TO before 9am."

For me it's usually nodding in and out of sleep. :-)  What really needs to happen is for the livery laws to change. Robert Q can drive through Kitchener to go to Toronto but can't stop in Kitchener to pick up/drop off anyone? That's ridiculous.  It's a shame that YKF is priced almost exactly $200 more than Toronto for similar destinations. I've flown from there through Chicago a few times and was happy for the convenience, but I can't seem to get anywhere I want in Canada from Kitchener for a reasonable price.  And VIA?

Produce isn't too bad, meat is great. They JUST started taking PC points, and their regular prices are better than a lot of sale prices, for some goods.  Food Basic's - specifically the one on Fairway Road, has good sales & pricing.  Dutchie's: Great prices - produce can be hit and miss for freshness, imo. but their meat prices are fair  Central Meat Market: great sales and pricing for meat  Price Chopper (Weber Street, Kitchener) has excellent produce and pricing.  And the market - I prefer the downtown Kitchener market. I find the pricing to be better than St. Jacob's, and it's not as crowded, plus I'm less likely to be tempted to buy other items here. Parking can be a challenge, though, so either go early or come up with a game plan.  Edit: TO ADD - almost forgot the Wholesale Club in Waterloo by the Chapters. Start here! Produce is fresh, and there's no membership required.   Your best bet is to scour flyers and then go to the Real Canadian Superstore, in my opinion. Produce is freshest there, they have the most selection, and they price match. Just stay away on weekends - it's a zoo. Actually, Friday evenings after 7 are the best time to go - stock is all fully loaded for the weekend, so you'll have lots of selection. And I'm also pretty sure that every weekend, students get 10% off, if you're a student. They also offer promos from time to time where you get free gift cards, etc. for shopping there."

Every time I go (usually during non-peak hours) I spend longer waiting in line at the checkout than I do shopping because they only have 2 or 3 checkouts open.  Conversely, No Frills on Strasburg is excellent.  It's small but even when I go during peak times they move people through very quickly because they have the good sense to open every checkout.  I also prefer PC products to the Metro and Sobeys store brands."
waterloo,2hw1jb,webu,3,Wed Oct 1 02:22:32 2014 UTC,"Sobey's or Zehrs   These are the expensive stores. They have nicer carts, wider aisles, more staff, and pricier goods. And Zehrs = Loblaws, it's just named differently locally.  Sobey's discount brand is Fresh Co. (formerly Price Chopper) and Zehr's discount brands are Valu-Mart and Food Basics.  I suggest Fresh Co at Bridge & University or Valu-Mart in Frederick Mall. I personally don't like Food Basics for service reasons (shelves are always a mess, cashiers don't care, etc) but I think that place is the absolute cheapest. Also, Fresh Co does price matching with competition flyers (not sure about the others)."

Now, that being said, the article is light on what the balance is today.

I don't agree with Dave MacDonald on everything, but I try to take the middle ground on climate change, which seems to leave me in that void of being disliked by both sides, LOL.  That means that I believe there's lots of good science showing how pollution and such affects the environment, and lots of good science showing how earth has climate cycles.  My personal belief is to reduce climate affecting pollution because what you can control you should do your best with, but that people need to understand that that isn't the entire solution and that, to a degree, it's inevitable whether there's people here or not--we're just buying time.  It just drives me nuts when I see people who seem to think either people have nothing to with it, or people are the only cause, since neither of those is good science.  Dave MacDonald is technically within my scope of opinion, since he's never ruled out one or the other.  As for where on that spectrum he is, I've never heard anything particularly specific out of him.  His daytime job to predict the weather 14 days out never really gave me any reason to trust his opinion on the weather 50 years out--and that wouldn't have changed even if every single 14 day prediction was perfect."
waterloo,2hht0z,shepd,1 point,Wed Oct 1 21:02:11 2014 UTC,"but I try to take the middle ground on climate change, which seems to leave me in that void of being disliked by both sides, LOL   I look at climate change the same I way I look at evolution. While I know a lot more about biology, palaeontology compared to the average person, it's still not my area of expertise. Especially not compared to somebody who took 10-15 years and spent tens of thousands of dollars to get a Ph.D. So I conclude that the experts in field, when they agree on something, they are probably correct and the larger the percentage is the higher that probability becomes. No individual human is a perfectly logical robot free from biases, but the fact that evidence is king in science leads to an institutional muting of those biases which makes that probability a reasonably safe thing to have faith in. If an idea has merit, more and more scientists will be won over by it, and by ""merit"" I mean supporting evidence. Of course, this also means I need to be able not only accept it when that consensus changes but also accept it if that consensus is not something that I like. It is also tempered by the understanding that the more impressive the current evidence support the consensus is, the more incredible any new evidence would have to be to change that consensus. For example, by the time genetic science came along, the fossil, morphological, ecological and other evidences for the theory of evolution were already quite strong and as amazing and powerful as genetics is it only served to fine tune our understanding of evolution rather than change it radically.  As such, I cannot currently find myself able to take the middle ground when it comes to climate science and climate change. The evidence is too voluminous, the consensus of the experts is too strong. It is a bit of a straw man, I feel, to say the ""earth has climate cycles"" and use that to try and ""middle ground"" about anthropogenic climate change, because cycles have been accepted for almost 150 years1 and no climate scientist claims otherwise or is (AFAIK) agitating about another glaciation 15,000 years from now. It also indicates, IMHO, a misunderstanding of the topic, particularly because long-term cycles are not exclusive of short-term, human-caused changes that happen much faster and the different effects they have on ecologies.

Not a lounge at all, not owned by an Ethel, but great tex mex food in a divey atmosphere.  And while it's slightly trendy, I think MPC Public fits on the list because of a) their fried chicken and b) they are very much a mom-and-pop type of place. Guess what MPC stands for ;)"
waterloo,2hhhwv,sdeetee,5,Fri Sep 26 12:49:16 2014 UTC,"Okay, I have to share a story about Ethel's:  Years ago, my husband lived in a rooming house with some other students (he was my boyfriend at the time).   I called to speak with him, and his roommate picked up.  ""Hello!"" I said, ""May I speak with [boyfriend]?""  ""Oh,"" said his roommate, very solemnly. ""I'm sorry, Designut, but [boyfriend] is at another girl's house.""  ""Another girl's house?"" I asked.  ""Yes, Designut. And I'm sorry - he goes there all the time.""  ""Really?!"" I ask, surprised and confused. ""What is this girl's name?""  ""Oh, her name is Ethel. He always tells me he's going to Ethel's.""  :D"
waterloo,2hhhwv,designut,2,Fri Sep 26 19:51:53 2014 UTC,Was that a sick joke or was he legitimately oblivious? I'm curious now.
waterloo,2hhhwv,mr-agdgdgwngo,3,Sat Sep 27 05:33:16 2014 UTC,"He was truly oblivious. I guess my guy would say ""I'm going to Ethel's"" as he was heading out, and as a guy who'd just moved to Waterloo and wasn't a part of the bar scene, he thought Ethel was a girl. Poor guy felt so bad to have to break it to me!"
waterloo,2hhhwv,designut,3,Sat Sep 27 14:13:13 2014 UTC,"Egg Roll King, on Courtland, is amazing. But don't order too often because you'll increase the wait time, and that's not cool!  Dragon Court has AMAZING szechuan.  Ennio's - does this count as a ""mom and pop""? Nona works at the Fairway location. Really good, but not cheap, Italian.  Niko Niko has great, fresh sushi - and it's cheap! Not all you can eat - but delicious!  Tomu Sushi is fantastic - I love their Bento dinners - it's a little more pricey, but worth every penny.  Nostra Cucina is FABULOUS - their sandwiches are out of this world, amazing, and they have pasta specials, as well as ""the Back Door"" for a nice dinner. Oh delicious.  Rustic is a new pizzeria in town - located out past Budd Park. They have FANTASTIC salads, and a 'create your own' option - really, really good. Their pizza's delicious, as well!  Twice the Deal Pizza - it's not a mom and pop shop, and the pizza is only a little better than mediocre, but the price is right for ordering after a night at the bar, big time.  Hope that helps!  Edit to add:  I absolutely CAN'T forget about the Stampede Ranch - seriously awesome food -I've said it before and I'll say it again - this is a MUST for any foodies out there. The prices are perfect and the food is seriously awesome - the chef puts great care into what he does, and you can tell!"

It's very Indian inspired. A different curry bowl every day La Sabletine - Pastries, bread Owl of Minerva - I'm not going to pretend like this is good Korean, because it isn't, but for some reason I really like it. Probably because it's a lot of food I grew up eating that I don't cook for myself. Death Valley's Little Brother - If you just want coffee. Public - Tapas"

There are buildings in Waterloo where all units are condos held by the developer who put up the building and rented out to students. It reduces taxes and eases the sale of those assets in the future. I would guess that is what will happen here. It wouldn't be decided now, though.  You won't get any further updates on this from the City. This approval process (Zoning By-law Amendment) is more or less done now, and the next ones are not public. Eventually the developer will set something up."

waterloo,2h5sdy,morefer,16,Mon Sep 22 20:27:04 2014 UTC,"It's a key deposit. If you returned your keys, he has absolutely no grounds to not refund the key deposit. It's not a mattress deposit, and cannot be used to cover damages. If you did cause damages, there is a separate process your landlord can go through to receive compensation from you for that, but it does not involve withholding your key deposit.

waterloo,2h5sdy,Gazz1016,4,Mon Sep 22 22:12:07 2014 UTC,"yes, this.  Also a hundred dollars when you can replace the keys for three dollars at Home Hardware."
waterloo,2h5sdy,squeegeeboy,1 point,Mon Sep 22 22:54:52 2014 UTC,"I've always thought the amount most landlords charge for key deposits is ridiculous too, and I still do, but it should be noted that this cost includes changing the lock (for security reasons)"
waterloo,2h5sdy,sunshineplur,1 point,Tue Sep 23 02:51:50 2014 UTC,"IMHO, a landlord should rekey the locks anyway, regardless of whether keys are returned.  A tenant could easily keep a copy of the key.    Also, according to the LTB:  Can a landlord ask for a deposit for keys?  Yes, but only if:   the deposit is refundable and, the amount of the deposit is not more than the expected cost of replacing the key(s) if they are not returned to the landlord.   The landlord must give the deposit back when the tenant turns in their key(s) at the end of their tenancy."
waterloo,2h5sdy,superbad,1 point,Tue Sep 23 20:00:30 2014 UTC,"Ah, I guess if the rekeying bit isn't explicitly mentioned in the LTB then either way they're trying to screw someone over. In my original comment, though, I was referring to a hypothetical situation where the tenant had lost their key during the tenancy."
waterloo,2h5sdy,sunshineplur,3,Wed Sep 24 17:07:51 2014 UTC,Contact the landlord and tenant board if he does not return the money.  This is absolutely a breach of regulations.
waterloo,2h5sdy,carbonnanotube,2,Tue Sep 23 04:19:23 2014 UTC,"Second this. My old job dealt with a lot of property managers, and they're generally not a fan of having the Tenant Board getting involved. Simply threatening to report them may be enough, but if it's not, they have a tendency to side with the tenant.  However, as far as I know, renting a single room causes you to be defined as a ""squatter"" and not a ""tenant"", so a lot of the protection laws don't apply to your situation."
waterloo,2h5sdy,Slokunshialgo,4,Thu Sep 25 05:17:49 2014 UTC,"Seems like this is a shitty landlord, trying to milk you guys.   Typically speaking, a landlord cannot require you to agree to a security deposit or anything similar, as it is against the landlord-tenant act.  Ask the landlord for a photo of the ""stain"", if he refuses, you know something is up.  I would look it up and have a bit of a read through, that will be your best resource."
waterloo,2h5sdy,ThunderSteaks,4,Mon Sep 22 20:44:42 2014 UTC,Key deposits are legal but they cannot be more than the cost of replacement (which is usually the lock)
waterloo,2h5sdy,Tree_Boar,1 point,Mon Sep 22 23:23:57 2014 UTC,"You do not need to pay full cost for the mattress even if you had purposely damaged it.  You need to pay the amortized cost of the mattress.  If the mattress is intended by the manufacturer to have a 5 year life span, and it was brand new when you received it, you'd pay perhaps 4/5 the cost.  The manufacturer's warranty would probably be helpful in determining the lifespan of the mattress.  The key deposit seems excessive.  Unless those are REALLY high security keys, the typical cost for replacing a key is under $10.  By law, the key deposit cannot be higher than the replacement cost.  He also must return the key deposit if he has the keys irregardless of if you burned the place down, nevermind if you or another person stained some mattress or not.  Your problem is that since you signed a group lease, you are legally responsible for whatever the other 4 people do, as far as the landlord is concerned.  He can go after a bit from each of you, or choose whoever is likely to pay and get it all from them.  After he is recompensed, you can fight it out amongst the others, even go to small claims.  However, it sounds like that will be a pain in the ass.  My suggestion?  In this case, let him keep the key deposits.  It puts you out $100, but you could be out up to $585.34 if he decided to bring you in front of the LTB.  Your lesson learned is never co-sign with anyone for anything, ever, unless they are very close family (even then, it's usually a really, really bad idea and can be a definite homewrecker!)  Frankly, learning not to co-sign is a really cheap lesson at $100.  For most people, it's 5 or more digits of lesson.  BTW:  I say this as the guy who normally would tell you to use the LTB.  In this case, financially, I think you might be better off not to."

You do realize that you can also make cider with just apple juice, and pasteurization for most types of cider people make doesn't really affect it much if at all.  The only time it's critical is if you plan on making ""natural"" cider, where you don't introduce your own yeast and let wild yeasts do the work, but that is definately a lot more variable approach."

It would probably have to do with with the Health Code (sanitary issues). As well, most fest halls will have standard pour sizes that your mug may not conform to.

Anyone who does try to take a reasonable position is shouted down by the half-dozen trolls who seem to live on the site.

waterloo,2gmg6x,hippiechan,3,Wed Sep 17 23:50:48 2014 UTC,"We need these in Waterloo! Turning left is such a pain, either I have to merge into traffic (which is pretty unforgiving to cyclists, especially on Uni) or become a pedestrian and cut infront of traffic, putting myself at risk of not being seen in time for a driver to react."
waterloo,2gmg6x,superbad,1 point,Wed Sep 17 22:35:10 2014 UTC,"I can completely understand wanting them at busy intersections where it's difficult to make left turns.  I don't understand the CoW implementing them on Davenport at Lexington, and Lexington at Bridge and University.  I would love to see them at University and Weber or University and King.  Or maybe King and Bridgeport."
waterloo,2gmg6x,wildgurularry,1 point,Thu Sep 18 00:49:31 2014 UTC,"I dunno about university and king, at least not going eastbound. I wouldn't imagine why anyone would go up that hill on King street (implied by a left turn while travelling east, so north). Instead, I think they should put one westbound at King, and one eastbound at Hazel, to guide cyclists to the best way to get places."
waterloo,2gmg6x,NeuroG,1 point,Thu Sep 18 02:08:29 2014 UTC,I don't see the problem with the hill on King.  But maybe the boxes would be good on King Street instead of University.
waterloo,2gmg6x,NeuroG,1 point,Thu Sep 18 13:16:17 2014 UTC,Agreed. University st and Columbia st could use these bike boxes.
waterloo,2gmg6x,bob_mcbob,4,Thu Sep 18 01:46:18 2014 UTC,"Hmmm, I don't think I would use these if I was on my bike.  I have a strict rule that I use when I'm biking:  I never pass a car.  If a car passes me, and then we hit a red light, I wait behind the car that passed me.  If I'm approaching a red light and there are cars stopped there, I wait behind them.  I never have to worry about cars turning right in front of me, because I never sneak up on them.  I suppose this green square thingy might help prevent bikes from getting hit by oncoming traffic turning left across the intersection, but unless that is a bigger problem than I think it is, I'm not sure this will help much.  Anyway, very interesting."
waterloo,2gmg6x,jiggyns,8,Wed Sep 17 14:34:01 2014 UTC,"""Right-hooks"" can occur without necessarily passing a car. Sometimes motorists try to pass a cyclist immediately before turning right (I've even seen a school bus driver try this once), or sneak up beside a cyclist and then turn right when the light changes. If the cyclist is out front, dead centre, this isn't possible. Turning left is also much, much easier when you are first in line, and have an advanced or protected green.   Regardless, these boxes are really only helpful to affirmative, ""vehicular cyclists."" They don't really make roads easier for the average person to take to a bike, like dutch-style infrastructure would."
waterloo,2gmg6x,NeuroG,4,Wed Sep 17 16:19:29 2014 UTC,"We need more vehicular cyclists. The more we have, the safer everyone is.   An uptick in any sort of cyclist (and pedestrian) on our streets cause drivers to slow down and pay attention."
waterloo,2gmg6x,bob_mcbob,2,Wed Sep 17 16:56:30 2014 UTC,"My problem with sidewalk cycling is the number of bicyclists who go back and forth between the bike lane and the sidewalk whenever it's convenient. You're either a vehicle or a pedestrian, and switching back and forth makes your actions much more unpredictable for car drivers and unsafe for you."
waterloo,2gmg6x,NeuroG,1 point,Wed Sep 17 17:46:25 2014 UTC,I agree. I think by having more bike lanes and more people out riding these cyclists will feel more comfortable using the lanes and therefore won't hop from one place to the other.
waterloo,2gmg6x,Tarbris,1 point,Thu Sep 18 08:08:32 2014 UTC,"I'm not going to defend sidewalk cycling, but there is plenty of evidence that people on the sidewalks, regardless of what they are doing, reduce motor-vehicle speed. All you have to do is look at the number of cars that kill pedestrians in a typical year vs the number of cyclists, sidewalk or not, that kill pedestrians, and you can see that your claim is far from clearly true. If anything, sidewalk-cyclists are simply a danger to themselves.  The reality, though, is that the very ""dutch-style"" infrastructure that I mentioned that started this thread has been found to unequivocally improve cycling etiquette in the cities implemented. You have fixies bombing down sidewalks and sliding through reds in New York and Boston, not Amsterdam or Copenhagen."

waterloo,2fog19,ILikeStyx,6,Mon Sep 8 01:27:31 2014 UTC,"Rogers and Bell now use fibre for a lot of their infrastructure so it's not necessarily preparing something like a 1 Gbps run to your home.  Rogers now calls their packages ""hybrid fibre"" because it's fibre all the way to a cable box in your neighbourhood.  Bell has been replacing most of the copper wire with fibre in Waterloo for a few years now.

They're running fiber to the DSLAMs, or whatever, then offer enhanced DSL service over regular copper to the houses.  We aren't getting fiber to the house here for a while, sorry to say."

As a side note, I don't understand why you think having a credit card is bad for students.  As long as it is used responsibly, a credit card is very convenient and allows you to build credit which will be important if you ever plan to borrow money in the future.  Regarding the cost, I think you'd be grossly overreacting by moving out over this.  It is entirely normal for tenants to be responsible for cable and Internet.  I've rented many many times and the only time those were included were when renting a room in the home of the landlord.  It is not reasonable to expect your landlord to foot the bill for these luxuries (cable especially)."
waterloo,2fnxer,nkgood,3,Sat Sep 6 22:00:09 2014 UTC,"Just go out and get a credit card. You can have them set you credit limit to $0 and when you want to use it just move money onto it. Other option is to just get a 0 monthly fee card and pay it off when you make a payment. Bonus you start building your credit rating.   You don't need to pay the bill with the card. You just need it to setup the account.  Also, unless your lease is month to month you can not just give 60 days notice and move out. If your lease says a year you are there for a year or until you find someone to take over your lease."

Right off the bat you will realize that both these companies have high installation cost but the service is great, the package is way better than the others and the month-month cost are definitely lower. Unlike other companies, with Teksavvy you need to buy one of their recommended modems which is about $100, but it beats renting one for $5-7 month. Right now I pay $42/month for 300GB 25 MBPS connection. During 2am-8am I have unlimited internet. There is an option on my account if I choose to limit my speed to 9mbps during 8pm-12pm I enjoy unlimited internet throughout the entire month. Alternatively its $10 extra per month for me to get unlimited.   Quick comparison"

Edit:  also the Kitchener Powerlifting club meets there once a month so if you wanted to compete you could join the club.  Note that there are not many deadlift only competitions.

I think with your numbers you would qualify for the provincials but you would have to compete before November and still be 18.  You would be in the 93 kg weight class.

That means it is illegal for most businesses to be open on holidays. There are some exceptions for gas stations, restaurants, convenience stores, etc. so those are the places you will need to go.  The reason that places like the Eaton Centre in Toronto and Square One in Mississauga can be open on holidays is because those cities have established those places as ""tourist areas"" under the law."

waterloo,2f51lm,CoryCA,2,Mon Sep 1 21:24:26 2014 UTC,"Also, that they are paying $51.95/mo is not necessarily ""eing taken of advantage"", either because those are relatively new price levels. Last October when I went with VMedia, the 50/1 package was about $89/mo unbundled.  Given that standard business practices in pretty much any contract services industry is that you stay on the same price-plan, grandfathered in, even if future new customers pay something different, until you change your plan, I would guess that your parents signed up a few months ago before this latest price drop.  So that's still not your parents being taken advantage of, and yes, it would have been a good deal - $36 less per month for the base plan - relative to standard Bell pricing at the time."

waterloo,2f1wa2,newguy57,8,Sun Aug 31 02:02:42 2014 UTC,They are looking for distracted drivers.
waterloo,2f1wa2,LongoSpeaksTruth,13,Sun Aug 31 02:32:29 2014 UTC,"I was pulled over by one a couple of years ago. Tried to pin a distracted driver charge on me but I proved she was lying.  Edit:  Since /u/LongoSpeaksTruth wants proof I can only tell the story as I didn't get any ticket nor any court date.  I was driving up the 85 just past Bridgeport when I moved into the left lane to pass a slower moving car in the right lane.  At this point the van put on the lights which were mounted in the rad grill area.  I didn't notice the lights at first until I completed my pass of the slower moving car and went back into the right lane.  I pulled over just after the University exit ramp.  Now a little bit of backstory is required here.  I worked for BlackBerry at the time and had access to a few test devices.  The officer approached me and didn't ask for my license right off.  She immediately said ""I saw that you were using your cellphone""  I responded with ""This cellphone here beside me?"" and gestured to the test device that was on the seat beside me.  She said ""Yes"".    Immediately this was clearly a lie as this test device had no SIM in it and could only get data via WiFi which obviously none was available.  So I further baited the trap by asking for clarification if she saw me with it up to my face as if I was speaking into it.  She confirmed.  At this point I said well that's going to be difficult as I work for BlackBerry and this is a test device with no SIM card.  I showed her the screen showing no bars and then showed her there's no SIM.  She immediately changed her story asking why I didn't pull over fast enough and I responded that I'm not used to being pulled over by an unmarked white van.  She then asked me why I was speeding (at this point I knew this was just a weak attempt at getting me to admit to SOMETHING).  I said I wasn't speeding and that I just completed a pass of a slower vehicle.  She just asked me to drive more carefully and let me go."

I'd say that unless you could get a package deal with VMedia that makes it cheaper to go with them, you'd may as well go with TekSavvy.

Basically, it's my husband and I - we have Netflix, which we stream often, and the occasional large file transfers (I'm a graphic designer who freelances) - what's my best bet (my Rogers bill has come in at $80.00ish over the last few months - it's ridiculous!)?"
waterloo,2ebzk1,jonhayes37,1 point,Fri Sep 26 20:29:30 2014 UTC,"Hi!  Both TekSavvy and Start have great packages for 30 Mbps down / 5 Mbps up; the one from TekSavvy is in my previous comment and this is the one from Start.  30 down will be plenty for streaming Netflix; the only reason I recommend this plan is because if you're uploading graphics files (which I'm assuming can get fairly big), you'll want the 5 up as opposed to only 1 up in the next lowest plan.  Both of these plans run for $45 / month (A nice change from $80!).  Personally, I would go with Start, because I've never had a problem with their customer service, whereas recently I've been hearing bad things about TekSavvy's installation process.  If you have any other questions let me know!"

waterloo,2e6kkj,three-eyed-boy,3,Thu Aug 21 18:45:44 2014 UTC,"I'm actually not kidding though. I just moved into a new place and had to fire up the heater. If it's an older one like I have, you have to manually set it to pilot mode, hold down a gas release button, and light the pilot yourself. You also have to remove a few panels to get to the pilot.   You can also pay a serviceman to come do this, but it's pretty easy to do on your own."
waterloo,2e6kkj,SULLYvin,5,Thu Aug 21 19:12:31 2014 UTC,"I just call a plumber to fix my water heater.  You want to stick with gas. Even though the prices went up recently, gas cost for us in southern Ontario is far cheaper than electricity per unit of energy. For example, it's much cheaper to run a natural gas BBQ at full blast for an hour than it is to have your oven at 350 for an hour. It's the same reason why gas heating is much better than electric heating in this area.  Also, I'm sure you realize the difference, but ""replaced for free"" is not accurate. In 10 years you've saved about $3,000 in rental fees (assuming $25/month, which was the contract I cancelled when I got my house). A new water heater + installation will cost you about 1/3 of that. If you had set aside $10/month for a new water heater (in lieu of a $25/month rental) you'd have $1200 + interest right now. Of course it usually makes more sense to not organize your finances that way, but I find the comparison helpful when it comes time to replace an appliance."

It's unfortunately not that uncommon with movers, and I'd avoid kijiji.  Whoever you go with, check for reviews first to see if they pull that kind of garbage on their customers."

Also becareful with some of these companies screwing you on moving day by changing the rates on you at the last minute and showing up late so you have to pay it.  One of my friends used Two men and a Truck and they got burned and had to cancel, rent a uhaul, and call in a lot of favors with friends to get the move done.    Best of luck with it!"

waterloo,2ccdbh,ElKraken,7,Sat Aug 2 00:41:29 2014 UTC,"I highly suggest you read up on the Residential Tenancies Act in order to become more confidant in dealing with uncooperative landlords in the future.  I have had a similar situation happen to me in the past, where a landlord refused to take responsibility for damage to the house that was already present when we moved in, and then tried to blame and charge us for it when we pressed them to repair it. In all honesty, the threat they are making is probably completely empty and they are just trying to scare you into paying like mine was, but I can't guarantee that. I would suggest that you take pictures on move-in day of anything that looks questionable the next time you rent so that you have evidence of the initial state of the house.  However, since it is too late for that, I would suggest you just stay adamant in arguing your stance that the house was already in such a poor condition when you moved in and it is clearly a health hazard. If your landlord is anything like 80% of the scumbag landlords in Waterloo they will eventually back down and give up, as did mine. Also, check your lease agreement for mentions of the bedframe. If it is not mentioned at all in the agreement then there's no proof that the landlord provided it in the first place and he can't charge you to replace it."

Called uhaul and they sent us to another place to pickup and again no one was there. We went further and further until we found one which was smaller than what we reserved.  I've never hated a company so much as I hate Uhaul, that horror story of our move will forever haunt me."
waterloo,2c69ty,dufflayer,2,Fri Aug 1 21:06:01 2014 UTC,"The sad secret is that when you reserve with U-Haul the only way you're actually REALLY reserving with the people who have the truck is if you call up the location where you intend to pick up the truck and reserve with them directly.  When you reserve over the phone or the internet U-Haul will, someday, eventually, phone them and let them know.  And at that point either someone already called and reserved it, something is lost in communication, the vehicle is missing, or it's damaged.  Or you get lucky!  Really, it's about the same reliability as calling up a friend you only kinda-sorta trust who you meet with maybe once a year and seeing if he'd do you a solid and call up that local U-Haul and have them reserve one for you.  I know, it's too late now.  And you're right, U-Haul doesn't care, because it's been like this for about a decade, maybe longer.  :("

The two most common problems I saw are:   Wrong size bike Fear of riding / falling (since one leads to the other)   Correcting #1 is your job. This may require you to manipulate the seat and handlebars appropriately. Once that is done, it will build confidence to solve #2.   If your son can ride with training wheels, I could have him riding on just 2 wheels in a couple hours."
waterloo,2c1i1u,meadeater,1 point,Thu Jul 31 15:17:56 2014 UTC,"I initially thought his bike was too small – but I think the size is actually okay. We've adjusted the seat and he can straddle it comfortably with his feet flat on the ground. He doesn't need to stretch or reach in order to put them down.  I think his problem is bang-on with your second point. I think he's afraid. We simply need to get him out more often, and make sure he tries for more than 15 minutes at a time.  Your list aside, what other tips or suggestions would you have for helping a kid learn to ride a bike? His sister is ready, too, and she's 2 years younger.  My problem is, I don't know if I could even say how to ride. I get him on the bike and just sort of look at him and say ""Okay... uh... go!"""
waterloo,2c1i1u,meadeater,1 point,Thu Jul 31 15:36:08 2014 UTC,"A lot of kids have difficulty with the initial push because their legs aren't strong enough to push the pedals and stay straight for those intial 2 or 3 pedal cycles. This causes imbalance and leads to falling.  You may want to try holding the back of the seat with one hand to stabilize the bike the first few times he pushes off. This will give him the confidence that he wont fall when he pushes down on the pedal.   Another tip would be to teach him the starting position and commit it to muscle memory by himself:   Figure out which foot is stronger (probably same as the kicking foot). Let's assume right leg. He should rest his other leg (left) on the ground to hold himself up like a kickstand. Then, using the right foot, cycle the pedal backwards (it will make that clickety clickety sound) until the right pedal is at the top of the cycle. Follow me? Read that over again if necessary before going on.  Left leg on the ground like a kickstand, slight lean left, right pedal at the top of the cycle with the right food on the pedal preparing to push forward. If you were standing to his right the pedal would be at the 1 o'clock position.  THIS IS THE STARTING POSITION. He needs to practice getting in to this every time he gets on the bike. Getting on a bike? Get in the starting position. Every time.   Then push off."
waterloo,2c1i1u,coneball,2,Thu Jul 31 15:49:46 2014 UTC,"I read about this method somewhere and it has worked for all 3 of my kids and had them riding in within 45 min.  1.Find a gentle slope grass hill, one that has some concrete within coasting range works best 2. Kid on bike feet OFF pedals just coasts down hill, repeat X times to build confidence.     3.Kid on bike feet ON pedals but no pedaling coasts down hill, repeat X times.     4. Kid on bike feet ON pedals start to pedal when coasting, repeat until lightbulb goes on.  Once you take away the need for speed to stay up it lets them focus more on the pedaling, which then helps them stay up, confidence goes up and you are there.  One of my boys was literally riding in a skatepark within two days, had to brag.  Hope you see this and it helps.  edit first post formatting edit two concrete love"

When my Dad first took them off, to get me started he would hold onto the back of the seat to steady the bike while I climbed on and got both feet on the pedals. Then he gave me a big push to get going and I carried on pedalling. To stop, I would coast up to him and he would grab the bike and steady it while I put my feet on the ground. Not sure what happened from here, I guess once I was comfortable riding around I figured out how to jump on and off the seat when it came time to start and stop."

We didn't take the pedals off, we just did the traditional ol' ""run behind him while holding the back of the seat"" thing a few more times.  There's a paved path near our house which leads to a playground, and we were on that. I got him set up in ""starting position"", with one pedal up and ready for him to push on, and then held him steady while giving him a bit of a boost. He got about four rotations on the pedals before panicking and putting his feet down, and my wife could see his face. She said he had this wide-eyed look, and could see as it all clicked into place.  He's now cruising down our steep driveway, down the sidewalk, and scaring the hell out of me as he takes off down the street to his friend's house.  Thank you for all of your helpful comments."

The central corridor pulls in the lion's share of the revenues for the transit network, which will only increase as intensification occurs and ridership grows with better service.   Their fears of increases due to labour costs are also unfounded. The consortium is responsible for staffing, as part of the $19 million/year operating and maintenance costs. If the cost per unit of labour goes up for the consortium faster than the inflation rate in the contract, it won't be the Region that has to absorb the difference."

And why would hiring people be bad?   Nothing wrong with it, except I find it unlikely that every eligible single person in Waterloo region will spend money on the LRT, and we're already at $60 a head.  Those engineers will need to be paid, so that increases that amount, which means it would be more difficult for the LRT to break even."

When training for sports people spend hours training different aspects of their chosen sport under the supervision of a coach. In academic pursuits the lectures / workshops / labs are the times when the coach (prof) can point you in the right direction. In the end you have to do all the work (ie train for hours).

waterloo,2b9ge0,IUseRhetoric,3,Mon Jul 21 03:07:33 2014 UTC,It really depends on where the puncture is.  If it's in the tread you can get it repaired for $20 at most tire shops.  If it's in the sidewall then you're screwed.  If you're looking for a new tire try to get a used tire.  Tire shops will sell them cheap and there's no need to only get one new tire as it will wear unevenly with your others.

waterloo,2b0bdp,stevedore,3,Fri Jul 18 12:26:35 2014 UTC,"Vincenzo's of course. And it looks like you can even see at least some of their selection online One of my favourites is the Montforte Torta. Cow's milk soft cheese only available in the fall when the cow's milk supply is up and they are finished withe the goat's milk cheeses. I've never been to the actual Montforte production shop, but I hev been to the resturant in Stratford. It was nice but I was a bit disaapointed with the somewhat limited menu. Another fav from Vincenzo's is a green waxed cheddar from the UK, but they only seem to have just before Christmas.  Also, what about Zehr's on River Road? They seem to have a sizable selection.  There is a new cheese shop I saw in Stratford called The Milky Whey. Seems like they have a smaller selection but specialty shop that looks like it wants to grow and Stratford could probably support it.   If you get into Toronto, you have to check out the Cheese Boutique on the west side of the city. I've only been once, but it was the only place I have been with more cheeses than Vincenzo's, and they even have a cheese vault, so you know they're not messing around. I think you could go in, can't remember. It really stunk.  Another one that I might try to check out sometime is another newish one, ""The Thin Blue Line"", also on the west side of T.O."

So if your in a basement or something like that, you won't get service. If you live close to the wind away and wind zone, it may not work for you as well. Overall, pretty OK, I wouldn't say experience is happy, their customer service sux, like major epicily, but for 25 dollar a month (got 3 lines) you can get unlimited call, txt and data (throttle speed after 5gb), it's not a bad deal"

One argument against Wind though, is that if you're planning on doing travelling into Quebec, you're going to have a tough time getting coverage.  The 1700 AWS band is owned by Videotron and they don't have sharing agreement with Wind. So you're always in a Wind Away zone while in Quebec.

Generally, an employee can work more than 48 hours in a work week only if he or she has agreed in writing and was provided with the documentation.  Source: Ontario Ministry of Labour"
waterloo,2amors,AlamarAtReddit,2,Mon Jul 14 13:51:21 2014 UTC,"with the redaction from the CC employee, I think there's more issues with how they do things than just being paid overtime.  If they were part of the reason for it being removed that is."
waterloo,2amors,rathen45,5,Mon Jul 14 15:08:35 2014 UTC,"The break thing and lack of overtime are probably illegal. Most people won't report it if they want to continue working there, so it might be a nice favour to your co-sufferers to report it to the ministry of labour while you are already on your way out."
waterloo,2amors,Jory22,2,Sat Jul 19 13:24:54 2014 UTC,"no, the only thing that's mandated is a half-hour meal break after five hours and it seems these guys are going to the letter of the law. It's common to offer your employees two 10-15 minute breaks before and after lunch but it's not legally mandated.  But the no overtime thing seems quite actionable. And the ministry of labour takes a really dim view of any employer trying that shit. 5x10hr shifts should be at least six hours at time and a half. (You must be paid overtime over 44 hours.)  Anyone interested can read up on the Ontario Employment Standards Act here: http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/es/pubs/guide/index.php"

That guy is the more unknowledgeable in-store rep I've ever met.  Definitely contact the ministry of labour like some posted suggested - anything in excess of 44 hour requires paid overtime. If you have pay stubs/old schedules with hour counts, you might be able to even get what is owed to you."

waterloo,2amors,squeegeeboy,9,Mon Jul 14 19:57:23 2014 UTC,Absolutely agree! They always make me feel so stupid if I don't know something. I feel like it's customer service 101 to be respectful to the customer even if they say something dumb.

Other times you're standing around asking people to help either being ignored or they can't help you.  The people running the checkout are sometimes slow and inefficient.  Then there's the 'lame ducks' who literally don't have a clue about computers or technology which is terrible for that type of business.  Customers should be consulted by directing them to the best product for their needs and budget which means knowledgeable and personable sales staff.  Having come from a background of working at computer stores since the age of 16, I can tell you that CC is only good for pricing and direct availability.  I usually use NCIX online."
waterloo,2amors,0Yogurt0,2,Wed Jul 23 02:19:20 2014 UTC,"Heh, for sure. Went down there a few years ago to help a buddy buy parts to build a pc and his budget was pretty low. The guy was trying so hard to sell me at a certain price point, saying $450 is just unreasonable for a gaming computer. Ended up checking a couple of other stores in the area (my friend didn't want to wait/buy online) and made a decent rig for the budget.  I could tell the guy was getting pissed off once he knew I was gonna penny pinch this build, almost like he knew it was possible but he was pissed that I knew it was possible."

I stopped shopping there a while ago though prices are better else where"
waterloo,2amors,FontaineRyan,3,Mon Jul 14 16:42:45 2014 UTC,"CC is an awful experience to shop at but working there is a hundred times worse. I only lasted about 6 months before I couldn't take it anymore.   On your feet for 12+ hour shifts with maybe 1 or 2 bathroom breaks if you're lucky (and every time I asked I was met with attitude from coworkers), and my lunch break was always cut short without reimbursement because the store was always understaffed.     I was usually the sole cashier for a line wrapped around the counter spanning the length of the building. Coworkers were supposed to help by opening another till but it didn't happen the vast majority of the time.   Several times the manager was late to open the store in the middle of winter.   I showed up 5-10 min early as usual and had to wait outside in the snow for sometimes as long as an hour if the manager was late (yes it was that bad). Customers lined up at the door, angry the store wasn't open on time. No apologies from mgr, no reimbursement for my clock-in being late though it wasn't my fault. Other bs similar to this was very frequent.   What a cesspool. I know their prices are decent but they treat both their employees and customers like total shit. Don't give this company your money."
waterloo,2amors,thelatestmodel,3,Wed Jul 30 15:22:40 2014 UTC,"They do. My partner bought her computer from them. Went out, looking for a specific model. They only had the floor model left, so they gave her a discount but had her come back and pick it up. We went to pick it up a week later, after they'd called and when we did they tried to charge her full price. When I mentioned that it was a floor model, the cashier insisted it wasn't. Eventually the supervisor came out, then got another supervisor, who then got a manager. after about 20 minutes of waiting, the manager called someone and verified that it was indeed a floor model.   So we walk and bus the thing home to set it up, only to find out that they didn't take the damn password off. So I called the store and they basically said that we needed to bring it back to them and refused to give us the password so we could change it ourselves. The manager insisted that we must bring it back because they need to wipe the system. So I asked if we would be compensated for the cab we'd be taking over. ""Absolutely not. You must bring it back here at your own expense"" he told me. So then I asked why I had to pay out of my pocket and time to fix his mistake. HE HUNG UP on me!   I called head office and they talked me through wiping the computer. It was an easy process. Never going back to Canada Computers though."
waterloo,2amors,sicklyslick,2,Tue Jul 15 01:27:07 2014 UTC,"I've been there a fair number of times and the ONLY time I felt like they actually wanted me in the store was when there was a younger female sales associate. She was super helpful, knew what she was talking about, and didn't try and do any scummy sales tactics like upselling or bundles (unlike pretty much all the other salespeople there). I think that if they had even a little real competition, then they would be done for. Nobody likes shopping at a place where they feel like they aren't welcome to spend their money."
waterloo,2amors,pommedeguerre,1 point,Mon Jul 28 14:57:54 2014 UTC,"Honestly they have quite a bit of competition online, but a lot of people who aren't really knowledgeable about computers will go in store to buy everything. I guess there's enough of those kinds of customers for them to make profit.  If you really want to piss them off, find cheaper prices online for all the parts, get an online price check and set it for in-store pickup so you don't pay delivery."
waterloo,2amors,ILikeStyx,2,Sun Dec 7 02:57:46 2014 UTC,It is an awful place.
waterloo,2amors,dembonezz,2,Mon Jul 14 15:12:39 2014 UTC,"I love CC because it's like shopping online, but you get the stuff right away. I figure out what I want/need at home, print the ""shopping cart"" page, and then go shopping. All I ever ask their staff is ""where is [point to item on page]?"" and they are wonderful at that. I can get my cheap stuff fairly quick and am able to get the optimal prices.   For what it's worth, they often don't change the shelf price tags for a sale. However, the online price is the same price that comes up on their registers when they scan. It's happened 100% of the time when my piece of paper doesn't match the shelf - their computer matches my piece of paper. I always double check.  I also tell friends/family/non-techies to go to Future Shop and pick out what they want, then go to Canada Computers to actually buy it."
waterloo,2amors,Trouba95,2,Wed Jul 30 15:25:05 2014 UTC,"I will echo almost every comment that has been made in this thread. I worked in the Waterloo store a couple of years ago, and it's just as bad now as it was when I left. Most of the sales employees don't give a shit about anything (especially the ones behind the counter). The management is absolutely horrible, I have no idea how they still have jobs.   HOWEVER. There are some people in the Waterloo store who actually care about doing a good job and helping out customers. When I worked there, I prided myself on helping out anyone. The staff in the service centre are awesome, and are genuinely there to help the customers out. There were definitely a few staff there who did their best every day.   It's really sad because CC has the potential to be a great store. It has the potential to be better than any other computer shop in Southern Ontario. But management doesn't give a shit. All they're out to do is make a quick buck, and fuck the customer. Which makes it really difficult for the few people who work at the store who actually give a shit."

waterloo,2al1ba,phatcanada88,10,Sun Jul 13 16:47:09 2014 UTC,Look to the USA to see that police forces just want more and more equipment until they become little armies. There's no justification to have most of this stuff.

waterloo,2al1ba,GuidoOfCanada,7,Sun Jul 13 21:04:51 2014 UTC,I'd rather not be tasered or shot.
waterloo,2al1ba,GuidoOfCanada,1 point,Sun Jul 13 22:29:18 2014 UTC,"Options are usually a good thing, but police have a tendency to view the taser as a default option for subduing a person rather than physically intervening (when tasers are almost as dangerous as a gun). I don't believe there are an overabundance of incidents where police have been shooting people in Waterloo, so this is pretty much unnecessary."
waterloo,2al1ba,NeuroG,4,Sun Jul 13 18:27:38 2014 UTC,"As was mentioned, if WRPS havn't been shooting people too often, the taser is more likely to replace a physical restraint, rather than a bullet. In that case, the danger is in a very real way increased."
waterloo,2al1ba,NeuroG,2,Sun Jul 13 22:31:48 2014 UTC,"If that's the justification, then they should be honest about it. They are wiling to increase the risk of death to the public in order to decrease the risk to the officers."
waterloo,2al1ba,NeuroG,2,Sun Jul 13 23:02:36 2014 UTC,"That, of course, depends on the probabilities. If we are honest about this being about protecting cops at the expense of the public's safety, we can compare the likelyhood of police being stabbed with the lethality rate of Tasers. There is always going to be a threshold that our society is going to be willing to accept. It's part of the job for officers to take on some personal risk in order to protect the public.  As long as this is being pitched as a ""non-lethal alternative to firearms,"" we can't have this rational discussion."
waterloo,2al1ba,shepd,4,Sun Jul 13 23:27:39 2014 UTC,"Considering that tasers have been declared deadly force in Canada, the police officer should have the option of swapping their gun for a taser.  Use of the taser should be met with the same scrutiny as use of their sidearm.  --- My survey answer, for whatever little it's worth:  ""CEWs have been proven by the supreme court of Canada to be deadly weapons.  They have been proven in many cases to kill (for a specific example, search ""Robert Dziekański"").  Police officers all too often claim ""excited delirium"" as an excuse for why individuals who were clearly high are killed, to the point it has become acceptable for police to euthanize such individuals in this manner.  The WRPS should hold itself to a higher standard.  Besides, as we've seen already, the WRPS has invidividuals on the force susceptible to drug induced excited delirium deaths (the officers who were reprimanded for drug abuse) and part of the taser program is to test the taser on officers prior to giving them one.  You could end up killing your own force members!"""

waterloo,2al1ba,unique_pseudonym,2,Tue Jul 15 00:57:41 2014 UTC,"They should take away their sidearms. In my experience (from places with more normal gun policies) police are a lot more polite and less cocky when they are not swaggering around with glocks.

waterloo,29r5r7,Quock,2,Thu Jul 3 17:02:28 2014 UTC,I'm fairly certain those large paths are designed for cycling since they're built along busy roads that a lot of people don't like to cycle on.

waterloo,29ks0l,thecaveisreallydark,2,Tue Jul 1 18:39:24 2014 UTC,"Hmm, I don't know how to explain this, but a lot of the land in Waterloo is uneven. I've seen streets where one house will be on a little hill and the house next door will be practically a ditch in comparison. Also, I've seen a lot of houses that have a slanted backyard, which seems like it'd be annoying. Just FYI.  You might want to check out the Lakeshore area, it's a little north of the UW campus; some of the houses are rented out to students, but it's generally a quiet area with a lot of families (there's a few schools in the area). On the higher-end of the scale, there's really nice houses in the Eastbridge area and some of them have enormous lawns. If you don't mind a bit longer drive, you might also want to look into surrounding areas/towns (St. Jacob's, Woolwich, Elmira, Wellesley, etc.). It's more rural, but some of the houses out there look amazing. I used to work with 2 guys who lived in Wellesley, they bragged about their big backyards with oak trees and everything.  BTW, have a map and/or Google Maps on standby. None of the roads in Waterloo make sense. If you miss a turn, do not assume you can take the next one and circle back."
waterloo,29ks0l,thecaveisreallydark,3,Tue Jul 1 21:42:58 2014 UTC,"Where have you lived before? (so we know what kind of climates you're used to)  It's hard to answer broad questions. Waterloo, in my experience, isn't a lot different than other cities I've been to - just a bit slower-paced/quieter and more student-oriented, but there's still lots of families here, music festivals, museums, libraries, etc.  Winters aren't as harsh as some other parts of Canada, but they can get pretty bad, especially if you're not used to them. Make sure you get winter clothing and boots, and winter tires for your car (and other winter car stuff). You want to make sure your house has flashlights, and an emergency kit (first aid kit, non-perishable food, etc.) - sometimes we get bad snowstorms/ice storms/""tornadoes"" that knock out power.  You might also want to check if the Ontario government has an expectation of what you're teaching your kids, since they'll need to be up-to-date for university (or high school if you plan on sending them off then)."

waterloo,29ks0l,thecaveisreallydark,3,Tue Jul 1 18:41:56 2014 UTC,"Ooh boy, you're going to love it here... This past week has been a lot of ~40C humidex (the temperature it feels like with the humidity), and it feels like (windchill) -20C in winter. It does get quite sunny/nice in the summer otherwise though, and snowy in the winter.  Winter tires are car tires that are designed differently so they drive better on ice and snow, which you'll need if you plan on driving. You probably want to drive. There are bike lanes and a lot of people who bike, but you can't really do that in the winter. The bus system is decent depending on where you want to go, but not great. I think the LRT rail is several years away."

waterloo,29ks0l,Kosh401,2,Tue Jul 1 18:57:46 2014 UTC,"Yeah. I don't drive personally, but usually people have a set of 4 all-season tires and 2-4 winter tires (some people only switch out their front 2 tires, not sure why). Throw on the winter tires when it starts getting cold and snowy (probably Nov/Dec), then switch back to the all-season tires when it gets warm (somewhere in the March-May range)."
waterloo,29ks0l,DanLynch,2,Tue Jul 1 21:24:08 2014 UTC,"Not everyone does it, but I think those people are crazy.  Daily temps generally above 7 degrees Celsius: four all-season tires.  Daily temps generally below 7 degrees Celsius: four winter tires.  Note that, aside from the labour costs of swapping, it does not actually increase the long run per-kilometre cost of ""tiring"" your car."
waterloo,29ks0l,ILikeStyx,1 point,Tue Jul 1 22:09:31 2014 UTC,"Just to add a couple specific winter tire tips:   You want them, especially if you're not yet very familiar with driving in nasty winter weather. And don't wait to get them, stores sell out very quickly once the snow is here and then you're screwed. Get 4 Consider getting black steel rims to put the winter tires on so that the entire tire + rim can be swapped - saving you the cost twice a year of having your rubber stretched off and swapped if using the same rims year-round Downsize your winter tire size to save a good amount of money. If your car has 18"" tires, buy 17"" or even 16"" winter ones instead. Google tire size calculators. A 16"" tire will work just fine replacing an 18"" as long as its 'rolling diameter' is the same. I've bought from 1010tires.com a couple times now and saved a good bit doing that, but you have to do it during their free shipping events. Usually in September or October I think. Their newsletter tells you when, and I'm pretty sure it's the only email I get from them all year.    Good luck with your move and life in Canada :D"

waterloo,29gxe9,jschwe,1 point,Mon Jun 30 13:51:20 2014 UTC,"They sell fast enough that they don't have time to stale. At least, that's their opinion. I worked for them for a while, they're probably right on all but their least popular beans, but it's still not presenting the greatest image of coffee credibility.  The owners do honestly Know Their Shit in 90% of cases, but are a little stuck their own way of doing things sometimes.   Their coffee quality took a bit of a nosedive a few years back when they started roasting their own, but I left town and haven't had a chance to check if they recovered.  Even during the fall, it was still some if the best in town, to be fair though."
waterloo,29gxe9,Anomander,1 point,Mon Jun 30 20:58:20 2014 UTC,"That's fair enough. I am sure it's working for them, people seem to love the place. I just don't like buying anything that sits out in the open all day like that, much less coffee beans."
waterloo,29gxe9,mpd618,1 point,Mon Jun 30 21:37:37 2014 UTC,"""A Matter Of Taste"" has some of the best (or at least, most famous) coffee beans available in the world for brewed coffee.    Well, they stock Kona and Blue Mountain, both of which are the most renowned craft-crop coffees out there, but many of their conventional runs are better - not through any fault of MoT but just cause they no longer stand out like they once did.   Their cappuccino are excellent at the downtown location but quality at the uptown location is dubious at best.   In both cases someone better is nearby, though, with Pyrus just across from the bus terminal downtown and DVLB three blocks up in uptown."

It was a sinking ship for years, they were trapped by lease duration but unwilling to put any effort into the place beyond fulfilling the terms they'd signed to.   Owners were convinced it was a great locale and missed getting a real Uptown location before DVLB moved in as a result."
waterloo,29gxe9,canadianviking,3,Mon Jun 30 23:45:33 2014 UTC,"Cafe Pyrus in downtown Kitchener, across the street from the bus terminal makes excellent cappuccinos, they're probably my favourite for that.  Seven Shores also has a good cappuccino, but I like their coffee and espresso better than their cappuccinos.  Not that it's bad, it's just their coffee is really good."

waterloo,29c47u,bob_mcbob,10,Sat Jun 28 18:21:39 2014 UTC,"From the city's website:   A certain amount of common living noise - such as children playing outdoors and people talking in their backyards - is expected. However, some noises are prohibited:  ...   Loud stereo or musical equipment being played on a regular basis    It sounds to me like you have a reasonable complaint. If I were you I'd call the non-emergency police line and make a bylaw complaint."
waterloo,29c47u,CrazedLumberjack,1 point,Sat Jun 28 18:26:14 2014 UTC,"I did check that link as well as the noise by-law, and it seems to be saying any amplified music is prohibited between 5 pm and 7 am (9 am on Sundays), and during the daytime it has to be below 55 dBA as measured from any adjoining property."
waterloo,29c47u,CrazedLumberjack,3,Sat Jun 28 18:33:12 2014 UTC,If you aren't sure about 55dBA then you could wait until after 5pm and call bylaw if the music is still going. That way the stricter rules are in effect which should have a better chance of the issue being dealt with.
waterloo,29c47u,quatch,2,Sat Jun 28 18:48:11 2014 UTC,55dB is about normal conversation. It's super strict for music.
waterloo,29c47u,shepd,1 point,Sun Jun 29 17:11:37 2014 UTC,"Pick up a sound level meter.  There's one on kijiji for $20 right now (no, I have no idea whose it is, buy anything you want...)  They're not hard to use.  Stand at the closest portion of your property possible to theirs and point the meter at the stereo.  Record yourself doing this and the results.  Evidence is always helpful.  Cases like these aren't ""beyond a shadow of a doubt"" like some sort of murder case.  You just need to convince a judge that they're assholes.  This is, of course, an alternative to using the police to solve it, which is where you should start and then come back to this if you need to.  The police might take your complaint more seriously if you do meter it and provide them with numbers, though.  Understand this:  That neighbour probably doesn't see you as a threat right now, they're just generally obnoxious.  If you sue them, or they figure out you called bylaw and they're busted, you should move.  They sound like the type that will likely make your life very difficult.  Yes, it's not the morally right answer, but it is the sane answer.  It's also why I will always ask in person, nicely, before I go further.  Even if there's just a 1% chance of working out something, it's better than ending up having to move.  Even if it sucks, I would suggest negotiating with them on it, rather than just putting your foot down and saying no more.  You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar and all that."
waterloo,29c47u,Hecfret,4,Mon Jun 30 16:38:20 2014 UTC,I live right near the university and we are usually very quiet especially for students but at the start of the school year we had a party outside and without our knowing the music got continually louder. By law officers show up and hand us each a 500$ ticket for noise with no warning.

waterloo,29c47u,LongoSpeaksTruth,1 point,Wed Jul 2 03:20:48 2014 UTC,A warning is appropriate.  Often you don't know/realize you're bothering anyone until the cops show up in full asshole mode.
waterloo,29c47u,echothis,0,Wed Jul 16 00:38:07 2014 UTC,"No, actually Bylaw officers show up first. Cops only show up when YOU are in full asshole mode.  I really cannot understand how you could not know that you are disturbing other people ....it is not that hard. If you are being loud, you are disturbing people ...... It's a pretty simple concept.  I can pretty well tell by your post, that you are an immature kid, so here is some advice. Do not expect respect to be shown to you, when you do not show respect to others.  Remember, generally when cops show up in ""asshole mode"", it is because YOU are being the asshole."
waterloo,29c47u,LongoSpeaksTruth,1 point,Wed Jul 16 13:50:52 2014 UTC,"I really cannot understand how you could not know that you are disturbing other people   Allow me to provide you with an example directly from the Waterloo police scanner last Saturday night. Someone in an apartment building called to complain about loud bass coming from the apartment above them.  The police showed up to find a middle aged couple watching a movie at a reasonable volume. The couple has just bought a new TV, and the subwoofer was on the ground in the corner.  They did not know how to adjust the bass level and did not realize it was bothering anyone.   I can pretty well tell by your post, that you are an immature kid, so here is some advice.   You're dead wrong, so here's some counter-advice: don't assume you know things about people you've never even met.   when cops show up in ""asshole mode"", it is because YOU are being the asshole.   You're lucky to have never had a negative encounter with a police officer.  Most police officers are great, but when you meet a bad apple it can go wrong fast.    For me this came just over a decade ago just after I finished my B.Sc..  I was rollerblading along a residential street when a bike cop swerved into me and caused me to crash.  The officer immediately began yelling obscenities at me: ""You stupid asshole.  You're not allowed to rollerblade on the street. You're impeding traffic.""  The officer's behaviour was so aggressive that several pedestrians stopped to ask if I was ok.  Eventually the officer wrote me a ticket for running a stop sign (there was no stop sign anywhere nearby), and threatened that if I tried to fight the ticket in court he would tell the judge that I was evading arrest and that was why he ran me off the road."
waterloo,29c47u,mimsy191,3,Wed Jul 16 14:32:19 2014 UTC,"Fuck that ASSHOLE. I had the same problem a few years ago. Call By-law everyday if you need to. On weekends you may need to call the Police at 519-653-7700 and ask for dispatch to make a noise complaint.  There are noise bylaws in effect 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If music goes past the boundary of the offenders property line, it is considered too loud. The offender will be warned first, and then continuously fined. I THINK that if these fines are not paid, drivers licences cannot be renewed.  As I said I had a moron like this for a neighbor. CONSTANT loud music and boy did he love the bass to be cranked up to really vibrate the whole neighborhood. He liked to play it in his garage so as it turned his garage in to one massive speaker that blasted out in to the neighborhood. Me and other neighbors called Bylaw over and over. The guy finally sold his house and moved. I was actually hoping someone would have bashed his head in with a hammer. Then I could have walked by and laughed while I spit on his corpse !!! That is how much hatred he created in me, by his over top abuse of the neighborhood via his stereo.   TL;DR :   Call Bylaw repeatedly. You have all the rights in this situation and he has NONE !!!"
waterloo,29c47u,quatch,2,Wed Jul 2 03:17:24 2014 UTC,"If it's bothering you, it's likely bothering others. And if it's bothering you/disturbing you, then yes, you have the right to make a complaint. In general they are taken seriously. This has been my experience:   We had a house across the street (students) who partied into the early hours of the morning. This was before I moved away from home, a few years ago. They got to the point where they were keeping my sisters and I up at night, with school/sports tournaments the next day, it was ridiculous.   My parents called by-law on them via police non-emergency number, multiple times. In general it was well dealt-with. You have the option to leave your name, and to have whoever comes to deal with it come speak to you after. If you request it, there's no need to let this guy know you were the one who called. They'll keep your name and address on file in case you need to call again. Usually someone would show up within a half hour and they would quiet down. You may be asked if you would be okay with continuing should they decide charges need to be laid against the offender. We were asked that a few times. Things like, if it were to go to court, however unlikely, would you be willing to testify to the events, etc. We answered yes, and in two years of this, there was never any need to go that far.   I hope that helps. If you have any other questions, I would be happy to answer. Good luck."
waterloo,29c47u,LongoSpeaksTruth,1 point,Sat Jun 28 22:07:16 2014 UTC,"I'd actually be really surprised if it were bothering anyone else. Because of the shape of the lots, he only really has to worry about us and our neighbours on either side. One of them has a huge fence we nicknamed the Walls of Jericho, and the other is a widowed old lady who is out of the country most of the time. The stereo gear is pointed straight at our house from their house.  I'm digesting all the advice and I'll think about making a complaint. Really appreciate all the information."
waterloo,29c47u,quatch,2,Sun Jun 29 04:36:36 2014 UTC,"Called in a few. Officers come in 30min-2 hours. I used to go next door to tell them to turn it down first, but they'd ignore me. Got a $1000 fine once (according to super..). That was an excessive thing though, and they argued with the officer a lot (I could hear it next door through the walls over the AC).  It's not always a specific noise level or time of day, but if it interferes with your reasonable enjoyment of your property. 11pm-7am are the usual hours people expect to be quiet though."

waterloo,29c47u,NeuroG,1 point,Wed Jul 2 03:24:34 2014 UTC,"thats what I was saying. 11-7 is the usual time people expect to be quiet, not the bylaw time.  I doubt music audible past the property line is enforceable. The ""interferes with reasonable enjoyment"" is more likely to be sustainable. Elsewise any construction at any time would be a bylaw infringement."
waterloo,29c47u,daddywombat,1 point,Wed Jul 2 13:59:57 2014 UTC,"Sorry, I misunderstood what you were saying.......  As per my other comment in this thread, I also had a neighbor from hell a couple of years ago, who had no qualms about playing his outdoor stereo as loud as he wanted, for as long as he wanted.......  Leisure Noise (ie; music) not being audible past the property line is a very real part of the bylaw.  I am certain this aspect of the bylaw would not be enforced during the first visit or two. It would be mentioned to the offender though. However, after multiple visits to the same address, the Bylaw Officers will start using different ""tools"" at their disposal, one of which is leisure noise emanating past the property line bylaw.   Again, I do understand what you are saying now about 11-7.  The bylaws however, were written to serve everybody, not just those that lead a 9-5 lifestyle. Let's not forget that the guy that works the 10PM - 6AM shift may very well need to be sleeping at say 7PM.   As a side note, both Bylaw and Police officers work shifts   :o)"
waterloo,29c47u,NeuroG,5,Wed Jul 2 17:52:52 2014 UTC,"Talk with By-law, not reddit. They work based on complaints. If you complain, they will (eventually) come out and listen, if they judge it too be excessive, they will issue a warning or citation.   As someone who has had problems with neighbours like you describe, the only real solution is moving. Unfortunately."
waterloo,29c47u,daddywombat,3,Sat Jun 28 19:14:09 2014 UTC,I disagree. Calling it in can change behaviour. Call it in OP.
