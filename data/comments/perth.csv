It only takes on person to sue you for any of a million uncontrollable circumstances to wipe out not only your income from doing the repairs, but your day job salary as well.  No one sane does home PC work without liability insurance unless they're 15 and don't know any better. $20 an hour doesn't come close to covering costs let alone a decent profit. PC repair costs aren't exorbitant because repair guys are greedy, the operating costs are just super high.

Still perpetuating the outdated ideologies (as my father did in my childhood) ""computer nerd"", ""programming isn't a real job it's a hobby"" ""get off the computer and go outside"" etc etc  note that most parents (we're getting to a tipping point now) over the age of 26- grew up in a completely different world (as i'm sure we're all aware) I would say the disadvantage has a high correlation with the oldschool ideologies also (areas with shit internet have high amounts of old ideologies)  something that goes along with that train of thought- apparently number of youth with social media accounts like facebook have declined, maybe same thing, Parents in their 30's don't ""believe in the internet "" etc, less access means less accounts"

He had been top of his class, working really hard, doing all the right stuff and then one Saturday night he decided to tag along with his cousins and they decided to steal a car. They got caught and he was up for the same punishment as all the rest who were far more hardcore. They didn't crash the car or hurt anyone. Sure it sucked for the guy that owned the car, but do we really want to put this kid who made a bad decision in prison and basically ruin his life when he has probably already figured out that this was abad idea and will never do it again?"
perth,3dwa5l,arkofjoy,5,Mon Jul 20 07:00:51 2015 UTC,"I work at a youth centre and some kid decided to steal my motorbike. It was premeditated and very calculated. It was pretty obvious it wasn't his first time, but when he was charged, it was treated as a first time offence. Both situations are very different but the outcomes are fairly similar. This is why the justice system exists already and instead of changing the rules, they should be looking at better crime prevention strategies. I guess this step will cost them nothing and in fact, save them  bit of money.  The other issue, is the mandatory rehabilitation sessions are usually a bit of a joke."
perth,3dwa5l,Toma-,2,Mon Jul 20 07:16:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about crime prevention strategies.  There is an idea that came out of the state's called ""justice reinvestment""  they look at the post codes of all the people who are arrested.  Then they go into the communities where the top 10 percent of crimes happen and ask the people ""What would you need to stop being involved in crime"" turns out the answers are often not only simple,  they are often relatively cheap.  Things like day care so mothers can work rather than dealing drugs.  And of course drug rehab.  The program was saving Austin Texas 60 million dollars a year from not imprisoning people."

In NSW anyway, you have to get 3 ""juvenile warnings"" before you even have to face a magistrate.   Sure it sucked for the guy that owned the car, but do we really want to put this kid who made a bad decision in prison and basically ruin his life when he has probably already figured out that this was a bad idea and will never do it again?    Well, they did ""hurt someone"", the car owner had to pay to have his windows or locks replaced.

On average the get away with 14 for every one caught. Some might get caught first time, some might do 50 before they are caught. Only a fool would assume first time in court = first time criminal.  paragraph 8 refers to the clearance rate."
perth,3dwa5l,GreyGreenBrownOakova,0,Tue Jul 21 06:34:52 2015 UTC,"An increase in the burglary clearance rates of nearly seven per cent has been credited to the use of DNA profiling and new high-tech fingerprint systems.   Not a clearance rate of 7%. An increase of 7%.   There was also a significant drop in motor vehicle theft - down by nearly 24 per cent, while the clearance rates had climbed - up to nearly 29 per cent.   Your 7%, thus 14 burgs before being caught, is very wrong.  EDIT: Also, that page is more than 10 years old. It's from 2004.

This old testament,  an eye for an eye punishment model has been an abject failure.   The thing you talk of how hard a stolen car hits other poor folk is why restorative justice is so effective.  These kids start to hear how their actions really effect the victim.  And the funny thing is that when they get to the phase of discussing how the perpetrator will ""make it right"",  they are often suggesting harder consequences than the victims are asking for."
perth,3dwa5l,arkofjoy,4,Mon Jul 20 13:21:06 2015 UTC,Cannabis possession has already been like this for a while as far as I know. I got caught with a stick of weed a couple of years ago and they just require you to go to one counselling session and you get off with no record.

perth,3dwa5l,JellyMcNelly,5,Wed Jul 22 02:59:04 2015 UTC,I'd be interested to hear people's opinions on this.  I'm not 100% either way at the moment myself and am very interested in the stats once it's been in operation for 12-24 months.  Anything that turns first time offenders away from recidivism is a good thing in my book though.
perth,3dwa5l,SirGander,5,Mon Jul 20 02:28:42 2015 UTC,"At a glance it seems like a pretty good, common sense system. Personally I was extremely relieved when I got caught with a gram of weed and they told me I wouldn't have any criminal record for it, counselling and a warning. I imagine others will feel similarly with this new system."
perth,3dwa5l,JellyMcNelly,3,Mon Jul 20 07:17:25 2015 UTC,"THe thing is that the current system is a dismal failure AND really expensive.   THe definition of insanity is to continue doing the same thing over and over but hoping for a different result. So the logical thing is to look for differnt things that have been trialed elsewhere or try them here and watch the results. If they do this and it has less than 50% of the people back in the criminal justice system within 5 years, I call that a win."
perth,3dwa5l,arkofjoy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:05:40 2015 UTC,"A reduction in crime would be a better outcome for the community, and a better yardstick to use, not whether the offenders end up back in the justice system or not."
perth,3dwa5l,iihjku,4,Mon Jul 20 07:11:12 2015 UTC,"Actually there is a slim percentage of the 'criminal' populace that commits that commits the majority of crime. They wouldn't be impacted in any way by this. Rather you'd be looking at getting people before they slip into that repetitive pattern, self fulfilling cycle, that sees kids who're caught with something they shouldn't have continuing down the wrong path. For one example anyway.  So in a way I imagine it could help those few that can be turned from the path of prolific re-offending, there fore having an impact on crime stats in years to come. More likely it could see the need for more intensive intervention programs subside, as earlier intervention becomes more successful."

But the current recidivism rates are bad for the community because not only are they expensive,  they are making people worse offender's.  So a process that gets people out of the criminal justice system is definitely a win for the community."

Giving people yet another opportunity to avoid punishment might just delay the number of penalties/incarcerations by a year or so. The outcome is still the same, but the community suffers.  BTW, do you know if WA has section 10 dismissals?  I'd be interested to see the stats on 'double or nothing' with driving points. That might be another way to implement penalties for first offenses."
perth,3dwa5l,henry82,2,Mon Jul 20 07:31:25 2015 UTC,It's called a spent conviction in WA. Don't ask me what section of the sentencing act it is though
perth,3dwa5l,kells11515,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:53:56 2015 UTC,"s.45  Of interest:  (1) Under section 39(2), a court sentencing an offender is not to make a spent conviction order unless — (a) it considers that the offender is unlikely to commit such an offence again; and (b) having regard to — (i) the fact that the offence is trivial; or (ii) the previous good character of the offender, it considers the offender should be relieved immediately of the adverse effect that the conviction might have on the offender.  Police can always make a submission to the magistrate through the prosecutor. So say Joe Bloggs signed one of these agreements after he was caught with a knife at a shopping centre. Then six months later, after the agreement, he is busted again with the same offence. While he didn't go through court the first time around, the charging officers can still have it be made known to the court that he was only recently pulled up on the exact same thing.  TL;DR Having one of these doesn't automatically open the door for a spent conviction if you're caught being dumb a second time."

The point is, it's illegal to carry one for self defense - and it's really not debatable. There are a number of controlled weapons you can carry in WA with strict guidelines, keep in mind you're in the only state that allows this.  I dont know the exact situation of your friends being jumped, but you really have to evaluate what exactly went down, and what could have been done with hindsight. Lets say you did go to your car and pulled a knife, now what? You stab someone and have to deal with the rammifications. There's also the risk that you're overpowered and it's used against you. Why couldnt people go inside the house rather than the car and get a weapon? why couldn't you use say a tire iron from the trunk? Not wanting you to answer these questions to me, but it might be something worth thinking about, if having a weapon could have changed the situation.  I've never told this story, but i was in college walking to maccas with a friend, and some dude pulled up in a car looking for a fight. started abusing us, driving at our speed, yelling through the window. After ignoring the abuse for a minute or so, I eventually answered his question (politely), but for whatever reason it set him off. He got fucking angry and stepped out of his car. I reached into my pocket and prepared my knife (yes i had one, and yes i was a bit unstable at the time) - i didnt pull it out though. As he stepped out he pulled out a basebal bat and started chasing us. We fucking legged it.  Now I look back at the situation and regret carrying a knife, not only was it illegal, but it probably wouldnt have changed the outcome of the situation. If i had rushed him, he had a friend in the car, and access to the bat, he may have had a weapon himself. There's also a chance my knife could have been used against me. What if i'd stabbed him? I'd still be charged with various offenses, and if it was a he-said-she-said situation, i'd be liable aka royally fucked.   also: i didnt downvote you."

The ""we used to be Russian serfs"" (probably more than 100 years ago before the revolution) is not an equal comparison."

Send in or drop off your resume and if possible meet the admin. Be sure to let them know your availability both time-wise and subject-wise. Previous rural and remote experience can often help. I'm not sure if they still do it but some public schools used to advertise for a relief pool on the the jobs website. Good luck.
perth,3dxuvr,datenotfound,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:36:07 2015 UTC,Thanks heaps. I'm currently still studying (one unit left) so I'll have to apply for limited registration once I find a position. Would be great if I can find somewhere that needs more than the odd random day.
perth,3dxuvr,datenotfound,2,Tue Jul 21 02:18:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they still send people out to the unis but we used to tell you all about the benefits and opportunities in public schools. If you haven't already, head to the careers website. You should also consider private schools if you haven't already.   I'm not sure if anyone has told you but your qualification allows you to teach in primary schools too. There is more competition for primary school positions but depending on your secondary subjects you might be more employable and relief is taken in blocks of half days and full days rather than potentially random periods. Stay in touch with your prac teachers and look into joining your subjects' associations.  And importantly, you need to be flexible when you are starting out. I know it is a difficult decision but if you can in any way go rural or remote, do it. The odds are better and there heaps of benefits, better pay and allowances. The NT has the hardest time finding teachers so if you can hack it, give them a consideration."

Otherwise I'd be totally down for rural work, I'm even applying for ESL teaching in Korea next year.  I'm hoping the schools I visit tomorrow will have the staff back on track as well, and not attending PD days so I can speak one on one to a relief coordinator.  Thanks heaps for your help. Everything you've told me I've had to learn outside of uni from research and friends in the field, they tell us none of this in any unit I've done."
perth,3dxuvr,datenotfound,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:20:02 2015 UTC,I've got a friend who taught english in bunch of asian countries. Qualification requirements are comparatively low and so is the salary. But apparently behaviour management issues are almost non-existent if you are a white guy.  Well in defence of the unis and lecturers they have all been suffering serious budget issues in recent years. They are are in the business of turning out students with recognised qualifications but are not directly involved in the employment process. It is incumbent on the training institutions in conjunction with potential employers to coordinate relevant/useful information regarding the transition but this requires staff time and money. I don't know how much prac coordinators share with you all but they are under heaps of pressure. I had met them all and I can assure you they are without a doubt massively passionate about what they do but get hamstrung by budget and staffing limits.   I've been out of the loop for over two years but if you or any of your colleagues are after any info I'm happy to help in any way I can.

perth,3dwxga,aussiekinga,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:54 2015 UTC,"Not all real estate agents are REIWA members. Some are REIWA members, but don't pay the additional fees to have their listings on REIWA. And of course, not all real estate agents pay the bloated rates demanded by realestate.com.au either. ie. Each site has a different selection of listings and neither has 100%.  You might see longer days-to-sell on realestate.com.au because the agents want their listings to stay visible longer (the fee is per listing, and isn't pro-rate refunded if the property sells sooner). This means that:   their name is advertised longer (branding/exposure) anyone calling to ask about that property becomes a potential contact (""Sorry, it has sold, but I do have these similar properties you might be interested in!"") -- despite the fact that this pisses people off to no end."

perth,3dwxga,ShadyBiz,2,Wed Jul 22 02:57:04 2015 UTC,"My understanding that the 13939 figure is based on metropolitan listings. REIWA search covers the entire WA market.  I would also guess that the the 13939 figure does not include properties Sold or Under Offer, where as the REIWA search will still show homes Under Offer and some homes that have been sold.  Another fact to take into account that all figures only include properties for sale by REIWA members, some Real Estate agencies are not REIWA members and therefore do not advertise on their website, there is also a small number of private sellers as well who cannot list on REIWA's website portal.  The way and timing the different companies get the sales data varies.  REIWA get their data directly from Real Estate Institute members, often in real time, meaning that it is generally the most up to date, they then get any data that is missing from Landgate.  RP Data get their data from Landgate, they also call agents so they don't have to pay for it.  They then sell that data back to agents.  This data is generally older.  Realestate.com.au get their data from agencies. I don't think REIWA would make up data, if anything I would think they are the most accurate."

Hard to believe something we started rolling out over 10 years ago is apparently so hard to implement over east.   Whenever the PTA does anything here, they find the worlds best example and copy it exactly. There's no arrogance that they should be doing things some sort of unique way.

Not exactly sure what you mean by 'simple' though. In terms of zones and variety of pricing across the network ours is more complex than Melbourne. They only have 2 zones for ticket prices. Sure they have a lot more spur lines but that's the only complexity above Perth they have and spurs are not exactly difficult to work out. No rings or anything like that."
perth,3dvzv8,aussiekinga,2,Mon Jul 20 01:40:28 2015 UTC,"Actually, there is the metro loop in Melbourne which all lines lines run through, each going to a wildly different part of the city. so rather than one central station there are 5. All of which also connect to the various light rail lines. And services go through that loop in both directions.  Meanwhile over here we have one central station where all lines go and two stations where you can transfer between the Armadale/Thornlie line and the Midland line."
perth,3dvzv8,doggie015,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:13:05 2015 UTC,"Thats a small loop around the CBD, and as you said all the trains go to all 5. Thus you don't have to go to a specific station to get a specific line from the CBD.  Sydney has true loops outside the CBD."
perth,3dvzv8,aussiekinga,3,Mon Jul 20 05:08:29 2015 UTC,"In Melbourne most trains go to all 5 stations but not all do. Certain lines skip the loop, some lines change direction half way through the day and some go through the loop on weekdays but not weekends. It is actually pretty complicated.  The biggest issue though is when all trains share the same track (regardless of how long for), when one line is delayed all the others are impacted too. That's what great about having 3 completely separate lines - Armadale/Thornlie, Midland/Fremantle and Joondalup/Mandurah. If one is delayed the other two keep going like normal."
perth,3dvzv8,theenglishguy72,2,Mon Jul 20 08:01:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's simpler in other ways, like the consolidated SmartRider for example."

Transperth trains are fucking real solid. Almost always run on time, only times they don't is when theres a power outrage or suicide and they handle crime pretty well. I remember one time our train stopped at a station but none of the doors opened only for the driver to announce there had been a robbery in the opposite cars so they're just waiting for the guards to arrive to handle it. Was only stopped for a few minutes and got treated to a nice show of some ratty ass motherfuckers getting their shit handed to them."

perth,3dvzv8,rock_callahan,2,Mon Jul 20 05:27:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't know if I agree with you re the bus service. I used to catch a bus to and from home every single day for 7 years. I reckon it was on time 95% of those trips. I think you are just more likely to remember the bad experiences. That or there was some sort of horrific amount of road works on your route for a long period of time.   As duke said dedicated lanes and traffic signals can make things more reliable. The other is sneaky timetabling. In Gold Coast they made their light rail operator pay a fine every time it was more than 4 minutes late. So what'd the operator do? Change the timetable so instead of possibly running late, it was usually driving slower than it could and waiting at stations so that it was always ""on time"".   But most likely when you were in Germany you were a tourist and not getting a peak period, peak direction bus. There's no major cities not affected by congestion."

perth,3doyfz,aussiekinga,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:37:02 2015 UTC,"I would be interested to see whether rather than implementing a uniform reduced speed, artificially created congestion waves would have a higher overall throughput. In the same way that an s bend can artificially increase spacing between cars, even after the bend. If we had for example;  Freeway A during peak with 100km/h limit.  Freeway B during peak with 80km/h limit.  Freeway C during peak with 1/3 110km/h, 1/3 80km/h, 1/3 110km/h  which would have the higher throughput vs safety, something is making me feel like freeway C would have higher safety and throughput, I have no evidence for that feeling however."
perth,3doyfz,obzelite2point0,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:55:18 2015 UTC,"In terms of how variable speed limits generally work Freeway C is going to be best, yes. As long as the sections that are 80km/h are assigned dynamically through a system fed information from live traffic data (which is what MRWA is looking at). Active VSL control only lowers speed limits in certain locations that hit certain thresholds for criteria (usually the % of road occupancy gives the best indication of expect flow breakdown. Certainly better than straight counts/minute or average speed at a section). So Area A might be dropped one day as it meet certain criteria, but not other days. Another day it might be Area C.  It should be noted that Freeway C is actually near what we have currently in Perth, just not with varying locations and not dynamically assigned. The central areas around the CBD is fixed at 80km/h due to higher traffic and the number of weaving movements. It is bad going through there currently, but it would be much worse if the limit was held at 100km/h through there."
perth,3doyfz,aussiekinga,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:37:43 2015 UTC,"an alternative would be to have a ""spiked"" speed limit, as the most significant factor seems to be acceleration, if you can keep the average acceleration above the deceleration, stoppages don't happen. perhaps within a 300m section have the limit climb 20 or 30 km/h and then drop ten, eg freeway on ramp, climbs from a 60km street to 110 then back to 100 just before merging with freeway"
perth,3doyfz,koalanotbear,2,Sat Jul 18 03:36:14 2015 UTC,"I get what you are saying, but this wouldn't work.  Going back to your original post, you mentioned:   artificially created congestion waves would have a higher overall throughput.   which I think is where you have gone a little wrong. VSL, as I described the system above and in your Freeway C idea, is so get rid of the congestion wave. VSL decreases the congestion wave (as it occurs less often and less severely at lower speeds) not increases it. Increasing it and artificially creating it is not a good idea. It does decrease throughput, but more than that a wave greatly decreases safety, especially in places where people tailgate.  The idea is to get consistent flow across an area. Having a continual up and down of speed limits won't work because at the speed limit drop you will get some level of a wave created and waves always propagate backwards in traffic, thus it shall not stay at the speed drop location but shall move backwards into your 'high speed' areas. To change speed limits too often or over too short a space will likely cause a series of waves propagating through the network - which is actually what we have now and what we are wanting to avoid."

Have you actually been there and driven in these places? Their roads are a whole lot more congested than perth's.  Ill bet you that they will be blanketing very large, consistant runs of the freeway with lower limits, comgestion will continue to get worse, as they open emergency lanes to traffic the number of cars on the freeways will increase, causing further congestion on freeway (moving it from other roads)   If they had a fixed location for decreasing speed, there would not be propogation backwards through traffic,   Congestion on mitchel and kwinana is prominant at fixed locations, the problem  with kwinana lies in the capacity at locations ( canning highway north onramp canning hwy south exit, roe highway north exit, roe highway south onramp,  leach hwy south exit.) Mitchell has an etirely different problem, in that there is flow turbulance problem, traffic wants to flow across lanes, especially on the flow in/out of the cbd. Congestion waves aren't much of a deal on mitchell, moresoe the exit flow rates further up are hampered by the light intersections, traffic backs up off the exit ramps, if flow off there could be improved the entire run would end up quite smooth regardless of speed limits.   One major thing that you're missing, is that the perceived travel time is by far the biggest influence in this game. More important to the current govt than total throughput.

perth,3doyfz,OptimalCynic,0,Sat Jul 18 03:22:56 2015 UTC,Still nothing to deal with tailgating. I can't believe they haven't looked at following distance cameras - think of the revenue!
perth,3doyfz,tenminuteslate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:15:24 2015 UTC,"WA police are already using tailgating cameras.  They just aren't as common.  I've driven through a tailgating camera and wondered what the f it was.  I looked it up and it turned out to be a combined speed/tailgating camera.  Looks like a small handicam mounted on a tall tripod.  Not a large camera on a squat tripod.  How about we forget about this camera bullshit and reintroduce REAL traffic police that don't sit on the side of the freeway with speed cameras and instead enforce all the laws like tailgating, keeping left, electronic device usage, indicating when you change lanes and inappropriate speeding."
perth,3doyfz,OptimalCynic,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:41:13 2015 UTC,Maybe they should also have cameras to stop the dickheads who hog the right hand lane 'doing the limit' and stopping free flow of traffic.
perth,3doyfz,tenminuteslate,2,Tue Jul 21 06:52:56 2015 UTC,"In my experience they're not so much ""doing the limit"" as ""doing the same speed as the car in front of them"". Regardless, it's a far, far less serious problem for traffic flow than tailgating."
perth,3doyfz,OptimalCynic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:01:31 2015 UTC,"""doing the same speed as the car in front of them"".    No, I'm talking about the idiots with no cars in front of them who stay in the right hand lane."
perth,3doyfz,koalanotbear,0,Tue Jul 21 06:30:37 2015 UTC,And what's stopping you from going past them in the other lane?
perth,3doyfz,aussiekinga,2,Sat Jul 18 11:49:10 2015 UTC,"The other car they are usually driving alongside.  People who don't understand the rule ""keep left unless overtaking"" on the freeway really make congestion worse."
perth,3doyfz,koalanotbear,-3,Sat Jul 18 12:10:01 2015 UTC,"Well if they're going faster than the other car then they're overtaking so you can suck it up.  If they're going slower then the other car then just change lanes and you'll get by them.  If they're going the same speed as the other car then you need to realise that this almost never happens except in heavy traffic, where you'd just end up stuck to the bumper of the next car ahead anyway.  Seriously, there's no justification whatsoever for tailgating. It's dangerous, it slows down the traffic flow, and it makes everyone else suffer for your toddler-like impulse control."
perth,3doyfz,aussiekinga,2,Sat Jul 18 12:20:58 2015 UTC,"Well if they're going faster than the other car then they're overtaking   not a problem.   If they're going slower then the other car   Then they're a tool (unless in heavy traffic).   If they're going the same speed as the other car then you need to realise that this almost never happens    Not sure where you're driving.  Happens frequently on the Mitchell, and anywhere near Mandurah.   Seriously, there's no justification whatsoever   For not keeping left unless overtaking."
perth,3doyfz,koalanotbear,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:32:08 2015 UTC,"I agree, they are a tool. If you tailgate you're a much bigger tool so I'm not sure what the problem is here. It's like trying to treat a stubbed toe by kicking a brick wall as hard as you can."
perth,3doyfz,ROCK_SET,-1,Sat Jul 18 12:59:30 2015 UTC,"tailgating only contributes to traffic problems when the tailgater has an automatic car and keeps hitting the brakes, probably half the ministers in wa parliament are tailgaters if their personalities are anything to go by  Edit.  I dont support tailgaters and hate being tailgated but, Explanation: A tailgater simply acts as a truck and trailer, as long as they match speed and braking with the car infront (which a manual can do and an auto cannot) they don't play a part in affecting the outside system, they basically act only as a congoined twin to the car infront. If the car infront has to break, that is an outside influence that is not the fault of the tailgater. And will not change the affect on the next car behind. Tailgating should be banned and laws against it enforced, but this is because of autos and safety, and they are dicks."
perth,3doyfz,gizza,4,Sat Jul 18 13:03:36 2015 UTC,tailgating only contributes to traffic problems when the tailgater has an automatic car    haha. No.   where did you pull that idea from?
perth,3doyfz,tenminuteslate,-2,Sat Jul 18 13:12:22 2015 UTC,"manual cars coast in gear to slow down on the freeway, so the brake lights don't go on and the car behind doesn't react, whereas automatics have to hit the break to slow down, causing the following car to react"
perth,3doyfz,OptimalCynic,4,Sat Jul 18 13:14:20 2015 UTC,"So the lead car is auto, it has to break. the tailgater uses his gears to slow down. except he is tailgating and gears slow a lot slower than brakes. So he either has to brake or he hits the car.  Your theory only works if the 2nd car has enough space to allow the gears to slow them down quick enough, in which case they aren't going to be tailgating."
perth,3doyfz,Luckyluke23,-2,Sat Jul 18 11:14:17 2015 UTC,"that's only if the car in front has to slow down, which would mean the tailgater has no implication in affecting the flow of traffic. If you look at it objectively for a second.  I am not a tailgater, I hate tailgaters and would never support anyone tailgating, however facts are facts.  they actually don't negatively affect traffic flow unless they are in an automatic that can't slow by coasting."

New Moon is by far one of the best Dim Sum houses in Perth today. The food is incredibly fresh and good, and the service is what I describe as ""psychotically good"" - they are almost TOO attentive.   TL;DR : People who complain about MSG are culinarily clueless, and scientifically bamboozled. The anti-MSG movement is no smarter than the ""Gluten Free"" movement. YES there is a small percentage of people who are Glutamate sensitive, same as Gluten intolerance. NO they are not a majority, and they are in fact around less than 5% of the population - everything else is imagined."

Dragon Palace is an ok second place if you have no choice, but it's overpriced and overrated.   Yummy BBQ in Myaree is medium to good, if you're caught SoR and have no other choices... Also they're so used to ""Gwai Loh"" that you have to ask for Red Vinegar sauce when you get Steamed Shanghai Dumplings, every. single. time.  For some reason they're also really stingy about giving extra chilli oil. Otherwise, pretty delicious though, despite these annoyances.   Applecross Chinese also do really nice Dim Sum, but unfortunately it's obviously not that popular, so rather than them driving a cart around with lots of stuff, you usually have to order what you want.

I couldn't help but think of this other stupid law we have here in the west regarding owning or procuring material that has been refused classification - i.e. banned games.

Five or ten years from now, when there press isn't all over them and they aren't trying to get governments to change long standing law, do you think it'll still be the same? They've got safety problems now.  The current system is not great and could certainly be improved, but trusting that Uber will do the right thing just because or that the fact that a lot of taxi fairs in Perth are unprofitable will be solved by deregulation is stupid and naïve."

I'm a bit of a hustler and will take advantage of any opportunity to spruke one of my products, but man... I wasn't mentally prepared for that morning call in and was shaking afterwards for about an hour.  There's a bit more about the Squishy Forts origin story here - TLDR: Combine idea conceived in early morning hours of Startup Weekend Perth with Kickstarter launching in Australia and an entrepreneurship assignment for my MBA class, and you get Squishy Forts.  Just a few things:   I'm Canadian-Australian (born here, Canadian parents), so for those that heard me on the radio, that's the accent. 20 months since Kickstarter ended and I'm still going through my manufacturing process. My background is decidedly NOT in product manufacturing, so there were a  lot of lessons and frustrations along the way... but I've started to ship rewards now. Tried to make it in Australia, but too hard. Nobody even wanted to talk to me, let alone quote me a price. Dabbled with China but ended up settling on an American manufacturer for two reasons - 1) 90% of my customer are in North America and 2) They offer manufacturing AND fulfillment while still being competitive with Chinese pricing. Because it's American made, shipping to Australia is a bit tricky. We've managed to get the package size down quite small, but still pretty prohibitive to ship out here. I've got a plan that may see this shipping price come down, but it probably won't be til the end of the year. In the meantime, those that want to get one now will have to pay the premium for shipping.   At the risk ofspamming this sub, for thsoe that are interested in getting one, I will be re-opening pre-orders soon and in the meantime have opened a waitlist on the Squishy Forts website.

perth,3dh7zm,showmanic,5,Thu Jul 16 07:14:34 2015 UTC,"I think it's just really unfortunate timing. There have been gas bus fires in 2012, 2013, 2014, and one on Tuesday which I think is the first of the year. The one today is a diesel bus which is a very safe bus type. As the media release said, one hasn't caught fire in a very long time. Coupled with the crash on Wednesday, it really has been a bad week.  Edit: Fixed some dates. Also apparently have been more than 3 gas bus fires, I guess I'm way off. I'm sure somebody can correct the amount."

They found her as a stray so there isn't much history on her. She was hiding in the little cubbyhole where no one could see her and she looked terrified. She was also all skin and bones. And she had a cut on her back leg, a sun burnt nose, and no voice (not sure if she was too weak or just unwell and lost her voice). She just found shelter life terrifying and they had her labeled as ""shy"".Also they had to shave a number of spots to check if she was fixed and then more to actually fix her. So she's covered in temporary bald spots (which will grow back soon enough). Point is no one was going to adopt her if she was still in the shelter which is horrible because she's the sweetest kitty ever. And I don't think she's shy, she waits by the door for you every morning and runs over to greet you. She really needs someone that will love her forever."

perth,3dg7h5,gattaaca,14,Thu Jul 16 00:48:32 2015 UTC,Yes thats right. Many traffic lights do that. The driver has to make sure the intersection is clear before proceeding.
perth,3dg7h5,nrki,8,Thu Jul 16 00:56:26 2015 UTC,Perth drivers don't all know this. :(  I've even seen a police car not give way to pedestrians crossing in this manner.
perth,3dg7h5,ROCK_SET,-6,Thu Jul 16 02:07:53 2015 UTC,"The majority of traffic lights in Perth work such that the lights for cars don't go green until after the pedestrian light has stopped flashing and has gone solid red.   Whilst the guy you're replying to is technically correct in that the road traffic code requires vehicles to give way to pedestrians, in reality if you're turning right on a green, you wouldn't typically expect that pedestrians should have simultaneous right of way directly in your path. It's dangerous to program lights in this manner, not only for pedestrians, but also for the risk of being rear ended if you're the car in front stopping mid-green for unexpected pedestrians."
perth,3dg7h5,netizen__kane,3,Thu Jul 16 04:46:48 2015 UTC,for at least a year most CBD lights have gone green a few seconds after the perpendicular pedestrian lights have turned green.
perth,3dg7h5,doggie015,6,Thu Jul 16 06:53:42 2015 UTC,"The majority of traffic lights in Perth work such that the lights for cars don't go green until after the pedestrian light has stopped flashing and has gone solid red.   I wouldn't say majority at all. In the CBD, there is total inconsistency in how the pedestrian traffic signals work, and thats from one block to the next.   Corner of William St and the Terrace has got traffic lights where the pedestrians go first (in one direction) followed by the cars who must give way to any remaining pedestrians. Corner of William and Hay, and William and Murray, are both trialling the countdown timers. Corner of William and Wellington is all over the shop due to the strange junction, but they use the red flashing light system on some crossings.   in reality if you're turning right on a green, you wouldn't typically expect that pedestrians should have simultaneous right of way    You would do if you knew the road rules. What do you do when there is a green light but no pedestrian signals? You give way to pedestrians. What do you do if you have a green light but you see a pedestrian that has started to jaywalk across the road? You give way to pedestrians."

perth,3d84kc,moustachaaa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:49:22 2015 UTC,This is true. I wonder if it was one of the new busses as they had a lot of new fire suppression systems inserted in them to prevent this issue. I was involved in a minor way with volgren/volvo when they were updating the busses and it was something they were really looking at tackling (as you would hope).
perth,3d84kc,beccaannw82,2,Tue Jul 14 09:02:03 2015 UTC,Transperth said it was a Mercedes. The wiki page for the bus says that 14 have caught fire in the past :|

It will help keep you calm, and help you think of what to do. get a plate number. given a choice, always get away! if you do get away, still report the incident."

Yelling, gesturing. He gets out, walks up to her door and tries to open it. Because it's locked he can't. All the time he's yelling abuse at her.

Connections to south east Asia aren't that great as well considering they are relatively close. StarCraft 2 for example is much better on the US server compared to SE Asia  Depending on the game you may find a few local servers but most of them are being hosted over east these days.   WA used to have a great online PC community but outside of a few steam groups its dead these days as most server hosts and communities have either closed down or merged with others to be Australia wide.

Problem is the light rail would have been servicing the QE2 site, which is going to see a massive upswing in the amount of visitors in the next few years. I don't see the scope for bus lanes on riverside (one small stretch being built outside UWA right now doesn't count), and Thomas road is a shit-fight as it is.   I'm always a little sceptical of claims that bus services can reach the same level of speed, people and punctuality as any kind of rail. It reminds me of when the discussion around the Mandurah line was being had, and you had some fairly vociferous arguments that rapid bus lanes would be better than the train... Which in retrospect just seems absolutely idiotic (given the capacity and speed of train v bus, and the fact that using feeder buses rather than all of them heading to Perth gives you wider coverage).   If you have a Bus service going through Esplanade or Roe, you're going to have variable delays at peak times. Rail forces you to create dedicated tracks, whereas the Bus route inevitably sees shared lanes and entry/exit points."
perth,3d7dzh,Chief_White_Halfoat5,4,Tue Jul 14 04:17:25 2015 UTC,"RTBs are really efficient. the best part is that capacity upgrades and route changes are super cheap.  one thing that would really make it worthwhile would be to ensure that the busses were 100% electric, and to charge them from solar or wind power offest ( the same way the new desal plat is powered )"
perth,3d7dzh,rektevent2015,3,Tue Jul 14 05:13:37 2015 UTC,"If it's implemented correctly, with dedicated lanes etc, it might actually work better.  A RTB would have the ability to modify it's schedule a lot easier, add more buses to the route without significant cost, they are able to trial new routes (even without dedicated lanes) if there's demand etc.  There are a lot of benefits to this malleability of schedules, especially in the early stages.

Anyone who has driven in Melbourne will know what I mean.   If Perth drivers can't merge or indicate correctly on a roundabout, there is no way in hell they will be able change the way they drive to accommodate trams. I also don't have much confidence in our state government having the foresight to iron out these issues prior to building a light rail. They will put all their energy into a rainbow serpent design for the tram or working out what perthonality to name it after. Functionality and scalability are usually an afterthought.  We should stick to what we are familiar with and use busses."

One day they might not even need a driver (more likely than a bus).

perth,3d32y1,xyrgh,13,Mon Jul 13 07:06:38 2015 UTC,"Firstly I think this is a great idea, we need a rail link to the airport and this seems like one of the most sensible ways to do it, however....  This proposed Forrestfield station will mean that the Armadale and Midland lines come within 6-7km of each other, the Kenwick station is VERY close by and inbetween the two stations is mostly paddocks that are not developed so not much bulldozing will need to take place and the land should be cheap, I will be very upset if there isn't any thought put into connecting the two lines together, I mean really if you are that close it will cost at maximum $70m (the Joondalup and Mandurah lines cost $10m / km)  Furthermore I read that there is going to be one station at domestic, one at international and another in Forrestfield - if you are going to put all the money into building rail all the way to the airport PLEASE put another station in Welshpool. If you are at the airport, you are already at Welshpool - just chuck it in here somewhere and built a crappy footbridge over Tonkin Hwy http://puu.sh/iXnbD/e675a9159d.jpg  Welshpool is the largest industrial area in Perth but only has the one train station which is on the far outskirts of the western side, put one on the east side too - as it's all industrial you will find that even the shittiest train station with 3 parking spaces will probably do the job just fine as there is no residential in the area so you don't need to build a mega station with 10,000 parking spaces.  http://puu.sh/iXn7e/b50bffef39.jpg  Just look at this map and think that if anyone inbetween the Midland and Armadale line want to travel between each other they need to go through the CBD putting unnecessary stress on the network, instead people could just take a quick detour via the airport and suddenly living in Armadale and working in Midland (or vice versa) becomes a easy reality. iirc the Armadale line is being extended to Byford soon too.  Another consideration is that if one station has technical issues the entire network grinds to a halt, if there were more interconnections it could just divert without problems.   I'm probably dreaming but It would be great if the Mandurah line could be linked to the Armadale/Thornlie line via Roe Hwy too. Simply build a new station at Bibra Lake, one at either end of Canning Vale. Spencer Road could fairly easily be modified to have a train line in the middle for a few hundred meters and Roe Highway already has a massive divider in the middle. If this was done you could go from Mandurah to the airport without stepping foot in the city and all the people working in Canning Vale wouldn't need to drive to work.   Haven't even mentioned the Ellenbrook line yet :\"
perth,3d32y1,Duideka,4,Mon Jul 13 08:20:47 2015 UTC,"Preaching to the choir mate. I've always believed they should be joining Armadale & Midland Lines. Again, being in Forrestfield, the only choice you had to go to Midland or Cannington was the 294 bus that operated every 50 minutes, it was shit.  They could also reopen a line up through Greenmount where the government still owns railroad land and open up the hills a bit."
perth,3d32y1,xyrgh,5,Mon Jul 13 08:25:59 2015 UTC,"And link the Fremantle Line to the Mandurah line down through south Freo! That would be Cool!

perth,3d32y1,MikeAppleTree,3,Mon Jul 13 11:47:21 2015 UTC,"I think you are underestimating costs. Butler Extension cost $240million, thus about $40m per km.  Also, the pathway they are looking at will go nowhere near Welshpool, unless you are suggesting that from Forrie it turns and runs down alongside the Westnet rail lines."
perth,3d32y1,aussiekinga,3,Mon Jul 13 08:31:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're probably right, but tbh even if it ended up costing $300m that still seems like reasonably good value considering the amount of cars it would likely take off the road, and pressure removed from the inner city train stations."
perth,3d32y1,Duideka,2,Mon Jul 13 08:33:09 2015 UTC,I agree that a ring line around Roe-Reid would be a great idea.  As someone else mentioned earlier the initial plan for hte Mandurah line was to partially follow Roe. There is already a tunnel that goes from the Jandakot side of Kwinana under hte freeway and up into the rail reserve. They could use that to link into hte Mandurah line.
perth,3d32y1,aussiekinga,2,Mon Jul 13 08:37:31 2015 UTC,Theres also that tunnel along the freight line that the Mandurah Line would have taken through Thornlie. A future rail line could follow the freight corridor toward Freo as it goes through a few residential areas.

perth,3d3pjg,ExpertButtonClicker,3,Mon Jul 13 08:02:00 2015 UTC,"The main benefit of light rail is that you get a better passenger/driver ratio. Anyway like I said, I don't think it would ever go through the cbd as the terrain is too steep"
perth,3d3pjg,henry82,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:47:03 2015 UTC,"You mean like trams? But then, aren't you losing the use of two lanes for infrequently running trams?"
perth,3d3pjg,vbevan,0,Wed Jul 15 15:05:36 2015 UTC,"well technically yes, but if you have/had them as bus lanes anyway, it's not exactly a huge loss.  If the population of perth significantly expands, you'll want rail like that to connect major business hubs.  At the very least, the government should be preparing for these events by creating bus lanes that could be converted at a later date, and not selling properties that could be required. It doesn't hurt to have a plan, even if you don't intend to be using it in the short term."
perth,3d3pjg,henry82,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:22:51 2015 UTC,"You're right, but there's no room in the CBD for that. Even the two lane roads have on street parking so they become single lane for large portions of the day.  I just don't think any of the CBDs roads are wide enough to support light rail."
perth,3d3pjg,vbevan,0,Thu Jul 16 03:56:04 2015 UTC,"I think that light rail would extend east/west along terrace road or riverside drive, and then would take over the existing bus lane over the causeway. As for the west side, i'd guess it would head down past UWA. but eh, i'm not a town planner.  I'm guessing that if a new town centre/town hub was to be created, it would be cannington or that area around west jolimont.  Just look at sydney george street. They're converting one of the busiest roads in the sydney cbd (from this)to a shared pedestrian/light rail hybrid. Traffic basically has to fuckoff elsewhere, and there arent good alternatives imo.   That's why i really think they need to organise this stuff now, rather than waiting until shit really hits the fan and they have to make a bad decision."
perth,3d3pjg,henry82,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:12:48 2015 UTC,I think the cat bus is pretty good. Why not extend that service further out?
perth,3d3pjg,vbevan,0,Thu Jul 16 04:16:37 2015 UTC,"The cat bus is good, but it is bottle necked with existing traffic. The yellow line is almost perfect to be converted to light rail imo."
perth,3d3pjg,henry82,8,Thu Jul 16 04:23:02 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of light rail... but if it is not viable so be it. However, couldn't they have worked that out years ago. They did a tour looking at European light rail systems years ago and thought it was the bees knees. Could it be that Europe has a higher popular density?! (although Singapore does too)"

Everyone knows that public transport isn't going to ever make money in Perth, so what criteria are they using?   My biggest criticism is that whilst light rail might not be viable, it is more viable than other projects - like the airport rail. If Perth doesn't have the population density for light rail, then it definitely won't have the density for heavy rail to the airport"
perth,3d3pjg,NotAWittyFucker,2,Mon Jul 13 09:48:51 2015 UTC,"What makes a project viable though? Everyone knows that public transport isn't going to ever make money in Perth, so what criteria are they using?   To answer your first question, viability is established in a project's Business Case, as is desirability and achievability. These should be continually reviewed through the life of a project, and usually never ever are unless it's about securing the initial cash or someone wants more cash.  And given that plenty of people get certified in Best Practice disciplines (either in ITSM or Project Management) don't actually have any idea on how to apply them in a real world scenario and managed service providers for the overwhelming part talk the talk without being able to crawl the walk let alone walk it, the criteria is likely that whoever's advising Nalder, to answer your second question, isn't using any. And as much as that pisses me off, the fact that people just don't understand this mode of thinking yet is the reason why as a consultant I'll never be short of work in this country.   Having not drawn up a Business Case in consultation with experts on how viable Light Rail would be for Perth, I won't comment on how viable it is, except to point out that Singapore is a completely different Mass Transit environment to Perth and comparing Singapore to us is comparing Oranges to the Big Pineapple.  Light Rail in Singapore is not viable largely because they have one of the most coverage extensive, cost efficient, proportionately utilised and qualitatively best Mass Transit subway systems on the planet. When you can use that subway to get wherever you need, Light Rail that has to compete with ever increasing car traffic for rare space above ground, of course Light Rail is not viable there."
perth,3d3pjg,Muzorra,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:14:28 2015 UTC,Good points.  Singapore also has some of the most ruthlessly managed traffic on earth.  Perthies wouldn't put up with it.
perth,3d3pjg,Muzorra,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:54:57 2015 UTC,I thought the Joondalup line had been profitable ever since it opened
perth,3d3pjg,theenglishguy72,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:53:15 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of that.   I know that for Transperth as a whole, only 40% of the operating cost is covered by fares - and it's roughly the same for buses and trains. Sounds pretty bad, but it is a similar level to the London underground or the NYC subway, and far better than other cities in Australia. Only a few systems worldwide are profitable - some in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore"
perth,3d3pjg,Muzorra,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:31:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe it was for a period just after it opened.  Or it was exceeding optimistic expectations, or something.  I vaguely remember that, after being essentially forced to finish it (public transport is the devil's work, doncha know), Court the Younger's government was said to be trying very hard to ignore what a hit it was.  What kind of a hit exactly I don't know."
perth,3d3pjg,theenglishguy72,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:48:54 2015 UTC,"It might have been at the start, but when you have to start doing maintenance, costs go up pretty quickly.  I think the Joondalup and Mandurah lines provide a higher proportion of revenue from fares than the other lines (less maintenance and more passengers) - but probably not profitable"

The best thing Perth can do is prepare and clear space for light rail, so its easy to implement in the future if things change. You can make those paths into bus lanes in the meantime.  Also light rail would need to go around the cbd, St Georges terrace from the east is too steep"
perth,3d3pjg,Macca2805,3,Mon Jul 13 07:55:46 2015 UTC,Yep bus lanes are fine now and they'll mean we force ourselves to have room for light rail should it be required.

perth,3d3pjg,GreyGreenBrownOakova,6,Mon Jul 13 12:49:39 2015 UTC,"why is now different?   Because there were no cars and busses then?  When cars and buses became ubiquitous, the tram's patronage plummeted.   The problem with trams is, unless there is some way of making them faster than buses/cars, they aren't going to be the cheaper or more comfortable option.  I've done a lot of traveling.

I had to catch 3 buses to get into town, so it wasn't an option.  The light rail was due to go past my neighborhood in Morley, so it would have at least been a direct route into town. However, it would be as slow as a bus due to traffic lights everywhere. Labor's plan for trains on the Tonkin/Reid highway would have better."

Edit: downvotes incoming so I'll explain more. Perth sport teams are not owned by billionaires with deep pockets that can finance a new stadium, Nor do they have 50 million in revenue every year to pay it off either. The teams aren't threatening to leave or strong arming the government into doing things. It's the public that want the new stadium and it has public support."

In addition, there is a revenue base for the government - they will make money through ticket sales and food and drink.  Sure, they won't make a profit, which is why we cannot rely on private companies to build the stadium, but it's not like the money has no return.  Writing off all stadium development because some stadiums in the US have shitty contracts is silly.  Plus, sport and the ability to host other stadium events is a good thing for the economy, as well culturally.  Significant money is pumped into the economy when people go to events such as these (though the location is unfortunate as a lot of it will go to Burswood).  Also, plenty of things are funded by the government that are only used by a subset of the public - like museums and art galleries - which are still good things to have and that the government should help fund.  There's a reason cities in the US are desperate to attract NFL clubs - they're good for the city.  I would also note that memberships for both AFL clubs are currently sold out with a wait list - there is demand for this stadium."

Your point is generally fine, but you watched the video right?  Smaller cities are struggling to keep teams from leaving for the larger population centres because they can't make enough money.  They're leeches.  The flow on effects are myth and the construction arguments the worst sort of developer smoke blown to the back passage ""If you build expensive things, optimism and spirit rises and everyone gets more money, in ways no one can prove and certainly aren't in any way sustainable!  Development : you know it makes sense""  It's true it might not apply here though.  I certainly hope not.  Of all the various boondoggles in play I find the stadium to be more or less ok these days.  But I still find most of the arguments for it to be pretty hopeless ""Subiaco is old and yucky -harrumph-"" ""Everyone else has better ones! It's totes not fair!"".

That will surely come soon as they stick their hand out for money.  Both the WAFC and WACA should have been forced to co-build a new stadium if they wanted taxpayer money. If the MCG can handle 2 different codes, why do we have to duplicate a billion dollar stadium?"

If most people who live in Perth, or who visit the city on a regular basis, have experienced trouble at the hands of the people who are ""dark skinned"" then that is not being racist. It may be a prejudiced comment to assume they were, but people are entitled to form their opinions on their own life experiences.  I know that a strong majority of incidents I have witnessed or been involved in that are similar to this on (a small gang picking on/needlessly abusing/robbing/assaulting someone) have involved Aboriginal youths so like many other people, I am perfectly entitled to assume that this one was too."

All you do is place the blame on the colour of their skin, and not the fact that these kinds of people are made by culture how they are raised - Nurture vs Nature and all that stuff. It doesn't matter what race you are, it's about how you're fucking raised. To argue anything else is ignorant as shit, and you're kidding yourself if you think it's not racist bullshit.

I suggest that phrase was used in reference to descriptions now being ""dark/light skinned"" instead of Aboriginal or other, not saying all dark skinned people are criminals.  You've applied the wrong argument to the comment. It almost sounds like you would have preferred the comment to be ""Were they Aboriginal?"" which goes against all other PC rules we're supposed to live by."
perth,3d0186,Muzorra,-2,Mon Jul 13 05:23:27 2015 UTC,"I think you've misunderstood my argument a bit.

One of the ladies I worked with had to have a stack of stuff done - like almost $20ks worth as she'd neglected her mouth for years...  Her SIL recommended a surgeon in Thailand - she was gone for a week and the whole lot, including airfares set her back just under $6k  If you have a lot of work to do, no health insurance and some holidays built up, it can be a very good route to take.  Do your research and ask around. For under $2k you might as well just go local, but if you have a lot of work to do, its well worth considering."

I just googled it and found somewhere called the Bangkok international dentist centre.   I think the key is that you must avoid the cheap dentists in Thailand and go for the top of the line, which is still less than half the price of work in aust. The place I went certainly was.   I needed a fair bit of work and will need more; I will defintely return to Thailand when I can get some time off work.

The waiting times to see the GP's however can be ridiculous and most of the GP's there are very UNHELPFUL / completely useless at mental health issues (actually most of the GP's dont seem to give two shits about patient care in general)"

She's been really good. I've got something wrong with my brain/spinal cord at the moment, and they think it could be MS, but she's the only GP I've seen out of 3 who's actually given a fuck to even help manage pain in the slightest."

There are many other services that provide counselling whose fees are based on a sliding scale, but it really depends what your issue is generally?  Some organisations help better with specific issues better then others.  If you want to see a clinical psychologist, Medicare covers you for an amount (I can't remember how much it was, but it used to be $112.45), if the Psychologist is on the list who have a Medicare Provider Number.  Some psychs will bulk bill if you have a Centrelink concession card (if you are on a Mental Health Care Plan, which you get by visiting a GP)."

If you don't feel safe doing that, or if he's not cooperative, then call a community legal centre. I think throwing rocks and threatening people is unacceptable, and it could be illegal. CLCs are usually happy to advise on matters like these for free over the phone. Try calling Northern Suburbs Community Legal on 9440 1663 (Mirrabooka) or 9301 4413 (Joondalup).

Sometimes dogs get anxiety when the house is empty and go psycho and then act angelic and playful yaps on your return so you don't realise what the neighbours get pissed off about.

perth,3cs6gb,dojoca,10,Fri Jul 10 12:17:40 2015 UTC,He yells at any noise made. If the dogs make a short playful yap or if we make any noise outside. I recorded them (with sound) for a week. They're fine when we're out. They're starting to get very tense and will let out a warning bark at this guy now when they hear noise from that side since the rock throwing but it's not continuous.  I've spoken to the other neighbours and they didn't even know we had dogs.  He went off at my young nieces playing outside. They were just being kids and not being overly loud.

perth,3cs6gb,Geminii27,7,Fri Jul 10 14:56:30 2015 UTC,It sort of depends.  If he's complaining about noise in the afternoon then there's not a lot he can do about it and you can ignore him. Reasonable levels of noise are almost never illegal during normal daytime hours.  If on the other hand 'any noise' is loud music at one am and/or your dogs are barking all night long then I've got some news for you.  If that's the case you're the problem neighbour and you can get him to leave you alone by being less of a fuckwhit.
perth,3cs6gb,recycled_ideas,8,Fri Jul 10 11:39:39 2015 UTC,We never have music playing. Having a quiet conversation outside is enough to set him off. The dogs sleep inside at night and aren't problem barkers. We own the house and are starting to feel uncomfortable to be outside at any point.  If we're sitting outside and move a chair back and it scrapes the bricks loudly then off he goes!
perth,3cs6gb,gl0kta,8,Fri Jul 10 12:07:15 2015 UTC,Is he renting? Complain to the rental agency. Document his behaviour as evidence in case anything does happen.

We're not causing any problems here, we just want to be left alone to enjoy our house. We'd love to  invite friends over for a bbq at some point but we know he'd just scream over the fence"

Make sure to invite Mister Crankypants too, and let the neighbours who then hear him ranting away know that he was invited but didn't turn up. If nothing else, it'll get the neighbours on your side regarding him. If he starts screaming or throwing rocks during the BBQ, someone might even call the cops on him. If nothing else, it'd be an excuse to talk to some of your neighbours about what you could do about the issue, and ask if anyone knows anything about him."

The reddit demographic and the it's ok to be partying at 2 am on a weeknight demographic have a lot of crossover.  I'd recommend checking your local noise ordinances just to be certain you're in the right. If he's harassing you when you're doing the right thing call the cops. If he's threatening you, call the cops. If he's just giving you dirty looks and letters ignore him.  It's probably worth checking with other neighbours as well. If they're not bothered then that'll go a long way if he does report you and vice versa."

How difficult is it to become part of an agency? You do really have to put yourself out there. While at uni I sent my folio to agencies looking for an internship. Got a few offers and did that, which helped me get my first shitty job at a print company. Spent a year there, applied to a few more jobs (at this point it was a lot easier to get interviews)and got offered a couple of jobs. I took the current job I have because it was a pretty awesome deal. Are they (on average) great atmospheres? Is there a 'startup' feel? I can't speak for agencies. My work lets me pretty creative though.  Can I expect to be valued? You have to demand this from clients, explain why it is you are doing what you do, explain your ideas and how they can add value to your client's business. Once they understand you're the professional, it's a lot easier! As a designer:developer 70:30, am I any use? Am I in demand? Will I be able to build a career? Yes - you just have to really try. Do you have a website? Do you promote your work on communities like behance and dribbble etc? Do you have a printed portfolio? Do you have case studies in your portfolio explaining why you did what you did? Do you have business cards? Have you sent your portfolio off to businesses simply because you liked what they did, not because they had a job ad up? Also, you have to be good. Or at least understand what 'good' is if you're starting out. So many designers are terrible at kerning/leading/typesetting! Do you freelance on the side? A little bit, but I don't chase clients, they find me through friends. I work full time so I only have about 5 freelance clients atm What has the last 5 years been like for you? my first paid job was SHIT but it got me to where I am now which is good. I am looking to go into a more UX/UI orientated role next. What do you expect the next 5 years to be like for you? I either want to work in a more UX/UI based role or start my own business.

perth,3cmxau,CyanideRemark,2,Thu Jul 9 04:25:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah youre not wrong. Maybe the reason we say it exists at all is because the reason lies within a variety of reasons at similar times? As in- we dont particularly enjoy celebrities as much as our over the pond neighbours but we also celebrate different celebrities. Also, wouldnt celebrating someone for not being celebrate make them a celebrity? Maybe our view of high regard is significantly different when in contrast to someone.  Still interesting, and havent answered anything."
perth,3cmxau,sneakysnaker,2,Thu Jul 9 05:01:10 2015 UTC,"I guess too there's question of how different individuals in different fields; be it politics, sport, entertainment, science WOULD be celebrated and how different demographics chose to watch or partake - if at all - in that celebration. eg. Sports mad people not watching science shows. Science shows being relegated to off peak times and the like.  The likes of 'popular' scientists like Bill Nye & Neil deGrasse Tyson are big in certain contemporary social mediums (reddit, imgur etc) at the moment because of their prevalence in mainly US media. These scientist also have a bit of a talent for showmanship and presentation which ultimatley go towards furthering their cause amongst interested young viewers.  But surely this ignores the less charismatic, though in many cases a lot higher technically acheiving scientists."

Property and business owners do have the right to kick people off their property, the article isn't arguing that - it's arguing that the state government, or possibly the Department of Culture and Arts, or maybe even Duncan Ord, lacks compassion.  The question is though, is the state responsible for these people?  The state government has reduced funding and cut many mental health programs, housing affordability is out of control, a lot of places for the homeless to live are full and now the state government is kicking them out from underneath the stairwells they live under.  That strikes me as lacking compassion.  Also, the state government paid for this to be installed, how much help could they have given this person if they directed it to them, or programs that were meant to help them instead?

In this case they don't want to upset the taxi industry but then they don't want a voter backlash either. So, make out like you're doing something. Hire private investigators at public expense and announce you're going to have a green paper as soon as you can be bothered to convene a committee."

They may come, they may never come, but at least you know what they want you to improve. Without telling Uber exactly what the problem is, they're just burning money pointlessly.

Nobody is going to keep their taxi off the road for a month to avoid being checked, they'll go and make sure their vehicle is roadworthy (or pay the price if they're caught). Plus, once they coral the first few taxis, they'll be on the radio warning the others anyway.   the driver isn't the driver who applied to uber.   isn't that a contract issue with uber and the vehicle owner?

IMO it doesn't require spies to do it, nor would undercover inspectors be able to confirm if the person is in fact licensed. They can do it the same way they do it to taxi drivers, truck drivers, or even just regular drivers.   makes a performance for the media so that it looks like they are actually doing something,    That's really what it's about.

Perth Stadium broke ground in Dec 2014, so that put it ready between June 2017 to Dec 2017 based on the timelines I see with other stadiums. Maybe it will be ready by June 2017 (the video says end of 2017, making it 3 years which is not outside of the norm) but it still wont be used for the 2017 footy season. Only 2018. So it has up to 3.33333 years to be ready but it doesn't need to take that long, and isn't planned on taking that long.  edit: some info:  docklands (etihad) - October 1997 to March 2000 - 2.5 years  Sydney Olympic (stadium australia) - Sept 1996 to March 1999 - 2.6 yrs  Manchester (etihad) - Dec 1999 to Aug 2003 - 3.75 years (2.75 + approx extra year to fit football season)   Emirates Stadium (Arsenal) - Feb 2004 to July 2006 - 2.4 years  Wembley - Sept 2002 to March 2007 - 5.5 years  Olympic Park London - 2007 to 2011 (months not clear without further research) - 3 - 5 years.  3 years for Perth isnt too bad at all."

perth,3cdbng,MikeAppleTree,6,Tue Jul 7 12:01:59 2015 UTC,"There was an awful lot of pre-loading of the ground before starting actual construction. Before being a golf course, it was a tip, and before that I think it was a swamp. Not the best starting point, but also not typical ground conditions."

I don't think you'd have any issues assimilating. A basic job, providing you have the right to work, i'd say it's okay. You might get a large casual wage ($20/hr) here but costs will jump up too.   (6). I'd say so, you need to read people though. For example, an aboriginal yelling at people to fuck off out of his country is not someone you should approach.

James Squire 150 Lashes or Little Creatures Rogers are my personal favourites. Don't tell everyone that Australia does things wrong like drive on the wrong side etc etc. No one drinks Fosters here, it's shit.  As someone who is searching for a job right now it's tough, but I have seen plenty of barista openings throughout the city and Fremantle. Browse Seek.com.au, I could imagine something like $20 an hour as a barista. I make $18.11 an hour at McDonalds and I'm 18. From my experience in America, so speak slowly compared to us, so be prepare to be told you talk slow, but other than that it'll bring up a conversation and probably aid you. Everywhere is subject to crime, just don't leave your unlocked, or valuables in the open otherwise someone will probably take it. People are pretty friendly, I'm sure you'd be able to tell who is a dick and who isn't, don't look at people the wrong way and be friendly and 9/10 chance they'll be friendly."

There won't be too many culture shocks for you here other than the cost of living and Internet speeds.                I can't weigh in on beer options, but like others have mentioned just try em all.           Overall concensus of Americans is pretty good. I've met with no dramas.  Not too many social faux pas to look out for. There is going to be a bit of a language gap as you won't know the colloquialisms. Found out the hard way that ""rooting"" for some one does not have the same meaning here. But laughs will be had and seeing as your a pretty chill person, you'll laugh too.           Just like in the states, moving to a new city and finding a job takes a bit of luck. Hit the ground running by searching for work before you get here (someone else mentioned http://seek.com.au) and plan for the worst in case you don't find something immediately. Expect to make about 2-3 times what you were making in the US.                 My accent has been well received. Although people think I'm Canadian about 50% of the time. I have lived in Utah before (assuming that's where you're living) and your accent will probably fit into that ambiguous category as well.         I can't speak about Rivervale so you'll have to take others replies into consideration on that one.         Overall Perth people are nice, but not necessarily friendly. I found when I first moved here the best way to meet new people was to attend http://couchsurfing.com events.        Good luck on your travels.

Can't speak for the general public but most of the Americans I've met have been alright, just they need to stand a bit further back than they do. Haven't heard anyone slagging off Americans since the nineties/early-00's though, which bodes well for you. From what I hear you might have some trouble getting service work, but I've no first-hand experience with it. I've only done blue-collar stuff and that's pretty easy to get as long as someone vouches for you. Generally unless it's a stereotypically romantic accent like Italian or French, people won't comment (or even notice). Personally I can't stand most American accents, though there is a small place in my shrivelled heart for New Yorkers. Most folks will focus on what you're saying rather than how you happen to be saying it. Haven't been to Rivervale, but in general as long as you don't start shit with people and don't leave unguarded valuables around, you should be fine. Depends where you are, really. Most people are pretty chill and accepting, but you do get those who are a bit stuck up and cliquey, as I suppose you do everywhere."

I've found the public love Americans, we're a pretty welcoming bunch. I know quite a few from the US living over here and they love it.  3. You shouldn't have too much trouble getting a Barista role although unemployment is quite high here with the FIFO slump. Worst comes to worst could Uber drive for a while to make up for income. It is very expensive to live in Perth though, it's probably got the highest cost of living in Aus. So keep that in mind when looking for work.  4. I like a Boston accent if that says anything! I feel as though Aussies are used to the American accent because of TV.  5. I haven't spent a lot of time there so can't really help, I've found crime in Perth is quite high compared to other states but you figure out the danger zones pretty quick.  6.

Save your deposit now, go as high as you can go then when your income increases over time, start checking out your purchasing options.  But if you truly don't want to stay with your folks, then to be perfectly honest with you, you need to look elsewhere in the Metro area if you want cheaper but better quality rentals. Start checking out the real estate websites and pay attention to the maps. As a single person with no pets, real estate agents will love you.

But seriously, stay with your folks for ~1-2 years until you get that first decent pay bump whilst saving money. It will probably suck for that year and a bit but at the end of it you will have many more options than if you went into a shared house. On the downside it will suck, so you're really making a decision on what you want to do with your life."

If you save up a solid 50k you can probably push the repayments down to maybe 1700? Which really, isn't THAT much worse than rent. And at least you have an asset, at that point.  Also, if you're not above asking your parents for a hand out that works for a lot of people too.  Also remember your income won't stay at 50k for the entire 30 year mortage. It will be hard at first, for a few years maybe, but eventually you could buy a rental property and use the sweet negative gearing laws we've got to really build a stable portfolio.

Or you could look at other factors that might make 300/w more reasonable. Can you take the train to work? Maybe look for apartments near train stations on the same line. If you settle on a house near lots of amenities, you may not require a car at all. Do you have a gym membership? Some apartments have gyms built in that would mean you can cut your living costs. Just some ideas.  Or yes, just live with your parents if you can bear it."

perth,3c9r5x,TheraTears,15,Mon Jul 6 05:14:01 2015 UTC,"I live in an apartment and find it to be preferable to a house. Whilst I'd love a little more space it's not a huge drama, and I find the benefit of having less area to keep clean somewhat negates the lack of space anyway. The location, security and no worrying about maintaining gardens etc are big pluses for me.  Noise is definitely a potential issue. If you like playing loud music or cranking up the sub to watch World's Greatest Explosions XVII all the time, apartments are probably not for you, and you will find neighbours complaining. I generally do my best to have my neighbours not know that I exist, and I'm happy if they do the same in return.  Other people making tons of noise and annoying you is definitely a problem you can run into also - try to get a feel for the area,  visit the place you want to buy on a weekend evening if at all possible, and look for a newer place as it will tend to have better insulation (not always!). A piece of info that can be useful is whether your potential neighbours own their places or rent - if they rent and generate a bunch of complaints which make life difficult for their landlords, they probably won't be there long. If the neighbours own their places and are problematic, they might be around long-term. That can work the other way too, of course - if the neighbours are renting but fine, they might be gone in six months and be replaced by Mr and Mrs Bassface.  Make sure you find out what the strata fees are when looking at apartments, and consider what facilities you'd make use of. For example, I lived in a place with a pool for several years and never wanted to swim in it, but I still paid what amounted to a thousand dollars or so in maintenance for it over that time. On the other hand, my current place has a gym that I use semi-regularly, so maintenance is effectively subsidised by any other residents that never go in there."

Most people who live there are renters and therefore the tenants change, some are fantastic, others are horrible. But the good thing I suppose is that renters can get kicked out and so if you make a complaint against them they usually pipe down.   I hate travel time and so its something that I put up with as a trade off for living 5 minutes from work. I have to say its pretty awesome being able to wake up at 7:30 and be in at work by 8."
perth,3c9r5x,mrsummerlover,4,Mon Jul 6 06:10:51 2015 UTC,"I guess noise is a huge factor in apartments for most people, so I'll have to say avoid buying older apartments. Back in the day the BCA wasn't so fleshed out, so you get a lot of buildings that don't really do a good job of holding up.  Then look at the layouts. Try for back to back toilets/kitchens if possible, things like that to minimise the impact of sound.   Have a chat to your neighbours about noise before it becomes and issue. If it gets pushed to strata it can get messy and not so great for any of the parties involved.  Up-down impact sound might be an issue as the BCA's conditions aren't great (Lntw+Ctr of less than 62), but any GOOD firm is trying to push an Lntw of 55."
perth,3c9r5x,Comma20,3,Mon Jul 6 06:27:10 2015 UTC,"Yes there will be noise that you're not used to. Doors closing in other apartments or stairwells can make noise that carries through the building. Your upstairs neighbours sweeping their floors may make some noise every time their broom hits some furniture or a door.  A summary of a lot of the laws in the Strata Titles Act are basically you can't go around doing your own thing if its going to have an effect on the enjoyment of your neighbours. If you can't guarantee that you won't piss people off, apartment living isn't for you.  But there are things that people have to reasonably expect, and not make an issue out of every little thing. For instance, in my building, I can hear people's tv's blaring when I am in the lift lobbies. Technically, that is against the ""law"" but as I don't hang out in the lift lobby and I can't hear the noise inside my own place, then its not something I would make an issue out of.

perth,3c9a1u,OBNOXIOUSNAME,3,Mon Jul 6 06:48:39 2015 UTC,"to elaborate on this   It is therefore a very good idea, if such things worry you (as they should), to avoid all dealings with US companies where you are concerned about your privacy. To suggest that every US company may be complicit in handing every user’s personal information over to a secretive and largely unaccountable spying organization might sound the stuff of paranoid science fiction fantasy, but as recent events have proved, is terrifyingly close to the truth…  Note also that due to provisions in both the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), US companies must hand over user’s data even if that user is a non-US citizen, and the data has never been stored in the US.  In addition to this, the UK’s GHCQ is in bed with the NSA and carries out some particularly heinous spying projects of its own (‘They [GCHQ] are worse than the US’, Edward Snowden). Indeed, all members of the English speaking ‘Five Eyes‘ spying alliance (US,UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) share information between their security organizations and use each other to spy on their own citizens (to bypass national laws prohibiting this), and so companies based in these countries should also be similarity avoided."
perth,3c9a1u,Corrupttothethrones,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:59:15 2015 UTC,"If i use a US based endpoint then they(NSA) will keep logs of someone in there country accessing the sites but they cannot backtrace through the various servers as there is a large userbase coming from everywhere and all the data from the endpoint is encrypted.

perth,3c9a1u,xyrgh,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:39:32 2015 UTC,They are two different things entirely. Google the difference between them and you will see. Essentially when you connect to a VPN most things will slow down (including Netflix) but everything is encrypted. With the geo-unblocking services nothing is encrypted (unless the site is already https) and your internet speed isn't affected. All it does it makes the Netflix servers think that you are somewhere that you aren't (ie. USA/UK)  VPN will stop people from intercepting any of your traffic but you lose a bit of performance for that privilege.

Turns out it was for one of these marketing companies.  The first they had that I wasn't the person for the job was when I rocked up in a full suit with briefcase (usual interview materials inside).  The first clue I had was when they told me that they provide all the training you could ever need.  They offered to send me out with a couple of their sales guys so I could see the work - I should have nope-d out.  We drove out to Claremont. I kid you not, I spent three hours following these two young guy around knocking on doors asking for money for Oxfam (or something).  In between houses they would brag about how they tricked people into it and how easy it was to do. They made no sales.  At the end they didn't bother driving me back to Perth so I had to call my wife to pick me up.  While this work is for someone, it isn't for me.  I thought the agency and the individuals I worked with were dishonest in their dealings, and rely heavily on guilt.  Also, that rep makes money, the agency makes money, and finally the charity makes money, some of which goes to administration. So in the end, the charity doesn't receive anywhere near the amount of money you expect.  I do donate to charity - I donate to St Vincent de Paul - one collection per year, a HEAP of volunteer work, very professional internal organisation, extremely low administration.  I also give for ANZAC day and stuff.  Same deal - must be professional, must have low overheads, must be volunteers collecting.  Whenever I see professional people trying to sign up people for direct debit giving I ALWAYS ask them how much THEY make off the sign-up. I then ask them why I would donate if my first three months of payments goes into their pocket instead of the intended recipients."

perth,3c7odl,arkofjoy,2,Mon Jul 6 01:27:29 2015 UTC,"They do Tonkin Highway near me once every 12 months, usually about a week to clear rubbish and then another 1-2 weeks before it's collected.  Also, they just have to fil X amount of bags, so once the bags are full for a certain stretch, they are done. There is still a shit tonne of garbage cached up near the fences near where I live, probably enough to fill a few trailers."

perth,3c6klp,MikeAppleTree,6,Sun Jul 5 15:01:21 2015 UTC,Does it involve giving up on the whole celibacy thing and acknowledging that adult sexuality is a healthy part of the human condition?
perth,3c6klp,OptimalCynic,4,Sun Jul 5 10:40:05 2015 UTC,"Haha, imagine that, abandoning millenia of tradition just because it makes no damn sense. Next you'll be suggesting people with lady parts could be church leaders or priests. How crazy!?"
perth,3c6klp,beccaannw82,3,Sun Jul 5 13:18:23 2015 UTC,"The rate of paedophilia in celibate religious is LOWER than the general population. The issue is NOT celibacy - it is people abusing positions of trust.  It is interesting to note that even after a number of research papers into this, churches like the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and the Jehovah's Witnesses still perpetuate the myth that celibacy causes paedophiles.  Take this as an example - if you go a week or two without sex do you suddenly start finding children attractive? I seriously hope not."
perth,3c6klp,perthtemp69,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:18:50 2015 UTC,Do you have a study or something I could reference regarding the pedophilia rates? Not accusing you or disputing your claim just curious.
perth,3c6klp,LooseDuce,2,Mon Jul 6 10:33:04 2015 UTC,Johnson Report I think - google that and you'll get pretty close.
perth,3c6klp,perthtemp69,2,Mon Jul 6 10:57:59 2015 UTC,"So I found the report you were talking about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay_Report reading through in the summary of the finding it was noted that over the 50 year period and out of more than 100,000 priests ~4.4% had accusations of sexual abuse.     That sounded like a lot to me so I searched for a study on the general populace, this was harder but I found one study conducted in the Netherlands. I figure this is a first world developed nation as well so should be comparable. The study found 34 cases of sexual abuse per 1,000 children which works out to be ~3.4%.     While this is slightly lower given we're looking at different periods and different countries they're close enough to consider them equal for all intents and purposes.     So while it appears priests are no more likely to sexually abuse a child that the general populace, should we really be ok with this? I would believe that we should hold priests as they do hold a position of power to a higher standard than the general populace. Also we have the matter of the significant cover-ups conducted by the clergy in the past that gives the whole situation an 'icky' feel.     I have nothing against religions of any sort so please don't misunderstand my position as one of attack or vilification, it is up to the entire community both religious and not to find these sick individuals regardless of who they are or what they do an find them the help they need."
perth,3c6klp,LooseDuce,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:54:06 2015 UTC,The problem is not the comparison rates but the churches history of covering up. Im sure as shit a victim of it would not care about your statistics.
perth,3c6klp,smurphii,6,Tue Jul 7 07:53:05 2015 UTC,You're right and I agree.  I was responding to the FP who implied celibacy was the problem.  It isn't - it is the historical response of the Catholic Church.
perth,3c6klp,perthtemp69,3,Tue Jul 7 13:19:19 2015 UTC,"The fact that we need to have two ""guards"" per church to prevent pedophilia is just plain sad and disturbing....."

I don't need to be fucking comforted about the fact I'm gay, I just want to be treated equally as an Australian Citizen, I pay my taxes, I have to adhere to the same laws as you do - why should I be made to feel as less of a person because of something I literally have no control over?

perth,3c3khi,Whewt,5,Sat Jul 4 12:55:57 2015 UTC,I seem to recall something about white goods or something along those lines.

perth,3c3khi,Wang_Fister,4,Sun Jul 5 01:32:55 2015 UTC,"Due to the times Bunnings' stores are open, they are restricted in selling white goods etc in general. The only metro store that can sell these items is Armadale, I know there is at least 1 other but I'm not sure it's metro.   If you're after general home improvement supplies or tools, you should be fine any time they are open.  If you search for a product at http://bunnings.com.au after selecting your nearest store and a product you want comes up, it's available for purchase."

If you love A *mazing like anyone else who was alive in Perth in 1998, I would recommend checking out an American kid's game show from Nickelodeon called Legends of The Hidden Temple.

I couldn't stop laughing at this because I currently for work Universal/Sony promoting their DVDs at Kmart/Big W and I basically live in Como (Salter Point is literally right next to it) and the other guy who does this job around the South-East area actually lives in Laithlain. So I imagined we were both back in primary school at our respective locations battling head to head to win Gameboys and shit. I like to think I would win only because the other guy who does this job around this area is a lazy shit who wouldn't care to try hard enough.

perth,3c35w3,Captain_Poopy,9,Sat Jul 4 08:50:07 2015 UTC,"1.) Yes, depending on the ticket you've booked. You don't earn points on 'Economy Starter' or 'Business' fares, and the rest earn at a similar rate to their QF equivalents.  2.) Yes, but it's not straightforward. You'll need to register them for a Qantas Frequent Flyer account (click here to sign up and avoid the usual $90 fee), and then do a points transfer from their account to your own account once you return from your trip.  Hope this helps!"
perth,3c35w3,Whewt,2,Sat Jul 4 10:04:00 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks for your help.
perth,3c35w3,thommo101,3,Sat Jul 4 10:13:30 2015 UTC,"You get the option of upgrading the basic 'Starter' fare to the 'Plus Bundle' (which also gives you seat selection and $10 food credit, but no baggage). For Perth->Gold Coast that is about $50 per flight, per person, and according to their site will net you 2250 points and 35 status credits (each way).   You don't have to upgrade every passenger, so if you are the only frequent flyer in the family you can just upgrade yours. As for transferring points from the kids, the minimum amount to transfer is 5000 so you may be just under with the return leg (4500!)"

perth,3bz2bu,aussiekinga,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:26:31 2015 UTC,"fair enough. The thing is that with what's being talked about here, there's quite a lot that can be done in the background and the janitorial stuff tends to drop off after the filters get done correctly. Two would probably be overkill unless you want to start doing quality control and removing all the ""where can I buy/where can I find/what's the best place for"" posts - something we've discussed and rejected over the years."

Fuck they're annoying.   Also, some of us are blokettes.  I'm not interested in being a mod, but I thought I'd chime in anyway. I like this sub, but the trolls have been tiresome lately....  Also, the sub definitely needs tarting up a bit. Someone with CSS would be good.

I have noticed some things being done (posts removed etc) but other than those there hasn't been an actual 'presence' of the mods.   Personally I guess I would like to see more feedback/acknowledgement from the mods. So if someone contacts them even a reply from them to say ""we are dealing with it"" etc. Otherwise it sometimes feels like shouting into the void.  I also think the mods probably need to be involved in the community a bit, as 'normal' users, not mods. So be here and post in the discussions or something. It's not important for their function that they do that but it bridges the gap and makes them feel like people rather than a 'out there force that occasionally does stuff. Hopefully that makes some sense."
perth,3bz2bu,redheasidence,3,Sat Jul 4 01:38:51 2015 UTC,I would like to see at lease a couple of mods who are active in the community.

As I've said previously, running a great subreddit requires reddit to be (pretty much) your full time job, and unfortunately I already have a job and other commitments in my life.   I'd be interested in seeing the moderation log to see what actually got removed in the last month while you ""claimed"" to be working behind the scenes.  There's obviously been an issue for a while now, enough that two people have posted here complaining. At least 2 of us have put in /r/redditrequest 's to take over moderation. Oh and over a month ago of which none only one (not you) of the mods even replied or acknowledged the issues.  Really you and every other moderator should be logging in at least twice a week for 5 minutes to check the reports. If not, you should stand down and allow others to do it. I don't particularly care who, but the point of running the sub is to at least be there to run it when it's required.  There's my suggestions to make the sub less shit.  oh and direct anything that isn't directly related to perth to Aus. That sends all the politics and general shitposts there."

perth,3bz2bu,CyanideRemark,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:25:01 2015 UTC,greatt. It'd be cool if we had a Perth Reddit users meetup.
perth,3bz2bu,henry82,4,Mon Jul 6 15:58:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting, /u/Sagerian. I'm glad to know you're still alive, if nothing else. :-)  Firstly, hands off moderation is the same as no moderation. You're only safe for as long as the morons don't know where to find you.  My suggestions: - Kill off the trolls. Ackbar and his split personalities can be sorted in a few minutes with AutoMod and a karma barrier. Easy win. - Visible participation. /r/Perth is a shadow of what it could be, and certainly isn't helped by largely absent mods who have previously stated that they have better things to do. - Promotion of weekly discussions. Try and stay away from the political topics (because, let's face it, everyone in WA politics is an easy whipping boy at the moment), but stuff like this weeks fuckup or Perth bargain watch are good ways to make the sub amusing and worth visiting. Again, AutoMod can help out here.  I'm happy to throw my hat in the ring for mod work (though I'll freely admit that I suck at CSS and am dubious of its benefits on Reddit having seen some of the efforts in other subs). I was on staff at another large AU forum previously, have a reasonable amount of time free to monitor the queue and clear shit posting, and feel that I could guide this sub towards the place it should be (as part of a team), rather than where it currently is."
perth,3bz2bu,CyanideRemark,4,Fri Jul 3 15:35:46 2015 UTC,"Self moderation will continue to fail as long as multiple new accounts can keep spawning for peoples 'alter egos' and general shit posting.  I'm not really au fait on it completly, but /u/henry82 responded yesterday to a couple of my comments here about shadowbanning and some automated method of this where feedback continually below a defined threshold.  Even at the risk of a few false positives, this seems like an interesting idea if it keeps peoples acounts honest - or if at least soon be silenced if continually shit posting.  Hopefully henry82 will bob up again."
perth,3bz2bu,_cephei,8,Fri Jul 3 09:22:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, i posted my abuse above. Basically automod can remove people with less than a defined threshold of Karma. I'd recommend for /r/perth right now the threshold being 1. If the trolls fuck off and a tonne of new users get caught in the filter, then lower it to < 0. That would solve 90% of perths problems automagically."
perth,3bz2bu,_cephei,4,Fri Jul 3 10:19:34 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm reading so far, your opinion is the only one with a bit of practical and technical experience on the subject. Most other voices are just whinging."
perth,3bz2bu,durrymaster,3,Fri Jul 3 10:22:11 2015 UTC,"thanks. I've picked up quite a bit from running /r/sydney. Being a larger sub, problems occur more often and affect more people... we've been a bit more proactive about dealing with issues.  I don't even want to mod /r/perth... I just want this sub to be less shit."
perth,3bz2bu,fearofthesky,5,Fri Jul 3 10:37:32 2015 UTC,"It's a thankless job, I am sure. People not doing it are only too quick to whinge about the incumbent.  There's parallels with many other clubs & volunteer organisations as I'm finding myself.  I do believe the self-moderation theory can work better than it does - with a little automated help against karma as you've suggested which has been lacking here.  A little constructive criticism and actual insight of experience are refreshing."
perth,3bz2bu,koalanotbear,4,Fri Jul 3 10:45:24 2015 UTC,"I thought we had automod... when I made the post about the regular chat threads I mentioned having automod so I guess he got removed? It's not a hard bot to setup, it's easy to get it to post regular threads or even say we get the sidebar up to date if someone makes a thread saying 'I'm moving to Perth, help me out' the bot can comment and direct people to the post/wiki page/whatever that has tips about moving to Perth."
perth,3bz2bu,JollyOldBogan,5,Fri Jul 3 10:49:50 2015 UTC,Automod still exists. The difference is that it's built in to the site now so it doesn't show up as an account in the list of moderators.
perth,3bz2bu,KwinanaDogSpotter,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:42:55 2015 UTC,"Ah right, thanks for clearing that up"
perth,3bz2bu,JollyOldBogan,4,Sat Jul 4 01:37:03 2015 UTC,I feel we need more conversation threads and more community involvement from the mods to encourage more activity in this Sub-Reddit. Current system is working fine but with a more active Mod the community will be able to self-govern quite well and the trolls and shit-posts would soon fall away. Also a bit of work to the layout/flair design would be good for this mostly white sub-reddit.
perth,3bz2bu,aussiekinga,5,Fri Jul 3 10:33:28 2015 UTC,"Throw it all out and start again. All of the old usernames I used to see in here have been driven away by the toxic atmosphere created not only by trolls, but by a couple of total clown users who shit up the place with their idiocy on damn near every thread.   Get rid of the ""let the votes decide"" moderation style. It simply doesn't work in creating a good and fun community. Create rules and guidelines that must be followed and warn and ban if they are not.   I would make rules against all hate speech as that sort of things only creates an exclusionary atmosphere that is not good for a small community. The racism in this subreddits is incredible sometimes, and I'd like to see it removed completely. I'd also bring in a general ""keep it civil"" rule: no personally attacking other users, with encouragement to report such behaviour rather than engage against it. An environment where people can civilly disagree and not fear reprisals is conducive to discussion.  I'd also add way more than one moderator, because more than one would be needed to enforce these new rules. I think three to four more would be best."
perth,3bz2bu,koalanotbear,2,Fri Jul 3 09:15:32 2015 UTC,"This is the best comment in the thread, yet no upvotes, typical of r perth atm. Which is driving a lot of ppl out"

perth,3bz2bu,fearofthesky,3,Fri Jul 3 16:57:29 2015 UTC,"Generally I think the self regulating works okay, with one exception. I would like a rule that when someone is at -60 karma (or something like that) there posts are automatically deleted. That way we don't have to repeatedly deal with the same trolls. Given a dozen sit posts from them they shall be automoded away.  I do like the idea of some regular sticky posts. Set up the automod to pay something every Monday or something. Small question that don't deserve their own post."

perth,3bz2bu,koalanotbear,3,Fri Jul 3 11:18:42 2015 UTC,"Hi All. The existing mods have added me to the mod list for Perth. So welcome to my reign of terror. (I guess I should probably at least wait until a sufficient trial period has passed and I have lulled the previous mods into a false sense so security before bringing the terror, so maybe we raincheck it for now).  So here is what I am thinking in terms of what I will and will not be doing:  I plan on employing a very light touch. I'm here very regularly (and at all hours, having a newborn that wakes me at silly times, so I sit at the computer while feeding) so I plan on reacting to trolling and abuse reports fairly quickly. So keep reporting what you see. Also shall make an effort to reply to mod mail if other things are raised through it.  I believe herp has also added some rules with the automod to also help weed out trolls, so that should help.   I don't plan on adding any other mods, I shall leave that to the existing mods to do as they see fit. And I don't plan on adding any rules etc right now.  I do not know CSS, but shall be interested (in time, not immediately) in updating the sidebar and a few other things. I do know some programming (although haven't used it in years) so might be able to muddle through. I might ask people for help with it, a few here have said they were willing.  Always happy to take feedback and suggestions.  So hopefully y'all are happy with my addition. I shall try not to disappoint."
perth,3bz2bu,KwinanaDogSpotter,6,Sat Jul 4 09:31:18 2015 UTC,"So basically right now we are just going to have another mod but the only difference is they will be active to ban users.... which yes is what mostly sparked the discussion for needing active mods but still, a lot of people have been in agreement with having more activity which cannot be done without mod access (sticky threads etc).  Even /u/Sagerian posted 2 months ago asking for people to volunteer to rehaul the sidebar and people offered but that was never followed up on. It was then bought up again here and ideas were thrown around but obviously without any mods around nothing further happened.   Anyway welcome."
perth,3bz2bu,henry82,2,Sat Jul 4 14:02:33 2015 UTC,"The biggest rated response here is that the site is working fine as is but needs mods to kill trolls quicker. That is by far the most upvoted and thus what the people want. So that's what I'm working to first and foremost.  Next, I'd you look at the sticky list suggestions that were up voted it was actually my suggestion. That will get implemented. Why would I ignore my own suggestion when it was liked?  Finally, I said I would look at the sidebar depending on my availability. I cannot speak to the request a few months ago as I had nothing to do with it."
perth,3bz2bu,KwinanaDogSpotter,0,Sat Jul 4 23:47:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't really expect to be modded with my total polar opposite suggestions (more rules, no racism period, strong banhammer on dickheads). I guess Perth the subreddit (like Perth the city) is very good at maintaining the status quo.  Ha, that sounds really bitter, but I'm not really. Good luck mate, thanks for being one of the good ones."
perth,3bz2bu,Skeetzor,0,Sat Jul 4 09:54:40 2015 UTC,"I get the whole ""no racism"" thing, but I look at that as more just making the place a white washed tomb. Clean on the outside but foul inside. In some ways I think it is better to have people actually say their racist shit and have people call them out on it. And I think people are called out on it regularly (and if you see people making racist comments call them out and provided you aren't equally a jerk in how you do it then I shall be upvoting you)"
perth,3bz2bu,KwinanaDogSpotter,3,Sat Jul 4 09:59:27 2015 UTC,I get what you're saying but most often I see the racist comments upvoted and anyone calling them out downvoted. That's why I stopped becoming a regular here; it was making me hate Perth more than I already did.   I hang more now that I no longer live in Perth because it's good to keep up with happenings. I might just avoid any thread about Aboriginals.

I think some posts are ok but theres been comments regarding glue sniffing and centrelink that really should be completely banned imo. There are more ppl here that upvote those comments than those that dont, only because those have driven everyone else out. And they are exactly the people that the subreddit needs to attract to gain activity. Nobody posting about events that are happening, club nights, gigs etc, because the people going out to them are avoiding this subreddit.

If you have been following the who victoria firing/AMA/blackout thing the last few days has been about the disconnect between admin and the mods because there is no two way communication (other than with victoria whom was just fired). Mods shut things down because they didnt feel that admin 'got' the community or interacted enough with it to adequately service it.   I think the feeling here is similar, that the mods are disconnected from the community and don't ""get it"". Their active involvement here, joining in with discussion, would alleviate that."

First, to the mods of r/perth thank you. I know it's a difficult, thankless job that is only visible when it doesn't happen.   Second I don't think that there is a problem with more mods. More voices means a better consensus. It means less stress as the burden of moderation falls on on a broader group of people.  As to moderation, I'm a less is more sort of guy but that's just me. I realise that most people want more so that's cool too. Karmabot sounds a great way of separating out the big picture stuff and allowing the mods to judge the fine line things.  A weekly (bi-weekly) auto post is a brilliant idea (imho). It breaks the ice for discussion and keeps the reddit ticking over. A Sunday post so people can mention what's happening if anything over the coming week and a Friday post to discuss the past week maybe.   That's all I've got atm. Enjoy the rain. ;/"

perth,3by5gt,showmanic,5,Fri Jul 3 05:15:10 2015 UTC,"I think you're being a little dramatic there. My understanding of the ""Where's my share?"" way of thinking is that it relates to work.  Somewhere like Canada has a minimum requirement of labour and materials etc that must be sourced locally.  WA does not, we have piss-weak ""recommended"" and ""suggested"" levels of Australian participation which are not at all enforced.   And thus, billions of dollars worth of work has been sent overseas and lined the pockets of people on the other side of the world. Hence the mass protests against the likes of Chevron etc.  Opportunities that won't all be recreated have been missed, and people are rightfully pissed off."
perth,3by5gt,Whewt,3,Fri Jul 3 05:46:12 2015 UTC,"Hence the mass protests against the likes of Chevron etc.   ..which are potentially misdirected. There's large resources companies up and down the terrace - Chevron included - that have local content clauses in their contracts or procurement guidelines. Just because it's not law from the government, doesn't mean that business isn't trying to source staff and materials locally in preference to elsewhere.  A number of contracts I've seen from various companies are heavily biased towards WA content, with Australian-based being second preferred and international sourcing being the last resort. Provided that local suppliers aren't taking the piss to an extortionate level, the business will remain in Australia."

It most often does. It is usually cheaper and easier (in regards to regulations and so forth) to outsource certain work, if a minimum level isn't enforced it makes no economic sense for the company to try and meet it. There's no expectation of altruism, here. They are running a business and will exercise whatever options are available to them.  I used to work for Chevron and I can assure you that the Australian Industry Participation program is primarily a PR exercise, they add these clauses and guidelines you speak of to cover their asses when they are accused of what I'm accusing them of now, however they are exactly that - guidelines with no consequences for failing to meet them. When I was there, the targets for % of AIP (Aus industry participation) initially set were so far from being met, they were greatly reduced and I'm fairly sure even then they still haven't been met.  I think it was the British Columbia province in Canada I was reading about which explained how this can be done right, done in an economically-sustainable manner and the benefits of it.

But on your comment, there was plenty of opportunity that stemmed from the last decade of boom times. Not necessarily related to the mining and construction industry, but the opportunities that a growing population and economy provided.

Of course reason needs to factor into it e.g. the WA steel fabrication industry obviously won't be able to cope with the demand so that sort of thing needs to be outsourced, but we have a situation where hundreds of engineers and designers are out of work while our major projects are being designed offshore in offices in London, Paris, Houston etc and THAT is not right.

perth,3bu03h,j_ee_p,-13,Thu Jul 2 08:31:27 2015 UTC,"It's disgusting what the police and Government is doing to them, no different to us, they want justice, why isn't it being given? We just sweep it under the rug, mine their land and give no money to them, disrespectful towards their culture, and most yobbos just scream ""coons"", but then they say their not racists...white entitled Aussies are pathetic and I'm one of them."

You want to be friends with the lazy buggers go ahead. There are productive, healthy and civilised aboriginals all over the place. These dirty animals camping on the island, and others like them, are bringing the rest down and don't deserve your respect. They deserve pity and should be kicked off the island."

Hence why they continue to be moved off the island.  Whether the land is used for its purpose or not they are still breaking the law.  If anything there has possibly been some lenience shown to them given the sensitivity of the matter.  The closure of the aboriginal communities is unfortunate, however from my understanding they aren't being forced to leave, rather services are no longer going to be supplied.  One could suggest, that they would be able to live off the land in these communities without these services, as they had done previously throughout history.  However, the removal of what is essentially a basic human right is quite disappointing, especially given the relatively minor cost to the State.  Anyways I've been drinking and rambling."

So yeah, don't worry, we have just created this system, people depend on, health wise indigenous people have taken swimmingly to our foods and minimalist culture... but yeah go off and live off the land like outcasts    been drinking and rambling.

There's no need to go on the offensive.  While I agree with what you are saying, your two points seem to contradict one another.  On one hand you say they shouldn't have to adopt our laws, but you also say they shouldn't have to live like outcasts.  Unfortunately, you can't have both.  They can either enjoy the services that the State provides and abide by the ""white law"" as you put it, or they can live like outcasts and disregard our laws completely.

perth,3bttxc,metao,11,Thu Jul 2 02:38:39 2015 UTC,"How about just not breaking the law in the first place? Why drive around having to worry where a speed camera might or might not be? There's speed limits for a very good reason. Your car has a speedometer for a very good reason too.  Make sure that the speedo on the inside of your car either is less, or matches those big signs with the number in a circle on the side of the road and then there will be no need to worry where the speed cameras might or might not be.  Pretty simple stuff isn't it?"
perth,3bttxc,CranberryPancakes1,3,Thu Jul 2 02:41:41 2015 UTC,"I've tried telling other people this and you won't believe the uproar.  Most people drive fairly recent cars and most of those cars have cruise control.  Most people have smart phones that can download a reasonably accurate speedometer app.  Use the app to double check your speedo, and set your cruise control accordingly.  Speeding fines start at 5km/h over the limit, set your cruise to 3km/h over MAX and you'll be faster than everyone on Perth roads and never get a fine.   Source: have been driving this way since I got cruise control, never had a speeding fine and have driven through speed cameras repeatedly."

perth,3bttxc,obzelite2point0,5,Thu Jul 2 05:22:49 2015 UTC,"It's more to do with the enforcement side of the equation. It counters the criticism that the cameras are opportunistic revenue raisers. The idea is, you know where they are so there's doubly no excuse – don't try to weasel out by claiming you're the victim. I'm not aware of evidence that people can speed through detours as a consequence (but then again I don't read the tabloids) – I expect the govt would mitigate that kind of thing, often by ensuring every road is narrowed to one lane due to never-ending construction ;) There's also a safety argument: it means more people will drive within the speed limit, thereby preventing speeding rather than just punishing it afterwards (but this only works if people check beforehand). That's also a reason why more locations are advertised than the actual number of cameras we have."

I live pretty much around the corner from there so it's my go to when I don't want to cook, but the food doesn't have real Italian flavour.

It has an ambience of restrained terror which truly compliments the rustic cuisine and fat-fried gristle on offer.  It will also offer you the opportunity to mix and mingle with local indigenous folk who will charm you with their dreamtime stories, threaten to stab you in the eyes or, if you're really lucky, vomit onto you, which is regarded as a symbol of good luck.  Entertainment is also provided by local bogans, some whom have travelled from as far afield as Armadale or Kelmscott, and who will demonstrate their martial art skills by kicking the crap out of some unconscious wino they have found laying on the pavement outside.

If you're looking for hiking, I recommend 60 Foot Falls in Ellis Brook Valley, or Bell's Rapids in Brigadoon. Both of which have rivers/falls that flow heartily with all of the rainfall. I can provide pictures of both of these places when I get back if you'd like, otherwise you can just Google either.  EDIT: Oh and just incase you're not from Aus, I should point out that if you go hiking, you will see kangaroos. Under no circumstances should you approach them though as they can be aggressive, and they're very capable of doing a lot of harm."

Not Aboriginal natives - this was a group formed in the last part of the 19th century to promote the interests of Australian-born whites as opposed to immigrant whites.  More recently, this location was a dental centre, presumably one of the Australian Unity chain (which is what the ANA turned into). It doesn't appear to be listed under AU locations according to their website, so it may have gone independent (or been abandoned; I haven't visited the area personally in some time)."
perth,3bqbcx,Geminii27,2,Wed Jul 1 11:56:07 2015 UTC,"Australian Natives' Association:       The Australian Natives' Association (ANA), a mutual society was founded in Melbourne, Australia in April 1871 as the Victorian Natives' Association.  In 1872 it voted to extend membership to men born in the other Australian colonies and changed its name at the same time.   The Association played a leading role in the movement for Australian federation in the last 20 years of the 19th century. In 1900 it had a membership of 17,000, mainly in Victoria.  The ANA provided sickness, medical and funeral cover. Membership in the ANA was restricted to men born in Australia, at a time when Australian-born people of European descent (not including Indigenous Australians) were rising to power in place of an older generation born in Britain. In the 1890s, for the first time, they became the majority of the population. The ANA consisted mainly of energetic middle-class men aged under 50 - a perfect base for a forward-looking, idealistic movement such as federation. In 1880 the ANA committed itself to the federation of the Australian colonies, and provided much of the organisational and financial support for the Federation Leagues which led the campaign, particularly in Victoria. It avoided party politics, but they soon adopted the rising liberal politician and ANA member Alfred Deakin as their candidate for leadership of the federal movement.

perth,3bm1zx,impossible_planet,3,Tue Jun 30 09:22:44 2015 UTC,"Cheers! I'll setup my camera always at 100ISO and then aperture above f8, what aperture I use depends on what it takes to achieve a 3 minute photo. Usually around 1/10th. But this is the first time I've done a 30min photo as it headed from sunset to darkness.  I use a 10 stop ND filter along with graduated ND filters to allow the sky to be the same exposure as the foreground. These are square or rectangular glass or plastic.  Then I'll use mirror lockup, tripod and cable release to make sure there are zero vibrations while taking this photo, as a slight move or vibration over the 30mins will wreck the whole image.  I hope this helps a little."
perth,3bm1zx,uildaan,2,Tue Jun 30 14:06:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That was very helpful, appreciate it. Probably won't try a 30min exposure just yet but I'll try your settings for 1-3min exposures for sure."
perth,3bm1zx,murrayhenson,2,Tue Jun 30 15:55:47 2015 UTC,Yea 1-3 mins is a good length for long exposures.  I don't recommend 30min exposures as the sensor heats up and creates a lot of noise which will take forever to remove in post.   If you need any more tips or help let me know and I'll try point you in the right direction.
perth,3bm1zx,boredaustralian,2,Tue Jun 30 16:03:37 2015 UTC,So are you removing boats etc post processing or do they just become irrelevant due to the length of exposure?
perth,3bm1zx,Elijah6053,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:47:05 2015 UTC,"There were no boats in the shot when I was down. I think they were further to the left of the image.

perth,3blz85,tatty000,7,Tue Jun 30 09:28:18 2015 UTC,"""Now people have invested in taxi plates so we are not about to destroy their wealth but at the same time having high cost of entry is not sensible for the industry into the long term.  But Mr Barnett again ruled out compensation for taxi plate holders if the industry was deregulated.   You'd be really bloody shitty to pay $500k for plates, then be told ""oh yeah in a few years they're worth a tenth of that"". I dunno what the answer is, but shafting all the cabbies seems like a poor idea.  Unless the plates are by-and-large owned by investors, not drivers.  Investors should have a wide range of investments, shafting cabbies (with one source of income) isn't right.  I'd go back to taxis if Swan Taxis didn't have such shitty services (app/phone line).  Uber's app is sleek.  They tell you exactly what, where and how long your car will be.  With your driver's name.  Then it tells you when they're close.  I've not had much success with Swan Taxi's app, and the call line isn't much good either.    If I'm getting a taxi I'm probably drunk, I don't want to be stuck on hold for ages, or have to leave the pub/party before I have to."
perth,3blz85,madmooseman,5,Tue Jun 30 08:54:05 2015 UTC,I don't know why someone would pay up to half a million dollars to drive a fucking taxi. Is the pay really that good?
perth,3blz85,eateggs,3,Tue Jun 30 09:30:50 2015 UTC,They bought the plates as an investment thinking their value will go up. Unfortunately they are about to learn that all investments have risk. Although the taxi lobby is pretty powerful so it sounds like they are going to be bailed out somewhat.
perth,3blz85,random555,5,Tue Jun 30 21:22:27 2015 UTC,"Doubt it, but I'm also pretty sure you can resell the plates later."
perth,3blz85,madmooseman,3,Tue Jun 30 09:40:33 2015 UTC,I doubt most owners would own the plates for what they're driving. Mostly bought by investors and managed by whichever company (Swan Taxis being pretty much the only option in Perth)
perth,3blz85,The_Valar,2,Tue Jun 30 10:29:21 2015 UTC,"from the people i have spoken to, not many drivers own their own plates. i did a whole bunch of rear window stickers for cabs, the guy who got them owned 10 plates, he never drove, just sat back and raked in the money while his cabs ran 24/7. drivers had to buy their own fuel, but paid him a % of each shift, and a minimum if they didnt get enough rides. pretty sure this wasn't how the industry was meant to be run. also seems that people with similar ethics have moved into uber, gf got a uber to my place a few weeks ago after a night out with girls, guy had no idea where he was going. his gps was flat, he didn't know how to use the gps on his phone that was also close to flat and he had no chargers for anything, he hardly spoke any English and he had no idea how to operate anything in the car he was driving. couldn't operate the heater or demister, drove along tonkin with front windscreen completely fogged, missed the turnoff to my place and ended up in kelmscott when im in southern river. uber was less than helpful and didnt want to know about the potential of someone using another persons uber account, and refunded part of the fair due to doing a scenic tour. swan taxis do suck, but if the same people decide to switch to uber then thats going to end up fucked as well."

Aside from all the bullshit of plate hoarding investors vs. actual drivers and the onselling of the plates at ridiculous prices I'm now reading;  are the plates just purely a rubber stamp permit thing?  Are their rules about the delegation and who actually can drive?  This seems to be a common concern about the quality and vetting of drivers from either side. Sleazy and dodgy driver stories seem all the more prevalent under the traditional system; however bloated and bastardised the plate system is.  trad Drivers have some sort or permit or license don't they, seperate to whoever actually owns the car & plates?"
perth,3blz85,CyanideRemark,2,Wed Jul 1 02:47:21 2015 UTC,Depends if the govt charged the investors the $500k to buy the plates or it was due to investors bidding up the price when buying from other investors.
perth,3blz85,aussielander,2,Tue Jun 30 09:17:02 2015 UTC,"So what was it; limited number of plates available from the Govt, and then speculators/investors on sold them to others at some point?

perth,3blz85,CyanideRemark,6,Tue Jun 30 10:22:46 2015 UTC,"The buyers of these plates brought something from other investors that had no guarantee from the govt, accordingly I dont see why they should get any sort of compensation."

My issue with both these changes is that they actually put a much higher requirement on merging courtesy (requiring other drivers to slow to let you in, and requiring drivers to not change to the empty exit lane to skip 500m of traffic before attempting to merge back onto the continuing lanes right as the lane exits).  I would expect this to actually result in a worse merging experience, rather than positive behaviour change."

No a link (sorry) but from my work doing some traffic engineering the basic thought here (I assume) is that it shall prioritise the freeway traffic over the ramp traffic. Zipper merge is more egalitarian, while the left lane gives way merge favours movements in the right lane.   Thus similar to how ramp metering works by limiting ramp entry to allow for better flow on the freeway, this line marking is supposed to allow better freeway movement while the ramps pay for it.  Not sure it will work that well and ramp metering would be a much better idea. But it costs a lot more."

That ramp is so close to the next exit that you get a lot of weaving movements. It is also too short to do effective ramp metering on. What would probably work on it is actually lower mainline speed limits (likely variable speed limits so that it could be raised during low demand periods) but then it relies on people actually obeying the speed limit and understanding that in some cases lower speed limits actually prevent flow breakdown and thus will get you there quicker.

The two brightest planets in the sky, Jupiter and Venus, have been putting on a nice display as they have been steadily drawing together. But now it gets better.  Over the next few days the crescent Moon joins the pair, most spectacularly on the 20th when the Moon, Jupiter and Venus form a triangle, but the days after still pretty good as the Moon, Jupiter Venus and Regulus form a line.

Great stuff if you're eligible for it.  The rest = There's a cafe in NY run by Australians, serving Australian-style food and coffee (zomg Flat Whites!). There's a pub in NY run by Australians, pumping out Aussie beer and live AFL. There's a 17 year old from Bundaberg in NY, who's got accepted to study at a prestigious ballerina academy (kudos to her). There's 20,000-ish Aussies in NY. It's a concrete jungle.

perth,3bdqcy,fermilevel,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:28:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that. It turns out the ""naked cable"" with 100GB costs $50 if you have a phone line with them, or $80 if you don't. A bundle costs $74, so it's cheaper to have a phone than not.   Looks like I'm going to wait until tomorrow when they release their new plans. Telstra Air will be a feature.  Connection is supposedly $169, whether it's an easy install or not."

Pretty sure you can't get a subcrontractor to do this, no reason to really it's all included in the price...The only reason you may have a problem is if the conduit is too small to take the cable or has been damaged and they cant pull it through.  Then you will have to pay extra.    Cable is so awesome compared to ADSL, its worth sucking telstra dick, it's gone down once in the 2 years I have had it, and that is the only time I have called support.  It does seem to be a bit slower lately,but still shits over my 1.2mbs ADSL,  I may upgrade to 100mbs"

perth,3bdqcy,6000_asshole,6,Tue Jun 30 02:04:34 2015 UTC,I have Telstra cable. I had to have a technician come around and find where the cable ended in my house and pull it through the wall/ put a connection on it. Cost about $300 iirc just for that. So I can't imagine a new connection being cheap.  Getting bent over by Telstra is worth it for cable though.
perth,3bdqcy,henry82,3,Sun Jun 28 08:35:00 2015 UTC,Could be cheaper to get foxtel installed and have that for a month. I think the max connection fee for that is $150

perth,3bdqcy,ProfSmiles,3,Sun Jun 28 10:44:28 2015 UTC,"From memory it's included in the installation price. They offset it by having shit internet plans that cost too much.

perth,3bdqcy,eateggs,5,Sun Jun 28 06:46:58 2015 UTC,"You're thinking of a different type of install, i.e modem setup. I think OP is talking about running a new cable to his premises which I believe would be a separate cost     You can also sign up with cable alone or a bundle. I got a bundle phone + cable for $85 which is not a bad deal for 500gb and 35mbps down speed."
perth,3bdqcy,6000_asshole,4,Sun Jun 28 08:25:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's naked cable. Telstra doesn't advertise it, because they want you to bundle it with a phone line. If you search their product disclosure pages, it' there.   About $55 for 100Gb. Cheaper than ADSL with an unused phone line."

If she had spare time she'd dust or clean windows. That was three hours and it stopped the insanity from building up  I'd be wary of paying someone less than $20 or $25 an hour.

We have ""cafe strips"" which are literally a section of road lined with cafes. In Freo its south terrace, Leederville the end of Oxford st nearest the train line, West Perth has a nest of little alleys along Wolf Lane with tiny bars in it; Northbridge is James st and William st Mt Lawley is Walcott & Beaufort st intersection.  The Chinatown is at the top of William st above Northbridge (going North)  Kings Park is well worth a look and does indigenous tours by greg Nannup if you'd like the aboriginal history.   Kite surfing and wind surfing at Scarborough beach and sometimes Trigg - you can hire boards.   The beaches are all lovely. Cottesloe is well worth a visit - its very ""seasidey"" and has numerous bars and cafes overlooking the sea.   Rottnest is worth a visit, as is Margaret River, if you can go that far.   If you hang out in a cafe on James st on a Friday or Saturday night, there will be enough trollops dressed in teensy skirts to keep the whole US Navy happy. If you prefer a classier look and have money to burn, the Stables will get you a much better class of trollop :)  If you prefer your trollops male, The Court hotel will see you right.

Tesla has had a handful of deaths from the model S, each scrutinised vastly more than other events, but its still widely regarded as safer than many other cars.

When you've got a screamer, like the youngest two I look after (twins, so they fuel each other), you just have to persist. Sometimes it takes half an hour to get them to quieten down. Stick a dummy in their mouth, sing to them, give them something to suck on - there's heaps of ways to do it.   When I'm at home with them, I just ignore them and they realise pretty quickly that what they're doing isn't working and they go quiet pretty fast.

Dunno bout the second one. You can't explain shit to a kid that young. My brother used to deliberately avoid restaurants and shit when he had kids that young for exactly that reason.

If you're getting photos or autographs, be aware that the line to purchase tokens will be long, and so will the lines for the photos and autographs themselves - especially for the most popular/top billed people.  Lines for panels will also be long, but anything happening in the Cosplay Theatre should at least have seats available (albeit possibly quite far back) no matter how late you show up, because it's a huge space. Supanova haven't used it before and there have been many times where panels became standing room only or even full to capacity, but Oz Comic Con have used it a few times and there's always been tons of space.  Getting cash beforehand (somewhere not at/near the venue) is a great plan, because there are ALWAYS gigantic ATM lines and often ATMs that run out of money altogether. I'd expect most of the bigger vendors (and the Supanova token store) to be able to do payment via card now, but I don't know if the small 1-2 person stalls are likely to offer that, so cash can still be useful."

As has been pointed out already, it does get pretty crowded so expect to stand in lines for a while. Photos/autographs can be pretty expensive and they have the longest of lines.  If you have things you really want to buy in mind, get them first. There are lots of things around that will tempt you to buy other things. Also food is expensive so bring your own if you can. Alternatively you could walk to a food place and buy there which is what I do.  If you want to get a photo of someone in cosplay, feel free to ask. I often cosplay and feel more than happy to take a photo with someone if they want. Just be aware that some people are more shy than others.  Last thing I can suggest is to make sure you check out what's on. The panels and shows can be pretty good even if they don't sound the most interesting.    Hope you enjoy your day!"

Just avoid being an idiot and it's like any other place in the city at night time.  The Armadale line is seedy however. Ironically I'm posting this as I'm while I'm at Beckenham train station."

(im asian you can't call me racist kappa)  Caversham wildlife park is nice if you wanna touch koalas and wombats or milk a cow.

We have a fake rivalry going on between the suburbs north of river (rich bogan wankers) and south of the river (poor bogan scum)... but really it's all the same shit.  We like to whinge a lot.  If you've got a day or more off, don't spend it in Perth. Visit the Swan Valley or Margaret River wine/beer region. We've got some beautiful countryside but you need to drive at least 2 hrs to get there.   edit: The Armadale train line is the dodgiest, with the most muggings and general crime and human stinkiness. All the others are not too bad, even late at night. Also, the buses are sometimes unreliable (+/-0 to 15min), but aside from meteor strikes and flooding, not much makes the trains run late.  Once the weather is a bit warmer, spend a day at Rottnest Island... or hell do it now if you can stand the cold, just make sure it's more than 4 days after the last rain so the water is nice and clear.

Northbridge can sometimes be a bit hit or miss. Yes, it is seedy as fuck and definitely not where I'd wanna be on a Saturday night but during the day, it's much quieter and safer to walk around. Plus because the majority of nightclubs/live venues in Perth are all in Northbridge, it's more than likely you'll end up there at some point. Just try not to travel alone and keep watch of your belongings and you should be fine. There's always tons of extra police on weekends in Northbridge to combat all the anti-socialism that happens in that area.    Apparently there's an amusement park somewhere   Adventure World in Bibra Lake on Progress Drive. Bit expensive but highly recommended. Easiest way to get there from Cannington is to go down Leach Highway, turn at Karel Avenue and then turn down Farrington Road and then onto Progress Drive just before you get to North Lake Road. I haven't been to Adventure World for a few years and I think the season has closed for this year and will reopen in September but I definitely recommend checking it out.    King's Park has swans and a good view though I have no idea where it is   Literally right next to Perth on Mounts Bay Road before Crawley/Nedlands/UWA   The Armadale train line is full of dodgy people   Yep, as the old saying goes ""Some people call it Armadale train station, others call it home"". To be honest though, Armadale isn't THAT bad. I work in Armadale 1-2 days a week and I quite like the people around there, they're all very friendly and geniuine characters. You still get a fair amount of dodgy shit happening but there's plenty of other places in Perth that are much worse. The only problem with Armadale is that because it's basically the fag end of Perth before you get to the country, you feel like you're so much further out than usual.   Lots of people say they live in ""the hills"" but they all seem to mean somewhere different   The Hills refers to the area past Midland encompassing suburbs like Greenmount, Mundaring, Helena Valley, Darlington, et al, so called because all the houses are built on gigantic hills. You get incredible views of the city from The Hills and the houses are expensive as fuck but it's much further out than the rest of Perth so keep that in mind if you ever want to move there.    Sydney people are generally disliked (though I haven't encountered this, unless it's only going on behind my back :p)   I have no opinion on this. I've been to Adelaide and Melbourne and I'll probably get downvoted for saying this but I much prefer the people in those two states to the people in Perth. Melbourne people are especially awesome."

Adventure world, the amusement park you mentioned is not worth it in my opinion. If you've been to the gold coast, or anything in America, you'll be standing there thinking wtf did I pay for?   As others have said a trip to rottnest can be nice. Preferably in summer time.   If you're after an area open in the evenings that's not freo check out either Victoria Park or Mt Lawley.   Kings park is a nice spot as well, it's that large forresty area on the hill right next to the city.  If nature things and walking around are your style I'd say check out John Forrest national park which is up the great eastern highway.   For a weekend away I'd suggest the south west, Albany and Margaret River would be my top picks. Come summer time I'd add Esperence to the list - absolutely killer beaches.   If history is your thing there's a lot of nice historic towns just over the hills, York for example.  As others have said, avoid driving any time moisture may be falling from the heavens. We do not know how to deal with rain in Perth . Also the first rains after a while are extra shitty because all the grease on the roads causes the big idiots to crash every time always."

Northbridge is perfectly safe though it gets a bit hairy after midnight once the nightclubs start to close.  Try to avoid driving into the city if you can help it. Seriously, parking sucks.  If you ever get a chance, head north. Exmouth/Broome/Karijini etc are beautiful. Closer to home, Rottnest is also great.

Take newspapers as a key example - online news sites are cheaper to make than a physical paper and the actual process of generating the news can be streamlined online.  Radio is not so far out the door, but given the rise of playlist programmes such as Pandora it's hard to imagine why anyone would still listen to music a stranger has selected for them.

perth,3b177n,allahuakbar15,12,Thu Jun 25 03:34:54 2015 UTC,The price of ore isn't really what drove the wages higher. It was the demand for the resources to complete the jobs in the timeframes they wanted.

perth,3b177n,MindCorrupt,9,Thu Jun 25 13:22:07 2015 UTC,"To be fair, while i agree 150k is madness for driving a truck, you are expected to work long hours, be away from home and to live in a inhospitable environment. The mental toll it takes on most workers is non-trivial. To make up for this you do need to pay people more and i think 30k is hardly a fair recompense.   I do agree far too much money was thrown around for jobs and people should not expect these same jobs to continue paying absurd amounts of money. (I had a friend doing high voltage electrician work up north on 210k a year. He was 21 at the time.)."
perth,3b177n,recycled_ideas,8,Thu Jun 25 06:07:18 2015 UTC,"Yup. People say 150k is madness for driving a truck but it really depends on how many hours you put in, '150k' isn't really a good measurement as you could be doing 5 hour shifts or 16 hour shifts.  The accountant who earns $90k might get pissed off but he needs to remember he likely only works 8 hours a day 9-5 Mon-Fri and can more than likely actually take one month holidays every year and not much pressure coming to work if he is sick.  At the other end of the spectrum for example: a mate is a garbo and earns $200k, at first it's like holy shit that's excessive for a easy job but he works 3am - 7pm (16 hours) Mon-Sat and as it's contractor there is no sick leave, annual leave (a few Sunday's here and there if it's busy too) - then you need to lease the truck from the company and put fuel in it yourself along with maintaining insurance. In the end you probably only really get like $20 a hour or something and you just do nothing but drive all day and you simply cannot have a day off for a holiday or anything.   It's the same with trades, you think wow the electrician is getting $100 a hour but just consider every day he runs the risk of being electrocuted, and then the bricklayer will fuck his back up before he hits 40 etc etc"
perth,3b177n,dzernumbrd,4,Thu Jun 25 08:38:25 2015 UTC,It wasn't too much money; it was exactly what they were willing to pay to get the job done. Good for your mate for taking advantage of it at the time.

If it's then cut by 10% it's going to have a pretty negative impact.  Oh, and find me a truck driving job in perth that pays 30k a year.

perth,3b177n,CranberryPancakes1,2,Thu Jun 25 04:02:49 2015 UTC,"There's some truth to that, but realistically history says that what will happen is that six months from now she'll sack half the staff anyway and pocket the savings herself.  Taking a wage cut for the sake of your employer can sometimes be a good idea, but it really only works when your employer is also willing to take a haircut for you. Otherwise you just lose.  Nothing about Gina indicates that she's the type to make a sacrifice the next time things get tight to reward this sacrifice."
perth,3b177n,allahuakbar15,4,Thu Jun 25 12:42:25 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, much of the collapse of resource prices is due to mining companies flooding supply into the commodities market to drive out smaller operators.

China is stockpiling cheap ore so now iron prices will never reach the same levels again.  Rio and BHP could have dropped production to keep prices high but they chose to flood the market anyway. This can be seen as a way to get rid of smaller competition (it's happened in the past and is a good business strategy) but they both maintain that it's their right to sell their goods and make profits (which they are, but at much smaller margins). So  you're kinda right, it wasn't their deliberate actions at the start that is driving smaller producers under, but they are making the most of a shitty situation (Chinas drop in demand) to make sure they remain on top.   And Ginas Roy Hill wasn't involved with any of this because they haven't started production yet."

Welcome to the WA Government's Northern Corridor plan. Where they plan to build the suburbs all the way to Geraldton, meanwhile in the South/East, there is shitloads of vacant land that could be infilled.  I piad $185,000 for my 600sqm block in Maddington (which is 25km from the CBD) while blocks in Butler at the same time were going for $300,000 for 300sqm, all because apparently living in the North is luxury.   I don't know if there is a trend of doing 7-4 shifts at the office or just more people taking the car to work.   Quite a few people I know who used to train it to work and who don't work in the CBD, have switched to driving since the $2 a day charge came in. Considering it costs something like $11 a day to catch public transport if you park at the station, and they already have a car, spending $50 a weekon fuel that gets you the doorstep at your work in the comfort of your own bubble is more attractive."

I'm fine with people building that far north, just annoyed that people build houses all the way out there, and then want to complain about the traffic to the city every morning.

Jandakot airport is sitting right in the way of everyone travelling to and from the city for work, forcing all the traffic onto Albany Highway, Nicholson Road, Ranford Road and Jandakot road. The traffic is awful now and it's only going to get worse as the suburbs continue to grow down here.

I wouldn't assume only SAE would accept him without doing further research. His citizenship is not relevant for admission -- only his qualifications and level of English.   The best Registered Training Organisations for his course are the TAFEs and WAAPA. Others might be great, but don't have the same reputation and may not exist in a couple of years, whereas the TAFEs and WAAPA are public institutions (part of the WA state government)."

It's a lot more expensive than going to university or TAFE, especially for international students.   Personally if I was looking for a sound production course, I would choose TAFE. Mainly because you get to build a lot of strong connections within the local music scene. TAFE is quite involved with the scene - they hold a yearly gig, several bands started at TAFE - and in the creative industries, making connections is paramount."

We hadn't found TAFE in our internet research, but they look awesome and way cheaper so he sent an email to them tonight!   If anyone has any other advice or commentary, feel free to contribute.

I think the under the right circumstances if you can merely prove a certain practical competency if you can get speak to the right Department & Faculty staff.  Not that I've looked into the discipline of Audio Engineering, but I find the various websites of TAFE and their Campus & Managing bodies confusing as all hell.   Talk to humans. Make notes.

The police believed that if they left control in the hands of the gunman, he would not do anything. If he did they would go in, but they would not trigger a shooting by trying to forcibly wrest control from him.  Once hostages started bolting from the shop, it was clear that the gunman did not have control. If you're a gunman and threatening people with your gun is not having the desired effect, the next step is to use it.  It was obvious that the first hostages running from the shop should've caused the Police to do one of two things; storm the building and take control themselves, or; use some form of communication (loud hailer - whatever) to direct the hostages to fucking stay put and don't trigger a shooting - thus putting the gunman back in control without him resorting to shooting someone as an example.  However, NSW police did neither. Eventually (in Man Haron's mind), he was forced to shoot someone in order to try to reassert control. That was a totally foreseeable outcome of hostages that fail to comply. Why did they do neither? Because they were too afraid of the possible bad consequences of making a decision either way, so they just froze. It was pretty stunning incompetence that cost lives."

Apparently it partly uses hypnotherapy and I read every dull, repetitive word in the book over 3 months (I procrastinated a lot). I finished at midnight, didn't bother having my last cigarette that it encourages you to have. Went to sleep then woke up and the first thing I did was bin the rest of my smokes. It was almost my birthday, coming up to exam time in my masters degree, and I loved that first cigarette of the day. It was a breeze. Two days later I was having a coffee with a friend and barely noticed that she was smoking. I didn't feel awkward being sociable without a fag in my hand, I wasn't watching her cigarette with my tongue hanging out of my mouth. I barely registered it. I went to Thailand a few months later and didn't miss smoking while I lazed around by the pool. Used my duty free quota for my aunt (back when you could get a carton). Four years this October I've been smoke free. If you have an ereader I definitely recommend giving it a shot. No cravings, no struggle, 99% of the time it was like thinking ""I haven't had a smoke for a while. Guess I should have one. Oh but I don't smoke so I won't bother"". Honestly that easy. My ma struggled with patches 20 years ago and she really REALLY struggled. I felt so guilty that I didn't go through any of that as punishment for my stupid choices."

I also enjoyed smoking but really wanted to quit because my partner and I were seriously discussing getting pregnant and I knew it wasn't enough to make me quit.   All through the book you are encouraged to smoke and at the end he tells you to decide when you want to have your last ever cigarette. I still haven't had it, I just lost all desire to smoke by the end.   And I'm sure you'll do it way faster than 3 months! I procrastinated like fuck, partly because it was bad enough reading boring stuff for uni, I didn't want to do it in my spare time. And if I'm honest, I was a bit scared of finishing in case it failed or in case it worked. I had no idea how to be a non smoker. I only picked it up again because I was putting off exam study.

I check his invoice and compared it to the parts in his system, and noticed they put a different slightly lower end model of a nvidia graphics card instead of the one printed on his invoice. We went to Austin, they only wanted to change the graphics card over, but not the monitor. They fed us the BS dead pixel policy but we wanted a complete refund. We spent 10 mins of arguing our case but they refused to budge. Until I mentioned I should take it up with consumer affairs coz the graphics card was different to the one on the invoice.

You will not need the i7 and 16 gb ram unless you are doing serious photo /video editing.

I highly recommend building your own, it is simple if you take it slow and follow a guide.

One thing I have noticed when towing something heavy though is that when you have a hill, speeding up to 120 or so before the hill makes it easier to get over it. When you have roads like Albany Hwy, that most of the time have overtaking lanes on the hills, it makes it a bit hard to please everyone. I assume this is a design decision so that cars can pass trucks easier."

Was on single lane two way Nicholson Road heading north from Armadale Road. Speed limit is 80 on there, guy in front of me does 55 and isn't speeding up so I go to overtake him, when I get alongside him, he speeds up and starts matching my speed. A car is now coming towards me and this fucker next to me won't let me back over. We're doing about 90 at this point. I had a choice to either drop back (which I should have done) or rev the fuck out of my engine and swerve in front. Missed the oncoming car by maybe 5 metres doing about 110 now, actually had to cut off the car I was overtaking as he sped right up too.  Couple of things. Don't do what I did, if someone speeds up and won't let you overtake, drop back behind them, it's not worth risking your life over some dickhead.   The other thing, if someone is overtaking you, you should let them pass, or both your lives are at risk.    The way you drive when you are being overtaken can add to safety on  our roads so, please:  •  Never drive in a manner that prevents another vehicle from  overtaking yours.

I could drive 110 on our freeways (weather and congestion permitting) and never have an accident. These clowns that sit in the middle or right lanes doing 90-95 forcing others to drive around them cause more frustration and potential incidences than me doing 108!!!  Surely, given the quality and safety of most cars on the road now, 110 would be fine. I know - revenue raising. The law treats us drivers as idiots - we can drive safely at 110 or turn left on red as an example. There are inept drivers on the roads regardless of the speed limits but hamstringing the majority is not the answer."
perth,3aoc1g,nahcoob,7,Mon Jun 22 04:46:16 2015 UTC,Roads have a design speed that will feel quite conservative if in a modern vehicle. They are designed for safe stopping sight distance for trucks as well as cars.

perth,3aoc1g,shitmyspacebar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:04:31 2015 UTC,"Often roads have a design speed 10km/h more than there posted speed. I'm not aware of the circumstances of the section of freeway you are referring to. Politics does come in to posted speeds too unfortunately. I'd love to see the design of the freeway south, I suspect parts of it would be suitable for 130km/h easy.   Volume of cars doesn't impede the stopping sight distance available on a road. It is a measure of the amount of sight distance available for a driver to be able to see an object on the road. Obviously the greater the design speed, the greater the required stopping sight distance. If people choose to tailgate, that is beyond the control of those who design roads."

perth,3aoc1g,Kosmo777,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:20:54 2015 UTC,It's downvoted (not by myself though) I think because the location of these fixed speed cameras aren't exactly hidden from the public. It's not hard to slow down to 100 for 30 seconds and then speed back up to 110 once the camera is out of sight. That and the hivemind on this subreddit really frowns upon speeding.  I agree that the reasoning is totally valid though. Not something that I can ever see changing though.
perth,3aoc1g,StankPlanksYoutube,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:25:48 2015 UTC,I certainly wasn't trying to justify my speeding. I'm the true idiot for not knowing the camera was there and dropping $600 over 3 days is a very big lesson.   My point is that the focus is on making money and not picking up the people who truly don't know how to drive and are often oblivious to their own wrong doing. How many times have most of us probably passed someone who is doing 95 in the right lane and then looking in the mirror seeing numbers of cars going around the same person.   It is these people who frustrate me. If I'm doing 110 in the right lane and I see someone coming up behind me (clearly speeding more than me) I pull over and let them pass. It just isn't that difficult.

As do all council libraries (like City of Melville Library Service and City of Cockburn Library Service), the City of Perth library has fiction, non fiction, audio books, music, DVDs, and public access computers.  The State Library or the Alexander Library is the state reference library and includes the State Archives. You can join the State Library and even borrow some of the stock from the State Reference library, but the borrowing has certain limits (the illuminated manuscripts the State Library owns can never be borrowed, that sort of thing). The State Library has no fiction items in stock except for the literature section in the 800 classification area.  All council libraries have stock from the Public Library Stock, purchased and organised by the State Library of Western Australia's Public Library section. It is up to the councils to supplement this collection, depending on their budget. Public Library Stock can be loaned between council libraries, through the interlibrary loan system, at no charge. You may find that if you are not a resident of that council area, but a non-resident member you may not be able to use the interlibrary loan system, but most council library services are pretty relaxed about that nowadays. Some council libraries will loan both local and PLS items as interlibrary loans.  Before the State Reference Library became a lending library council librarians were sometimes able to request items from the State Library on interlibrary loan. There were sometimes strict rules on these items - they were often not allowed to leave the council library.  Source: used to work in council libraries."

perth,3aoyxq,philosaurus_rex,4,Mon Jun 22 14:13:52 2015 UTC,"Depends really on what you are looking for.  If you just want fiction,  might as well stay local.  For non fiction,  definitely better resources at Perth.  But it is free so you could actually do all of the above and then see what works best.  With cockburn and Melville,  you used be be able to join both and gave them on the same library card,  which saves stuff in the wallet.  That may have changed.  Might be able to do that with Perth too.  And once you join,  you can get an app that will allow you to download audio books too."
perth,3aoyxq,kellyju,3,Mon Jun 22 13:42:59 2015 UTC,The library allows you to order books from other libraries in the state. So as long as it is somewhere in the system you can get access to it.

City of Cockburn has Spearwood, Success and Coolbellup.  As the City of Perth only has one library, and not a big one at that, you'll find more items at your local libraries. Also, there is over 2 million items in circulating Public Library Stock around the state that your local library can bring in for you.  The State Reference Library has a lot of stock, but no fiction, beyond the literature section in the 800s."

perth,3anibp,comical_imbalance,5,Mon Jun 22 01:58:55 2015 UTC,Putting a price on kid's entry = lots of adults choosing not to go. And for every adult who doesn't go there's likely a good $50 lost from their own ticket plus extortionate food and drink pricing.
perth,3anibp,gattaaca,6,Mon Jun 22 06:14:03 2015 UTC,"You know the WA Government doesn't run the Royal Show, right? The ""decided not to fund free entry"" just means that the government has decided not to throw a bunch of tax money at the Royal Agricultural Society this year.   Kids get in free. The Royal Agricultural Society (RAS) still charges entry, but the people who enter don't pay. They charge the Government instead all behind the scenes like.   The ""more money spent on food, drinks, rides and showbags, by the kids and the full paying adults that bring them"" is correct, but government is effectively paying for folk to go in to the show and spend that money which they don't really get back in any way.

I've always been shocked by the money parents will fork out in their kids' show bags. When I went as a kid we would maybe get one of the smallest bags or some other thing from a stall as a special treat, possibly go on one ride, then spend the rest of the time seeing the animals and agriculture stuff. I've always liked animals more than rides though so that for me was an amazing day out. Still think free entry for small children should be an option but it doesn't need to cost a small fortune to take them to the show."

perth,3anibp,CyanideRemark,6,Tue Jun 23 04:43:35 2015 UTC,This is probably in part: Government scunging money because of the state debt and part because Colin would rather see the royal show moved to somewhere else which would free up the land for development.

perth,3anibp,carlordau,2,Mon Jun 22 05:03:37 2015 UTC,"The show being where it is makes no real sense.  Good shows/fairs exist because the farmers would be going anyway and if they can get some money from visitors that's icing on the cake. Those are not only cheaper they're more fun.  The soul of the show has been gone for years, it's just an attempt to try and fleece parents for entry to a fair whose sole remaining content is just more crap to buy. Crap you can buy at a community fair for far less money a month later."
perth,3anibp,recycled_ideas,-1,Mon Jun 22 15:23:20 2015 UTC,To be honest I don't know why they didn't move the show elsewhere when the Speedway was closed considering it was the beginning of the end regarding the harsh noise restrictions in place on the venue. the potential land value would give the government a hard on if they were able to rezone and develop it.

Throw in a few rides and showbags and you're getting closer to $100, but to me the show isn't something you do every year because it doesn't change that much one year to the next.

perth,3aodgq,nahcoob,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:01:32 2015 UTC,The provision for this line to be built at a later date was made when the Thornlie spur and the Mandurah line were built. The tunnelling and space to link the two together under the Kwinana Fwy has already been done.  It's also part of the original route for the Mandurah line that the libs proposed in the 90s.
perth,3aodgq,The_Valar,2,Mon Jun 22 07:22:19 2015 UTC,Mandurah via Thornlie was the original plan put forward and had construction started by the Court state government (hence why the Thornlie spur exists; it had already been graaded and tunnelled).  It was only later (after election of the Gallop government) that the designated route was changed to a central freeway alignment (to replace the express-busway that was already partway built). This changed also knocked 12 minutes of the time between Perth and Mandurah.

And on a bad weather day, the wind may be coming from a different direction, the opposite runway may be in use, so taking off to the northeast, rather than southwest (as they usually do all summer, when the doctor is in)."

perth,3ahxnj,stumblingaxis,2,Mon Jun 22 02:17:20 2015 UTC,"I happen to be an armchair expert in the matter! Finally something I am useful for!  I used to live in Canningvale and for the first year or so of living there it was okay but as time went on it started to drive my dad more and more crazy, he went from a calm and kind person to a rage fulled mad man in the space of months!  Since Jandicot airport is literally right there prop planes are a common appearance but around 2009 they were flying lower, faster and later to the point where they were zooming by at 9pm on a week night which was driving my dad insane, so he got a lawyer and started tracking their flights in an XLS he even got a search light and binoculars so he could try read the numbers of the offending flights to build his case (obviously almost impossible).   The problem is that the noise laws exclude planes so the only way he could take the airport to court was if he could prove they were breaking the law (flying faster and later than they were aloud) which they most certainly were,  more than once a week. But since this was all happening at night we couldn't write any plane numbers down and Jandicot refused to help us unless we could tell them which plane was causing the issue even though they knew exactly who was in the air.   It drove my dad so far as calling the government for help, a lawyer and he even tried to start a class action lawsuit against the airport until he gave up, sold the house and moved a few suburbs over.   Since it is such a sore topic I have a fair understanding of and up to date information on the flight paths in and around Perth and yeah man the answer is they moved the flight paths lower due to pressure from suburbs further up the shit pipe (thank god we moved or I think my dad would have killed himself).  True story."
perth,3ahxnj,ruddegar,20,Sat Jun 20 13:50:58 2015 UTC,Circuit training is legal until 10:30pm at night on weekdays at Jandakot so nothing illegal was being done. Also Jandakot is used as a base for the Royal Flying Doctors Service and as such aircraft are landing and taking off at all times of the day and night.  Why would someone move into a suburb adjacent to one of the busiest airports (by aircraft movement) in Australia and then not only complain about aircraft noise but also try and take legal action? There's a word for people like that but I'll let you try and think of one.

perth,3ahqwf,Keamy,9,Sat Jun 20 10:41:14 2015 UTC,"Most burglaries happen in broad daylight when people are at home. Certain people just walk in your unlocked door, sneak into a room with no occupants and start filling their pockets. Then they'll load up on anything they can carry while still being able to run and walk straight out, usually into a waiting car.   I've witnessed more than one neighbourhood house being burgled this way. Two of them involved the occupant coming face to face with the burglar.  The first one happened in Canning Vale. Two aboriginal men were scoping out houses until they found one with a screen door open. The husband was gardening and since it was a corner house he couldn't see the guy go into the door on the other side. His wife got out of the shower and came face to face with a guy pocketing her jewellery. Luckily her scream startled him and he ran out into the car where the other guy was waiting and took off. He stole most of her jewellery.   The other one was similar. A guy was home alone but working in his study, so he had the front door open. He went to the toilet or something and an aboriginal man walked straight in, grabbed his laptop he was using at the time, his phone and some other crap. The occupant caught him walking out of the study with the laptop tucked under his arm, yelled something like ""what are you doing?"" at him. The guy just booked it out the door and ran down the street. Occupant didn't chase him and we didn't find the guy.  Moral of the story: Lock your doors even when you're home. Don't leave phones, wallets and keys lying around where someone can just grab them.   If you're worried about burglaries in your area, keep an eye out for cars slowly driving by in your neighbourhood, especially if you see them multiple times. Note the make, model, colour and licence plate if you can. If there are any burglaries, report the information to the police as someone suspicious in the area. They'll run the plates and it will usually turn up as a stolen car."
perth,3ahqwf,Orichalcon,11,Sat Jun 20 11:11:39 2015 UTC,I don't know how to not make this sound racist by today's standards but it's a good tip that if u see aboriginal kids walking by your house more than once in a day when u have never seen them before they are scoping your house. I went to 2 different schools and in the morning and at recess they would sell us or trade all the stolen goods they got on te walk home the day before or on the way that morning.
perth,3ahqwf,Keamy,6,Sat Jun 20 13:52:56 2015 UTC,"I stopped worrying about being called a racist when giving advice like this.   I'm not saying all aboriginal people are thieves, and I'm not saying all thieves are aboriginal. However, in both of my cases where people identified their burglar, it was an aboriginal individual. I'd be suspicious of anyone cruising up and down my street slowly (and I've snapped photos of more than one trashy white person's numberplate.) But I'm especially suspicious of aboriginal people cruising around or looking suspicious.   Statistics back me up. Despite representing 2.4% of the overall population, 49.3% of people detained for burglary identified as aboriginal or torres strait islander. That's not including juvenile offenders.

In both a residential and commercial context I've found Sunday Mornings, 5 - 7am to be a major hot spot for break and enters outside of the typical broad daylight type ones you describe  - it seems to be the time the police are stretched to the limit (based upon the super long response times to the burglaries ive experienced) , and this is really taken advantage of by thieves."

We have been working to open a new site and she is the manager of one part of it - let's call it ""area A"". Her boss is the site manager and is not directly responsible for ""area A"" but IS directly responsible for another part of the business, ""area B"".   Since it's a retail biz, we work in shifts and are currently horribly short staffed. It's my girlfriend's job to manage ""area A"" and she needs to do this during peak times, mostly in the morning, especially on the weekends.  This contrasts with her boss' responsibility to cover ""area B"" during peak times, which are usually in the morning and evening. If she chooses to come in in the mornings, there is no one to close the store in the evenings except my girlfriend, who has already put in a full 8-9hour shift. For a month or so, she has been doing the full double shift and sometimes just the evening while her boss is in ""area B"" only in the mornings. It wasn't until this past week that her boss actually started closing ""area B"" as per her responsibility. So my girlfriend (let's call her Meg from now on) has been covering her boss' job for a month.  Additionally, her boss and her boss' boss (let's star calling them Kate and Mike) are very close, some employees have commented inappropriately so (but that's not really the issue). They constantly discuss what Kate needs to do to get ""area B"" up and running smoothly, what policies need to be in place, how to go about it, etc...  When Meg asks for assistance from Mike about how to set a policy or complete an order or something, his responses are short and dismissive: ""Just call them. Figure it out."" One particular instance, maybe a week or so ago, Meg needed to order something from a supplier, but didn't know how to go about it. She asked Mike for help. Mike said ""Just call the supplier."" Obviously the procedure is NOT this simple. Anyone who's worked in retail knows you need purchase orders, authorization numbers and invoices. So she asked him again. Same response. She asked again. Same response. Two days later, it's Meg's day off, and the first thing she does is log in to her device to place the order (if she can). Turns out the order was placed an hour earlier. By Mike. the next day, she gets it from him for not doing her job. This is just one example of many.  Going back to the shift situation, Meg has a responsibility to write the procedures for ""area A"" which she hasn't been able to do because she's been covering ""area B"" for Kate. Of course she gets it from both Kate and Mike for not having her procedures done in a timely fashion.  I realize, after reading some of this that it may sound petty. But believe me, after over a month of dealing with this every single day, it's hard not to feel like you're being ganged up on."
perth,3ahui9,Brewjo,4,Sat Jun 20 12:33:43 2015 UTC,"This is a little beside the point, but I've actually seen this kind of stupidity in many different places.  I've also known several people from overseas who have remarked on how workplaces in Australia and Perth in particular, in this sort of retail shop front and office environment, are just pathologically awful at teaching people their jobs and then treating them like crap for not being able to keep up.  You get half what you need to know about some place's often arcane and counter intuitive practices and systems and then the management answer to you not knowing everything in a day is arse cover and bitch and moan about you.  It's a weird, quasi-military abstruse-ness, I guess I'd call it.  A mask to protect poor management and communication and mates by pushing blame onto others.  And this goes on a whole lot, in a wide variety of unrelated businesses of that sort.  New employees aren't informed of their real rights or real anything so they can be molded to do whatever work makes the manager look good.  Just always kept on the back foot.  This happens lot with young workers, but also with foreign workers a lot too.  Based on this I don't know if I'd call it bullying exactly.  But I wasn't there and don't really know the criteria.  It's definitely wrong and should definitely be complained about.  In a small office where one person is bearing the brunt of this sadly common attitude, I hope it does fit the bill enough for a complaint to get proper attention.  Secondly, and this is beside the point too really;  If it's just these two doing all this stuff mainly and they seem to dislike her and want her moved out so a friend can come in -  Who gave your girlfriend the job?  Was it one or both of them?"
perth,3ahui9,Captain_Poopy,3,Sat Jun 20 23:16:08 2015 UTC,"As someone who was a retail manager for a few years, the key issue is unless required for compliance reasons (e.g financial/banking industry), most retail businesses in Australia pretty much refuse to pay for any more then a day of training or induction type thing. Then its left to often overworked and under-resourced managers to try their best to squish in both on the job and product training along with all their other normal duties.   The result? Frustrated managers, that get unjustifiably angry with new, poorly trained staff. New staff feel like shit and lose motivation immediately. Even in businesses that do offer comprehensive paid training, it is often dumped on a regular sales consultant who doesn't know much more then the new employee.  Employees not been aware of their rights seems to be endemic, especially those on work visas (and young workers as yo said) because it's not seen as the employers job to tell them. IMO it should be taught in schools, and explained in the literature given to those emigrating to Australia."

Try somewhere quieter like Lovina up north for a bit more peace and quiet, the farther you go from all the huge tourist spots the more you'll see the people are actually really nice. I went into a warung right around the corner from all the big hotels and restaurants once and got this huge meal for all of $.50.

I mean it must be good if my dad says when he retires, he's gonna move to Manilla (the Kuta of Phillipines) to live out the rest of his days.   Also Cambodia. Cheapest place to holiday in by far.

Stick to the CBD - Take Uber for the travel ($5-10 p/trip) There are tons of pubs and bars around CBD that you could go visit and have a few drinks.  Mountain Goat Pub/Brewery was pretty awesome (Bit further out though a really great atmosphere.)  Definitely recommend it for a few nights.    As a family we went there a few weeks back - stayed at the cheap Ibis Hotel near the airport for the night.  Then travelled into the CBD via Taxi and had breakfast at the Grain Store which was quite nice and a bit up-class barista style restaurant.  We stayed on Collins St which was okay.

Nevertheless, given the consistent effect of vitamin C on the duration and severity of colds in the regular supplementation studies, and the low cost and safety, it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin C is beneficial for them.

The City of Perth (COP) are enforcing them and removing camping equipment, not the protesters, the police are merely there to protect the COP workers and try to keep the peace.

perth,3a8okw,theenglishguy72,10,Thu Jun 18 03:19:11 2015 UTC,The West Australian government plans to shut down 150 of the state's 174 Aboriginal communities   They don't want Aboriginal communities to be closed down. At the very least they want consultation before they go ahead. The state government has just announced the closure without discussing it with the people who live their first.
perth,3a8okw,aussiekinga,9,Thu Jun 18 03:26:15 2015 UTC,"The state actually has 274 communities, not 174. But I shall give hte article the benefit of the doubt and say it was a mistake/typo.  And in 115 of those communities, there is an average of just four people. There is a huge cost of providing power, water and other services to a community that is only 4 people"
perth,3a8okw,theenglishguy72,10,Thu Jun 18 03:28:23 2015 UTC,yeh i may sound like a cunt. But on a per person ratio the governement would be spending so much money for so little people. Totally non sustainable.... close them down and let them have to option of being relocated to another open community  of choice.
perth,3a8okw,theenglishguy72,3,Thu Jun 18 03:34:48 2015 UTC,I don't have a problem with that. I just think the government should have consulted with the people there first.
perth,3a8okw,henry82,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:37:11 2015 UTC,That changes it quite a bit actually - 50% vs. 80% are going to be closed. My main concerns are that people living there aren't having a say in what happens and that Aboriginal people won't be able to live near their homeland.
perth,3a8okw,showmanic,9,Thu Jun 18 03:40:40 2015 UTC,"Aboriginal people won't be able to live near their homeland.   Well, they can, they just won't have their lifestyle subsedised by the government."
perth,3a8okw,xheist,3,Thu Jun 18 04:35:41 2015 UTC,Bropho camp v2. And that really went well the first time.
perth,3a8okw,xheist,12,Thu Jun 18 03:30:10 2015 UTC,"If the state government doesn't shut down these communities but lets them go unfunded and eventually deteriorate, then what? Will they complain that the government is ignoring them and claim human rights abuse and negligence? I'm not sure they can have it both ways."
perth,3a8okw,xheist,2,Thu Jun 18 03:47:41 2015 UTC,What we're essentially doing is telling these Aboriginal people that their chosen lifestyle (living in a remote area) is not compatible with Australian society... We won't provide basic services and amenities for that lifestyle.  But what happens when you shut those communities down.. to the people that're left homeless.. are they going to suddenly move to the city and get a 9-5? Or are they going to roam about homeless for a while before establishing another remote community?  Edit: Not that leaving them there fixes any issues in those communities... But I think demolishing communities will only shift them.  Edit2 from comment further down.. Aboriginal leaders and the Indigneous Affairs Minister suggest that the closures will cause more problems and be more expensive... if that's true then the people in those communities aren't being at all unreasonable -- they're in line with the stated aims of the government to minimise problems and expense.
perth,3a8okw,xheist,13,Thu Jun 18 04:12:07 2015 UTC,"But how can they choose to live in a remote area AND expect that it gets funded? If they are truly living off the land in their traditional ways, why are we funding it?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not against us providing those services (I'd much rather the money we pay them for use of their land go to building infrastructure and these services rather than cash payments) but if they want government assistance and input, then it goes without saying that the government has some say in how they allocate the resources."
perth,3a8okw,henry82,4,Thu Jun 18 04:20:24 2015 UTC,"Lets not kid ourselves. The land is the commonwealth's. Aborigines were out rightly conquered and defeated. They have no claim as a culture to this land.   The only reason the government humours them is to keep them out of sight, out of mind."
perth,3a8okw,gaspah,0,Fri Jun 19 00:01:12 2015 UTC,"They were conquered under British Law ie as the Brits did not recognise the Aboriginal's as being any sort of owner under British laws, they decided that they could take it. Do you not see a flaw in that logic?"
perth,3a8okw,Geminii27,0,Fri Jun 19 00:24:44 2015 UTC,Nope. Conquered = Aboriginal's lost the land = Commonwealth owns it now.
perth,3a8okw,Geminii27,0,Fri Jun 19 01:04:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think conquer is the right word. They came in, said ""we don't recognise your claim to ownership under British law so it now belongs to us"" so they decided they owned  it. Why would a traditional owner who who has never even heard of Britain have to play by their rules?  Will you be so accepting of this logic when the Chinese decide to come and ""conquer"" Australia?"
perth,3a8okw,Geminii27,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:16:36 2015 UTC,"Doesn't really matter, even if Commonwealth recognised ownership, you think that would stop them moving in with the military? The fact is that like or not, the indigenous are no longer owners of the land. They have no claim nor right to it. However they could've made the most of it and built a living off the tourism sector if they wanted too. But they, as a group cried foul and whined and moaned rather than moved on. Yes there was slavery and a foul mark on Australia's history till 1980's but there are also many aborigines that broke the cycle and made the best of it.   In 1778, the only rules out there was with military might. Might is right.   Will you be so accepting of this logic when the Chinese decide to come and ""conquer"" Australia?

perth,3a8okw,gaspah,4,Thu Jun 18 05:20:58 2015 UTC,"I bet the government will plan to move them to larger communities, as a more cost effective use of resources.  tbh i don't think it's an unreasonable idea. The government shouldn't be funding what is a lifestyle choice. If it's not a lifestyle choice, then they'll be fine to survive on their own without government assistance.   But I think demolishing communities will only shift them.   Sure, but at least they'll have the ability to be resolved. If they're moved to an area where they can get decent food, resources, medical assistance, jobs, and even police oversight, that's one step closer to resolving ongoing issues and breaking the current cycle."
perth,3a8okw,aussiekinga,2,Thu Jun 18 04:34:22 2015 UTC,"Its not compatible. White/Asian/African etc people can't go live in the middle of bumfuck nowhere and get the government to pay for it.

perth,3a8okw,xheist,21,Thu Jun 18 05:17:38 2015 UTC,"It isn't the classiest protest ever but at least they are standing up for themselves. The people on Heirisson Island aren't violent or dangerous, the campsite is just dirty. They are a minority who mostly live in rural WA and no one is listening to their concerns. At least this way people take notice of them.   How else are they going to show their angry over the closure of Aboriginal communities? I'm sure they agree that changes need to be made, but suddenly announcing their closure isn't going to help anyone. If all services to any other town or suburb in WA were suddenly cut without any community consultation people would be up in arms as well. At the very least talk to the people there first"
perth,3a8okw,metao,8,Thu Jun 18 03:35:36 2015 UTC,"In the past 10 odd years I've been living in Perth, I've never been assaulted by an aboriginal person. Well, that changed yesterday.  When I was riding my bicycle home from work, I rode past heirisson island. On the bike path, there was 3 huge aboriginals guys, high as kite, blocking the path on a narrow bridge. I couldn't stop in time and nudged one of the guys, he turned around and gave me a good shove on to the road, luckily there was a barrier.  A lot of swearing was exchanged.  I gave him a good kick and rode on my way.  I can't help but think, what do these fuckheads contribute to society in any shape or form ?   Why can't they just go get a job or something and be normal ?  Go get a job, save up some money, get a mortgage, raise your family, etc  Is that too much to ask ?"
perth,3a8okw,shorelines100,14,Thu Jun 18 03:50:28 2015 UTC,"Why can't they just go get a job or something and be normal ? Go get a job, save up some money, get a mortgage, raise your family, etc Is that too much to ask ?   I did a project management class in uni and the project was about getting Aboriginal people more involved in work and technology. Our particular task was getting the aboriginal people to learn how to use computers/tablets with aboriginal support features, which is ultimately designed to help them get a job. We found this project not feasible, because lots of aboriginal people get a really poor start to life. Just getting a job and making money isn't so simple when you have little education and are surrounded in an aboriginal culture which is to share everything you have, all your possessions/money. Many Aboriginal people feel an immense amount of shame about this topic and they typically find it very embarrassing when others find out they can't even read.   Imagine if you were an aboriginal person who was born and grew up in an aboriginal family. You live far out east in a small country town. Your parents rarely went to school, and are on the booze. Your parents only get centrelink money, and spend most of that money on their addiction. You are never encouraged to go to school and do well academically. You don't get to learn any computer/I.T skills because you have no money. You grow up learning not a lot besides just ""you can do nothing and get money from the government"". What money you do earn is taken by your closest peers, sometimes even taking your money/possessions without asking.  It's a constant cycle of a lack of education and aboriginal children not getting anywhere. It's a pretty tough thing to ask when you start off like that."

Any aboriginal who knows other aboriginees is always a complete fuckup. 32 years (my whole life), never seen a single exception to this.

I know this place is on the up and up since I walked past 4*3L bottles of urine sitting at/poured over a bus stop near the start of newburn rd.  I grew up in Girrawheen and by comparison this place is like the Brady Bunch visits Auchwitz. So I spent my formative years hanging out with and knowing plenty of aboriginal people, but YOU have witnessed hundreds with jobs/contributing to society?   Spending the first half of my life growing up where I did taught me one thing, that all families were all fundamentally the same. Whether they be British, Vietnamese, Chinese, Indian, Italian or whatever the fuck, they were all hard-working people trying to provide the best possible future for their children. That is everyone except for the Aboriginal families.  They're the only ones who didn't give a shit about working, how their kid was going at school, whether their house had bare concrete floors and shit all over the walls or not. There were some white folk that lived pretty bad compared to non-white people, but none were quite near the not-give-a-fuck scale of living of every single Aboriginal household I've spent time with.  You give me just 1 name of an aboriginal that you know personally, what they do, where they live and a few other aboriginal peole they hang out with. I don't need hundreds, just one. Not someone you've seen on TV, not someone you've heard of, but someone you've shaken the hand of, someone you've had more than an hour worth of conversation with.  I'm sure there are exceptions to what I said in my previous comment, but I haven't known them, and I'm sure as shit that you haven't either. Maybe in other parts of Australia this may not be the case so much as here, but Noongars are all peices of shit (I'm not part Noongar, I'm part some SA tribe that I haven't given 2 mins of my life to find out which).  Don't get me wrong, I give every single person I meet a blank slate. I do come with my prejudices, but I give everyone the benefit of the doubt. But at least Aboriginals usually help me out in this time of doubt when usually the first thing they say to me is ""scuse me you wouldn't happen to have $2?""  I don't want to be racist, but I am. I get along with people of all races and religions (even Aboriginal people). I just have found very few Aboriginal people in my life that were worth building a connection with (in my adult years I stopped making useless connections), and of those people none of them had any family/community ties with other Aboriginal people."
perth,3a8okw,VMaxF1,3,Fri Jun 19 00:01:59 2015 UTC,"I grew up near Northam. I went to both primary school and high school with a lot of aboriginal people. I am still friends with several of them. My father worked with a tonne of aboriginal people at the Wheatbelt Aboriginal Corporation. It was partially funded through grants via CDEP and partially through the profits of the multiple local businesses it owned and run. My dad was one of the few white guys there, most everyone else was Aboriginal - who were working and contributing to society. I used to volunteer with another Aboriginal friend of the family, who was a youth pastor at a local church, working with youth. So yes, I've had a lot of positive experiences with Aboriginal people in my life. I have also had negative experiences. but by far there were more positive and more interaction with people who had jobs and were contributing to society."
perth,3a8okw,VMaxF1,5,Fri Jun 19 01:21:21 2015 UTC,"Ok, well I believe that. Doesn't fit at all with my experience, but I still believe it. I guess life outside of the suburbs/city of perth may be quite different than what its like here. Perhaps the visibility of being part of a small town has some effect on this, perhaps the increased need for a cohesive community.. who knows."
perth,3a8okw,Geminii27,4,Fri Jun 19 01:35:38 2015 UTC,"There are still issues; there were riots in Northam a few years back because Northam is basically two large families/clans that doesn't always get along. A friends father (who is a well respected teacher at a school in the worst part of Northam) runs a friday night youth group/games night because otherwise kids as young as 6 are often just wandering around town and the programme at least gives them something to do and keeps them off the streets. Both Aboriginal and white people volunteer time to help run the night.   It's not some golden utopia of Aboriginal living there, but there are still a lot of great people doing hte best they can."

perth,3a8okw,VMaxF1,3,Fri Jun 19 03:25:14 2015 UTC,"Up North, a lot of the ones that do get jobs get ostracised by their own community for ""selling out"" to the white man (esp. when they get called coconuts or lamingtons i.e. brown on the outside, white on the inside).  On the other hand, what's the point of getting a job and a mortgage when you get the dole and a free house from the Government?"
perth,3a8okw,shorelines100,3,Fri Jun 19 06:59:10 2015 UTC,"I read something similar in the states but with the african americans that get accused of acting white if they did well in school.  If you're an aboriginal person, do you automatically get a free house? how does it work ?"
perth,3a8okw,VMaxF1,3,Fri Jun 19 07:05:57 2015 UTC,"To clarify - they don't actually get free houses (or free cars), one of two things happens:   They get put into public housing, for which some incredibly small, token amount of money is deducted as ""rent"" from their dole cheque  (which doesn't really matter, given that the house and the dole is paid for by the same people). They get given a house on a ""loan"", at zero percent interest that they're never expected to pay back, and isn't worth anything after they rip the doors out, light a fire in the living room, and have 17 of their aunty's cousin's nephew's brother's uncles living in a 3x1."

Go get a job, save up some money, get a mortgage, raise your family, etc Is that too much to ask ?   Well, yes. For a number of reasons, the odds are stacked against them to make what we would call a meaningful contribution. Sure, there are people (white and black) who overcome those odds and go on to do good things but its not as easy as just saying ""well they need to pull their fingers out."" They are exposed to crime, abuse, lack of education from a very young age and if thats all you know, you don't just magically fix that overnight.  Part of the problem is the way we try and rectify the issues. Throw some cash at them, give them jobs/contracts to keep the numbers looking impressive, and that should make amends for everything. And if anyone dares suggest that we shouldn't be giving them handouts or free passes because they fuck up those jobs(because its just a band-aid solution) they either play the race card or have someone do it for them and we have achieved nothing.  Its like we are trying to learn from the mistakes that America have made and trying to solve them before we've actually made them. We want to avoid massive civil rights protests so we pay them some hush money, which seems like a great idea to everyone at the time, but I don't believe we are any further advanced in fixing the issues than we were 30 years ago."
perth,3a8okw,koalaondrugs,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:32:23 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, they are basically told from birth that they will never amount to anything, and it's pretty hard to undo that sort of psychological damage when they are an adult, or even a teenager.

Even your opening line basically says that - ""never has a problem in 10 years, except for one incident yesterday"".  My dad (who like me, is white as white can be) used to work for/with a lot of Aboriginal people and most were great. Same as any workplace there were a few bad eggs, but generally it was really good. They worked hard, they cared for their kids etc.   They didnt ever really get a mortgage though. I recall my dad talking with one of the guys he worked with. The guy rented and the house he was in was up for sale. My dad was encouraging him to buy the place. The guy responded with something along the lines of ""but Aboriginal people don't buy houses. We just don't."". He didn't have any family or anything that owned their home. It wasn't in his culture and wasn't even on his radar. He did eventually buy it and apparently considers it one of hte best choices he's made. But it was a mental hurdle to do that. A paradim shift in how he and his family thought."

perth,3a8ybs,brenman,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:56:27 2015 UTC,"Fremantle Doctor:       The Fremantle Doctor, the Freo Doctor, or simply The Doctor is the Western Australian vernacular term for the cooling afternoon sea breeze which occurs during summer months in south west coastal areas of Western Australia. The sea breeze occurs because of the major temperature difference between the land and sea.

perth,3a8ybs,brenman,6,Thu Jun 18 15:42:52 2015 UTC,"Timeframes could be important. If you're setting your Perth scenes in a particular year, there will be notable differences between the previous year and the following one. In particular, make sure to get the right set of which major buildings are considered the best known, what their actual names are at the time, and what people have been calling them up until then (some of them tended to get renamed a lot).  It wouldn't hurt to check out the archives of local newspapers for that time and the years prior and after, so your characters (or people they meet) are able to talk about things which to them are very recent, but don't mention things which haven't happened yet. With politics in particular, major topics of discussion (including what people are irritated about) can shift on a daily basis. Opinions of politicians and other public figures are also variable.  Fashion can be odd, too, and it's not always in sync with American fashion. While urban Australians do tend to have an idea of what's happening in the US, we're more affected by the large amount of American TV and movies (which, again, aren't always released on the same schedules) than we are by American news, especially that which doesn't directly affect Australia. 9/11, for example, was more like hearing that someone we vaguely knew about on the other end of town got mugged. Sympathy, yes, but eventually a sense of annoyance that even local news channels couldn't go three seconds without referring to it yet again, even though there was no actual new information to be had.  If your characters aren't used to Perth temperatures, they might be surprised by them. Check the temperatures around the time your characters will have been visiting (or past averages for that time of year if it's set contemporarily). Our winters can have a lot of cloudless days of very warm weather, and our summers can melt roads.  All the signs (road signs, speedometers) are going to be in metric if the setting is sometime in the last couple of decades, even if the characters talk in imperial units amongst themselves. However, Australians are quite familiar with the imperial system and generally know what an inch, mile, foot etc is. We still often refer to personal heights in feet and inches, there's a storage unit called the 44-gallon drum, and so on. You might want to get your use of units beta-read by a native for increased accuracy. Note however that our previous use of imperial units is based on the UK system, not the US one - when we say 'pint' we used to mean a UK pint, and then for a while it referred informally to 600ml glass bottles that milk was delivered in."

Domestic water consumption makes up less than 10% of the total water usage within western Australia.  If you actually wanted to reduce water consumption then lobbying for Water Corp to charge corporate customers something on par with domestic users might be a good start.  Currently they pay a very small fraction of the domestic price, and they self report that consumption.  Coca Cola Amitil is the largest consumer of water in Western Australia.  Pretty sure they can afford to pay the market rate for the major ingredient in all of their products.  There is the valid argument that they further treat the water etc, and that it doesn't need to be treated to the standard of our drinking water before it is used by them.  However, considering that we have a major water shortage and are pumping underground aquifers dry to such an extent that we are injecting treated sewerage back just to try and maintain it is a real worry.  Perhaps Coca Cola Amitil shifting their operations away from somewhere that has a water shortage to somewhere where there's surplus might not be a bad thing.  We don't need to ship water down from the Kimberly to Perth, we just need to stop allowing Coca Cola Amitil to get it for almost free here in Perth, give it to them for almost free in the Kimberly and then let them wear the cost of shipping it down.  Make it a commercial problem for them rather than a civil one for us."

It was one of the main reasons I ever went down to the city at all.   Unfortunately the reason why they closed down is because Borders went bankrupt and had to close all stores worldwide."
perth,3a5bhm,djskein,2,Thu Jun 18 08:25:55 2015 UTC,"A little more complex then that, here in Australia anyway, though Borders US didn't last much longer regardless so I doubt they would have carried the brand on for much longer then it lasted regardless.  Pretty much, the company that owned Borders and Angus & Robertson in Australia got purchased by a private equity firm, who then ran the business into the ground to the point of it going under administration right on the brink of floating it on the ASX. Nobody was interested in buying the business/carrying the debt from it, so they shut the whole thing down. The leftover unsold stock/inventory is predominantly why there was so many crappy $5 bookshops around for the past couple years, as they purchased the entire inventory for a few cents on the dollar.  There is still tons of Borders-esque book shops in north america, apart from that business large bookshops as a whole don't seem to have suffered as much - Chapters/Indigo is still huge in Canada and it has an identical format to Borders. Most Barnes & Noble stores are huge too in the US. It's disappointing that large format bookstores in Australia completely died out after Borders exited."

perth,3a427i,CJJHRA,3,Wed Jun 17 01:47:14 2015 UTC,"I had a similar issue at the end of last year/start of this year. Speeds dropped from 7 or 8Mbps to just over 1. As frustrating as it was, I did all the tests of new cables, different modems etc and it was all looking like nothing was wrong at my end. So I went through all the troubleshooting with the expectation that it would trigger iinet to do their own tests....boy, was I mistaken.  First guy changed my package to thrillseeker or whatever it was called. Bumped speeds to 1.5 and he tried to say that was fixed. I explained why there was still something wrong and he said it might take a day to ""kick in"", if it doesnt, call back later. I read the notes online and he wrote that he improved the speeds and customer was happy.  Second guy tried to get me to do the same. I refused and he couldn't do anything else. I asked for the matter to be escalated.  Third person was the one to actually escalate it to visionstream. She took all my details and said I'd get a call to organise a time etc in the next day....except she forgot to tell visionstream. I got up them on twitter about it and they tried to say they couldn't do anything as it was the weekend. I argued and argued that they should have addressed this earlier in the week and they finally relented and got one of their seniors (are they called CMS or CVS or something?) to call me on the saturday.  He organised the VS tech to do his thing and the problem was solved within a week. It was a faulty line 500m from my property.  Long story short, they will do whatever they can to not escalate the issue, whether its because they don't want to wear the costs, or because the service reps you speak to aren't experienced enough. You need to keep pushing to get someone to do proper site tests from their end to try and isolate the problem. It may very well be something in your place but them doing nothing won't fix it. But this also means you may have to pay for repairs if its your issue."

If its telstras you're stuffed unless the speed drops down below the minimun adsl speed. If it is your house cabling you're out the money from the visionstream tech (its a fixed fee i think ~200) then you have to find some to fix it.

I can tell you that Telstra have a habit of using the faulty lines for Naked DSL because they don't have CSG attached to them if they break (you get paid money by Telstra is your phone line is down for multiple days).  I would still recommend all the basic troubleshooting tho. Cause 95% of the time a speed fault is normally on the customers end. Trying the basics like other people have probably said to you different sockets, different phone lines, different model of at all possible.  But something that iiNet CSRs aren't normally trained to check is the dB rating on your line (basically how much interference is on it) it would be interesting if you could get that number. Pretty sure if I remember correctly anything over 20 is bad and normally means a line issue.  But as apart of the $35 per 15 minute thing. Since it is a Naked DSL service. They will send out one of there own techs first (vision stream) which costs you nothing even if it an issue inside the premises. You only get charged if they call out a Telstra tech.

perth,3a427i,Lurk-SkyLurker,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:20:15 2015 UTC,Yeah they do pay CSG (it is actually Telstra wholesales money) if the fault is proven to be out of the premises and not your fault. It does have to be a phone line issue tho. CSG does not apply for DSL and NDSL outages if your phone line is still up. If I remember correctly after 2 working days of being out it is $34.60ish a day for a week then $14 a day after that. I have seen ones go into the hundreds ($750 odd).
perth,3a427i,Man_ning,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:36:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, so the fact that it ended up being a fault in a pit outside of my boundary would make it their problem then? This is the best news I've had in a long time. How do I go about kicking off that process?"

Your phone company must automatically pay you compensation when the maximum time frames are not met unless an exemption applies. If the company fails to pay compensation, you need to contact the company and seek to resolve the matter directly.  If you cannot resolve the issue with the phone company, you may raise the matter with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO). The TIO may investigate and, if necessary, determine an outcome.   Check out the link for more info, it describes the conditions and the payment amounts etc."
perth,3a427i,The_AverageGamer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:33:09 2015 UTC,No CSG on a Naked service. It only applies to a PSTN service (Home Phone).

Just looked at service notes, was without a working phone service for 22 months and 16 days.  I just used my mobile, but they were aware of it, even gave me a 50 credit when I finally got a dial tone.  I like iinet, but that's a fair bit of compo I'm due."
perth,3a427i,The_AverageGamer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:44:48 2015 UTC,"You say it wasn't working for 9 months, was that after you faulted it? CSG only counts from the day Telstra say they will come out and don't. If they say they have fixed the fault then CSG period ends.   If you were without a working land line service iiNet should credit you for the time where it wasn't active but the terms and conditions on their website say something about only needing to credit back 150 days total I think. Something like 5 months worth."
perth,3a427i,Man_ning,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:19:54 2015 UTC,"iiNet were aware there was a fault but didn't do anything until my line condition got so bad that my adsl couldn't sync. They never escalated it to Telstra as far as I am aware. Once it was with Telstra it was a very quick process but I had to really jump up and down to get them to escalate it.  I'll have to check my notes. But I defenitely rang and informed them I didn't have a dial tone and they said they would sort it out and let me know if I needed to be home at any stage for the tech.  Surely the csg applies to telcos, not just Telstra, that seems a little anti competitive."
perth,3a427i,The_AverageGamer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:40:48 2015 UTC,"iiNet make it a fault when you decide you want it to be a fault, you just have to agree to incorrect call out.  They can only escalate in very select situations, Telstra doesn't want them to escalate.  The applies to all ISP's, but only on phone lines and only for the days past two working days where Tesltra has not been able to fix the issue.  iiNet might credit you because it didn't work for awhile but CSG is only for landline faults past 2 working days where MSD doesn't apply.

perth,3a427i,zeekiz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:32:22 2015 UTC,No point swapping now. Swapping back to normal phone line is expensive and does take forever.  That sync speed is definitely cause for concern. Especially the upload speed.   Congestion for Netflix etc does not actually drop your sync speed but rather the speed you actually get is a lot less than it says in your modem.   Get Visionstream out there if you have done the basic troubleshooting. Hopefully it gets all sorted.   Keep me updated

Though I do think there should be some accountability on the department handing out a contract when they know there is no way it could be performed properly at that price. If experts say $1 million is the bare minimum to run properly and a company bids $500,000. You know they are cutting corners somewhere."

I'm gonna post the comment I made on this doco as one of the best customers over the last 6 years or so they were open.    RIP. I was hoping I could make a surprise cameo in this but sadly not. I didn't even know they were filming this doco there. Kinda a shame they couldn't get interviews with other Planet Video staff like Mandy or Nadia but it's still pretty interesting to watch. I've always found Haydn to be a fairly intimidating guy who's a bit rough around the edges but his interviews in here look very contemplative and lighthearted in particular his anecdote about the customer who was always on their phone every time they went down.   I haven't been down to Mount Lawley as much since they closed. I went down the day before they closed and bid my farewells to Lisa, the store manager and the last remaining staff member and told her to pass it on to the rest of the staff. I'm deeply saddened by it's loss and feel Mount Lawley is now a shadow of it's former self without it."

Sadly I haven't seen it being taught anywhere since I was at primary school, it's obviously out there somewhere but.   I just wanted to give a shout out to Batchelor Press, they've got quite a range of reasonably priced books if you wanna find some resources. They're mostly aimed at kids but it's better than nothing right? There's also a dictionary floating around online and a really really old (1840) vocabulary with grammar notes on Google Books. It's not much but I hope it helps."

Very cool book if you're local. They have a ton of other Noongar language learning material like posters and most of their books have a CD version too so you can hear the language as it's spoken.

I read an article recently that was reporting on some research suggesting that the brain structure of people with gender dysphoria is actually somewhat similar to the gender that they identify with. For example, a person who was born male but identifies as female has a brain structure somewhat similar to a ""typical"" female brain   Interesting stuff.  I think this is the paper, although I'm not well-versed enough in neuroscience or psychology to properly understand it beyond the abstract.   Deviations from the natal sex within sexually dimorphic structures were also observed in the untreated subsamples. Our findings thus indicate that GM [grey matter] distribution and regional volumes in GD [gender dysphoric] adolescents are largely in accordance with their respective natal [birth] sex. However, there are subtle deviations from the natal [birth] sex in sexually dimorphic structures, which can represent signs of a partial sex-atypical differentiation of the brain.

So, the brain is physiologically mismatched to the body at some point - whether at conception/birth or after can't be determined because they have to be old enough to self-report.   A consideration is that it might be easier in future to change the brain, than change the body.  Philosophically that opens a can of worms though doesn't it? Interesting..."
perth,39q7bt,Adzmodean,3,Sun Jun 14 02:13:11 2015 UTC,"A consideration is that it might be easier in future to change the brain, than change the body.   Really, it depends on what is easiest and what makes the person happiest.  Maybe in the future it will be easier to change the brain structure than the body, but if that still leads to some dysphoria then there's no point doing it.   Or, the structure of the brain is what makes them identify as the other gender.   The authors have just said that ""there's a little female brain structure in males with GD, and vice versa"", it's an absolutely massive jump to say ""GD is caused by different brain structure"".  What could happen in the nearer-future is the use of brain scans as a GD diagnostic tool."
perth,39q7bt,madmooseman,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:19:36 2015 UTC,"an absolutely massive jump to say ""GD is caused by different brain structure"".   I don't think it is. It's the only reasonable conclusion from many studies that have show differences in structure and connectivity in people with gender dysphoria. We see it with conditions like body dysphora - it is 100% due to atypical neural organisation, which makes sense when you think about it. Psychological concepts like identity are inextricably linked to neural architecture. We're at the point where we can say the same thing for gender dysphoria."
perth,39q7bt,Chief_White_Halfoat5,2,Sun Jun 14 03:54:52 2015 UTC,it might be easier in future to change the brain   I seriously doubt that. The brain is orders of magnitude more complex.

I'm not in biological sciences, but I read the thing okay. The last couple of lines is there conclusion. That is, most people have the right head to what they were born with, and there are a couple of slight, small, variances in those who identify as trans to a slight sexuality differentiation. It doesn't say they're similar to the gender they identify with, if I understood correctly. The journal article was very technical and difficult to read.  However, there is concern about post-op health. Eg, Guardian reported there were concerns.   Actually, this little piece of work I found interesting; http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4463"
perth,39q7bt,tatty000,2,Sun Jun 14 04:26:16 2015 UTC,"This may just be anecdotal, but as a trans person who is post-op for a little over 2 years now, I would have to say that my life has been improved immeasurably by surgery.   I'd say the main issue is that people think surgery and transition in general is the magic bullet to solve every problem in their life. For me, it was my major hurdle in life, however many other trans people have a lot of other issues to deal with. There are other studies (can't remember which ones at the moment, just remember reading them) that state the main problems are with familial and societal acceptance. This is slowly getting better, but still has a long way to go."
perth,39q7bt,GeekToGirl,2,Tue Jun 16 02:46:39 2015 UTC,"I read a couple articles how post-op they had a lot of flattering, praise, joy, and general societal support for what they'd done; but once the lights started to dim they started to feel much more down and regretting their decision. It was exactly science, but still an article (I'll have to find it another day). I'm not arguing for or against, but I enjoy playing DA.  But good to know you're happy! I'd be interested to know how the full process looked like in WA/Perth? What elements to the procedure happened? Does Medicare cover it (or part?)? What therapy etc happens? How does the whole hormonal treatment thing work?"
perth,39q7bt,tatty000,3,Tue Jun 16 03:17:43 2015 UTC,"My main problem was finding a doctor who had any knowledge at all on the matter. I had shopped around quite a bit before ending up self medicating using research from the net on what was best (I imported meds from various online stores).  I ended up getting an appointment with the only psychiatrist in WA at the time who dealt with this kind of thing and he had a 5 month waiting list. So it wasn't until I was around 6 months in that I actually got a script for my meds.  After seeing the psych twice, he said he thought there was no reason to see him again until I needed approval for any procedure. These two visits were essentially to see whether there were other underlying issues that needed to be dealt with.  Medicare covers next to nothing in this. I got the standard rebate back for psych and doctor visits, but that's all. About a year into my transition, I found out that I may be able to use my superannuation for surgery. I had just enough in there to pay for one of the best surgeons in the world. Of course, there are no decent surgeons in Australia for this kind of thing, so I went to Thailand.  Hormones before surgery consisted of an anti-androgen to block testosterone and an estrogen. Essentially the combination switches your hormonal make up and forces bodily changes to occur. This includes things like breast growth, softening of features, etc. Voice and facial hair are not affected, however. The voice was really difficult to train and facial hair takes a lot of painful procedures like laser and electrolysis.  After surgery, there is no testosterone to block, so now I'm just on estrogen. I need to stay on this for the rest of my life because my body no longer produces any sex hormones."
perth,39q7bt,GeekToGirl,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:31:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the response.  Self medicating, as in hormonal stuff? Or other? Where were you able to import from, and was there any custom issues?  Why did you need approval for procedure if you were going to Thailand? Was there any other issues? What ratio of people actually are recognised as trans (is there a standardised format?) compared to those who say they ae?  How badly out of pocket was it? Does any private health insurance cover any of it? What would you change about the whole process and procedure if you could go back in time?  Interesting on hormones bit. So facial hair has eventually stopped? I thought hormonal treatment stopped facial hair, or does it restrict it at all?  i have so many more questions, but I'm not sure where to draw the line..."
perth,39q7bt,tatty000,2,Tue Jun 16 09:34:26 2015 UTC,"I don't mind answering questions, I know people are curious. We're pretty much the awesome new thing right now.  I self medicated hormones (and blockers) only. And only after doing a lot of research into what doses and meds were the best for the job. I ended up getting it spot on. I ordered from a site based in Vanuatu, no customs issues at all. However, each package did include a ""prescription"" just printed on a piece of paper.  Worldwide regulations require a psychiatrist to sign off on full genital surgery. My surgeon required two psychiatrists, so I had to sit with one in Thailand for about 5 mins for a chat, then he approved me. I'd say the vast, vast majority of those who self declare as trans are actually trans. It's not something people want to be. The feelings of dysphoria are debilitating and lead many to drug abuse and destructive behaviour.   There's really no standardised format for this kind of thing. Everyone is different. I, however, was pretty much a textbook case.  I investigated private health a lot before starting this. Absolutely no fund covered anything at all. Everything I did, I paid for. The surgery itself was about $18k, plus airfares, accommodation, etc. It ended up being around $21k. I was able to get the money from my superannuation to cover it though.  Facial hair didn't eventually stop. It needed to be utterly killed. Electrolysis, laser, etc. Hormones do absolutely nothing to stop facial hair.   As I said, feel free to fire away any more questions you'd like. Sorry I didn't respond earlier, was busy last night."
perth,39q7bt,GeekToGirl,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:53:13 2015 UTC,"Woah... that's some serious bank.  I guess the next questions are to do with the psychological side of things.  What kind of therapy and stuff did you pursue before the transition? When did you start (childhood?)? How many doctors did you see? What was their verdict? Did you jump from one to the other? Do you still need to see anyone?  What about friends and family? Did they accept it, or a bit hesistant? What does your current group of friends look like now? What about work life? What does your current relationships look like (ie, sexual, relational etc)?  I guess my last questions are; do you feel like a woman now, both physically and mentally? Are you happy? What was the hardest part? What was changing your name like? Is there anything you miss about being a male?"
perth,39q7bt,tatty000,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:08:57 2015 UTC,"As for therapy, I had a lot of issues when I was around 19. I attempted suicide and had to see a psychiatrist, but they had no idea about gender issues. Essentially, I jumped around from doctor to doctor, but they all knew nothing. I did have a psychiatrist as a child who I said I wanted to be a girl to, but he just didn't seem to care (I remember that one vividly). No doctor or therapist really helped with anything and I had to go it alone. I mentioned before that I had to see a psychiatrist for surgery approval and this is pretty much it. I didn't really need that much help with it all. I don't see any therapist or psychiatrist now.  When I was 19, I came out to my mother. She said she supported me, but secretly sabotaged any attempts I made at the time to do anything about it. This kind of thing was what triggered my suicide attempt. After I started transitioning on my own at 26 (I'm 30 next month now), however, my mother had come around. She apologised profusely and we're closer than ever now. She came along with me to Thailand for my operation. As for other family, all of my brothers (1 full brother, 4 step brothers, 3 half brothers) are fine with it, as well as my father. Friends, on the other hand, were not as nice. The vast majority of them just slowly stopped talking to me, stopped inviting me to things, etc.  Now days, I'm in a very happy relationship with my boyfriend. He knows everything about me and has absolutely no problem with it. I'd consider it just a normal, heterosexual relationship.  Work was perfectly fine with it. I came out about 3 months after starting my transition and they supported me through it. There were a few name issues and slip-ups at first, but now it's all fine.  I do feel like just any other woman now. My journey is pretty much complete. Of course, there's always the fact that I can never get pregnant and don't get a period, but pretty much everything else is there. By far, the hardest part was the voice. I still have troubles every now and then, but overall, it's a female voice now. That took me so long to master and now it's just a normal part of me.  Changing my name was a fairly easy process. Just go to the registry of births, deaths and marriages, fill out a form, give them money and they send you a certificate in the mail. To have my sex legally changed was a bit more of an ordeal, including going before a tribunal and waiting 28 days to give the Attorney General the right to appeal.  Probably the only thing I miss about being male was being able to pee on a tree or something and have it be socially acceptable. Other than that, nothing. I love being my true self and I'm really happy now days."

Its located acroas the road of the main entrance to perth railway station, youll know it when you see it. northbridge, West Perth, and Leederville are the more popular night spot areas. As another person wrote stay away from late night rockingham, Especially Liquids Night club. trains finish at mid night. However on friday and saturday nights, late services run at 1 and 2 am from Perth station outward. However the last train to thornlie station leaves at 11.50pm. Most bus routes operate run until 6pm, others run until 9pm and gradually close until midnight.  In the downtown/cbd/city there is a free travel zone on all buses called FTZ. We also have a Cat bus that also does this, just look for the bus with a large cat stickered on it. If you miss some murican cuisine, 50 States Foodmart sell most of the reeces pieces range (oreos, ice cream topping, cereal, pb&j mix etc); Funyion rings; spray cheese; and most other US stuff. They can allso order in some stock if you want. you mentioned Duel Citizen. If its an Aus citizenship I suggest going to apply for the government medicare card as soon as possible.  this also for a tax file number as you will be deducted 50% of your pay if you choose to work without it. Edit. Forgot to mention upon your arrival to make your way to the foreshore  to present a sacrafice to Old Bertie so he wont devour you on feeding day. A cat should suffice."

I arrived almost two years ago and am finishing up at ECU.    you can port your American license over, however if you got it less then two years ago you will be given a restricted license. With p-plates.  Transperth is OK, however wait times can be annoying and the fairs for nonuni students are high. If you do take transperth get a smartridder and have it auto reload for a discount.  Cabs are expensive , uber is a great alternative.  Things close early, like 5pm early.  Although this is slowly changing. Thursday is late night shopping day.  For fun northbridge is really nice, I don't go clubbing my self.  But there are some nice restaurants and bars I have visited.   Shopping, their is a big department store called Myer. Their is once in the city and another in lakeside Joondalup. Lots of little stores in the city.  The biggest mall is Lakeside Joondalup which is just finishing up being renovated.  Being 18 you can go to bar and clubs easy, bring a passport or better yet get an Australian drivers license.  File for a taxfile number (like a social security number)  Open a local bank account, I use bankwest but it might be best to go with what your relatives use.  Be prepared for a price difference, although the aud is weaker now so your American money will go further then when I got here. But something here are more than double the US price.  Luckily the minimum wages here are high and it kind of counteracts the prices.  Although it still kind of feels like i am being ripped off.  Try meetup.com, for finding groups of people interested in meeting others.  I tried it once and had a blast.  Although my close friends I met at uni.

perth,39kgvt,StankPlanksYoutube,22,Sat Jun 13 18:00:49 2015 UTC,Maybe you should go to the Greens website and actually read their policies. You're complaining about a cartoon boogyman version that the Liberals and the media have created to scare people into voting right wing.
perth,39knnq,mrsboombastic,56,Fri Jun 12 11:48:12 2015 UTC,I honestly think it's a mix of terrible luck and not knowing local knowledge.  The William Street McDonalds for example isn't a place I would ideally choose for lunch.
perth,39knnq,x0rms,19,Fri Jun 12 12:01:58 2015 UTC,Agreed. I live and work in the city and I always avoid William St on the Maccas side between Murray and Hay. There are shitheads there from 7am scabbing money and generally being cunts.
perth,39knnq,x0rms,5,Fri Jun 12 12:08:45 2015 UTC,We looked at an apartment on Murray when we first got here... we almost took it until walked our shopping back to our hotel through there. There were plenty of scabs in the daylight too.
perth,39knnq,MrWhippie,4,Fri Jun 12 12:29:34 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out too that you've got some nice options just outside the CBD, like Beaufort street strip in Mt Lawley, Northbridge (nice in the day, can be rough on weekend nights), and Leederville."
perth,39knnq,MikeAppleTree,2,Sat Jun 13 02:10:34 2015 UTC,"Thats the city for you. People trip over themselves trying to live in or as close as possible to this place and even wear it as a badge of honour. I live 15 to 20 mins out of the city and usually cop abuse from my ""friends"" for living where i do. Dunno why though. Its awesome here and peaceful as fuck. These same people ask me later on what i do when i find junkies passed out in my driveway..... Ummm I dont know cos I've never experienced that in all my life being born and raised in perth.   I DO work in perth CBD though. And i see that shit almost daily and it fuckin shits me. Remind me of why people aspire to live there please? Im genuinely curious cos to me its a fuckin shithole. You work in the CBD not live there.   I think you were def unlucky though. Thats some shit for a short amount of time. My advice... if you plan on living in the city get used to that shit. If you don't wanna get used to that shit? Move to the suburbs..... of perth that is. Not those ones this side of geraldton. Thats not perth."

perth,39knnq,Scientist_girl_,23,Fri Jun 12 22:17:45 2015 UTC,"It's not always like that, but you might want to get away from the CBD a bit.   A bit of advice, stay away from fast food in the city, it attracts the worst, and I meant the worst that Perth has to offer."
perth,39knnq,EhtEmag,3,Fri Jun 12 12:09:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) We're in East Perth but we've been exploring the burbs on weekends, there's some really cool spots further out."
perth,39knnq,AustENTation,5,Fri Jun 12 12:33:46 2015 UTC,"There are some lovely places scattered all around perth. King's Park is probably the closest place I recommend visiting, especially in wildflower season, which we're coming into now.  Araluen Botanical Park is another nice place to visit at this time of year. The Swan Valley has great wineries and restaurants.  Fremantle is a shadow of its former self, but it's still nice to go there on a weekend for a feed.  For shopping, I avoid the city centre and either go to Garden City Booragoon, Galleria Morley or Lakeside Joondalup for big experiences.   Perth Zoo is a place you should visit, and the South Perth/Como region around it is great for bars, cafes and restaurants. Subiaco has some nice places to eat as well.   I can give you more ideas on where to go, depending on what you're interested in. For everyday local things in the CBD someone else will have to give you a guide."
perth,39knnq,dojoca,3,Fri Jun 12 12:56:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, some good tips there :)  We did King's Park pretty much first up and absolutely love it there. It inspired us to jump on the bike bandwagon :P   We're big on the vino so planning a trip down south soon... actually any wine bars we would love! We really liked Freo but haven't explored it too much mainly went to the docks for a look around the checked out a few of the old buildings.   We're pretty nerdy, My Partner is a Web Developer and I work in digital too but we're really keen on outdoorsy stuff. We've been going for bike rides along the water when we can and are hoping to go to Rottnest Is on the weekend. Anything artsy and a bit out of the norm is up our alley but we're pretty much open to anything. Also would love a place to buy some lasting fresh fruit and veg!"
perth,39knnq,skunkybooms,2,Fri Jun 12 13:34:40 2015 UTC,For fruit & veggies go to the Subiaco market on saturday morning. Better quality and much cheaper than woolies or coles. Don't know when they are closing tho it's been a while I haven't gone there.
perth,39knnq,x0rms,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:34:28 2015 UTC,Great will check that out thank you!

perth,39knnq,teleportingpantaloon,23,Fri Jun 12 23:55:05 2015 UTC,What places are you going to?! This sounds like extraordinarily bad luck or extraordinarily poor choices of places to frequent.
perth,39knnq,collectiveindividual,3,Fri Jun 12 11:58:37 2015 UTC,"I think the place was called Wolf Lane? That's where the guy tried to mug us. It wasn't super late at night either. The food steal was on William St, we were coming back from a concert and stopped to get some kebabs. Also there's an amazing curry place called City Heart in the city too - we had a guy try to start us outside there also! About 5 minutes earlier we saw another guy try to brawl a shop attendant in the IGA near there."
perth,39knnq,RonIsIZe_13,15,Fri Jun 12 12:21:03 2015 UTC,"Apart from the William St stuff, I honestly think you've had some tremendously bad luck!  Wolf Lane is safe enough in my opinion.  Pier St (City Heart) and the IGA near there are further away from what I'd call the social area of the CBD, so I can't judge it too much, but honestly I have been there at least a dozen times before and never seen trouble letalone had any myself!  Let /r/perth take ya'll out one night!"
perth,39knnq,lmzowot,2,Fri Jun 12 12:23:53 2015 UTC,Sounds good we're keen to meet some new people! I do hope it's just bad luck as we've got high hopes for this move :)
perth,39knnq,RonIsIZe_13,9,Fri Jun 12 12:37:09 2015 UTC,"Bloody hell. I guess my next question is whether you both look like brawlers?!   Avoid William Street eateries, there's generally ne'er-do-wells hanging around there.   The Wolf Lane incident surprises me, but I guess such things can happen anywhere."
perth,39knnq,henry82,4,Fri Jun 12 12:26:02 2015 UTC,"Nah we're both pretty tiny. My partner's definitely not a fighter either, he's actually pretty shy.   Yeah it was a shame as we loved Wolf Lane but we haven't been back since. We discovered Bobeche on the weekend though so have been hiding out there, the staff rule!"
perth,39knnq,slymaniac,2,Fri Jun 12 12:41:23 2015 UTC,"Glad you've found a non-muggy place :/ There's a few decent options in Brookfield Place, you will likely find another place there you enjoy. Can recommend Choo Choos bar on Wed nights, especially when ribs and whiskey sours are on offer.   Some good spots over the bridge too - Lot 20 and The Standard, for instance.   The city is a lot more vibrant in the warmer months, peaking around Fringe time of year. Did you get to any of the free State of the Art music festival in the Cultural Centre over the long weekend? Revelation Film Festival also starts soon.   Hopefully this all means you've already ticked off your share of crime statistics for your lives here. Your experience thus far really isn't usual, we promise."
perth,39knnq,nahcoob,3,Fri Jun 12 13:01:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip on the film fest will definitely check that out! I work a late shift on week nights so was bummed to see most of the trivia nights and quirky stuff is hosted during the week here. We're doing Gov Hack in a few weeks and one of the planetarium late nights coming up.   Whiskey sours are up our alley though so will definitely give Choo Choos a try. We're after a good blues or rockabilly hangout too if there is one.
perth,39knnq,dojoca,2,Fri Jun 12 13:26:58 2015 UTC,"The Perth Blues Club plays at the Charles Hotel on Tuesday nights (not the kind of pub I'd recommend as your local, but a decent spot to see bands of a certain vintage). Pretty sure the Mustang Bar has rockabilly nights, so have a look at their website.   Sadly we've just lost some great local music venues. A few months ago I'd recommend you get to Deville's Pad too.   I hadn't heard about Gov Hack, thanks, sounds like a surprisingly good initiative."
perth,39knnq,Scientist_girl_,3,Fri Jun 12 14:11:59 2015 UTC,Thanks will check those out too! There's a pretty good tech  / start up scene here from what we've seen so should be fun :)

perth,39knnq,lettis,3,Fri Jun 12 13:20:20 2015 UTC,"You two aren't giving these people eye contact or trying to talk to them at all I assume? I only ask because a lot of people do somehow provoke the interest of these types through trying to talk to them or making eye contact with them when that's the last thing that you should do. Sounds like horrendous luck, albeit the thing at the William St McDonalds doesn't surprise me, it's a zoo even during the day and the toilets are locked up/they refuse entry to almost everyone trying to use them for obvious reasons.  Perth definitely has that aspect of seediness/undesirables/drunks in certain street areas... William between Murray and Hay, and then Murray between Barrack and Pier are probably the worst. Definitely more noticeable then most other Australian cities IMO (they don't tend to be on display as much elsewhere in heavily trafficked spots).  Hopefully you have gotten the very worst out of the way early and you encounter some better luck from now! :)"
perth,39knnq,6208,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:08:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip! We're both pretty shy people so starting fights isn't something we're keen on :)

perth,39knnq,brenman,3,Fri Jun 12 23:58:12 2015 UTC,"I think you've had an awful amount of bad luck. We used to live on Adelaide Tce on a 4th floor facing the street when we first arrived (a bit more than a year ago). Nights were awful, heaps of drunks, druggies and crazy people screaming on the streets. But besides that nothing ever happened to us and we only walked around cause we didn't have a car then, and we walked a lot at night even on the sides of Wellington square when we visited some friends that lived on Bronte st (tip here, try to avoid that park at all times if you can). After 5 months on noisy sleepless nights we moved across the river to South Perth. Lovely suburb, close to the city so you have a $20 cab fare to pretty much any bar in town but not close enough to have to put up with daily crap. I guess you guys have already picked an apartment, but when your lease expires you can consider moving a little further from the city. It gets better I promise :)"
perth,39knnq,DogSlut,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:48:39 2015 UTC,"We're near Adelaide Tce, I love our apartment block but you're right about the druggies and the screamers! Fortunately I'm a heavy sleeper and our place is pretty secure :)"
perth,39knnq,weaselsandflags,3,Fri Jun 12 16:11:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, basically agreeing with what everyone else is saying. Just really bad luck.   Once you start making some friends and go out with them, you will pick up the places to avoid.  I've been to wolf lane a few times, actually suprised someone tried to mug you there. I've also been to the maccas and hungry jacks in the city and am not suprised shit happened there. Never go there, day or night.  You guys must just look like easy targets, maybe if your partner is short and scrawny. No offense obviously, but maybe the druggies, homeless and abos can see you guys are vulnerable.  If they look at you by the way just ignore them and don't make eye contact otherwise they will start yelling and try to start shit. Remember they are cowards so they won't start fights if they are either outnumbered or out manned (usually won't start a fight on a guy bigger bulk wise or height)  Good luck, and i really hope your luck changes. Perth is a nice city to live in, but like all cities there are shitty areas and shitty people."

perth,39knnq,henry82,3,Sun Jun 14 03:58:13 2015 UTC,"I wonder if moving makes you more susceptible to this somehow. I lived in Perth for 2 years and had 2 incidents - a drunk guy once got agro with me in a bus shelter demanding he could have the seat and another guy once lunged at me when I was riding my bike on the south Perth foreshore.   Now that I'm in Melbourne I get begged from by meth heads in the city all the time, people smoking on me all the time, the amount of crazy/high fuckers on public transport is insane.   Perth is lovely... Although to be fair, William street is probably best avoided."
perth,39knnq,freoted,3,Fri Jun 12 23:51:42 2015 UTC,"Yes that area around Hay and Murray street with the fast food places is just feral 24/7. Try the David Jones food hall during the day, none of the riff raff down there and heaps of amazing food."

It's quiet and unpopulated providing you don't mind trains a couple of times a night.  Your other option would be a caravan park.. Lake Navarino has some really nice grass with fire pits, but these sorts of parks aren't exactly quiet. Usually in these styles of parks, you don't have a lot of room. However it's the low season at the moment, so there shouldn't be many people camping unless it's the school holidays/long weekend  if you can extend your distance limitations, you can find some nice little spots along the collie river, or the camp grounds by wellington dam.

I still said that was disgusting for a car with that low kilometres on it but if you give me a good deal on a car I might. I did get a good deal on a vehicle, paid for it then they refused to give me the car saying they sold it to somebody else over the phone whilst I was haggling prices.

Colleague was called there once for a woman reporting to police that the sales people had her car and were refusing to let her leave the room until she bought a car. I know they were also reported to police for hassling people at the bus-stops on the assumption that they needed a car.
perth,39ks36,mr30h7,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:03:58 2015 UTC,"This was only a few months ago and everything you have put I felt, I wanted a vehicle anyway so there was no need to put the hard sale on me. They were trying to be intimidating. I did notice once they took my keys, they looked like they had no intention of giving them back. Yes I could have asked but, personally I was not bothered at the time but I could see how others would be intimidated by how they keep trying to dominate customers and tell you to buy a car now. I was bullied about how little earnings they thought I had for not buying a car for cash. Actual sentence ""Come on, what the hell is going on here, how can a single guy, with no mortgage, not be able to afford a car"" with 2 sales guys laughing at me for it. I knew they were baiting me so didn't bite. They had a sale before I walked in, I wanted a vehicle, I did not need to be persuaded. Their attitude actually made me think was this the right choice. If they were more friendly and just said hey no worries it will be here tomorrow, I would not have haggled so much. In the end because they kept on trying to strong arm me I kept arguing the prices and seems like maybe they could not let the vehicle go for that price in the end. It put me off getting a vehicle now anyway and I am keeping my car since it does have low KM and renovating my house instead."
perth,39ks36,Untimely_Manner,2,Sat Jun 13 04:38:30 2015 UTC,"I was at Morley Toyota and they were looking at my car to asses it as a trade in,  fair enough, but when they were done they wouldn't give them back, they said we have your car out the back will bring it round the front when you are ready to leave, so we need the keys, kinda dick move and would never go back to them now for pulling that shit."
perth,39ks36,Maurice_M0ss,3,Sat Jun 13 14:16:54 2015 UTC,"The Honda dealer on Scarborough Beach Rd did the same thing to me. It must be a regular tactic to keep the keys to pressure the client. He'd taken the keys on the pretence of assessing the trade in value, they just drive it round the back of the office but then wouldn't tell me what the price difference would be unless I told him I was prepared to buy the car on offer. I told him that if he didn't give the keys back to me immediately I would call the police and would be making a complaint."
perth,39ks36,Untimely_Manner,2,Sun Jun 14 06:18:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I got the impression, that something similar would have happened to me, never tested it out as I was there to buy a car so didn't care at the time they had my keys, though I definatly noticed that he didn't give them back and it made me wonder why and is this a intimidation tactic? Because with anything, if I borrow a persons phone or whatever small object that is not mine I would give it back when I have finished with it. Why would I be keeping somebody elses property. Plus it seems it happens way to much to be a simple mistake it is obviously a tactic they use to make you feel you have to stay there."

perth,39ks36,The_Valar,2,Sun Jun 14 06:07:15 2015 UTC,The new car and the trade in should have been on the same contract so if the new car fell through the whole thing should have been off. Sounds like they just wanted your trade in.
perth,39ks36,Untimely_Manner,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:00:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah it did eventually, it was just I had no idea, it was as they were closing for the evening they pretty much walked off and wanted me out of there. After awhile they realised I was still there so asked why. I said because I don't even have my own car. So they went to get my old car keys so I could take my car, took about a week to get my money back. I had no guarantee my old car was mine as I never saw that paperwork I signed again as they said they had shredded it. I have a feeling 2 things happened. They wanted my car cheap and I think I got too good a deal on the vehicle I wanted to buy and somebody higher up told the sales assistant no after he had made the deal. I could have argued that I had already paid and signed but I was umming and ahhing anyway as to if I had made a good decision so getting my money back eventually I was ok with."

My advice is 100% to go to Como. It is about a 10 minute drive to the city and something like only $20 by Taxi. It is close to South Perth and Karawara which both have amazing restaurants. Como is close to the Mount Pleasant IGA which is small but amazing for the best fruit, but also close to the Karawara IGA which is the best supermarket I have ever been to. Also the Karawara shopping centre and it's restaurants including Hippo Creek is brand new and amazing. It is also a fairly short drive to the Vic Park restaurant strip. It is also about a 20 minute drive to the beach. It is also right in the middle of where you both need to go everyday.  You are right about Wilson. There is nothing there. It is close to the Karawara shopping centre, but that's about it. Sort of close to Carousel but I wouldn't rate that too highly. You will never bother going to the city or the beach because they will feel just that little bit too far.  Willagee is fairly suburban, and all it's going for it is it's close to the beach and sort of closish to Fremantle. But you will feel isolated from most people. Everything (besides freo) will be a minimum 30 minute drive. You will end up stuck at home for the most part.  Buy the old villa and make it nice. You can upgrade certain parts of it slowly if you want to. That land is never going to devalue because it's so central. As Perth gets more and more widespread, central locations are always going to be sought after."

perth,39ewpl,jeffrey_smith,2,Sun Jun 14 12:45:51 2015 UTC,"Couple here, late 20s just moved into Wilson a year ago. I lived in Como with my parents before that and only just moved to Wilson. A lot of the other guys have posted pretty much the truth, Como is certainly the 'better' suburb' but also more expensive to live in (rates plus actual houses as you've said).   Both Como and Wilson are in the 'middle' of everything, but pretty boring suburbs themselves. Como has Vic Park, South Perth around it and quick access to the City, the East, the South many ways. It's a nice place to live, nice and quiet. Yes will have the NBN soon but Como will get the FTTN shit, South Perth FTTP - no idea why.   Wilson is pretty nice, a few shitty houses around but there's that in Como as well. If you look at Wilson from say Manning Road or Leach Highway you'd think its all shit inside but the main road houses are all rental filth. Wilson is in the middle of everything too. Karrawarra is close by to the North, you can get out onto Leach and out to Belmont quick, Caro quick, Riverton quick - getting to the freeway is a little harder (Manning Road is only North out). Wilson was right under a flight path but its moved recently and we rarely hear a plane now.   Both suburbs have nice parks and places to exercise. Rivers near both they are very similar suburbs, Como is probably what Wilson will be in 5-10 years.   (Eureka Chinese is the bomb tho)   But probably still with shit internet.   PM me if you have any specifics, 27 years in Como - 1 in Wilson :P"

Some bits are higher socioeconomic than others. The catch is that it's harder to get to the city from there than Wilson - but you have Freo nice and close by, so you win some, you lose some.  Wilson has some great running around the river, multiple viable routes to the city, biking distance to Curtin. Major disadvantage is that it's a bit annoying to loop around the river to get to Carousel. I've not heard about too much crime there - I'd have thought Willagee would be a bigger problem, actually.  I looked in Wilson before lucking out and finding something closer to the Freeway.  Of course, if you buy an unrenovated place in Como and are feeling handy, you'd be in a good position to make some bank..."

Willagee has a reputation of being low socio-economic but is definitely having a resurgence in the last 5 years and is becoming pretty popular with first home buyers and young couples.  Some pockets are really nice and safe but some have a high proportion of public housing (and associated problems), which is probably why the suburb is still so cheap.  It's getting there - little shopping villages like the one on Archibald St used to be sketchy but the old lunch bars and laundromats are being replaced by patisseries and coffee shops.  And the old primary school which had been vacant for years was knocked down and is now a pretty incredible park.  I doubt there would be much activity at night apart from Winnacott & Webber Reserves for team sports training (and in some pockets I wouldn't go walking the streets at night).  But you're pretty close to Freo which always has a lot going on at night.  FWIW, location-wise we absolutely love living in Palmyra, being 5-10 mins from the beach, the river, Freo, the freeway and Garden City.  Depending on which side of Willagee you're looking at you'd just add or subtract a couple minutes from that.  Hope that helps!"

The police have no way of intercepting text messages. Telcos can but the police need a very hard to get warrant to access them. The police can access general location data of a phone if it is a life threatening emergency, but that is expensive (billed by the relevant telco) and has to be authorised at a high level, a threat of suicide would get that authorisation.   It is possible that the number was accidentally altered when it was transferred to WA, or possibly a technical glitch on the telco side.

It's never going to be a massive airport full of fancy amenities and shopping because Perth Airport isn't even close to a Hub Airport like other big, fancy airports around the world - The only connecting flights people landing in this city are going to be going on is Intrastate flights to regional WA, and well you don't need much capacity as a hub for that. Considering how big airports are done in this country (mainly look at Sydney's, which is an utter shambles), it's probably for the better that Perth Airport is getting the type of expansion and renovation it's getting. If only they started about 5-10 years earlier though... >.<  It's a shame Qantas own the Domestic Terminal, otherwise they might have moved over during this airport expansion - instead they aren't planning to move out for 20+ years."

perth,398fyw,krisjorgensen,-8,Wed Jun 10 02:45:27 2015 UTC,"Never really understood why we need an airport train line.  Would YOU actually use a train line after a flight back to Perth that takes you into the city, and then you have to find a way home (more public transport and/or taxi). Would a tourist take a train into the city, to then catch a taxi rather than dragging their bags half a K or more to their hotel.  Would a backpacker use it, or just use the cheap bus direct to their hostel?  Generally if you have 2 people, taxi/uber is about the same price as an airport train and WAY more convenient.  I've experienced the white elephant Sydney airport line and it's just painful and gives you no reason to use it."

perth,398fyw,wurblefurtz,6,Wed Jun 10 05:39:25 2015 UTC,"Everytime we have travelled we've use the public transport to/from the Airport when possible.  I agree that there are other priorities, but I would use it and so would others.   Generally if you have 2 people, taxi/uber is about the same price as an airport train and WAY more convenient.   Can't comment on uber but last time it was a $50+ taxi fair for the three of us from Fremantle. Public transport (bus or train) has never been that pricy."
perth,398fyw,yagankiely,6,Wed Jun 10 06:56:54 2015 UTC,"Very dependent on how the proposed line is rolled out - from what is known about it, it'll be a regular line with a standard fare - unlike the Sydney airport line which is like, $15 to use. In which case, full fare for 2 people would be a 2 zone fare ($9, full fare, paper ticket for two people). When a cab/uber is going to be $40-50, and an airport shuttle bus is going to be $15-20.  As a tourist in other countries, if the airport public transport has been capable enough to deliver me to the city centre (Vancouver and its Skytrain is probably the best example to compare with Perth based around density - Obviously comparing something like Hong Kong's airport express isn't really valid considering how dense HK is) and is significantly cheaper then the cost of a taxi, I've used it.  My major concern with the concept of an Airport line is the fact that a fair chunk of our international flights arrive around 11pm - 2am since we don't have an airport curfew like other cities, meaning that unless it runs 24/7, it's going to be useless for at least 15% of international flights. and after the late night trains kerfuffle this year, there's pretty much zero chance that it'll run 24/7 >.<"
perth,398fyw,nahcoob,3,Wed Jun 10 05:18:15 2015 UTC,Yeh the Vancouver train line is amazing just took it a few months ago and it takes right into the city center.  But TIL about other cities having a curfew for flights.
perth,398fyw,aeonofeveau,2,Wed Jun 10 05:42:41 2015 UTC,Lots of airports have them worldwide. In Australia Sydney's is probably the most extensive (11pm - 6am).  I'd say the only reason Perth Airport doesn't have one is that until very recently many of the flight paths had minimal to no residential land under them.

In contrast, they're offering the lowest prices in a number of locations on the traditional price cycle start day (Thursday, bunch of Caltex stations are priced at 116.9 for unleaded tomorrow)  Always check fuelwatch though, there's always at least a few stations offering a good price 7 days a week.

perth,39ahu7,CaptainCa,5,Thu Jun 11 03:35:25 2015 UTC,"Sure. The fuelwatch website is suburb based, and not very reliable in my past experience. E.g. When I searched for Woodvale and surrounding suburbs, it'd miss the often cheaper locations in neighbouring Edgewater. It also means you need to know the name/postcode of the suburb you are in if you are out and about and need petrol.  What I've done is taken the data feed from fuelwatch, and tie each price to the GPS location of the petrol station. I use this to calculate how far each petrol station is from your current location, and return the list of prices within your chosen distance. It doesn't matter when you are in WA - I have prices for the entire state.  The page defaults to ULP within 5km, but you can save your own default, so you just open the page and within a couple of seconds you have the list of prices that are near you."

perth,399pr9,tatty000,4,Wed Jun 10 07:17:24 2015 UTC,"Salter Point.  Pros:   Location. Because Salter Point is built around the freeway, it's close to pretty much everything. It takes 10 minutes to get to the city and it takes the same amount of time to get to Osborne Park as it does to get to Cockburn Central (15 minutes). Very close to Canning Highway too, right next to Applecross and takes less than 10-15 minutes to reach either side of Canning Highway. Also 10 minutes from the city and good public transport as Canning Bridge station is only a couple of minutes away. It's not perfect though, it's rather difficult to get to Roe Highway, Midland (not that I ever need to go to Midland) and a few other places.  It's also peaceful as fuck. Everyone who lives here is over 65 so nothing hardly ever happens here. It has a whole bunch of incredible parks and of course the Salter Point peninsula is absolutely gorgeous. I love riding my bike around here late at night when there's no traffic. Also because it's so close to the river and natural wetlands, I wake up most mornings to birds and insects just doing their own thing.   Cons:  We live in the crappest house in Salter Point. My dad fucking hates this house with a passion. We'll be moving out at start of August. Not sure where to yet but it's very unlikely we can afford to live in Salter Point again. That's about it though, I love everything else about this suburb. Some mornings it can get fucking freezing because of the suburb's proximity to the river but that's about it. If you can afford it, I highly recommend living here."

Lacklustre roads and infrastructure. No cycle paths. Suburb has developed faster than council can manage. No-one's heard of the suburb and nothing to do in the evenings except eat

perth,394s12,clam_chips,23,Tue Jun 9 10:23:23 2015 UTC,It would be interesting to see the stats on how many people are injured/die from:   kids doing burnouts 'normal drivers' not paying attention (aka driving with their head up their arse) aged related decline in driving skills (and the lack of checking if they are still suitable to drive) drunk/drug driving sleep deprived driving   I would think burnouts are going to be at the very low end of the death/injury count.  So it seems the only reason to target that group is that it is popular with the general public.  24 cameras seems like a lot of money just to catch some kid doing burnouts.  I think I would prefer my taxes go towards real police not more cameras.  Real police do a far better job of enforcement and deterrence.

Getting woken up at 3am every weekend from the sound of someone doing donuts/burn outs, then the rancid smell of burnt rubber emanating into the house, it's not fun.  There are places where you can legally do burnouts all night for very little cost in a safe environment, it's called the Motorplex. The cunts who do it are just too retarded to figure that out."
perth,394s12,xyrgh,0,Tue Jun 9 12:17:05 2015 UTC,I'm not saying they shouldn't catch them.  I'm saying use real police to do it.  I doubt a camera will be placed at the end cul-de-sac so you're going to be relying on real police to get those guys.

These things are the main causes of deaths on the roads."
perth,394s12,MasterDefibrillator,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:41:43 2015 UTC,No doubt there is cross over but there are a whole lot of people that are just car enthusiasts and understand that what they are doing is not really endangering anyone. Drink driving is a whole different ballpark to doing some skids in a quiet street.

By definition, wouldn't being cross category mean it would count in all the categories in which it crosses? I.e. people who are in the hoons category, are often also in the drunk driving and bad decision making skills categories."
perth,394s12,MasterDefibrillator,-1,Tue Jun 9 12:48:02 2015 UTC,"total=sum(deaths)  hoon_total=sum(hoon_deaths)  drunk_total=sum(drunk_deaths)  hoon_percent=hoon_total/total*100.0  drunk_percent=drunk_total/total*100.0  If someone was both drinking and hooning they would +1 both the hoon total and the drunk total but not the overall total - so they would be in both categories (cross category)  I am aware analysis is more complex than I indicated but you have to start somewhere, you can't just throw your hands in the air :)"
perth,394s12,dzernumbrd,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:08:31 2015 UTC,"What's your point exactly? If you don't know what you're specifically looking for, then a specific statistical approach should not be used (this seems to me exactly what you are doing). How are you defining deaths for example? Is it all related deaths, or just people that cause the accidents. Without this kind of specific information, statistical analysis is useless and often misleading. Statistical analysis should be left to actual statistical data, with a specific goal in mind, without this It's worse than a ""hands in the air"" approach, as you put it.  The fact remains that if there is a large cross over, generally I would say that bad decision making is causally linked to hooning as it is drunk driving, etc. Of course I've got nothing to back me, that's just my base assumption. Given that, by targeting hoons, you're also generally targeting people with bad decision making skills etc. Statistics doesn't really come into it."
perth,394s12,MasterDefibrillator,0,Wed Jun 10 01:59:22 2015 UTC,That's exactly why I said I would like to see some stats.  As I do not believe your assumption (and the police minister's assumption) is correct.
perth,394s12,dzernumbrd,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:23:31 2015 UTC,"Right, well maybe lead with that next time, this isn't really the same thing ""The only assumption is that if it is cross category then it would count in both categories."" I understand what you mean now, but still don't see what relevance it has. All I ever wanted to say is that it seems likely that people who might cause injury and death from bad judgement, lack of responsibility etc, would also be categorised as hoons. So even if you are targeting hooning, which directly has a lower death/injury rate, it is likely you are at the same time reducing the deaths and injuries in other categories.  That's not the reason you asked for statistics though, you asked for statistics rhetorically to make a point that hooning doesn't account for nearly as many deaths as other things (of course that's how I interpreted it, but it seems pretty blatant). Not to see how much (if any) cross population there may be. These specific stats might be difficult to acquire.  Btw, I'm not the one downvoting you."

perth,394s12,poshy,2,Tue Jun 9 21:46:43 2015 UTC,"I think if you actually compared the cost of cameras to real live people, you'd be surprised at the difference.  People are expensive, best to use them for real crimes that you need to use your head to solve.  Cameras are best for deterrence in known problem areas, and if people go ahead anyways, it'll make for a quick court case with actual camera footage compared to a he-said-she-said police testimony."
perth,394s12,dzernumbrd,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:10:24 2015 UTC,"I already know the cameras are going to cost somewhere around $170k up front but you still need a bunch of FTEs to operate cameras and inspect the footage right?  The entire operation is going to cost a lot more than just the camera hardware.  I would still prefer more police officers given the response times to ""real crimes"" in WA are apparently terrible."
perth,394s12,poshy,3,Wed Jun 10 02:22:16 2015 UTC,"Given a police officer salary of 55K, the actual cost of employing them will be closer to 110K.  So the capital cost of these cameras is still less than 2 live police officers for 1 year of employment.    Reviewing footage and operations of the cameras, and maintenance per year will probably still fall under a single police officers cost of employment per year I bet.  Overall, I think this offers damn good value for money.  For something like hoons, you'd need incredibly quick response times to actually catch the perps in action (unlikely in a city of this size no matter the police force strenght) or spend the resources to literally have officers waiting around the known 24 locations."

From here, you want to continue down the kwinana freeway in to Harvey and check out the big orange. You can then check out Bunbury, Busselton and the surrounding towns like Dunsborough (there's a really good pizza place in bunbury called Bianco).  In all seriousness though probably spend some time in Northbridge, see the sights around town and drink your nights away at Mechanics institute/Ezra pound - This town can be tough if you don't know anyone so keep that in mind, people tend to be quite insular. Brisbane, like Perth has a lot of nice open spaces to walk around in and there isn't usually a huge ""scene"" going on. So a lot of that will depend on the weather in July, if it's good, you can go through King's Park and traverse the foreshore. If not, you're stuffed but our museums are kinda cool.

Unique to Thornlie is this really nice, huge park with massive trees etc which runs between entire streets, all the houses open into it from their backyards, some 70s concept suburb or something. It's completely hidden away from the road so easy to miss.  It's also very close to Albany highway and the Carousel shops so virtually all your amenities are really close to you.

Everytime you are given a task, finish it and then go find your boss and say ""What can I do for you now? ""    After you have cleaned up and put everything away.   Always be early.  Plan to arrive 15 minutes before you are scheduled to start, and sit in the parking lot and finish your coffee.  That way if you really are late,  they will cut you some slack.    THINK.

I'm guessing while they live in Fremantle, they probably go to Garden City for all their shopping... considering it's past as an alternative CBD from Perth, high-density should be a priority by far.  In contrast, I've noticed the City of Stirling has pushed through ambitious rezoning for a lot of suburbs in recent times without any visual public backlash.

Our population density is no where near as high as it should be, we've got 310 people for every square kilometre in the Greater Perth area. Cities with our population size in other areas of the world are anywhere from 5-20 times that much.  Philadelphia - 4,492.4 people per square kilometre.  Vienna - 4,326.1 people per square kilometre.  Hamburg - 2,300 people per square kilometre.  Perth - 310 people per square kilometre.  Spreading essential services out over such a massive area is bonkers, it's no wonder our roads and public transport are pushed to breaking point."

Metro Calgary - 237 people per square kilometre.  I could list another hundred US and Canadian cities like this.  Perth is growing in density -- against people's wishes. It's only because greenfield development is essentially banned (and what is allowed to occur is on tiny lots) that infill development is starting to happen. In Texas there are NO restrictions on development on the urban fringe, and thus cities in Texas like Houston are getting LESS dense, with lot sizes in new suburbs often about 2000m2."
perth,390n0r,Muzorra,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:08:04 2015 UTC,"Calgary   Doesn't seem like a terribly good comparison.  Three quarters of Calgary's metro population lives in the ""city"", however that's defined, with a density of 1,554.8/km sq.  Only tiny pin points in all of Perth reach that.  I'd wager the other examples go a similar way. Our definitions of 'city' and 'metro' are somewhat different. The amount of land area needed to scrape together Perth's population count generally blows the minds of planners.  Its a coreless place that defies general city development patterns.  Maybe it needs to, to some extent.  But people talk as though we can't have infill because of infrastructure problems.  You think spreading out more is going to aid that problem?"

And New Zealand..christ,  New Zealand's whole population is lower than Sydney.  We've probably got higher density than Timbuktu and most of Sub Saharan Africa while you're about it.  You didn't respond to my point.  All of your examples show much higher urban density than anywhere in Perth.  All show at least half of their metro population living at a density of over 1500 per kmsq and in two cases much higher than that, both in density and the percentage of the metro population living at that density.  Perth doesn't even approach this.  These are not honest comparisons."

Western Australia is bigger than NZ and has less people.   It's not because of densification policies. It's to make more money.   No, it's because nobody will buy a 1000m2 lot for $600,000, but that's what it costs the developer due to inflated land values.  New developments in Houston, Texas often have lots exceeding 2000m2 which cost less than $50,000. A 400m2 lot in Perth costs $300,000."

Firstly just want to point out that the main buyers of apartments would be young people as for obvious reasons standalone houses are attractive to families; and young people are the most likely to be working shift work when public transit is either unsafe, unreliable or completely unavailable.  In my case I start work at 4:30am. Usually I drive to work and it takes me around 5 minutes.  However, I just put my start address and workplace into Transperth's journey planner and it suggests it will take me a little over a hour to get to work (walk -> train -> bus -> walk) and the first train LEAVES at 5:17am so I'd be almost 2 hours late if I even got there without getting stabbed lol  FYI I don't live in Ellenbrook or Dawesville or anything this is all inner city Perth like 10km from the CBD.

If you force every 2 bedroom apartment to have more parking (which the owner doesn't necessarily need), the cost of new units will go up and people will be encouraged to drive more. If you instead place strict limits on street parking (charge for it/time limits) then people can't abuse it. Free parking everywhere shouldn't be a thing anyway, we will all end up paying for it through our council rates instead. If people want 2 cars, then they will have to buy an apartment with 2 parking spaces"

The council has pretty good public transport throughout, plenty of open space, lots of town centres and it is right next to the city - yet it only has a population density of 30 people per hectare. Really we have to make a choice between continuing to sprawl or densifying. Not everyone will be happy if we become denser, but it is far better than the alternative.  If you look at some of the compliants about densification though, they are crazy. In City Beach, which is less than 10kms from the city, they are opposing any changes to their current 1/4 acre blocks. There is plenty of space to add new dwellings whilst maintaining the character of the area, yet residents are going mad over a tiny change to the planning scheme - allowing a house to be built as two apartments (most houses in City Beach are massive and could easily fit 2 families, this just formalises it). By not allowing infill here, new houses must instead be built in new sprawling suburbs at the edge of Perth - the infrastructure for which costs the government a fortune. It just isn't realistic or fair for the rest of the city to support low density suburbs like City Beach."
perth,390n0r,raizhassan,8,Mon Jun 8 12:17:01 2015 UTC,All great points but too bad that those living in those suburb can come up with heaps of good reasons while infill is bad.  Actually all those points are just cover for 'no poor people in my suburb'.
perth,390n0r,aussielander,4,Mon Jun 8 13:03:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's completely true. The City Beach case is just awful. There are protests and facebook groups with people angrily trying to stop any change. The biggest issue I have is that the Town of Cambridge has worked really hard to produce a decent proposal and they still believe there is some conspiracy against them. They go on and on about how City Beach is the perfect ""garden suburb"" of Perth, when in fact most 1/4 acre blocks are all concrete and no trees. It is pretty clear that they just don't want people who can't afford a $1.5 million mansion to live near them. The council rightly points out that elderly couples who want to downsize have no options in City Beach and would have to move elsewhere, and yet community seems to think that is completely fine."

perth,390n0r,theenglishguy72,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:49:28 2015 UTC,"Did you read anything I wrote? Nowhere did I say that I wanted to ban families from living in detached homes. Perth has more detached homes than any other city of its size anywhere in the world, I am just saying that maybe we should have a bit more diversity?  Nearly everyone would like a detached house if they could, but for a lot of people they don't want to commute in heavy traffic from Butler to the city every day. Plenty of people I know would rather a townhouse near the city to a detached house in the middle of nowhere. The problem is in inner city areas like City Beach and the Town of Vincent local people won't allow this to happen.   It doesn't matter how big WA is, commuting long distances will always be undesirable for most people."
perth,390n0r,josh3234,-2,Thu Jun 11 10:35:48 2015 UTC,So we should decentralise jobs away from the CBD so people who live in outer suburbs don't have to commute so far.
perth,390n0r,theenglishguy72,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:07:53 2015 UTC,"Decentralising employment could work, but it isn't feasible or desirable for everyone to commute 30-40km every day. Our transport system isn't designed for it.  Fundamentally though, the issue is that low density housing is not a good thing. If you want a good idea of Perth in 50 years time if we continue to build single detached houses for everyone, then look at Phoenix. Arizona has loads of space so they let everyone have a single house and decentralised employment. Yet Phoenix is completely soulless and car dependent - just like some of our outer suburbs. That's a problem you can't fix unless you densify. Maybe you don't mind that, but most people in Perth do - I know that I prefer Fremantle and Mount Lawley to soulless shopping centres in Clarkson"
perth,390n0r,josh3234,0,Thu Jun 11 11:49:35 2015 UTC,"""Soulless"" is subjective. I personally love suburbs with massive blocks, lots of trees, lots of parkland, and massive roads. It looks aesthetically good to me and is very convenient. Melbourne has more than double Perth's population with average commutes only a few minutes higher. How do you think that works? It's not like they got to 2 million people and decided ""hey, we're too big, we have to make everyone live in a communist-style dogbox now"". Nope, they kept building out until density became trendy (year 2000 or so) and THEN started claiming it was impossible to build out any more.  The problem with Perth's out suburbs is that they are too compact. Make the average block 10 times bigger, so they're half an acre each like in parts of Atlanta, and plant a fuck load more trees.  Here's an example of a very affordable  and normal suburb in inner Atlanta, near the CBD.  https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Atlanta,+GA,+USA/@33.733986,-84.479578,3a,75y,198.02h,73.01t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sODj_1bkgN1mKu0n-UeSs1A!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x88f5045d6993098d:0x66fede2f990b630b!6m1!1e1  Homes there cost about $100,000 each on average."
perth,390n0r,theenglishguy72,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:07:40 2015 UTC,"When I said soulless I meant Perth outer suburbs like Butler and Ellenbrook where the house takes up most of the whole block, there are very few trees and no one knows their neighbour. I'm sure you'd agree that we can't keep building houses like this.   The reason why high density living it has started to become ""trendy"" now in Melbourne and Perth is not because of the population size, but because many people now no longer want to live 40kms+ from the CBD. Many don't identify with their parent's desire for a 1/4 acre block in suburbia and are happy to live in a small apartment if it means they are in a good neighbourhood with a short commute at an affordable price. No one is forcing them to do this, the government may be actively encouraging high density living because it saves them money, but it certainly isn't restricting the amount of land available in outer suburbs. You also have to remember that 90% of existing properties are already single houses, that isn't going to change any time soon - if you don't want to move house no one is going to force you.  The issue is that land values will always be higher in more desirable areas (close to the city/beach, low crime, good schools etc). It would never be possible for the 2 million or so people who are projected to move into Perth in the next 50 years to all live on a 1/2 acre blocks whilst having reasonable commute times. The city would have to triple in physical size - it would be financially impossible for the government to provide the infrastructure to service all of this.  I also had a look at your example of a house in Atlanta and it seemed pretty nice - green, large blocks, 10kms from downtown and surprisingly cheap. I don't know much about Atlanta but it seemed way too good to be true. The problem is this isn't a ""normal"" suburb. Reading through /r/Atlanta everyone mentioned how dangerous the west side of the city is in comparison to the east. I'm not sure if crime is a problem on the particular street you linked me, but it is surrounded by suburbs that are. If you look at a similar property on the east/north side it is 5-6 times the price, nearly double the median house price. Any reasonable person who wants a safe, affordable house on a large block like this would have to live 25 miles+ from downtown.   I could go on and on about the benefits of high density living and the downfalls of sprawl, but I think you should realise that providing more types of housing will benefit everyone. If you want a 1/2 acre block with trees, you can live in the hills. Commute times will be longer than average and it might cost you a bit more - however it will be prettier than the rest of Perth. On the other hand, plenty of people would rather a shorter commute, more community activities and a smaller house for the same price. Different people with different priorities should have different types of houses"
perth,390n0r,Muzorra,0,Thu Jun 11 16:30:12 2015 UTC,"When I said soulless I meant Perth outer suburbs like Butler and Ellenbrook where the house takes up most of the whole block, there are very few trees and no one knows their neighbour. I'm sure you'd agree that we can't keep building houses like this.   I agree we shouldn't, but the answer isn't building more dog boxes or cramped row houses. It's abolishing zoning laws for all undeveloped areas so blocks can be bigger. It's mandating some park land and urban landscaping before homes are sold.   but because many people now no longer want to live 40kms+ from the CBD   People don't just randomly decide they want different things. It's because the cost of living in such a location has changed. There are no longer as many jobs in the suburbs as they have started to centralise back in the CBD. This is caused by not enough zoning for industrial land in outer areas. Also, blocks are a lot more expensive and a lot smaller. A quarter-acre block in the outer areas could be bought for about $30,000 (in today's dollars) in the 1980s, now it's more like $400,000 and $250,000 for a 400m2 block.   The problem is this isn't a ""normal"" suburb.   It's relatively normal, a little on the cheap size. Median home prices in Atlanta usually sit around $150,000. A home right next to the CBD on a massive (and I do mean massive -- 1 acre +) lot and in a low-ish crime area (in the US this means 80% + white) will cost around $500,000. The same home in any big Australian cities would cost five times as much. Atlanta is known as ""the city in a forrest"", because it is. Even right next to the CBD you have 1 acre + blocks and huge amounts of trees and greenery. This is unheard of in Australia, can you imagine the cries if the area immediately around the Sydney CBD wasn't tiny dog box apartments and cramped row houses?   Different people with different priorities should have different types of houses   No argument from me. The problem is forcing people in to various types of housing. We need to follow the Texas/Atlanta model and deregulate development on the fringes of our cities to make housing everywhere more affordable. This will even make apartments far more affordable, because land prices will go down. You can get a really nice apartment in a trendy area of Houston, TX for $200,000, where it would cost $400,000 + in Perth."
perth,390n0r,lordsnipe,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:08:08 2015 UTC,"This really is more a discussion over whether development and planning should be regulated or not.   Regarding affordability, I know Demographia spend a lot of time/money producing a report each year on the relationship between the strength of planning regulations and the cost of housing.  It is clearly biased with the owner using it to backup his beliefs, however it does provide some interesting data. There is generally a difference in average house prices between cities that have strong planning regulations and those that don't (in American cities at least). However that does not necessarily mean that one causes the other. The Western Australian government heavily regulates new developments, but that doesn't mean there isn't enough supply to meet demand. Years before the demand is there the government releases land. If people want a large block then there are plenty of cheap sites around Gin Gin, Toodyay and Wooloroo. Most people don't want to commute that far though, which is why prices in the city are expensive. No matter how large the supply of lands is, the convenience of getting to/from it is fixed.   Many economists also say that the price of housing is more a result of the high desirability of a city than the strength of planning regulations. Say the Californian government were to remove all development restraints around San Francisco, the price of houses aren't going to dramatically fall. It could also be argued that planning regulations help to make cities desirable. Atlanta might be aesthetically pleasing with its trees, however it is desirable as a place to live and work? I haven't been there so can't judge that, but I'd guess that because unemployment is relatively high, it is highly car dependent and there is little street level activity (because it is low density) it probably isn't. The same goes for other cheap cities in America like Detroit or Cleveland. If the average house price in New York is 3 times that of Atlanta, why don't all New Yorker move to Atlanta? - because New York is more desirable. Same can be said for Perth."

I can honestly say, Rockingham is great, if you just want an average suburban life. The beaches are great, you can ride your bike without getting doored or hit by a car, even the commute to Perth is easier than say anything graham farmer/orong rd direction.   The downsides are, the council is rediculously backwards, caters to families only, so if you're young (18-29) there is very little in the way of amenities for you, the foreshore strip has mostly restaurants and some small bars, nothing great though.  It gets a bad rap due to it being a cheaper area, more families buy here and thus lots of kids, meaning some graffiti here and there, maybe some violence in homes west areas. But still less than anything in the city.  Public transport isn't that bad here either, I have 3 buses that run near my house."

perth,3916y2,foxsss,6,Mon Jun 8 14:32:18 2015 UTC,"I have a few friends in the Ellenbrook area. Like any place, there are pros and cons to it. It is a very good place for raising a family, there are plenty of schools, it's relatively safe, plenty of parks and such. There are a fair amount of amenities in Ellenbrook, so you don't need to travel often. And the Swan Valley is right there when you want to get out of the house.  Downsides appear as soon as something isn't in Ellenbrook. It's about 20 minutes from pretty much anything else, so it's a decent drive if you can't find it local. You will pretty much have to drive as well. There is public transport, but it's not great. It'll do in a pinch, but not really something you want to rely on. I know traffic in and out in the mornings used to be pretty bad, but that was a few years ago. I think they've put in some more exits, so it might have improved.  Another major thing I'd look into is how well your house will hold it's value. A lot of the houses that are built in Ellenbrook are part of house-and-land packages that don't tend to be built to a particularly great quality. Additionally, there are always new houses being built which keeps the price down. You might not get the equity you're expecting from a house here. (Then again, you might. It's worth checking into.)"
perth,3916y2,Boramere,2,Mon Jun 8 15:02:11 2015 UTC,"I would also be concerned about long term land value.  Ellenbrook is a long way from everywhere else - to get there you drive through 5km of bush - and it isn't near the beach which is the primary price driver for a lot of the northern sprawl.  If Perth does end up transitioning towards building up rather than out, you may not see a lot of future value, especially if the crime rate does end up getting out of hand."

perth,3916y2,littleblackcat,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:32:12 2015 UTC,"Seems like a decent area for families with a huge variety of schools, but as already mentioned elsewhere it's the middle of nowhere, a good 20mins from either NoR suburbs or Eastern suburbs, let alone the city. Swan Valley is close but id imagine you'd get tired of using that area to go out in if you wanted a meal or entertainment, etc.  Connecting roads and public transport is abysmal considering the size of the area now, roads issue will be resolved in about 5 years when Tonkin Hwy is extended through as part of the Northlink project. The area probably won't get dedicated public transport/rail for another 15-20 years due to limited viability as a result of the sheer isolation of the area from the city and other suburbs.  As already mentioned future property value is probably higher risk there then any other area of Perth due to its continuous growth and isolation from the rest of the city. Do not expect a property you purchase their now to appreciate in value at all. A friend purchased a property there in 2012, moved to Melbourne last year and was unable to sell it for the purchase price, or even $20-30k under, and is renting it as a result now.  To me, the whole area is just an unusually isolated piece of suburbia, but I know plenty of people that seem to like it, so who am I to judge. :)"

Anyway, I was walking my dogs around 9:30 pm on Friday night, when both my husband and I saw a bright green streak across the sky, with purple at the end. No explosion, so it wasn't a firework (or noise for that matter). It was so bright and just bizarre. I've never seen anything like it. This was in helena valley. Possible explanations?"

If it's to bring people from the other stations and car parks to the ground, it should start from further up river on the city side shouldn't it?  I'm not sure, haven't checked.

Perth planners have a history of making functionality a hind sight, eg the freeway extensions needing to be widened rather than doing properly the first time.  Is the bridge wide enough to handle crowds moving in both directions? If a group of people decide to stop and have a good old chat in the middle of the bridge will it disrupt the flow? If the stadium capacity is increased at a later date, will the bridge handle the extra people.

The bridge is needed for the stadium, to open up access and parking for it. does it need to look ""iconic""? maybe not, but the cost associated with making it iconic is probably small compared to the total and I would much prefer something iconic that adds vibrancy to the city than have another dull grey square object."

Putting a bit of effort into making each piece of infrastructure special is what'll help do it, and that's what they've done here. Even if you hate the design, anything that isn't a plain utilitarian minimum-cost build is, by definition, actively working against dullness.  There's not much around it now because, well, things are still under construction, but the plans for the stadium area are for other uses too.

perth,38wqh0,nahcoob,2,Sun Jun 7 15:44:54 2015 UTC,"Unlikely, but at the very least they would have a sign in the window or at the counter advertising the position. If they did, I'd suggest what you would be planning to do if you're confident you can give off an awesome first impression to the manager (if you can get a hold of them).   You might have better luck with smaller businesses doing what you describe rather then major national chains."

perth,38wqh0,_cephei,3,Mon Jun 8 03:56:51 2015 UTC,I did casual work at EB that I got applying through seek but at the group interview quite a few people were there from handing in resumes to the store. The store manager where I was at was always happy to take in resumes and if you were a regular at the store then you had a better chance of getting an interview when it came time to them needing to hire
perth,38wqh0,_cephei,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:19:33 2015 UTC,What time of year was this? I've only seen them advertise during the christmas period.
perth,38wqh0,_cephei,2,Sun Jun 7 15:24:23 2015 UTC,"It was Christmas, I worked from October till January. Most of the time Christmas casuals actually do stay on (a lot of the managers there actually started as Christmas casuals) but a staff promotion at the store fell through so they weren't losing a team member like expected. I was fine with this, I got pregnant soon after starting and it was pretty rough on me"
perth,38wqh0,_cephei,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:34:34 2015 UTC,"Alright, because I was hoping to make the jump into retail now, I've got 2 months off from uni, and even next semester have a light schedule. Want to get out of the late night working at McDonalds, I'm sure my constant availability would be an upside, right?  Also, if you don't mind me asking, what was the pay rate like there?"
perth,38wqh0,_cephei,2,Sun Jun 7 15:42:03 2015 UTC,"I was on $23/hr there but I am also 25 so it might be more than you would be on. Shifts were really short though, each store only gets a tiny budget so I only worked 4-6 hours a week and that was with pretty good availability. I never once paid tax which shows how little I made so honestly if you're wanting money I would look elsewhere.  Do you want a career in retail? What are you studying? If you have completely open availability you could probably find something better"
perth,38wqh0,whereismydragon,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:49:03 2015 UTC,"I'd like to get out of fast food, or at least I don't want to spend my next 3 years there while I finish my degree in Business Information Systems.  The EB store I frequent, it always seems to be the same guy working, whether that's just a coincidence or he works all the time, I'm not sure. But I would like somewhere, where I could maybe work 3-5 days a week, preferably in electronics or something like that as that's sort of my interests."
perth,38wqh0,renstimpy,2,Sun Jun 7 15:52:48 2015 UTC,"Manager works most of the time, especially if by themselves. You won't get that many shifts without at least being a permanent staff member. Maybe look at places like Dick Smith or Harvey Norman, even Officeworks, officeworks are open late so you should pick up some shifts at least.   Another option is contact centre work, iiNet no longer take on casuals but I believe Telstra do (you could also apply for their retail stores too, and other stores like Mo's which I believe are franchise so would be good places to drop your resume into store). It can be soul draining though so keep that in mind, but I found retail worst tbh.    A lot of smaller chain type retail places generally rely on people just sending their resume through and word of mouth for employment, they don't have HR or anyone to put up job ads. When I was looking for casual retail work I didn't bother with seek much, I just emailed my resume to as many places as I could find. If you're good with computers then you can check out PLE, MSY etc.   I recommend doing a cover letter for every place too if you're going to be emailing your resume, don't just send an email saying ""I am interested in a position, please find attached my resume"". Say why you're a good fit and make sure you're resume is to the point. If you're handing in a resume in store make sure your resume covers your availability even if at the moment you're completely available but mention it may change once semester or whatever returns. Don't put hobbies on your resume, no one actually cares. (Sorry if this is all a given, in an old job I was responsible for reading resumes and narrowing down 100's to just a handful to interview and the crap people put was crazy. If you're resume was >4 pages long for a basic helpdesk job then I wouldn't finish reading it)."

I've been over at /r/resumes for a while, so I think my resume is up to scratch and fits within the limitations and expectations of employers.  I checked out PLE, might of just been my internet connection at the time but nothing loaded for the careers page. So I'll try them out again, love their stuff, buy all my computer gear from them. Will definitely go and look for other similar stores like them."
perth,38wqh0,Therzthz,2,Sun Jun 7 16:17:28 2015 UTC,"No problem, I spent a long time searching for casual retail work to get me through studying and it was pretty difficult. EB was the only interview I actually got. If I hadn't have gotten that job I would have started applying at places like Woolworths, Big W, Target etc. It was a big shock after working full time for 6+ years. Just be prepared to send a LOT of resumes and hopefully you'll find something =] good luck!"
perth,38wqh0,Brewjo,2,Sun Jun 7 16:26:08 2015 UTC,I only ever hand in a resume if they have a sign in the window advertising for staff. Either that or apply online via Seek or the store's own website.

perth,38wm5p,gospursgo_,8,Sun Jun 7 13:26:14 2015 UTC,"Ok, so this area is actually my job. Personally the best I can do for any customer is the cost rate we are given daily (based around an internal cost spread for the business, not the spot rate) + 2%... this weekend that was about 0.79 (or 1.265 the other way around). You generally won't get better then that on a margin basis from a money changer or bank for cash unless you've got tens of thousands of dollars, or if you find someone willing to buy your cash from you privately (not sure how good Gumtree could be for something like this but I can imagine you'd have to be SUPER SUPER careful). If you're interested just send me a message.  In General:  Commission is becoming a thing of the past in the industry as in the past couple of years it has become signifcantly more competitive with a variety of businesses expanding - all the banks charge flat fees (no more then $10), and most of the major foreign exchange brands don't charge commission at all (or will waive it if you ask nicely), but will have a slightly larger spread (especially for BUY rates, as the market tends to be less competitive then selling currency, especially the majors). Of the banks, Westpac generally offer the best buy rate for USD, and CBA or NAB the worst, however expect to be refused service from most banks (with exception to the CBD) unless you are depositing the money directly into a bank account. Several bank branches in WA got burnt to the tune of high 5 figure sums from accepting counterfeit high denomination Euro notes last year, so many of them have temporarily ceased exchanging foreign currency for cash."

Personally, I found UAE Exchange to usually give a better rate.  You can't beat the online foreign exchange such as OzForex. It requires you to have a bank account here and one in the country you're sending to (doesn't have to be yours). It takes a couple of weeks but it's a better rate. It also gives you info regarding currency trends, etc. So you can make informed decisions on when to change."

Open Citibank transaction plus account  Deposit USD into account at the Perth branch at St Georges Terrace.  Transfer AUD out of the account into your regular bank account's.  The citibank trans plus account does not charge a commission on currency conversion so when you use the account to fund a purchase in foreign currency you only pay the visa conversion rate. You would have to check the terms and conditions of the account but it may be a fee free conversion?!

On a personal level none of my gay friends discriminate and on a sexual level I think they find that bisexuals are more of a challenge as there is more competition.
perth,38poad,nahcoob,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:28:36 2015 UTC,"No kidding the sexpo is on!!! Thanks for that! :D and thanks for your reply, glad to hear you and your wife seem to have an awesome, honest relationship :)"
perth,38poad,The_Valar,4,Sat Jun 6 10:54:17 2015 UTC,"Not sure what is going on in the city, but me and the mrs have been exploring our local area. When the weather is nice we like to drive down to Point Peron, Port Kennedy beach or Warnbro Beach for a bit of a fun. There is usually something going on. So far Point Peron is our favourite and we never have any issues finding someone to play with."
perth,38poad,lukesanoob,2,Sat Jun 6 02:22:38 2015 UTC,"Bisexual man here. Never really had any issue with biphobia, and while I don't go out much, The Court is a nice LGBTQ club."
perth,38poad,OsterGuard,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:32:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply :) good to know you've never had a biphobia experience.   Do you know what nights are best for the Court? I tried to talk some of my girlfriends into going the other night but they weren't very keen as they are all straight. I didn't mention that I secretly wanted to check it out to see if I really am attracted to girls or if it's just a fantasy.... I'm kinda new to this!
perth,38poad,I_FAP_TO_ANIME_BOYS,3,Fri Jun 5 20:52:15 2015 UTC,"Surprised they aren't keen, most nights (especially Fri/Sat) there is probably more straight people then gay in there... Mainly for the reason /u/OsterGuard has said."
perth,38poad,OsterGuard,2,Sat Jun 6 00:25:10 2015 UTC,"One of my friends has a lesbian sister, and she seems to think that they don't really like straight people hanging out at their hotspots for that reason... They're straight. But it's interesting hearing other people's opinions as well! I couldn't see it really being a problem either :)"

perth,38poad,eskilla,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:53:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot, The Court seems to be the more popular one from the replies I've gotten. I have been there before a couple years back when  I was 18 and 100% straight and I loved it!   I'm 24 now and I'm starting to think I might love it for other reasons instead :P"
perth,38poad,elrangarino,4,Sat Jun 6 10:50:31 2015 UTC,"Not really sure to be honest. I know that some of their drinks are only available from friday to sunday (I think), so friday night would probably be your best option. To be honest, The Court is fine for straight people too. It's just a really nice club, with less obnoxious assholes most of the time.  In my experience, most people who start to think they might be bisexual usually are. Welcome to the community! :) If you've got any questions, I could help, or /r/lgbt and /r/ainbow are pretty good options."
perth,38poad,wil987,2,Fri Jun 5 20:56:42 2015 UTC,"ola' i work at the court. since febuary we have made all of our cocktails available seven days a week and have just brought out our new winter menu. Tommorow night we are re-launching Wednesday night entertainment with Drag Factory's new hosts and our 6$ drink and pizza specials until 10pm. i dont get paid for this, i love my work, and hope to see you all down soon :)"

perth,38poad,mr30h7,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:05:00 2015 UTC,No problem! Don't ever feel like you have to prove your sexuality to anyone. You can identify as bisexual without ever doing anything with a woman.

I try not to be callous, and genuinely feel awful at wasted human life, which I've seen directly, but I'm not feeling a hell of a lot of sympathy for this bastard.  He fucked over a lot of people who didn't deserve. Quite a few who did, mind you, but he didn't discriminate.   I think if you live your life as a piece of shit, it eats away at your physical health.

In the 1980s, the state government, which was led for much of the period by premier Brian Burke, engaged in business dealings with several prominent businessmen, including Alan Bond, Laurie Connell, Dallas Dempster, John Roberts, and Warren Anderson. These dealings resulted in a loss of public money, estimated at a minimum of $600 million and the insolvency of several large corporations.  Bond and Connell were major contributors to the party in government, the Australian Labor Party and its remarkable fundraising structure, the John Curtin Foundation.  A royal commission (the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters) was established in 1990 by Labor premier Carmen Lawrence to examine the dealings.

perth,38jaxg,maxitaxied,7,Fri Jun 5 08:24:09 2015 UTC,"Tested asbestos exposure samples for a decade.  Small amounts can harm. The mainstream line that 'one fibre can kill' is true.  However, for an asbestos fibre to make the journey past your tongue or through your nostrils, down your throat, past the primary, secondary and tertiary bronchi and lodge in a somewhat perpendicular orientation to your lung membrane, the chances of one fibre killing are difficult to calculate especially if you factor in the chaotic nature of micrometre sized particles in gas as well. But on repeated exposure, if you let a couple of million/billion fibres try to run that gauntlet, chances of illness certainly increase. Asbestos is unfair because someone get sick from the one time they bounced a tennis ball off a fence. Someone else could host a sandcastle competition in Wittenoom and come away just fine. The biggest ally in your corner is not munching durries. Smoking kills the macrophages in your lungs. These dudes sweep up all the shit in your lungs and make you cough it up.  From here, definitely get a copy of the lab report. You can also request that scanning electron microscopy be conducted on the filter paper. That will determine if the fibres observed by the lab tech were indeed asbestos (under the microscope, many harmless fibres look like asbestos, but lab techs have to count them in accordance with the method under phase contrast microscopy).  Finally, wear your P2 mask, shave everyday to ensure a good fit and throw away the disposables after one use because the seal will never  be reformed."

One marriage, whether between same sex or opposite sex couples, can't remove a commitment another marriage has. If it could, people would be against no fault divorce, and 5 minute marriages between celebrities. A marriage should be between those legally contracted (regardless of gender) and that is all. What one married couple does (like open marriages) has no bearing on another.

To allow homosexuals to get married would require the definition of 'marriage' to be changed.  It's not that homosexuals can't get married because they're gay. It's because they are physically can't have the same sort of relationship.  Saying a man should have the right to have children is different from saying men should be able to bear children. They just can't - they don't have a uterus for the foetus to gestate in.  Likewise, a gay couple simply cannot have a relationship that is the same as a straight couple - it's not that they aren't allowed, it's simply impossible.  To pretend that homosexuals have interchangeable roles as a straight couple is disingenuous.  Think of it this way. Lets say I love my dog, and my dog loves me. We live together, and we rely on a single income. We want to raise a litter together, although they will have to be the dogs, because obviously we can't have natural puppies of our own. Should we be able to get married? Maybe.  What do you think people would say if I suggested it? Probably no.  If I were married, and someone I knew suggested they had the same relationship with their dog, I would say, 'no - you don't.' And to say otherwise detracts from what it means to be married to a person.  Likewise, gays can be in a serious emotional and physical relationship - but it isn't what married people currently have.  So by all means, let gay people have something. Call it whatever (maybe Sacred Union). But don't pretend it is interchangeable with what heterosexual married people have, because it obviously isn't, or else we wouldn't label people straight and gay."

That being said, your implied equivalency between gay relationships and bestiality is offensive and the slippery slope argument is a logical fallacy.   gays can be in a serious emotional and physical relationship - but it isn't what married people currently have    Ultimately the problem is that your fundamental premise is wrong; you keep saying that gay relationships are not only different, but have less value than straight ones. This is wrong. Gay men and women can and do hold relationships just as deep and meaningful as straight people. Examples of loving, deeply committed gay couples are in abundance and these families really are the cultural equivalent of marriage.  I think you need to learn a little bit more. Once you have had an opportunity to meet some gay couples you will recognise, just like wider society, that denying gay people the right to marriage has no rational basis, is discriminatory, and needs to be excised from our laws."

I'm not actually making the slippery slope argument.  I was trying to think of a similar emotional relationship which emphasised that the emotional bond is not enough to define a marriage.  No offence intended - sorry if it was taken.  Please feel free to find your own analogy.   you keep saying that gay relationships are not only different, but have less value than straight ones.   I have never said they have less value.  My argument is only that they are essentially different.   This is wrong. Gay men and women can and do hold relationships just as deep and meaningful as straight people. Examples of loving, deeply committed gay couples are in abundance and these families really are the cultural equivalent of marriage.   I'm not contesting that.

Once you have had an opportunity to meet some gay couples you will recognise, just like wider society, that denying gay people the right to marriage has no rational basis, is discriminatory, and needs to be excised from our laws.   I have many gay friends.  You're simply being condescending now.  The right to be married is not my point.  My point it that doesn't make sense to have the right if they simply cannot.  If a gay individual wants to have a relationship that is indistinguishable from a heterosexual relationship they cannot do that with someone of the same gender.  Consider this - the LGBTIQQA community has fought for legal recognition of their sexuality.  Now they are fighting that their relationship be made indistinguishable, from a legal point of view, from a heterosexual relationship.

This is based on both gender and sexuality.  Marriage, as it stands, is a complex social arrangement.  Homosexuals may want the right to be married in the way a heterosexual couple is, but they cannot.  They cannot by definition.  This is simply the way it is.

There is more to being a man and woman than what is between your legs.  The comparison is valid, because, just as a man-dog relationship is different from a man-man or woman-woman relationship, so are they different to a man-woman relationship.  You're trying to reduce the debate to being about rights, but you're trivialising the matter.  There is more to this than that. There are millions of married people in Australia, and you want them to be told that what they committed to isn't what they committed to anymore.

Spoiler alert; this is mainly why US states have been falling like ninepins into allowing same sex marriage - it was never defined so exclusively and it's debatable government should even be involved in the first place (that and more clearly defined rights over there than we have).  So the argument to keep it as is loses, repeatedly.  Secondly, bringing up your dog is a furphy (ar ar).  Animals can't consent to a marriage contract like people can.  You later bring up the idea that ""this would change marriage for other people"".  I can sort of see why people think this but, given somewhat longer thought they'd see it's actually nonsense.  Nothing about their relationship is going to change, legally/contractually/whathaveyou, because other people get to have it now as well.  Beyond that it's tantamount to saying people would think ""Well I'm not going to join this individual contract between two people so long as those people can join the same contract between to people!"".  That's really an untenable position in this day and age, whether people feel it or not.  The immediate implications are problematic:  That marriage is some sacred institution, maybe.  Well a church can prohibit same sex marriage.  But that doesn't mean the government can with quite the same ease.  Or that it's all about the special things between a man and woman.  Which are...what? Natural born children? Even the possibility of natural born children? There's no test for that or requirement for that in marriage ever.  It might have been implied for the longest time, but nobody ever demanded it and no one has any hope of reasonably enforcing it.  Any way you follow this logic it runs aground pretty fast."

Went there a month or so back and the food came to us cold and late. Turns out the chef's were changing over at that time and our meal accidentally got left a little longer. We let them know how we felt and they comped the meal for us."
perth,38i9iv,nahcoob,-1,Fri Jun 5 03:13:38 2015 UTC,"I can tell the difference between a good place having a bad day, and a dish which is never intended to be anything better than a massive slab of meat with sauce on it. The ribs had no seasoning at all on the prior to cooking, no dry rub, no special way of cooking (smoking etc). They just said they were tender. You can make ribs tender by boiling them in water for four hours. Their only attempt at flavouring them was coating them with bbq sauce.  I can promise you that if I went back there this weekend, they'd be no different."
perth,38i9iv,obzelite2point0,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:27:22 2015 UTC,Dare I ask which location you went to? The quality of food and service does vary.  Personally:  Midland has shitty service  Northbridge has obviously smaller serving sizes  Joondalup can be a bit slow but quality is great  Never had any glaring problems at other locations including interstate.
perth,38i9iv,Sinthesys,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:29:26 2015 UTC,Northbridge. Portion size wasn't the issue.
perth,38i9iv,FutureSynth,2,Mon Jun 8 09:57:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's common knowledge the only reason the steak there is tender is because it's slow cooked (allowing them to use lower quality cuts). That and the faux American style service is really off putting.  Perth people really love their chain restaurants though, so it doesn't surprise me that people like it."

perth,38hvze,Redbeardbanjo,12,Thu Jun 4 09:17:45 2015 UTC,"I feel like every city says their public transport isn't the best but I think it does its job considering the sprawling layout of perth and there are free buses throughout the city. Beer IS expensive. Shops are staying open later. Nowhere is really that dangerous but walking around Northbridge, Midland or Armadale in the early AM on a weekend by yourself can be. I don't think Americans can pull off saying cunt like we do. Bogan: more of a joke but depends on who you say it to and how you say it like anything else. You need a license to busk in the city."
perth,38hvze,garagebrigade,7,Thu Jun 4 09:33:01 2015 UTC,"Compared to big cities in CA we have excellent public transport IMO, where cities of a similar population to Perth might get a bus service if they're lucky. As long as you aren't in outer suburbs in areas of Perth not serviced by a rail line (North-East corridor is the main problem here, or the hills, or far outer suburbs), it's pretty decent.  The other points op raised...  Despite popular belief on reddit, people don't throw cunt around here as common slang, they just use it as often as other swear words are used, unlike the US. You'll probably hear less mofo and more cunt, in general.  Bogan... a bit of both. Best way to light-heartedly describe it, everyone has a bit of bogan in them. some just more then others. If people are offended about it then it's their problem, not yours.  No specific no-go zones IMO but if you do find yourselves near undesirable people keep to yourself and ignore them if they try and provoke a response out of you. Same goes for people on public transport that are drunk/on drugs.  Beer prices are easily twice, maybe three times what you get in CA both in a bar (though you don't tip the bartender here) or to buy at a liquor store, same for spirits and hard liquor. Wine is cheaper, though - thus the drink of choice to get wasted here is box wine (goon).  Shops are open earlier (most stores open at 8 or 9am), but close earlier accordingly (5 to 6pm, later in the evening one night a week only) then in the US. The major Supermarkets and Discount stores (e.g - Kmart, Target) generally open til 9pm on weekdays though. Weekend shopping hours, especially Sundays are still quite heavily restricted. Despite that, it's not hard to find a 24 hour supermarket these days. This is an area where laws are very slowly becoming more liberalised.   Busking requires a license from the local government in which you choose to busk in.  Have an awesome time here :)"

They also seem to have solved the problem of busses bursting into flames.  You do meet the odd wierdo on the train. During peak times it can be hard to get a seat, But standing isnt really that bad. And if you happen to find yourself in strife, there are plenty of helping hands.  Beer doesnt have to be expensive, a carton of red chook is usually good value for money. Depending on the number of people drinking you may want to pick up two.  Not all shops close early, if your willing to go for a bit of a drive there is a 24 hour department store just down the road.  Keep an eye out for anyone organising a ""meet up"", these are a great way to introduce yourself to some of the regulars and meet some other cunts."

A psychologist is going to be better at teaching you techniques to deal with the depression and anxiety, e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness. A psychiatrist is good for prescribing medication. A counsellor / therapist who is not a psychologist or psychiatrist does not have the same type of training, accreditation or registration process, so their styles and effectiveness are more varied.  Are you currently on medication? Is it working? If so, keep that up and reviewed with your GP and see a psychologist. If you don't want any medication, again, go with a psychologist. If your depression and/or anxiety are particularly bad and worsening, see a psychiatrist. You can also see both if you like, because they work on different things, but that can be expensive.  I recommend you start with a psychologist and go from there. You may find this website helpful: https://www.psychology.org.au/FindaPsychologist/"

You should be able to get an idea from there if they're going to bring in religion.   The rest is all very personal. What one person likes in a psych, the next may dislike. Some people like blunt and straightforward, and some like soft and encouraging. It may be a process of trial and error to find the right person, but just keep going and you'll find them. It's easier once you know what you're looking for, too, because you can call up and ask about that beforehand.

Fremantle, Leederville, North Perth/Mount Lawley, Vic Park all have thriving cafe scenes and a decent (ish) nightlife. Most other places....don't.  The Hills are GORGEOUS, but expensive and prone to bushfires.  The commutes are horrible. Try to find a place to live as close to your work as possible.  Stay away from Balga, Girrawheen, Koondoola, Armadale and Midland. Guildford is lovely but right under the flight paths for the airport.  The summers are HOT. You need airconditioning and SPF50+. Do not go out in the sun between 10 am and 3pm if you can avoid it. Similarly, get an airconditioned car.  You've probably already got this from the sidebar, but Rotto and Margaret River /Dunsborough / Yallingup are lovely to visit.  Most spiders you come across aren't that poisonous, but the snakes are. Also the big ants (Bull Ants and Sargent-Major ants) are horrible and will bite you hard. Watch where you're standing on bush trails as they often make huge nests along the pathways....  Esperance is well worth a visit if you can hack the drive.  Perthites are, on the whole, lovely people - but they cannot drive for shit and behave like methheads on the road. Indicators are optional and tailgating is compulsory. Be careful. Also there are fixed speed cameras on the freeways.  My favourite beach is Waterman's Point and my second favourite beach is Trigg Island :) Lovely for snorkelling !! Well worth taking up a water sport - there is excellent diving as well as boating and a big yachting scene. Also kite surfing, wind surfing, body surfing and surfing surfing.  The beer is expensive. Everything is expensive. Bring money :)"

Most areas have ADSL2+ available which can range from 3Mbps to 24 Mbps depending on a whole range of factors,  but some areas may not have ports at the exchange (this affects older areas as well where the has been lots of subdivision development),  others have ADSL1 (upto 8 Mbps),  there is some HFC in newer areas that ranges from 8-100 Mbps depending on provider,  East Victoria Park,  South Perth,  and larger estates built in the last 3 years have FTTP. The current federal government is trying to get a gimped upgrade to VDSL2 started,  which should cover the entire metro area,  but is still in the planning stages after nearly 2 years and will only guarantee 12 Mbps for the first 18 months.

Renting first is important, but be aware that rentals only come with stoves/ovens, rarely come with dishwashers, and almost never with washers, dryers, or fridges.   Dryers are only useful for about 2 months of the year, the rest of the year people use clothes lines - save power - our power stations are still Coal or Gas, but there's a lot of infeed Solar, some wind and some hydro, but not as much as Ontario.  Driving - Speed limits are firm and fixed - do not exceed them. Drivers won't alternate-merge, they will speed up to be first. You'll see why so many people will use the word ""cunt"" readily.

perth,38di32,auDingo,6,Wed Jun 3 19:16:42 2015 UTC,"Australia operates the ""two tier"" system that so many Canadians are frightened of. There is the federally mandated and taxed and local government delivered medicare coverage system, and there are private insurances too.   Health care services covered by medicare are refunded at the medicare rate by the federal government - even if delivered through a private provider. So it might cost $300 to see a specialist, and the government benefit is $75 - so you pay $300, then get the $75 back from the government. Same thing with general practitioners (family doctors) - usually $65-75 for a visit, with a ~$20 benefit. Anything you pay above the government coverage is considered a ""gap"" payment - after paying a certain amount per year (~$1500per person I think), the government will even cover the gap.   Services in public hospitals are ""bulk billed"", meaning the core service is paid directly by the government insurance. Some doctors do this, but very very very few. Add on services in public hospitals are paid by you and re-imbursed per your private policy - things like private rooms, TVs, phone, etc. In a private hospital, same deal, your public basic insurance covers some of it, but your private would pick up the rest.   Ambulance services are provided by St Johns Ambulance Service, which is not covered by medicare, but is covered by most private health insurance. As a 40 year old, you should sign up for private health insurance as soon as possible. Uninsured ambulance rides are about $580 I believe.  All figures several years out of date, and government policy is decided on the whim of a madman and then retracted after public outcry, so its hard to keep track of what changes have actually made it through..."

But mostly, it was where to find cheap groceries, what's open late, what nights are good to go out, festivals, what are the cool touristy things to help you love the city, what's a good hang out spot, what food is unique, and just generally how to make friends with locals.   Which doesn't help much, I guess. But most things can be figured out with experimentation. The number one piece of advice I can give; never lock yourself in to anything too soon. Don't throw down a 1 year lease the day you arrive, choose a certain bank, credit card, phone plan, buy a 'good deal' of a car, that kind of stuff.  Sports are the best way to make friends in Perth.

Life is so good here we have to find something to argue about. That, and the construction of cities and towns in Perth and Western Australia is very different to Canada, very different.   This brings me to my next point. Sort out a car and ensure driving licenses are current pretty much as soon as you land. Without these, having a good time/life in Perth is difficult. We also have good riding weather so invest in a bike. I like motorbikes, they go fast.  My ex-boss (ex as of 3 days ago) is Canadian, good bloke, I'll apply the same logic to you eh?

Bibbulmun leaving from Kalamunda is probably the best for hills, it has great scenery, well marked tracks and huts for sleeping in.   a less known about track is the coastal plains trail leaving from Yanchep. its pretty easy/flat, but you could try and compensate by walking longer distances every day.  http://www.bushlandperth.org.au/images/stories/Groups/ridges/wild_about_walking_yanchep_np.pdf  most of the best and most difficult treks are in Tasmania"

In my opinion you already know what is the best training for ""the track"" ... stairs. 90% of the time you'll either be walking uphill or along a kinda flat area.  As its not so much long distances each day but steep climbs, you'll take small steps up the sides of ridges/mountains instead of long strides.  My training mostly consisted of walking across the Mundaring weir (with a heavy daypack) a few times most evenings from the top carpark to the bottom carpark. The view is lovely and it has a bit of variety - stairs, a steep walk way and think there is still dirt track there...   Saying that.. you've asked about hiking trails!  Others have suggested a great one - eagle view in John Forest National park. You also have some good stretches of hills on the bibulman track when walking from the brookton highway back towards Mundaring (a couple of days trip).  Best of luck, I hope you enjoy yourself!  May I suggest taking some gastrolyte (immodium being obligatory).etc on the track as our group had a bout of ... ""kokoda fever"" (what we called it). A couple of our guys had to be flown out half way after a day of the runs inducing dehydration.

Kwinana beach is about a 15 minute drive from Kwinana, and it's dominated by industry. It's not a great beach. You're better off driving a few more minutes to the Rockingham foreshore, Palm Beach, Point Peron, Shoalwater, Warnboro, etc.  Kwinana itself is OK if you're from around there, but it's a bit rough.

It makes me wonder if they stake places out or it's just bad luck of leaving your door unlocked at that moment. It's disgusting how blatantly the pricks will just walk in and take your shit.  I've had guys going through my flatmate's room and our lounge room while I was sitting outside, and just assumed they were the flatmate's friends."

Adrenaline takes over and I run out of my bed naked screaming right out to the roadside, kid shits himself and the others with him bail (they had their stolen car ready to go unfortunately). They'd broken in by smashing the glass on the front doors and forcing entry, completely destroying the doors as a result and making an enormous mess.  Good Part: by waking up when I did they didnt steal my car, wallet, phone. Only thing of mine stolen was my 3DS (which was in another room). Insurance got everything replaced in less then a month.  Bad Part: a lot of stuff that wasn't mine up the front of the house was stolen, 10k worth. Thankfully no one else was home at the time of it occurring so no other cars could be stolen.  In terms of location, pretty generic northern suburb, albeit on main road frontage."

perth,382ami,sweetpineapple,6,Mon Jun 1 14:34:20 2015 UTC,"I have a cheap one and while it works, the IR bulbs started to fail recently.   I also got a set from JB-Hifi, called Arlo. Fairly new to the market and it's fantastic to use! It's daunting at first, but once you understand the 'rules' and 'modes' for the camera behaviours, it's a versatile to use with the customisable modes and adjustable sensitivity.  It runs on batteries. Initially, I thought this would be a problem, but the pros of being about to mount it anywhere in and around the house (it's weatherproof too) and after 3 months, the battery indicator still hasn't lost a single bar.   It provides free cloud services that stores videos up to 7days (You can download the videos if you want).  It's not as cheap as Dx.com but imo, it's worth it with all the features that comes with it."

Just one question: what is your home internet connection like? Ours is pretty shoddy, upload speed in particular. Is it possible for the cam to store footage locally?   Kind of excited. Would love to catch these fuckers and the more information I can pass on to the cops, the better."
perth,382ami,Boredtodeathbutlovef,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:55:38 2015 UTC,"I had my cameras set up to record for 30seconds after motion has been detected and it takes just about the same time to complete an upload to cloud. I do have NBN at my place however.  That said, it takes a couple of seconds to notify your smartphone after motion has been detected.   No, it cannot store locally. Put it this way, if you had a DVR for your security cameras, it might be stolen in the robbery as well. So cloud would be safer imo.  Also, you can always add more cameras to the system later on when you can afford more of it and it's as easy and pressing the sync buttons on them."
perth,382ami,itchyballz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:14:31 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough about local storage, it'd just be nice to have the option.

What's the website talking about with upgrading a ""service plan""? Is that for the Cloud?  Cheers for hearing me out too. It's always so much better to just get the information from an impartial user rather than someone who's trying to sell the product."
perth,382ami,gattaaca,3,Thu Jun 4 08:45:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the upgrade plan lets you store videos for more than a week and allows more than 5 arlo cameras to a base station.  Basic free plan is more than enough for the majority I think.   The back of the camera is magnetic, and I have one placed on the metal frame of the door to my computer room. Pretty nifty.   No problems man, having been burglared myself. I know how much it can fuck up our lives even with insurance. The more we can help prevent robberies or catch the culprits, the better for the rest of us."

All of us were home one night having a few drinks up stairs when someone came in and took 3 phones, sets of keys and a brand new car from the driveway. The house mate who left the front door unlocked was not popular...   The car was trashed and dumped at the local shops about a week later. Bourbon spilt everywhere, cigarette burns in the seats etc. Cops never caught them but the car was returned.   Apparently they did a fuel drive off too, but the CCTV wasn't good enough to see their faces.   We weren't in a particularly shitty suburb either. It's a suburb known for this kind of stuff due to it being close to the city, but it certainly was no Armadale or Balga."

If you can't afford to open on a public holiday, don't open. Simple as that. Businesses can't even use excuses like other states do around this argument as it's illegal for shopping centres to penalise stores for not opening on specific days or hours in WA."
perth,380pv9,nahcoob,2,Mon Jun 1 01:20:37 2015 UTC,"The issue is, public holidays are during a standard week; meaning one less day open in what would otherwise be a standard income week, affecting overheads etc. There's valid arguments on both sides..."
perth,380pv9,tatty000,7,Mon Jun 1 05:14:14 2015 UTC,"I've always found the day after a public holiday (or before and after it if it's not a Monday) is significantly busier - obviously this wouldn't be the same in a hospitality setting but in a retail setting my anecdotal experience has been as such.  In hospo public holidays should be busy enough that unless you run a cafe or restaurant in an area that relies on weekday business (in which you would normally close over the weekend anyway), you would make your money back even with the penalty rates (let alone the 10-15% surcharge most places charge on a Public Holiday now within Hospitality)."
perth,380pv9,nahcoob,3,Mon Jun 1 05:32:04 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Basically the only hospitality businesses that are effected negatively due to public holidays are fast food joints; people usually eat there because they are on a lunch break and need something quick or want something on the way home. These businesses usually pay no extra for nights or Saturday and only 50% extra on Sunday so whilst their sales might be down a little on public holidays the increase in wages isn't that significant.   However; actual restaurants and cafe's where it takes a considerable amount of time are massively boosted by public holidays because people don't mind waiting around for their food and want to catch up with friends or family. These are the businesses that sometimes are on awards which pay rather high penalty rates BUT the increased trade that they get should more than make up for it. Just take a walk down the cafe strip in your area on a public holiday and most places should be overflowing.   Also, like you say especially in WA due to the 11-5 trading restrictions or days where the shopping center can't open at all; people always unload their wallets the day before - so whilst Anzac day Saturday might be a bit quiet the day before (Friday) is one of the busiest days of the year so it balanced it out a bit."
perth,380pv9,Duideka,4,Mon Jun 1 08:04:50 2015 UTC,"Demand and supply. When people are away on holidays, lower wages aren’t going to bring them back unless they can’t afford to go on holiday."

perth,380pv9,Duideka,3,Mon Jun 1 03:52:06 2015 UTC,"That's nothing compared to Coles / Woolies too.   The average Coles does $115,604 per day ($809,230 a week) - but it's higher in WA.  The Coles in the shopping center I work in is one of the top ones in WA and does $1,600,000 on a usual week, around $240k per day (!!) - on public holidays they frequently hit $300k  Around Christmas time it isn't out of the question to do over half a million dollars per day. These business are making insane amounts of money."

If you don't want to spend time working on the weekend, at night or on public holidays because you want to spend time with your family, newsflash: SO DO YOUR STAFF!  Trying to say cutting penalty rates will create jobs is just bullshit; it's almost always people who operate hospitality businesses that whinge about them and in all cases there will be the bare minimum staff working at any time regardless of if they are paid $1 a hour or $100 a hour. Why hire 2 people if one will get the job done? Any savings will just end up in the store owners pockets.  Colin can claim that hospitality businesses are doing it tough paying triple wages... Yeah, nar - have you ever worked in a restaurant Colin? If you know of one that pays triple wages please let me know because I'll send my resume to them tomorrow and I'm sure there is a million other people working in hospitality that would love to get on board too. Typically you get 50% extra on a public holiday or Sunday and 25% extra on Saturday if anything at all."

The equivelent would be inner west, but unless you had friends there, you wouldn't go there  The thing is, if you get an opal card. You can unlimited transport for $15/day (plus airport gate fee). If you're in sydney for 2 days, you can easily get around with public transport, particularly the train system. Imo most of the time, i can get to a place quicker via public transport than by car."

This will really determine if you need a car mid you are in the cbd or East then no, if you are west or South then maybe.   I assume that the game is at Homebush? If it is your first time you don't want to drive to Homebush, the traffic is nasty when there is a major event and you need to prebook parking which is limited and expensive.   For major events they run special train services straight to Homebush and typically they are free. This is the best option to get to the game."

perth,37wsy9,be-happier,5,Sun May 31 09:01:39 2015 UTC,"Forensics is generally a token effort, and often they won't even bother half the time depending on the wording of your police report.

perth,37wsy9,599GTO,2,Mon Jun 1 01:45:50 2015 UTC,"Well you'll find that if there is any CCTV that will be circulated agency wide and these days on social media, in attempts to identify those responsible.  Forensics attend to assess whether there is any forensic value to the scene, not everything will hold a fingerprint. But yeah sadly people aren't stupid, not completely, they'll wear gloves.  But you still need to attend. Idiots cut themselves in windows they've broken, leave hair in drawers they've reached back down into, etc.   They are taken seriously, often perpetrated by serial offenders that can be easily recognised, but their gait, favourite hat, distinctive tattoo, etc. Then again, people these days are employing face coverings for something as simple as a burglary.   Clearance rates for burglaries though aren't high. That info is readily available in the police annual report, but you still need to try."

perth,37x39t,yourspleenisshowing,6,Sun May 31 04:30:14 2015 UTC,"At Yanchep there are a couple of what I would call half-day walks, the one that goes all the way around the north side of the lake is great. I believe it's the Ghost House walk, or perhaps it's another that incorporates ghost house. Go there early to avoid the screaming fucking children in the main picnic area (don't worry the families don't venture on to the longer walks) and halve the walk times displayed on the guides. The other one I liked at Yanchep was the Rose-something-or-other, it goes out on to the other side of the main road and has some great views. A plus at Yanchep is you can have lunch and a beer at the pub afterwards.  The other one I really like is the Kitty's Gorge trail in Serpentine. The main trail head again has scream children but 5 minutes away from that it's quiet. Note the opposite end of the trail was a tad confusing (but entirely safe) as I think they were doing some works around what I think used to be/still is a camp site and it took me a bit to find the proper path.  The new DPAW website unfortunately does not have all the information as the old one, however the old one is still online with all the old PDFs with the maps. If you can't find them I've got a bunch in my dropbox for safe keeping.  Edit: To be a bit clearer what I was referring to as Kitty's Gorge trail is actually fairly short, however you can just keep going on what is technically another trail. In fact there are a whole bunch of other trails in that area that are not (well) documented on the new/old DPAW website or TrailsWA. This might make it sound scary if you've not bushwalked much before but really, just stick to the path, don't be an idiot and take some water and a rain jacket and you'll be fine. Worst case you can just turn around and go back the way you came."
perth,37x39t,Sytadel,2,Sun May 31 03:59:07 2015 UTC,"I think they were doing some works around what I think used to be/still is a camp site and it took me a bit to find the proper path.   Heh, yeah I did Kitty's Gorge with two friends a few years back - missed a trail turn-off and ended up following the O'Connor pipeline to some dam 22km away from the trail head. Got dark and had to hitch a ride back.  Also OP this is the website /u/yourspleenisshowing is referring to and it's pretty good. Eagle's View is probably the other good Perth trail. The other option is to just pick a section of the Bibbulman and do that. Here is the northernmost section.  If you're of even moderate fitness I'd highly recommend doing at least a 15km+ walk. The ""half-day"" walks like the Ghost Trail really only last about two hours or so. It's nice if you want to sleep in, have a leisurely drive, and get a late lunch on the way back though."
perth,37x39t,yourspleenisshowing,1 point,Sun May 31 04:25:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed on aiming for 15km for a decent walk. Be aware the distance for the ghost trail walk doesn't count getting to/from the ends of the trail though, so if you park at the visitors centre and go around the west side of the lake (which is well worth it, it's pretty) instead of using the concrete path to the east as the person in the visitor's centre tell you it's around 13km including ""taking the scenic route"" back to the car.  When I did Eagle's View there were loads of people running the trail (which is fine) and some people cycling on it (not fine), both really spoilt it a bit for me.  The other websites are http://parks.dpaw.wa.gov.au/ and I actually can't find the old one at the moment, it was from before they were split in two."

Centrally, there's Perth Zoo and Kings Park, but if you go a little further afield there's Whiteman Park, Araluen (if wildflowers are your thing), Yanchep.  Access to the more remote ones will require access to a car, so that partially factors in - the first two are very easily accessible via public transport.

Target have improved somewhat in recent times, but KMart and BigW particularly are still the place where the fit is going to match that bargain price (and not you).  And if it's dark or brightly coloured you might want to separate that wash pretty carefully for a few weeks. Haven't had that problem with Cotton On stuff."

perth,37tuco,akimboslices,7,Sat May 30 12:24:33 2015 UTC,Gentle reminder not to buy any asos branded stuff unless you're prepared for it to be garbage in 5 washes. Shocking quality.
perth,37tuco,andtheyloveit,3,Sat May 30 11:26:02 2015 UTC,"It's hit and miss, but I've found that one you figure out what's good and not good, it's worthwhile. I've bought shirts for $50 and $60 from YD, Roger David, and Myer, that lose their quality in that many washes. Hell, I bought a faux fur-lined winter jacket for $220 that the wind rips straight through.   I don't buy from retail clothing stores anymore, it's just not worth paying the ridiculous markup for the same or poorer quality. Plus, with asos you can return clothes because you just don't like them or they look different than you were led to believe on the website. That's more than I can say for any retail clothing store."
perth,37tuco,akimboslices,2,Sat May 30 12:40:32 2015 UTC,"Which retail stores are you going to that won't let you return your purchases? I guess my biggest grumble with ASOS is that they over-edit their images so unless it's black or white the colour you end up getting can be an unpleasant surprise. Also their clothes a completely overpriced for the quality/styles you get, and returns aren't free (you have to pay for P&H). Personally I don't have the luxury of having the time or money to ""miss"" when I buy a product online - at least in a retail store I can make a proper judgement for myself and return for free. You can generally immediately tell an item's quality the moment you see/try it on in store IMO. I mean, the other day I also bought a winter jacket for the same price as yours and it's absolutely amazing.  I'd also like to point out that Myer has a lot of its own brands which can be real shotty in quality. I'm not saying it can't be worthwhile if you know what you want/what's good, buuuut I still personally wouldn't risk it with ASOS branded clothing all the same. However ASOS can be good for other brands, if you know which ones you want."
perth,37tuco,probablynotink,3,Sat May 30 12:49:24 2015 UTC,Myer's. Scout around for the clearance racks.
perth,37tuco,yepthatjoe,3,Sat May 30 15:37:12 2015 UTC,"First of all, my opinions have slight bias as I'm a fat guy and as a result limited to stores that accommodate well in sizes. Still good general advice, though :)   Kmart has had excellent quality basics (tees mostly) lately, but ymmv, quality is really bad on some items as could be expected, especially if you're purchasing denim for $8 or $10. Same with Target. Stock varies in both really widely between stores.   Tarocash online is a good local site to keep an eye on as all their $99.99 RRP items inevitably drop to $30 or less after a couple months at full price. Good for pants, jeans, button up shirts (the rest are still overpriced, even when discounted) , and their online site has an excellent returns policy (free shipping over $75, and you can return in-store no questions asked). Almost always a rip-off in-store however, I've routinely bought stuff online reduced that is still full RRP in a nearby Tarocash store.  Topman / Zara ain't that great now the AUD is weak, at least compared to a few years ago. I imagine H&M will fare the same when they arrive in a few months."
perth,37tuco,nahcoob,2,Sat May 30 12:01:56 2015 UTC,"Dude, target and kmart are easy for basics that are in fashion. Good clothes that last ages and can cost bugger all. Being a bigger guy myself, I find they're a good place to go to as well."

perth,37swi9,AnAngryPacifist,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:48:31 2015 UTC,"For Indian, I go to Mela in Northbridge - tasty food, reasonably priced, Indian desserts too. Favourite restaurant. Another good one is the Bayleaf in Midland - if I didn't live so far from it now, it would probably still be my favourite.  For Japanese, I go to Dosukoi Ramen, which is located in Allen Square in the city, or in the Freo Markets. Closest to proper ramen you'll get in Perth, no other ramen shop compares. For Japanese food that isn't ramen, I'd go to Taka. It's not glamorous, but it isn't a rip-off like most Perth Japanese restaurants (so cheap), and tastes pretty good.  For Indonesian, Sweet Java in Mt Lawley is the best I've had, and the Hawker restaurants are pretty good for cheap and tasty Indo-Malay food.  For Mexican, I prefer Zapatas in Northbridge - great deals most days of the week, good service, good food, and try to avoid the Americanisation that a lot of Mexican restuarants suffer from. Their vegan nachos are awesome, this coming from a non-vegan.  For Korean, I go to Poppo - not very flashy, but for lunch in the city it's cheap, tasty and different. Bibimbap and kimchi jigae are the best they have to offer, and they also sell soju and sake for those who'd want to drink with friends.  As for Aussie/Western restaurants, I can't think of any worthy of mention. Most are far too overpriced and don't deliver the good food the price promises, so if I want something Aussie or Western like burgers or sausages I cook at home. Perth seriously has to pick up it's Aussie food game - if I want to show my foreign mates food that isn't mass produced American/Italian-American slop, I have to make it at home."

A bit difficult to enter because it's only one way but you enter from Williams Street in Gooseberry Hill which turns into Lascelles Parade and then eventually into Zig Zag Scenic Drive. The most amazing and incredible views of the city and the rest of Perth you will ever see.

Fremantle - Nowhere in particular, just the town as a whole. Always something interesting going on there. I recommend checking out East Fremantle if you want something a bit quieter with much cooler residents and people around. I used to work in East Fremantle for a couple of years so I can vouch for how awesome the people all are.   Point Walter Reserve - Located at the end of Point Walter Road in Bicton. Definitely one of my favourite parks of all time. The sandbar, one of the longest in the world, is a definite highlight as is the view all across the river to Peppermint Grove/Claremont."

perth,37o55b,nahcoob,2,Fri May 29 11:20:28 2015 UTC,"Even then I think it's a stretch calling it that. Sydney, Bangkok, LA, you go to ""Chinatown"" and signage changes to 100% Chinese script for six or seven city blocks, and as a white guy you're in the minority in terms of people walking on the street. Perth has no Chinatown - it has a small part of its entertainment district that has a higher than usual number of Asian businesses.   I would break it down into ""Chinatown"" for the shops and restaurants between just north of the Railway line and James street, then followed by more businesses on and beyond Francis Street, at which point you clearly enter into ""Little Vietnam"", as evidenced by the abundance of stores and restaurants involving Pho, words that are extremely hard to pronounce without a plum in your throat, and stores selling ""Ao Dais""...   Calling it Chinatown, however, I think is a stretch......  EDIT Don't get me wrong, I love this part of Perth, and as someone who grew up in an Asian country, I feel really comfortable with how it's part Chinatown, but also how so many whiteys are there clearly embracing the cuisine, culture, and cheap fruit and veg and dim sum. Perth's ""Chinatown"" is one of the cosiest I've had the pleasure of experiencing."

perth,37p73j,cro5point,3,Fri May 29 08:45:02 2015 UTC,"Telkomsel SimPATI is probably your best bet in most of Indonesia. You can buy the SIM card on the street once you arrive (avoid the airport, you'll get ripped off) for about $5-10, they will activate and set it up for you. If they try to charge you more than Rp. 100.000 for the SIM, go somewhere else.  Tell them how much data you need and they'll sort it out. It's pretty cheap, often you can get deals for $5-10 for 1-3GB with a 30 day expiry.  Also, Google it and you'll find a tonne of articles and posts from Whirlpool etc that should answer most of your questions.  The next biggest provider is XL, but they don't offer 4G/LTE yet. Telkomsel offers it only in the main tourist areas of Bali, everywhere else will be 2G/3G depending on how far out in the sticks you go.  Don't expect it to be fast like you are used to in Australia, even Vodafone here during it's 'vodafail' era still outperformed the networks there. They are often congested and very much hit and miss. All depends on your location and how many other people are using the network really."
perth,37p73j,itchyballz,2,Fri May 29 10:14:52 2015 UTC,I bought a sim card from a 711 or some place similar. It might also be worth signing up for a VPN if you don't already have one. That way you can be secure if you need to rely on unsecured wifi and you won't have to put up with Indonesia's censorship and web filtering.

The only skill they display is in throwing their spears, and this they certainly do with suprising (sic) precision... Like all Savages they are much addicted to theft, and appear to have no sense of gratitude for any favors that may be conferred upon them...

Took my bike in as the back wheel kept popping spokes, was an old wheel which has in its life popped 6 spokes. They recommended I replace the whole wheel. Took it back three times in a season because the same back wheel kept popping spokes. Asked for a replacement wheel never got it. After the fourth time it popped spokes I just ditched the whole bike as it was 15 years old anyway."
perth,37glmp,Untimely_Manner,2,Thu May 28 05:48:45 2015 UTC,"Once you ride on a wheel with a couple of busted spokes, it places undue stress on the remaining ones and thus their days are numbered due to the fatigue. You'll never get the balance of tension and tensile strength consistent between the old and new, and at the very least the wheel will likely need repeated re-truing.  I think Georges advice was sound in replacing the wheel.  Whether it was worth spending the money on the bike or not was probably the real question.  Service orientated stores are dwindling for this reason. People expect miracles for as little expenditure as possible. Whilst I won't claim Georges are perfect, they've been the most consistent for me; but for the sake of other stores being a lot worse and maybe for the want of any specific tool, I do 99% of my own stuff these days anyway."
perth,37glmp,CyanideRemark,1 point,Thu May 28 06:59:31 2015 UTC,"You lost me there, I had the whole thing replaced. The entire wheel, the spokes, the tread. So it should have all been brand new. To then pop spokes 3 times after apparently being fixed each time. Yes I expect something brand new to work? I did also ask should I buy a more expensive one as this one keeps breaking, they said no. I asked are you sure maybe it is not my weight. I am 120 kilos. They said no, they just kept fixing the popped spokes. Which though great they kept fixing it. I had to keep organising to get the bike there and back each time as it could not last a week riding it. Not to knock your experience though, I just seemed to have a bad run with them but they do seem busy all the time which would usually indicate good service."
perth,37glmp,Untimely_Manner,1 point,Thu May 28 09:25:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, I read it as they wanted to replace it but you held off with a few subsequent spoke replacements on the original wheel.  Just out of curiosity - what sort of wheel was it? Road? MTB? 700c? Spoke count? Your body weight?  I started popping more spokes on certain combos when my body weight crept up over 100kg so I lean towards higher spoke counts and/or sturdier profile rims.  Often some shops will overlook a riders weight and likely riding style and not consider the stock spec wheels on some model bikes, particularly road bikes and the owner will have grief with their wheels."

perth,37glmp,Untimely_Manner,2,Thu May 28 09:36:46 2015 UTC,"Smaller wheels like those of the (older) 26"" MTB wheels are generally tougher given the same number of spokes than bigger roadie wheels, and are a little more forgiving.  For similar reasons it's why 20"" BMX wheels can take such a hammering from teenagers.  But that is bad advice. Even then, I'd question the quality of the wheel they sold you. Having said that though, it's not the sort of thing I'd put past any number of other stores.  One of the main reasons I got into my own maintenance (and subsequent hobby) was because inconsistent service.

Your absolute best bet is to get your AMSA Certificate of Safety Training, previously known as the STCW95. This actually allows you to work on any near coastal or open water vessel in Australia (And with a couple of other small tickets, the world). Thing is, it costs about $2500 but you can get it from Challenger Tafe in Fremantle (Oh sorry, Challenger Institute of Technology).   Your other option is to get the General Purpose Hand ticket which is of lower value than the CoST but also costs less - usually around $1000. As far as I can tell, Challenger also run this course but for the life of me, I can't find it on their website - your best option is to give them a call.   TLDR: You can't just start working on a boat these days - you gotta have a ticket. Ticket's cost money. In saying that, it's a very rewarding career pathway and there are many options and directions you can take once you're on it.   Source: I am the training coordinator of a marine company :P"

The town tries... but meh..  Busselton foreshore in Geographe Bay, probably, yes - but you're 4/5ths of the way there then.  Do the return drive via Caves Road, calling int at Yallingup etc. Meelup Beach less than 10km detour from Dunsborough is a personal favourite of mine  Other than that I merely recommend concentrating on the road whilst driving."
perth,37ao9t,CyanideRemark,7,Tue May 26 05:54:06 2015 UTC,"Bunbury nah. The town tries... but meh..   There is actually a beautiful fruit & veg place on the main highway that does great coffee (Bunbury Farmers Market - look it up on Google Maps). Lots of great fresh produce too and people offering taste test of free meat/cheese. I would say this is the first thing worth stopping for though - the drive down to Bunbury is horrible, but it's pretty nice thereafter. The farmers market is about your half-way mark, so good spot to stop for a bite/coffee.  OP, if you're happy to extend the drive, consider going in-land via. Nannup and Balingup. The Nannup/Balingup road along the Blackwood is beautiful, as is the Nannup/Bridgetown road through the hills. It'll add about 90 minutes to your trip though."

perth,37ao9t,CyanideRemark,2,Tue May 26 10:26:48 2015 UTC,"Well.. without deviating too much further from the loose theme of getting from Perth to Margaret River; but similar to the Bunbury Coastal & inlet deviation above, you can turn off of the main road North of Capel at Roberts Road and come out in the Ludlow Tuart forest and approach Busselton via Wonnerup Tuart Drive & Layman Road.  Just subtle no cost options, other than a bit of time out of your drive.   Return drive via a little more southerly direction via Pemberton and the big timber. It's amazing the amount of West Aussies, let alone others, that don't realise the beautiful big forests we have in the South West. Go and breathe some of the beautiful air among the giants. Plenty of different length walks available if you ask at local Tourist Bureaus and and Info centres 'round there.  [edit Updated road names that have changed since my time down there]"

The walks get better the further away from Perth you get. As far as coffee places in Bunbury, no favourites really, most of it comes down to the view, which is unfortunately Dome Cafe looking out across the harbour, or Noovoh Backbeach, which is on the Back Beach.  There's also a lookout tower on the top of Marlston Hill which overlooks the city from the other side of the Maidens Reserve."

Ample oppurtunity for stopping in small towns like Pinjarra, Waroona, Harvey, Brunswick as well.

perth,37ao9t,ASisko,3,Tue May 26 15:07:41 2015 UTC,"The last time I went down for a few days I had a voucher for a winery in the Capel River area which is between Bunbury and Busselton. So I took a detour from Bunbury to Donnybrook (take the South West highway from Bunbury insead of the Bussel Highway). From Donnybrook you get on the Capel-Donnybrook Road to get back to the main coastal highway. Anyway, the whole detour was well worthwhile imo as the scenery and terrian is much more interesting and pleasant to drive through than the highway. I wont spoil it by trying to describe it but in general it is greener and more hilly with a glen and dale kind of vibe (you are up on the escarpment). Also Donnybrook is a fruitgrowing area which has some interesting effects on the agricultural landscape.  If you don't stop I think it would probably add 30-40 minutes to the trip but I stopped and had lunch in the winery (Oakway Estate) and was pretty happy about it. Also the wine was quite good (and I did a fair bit of tasting on this trip).  If you have to stop in Bunbury for lunch I highly recommend The Happy Wife which is very easy to access off the Forrest Highway as you are passing through town.  This time of year, you don't want to go to the beach.  As for the drive from Perth-Bunbury, take the new Forrest Highway, not any other way. The start of Forrest Highway bypasses Mandurah entirely (it is hardly any distance from Perth anway) so you won't be stopping there. Do not try to take South West Highway as they have insanely low speed limits for km on either side of every town.  In fact the speed limit thing comes up again about 10km outside of Bunbury where it drops to 80km/h despite it being the same highway or better as the one you have been cruising on at 110km/h for the last hour. It's maddening. Thankfully once you are south of Busselton they have 90km/h speed limits all over the place (even on backroads) and I find getting around that SW corner is very easy. It takes harly any time to do the Margaret River - Busselton run for example.  But yeah, basically taking the main highway Perth-Busselton there is nothing to see, do or eat along the way. It takes 3 hours. Bunbury is a decent place to stop for a bite of your choice and is only 2-2.5 hours from Perth (fast food on the main highway or nicer cafe/restraunt if you look around). Mandurah is only 50 minutes from Perth and not worth visiting anwyway. Once you are at Busselton you are basically all the way to Margaret River anyway, so stopping there depends on whether or not you plan to visit on another day during your stay in the SW."
perth,37ao9t,CyanideRemark,1 point,Tue May 26 10:03:48 2015 UTC,"in general it is greener    Only if you don't do it in the heat of summer. Everything is dead.  Whilst I agree about South West H'ways speed 'undulations' it also is a little narrower and shitty road with mostly single lane - it's a lot more scenic in the foot hills of the Darling Ranges. You pass through a lot more smaller towns like Pinjarra, Waroona, Harvey and Brunswick Junction. More casual oppurtunities to stop between Perth metro & Bunbury en route than the Forest H'way."

perth,37ao9t,arkofjoy,4,Tue May 26 09:04:15 2015 UTC,"I think they mean the Miami bakehouse caravan.  The Miami bakehouse is an awesome bakery that used to be on the main route along the coast to bunbury.  When they extended the freeway from Perth to bunbury, the bakehouse was essentially chopped out of the route.   Instead of just rolling over and dying they set up a caravan almost exactly halfway to bunbury and sell their pies etc from that.   Its a staple on any of my trips down south, I recommend it highly."

perth,37ao9t,jumpinjezz,1 point,Tue May 26 16:34:40 2015 UTC,"Here it is. It's right on the corner of Paull Road. Even with the odd banner & flag, it's a pretty non-descript little place. It looks just like the Bakery have leased the corner of a farm paddock and set up shop. Indeed, from memory there's some Dairy looking sheds directly behind it and what may throw people unless they're deliberately looking for the joint.  I get the impression the Bakery maybe hanging out for more permanent digs at a Servo or similar around the Old Bunbury Road rest area if & when they finally eventuate.  Heading south, Paull Road is the next intersection across Forest H'way after Greenlands Road.  I dunno. It's OK, I suppose, but I think it's more novelty joint for the metropolitan based people who only do the 'big drive' infrequently. Having grown up doing the trip to and fro, to and fro from down South, I tend to get irritated by the stop just for the sake of a pie."

There's a sign for a place on the way down that does wine, beers and ciders! I'd try that.   We went to one dairy place that was disappointing, we were hoping for local chocolate milk. The smoked cheddar was delicious, but I can't recall the name of the place.   For chocolate liquors and foods definitely try the Providore. I did not try the liquors but I tried all 40+ of their samples. I'm so sorry for my use of plastic spoons   Also you may have winery suggestions but also check out the place that does Nougat liquor!  The nougat liquor place, Providore, and Margaret River Chocolate Co are all pretty close to each other. Actually once you get down there almost all the wineries are close together.   OH! And go to the coffee place! It's call Yahava, they have a bunch of coffees to taste and some lovely people who help walk you through the tastings.   Edit: While you're there might as well drive the extra 35 min from Margaret River to the lighthouse in Augusta. It's basically the South West corner of Australia. When I went the lighthouse was closed but it was still nice, especially as the sun was setting."

The position comes back to who is shunted into that role - from the political party rank and file; not Joe Blow/Citizen X/Community Leader Y etc.   Point being - all Ministers are Party (and Cabinet) members.  We, as the plebs, only vote for our ""local representatives"" at State & Federal level in a compulsory manner. These local/regionals/area Party representatives collectively themselves within their party chose their leader who becomes the Premier or Prime Minister. Hence why there was all that argy-bargy shit with Rudd & Gillard.  Partially also why the media was baying for a stoush with Abbot & Turnbull some months back  The party in opposition similarly elects their ""leader"" and ""shadow"" ministers.  Demographically, you'll find a majority - but not all - of professional State politicians come from legal or journo backgrounds."

perth,36ysyi,Macka94,1 point,Sat May 23 09:14:35 2015 UTC,"I think the 103 key version removes the right windows key so that the space bar is a little wider and there are three equally spaced modifiers on either side of the space, rather than three keys on the left and four on the right with the 104 key layout."

Some ISP's will auto resubmit the application for you so you don't need to call up.  In the business we call it the Port Lottery, basically because that is what it is, especially if you are on a RIM (tophatted or not) because there are less ports than even a basic exchange.  The longest wait time I have seen for a customer waiting on a port was just over 14 months, that was Baldivis I think."

A trip like Peru is a pretty decent undertaking, so I would recommend at least getting a second opinion from an agent. Yes, there are some shitty agents out there, but in my opinion, when you find a good one, stick to them! And I certainly have.

perth,36r315,renstimpy,2,Thu May 21 16:45:52 2015 UTC,"I just did a quick Google and came up with http://southamericatravelcentre.com.au/ - they're based in Melbourne but are atas certified and are specialists. You'd be able to call and email with what you want. Unless you can find a Perth agent who has been to Peru, they'd be your best bet."
perth,36r315,JungleMuffin,2,Fri May 22 00:12:25 2015 UTC,"None of them, they get commission.   I did my research prior to seeing a travel agent a few years back, and she gave me a price significantly higher than what the airline had advertised on their website, which took me 30 seconds to Google.   They're the used car salesman of the tourism industry, do it yourself."
perth,36r315,InanimateObject4,2,Thu May 21 13:54:29 2015 UTC,Ex Travel Agent here. There is little commission to earn these days so you charge fees and mark up fares to make money.
perth,36r315,Oaty_Slice,1 point,Fri May 22 00:28:35 2015 UTC,Would they literally mark up the price of flights that are just available through the various websites? Or is there some special back door that the agent can use to book the flight that others can't?
perth,36r315,nahcoob,1 point,Fri May 22 09:06:27 2015 UTC,"They have direct access to the various booking systems (e.g Amadeus) - the kickback/markup varies, and isn't necessarily the same as the online price. Most of the time it'll be higher, but the larger travel chains (which is mainly flight centre these days as they have almost monopolised the market) will sometimes be able to offer something cheaper then what's available online - but then you have to endure the hard sell, which is unpleasant at best.   I had a Flight Centre voucher to use a couple years ago and had to be extremely firm because I just wanted to book a tour for them that they had a bigger discount on then what was available online (about $500 cheaper) and I experienced a good 15mins of attempts to upsell me to get me to book flights, hotels, travel insurance with them. I hadn't asked for their help past booking the tour, but the end result was a consultant who seemed annoyed that I didn't want anything else. The hard sell is why I can't stand using them more then the mark-up."

In WA, it's clearly a local government issue at the current time, so I agree 100% there.   One of the interesting things about the ban, a lot of retailers source paper bags that do not come from recycled paper, and are treated with strong chemicals to prevent bugs, etc from eating them. My old boss (who was an environmentalist on an extreme scale) always used to say that the paper bags that most retailers actually used were far, far worse for the environment then most of the plastic bags on the market today (which are biodegradable, and which many people reuse for garbage, etc), so unless retailers were only permitting reusable bags, he said that these bans didn't really help the environment much at all."
perth,36pdzn,nahcoob,3,Thu May 21 03:36:58 2015 UTC,"Paper bags require 5-10 times more energy to produce, so in one sense they are worse.

To use wireless, you have to buy either the dongle separately (good luck finding one) or the controller with the dongle, which is called Xbox 360 Controller for PC.  To adjust the buttons, dead zones, etc, you just go into game controllers section and change the settings, like a joystick. I think you can also download some additional software to do it, but it's not necessary.  I use a wireless controller with the dongle on my PC and just plugged it in, let it install drivers automatically and everything just works, even the rumble works.  /edit Ozgameshop is where I bought my controller from."

perth,36manu,codemonk,1 point,Wed May 20 15:43:51 2015 UTC,I think u/_cephei touched on all the major problems with the organisation.  You should seriously consider point 4 - I almost fell into the same trap while doing my degree.
perth,36manu,Whewt,17,Thu May 21 02:58:54 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that the ACS are a standing joke amongst actual IT professionals; the whole if-you-don't-have-a-degree-then-you-can't-work-in-IT crap that they've been peddling for years just goes to show how out of touch they are with the industry that they claim to represent.   If anyone wants further entertaining reading, have a gander at the ACS's stance on 457 visas and the alleged 'IT skills shortage' - and you can dry the 'skills shortage' out and use it to fertilise your lawn when you're done.  For those considering ACS membership - save your money, and put it towards SAGE-AU instead, who are an organisation that actually gets out there and advocates for their members. Don't believe the hyperbole that the ACS recruiters would have you believe. It's entirely possible to have a successful, productive and fulfilling career in IT without ever needing their membership or services.  TL;DR = The only ACS event you'll see me at is the liquidation auction. Bring on the down votes!"
perth,36manu,codemonk,-1,Wed May 20 15:22:48 2015 UTC,"Well, that was interesting. The ACS doesn't require you to have a qualification to be a member, just be a good citizen in the community and try and uphold their ethos, nothing to onerous I would think.  I didn't come on here to try and sell the ACS. I come here to ask for peoples to input into an event I am trying to run, which with the input of people would hopefully be a good event.  It sounds like you have had a bad experience in the past and I am sorry for that but no need to be so negative.  I think any professional organisation is worth joining, I haven't heard anything about SAGE-AU but I'm sure if they provide services for their members they would be a great organisation."
perth,36manu,Whewt,2,Wed May 20 15:42:14 2015 UTC,"I think the commenters on this thread are essentially just trying to warm you, in a helpful way.  They just come across as aggressive because the ACS has been polluting the industry for awhile now.   I think any professional organisation is worth joining   Not really.  If you're applying for a job, and you have ACS membership listed on your resume, I'd start questioning your understanding of the industry."
perth,36manu,codemonk,3,Thu May 21 03:05:07 2015 UTC,"Im not saying to join the ACS here if its not to your taste. But there are many different professional organisations out there. SAGE-AU, WAIA, AWIA to name a few.   Joining one is a way to show that you are active in your industry. Unless its all professional organisations that the problem?"
perth,36manu,_cephei,4,Thu May 21 03:50:42 2015 UTC,"But there are many different professional organisations out there. SAGE-AU, WAIA, AWIA to name a few.   All of whom do a damn sight better job at representing the interests of their members and the industry as a whole.  They're also cheaper than the ACS.  They've also got a longer list of 'perks' than the ACS (SAGE-AU mailing lists are awesome, just FYI).  They also attract nowhere near the level of hate as the ACS (per /u/codemonk - my interview experience with those who tout their ACS membership has been less than satisfactory compared to those from, say, SAGE-AU).  Not all professional organisations are bad. Most do wonderful jobs - but some garner a special level of hatred for the way they have tried to screw their members/industry over in the past... and the ACS is one of those."

But ACS isn't taken seriously by the majority of the IT industry, for the reasons stated.  If you're at university and looking to show that you are active in the industry, you honestly would be better off looking almost anywhere else."
perth,36manu,Muzorra,7,Thu May 21 04:32:25 2015 UTC,"The ACS is composed of managerial rent-seekers who wouldn't know what real IT is like if it bit them in the ass. Let's review their record:   Agitating so that all IT workers are registered with a professional organisation. Which organisation? Why, the ACS of course! If they managed to get this, imagine how much money they'd be rolling in from all the forced membership fees. Support of government-proposed internet filters and data retention. I hope I don't need to go into why these are bad ideas. +1 to everything /u/Whewt said, especially about the 457 visas. They try to attract young people because they're the only ones who haven't been in the industry to realise it's a bullshit organisation.  Rejecting people from membership because they don't have formal qualification (relates to #1 a bit) I might be the minority with this one but having attended an event it being assumed I am there as a supporting wife and not because I myself am in the IT industry.   Some further reading  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5142872  http://delimiter.com.au/2013/02/01/morons-freelancer-ceo-wants-acs-disbanded/  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5148728   Back in 2001 I contacted the ACS to discuss some policy things and was horrified to discover the “experts” I was talking to were nothing more than accountants. Later they elected a lawyer as president, and then a recruiter, prompting me to publicly condemn the ACS as a fake during the period 2004 – 2006. The ACS is actually an anti-professional organisation. Their agenda is not to promote computer science or engineering expertise, but rather to allow pretenders to hide in the generic vagueness of “ICT Professional.” They actually work to devalue real expertise, since engineers and computer scientists pose a threat to accountants, MBAs and lawyers who want to claim membership of the technology professions."
perth,36manu,MexicanSpaceProgram,1 point,Thu May 21 02:07:51 2015 UTC,"Those where some interesting articles, the Delimiter one was a good read. My problem is that they are from quite a few years ago?  The ACS isn't perfect, but no professional bodies are. I am talking about the Perth branch, and we are trying to make the Young IT segment more relevant for young IT professionals.  The ACS is an open membership, all you need is for someone to vouch that your a good member of the community, is that too much to ask for?  The ACS Membership gives you access to events and professional development, and also give personal Indemnity insurance for its members if you earn less then $20000 a year doing IT contracting.  I go to the ACS to network with other IT professionals. There are a lot of young people there, and most people are generally friendly and will have a chat, offer advice or help if they can.  As with any of these things a lot of the time you get out what you put in. If you wanted to you can nominate, be elected and then contribute to the running of the state chapter, and have real influence on the things the ACS does for its members here."

The ACS Membership gives you access to events and professional development, and also give personal Indemnity insurance for its members if you earn less then $20000 a year doing IT contracting.   Not entirely true. The 'Associate' Tier is an open-isn membership, as you say, however to get any of the 'benefits' (and I use that term loosely) such as PubLi from ACS membership, you need to be a 'Member'.  Now, let's have a look at the Membership Guidelines:   The Member grade is awarded to all members who have qualified at any stage for certification as a Certified Technologist, Certified Professional or Certified Master Practitioner (see Guidelines for Certification). A member applying to be regraded to Member will be considered to have applied for certification and on achieving certification will automatically be admitted to Member and the Professional Division.   Cool, so let's have a look at the Certification Guidelines. Assuming we go for the 'Certified Technologist' level, we need to meet the following:   ICT degree – normal & accredited - 1 year of experience, and not required to demonstrate knowledge of ICT. ICT degree – normal & not accredited - 2 years of experience, and required to demonstrate knowledge of ICT. Non-ICT degree - 4 years of experience, and required to demonstrate knowledge of ICT. Vendor certification - 4+ years of experience, and required to demonstrate knowledge of ICT. Experience only - 7 years of experience, and required to demonstrate knowledge of ICT.   Lotsa work to achieve access to a little PubLi insurance (that, for the record, can be had for less than the cost of an ACS membership). Not to mention that the ACS rates someone with a Uni Degree and 1 year of experience to be the same level as someone with 7 years of experience... if that's not a warped view of the industry, then I don't know what is.  EDIT: To clarify, I'm not belittling Uni degrees. They're great tools and have their place - but in a dynamic, evolving industry like IT, they're far too focused on old-hat tech and theory, rather than introducing new concepts and getting students into hands-on education. The current crop of degrees are also far too focused on churching out programmers and BAs rather than infrastructure personnel... but that's another issue for another post.  If you want to network with other professionals, why not find a user group? I get a lot more value out of things like VMUG, SAGE-AU and WAIA than I ever would out of the ACS.  Can I ask what Degree you're studying?"
perth,36manu,aussiekinga,2,Thu May 21 04:09:48 2015 UTC,"I studied many years ago a now defunct degree in e-commerce at ECU about 10 years ago. I worked in small business sector for an IT firm supporting many industries for 6 years before I started working in education teaching Networking at Polytechnic West.  I still do some consulting for small business's to keep up with some technologies but I know I won't be regarded as a professional in some eyes, even though I have a lot of experience with Microsoft, VMware and Cisco.  I network with other IT professionals to try and keep current of what people are doing in Perth so when I teach these skills to my students I am teaching them somewhat relevant."

Its good for addicts to know that there is a way out :)  I knew a lot of people who did hard drugs when I was younger and its amazing, now that we are all old farts, how many of them are just suburban mums and dads.  But when you're 20 or 21 or 22 and right in the thick of it, you can't always see that there's a way out - a way through. I had friends who were, quite literally, junkie prostitutes - who are now on their school's P & C committees.  Stories like this give people hope - I think all the harping on about how destructive this is, or how  addictive that is,  are unhelpful.   Junkies know that the drugs they take are addictive and destructive - they're living it. They need to know that there can be a clean, clear and normal at the end of it to aim for.

I gather that Google Maps have something similar, but last time I checked you could only download small portions at a time because they had licensing issues?

perth,36h91b,The_Valar,0,Tue May 19 11:49:57 2015 UTC,This. It is true unfortunately. With the ever increasing traffic on our freeways it's imperative one finds ways to get to one's destination quickly. I find I can shave off around 30 seconds by not getting involved in a stop-go situation that occurs on the lanes next to the exit lane. I do however ensure that I'm constantly moving and always swiftly merge back ASAP without creating a dangerous situation.

Luckily I don't go that direction often.  Merging lanes is so much better in peak hour than exits like this. At least with merging you have the same right of way as the lane you're merging into, whereas this just forces you to try and change lanes on a road where drivers go out of their way to block you from doing it. It relies on drivers being courteous and letting you in, which is a rarity in Perth."
perth,36h91b,sickofawwandcats,1 point,Tue May 19 23:51:01 2015 UTC,"I love people who do this sort of shit. It's like you have two choices, you can cop the fact that you were too slow to get out of the exit lane - just exit and turn around somewhere to re-enter the freeway. This inconveniences ONLY YOU.  OR you can be a selfish dickhead and halt all traffic around you while you timidly wait with your indicator on saying 'please let me in' - this inconveniences EVERYONE EXCEPT YOU.  It's hard to believe people can choose the second option without realising they are a selfish idiot, but it seems a lot of people do. If you're one of those people, go fuck yourself."
perth,36h91b,dukeofwhales,1 point,Fri May 22 05:27:07 2015 UTC,Does anyone know why the lane is designed this way?  There's plenty of space to have a merge after the exit like most lane merges.  Exiting lanes are usually only used when the lane is added at the previous on ramp.
perth,36h91b,aussiekinga,3,Tue May 19 11:49:13 2015 UTC,The merge after exit is apparently something you don't find often outside of Perth and it actually works against traffic flow. A properly utilised exit only ramp provides better traffic flow over all.  I don't recall all the details but I remember reading a report by subject matter experts from the UK basically telling MRWA to get rid of all the 'merge after exit' points.
perth,36h91b,tw33kz0r,1 point,Tue May 19 13:20:13 2015 UTC,"that would probably be true if all the exits were the same, but when the majority are one type and a few are the other, it's going to cause confusion."

perth,36h91b,tw33kz0r,2,Wed May 20 00:29:19 2015 UTC,I believe that is for converting merging lanes to priority merge (not sure the proper name - but the on ramp lane is forced to merge over into the right lane instead of both lanes just stopping eg northbound armadale road )
perth,36h91b,mrtuna,0,Wed May 20 00:44:34 2015 UTC,The two kilometres of 'left lane must exit' confuses you?
perth,36h91b,nahcoob,1 point,Fri May 22 04:06:34 2015 UTC,"Because they're trying to remove merge points (as well as beginning to change existing merge points to give way style merges rather than zipper merges) on the Freeway, and this is a way to do it. It seems to work a lot better further up the freeway at Hodges Drive, but the hutton one is not so good. The signage was initially poor at Hutton but after they put an overhead gantry style sign in,  no more excuses imo."
perth,36h91b,dukeofwhales,1 point,Tue May 19 15:11:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I had noticed the move away from zipper merges (which is strange because I was under the impression that studies showed that it was the most efficient way to merge).  The issue with exiting lanes & eastern-states style merges is if you have an exit lane/on ramp moving very slowly and other lanes moving normally you can't build up enough speed to safely merge.
perth,36h91b,nahcoob,1 point,Wed May 20 00:17:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen that same study too - I'm guessing it's either in the name of national standardisation or they have info from the trials on some of the offramps Kwinana Fwy northbound to indicate that it's more effective.  I agree with that entirely as I've come across that situation many times on the Berrigan Dr offramp To Kwinana Fwy North - having to floor it because the car(s) in front are still ""merging"" but doing no more then 70km/h with very little lane left before it cuts off."
perth,36h91b,aussiekinga,1 point,Wed May 20 00:24:56 2015 UTC,"The new MRWA Managing Director is a Queenslander. It was once he came on board that the change of merge style, to the eastern states style, was pushed through.  There was a small trial running, but it was not running long enough for any reasonable results to be received before the change was further rolled out."
perth,36h91b,lordsnipe,1 point,Wed May 20 04:04:38 2015 UTC,"The Kwinana Fwy northbound trial (on Berrigan, Beeliar and Russell) hasn't made one iota of difference to the traffic. People aren't giving way on those ramps in the first place. Having a 'modified merge' sign does nothing if the users don't know what they're meant to do. A big GIVE WAY sign might help."
perth,36h91b,nahcoob,1 point,Wed May 20 04:20:23 2015 UTC,"You're right, especially at night... or in newly surfaced parts of the freeway that don't even have a sign telling the driver that it's changed (Reid Offramp to Mitchell Southbound).  I've actually (incredibly) seen similar treatment that you describe at the exit lane at Hutton - last weekend late night in the rain I saw someone in the exit lane for Hutton just keep driving, across the traffic island, into the emergency lane and merge as if it was a zipper merge type of setup. Was kind of funny actually."

We saw all kinds of crap there - kids with clearly stolen credit cards, drug addicts bleeding everywhere in the toilets, drunks hurling racial abuse, the same people coming back again and again to try and rip us off, homeless people walking half-naked through the store - add all of that on top of some of the insane people they hired and the openly racist and abusive management, and you might be able to imagine how horrible a job it is.

perth,36bqvo,showmanic,6,Mon May 18 04:03:46 2015 UTC,"Because the law is toothless. This is because the world if full of PC crybabies who instead of blaming the individual, will blame anything they can shake their finger at."
perth,36bqvo,photowest,3,Mon May 18 04:51:48 2015 UTC,"As someone who completely exploited the limp-wristed and ineffective juvenile justice system*, I wholeheartedly agree.  The law is often toothless when dealing with fully grown adults, but with young offenders this effect is amplified ten-fold. They learn very early on, that as long as the crime isn't a very high-level assault or something that puts innocents at physical risk like stealing a car and driving unlicensed, they're at pretty much no risk of incarceration. Fairly sure the majority of kids in banksia, rangeview etc are there on serious violence related charges alone.  The worst the average young offender would be looking at is community service, counselling or support education groups, having to report in once a week at a cop shop, nearly completely unmonitored and unenforced curfews and other similarly ineffective ""punishments"" that are quite often worn as badges of pride by the offender anyway. Apparently, to some, picking up rubbish in a fluoro vest on the side of the road gives them extra street cred.   Regardless, to most, they aren't the slightest bit of a deterrent. I was a little shit for a while growing up (not violent though) and I was pretty scared of the idea of being sent to juvenile detention (not that I'd have admitted it out loud, but there were always scary stories and urban myths) but really not much else, if anything.  Once I'd learned that my indiscretions weren't likely to ever land me locked up or be held over me once I'd turned 18, I honestly didn't give a fuck.   Community service, drug group counselling (which usually just consists of dropkicks sitting in a circle telling ""cool"" stories and subtly trying to one-up eachother while pretending to be remorseful about it, when actually they're just networking), curfews, educational propaganda videos etc was all no sweat whatsoever, and like I said before, just added to street cred (in the mind of the 15 yr old rebel).  Fortunately for me, my naive plan to ""clean myself up"" by 18 and cease all of my illegal activities ""when it actually counts"" somehow managed to be successful. I'm lucky enough to be sitting here today telling you this as a (mostly) respectable, law-abiding person.  AS much as that sounds like it could be a case for going lightly on juveniles because they might eventually get their shit together one day too, I feel it's more so the opposite. I did it all because I knew I could get away with it and had figured out how to safely avoid my only deterrent. I'd effectively been taught that there were no consequences and nothing matters for real until adulthood, like a free-pass to break the law up until a certain point. It proved true, too.  I'm not saying we need to rule over kids with an iron fist and throw them all behind bars over every little discretion, but it is plain to see that the current measures are ineffective to the point of being counter productive. Punishments need to more specifically reflect the crime, the offender and the intended lesson or message which is sent not just to the offender, but to any potential future offenders too.  Easier said than done, I know. I guess a good start would be to more seriously look into punishments to identify what actually is and isn't a deterrent, how much it varies between demographics, identify which factors affect or dictate this, and develop a law comprehensive/flexible enough to apply tailored punishments that fit not just the crime, but the overall situation and desired outcomes too. The whole ""free-pass"" until 18 idea needs to be eradicated too, not by making juvenile records permanent or anything so extreme, but perhaps by adding conditions or extra citeria required to obtain the clean-slate?  There are probably no easy answers. But there is a better way to deal with this issue, that much I do know."

perth,36co6j,MrD33,11,Mon May 18 09:21:30 2015 UTC,"Shop around. Naturally IGAs and grocers in areas that have a high average income (in your case, Carine and South Duncraig - I.e the Carine IGA you mentioned as well as the very fancy Delicatessen that's next to it) and Gwelup to the south of you, which is a Supa IGA and again a fancy Deli next to it) are going to over charge for their groceries, especially F&V.  You're relatively close to Innaloo - I'd suggest going to Spudshed, as well as the several greengrocers that are in that general area (there is one in Westfield, one opposite spudshed and one in the smaller centre out the front of Westfield on Scarb Bch Rd). There is also an excellent greengrocer (Balcatta Growers Fresh) just on the corner of Karrinyup Rd and Jones St that isn't too far away either.  In terms of the duopoly, I live very close to the area you describe and the Coles and greengrocer at Greenwood S/C are reasonably priced.  If you can't drive, Warwick Grove S/C is the closest major centre to you - I will guarantee you that it will be far cheaper the the shops at Carine Glades - every shop in that centre that sells food overcharges by a mile compared to all surrounding shopping centres.  Tldr - Shop around, do not rely on IGAs or fancy Deli's in high income areas or you will get ripped off. Do not expect IGAs to have uniform pricing except for catalogue specials."

If we privatize it they can pretty much charge whatever they want and we have no choice but to pay it as there is no alternative. So we would probably end up building another port somewhere else to compete with it or purchasing it back from the buyer at an inflated price.  Furthermore I question why we are spending tens of billions on new road projects that ultimately funnel more trucks into the Freo port when we are looking at selling it at the same time, as these upgrades are completed one would assume the value of the port would rise so this would be the worst time to sell it..   Just look at the airport; we flogged it off and now the government is spending countless amounts on new road projects to feed traffic into the airport and giving them grants and stuff.... wtf did we even sell it for if it's still our responsibility to fund it?"

Just because WA doesn't have the mindset of /r/Australia doesn't mean it's staunchly conservative, especially when Labor, at least on a federal level has staunchly neglected WA for the last 2 elections because they're chasing support in QLD and Western Sydney - and don't forget how many people voted for Ludlum in the senate reelection...  We were the most progressive state in the whole damn country 10 years ago after state Labor got in, Gallop was an incredible premier. Shame Carpenter ballsed it up as badly as he did (complacency was the reason Barnett won, Labor assumed they'd won the election before it was even announced - and nobody expected Barnett to win it considering his bizarre water canal idea lost him the election only a few years prior) and McGowan isn't any better then carps was by a long shot. Honestly next state election both parties will have a tough time with promises considering the state debt. I'll be surprised if metronet makes a return for Labor (despite it been a fantastic, visionary idea) considering the states finances.  I've said it a million times on here already, compared to VIC and QLD libs who just got voted out, Barnett has been significantly better. God help us if Barnett decided to do a Campbell Newman once this deficit hit and cancel every project and sack half the public servant workforce. While he's not fantastic by any means, he's not as bad as he really could be.

perth,3680ut,The_Valar,1 point,Sun May 17 05:30:16 2015 UTC,"This does make slightly more sense in a way:  -build a giant toll road, thing that doesn't need to be there  -sell it off as a money farm to some folks.  -Leave them with the responsibility of pushing more product through the terminal to raise the numbers.  -Sell off the terminal as well.  -Government washes its hands of the whole thing.  -Profit?  Eh, after the toll and the port fees etc have gone up a few times once the numbers don't pan out maybe.  Ok maybe it doesn't make sense.  But the idea of one thing being used to increase the value of the other sorta does. I still think Abbott wants the giant toll road to be Australia's future and wants them in every city.  Why I can only guess:  He's not English after all,  he's American maybe?  As a child his parents only let him watch late 40s/early 50s corporate videos from General Motors and the Jetsons?  Neo Liberal economics in government is a slow death spiral for the state financing itself, so to avoid the anathema of taxing people properly you've got to get innovative in hiding the ways you get money from the populace.  User pays road travel is one way?  I don't know.  I fish around the various options.  The only real point is making sure we stop this thing somehow."
perth,3680ut,Muzorra,2,Mon May 18 00:55:03 2015 UTC,"Consider that the rest of the road (not the stock/leach/high section) that is part of this proposed freightlink toll road is very much needed - Roe 8 will solve a major freeway issue with cars and trucks that were mainly destined for Stock Rd or Freo taken off clogging the freeway - this will be just as beneficial if the Kwinana port is built in the future - and then of course the Northlink section (extending Tonkin Hwy north past Ellenbrook. Connecting with Brand/GH Hwy) is despatately needed considering the very poor quality of the road connections to Ellenbrook and Bullsbrook.  As has been addressed in other threads it's not the whole toll road project that's the issue, it's really just the end part, especially High St as this is the most difficult and expensive part, yet it has never been planned or mentioned previously by MRWA nor is it in the amended Stephenson Plan.  Back on topic though - if there was solid plans for a second port to be built in Kwinana, then sure - sell Freo off and use Kwinana as the primary port - but as we know with this and the ham fistedness of the odd part of the freightlink project (Leach Hwy/High St) that doesn't seem like it's going to happen.  But yeah, asset sales give politicians a hard on cause its all about the short term - money now, and who cares about the consequences. The state of airports not just in WA but all over Australias major cities prove that this kind of infrastructure shouldn't be sold off."

I can see why they want it and there aren't any really good places to put it down that whole strip of lakes, so I'm torn.  But, that freight link thing has just been getting bigger and more insane for minimal benefit.  Current plans start at the south side of the Stirling bridge. which would mean that short of some huge cloverleaf interchange and a bridge upgrade at Canning Hwy the gains are going to be minimal in terms of flow (some earlier plans did include this, drawing a line right the way from the container terminal and down Tydeman Rd. in some fantasy of an almost exclusive truck funnel).  But the toll; natch.  It makes all the silliness worthwhile.  It's funny, some of the forecasts of the number of trucks you can down this road were so high and theoretical (presumably to sell the toll profits idea, I guess).

perth,362mpu,chase02,0,Fri May 15 21:35:14 2015 UTC,The land was cleared decades and decades ago...
perth,362mpu,hydroplaen,6,Sat May 16 03:00:47 2015 UTC,I've got mates in their 40s who helped clear Kellerberin when they were young. It wasn't that long ago.
perth,362mpu,hydroplaen,5,Sun May 17 04:27:43 2015 UTC,huh where did you think food comes from? what do you propose as an alternative?
perth,362mpu,tatty000,2,Sat May 16 03:18:50 2015 UTC,"Although I by no means have the answer there are more sustainable alternatives out there or currently being developed. I believe some counties are using high-rise farms. Also, Veganism is a rather unpopular alternative. Although you still need farms to grow food, it's a lot, lot less resource intensive than raising and feeding cattle, etc. I've also heard of practices that involve rehabilitating land while also allowing the land to be used for farming.  Edit - I should note that I'm not talking specifically about the Wheatbelt here, I got a bit off topic. Just that these are things that might help us farm more sustainably in the future."
perth,362mpu,hydroplaen,3,Sat May 16 03:22:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't think it's right to make those kinds of suggestions...  High-rise farms provide SFA in food. The wheatbelt is part of dryland cropping, and is pretty much the only area in the whole of WA to actually have any form of grains cropping. It's much more grains and legumes than anything else. So vegan/vegetarian doesn't solve the issue.  Land rehabilitation basically says no to agri and yes to native vegetation. That's great, but food still needs to come from somewhere. The best option is a combination of improved native vegetation communities, and mixed cropping including the consideration of forestry.  WA's food requirements isn't much and we manage sustainably, but we export a lot. This is a significant portion of our existence here, and so it's important to maintain global food demands.  I am a former agri dpmnt staff and study enviro science. I can happily point to more resources and other info if you'd like."
perth,362mpu,hydroplaen,2,Sat May 16 03:47:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, that's interesting. Like I said I really don't know any of the answers, I just wanted to point out that we don't have to continue doing things the way we always have when there are people out there coming up with more sustainable options. High rise farms and cutting back on meat consumption are two things that can potentially be great for the environment, even if they are not the answer for the Wheatbelt. I'd love to see more farmers taking a shared land use approach as you suggest. I've heard some great talks from farmers doing just that - finding native species that their animals won't destroy or that will actually benefit their crops.  Nice to see fellow enviro science students on here. I work in conservation so my knowledge is mainly focused on managing remnant bushland rather that agriculture. It's something I'd love to delve into more."
perth,362mpu,250xy500,1 point,Sun May 17 08:21:23 2015 UTC,"The early farmers were using wooden carts to clear the land around WA, they didn't have the means or the technology to build high rise farms. They also weren't as aware of the effects of clearing so much land as we are now. Take a trip out to a farming town like Dumbleyung and check out the history of the place, it's pretty interesting and amazing to find out how they did it all."
perth,362mpu,postingstuff,1 point,Sun May 17 08:44:14 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm not claiming they should have been able to build high rise farms back then, I'm just pointing out that in the future we may not need these big open spaces to produce food. Although it's impossible to recreate what was originally on the land we should be looking at using these alternatives so we can start rehabilitating the land and putting something back there that will benefit the environment. I know it's not as simple as I make it sound, but it's something that needs to happen.  Edit - haven't been to that town but I grew up in the Wheatbelt and find the history super interesting! I would always like to learn more, though."

All the land is locked up as farms, and bush reserves are few and far between, and rarely larger than 300 acres. Some farms have salinity so bad and are so on the fringe of rainfall areas that the government should buy the land back instead of continually bailing them out of the bad years.

I went out and got a job as a storeman, got my license and got offered my apprenticeship after my first interview.

Eg: Aussie airlines outsourcing plane repairs and maintenance to asian countries. relevant unions had a strike saying that was a bad idea. Their grand idea to convince the airlines to keep the jobs in Australia was to have a STRIKE! Great guys! OR the company can send the work over seas where the labour is 500x cheaper, get potentially the same end product and avoid having selfish workers strike for no good reason.

We have relied on mining for the last 150 years to keep us going and there have been plenty of ups and downs. I think most people would agree that we need to diversify more and try to encourage new industries here. A state built just on mining isn't a strong one. Lack of new spending on public transport. Despite the fact that the last election had a major focus on investment in public transport, the only major project mentioned is the Forrestfield/Airport rail link. Absolutely no talk of the MAX light rail, not even a token sentence, so I think it is clear that won't be happening any time soon. Instead the government seems more than happy to divert funding to new roads with help from the feds. Asset sales and the deficit. Don't see how the budget is going to be balanced any time soon. Asset sales don't do anything really. They can pay off debt in the short term, but in the long term WA has just lost another revenue source. Public sector cuts might do something but it won't fix the deficit and it will have a flow on effect on the performance of government services. Really it just looks like Barnett is crossing his fingers that the iron ore skyrockets in the next few years - which I am pretty sure won't happen.   Labor are going to love this and I can't blame them. Barnett doesn't have a plan for the future and I'm starting to feel that he squandered the mining boom"

So I can be drink driving, but you are the negligent party in the accident, I can still claim.  I have zero idea how this will evolve when it becomes faultless. Faultless claims means that anyone injured in an accident, either minor, major or death, will have an avenue to claim.

I would check with your strata company first.   As for the painting anyone can splash on some paint- to do a really good looking job requires some skills."
perth,35xhak,tw33kz0r,1 point,Thu May 14 10:56:28 2015 UTC,Yeah in the bylaws it states that I need to get their permission. So I am currently drafting a letter and hoping they will say yes.

perth,35xhak,Brewjo,3,Thu May 14 15:32:36 2015 UTC,"Carpets: Hire a carpet cleaner from the shops, give them a going over per instructions. Then cut them up into manageable rolls while still damp, saves a ton of dust kicking up. Salvage your skirting boards if you have them, at the least they will give you the right measurements for replacements. About $100 to DIY and 1 days work if you can rope in a buddy to help.  Painting: Do this before the flooring, watch a few tutorials on youtube. Brush-up on plastering too, bound to be a couple of spots that need some TLC. $600 in paint and tools. A day to prep the walls/ceiling/plaster etc. 1 day to do ceilings with a buddy (it just sucks going solo on ceilings).  Then about a room a day depending on how many undercoats you need.  Timber floors: So you have the timber and underlay already?  Cool, phone up and get three on-site quotes for install only. After that you can sort through any new info they give you and choose the best bang for your buck."
perth,35xhak,Kosmo777,2,Thu May 14 11:09:29 2015 UTC,Carpet removal is easy. I'd do this yourself. Getting the smooth edge off is a pain but a hammer should do the trick.   I would recommend getting an installer who is experienced in laying the floors. A handyman may not do it regularly so will either be slower and / or not do as good a job.   Painting is something you should do yourself. Buy a good quality brush for cutting in and make sure you use a sealer if the walls are bare plaster. I'd stay away from low sheen paint as patching can be noticeable. Stick with a washable matt paint.

With regards to painting I am so busy with work on weekends too that I may not be able to do it myself. I will ask some work folks if they know anyone already.   Thanks for your reply!!"
perth,35xhak,Buddhamama42,1 point,Thu May 14 11:50:39 2015 UTC,"Stick with a washable matt paint.    There really is no such thing, despite what manufacturer's claim.  Sheen level and washability are proportionally related - the lower the sheen level, the less washable it is."
perth,35xhak,Dhalphir,2,Mon May 18 04:40:15 2015 UTC,"My hubby was a painter. There's as much work in prep as there is in painting. If your walls are smooth and ready to go, its relatively simply to tape out the windows, cut in around the edges and then attack everything with a paint roller.  If your walls aren't nice and smooth and ready to go, be ready to spend a lot of time inside your local Bunnings and getting spackle out of your hair :(  Another hot tip : walls need at least two coats, probably three to look really really good (or maybe as Mr Buddhamama42 was a painter I'm mean and make him do three - but I think it makes a difference, anyway)  Oh and cheap paint is a false economy. Its well worth getting the wipe clean stuff with a low VOC - that way its easy to keep clean and the fumes won't poison you.  Also, get a tester pot - not just the paint chips they hand out. Put the paint onto three or four big sheets of cardboard and prop them up around the place so you can see how different colours work with different lights.  We had to choose our timber floors carefully to go with our grey/blue/greeny walls (Dulux Gentle Calm half) because the wrong colours looked really cold. So if you have your floors picked out, ask for a sample and take it with you to pick paint colours.  On the whole, go for warm based colours rather than cool based ones. Be aware that the colours can be cut with white - so if you like a colour, but its a bit strong, you can have it cut with white to calm it down a bit."

You can dry them in the sun or use a food dehydrator. A mortar and pestle or a coffee/spice grinder will allow you to make powder.   I recommend habaneros since they have so much flavour.   Don't do what I did and cut up habaneros without gloves :(

I know this truly isn't me normally, but I'm finding it harder and harder to hold back these urges.   CSC, being a Fortune 500 US company, has a relatively small presence in Australia.  Like any I/T company, outsourcing is the only way to do business, because their competition, IBM, HP, Fujitsu etc etc also outsource.  Customers have the choice to request local staff at a higher price, but amazingly, they see the price of local vs offshored staff and become suddenly interested in the benefits of offshoring.   I guess it's a case of hating the game and not the player... offshoring is the new, only way to do business.

Indian will cost 33% of onshore and output 1/10th at sub-standard quality.  Companies buy price but receive value and Indian staff are low value, low price.  Onshore are high value, high price.  It is false economy.  Many US companies have worked this out and are reversing the offshoring strategies.

That would be awesome if 100% of I/T was software development.   Sadly Perth isn't internationally famous for software development, and I'm fairly sure software development accounts for a tiny fraction of the I/T work that needs to happen in Perth.  Like I said, most outsourcers provide the option for local staff and offshore staff, and most companies, and I'm talking fortune 500 companies, accept the poorer quality in exchange for lower cost.  You should probably ring up Fortune magazine and tell them that all the execs from all those companies they rate are bad managers and they don't deserve the billions of dollars they make every year because outsourcing their I/T doesn't work."

perth,35oefd,dingo7055,9,Tue May 12 23:28:20 2015 UTC,"I'm always amused by Australians who don't speak anything other than English being ""offended"" by people speaking foreign languages thinking it's ""Rude"" because they might be talking about you.   Newsflash : It's not. In most parts of the world, where people are multilingual, it's normal.  And I always laugh at the massive ego required to assume that if someone is speaking in a foreign language, they must be speaking about you.  How do you think the locals feel when you're in Bali, or Bangkok, or Jakarta, and you don't bother to learn any of the local language and just blab on in English around them? Get the fuck over yourselves.   But nonetheless, I have a potential solution for you. I work in Australia, in a primarily English speaking environment. But for various reasons a number of contractors of ours in a certain area happen to be sourced from recent or past migrants from South Asia, particularly Pakistan. Naturally they feel most comfortable when at work talking to eachother in Urdu - the prominent dialect in huge parts of Pakistan.   Whilst I'd already gone out of my way to include these guys and have conversations with them asking about their culture, I decided to take it another step one day, and asked if they wouldn't mind teaching me the odd bit of Urdu.   Six months later, whilst I'm not a native speaker or even by any means advanced, I can hold a basic cordial conversation in Urdu.   As for the stench? It's a cultural difference. You either address it with them directly and point out that it's not considered polite in Australia to outwardly express body odour (because over there it's practically a badge of honour). And the reheated curries? Ask to try it sometime. You might be surprised to find that the most pongy curry smelling stench often actually turns out to be the most delicious thing you've eaten in a long time (with the exception of Fish curries - that shit is just foul)...   The only way you can overcome your prejudices is to completely submerge yourself in the deep end. If you're worried about being racist, that's the only way you'll truly overcome it (other than stupid cosmetic things that merely make their customs ""tolerable""), because that way you will actually come to understand how and why they do things the way they do. You might still disagree with them, but you will understand them, which is 85% of the battle. ""Walk a mile in another man's shoes"", so to speak."

Trying to be polite and not shame them I decided not to speak in Japanese and to mind my own business. Until they mentioned me and called me ""hairy and fat"" and how they ""hated clients like that"" and ""wished they could charge by weight like fruit"".  I instantly asked in perfect Japanese if they would mind being a little bit quieter as I was trying to sleep then threw in a barb about ""if they get to charge by weight like fruit"" can I depreciate value based on ""how many previous owners"" like a used car.

Nowadays that doesn't happen as much since most people have wised up to the fact that a lot of expats can speak Asian languages fluently.   Since I spent most of my childhood in Asia, culturally, I identify more strongly with my Asian heritage. When tourists visit Asia I have no problem with them not learning the language, since they are not residents (it is appreciated if they do pick up basic phrases but as someone who has studied other Asian languages, I understand how difficult they are). However I don't think it's outrageous to expect people to speak the language of the country that they are living and working in."
perth,35oefd,dingo7055,2,Thu May 14 15:10:20 2015 UTC,"Ok you got me all wrong. I'm not saying that immigrants to here shouldn't learn English. They ABSOLUTELY should. But by the same token, when they meet someone with a shared cultural heritage, we should be mature enough as a multicultural society to allow them to use their ancestral tongue to communicate with someone else who shares that language.   As for me I'm 100% Whitey/Northeast European, but I grew up in Asia, so I speak an Asian language fluently. If I meet someone from that Asian country - or who came from there, I naturally address them in that language too. Not because I don't want others to understand, but because knowing a foreign language, there's just that much more ""nuance"" and ""subtext"" that you have access to, that you might not necessarily with someone whose first language is not English... There are phrases in the Asian language I know that denote emotions and feelings that are completely alien to Westerners - so it's natural that I use the native tongue to express them.   If you really want, I'll give examples."
perth,35oefd,dingo7055,1 point,Tue May 12 13:01:36 2015 UTC,I'd love some examples
perth,35oefd,tinnedspicedham,5,Tue May 12 13:44:34 2015 UTC,"Sure.   So in Asia in general, the concept of ""Face"" is very important. It's analagous to ""honour"" in English speaking societies, but not really the same. It's kind of like a mix of pride and reverence/respect, and to ""lose face"" (in Thai they say ""Hai Naa"" ""หายหน้า"" - literally ""Losing face/nerve/courage"") is deeply shameful and immediately puts someone at a disadvantage in a social situation.   As an example of where one might lose face - if they raise their voice and start shouting during conflict resolution. Westerners are often surprised to see Asians smile back at them when they start shouting at them in an argument. They're not smiling because they think it's funny, they're smiling because they're embarrassed, and they are looking at you with pity because you've just lost the argument.   The example I was going to give is sort of related to this concept, in a weird kind of way. In Thai culture there's an emotion/feeling called ""Graeng Jai""/""เกรงใจ"" (words to denote emotion in Thai are always suffixed with ""Jai"" - which relates to matters of the heart).  In a nutshell in Thailand (though Westernisation has eased this in recent years)if someone gives you a present - say a birthday or christmas present, it's generally considered kind of impolite if you open it right there in front of them, especially in group situations. The presents are to be opened in private, so just in case it might embarrass you in front of others, or worse, embarrass the gift giver. Graeng Jai is basically the feeling of being unable to ""return the favour"" if somebody gives you an outrageously expensive gift. So for example if someone who makes way more money than you gives you a gift of a new car, it's considered deeply insulting to your honour, because you will not only never be able to return the favour, but you will feel beholden to the gift giver.  Graeng Jai is one main reason for the custom of not opening presents in public - also because it might hurt others' feelings if they see that you've given someone a gift that is far better than one you might have given them in the past.   I promise you my explanation is only doing 80% justice to the emotion, it's just something that is more simply understood in Thai.   How does this justify people being able to speak their own mother tongue, even in an English speaking country? The examples I gave were to indicate how often in different languages, there's a whole different social context structured into the very language itself, so it's naturally more confident for people to speak in this tongue.   Can you imagine trying to explain to someone who is just learning English the concept of ""A fair go""? Arguably simpler than what I just explained, but really, not as simple as it sounds because there's subtleties involved in the concept itself, and it's not a black and white thing. I had a tremendously difficult time a few weeks ago trying to explain to my Urdu speaking friends just what the concept of ""The ANZAC Spirit"" was. After five minutes : ""Ah, so it is with reference to those who died in war in 1915?"". Me : ""Well. No. Yes. I mean. Yes and no, but... No.. """

I'm 10+km off the end of RWY06 on a bit of a hill, and on a still night I can hear the rumbling of a departing flight for a minute or so as they accelerate down the runway and climb away. Landings sound a bit different because the engine power setting is very low, vs takeoff where it's very high.  Specifically, you might've heard CX170 which was an A330-300 departing Perth from RWY03 (facing almost directly away from Cannington) at 0051 (about an hour late), bound for Hong Kong. A few minutes prior to that was a smaller Jetstar A320, also running late, heading to Sydney.

perth,35oxl6,metao,1 point,Thu May 14 02:06:36 2015 UTC,"Strength will help in any combat situation but krav maga will teach you useful skills that don't require massive amounts of strength. For example, there's a technique for getting out of being choked that requires very little strength and you don't need to be an awesome fighter to take someone down with a groin strike or some eye gouging. You even learn things like how to use a chair as a shield and as a weapon at the same time or the instructor might go to the car park and setup a road rage scenario. You'll be taught to be aware of your surroundings so if you're outnumbered and can't attack then you'll learn how not to be surrounded and cornered.   There are many Youtube videos online on krav maga that you could watch. I can understand that you might feel a bit intimidated about going down and being a beginner but we all started in the same position and I know the guy who runs the aforementioned club is a nice guy. It's good for fitness too so it's a good way to keep off the calories and if you have a partner then it's something both of you can do together.  What have you got to lose?"

Perth's system works much better than others. London, Paris, US, Canada etc.   The best comparison has been Toulouse, France. Their public transport card is a once a month payment for unlimited PT use across buses and trains, for a small fee you can get unlimited use to bike share on the same card, and it has your student details so you can get discounts at food outlets. It was basically a multi-function transport card."

Cuts to said manager exits the building with a sweaty face, and is confronted by the former staff.   Cue funny line : They say ""Hey Mike, whatchya doing?""  Mike : ""Uhh,taking off..""  Employee : ""Taking off with what?""  Mike : nervous chuckle, sweat pouring down face ""Uhh, my car"" (in the background an employee can be heard saying ""With all the servers and stuff?""  Manager drives off in his rented Prius.   Cut to acting studio manager talking to a security guard who's turned up about the situation, and about how much money the company owes current and former employees and the ATO.   Cut to employees inside the building apparently talking to manager through a door he's barricaded himself in (the server room). They are talking about how what he's doing is illegal and he's not supposed to be there.   Some time later he emerges, sweat pouring down his face, and says they're trespassing and he requests they leave or he'll call the Police. They kind of laugh and say that they've already called the Police.   Cut to - the Police arriving and approaching the employees. Cop's first order of business is politely asking not to be filmed, although (gg cop) reiterates the cameraman has every right to film him, he just prefers if he was not on camera.   Cut to following day, shot of a note on the door from the company President (Marty L. Brickey - currently in 2015 facing 120 years in US Federal Prison on 30 charges of money laundering and wire fraud) basically telling employees to fuck off and if they enter the building they'll be charged with trespass.   Cut to employees the following day leaving the building after Police have asked them to move on, discussing how other tenants in the building don't believe the order is legal.  Butch female cop enters stage right, approaches the cameraman and asks him to turn it off, he says ""Do I have to?"" and she says ""Yep, or else I'll seize it"" (this is completely illegal). Cameraman complies, obviously not wanting to cause trouble.   Final minutes surreal fps footage from two employees returning in the dead of night, evidently as the Manager is inside removing IP from servers, knocking on the door and bizarrely requesting return of private property such as headphones etc., Manager cordially negotiates through a glass door for them to come back and pick up their property the next day - when he's already left the country obviously.   Full disclosure : I was there, and I was the man behind the camera. Feel free to AMA."
perth,35lbow,Lou_do,1 point,Tue May 12 09:21:45 2015 UTC,did anything come of the trespass and did you end up getting paid?
perth,35lbow,Lou_do,2,Tue May 12 11:20:19 2015 UTC,"Well first of all, we weren't strictly speaking trespassing. Reason being we had never been sacked in the first place. The whole thing happened so fast - the first night this footage was taken was literally 2 hours after the Studio Manager (who was American) was basically asked to take part in removing the IP from the office and rendering all assistance necessary. I think they were probably a bit shocked to realise that though he was American, he was one of the good ones, and he was on our side. He politely told them to get fucked, handed his keys and swipe cards in and left immediately. So this action was prompted pretty much by us learning about it within hours and being pissed off enough to haul our asses right down there at 8pm on a Friday night - because we knew that they would come back and try to get it done at night. So yeah, technically if you haven't been fired, you haven't lost your rights to be on the premises. We did have some minimal legal advice at the time and we figured we had the law on our side, mostly because to do what the US Manager in the video was doing was highly illegal under Australian law - the business was technically insolvent, and the company hadn't filed for voluntary administration. None of the required procedures to actually terminate employees had been undertaken, among so many other things. Imagine a folio turning up on the desk of Fair Work Australia, and them reading it and just rolling their eyes and going ""What the hell do we do with this?""..   Anyway, that's why we were so confident in the ""trespass"". In later scenes in the video we were outside the building, which was in Technology Park - which is Public land, so despite what the Company and even the building manager (who is not in this video) said, we were within our rights to peacefully protest outside and in the carpark (probably why we never got arrested, although not all the Police were that cordial with us - the woman asking me to turn the camera off was a right bitch until she talked to us for about ten minutes and realised we were all just a bunch of geeks who wanted our rightfully owed pay and super - and to finish the game)....  But no, we did not end up getting paid. Over the course of the weekend we basically had a ""Sit-In"" outside the office, where we watched the US manager, as well as contractors from another Australian firm (who were in violation of Federal workplace law which forbids an Australian company to knowingly trade with another company that is in breach of workplace law / insolvent) went in and out of the building to rape the servers.   The final straw, my lawyer basically told me we could get an injunction to stop them from removing the IP with a court order, but we had a window of about 8 hours to make it happen, and it would cost us around 20 - 45 thousand AU$ to make it happen.   Well, none of us had been paid in months of course, so that never happened.   So this news about Marty?   Very sweet. That's an understatement. Won't get my thousands back, but damn it feels nice to see that fucking cunt get his just dessert.

The computers have full IT support from supplier and are updated when necessary.  There's a lot of school management programs that are on Mac computers that aren't available for Windows and don;t have an equivalent. eg. Seqta/Coneqt  It's not as bad a deal as it looks up front considering the Macbook Air that I know some schools are using are $1,200-$1,400 retail up front. Imagine if some kid had their own personal laptop stolen and their family couldn;t afford to replace it, so the kid couldn't participate in classes."

Still, $3-400 / year / student is a decent fee for a lot of people, especially considering that most schools have computer labs, most families have at least one computer at home (you can buy an entry-level Acer or HP laptop outright for $350 - the same as or cheaper than a year's rental on a macbook that the school arbitrarily decided is now mandatory).  That, and at the end of it, you've got a $1,600 paperweight that you have to give back, since a six year old computer is worth nothing - they depreciate worse than cars.  In addition, that isn't ""the government giving kids laptops"", that's the parents paying for a laptop under a rental agreement with the school or another third party.  Also, I'm pretty sure that my neighbour's kids had to get theirs paid for outright before they were enrolled as a compulsory requirement, and I swear he said it was $1,600 each."

Also, from a practical standpoint, I doubt the school would want the things stashed there anyway - every high school I went to had constant problems with lockers being broken into.  I'm also not sure if their insurance would cover it, as a computer (even though it's what the school denotes as mandatory) paid for by the parents would likely be considered personal property."

We're just in the age of drama I guess. (a bigger blind spot seems to be all the stuff that went on during the Howard years that we only find out about years later sometimes, but anyway..).  I wasn't crazy about some of these plans either.  Laptops for instance is one of those things where if you take too long and get it wrong people are saddled with outdated junk that would have been better spent on something else.  And yes, smaller parties don't provide a lot of great options some times.  Greens underestimate just how much business revolt there would be to them in government (whether its deserved or not is another thing).  Palmer planned to conjure money from thin air because ""He's made a billion dollars so he knows how. So just stop asking""  Aus politics it great."

Howard had a lot to contend with over three terms - picking up from Keating's ""recession we had to have"", the sudden influx of asylum seekers, 9/11 and the Coalition of the Willing and all that.  His government did some fucked up things (children overboard and the Tampa scandal), some good things (booting state sales taxes and bringing in uniform GST, which was sorely needed and long overdue), and some necessary evils (indigenous intervention).  That said, at the end of three consecutive terms, people were sick of him.  Rudd and the ALP didn't win against Howard and the Coalition because he was a popular leader and they were a popular party, they won that election because they weren't Howard and Coalition (the previous candidate they had was Mark Latham, who was a complete disaster).  Frankly, a lot of this stuff is more cyclical than anyone cares to admit.  What got me with Labour was all the infighting - that whole saga of Rudd vs. Gillard was pathetic, especially that bullshit of whether he was going to run or not in the leadership spills, and whether he was going to be Foreign Minister or not.  I think a lot of what they proposed had some merit, but between all the infighting at the top, and incompetence at the fore (e.g. Peter Garret), a lot of it either didn't get through, or was completely bungled in execution.  In the end (and correct me if I'm wrong), when Rudd re-knifed Gillard right before the election, the ALP's approval ratings were polling at something like 34%, and people's (and the Party's) confidence in Rudd's as leader was even lower.  Frankly (and here's the cyclical thing again), Tony Abbott and the Liberals didn't win that election because of some groundbreaking policies and a charismatic leader, they won it because they weren't Kevin Rudd and the ALP."

perth,35ju5d,nahcoob,5,Mon May 11 01:57:45 2015 UTC,"Without knowing more, I'm extremely skeptical.  'Number of houses connected' is almost certainly a near useless indicator of the plan's progress.  For example, it might take many months to construct the massive fibre infrastructures on which the network will ultimately rely.    Number of houses connected at xx months? 0-100. Number of houses connected at xx+6 months? 10,000+   The point is that actually connecting houses would only be facilitated by every other step being fully completed for that region. The project isn't a linear graph with a ticker somewhere adding 'one house per day'.   Another example is that it takes time to negotiate tenders for the contracts. This was a colossal project, and the govt has a responsibility to at least try and be reasonable about what money goes where. We can be cynical about this, but the reality is that more efficient spending takes time and care. So, it might take 12 months to negotiate the significant deals, while actual construction may take less time.   These figures aren't supposed to be accurate: it's just an illustration that it is quite meaningless for Libs to point at nothing other than 'houses connected.'   The only information with any potential value here is the reference to regions without any contracts being in place to start construction - and even that remark has no specifics which might be of use."
perth,35ju5d,clownyfish,4,Mon May 11 06:04:09 2015 UTC,"I must admit, I'm in a similar boat to previous commenter. I did not vote Labour or LNP, but LNP winning was a disaster in my eyes. Having said that, I lived in a suburb where the NBN fibre rollout ""commenced"" before the election, and I have to say whilst I was excited at the time to see the odd van with an NBN logo on the side of it (that kind of ""slap on"" magnetic sign), I was bemused by how low-key and seemingly disorganised it looked. You'd sort of see two or three plods with a hardhat standing over a hole in the ground next to a ""don't fall in the hole pole"", kind of scratching their bums and seeming to wonder what to do.   Then the election happened, and all activity died down for months. I was pretty depressed about prospects that I'd get fibre. Then suddenly one day, every single day and especially weekend it'd be a HIVE of activity. Suddenly up to 10 vans, trucks and ""ditch witch"" machines would rock up on a street corner, 10 or so guys looking like they were knowing exactly what they were doing with a foreman with an iPad running around, and you could actually SEE them digging the trenches or feeding the fibre into the ground.  As of just a month or so ago, I've seen smaller teams hooking up the NBN Boxes to the side of peoples' houses, and when I approached the foreman/supervisor to ask about when I might expect the same, and what to expect, he was absolutely professional and polite with answers forthcoming, and even gave me his business card and a card with the NBN Co's number to call if I had any questions.   Say what you will about LNP's dog's breakfast NBN, they obviously did something to whip the company into more efficient management and organisation.   But as we're seeing, that's kind of been their downfall - what with the Strategic Review documents being submitted to the Senate with whole sections redacted, sections which probably show that they've whipped NBN co into so much shape that it probably CAN deliver Fibre to the premise at the original price, or even cheaper.

NBN isn't moving along as fast as any of us would have hoped and at the same time, because it is an ""eventuality"" you have areas with houses but without ports for ADSL and in some cases not even having lines laid down. You can argue though that most people use their mobile as their primary phone number instead of landlines and that has contributed to this too.  And while it's also difficult to speculate on exactly what would have happened I like to think by now ISPs would have noted that there is an exponential increase in demand for bandwidth and begun installing their own hardware and lines. Heck it could have even started a turf war whereby ISPs would be racing to claim new and old housing estates in order to claim a customer base and or be able to wholesale to other ISPs. Competition just seems like the fastest way for a larger number of consumers to be able to gain access to fiber and I'm sure iiNet wouldn't have let Optus and Telstra take their home turf.

In a purely circumstantial case (no direct evidence, such as a smoking gun witness) you have to put forward your scenario of events and then use what evidence is available to prove that scenario actually took place, and do so beyond reasonable doubt.

Telstra pfaffed around for a week or two. Phoned me for some disruptive testing. No worries. One Telstra bloke over the phone said there was some 'foriegn current' on the line and will get back to me. A week or so went by and another tech contacted me about coming out to my place.  He said he had tested the various junctions between me and the exchange (I am about just under 3Ks of cable length away) and eliminated it to the last hop from the pit nearest to me.  He said he'd swap pairs on this last hop and this should do it.   Turns out it didn't do it.  Turns out in the end the fault was one of my extensions in my house. Previous owner had obviously had it done bodigly and there was likely water or corrosion within the pairs to the wall socket causing the issues. Once this extension was disconnected from my central filter in my eaves - things were back to as perfect as I would expect with my distance from the exchange.  Not that this couldn't have been picked up with or without a phone hanging of this device. Seems there was shorting on the pairs in my wall.  TL;DR  Dodgy house internal wiring was causing issues with line quality and connections even with filter and all other devices eliminated.

perth,35k4j1,Gruggleberries,3,Mon May 11 04:47:01 2015 UTC,"I did my own in 2011. Just a simple RFID glass ampoule in the hand. You can get implant tubes quite cheap online from piercing shops and the process doesn't take too long. If you are not comfortable with basic medical procedures or are worried about infection,  professional piercers can do it for you if you shop around. I tried to get a doctor to do it first - but none were willing to even consider it.   Downsides are the difficulty of acquiring compatible tech for the home (most providers of RFID tech target hotels with large orders), and difficulty with donating blood at the Red Cross afterwards. I received a precautionary 2 year ban, but the nurses nearly put me on the life ban list though (something about medical procedures performed outside of a professional environment).   Upsides include convenience with playing around with hobbiest-level tech with some of the bits always on-hand. Also, when you don't want attention drawn to it, a small bumb on the hand is pretty discreet."
perth,35k4j1,stingyasfuck,3,Mon May 11 17:17:11 2015 UTC,"Just in case you have trouble with piercing places, doctors who implant the contraceptive Implanon may also do the RFID chip. I know someone who got a chip inserted at Woodvale Park Medical Centre (by Dr Brett Watson I believe)."

Section 2 along Stock Rd, Leach Hwy and High St in still in the planning stage, yet they have already shortlisted 3 consortiums to build it. There really is no transparency here - basically no documents on this are publically available. I can't find an environmental impact assessment or a cost benefit analysis anywhere. How can you effectively decide what is the best solution and who is best to construct it when the contracts about to be signed?

They shortlist consortiums to get the most competitive design. Even though 3 are listed, it's actually Leighton on both and the other 2 going for 1 each.

I know I unsub subreddits pretty quickly if either they're stale or not interesting to me any more. Especially if the listing is a little older, and likely has been sold elsewhere and not updated here.  I think from an buyer vs. seller perspective its more a dead end.

perth,35cnaa,kolhar,8,Sat May 9 00:53:16 2015 UTC,"The four big projects to be funded over four years are paths along the Mitchell Freeway extension from Burns Beach Road to Hester Avenue, Great Eastern Highway between Bilgoman Road and Mundaring, the Reid Highway dual carriageway and Gateway WA.   Three of these aren't really new announcement and have already got contractors on the ground working. They are also major road projects that have some bike path attached, not bike path projects."
perth,35cnaa,aussiekinga,9,Sat May 9 01:05:42 2015 UTC,"Two of them, the Mitchell Fwy extension and Gateway WA, they are legally required to provide bike paths anyway - it isn't like they are going out of their way to be generous.   The bike paths next to the Reid and Great Eastern Hwy are nice, but they really aren't priorities. The only people who cycle around Mundaring at the moment are middle aged men in lycra on weekends - at the chances are they are just going to keep using the road (can't blame them, they are going to have to watch out for cars leaving driveways every 100m).   The problem is that the government is building these paths next to major highways because it is easy/cheap, not because that is where people want to cycle. If you look at ""bike cities"" around the world, most people don't cycle more than 5-10km over flat ground - this is what Perth should be aiming for."
perth,35cnaa,theenglishguy72,1 point,Sat May 9 03:20:18 2015 UTC,Well said. I came to the same conclusion. I like to ride my bike as transport instead of driving occasionally but I don't find myself heading south thinking hmm there needs to more path or I wish I could get to the hills on nicer cycleway.....
perth,35cnaa,thegreataussiebbq,1 point,Sun May 10 01:30:36 2015 UTC,"on the other hand, I do know lots of people who do long rides all the time and who do ride up to the hills on a very regular basis and would love to get onto their own path rather than be on the same road as large trucks. Just because you don't do it doesnt mean there isnt demand from riders for it."
perth,35cnaa,aussiekinga,2,Mon May 11 01:30:32 2015 UTC,"No of course not, but it's the needs of the masses vs the needs of the minority. I'm sure there are groups of people riding in all directions who would like their own path. I'd like a path that I can follow south on the mitchell freeway and continue to follow the graham farmer instead of just ending up in northbridge, but thats not being built. At the end of the day any improvement is still an improvement :)"
perth,35cnaa,thegreataussiebbq,3,Mon May 11 02:57:11 2015 UTC,"I guess it is a cost vs risk vs benefit thing. A path through Northbridge might benefit a lof of people* but the cost of getting the land to do it would be huge. Plus you are on lower speed roads. Then you look at places where they are putting it in - along highways and freeways - and it is about taking people off the 'riskier' high speed roads/areas. Plus land in those areas is easier as there is already a corridor set aside.  It is also a lot that is near the train line. I know PTA has been doing research and stuff into how to encourage people to ride to the train station. So a bike bath along hte train line meansd someone can go through their suburb, join the path and get to the closest station.  Basically its is ""bang for your buck"" they are looking at, I think.  *isnt the Mitchell path up til Leederville-ish and then there is one along Roe street Northbridge and then past Clasiebrook and onto GFF? So there is a small gap and its not exactly direct, but its not a huge amount of road riding in there."

perth,35cnaa,CyanideRemark,2,Sun May 10 00:53:07 2015 UTC,I think the police leave people on bike paths alone and only really enforce it for people on roads. Probably 15-20% of cyclists along Mounts Bay Road don't have a helmet on and I don't know anyone who has been fined
perth,35cnaa,theenglishguy72,1 point,Sat May 9 15:25:04 2015 UTC,Isn't Perth a bit too spread out for something like this? Cycling works well in Europe because the cities are more compact and usually a bit flatter than Perth's hilly streets.  Great in theory but I don't feel it's feasible and the lycra clad masses will still take over the road on the weekends.
perth,35cnaa,ToxethOGrady,6,Sat May 9 14:34:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think Perth is to spread out to commute by bike. Sure cycling won't ever replace trips from Mandurah to the city, but the vast majority of journeys are less than 5kms. The problem is that the big bike lane projects that have been announced are along side freeways - instead they should be along direct and busy employment/residential areas. The state government is treating bikes like cars, which is a very ignorant way to act (it is easy to drive to a fast freeway, it is just a pain if you are a cyclist though)."
perth,35cnaa,theenglishguy72,3,Sat May 9 15:33:47 2015 UTC,"You're contrasting the weekend warriors to everyday, utilitarian riders such as commuters or simple people running errands.  I think you need to distinguish between the 'cycling is the new golf' crowd who love dressing up and heading out like some street gang of peacocks and the more practical side of riding a bike.   And as far as Perth having hilly streets; haven't you heard the term ""coastal plain""? I think you're  trying to make Perths topography sound like San Francisco.  I for a number of years commuted 30-40km a day on very  simple single speed or fixed wheel bikes which, similar to a kids bike only have one gear.   I only felt the need to build up bikes with gearing again once I started riding up in the scarp."

perth,35czl9,His_Holiness,7,Sat May 9 03:48:44 2015 UTC,Save the railway security number in your phone 92209999 and call it when there's an issue. Have the railcar number (number above the driver cab doors) and your door number ready (starting from the front of the train how many doors back are you) and provide accurate descriptions of the offender/s and their behaviour. Also remember to inform them which direction you're traveling in.  Learn which stations are staffed at night and if there's drama on the train when the train stops alert the staff. Staff will generally meet most trains and can usually be found on the platform.  Understand that revenue officers cannot physically help you so don't start drama on the trains they're on. They are  only security officers and their role is to observe and report.   Otherwise call the Police there's a delay in the information getting back to railway base but it usually gets there eventually.  If you're at an end station don't get on the train first let everyone else board and then pick your spot.   Sit near the front of the train close to the driver as they will be able to hear what's going on directly behind them and call it through.   If you're waiting for a taxi or something wait on the platform under CCTV coverage and learn where the emergency intercom is for your station and wait near it or near the transit office.  Organise your commute so you're not waiting on the platform for ages. Get a smart rider so you don't have to hang about buying tickets.
perth,35czl9,totapta050,1 point,Sat May 9 08:05:59 2015 UTC,"+1 for the Smartrider as having one also stops you from having to display any cash at the station itself - whilst you might get ""rolled"" for a Smartrider, you are FAR more likely to be for the cash used to buy the ticket!"

Cue five minutes of abuse and him not allowing me to get up, he was pretending he had a knife/gun on him and saying he would hurt me. I was pretty pissed off so I wasn't as concerned as I maybe should have been but it was obvious he was bluffing and my stop was Cannington which always has guards at.  The thing I found really shitty though was no one came to my defense. This happened when I was about 20, getting the train home from work so would have been after 9pm and there were plenty of guys (or heck, even women...

It seems at least at some points the plan was to simply cut off regular traffic altogether.

There won't be any tunnels or flyovers there. Signal changes designed to 'ease freight flow' already obstruct regular traffic quite a bit"

perth,359lsn,YumMonTar,15,Fri May 8 06:47:38 2015 UTC,"Yes and No.   A private school can give you more options, but not necessarily translated in to more success.   Private schools consistently dominate WACE/ATAR resuts. It's not close. They push the shit out of their students to get them high rankings. A higher ATAR does give your kids more options, although ironically at a time when most have no idea what they want to do.   That said, there is no barrier to students getting high rankings in public schools. It can be done - I did it with a couple of external week long tuition courses during my year 11 and 12 years. You'll also find studies that suggest public school students do a bit better at university because they haven't been pushed all this way by their school.   One option that I think is overlooked is moving house into the catchment zone for consistently high performing public schools. Rossmoyne, Willetton, Churchlands, Applecross (to an extent). What is critical at public schooling is getting your kid into the high-level maths/science/english classes. When I went to Melville there was a test you could do before you went there that could place you in the top level classes. This was a shitload better than having to be gradually bumped over the course of a year or two up from the classes with the dero kids who didn't give a shit. Would recommend. Also I can't recommend those ATAR prep courses run by private tutoring companies highly enough. They only go for a week or two in years 11/12 and they seriously help you dominate. Anyway, getting side tracked. Housing is more expensive in these catchment zones but a question that needs to be asked is; is it more expensive than 5 years x2, or x3 of private school fees?  Pros/Cons of private schools IMO:  Pros:  -Will push your kid to a better ATAR (more uni options)  -Old boys club can help a lot later in life  -Much better sports programs (seriously so much better, Aquinas cricket and footy for example trounces anything a public school has by so far it isn't funny)  Cons:  -COST COST COST  -May not actually do better at life  -Your kid looks like a dweeb in their suit thing (may not actually be a con)  -Your kid may be playing Soggy Sao (again, some people like it I dunno)"

I was shy, couldn't articulate well, and was hoping that Guildford would let me learn without having to worry about any of the usual social bullshit. I was also gay. So, there's that.  I was outed by a trusted 'friend' to my entire school, and was targeted constantly. All male school; must enforce heterosexuality!  As the outcast, I made friends with older students who were actually intelligent, but eventually I was worn down by everything.   Don't mistake me, the teachers were excellent. But didn't have much to offer in the way of emotional support for a confused and awkward teenager with a learning disability.  I did my final year at Cyril Jackson Senior Campus after losing my academic scholarship at Guildford (it's hard to achieve academically when you want to kill yourself most days).  I made some of my best friends there, and was actually interested in learning again. Everyone at CJS WANTED to achieve something with their lives and didn't care about sexuality, how much money you had, or whether you were good at sports. They wanted to go somewhere in their lives, and didn't have any of the social clique shite. The teachers were excellent, and invited discourse and debate, and encouraged me.

But I went to Willetton, which is one of the top public schools in the state (along with Rossmoyne - really around that area there are a lot of good choices for public schools, I think Applecross and Melville are both ranked quite well).  One thing that I think public schools do better is that for students who aren't on a university pathway they are typically more supportive and offer more options. You never hear about the VET courses at private schools or their links to TAFE courses or anything like that. I think public schools are better that way. Some students just aren't academic but with the right support they can go on to be really successful, and I think some schools ignore this as an option.  Also, a good student is going to get a great ATAR no matter where you send them.   I think most employers look more at your degree and university than they look at your high school.  So to summarise: if you're in the area for a decent public school already, then it's not worth going to private school. If you're in the area for a dodgy public school, then weigh up real estate costs against private school costs, I guess?"

If they're impressionable, they may just be exposed to a higher class of bad influence at a private school vs. that a state school.  If your child is a little bit reserved and a bit of an outcast from the popular crowd; they maybe merely exposed to a higher class of bully at a private school than at a state school.  If a kid is sent to a different High School from the majority of their friends are going after Primary school, they maybe being removed  a healthy peer support base and putting them amongst a new group and potentially making them an outcast amongst new social & financial demographic.  But then again where one kid may go to pieces or off the rails with this sort of change; another may flourish.  I'd say there's bad influences and questionable cultures at Private schools just as there at States schools; but my feeling is Private schools are much more adept at keeping such things under the carpet and maintaining a civil veneer."

But it's possible someone more wayward could be driven into being good at learning stuff in the right environment.  Likewise a certain kind of firm hand could put someone off it forever.  It varies.  The thing is tertiary institutions have zero trust in any school curriculum (well, zero might be pushing it but it's low.)  They also more and more cater to people from all walks of life, ages, countries and educational backgrounds.  So there's no real follow on from school outside of some reading, writing and basic maths any more.  Most courses do not assume any prior education in their topics and start from the ground floor (or don't trust any prior education and go over it again anyway).  And for any learning curve that's too steep there is a bridging course.  So as far as higher education goes high school is rendered mostly irrelevant.

There was almost zero bullying there that I saw and if there was it was dealt with very quickly. They were also really accommodating with my mental health issues and ADD - I don't think I'd have ever gone to Uni if I hadn't gone there.

perth,359lsn,scifiguard,1 point,Mon May 11 03:58:43 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the school tbh. For the most part either should be fine but there are some really shit house public schools (Belmont, armadale, gilmore (kwinana), balga etc) where if you're in those areas and for some reason don't wish to leave you're better off sending your kids to a private school instead."
perth,359lsn,modlac21,1 point,Mon May 11 06:28:17 2015 UTC,"I think it kind of depends on the student and on the particular school in question.   I'm studying a particularly prestigious course at UWA which is relatively hard to get into, and most of my classmates went to private schools (probably ~75%). I also think that if students are especially bright and motivated they will succeed in getting into what they want to regardless of which school they went to.   Also, as I mentioned before, and other people mentioned in the thread, not all public schools are alike. To be blunt, in essence the good ones are Perth Modern (which is selective), Shenton, Churchlands and Rossmoyne. If you can't get your children into any of those (not in the catchment), perhaps consider private schooling.   Similarly, not all private schools are great for academic outcomes.   Also, I think it is worth noting that the correlation between private schools and high ATARs is largely due to the child's family environment, SES, etc. which are associated privately educated school children (families where parents went to uni have children more likely to want to go to uni and apply themselves more academically etc).   tl;dr private schools are not the be all and end all of a good education, but it does have some impact"
perth,359lsn,numnum4eva,-3,Fri May 8 07:33:29 2015 UTC,"As someone who just graduated from a private high school, I've found a lot of my friends that attended public schools weren't the ""desirables"". I know every school has it's good and bad students, but it seems that private schools seem to churn out more of the good students than public. And by good, I mean people that treat others with respect.  It gets secretly drilled into you at a private school to be respectful, having strict codes, people tend to learn how to follow rules, and ultimately seen as better people in society.   Now, I'm not trying to offend anyone in saying that public school isn't good, I know several people from public schools that are high achievers at university and respectful people. But these days, it seems a lot more people from public school cause a nuisance in public.  That's just my look at the situation these days, from what I've been told and seen, in the past the gap between public and private wasn't much. These days, it's massive. I found out I got my first part-time job over a kid because I had a private school education compared to his public school."

Even then it can be a little competitive. I put a big ol' fat arse Sony Trinitron 68cm (phhhwwwoar!)

I don't know where you'd find them unfortunately. I dump all mine at battery world, maybe you can pop in to one of them and ask if you can raid their donation bin?  I can offer some insight into the trouble you might run into trying to get old electronics to harvest motors from. I used to volunteer at a charity shop where people would donate clothes. We weren't allowed to accept any electronics because by law you had to have an electrician check it before you take it away. They would all get thrown in the bin. So you might find organisations unwilling to allow you to take any electronic waste because they are afraid to piss off the law.  That might be a good avenue of investigation though. Hit up your local vinnies/salvos/red cross shop and speak to the manager. Let him know what you're after and ask him not to throw it away. You might get lucky. I know most of them hate to see anything go to waste."

perth,35521w,crosstherubicon,1 point,Fri May 8 02:39:36 2015 UTC,"Not being found guilty for murder does not always mean the accused isn't guilty - sometimes it simply means there was not enough evidence to convict. The judge needs to believe beyond all doubt that the person being charged is guilty for a conviction to take place. If a judge finds themselves doubting and believe the evidence to be insufficient, then in the eye of the law a murderer can, in fact, get away with murder.   Not being guilty does not always equal innocence.  Edit: Just want to clarify that this comment isn't to say you're wrong (we'll probably never know the truth) but mainly for those arguing ""he wasn't found guilty by the jury so he's innocent"" because y'all are silly."
perth,35521w,metao,-2,Fri May 8 02:45:48 2015 UTC,"Actually, if you're found not guilty, then you are automatically innocent. You cannot be innocent and guilty of the same crime at the same time. The mere fact you are innocent, until proven guilty as per the justice system means that he is innoncent, given that he was proven not guilty.  I appreciate what you are saying - that there was not enough evidence to secure a guilty conviction on the charge of murder. However, he is by every definition of the word in the eyes of the law and society, innocent. To say otherwise is very, very silly.  Often it is stupid for the general public to make any comments on cases like these. None of us know the evidence as well as the judge, none of us were at the trial. It is stupid for people to say ""he did it"" because reasons."
perth,35521w,tw33kz0r,2,Thu May 7 15:32:42 2015 UTC,"If you commit a crime but are found not guilty by a court because there wasn't enough evidence to convict you, you're not innocent. Yes, in law and society you are not guilty. But you did commit the crime, therefore aren't innocent. 'Guilty' means that it has been proven beyond all reasonable doubt that you committed the crime you're being charged with, whereas 'not guilty' means it has not, but not always that you didn't commit it. Again, not guilty does not always equal innocence. The presumption of innocence exists, yes, but again does not mean the person is actually innocent - the court just presumes this until a verdict is met. You could be a judge knowing the defendant is not innocent but because the prosecution screwed up their case, find the person not guilty.  Also, you can be innocent and guilty at the same time. Not guilty doesn't mean innocent just as much as guilty does not mean not innocent. There's no 'innocent' ruling."
perth,35521w,metao,-1,Fri May 8 00:59:10 2015 UTC,"Innocent and guilty are mutually exclusive.  The fact that the court ruled there is not enough evidence to PROVE you are guilty, means that you are INNOCENT.  Innocent until proven guilty. As you said, this presumption exists, and for a reason.  In the eyes of society and the law, Lloyd Rayney is not guilty of murdering his wife. Therefore, as I mentioned, he is innocent (he did not kill her).  It is very much black or white, you are innocent, or guilty. Society doesn't care about opinions, it cares about verdicts. Unless there is an appeal, then Lloyd Rayney innocence is put to question again. There is no grey area, as you are describing - and if you think there, is then that is your own fault and misunderstanding."
perth,35521w,peppynonpep,5,Fri May 8 02:50:40 2015 UTC,The murder trial was pretty badly presented and the jury could reasonably have gone either way but I fail to see how he could be acquitted of phone bugging? This has to be a new low for the DPP and police. How much has this case cost?
perth,35521w,metao,12,Fri May 8 04:57:21 2015 UTC,"There was no jury in his murder trial. Being a smart lawyer, he gave up his right to a jury and had the judge decide. The judge, knowing his responsibility to decide the case based on the evidence presented, rather than his gut feel, found that the prosecution had failed in their burden to prove the case.  Edit: whereas a jury, like all juries, would be likely to follow their instincts, which in this case would find him guilty."
perth,35521w,peppynonpep,8,Thu May 7 05:39:56 2015 UTC,"you say ""juries would follow their instincts"" like it's a good thing."
perth,35521w,postingstuff,1 point,Thu May 7 08:40:54 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it is, though. Otherwise we wouldn't have juries, and we'd always just use the judge like Rayney did. But sometimes there is good reason to suspect the jury will be biased, and when that is going against the defense, it makes sense to go without. Pistorius also had no jury.  The flipside of that, obviously, is your OJ style thing, where jurors let famous people off because of good PR."
perth,35521w,dzernumbrd,1 point,Thu May 7 10:10:56 2015 UTC,"Juries do not ""follow their instincts"", they follow a set of instructions given to them by the judge that help lead them to conclude on a guilty or not guilty verdict. If they ignore a set of instructions and just go by their instincts, it would be deemed a mistrial.  Furthermore, he requested trial without jury because the case was so heavily prejudiced against him in the media - in no world would he be given a fair trial by a jury. This is very common in a lot of heavily publicized trials"
perth,35521w,Mr_Ron_Swanson,1 point,Thu May 7 11:57:54 2015 UTC,"I am aware of why he requested trial by jury. I basically said the same thing above.  If you think juries don't follow their instincts, you've clearly never served on a jury. Anecdotes are not data, but the last time I did jury duty, 10 people had made up their mind long before closing arguments. Only 2 of us made any attempt to actually critically examine the evidence.   Also, I'm fairly certain that a mistrial cannot be declared without evidence of wrongdoing. It's well within reason that a jury can make a ridiculous decision while still having the appearance of following all the instructions of the judge."

Suss out Covs or Repco for clutch prices, and ask them of mechanics around who do things on the cheap. Those guys usually know of the good mechanics who don't charge an arm and a leg.  Jump onto some facebook groups and see if anyone will do it for you if you're on a budget... Perth Beer Economy seems to have a few mechanics that are happy for a couple slabs.

perth,355ddp,tatty000,1 point,Thu May 7 07:06:04 2015 UTC,"Well you can get genuine (from Nissan), or after market (still new, but a different brand). Also, after market clutches can be from like $100 to $1000.  Well, for a clutch to go on a 7-8 year old car isn't uncommon, but maybe something isn't quite right... so then re-hashing is where the clutch has been wearing at the flywheel and causes it to wear in an odd way, so they 're-hash', or machine, the flywheel to kind of 'fix' it.  I'll ask around and see what's your way."

The down side is they're quite expensive genuines can be in the range of $1000 on their own. Non gen can be had for around $500 (both made by the same company but The warranties will vary)   You can put in a single mass flywheel which will be around $200 but will make it horrible to drive.

Also, Medieval Fayre is coming up (May 16) and I'm 99% sure there'll be a stall selling handcrafted leather goods there (presumably locally made).

perth,34tbvu,Dr_fish,4,Tue May 5 04:34:31 2015 UTC,"Insulation can affect heat exchange with the air, which works both ways, and it can lessen radiated heat absorption from the sun, which negatively impacts interior temperature in winter.  Also we tend to design houses with internal cooling in mind (roof cavities, high ceilings, air con vents positioned for cold air flow). So when you reverse the air con in winter, heat often pools at the ceilings and escapes, AND you're absorbing less heat from the environment.   So to rephrase, our houses tend to be designed to be hard to heat up."

perth,34teb3,crosstherubicon,15,Mon May 4 23:03:58 2015 UTC,"Having looked at the comments here I will be in the minority. Anyway...  When I'm driving I am usually paying attention to the road. That includes pedestrians on the side.  If someone looks like they're going to step out then I slow, change lanes, honk, whatever.  You shouldn't be whining. You should be thankful. Imagine you were driving a car. If that were the case you would have killed someone today. Maybe you need to look at the way you're riding. And maybe that's why the people around weren't very sympathetic. Remember that you're operating a vehicle.  If you weigh 80kg going at 30kmph then when you hit you're applying 666 newtons. While that wont kill anyone distributed evenly over their body, if they hit the road and strike their head you could easily kill them.  And remember that you had the opportunity to wear a helmet; they didn't.  While she wasn't in the right for not looking, you weren't in the right either. For someone to receive compensation for an accident the plaintiff needs to show that the driver was being negligent. Often both drivers can be held negligent and liable for compensation.

perth,34teb3,perthtemp69,7,Mon May 4 14:54:42 2015 UTC,"666 newtons? where did you get that figure from? The force applied depends on the rate at which the velocity changes (deceleration) which, is highly uncertain and approaches infinity as the time decreases."
perth,34teb3,crosstherubicon,-6,Tue May 5 01:16:57 2015 UTC,80kg at 30kph - exactly what I stated.  It isn't really uncertain. In fact - it is the law of the universe.  Newton discovered this a long time ago.  I don't think 80kg and 30kph are unreasonable estimates.
perth,34teb3,perthtemp69,5,Tue May 5 03:27:27 2015 UTC,"You're mixing momentum and force. The force that is necessary to stop an 80 kg object travelling at 30 km/hr depends on the rate at which its velocity drops to zero. F = m.a = m.(Vstart-Vend)/(delta T). You could also describe it as the time rate of change of momentum but the ""rate"" part is important. A small restoring force will slow a moving object much slower than a larger restoring force eg a brick wall."

perth,34teb3,perthtemp69,7,Tue May 5 05:11:26 2015 UTC,Now you've mixed acceleration and velocity. The link asks you for the deceleration.. not the change in velocity. Deceleration is the change in velocity DIVIDED BY THE TIME over which that change takes place. That's why there's a two in the exponent of the t value  When you're ready to apologise because you're now up to speed with the 17th century then let me know.. moron.

perth,34teb3,reminderservice,5,Mon May 4 15:58:31 2015 UTC,You are insinuating he did not exercise due care. It seems that the only way he can exercise due care in your eyes is to not be on the road. He was travelling at a reasonable speed in the correct lane and something changed outside of his control. Yes he has the responsibility to react appropriately and I would argue this is exercising due care. Unfortunately reality is a bitch and sometimes there is no time to react or foresee every change. Not being able to fully mitigate these changes does not automatically make you negligent or at fault.
perth,34teb3,perthtemp69,-5,Tue May 5 04:29:09 2015 UTC,I'm not insinuating anything.  I'm saying completely clearly that he did not exercise due care.  He rode so close to someone that one step was enough to make them collide. If a driver did that they would be reckless.  Take responsibility.

An accident can often cause shock and embarrassment and people frequently act strangely. I helped a woman after a car vs truck accident where the truck drove over the front of her car. The remainder of the car was pretty much untouched but the front was totalled and her biggest concern, while sitting in the crushed car, was where she'd left her handbag."

The slower you're going , the more relaxed and not worried about other traffic you are entitled to be, the faster you go, the more you trade off that entitlement to disregard your surroundings"

perth,34spv8,ginggs,3,Mon May 4 11:24:08 2015 UTC,"depends how you do it - i'm not really after the whole botanical garden outdoors scene. I want more of an american themed park with quality courses, entertainment, maybe a bar/cafe. You know like you see in the movies."
perth,34spv8,ginggs,2,Mon May 4 11:39:19 2015 UTC,Ideally I want to find an unused/unwanted somewhere to convert. A bar/cafe is a definite. Given that profit is the main goal and kids are the main audience it is a bit tricky to provide anything overly adult focused without alienating a whole demographic (aka school trips) but no doubt there is a happy medium (think adventure worlds night parties). If the interest for late night minigolf with drinks/entertainment was there it would have to be an opportunity to branch out.

Compared to many building in the city 10 storeys is not much (Still more than I would ever want to fall). And compared to buildings built in the 11th century 9 storeys is huge.

perth,34snh7,Untimely_Manner,0,Mon May 4 09:45:38 2015 UTC,You could save them an infringement if you take it. Real estate agents are only allowed to use two signs per house in an area. If they are selling two houses in an area then they are only allowed a maximum of 4 signs otherwise they can get a $200 littering infringement. The signs are peanuts to replace so if you take the extra signs making sure they are within the legal boundaries you are saving them a fortune in infringements.

Just be mindful the term ""you get what you pay for"" rings true for Real Estate, no advertising costs in this market... I would be looking closely at how the agent plans to market the property.  Professional photos, Feature property on Real Estate.com.au in this market as a minimum are a must."

perth,34t1iv,photowest,2,Mon May 4 11:42:09 2015 UTC,"My Desktop only feeds out to what the agency is registered to feed to and the arrangements the agency has with various providers. Example, you need to be a REIWA agent to use the REIWA website and some agencies pay higher subscription fees than others for their listings to appear with more prominence online, and considering that's where most people look these days for property it's kind of important.   All I'm saying is for OP to be diligent with the marketing and sale of his/her property.  Or maybe I missed your point?"
perth,34t1iv,meecrob11,1 point,Mon May 4 14:35:27 2015 UTC,"My point is that most agents push for vendor paid advertising and cite listings on the major realestate websites as a cost, when practically it isn't. It's a deceptive practice.  Like telling customers that their property needs to be a feature property on a website when it doesn't."
perth,34t1iv,photowest,3,Mon May 4 14:39:40 2015 UTC,"REA aren't a charity, they are a business, they charge and they charge a lot, that's a fact (when I first started Real Estate, you know, 2 weeks ago, it was like $120 per feature listing, now it's like $280).   They practically send us a bill.  Every agency is different, we have an arrangement that all our listings load to REA as Feature properties, because we do it this way it works out a lot cheaper for our clients vs an individual feature listing, we used to have 'standard' by default but people preferred feature listings.  I never tell people they need it, simply that it is what we do as that is the arrangement we have with the service provider, 100% transparency, never had someone not want to list because they wanted to save $100 in marketing and be lower down in the default search results.  I also have a print out of all the advertising costs BEFORE we start which I keep updated as providers up their charges, if a client doesn't want to spend money in a particular area, they don't have to. I even offer multiple suppliers for photographers so it doesn't seem like I'm colluding in anyway."

I did this from purchasing a data pack from RP data of local house sales. Cost maybe $200 i cant remember. worth every cent.  If i was you i would go meet with all the local real estate agents find one you like then just bargain on the commission til you are comfortable. If you are comfortable with X commission it is a win/win situation as they do everything and you are okay with their fee.

perth,34szq0,Aushiker,2,Mon May 4 08:43:42 2015 UTC,"A swag of national retailers have opened their doors in Fremantle as the port town's development pipeline swells to more than $1 billion.  Popular convenience store 7-Eleven has chosen the port city for the site of its first retail outlet in Western Australia after securing a seven-year lease with local landowner Hanny Properties.   Boost Juice has opened its doors at the opposite end of the mall, with both deals signalling a resurgence of interest in the once-struggling shopping strip.  Fremantle has battled high vacancy rates and poor levels of foot traffic in past years following years of under-investment in the town centre, which has buildings dating back to the 1850s.   But substantial investment from a number of local retail landowners, as well as investment heavyweights, is slowly drawing more retail interest back to the port, CBRE agent Craig Olde said.    ""Fremantle's retail market has had its challenges, [but] the city has a range of intrinsic advantages, including its unique heritage and character,"" Mr Olde said.  Silverleaf Properties, a property group owned by Gerard O'Brien, is midway through a $16.5 million upgrade of Fremantle's Atwell Arcade and is also in the process of gaining approval for an update of the iconic Fremantle Woolstores Shopping Centre.  Mr O'Brien's group has shelled out more than $80 million in the past three years, snapping up prime sites including Atwell Arcade, the Target building and the Fremantle Woolstores, for which it paid about $50 million in late 2014.  OWNERS UPGRADE RETAIL ASSETS  Property owners, including the Asian-backed Hanny Developments and Manning Estates, are also upgrading retail assets to improve occupancy rates and the tenancy mix throughout the port town, while the local council has tipped in about $500,000 for public works.  In addition, Sirona Capital's $220 million Kings Square development in Fremantle is being built by Leighton. Sirona has also funded the $97 million conversion of the Dalgety Woolstores apartment project known as Heirloom at a heritage-listed building on Queen Street.  ""The real focus is Sirona Capital developing Kings Square, but there's a concerted revitalisation going on across the board,"" CBRE agent Peter Agostino said. ""Fremantle was an area that used to thump, but it fell off a lot because it got a bit rundown and these vacancies opened up, but there's been an evolution … the council is pro-development and everyone is working together to get things happening again.""  The investment comes at a time when larger listed and private groups are showing more confidence in the strength of Western Australia's retail market and upping their investments throughout Perth and the state's south-western region.   AMP Capital is progressing with a $750 million development application at its Garden City Booragoon shopping centre out of a $2.8 billion pipeline, which includes 38,000 square metres of new space at its Ocean Keys centre in a $108 million expansion.   Lend Lease has just completed its two-stage $300 million expansion at the Lakeside Joondalup Shopping Centre, with the first new Myer store in Perth for 20 years, while Scentre Group is progressing a large-scale development proposal at the Carousel Shopping Centre in Canning.   Novion in late 2014 completed an 8967-square-metre expansion at Warnbro Centre and the Perron Group opened its $100 million expansion at Cockburn Gateway Shopping Centre."

Plus again when i was learning to drive I was taught when turning right onto 2 lanes, you turn into right lane then indicate left and move over once round corner. Well seems since many people couldn't wrap their heads around this concept now it seems it is OK to end up in the left lane in such a scenario.

It's not as if stopped any or many people. Every now and then there's been a blitz in the CBD and a few unlucky riders get fined.  I'm not going to be riding any more or less on the footpath. I'll only do it where I deem it safer for the trip, or sections of thereof.   Roads or dedicated shared paths generally speaking can get me from A to B a lot more safely and quickly; whether A & B is between home and the local Deli, 700 metres away or even A & B is Armadale & Bullsbrook."
perth,34omfg,CyanideRemark,27,Sun May 3 03:45:50 2015 UTC,"This is so, so much safer than riding alongside cars. Finally"
perth,34omfg,tomeoftom,18,Sun May 3 02:53:53 2015 UTC,"Better for the cyclists, but not pedestrians. Many of our paths are basically single file. If cyclists are allowed to use them they need to do it with manners. I haven’t been riding lately, so I’ve been experiencing it from the point of view of a pedestrian, and many adult cyclists who currently ride on footpaths do so aggressively and often without proper signalling (by the way, calling out ‘ding ding’ vocally is just a bad idea)."
perth,34omfg,jnd-au,8,Sun May 3 04:32:55 2015 UTC,"Selfish dickheads will continue to exist, and certainly there should be laws against endangering people by riding too fast, too close to pedestrians, but the physics of the two options are so vastly different.  Cars travel much faster and weigh a lot more than bicycles, which makes them much harder to stop suddenly and much more deadly. A bike travelling very fast on a tight, low-visibility footpath is probably already doing something wrong, and could likely do some serious harm if it hit a pedestrian at full speed. That's a bad-but-not-worst-case scenario.   A car usually weighs a significant fraction of a tonne, is probably travelling around 50 km/h by default, and is passing by cyclists with often 1.5m or less to spare - that's pretty much how most car/bicycle interactions work. A cyclist being hit by a car in this very normal scenario is far more likely to die than a pedestrian being hit by a bicycle in the worst of cases - and it's so much easier/safer for bikes to brake and divert around a pedestrian (or just dismount) than for a car to deal with a slow cyclist who is dangerously occupying the middle of the road - the ambiguity as to whether you should proceed around the cyclist and enter the oncoming lane or hover behind at 15-30 km/h until it becomes safe is a very confusing and dangerous thing.  This law gives the best of both worlds as a stopgap for installing more safe cycle lanes - if you need speed, you are probably an experienced (and therefore safe) cyclist and you can use the road as normal, ideally planning your regular routes around cycle lanes. If you're not as accustomed to cycling or are making an ad-hoc route, you can move slower but much safer on the footpaths."
perth,34omfg,tomeoftom,4,Sun May 3 07:25:00 2015 UTC,"As a cyclist/bike rider/driver/road & foot path user I certainly concede there is an element of ""rider"" that certainly does Bicycle advocacy no good whatsoever.    I would tar the selfish, go-fast weekend warrior shared path rider who barrels joggers, mums and prams alike with the same brush as selfish, ignorant motorists yelling at all bikes to 'get off the road'.  These self delusional heros by not wanting to join an organised club or group to train and race are turning paths, shared or otherwise into the same arteries of agro that the roads have been for longer.  We could almost liken them to hoons not raving at properly organised amateur events like at the Motorplex or Barbagallo Raceway.  A little more concern and less self centeredness for a fellow human goes a long way. I do my best not generalise all ""cyclists"" as selfish c*nts, or all motorists as impatient or inattentive; but the one eyed view in these debates totally decrying the 'other side' as purely at fault is really frustating."

If I could though go back to your first comment; riding on the road is also safer when car drivers pay attention to their surroundings. Footpaths may only cover less than 5-10% of my journey by bike. Point being; footpaths are hardly ever the sole route option on a bike journey.  I don't think the repeal of this law is going to change much at all in terms of peoples habits. It was one of these laws that people for the most  ignored anyway, save for the occasional token Police Blitz in the CBD.   I still maintain the issue is broader and needs to be addressed with education on both sides and more comprehensive infrastructure.

perth,34omfg,Azinater,2,Sun May 3 09:47:06 2015 UTC,"I think it is a matter of common sense and making the decision as conditions allow; I recently moved out of CBD where I rode 400km a week and barely drove 50km by car (car is over 10 years old and still under 75,000km) but since moving NOR I can tell many drivers are not used to sharing with cyclists and I don't feel safe in same way I would in city, depsite there being barley 1/10 the amount of cars so I just ride on footpaths by main roads.   The fact that it has been illegal is a rather observed.  Things to watch out for though are cars coming out of drive ways and you really need to ring bell or notify people when you are approaching, particularly  from behind as people can be unpredictable  and you don't want to run into them."

Cyclists can also massively hold up a road with a truck or other large vehicles on it which is again too big to over take the cyclists on any road that's single lane."

Therefore I stick to the footpaths as much as is possible, as I know that being stuck behind a cyclist like me on the road as a driver is....irritating at best.  However I always consider that pedestrians have right of way. Further to that I fell the onus is on the bike riders, so I will take pains to ensure that any pedestrians I encounter are aware of me long before I come past (that's one of the reasons you should have a bell fitted to your bike in WA) and then when riding past slow and give a wide berth to avoid startling any walker that hasn't worked out I am there.

Don't get me wrong, there are cyclists who are fucking morons and give the rest of the group a bad name too, I know that. I suppose I just feel that separating cyclists and drivers isn't going to solve the problem because overall drivers are still pretty intolerant of cyclists/motorcyclists/buses/trucks/trains/trams/pedestrians."

Sometimes design also leads how well a product fits and that's where a certain style/design can become objectively better.   Fit: depends entirely on the shape of your head, subjective.   Don't agree, objectively there are some that fit significantly better than others.  You can tell is objectively better because you don't get red marks where they digging into your head/nose and they don't slip off your face.  Once you have reached a certain level of good fit only then would it become subjective.   Material: 99% are made from plastic with maybe a little bit of steel.

Necessity doesn't drive every purchasing decision or you wouldn't own a house, car and clothes.    Titanium frames are desirable because they are lighter and stronger than competing materials.    They are more comfortable to wear for long periods due to the lack of weight and more likely to survive an encounter with an angry three year old.

perth,34mdhv,zulumonkey,5,Sat May 2 17:49:46 2015 UTC,"I have been playing csgo for a while and if you want you can message me about it.   Generally, 60-80 ping isnt so bad. If you want to improve it, change your service provider to Amnet, as they have really good routing to east states, you will get a more 50-70 average. I use a VPN when playing on east servers. I know it may sound strange, but when playing on an eastern states server, it feels my packets have better priority going over a VPN than going over raw. (obviously a VPN within the city that the server is located in). On higher pings, you simply change your playstyle.   1. Do not hold lines, this will get you killed. This is because people on lower pings have peakers advantage.  2. Do quick peaks around corners to hold lines instead 3. Do not spray. Yes on LAN or local pings you may be able to get away with this, but on higher pings, you spray will be very unreliable. CSGO spray in game is not a representation of what it is on server, the higher the ping, the the bigger that difference is. 4. Learn to tap shots.     Most of this stuff is good for general cs anyway. Also, do not play on services like MM. Sign up for ESEA, or Unity CSGO or Faceit, much higher quality of players there."

perth,34mdhv,masked_shirtfronter,2,Sat May 2 13:42:22 2015 UTC,You should be able to get 45-50 ping from Perth. Turn off interleaving at your ISP to reduce your ping by 10ms.  The difference between 50 ping and 10 isn't really much. I think at 80 you may have a small disadvantage.
perth,34mdhv,reptelic,3,Sat May 2 18:35:01 2015 UTC,"I don't play CSGO, but when I played 1.6 years ago, I was in the same situation, it can work to your advantage after awhile, as you start to predict and preemptively shoot, and your reaction rate increases because you're always on edge because of your disadvantage."

The Singaporean PC-21s also based at Pearce do have ADS-B and can regularly be seen on FlightRadar doing circuits at Gingin and generally tooling around more-or-less in the area between those two airfields, if anyone is super-bored ;)"
perth,34laza,mrmratt,2,Tue May 5 12:08:56 2015 UTC,"For installation of ADS-B equipment there'd likely be an external antenna, which immediately brings about the 'major engineering'. Similarly for a fixed installation of GPS (for power etc).  There was supposed to have been a fleet wide Electronic Flight Instrumentation System and GPS upgrade in 2007/8, however I don't think that went ahead. It could potentially have included ADS-B. https://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.advert.showClosed&AdvertUUID=0F398658-DC94-2683-C9531FEDD37A553F  As far as 'need' goes, most civil aircraft of that age in Australia, and most military aircraft do not have ADS-B, so there'd be little justification for installation, especially this close to end-of-life of the fleet."

If finances are an issue try and find a bulk billing one.

The buildings and streets don't create new things, they can only speak of the people in the past who were creative and creating.  The great cities and movements of tomorrow are in fetal form around us right now, in the nutjobs we call friends and family, in this mundane urban and suburban existence.

Most people in Australia are not of indigenous descent and are not musicians, so we don't play didgeridoo. England invaded Australia, so in many regions, having non-aborigines offering didgeridoo services is generally considered stealing other people's culture and profiting from colonial subjugation – having others offering didgeridoo is a gift to be earned rather than taken.

perth,34h4yn,djskein,9,Sat May 2 04:56:36 2015 UTC,I used to work there. There was a drive thru once. Then they extended the store into the drive thru and didn't add any windows. So now it feels like it's underground.   Maybe they closed the drive thru because I accidentally let a drunk woman steal ten bottles of spirits when I went to get her a carton from the walk-in fridge. Or maybe it was the time that I was on drive thru and the neon sign fell on a car. Maybe I accidentally contributed to the drive thru being loss making.   Maybe this is all my fault.

perth,3491xe,tinesy,9,Wed Apr 29 07:05:37 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry to hear you had a bad experience.  I'm an RN at one of the other public hospitals and try so hard for my patients to have a pleasant enough time with us as difficult as it can be sometimes.  Unfortunately some doctors just have no people skills and regardless of all that training some just have got no clue how to talk to patients.  Was the problem just with the doctor or with other aspects of your care?  Your best bet is probably getting in touch with the ward manager or CNS (Clinical Nurse Specialist).  This will be the nurse in charge and they are usually really good at things like this.  They take complaints and should take them very seriously.  If you were talking to a more junior doctor they can pass along your complaint to the consultant in charge - if it's other things they can handle them appropriately, usually by passing them through to the consumer liaison department or other complaints people.   Best way to do this is probably by ringing the ward and either asking for a contact number or leaving your details for them to get back to you. Hope this helps."
perth,3491xe,urbanvanilla,8,Wed Apr 29 07:09:41 2015 UTC,"I'm also really sorry to hear about how bad the experience was and hope everything works out okay. I think its fair to go and make a complaint and report what happened so that the system can improve. From what you describe (and not being there myself) I would wonder if they just genuinely didn't know about your situation - it'd be ridiculous to expect each doctor to know about each and every single patient in ED (especially if they aren't based in ED). I could be wrong, and maybe that doctor was involved in your care and should've been more aware in which case I hope they learn from the experience.  I know the above reply wasn't trying to be offensive, but it's not just 'some doctors' that would make a mistake like this, it could easily happen with every staff member in the hospital, other patients, every other profession outside the hospital and even in casual situations - it's about awareness in social interaction and like I said, it's not easy to know what will and won't offend every single person around you, particularly if you're not talking directly to that person.  Again, I really hope everything works out for you and hope you don't have any further experiences like this as your pregnancy goes on."
perth,3491xe,recycled_ideas,0,Wed Apr 29 12:35:19 2015 UTC,I presented early pregnancy with bleeding and cramps. Likely miscarriage. Second one in a year. I waited for hours to get a blood test. Understand why that took an hour to get results there. Then 45 min for anti d shot. This was when id be ignored while nurses and doctors discussing private lives.   Today an hour and a half sitting in ED triage while still likely miscarrying. Was told would be next. Four went in front of me who were walking on their own violation. Had to create a scene to get in. Was hen asked why I didn't go to PREGNANCY early care. Because ultrasound in hospital told me to go back to ED. Told letter would take 5 min. 45 min later left.
perth,3491xe,FutureSynth,12,Wed Apr 29 07:18:25 2015 UTC,"Don't take this the wrong way, but what exactly is your complaint concerning?  An hour seems quite fast for a blood test and 45 isn't outrageous for the shot. You were in a public hospital waiting for results with no treatment that could be administered.  Sure the doctor probably should have been more considerate, assuming he knew what your circumstances were, and Fiona Stanley needs to get its shit together about where patients present, but it sounds like you presented and received appropriate medical care in a reasonably timely fashion. You didn't get much in the way of non clinical care, but you won't in any WA public hospital.  Feel free to complain, the link appears to have been provided, but don't expect much result. WA doesn't do continuity of care in any public hospital, or much holistic care. You'll receive what is medically necessary and not much else. This sucks as a patient, but it's how things are, and realistically so long as the clinical treatments are timely and appropriate there are worse things."

Also add the local fishing Facebook pages if you wish. Fishing in Perth is great and on most days you can catch a feed or better from shore.  Currently Perth has been experience the best Salmon run in years.  The North Mole in Fremantle, Woodmans Point and Rockingham Jetty have been producing -  you just have to be there at the time the school rocks up.    Take your small rod with a 20g Halco Twist Lure (6 bucks worth).   Just make sure you line is good quality around 20 pound.  To catch a feed near you I would be trying for whiting, herring and tailor off Trigg Beach.  Also the river is full of Bream and Flathead. Learn to use lures for flatties or fish at night in the river. Blowies will shit down after dark as long as their is not much artificial light around.  Good luck and fish for the future."

perth,345fxt,photowest,-1,Wed Apr 29 11:21:54 2015 UTC,A little tip for fishing in the swan.   Use the mussels youll find clinging to jettys and peirs as bait. Put your hook through the shell and drop it down. The blowies wont be interested in it but the Bream eat the mussels so they will go for it.   Just make sure you only get little ones (size of two fingernails)

Be thankful our L plate rules aren't as extreme as what those in VIC (150 hours, 2 years) and NSW (mandatory hours of night driving, limited to 90km/h, hours driven with an instructor count 3x more then regular hours) go through while you're at it!"
perth,347zwc,nahcoob,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:49:05 2015 UTC,That's terrible that hours driven with a professional instructor count more. It just adds an extra cost barrier making it more difficult for low-income earners to get their license.
perth,347zwc,whatahorribleman,9,Wed Apr 29 02:17:57 2015 UTC,The reason instructors hours are worth more is that instructors are actually good at teaching not like parents.  Ever since parents have been doing the majority of hours the quality of younger drivers on our roads has declined rapidly.  Parents pass on the their bad habits onto their kids.   Exceptions may exist.  I'm generalising of course.
perth,347zwc,dzernumbrd,3,Wed Apr 29 03:06:52 2015 UTC,"You are probably correct about your first point, but incorrect on your second.   The data on page 11 of this document shows a downward trend for the involvement of fatal road crashes in young drivers, disproving the assertion that young driver quality has declined since the introduction of parental supervision.  The data suggests to me that the single biggest reduction in young driver fatalities would come from a specialised education programme for young country drivers."
perth,347zwc,whatahorribleman,2,Wed Apr 29 03:28:45 2015 UTC,"There is more to quality driving than not dying though.  If fatalities was the metric for quality then we could all drive around at 5km/hr and be rated the highest 'quality' drivers in the world.  There is obviously a balance to struck between risk and reward.  Drivers need to understand how to take risks, when it is appropriate and when it isn't etc.  I think being trained by the risk averse isn't giving them well rounded education."
perth,347zwc,dzernumbrd,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:50:34 2015 UTC,"Those stats also don't tell us shit.  Each new car has better safety standards than the last, a decline in fatalities could easily be attributed to that and not drivers getting better."
perth,347zwc,enceladus7,2,Wed Apr 29 05:04:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not denying that either (I did almost all my hours with instructors mainly due to a lack of suitable car before I purchased one shortly prior to taking the PDA) but I think from an equity perspective having instructors (in which there are also plenty of horrendous ones out there, albeit that's a different context to been taught by parents) hours count 3x more then regular hours is a bit over the top/not really fair for people who can't afford thousands of dollars to spend several hours (considering it averages at $60-70/hr) with an instructor."
perth,347zwc,nahcoob,0,Wed Apr 29 03:09:42 2015 UTC,$60-$70 is definitely in the very top end of the market. Not the average.
perth,347zwc,jophesaur,2,Thu Apr 30 12:34:42 2015 UTC,"Perhaps for 40/45mins... But for an hour? Never seen anything below $50, I'd say $60 is the average."

perth,347zwc,littleblackcat,6,Wed Apr 29 01:23:09 2015 UTC,"I got an extraordinary licence when I was a kid so I could help on my parents farm. Had to get approval from the minister of transport. As a result I didn't do my L plates and went straight to Ps. I had conditions that I could only drive between the two farms and to the towns closest to each one on work business (the farms were in different shires).  Bear in mind this was in 1996 so things may have changed but it's worth checking it out. Have a look at the DoT website.   I should have mentioned this to begin with, my extraordinary was incredibly rare. I have never met anyone else who managed to get one. But good luck anyway.

I think it's time to get my scope out."
perth,340leb,VMaxF1,2,Mon Apr 27 16:32:45 2015 UTC,just remember stars twinkle and planets dont.
perth,340leb,x0rms,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:10:57 2015 UTC,Urban myth I'm afraid. The twinkling is caused by atmospheric distortion and the light from a star is no different to the light from a planet. Both are subject to twinkling. You might notice it less on Venus because the overall size is larger but twinkling is just the same on mercury as it is on the stars.
perth,340leb,crosstherubicon,2,Tue Apr 28 01:37:55 2015 UTC,Yep. Another random thing subject to twinkling: streetlights far away. Which are still quite a bit closer than planets :)
perth,340leb,x0rms,2,Tue Apr 28 02:42:58 2015 UTC,"It's called scintillation and AFAIK it actually only happens with stars, and not planets due to planets being closer and 'bigger' due to their proximity with the viewer (us Earthlings), meaning that although they still appear as spicks in the sky, they are close enough that the reflected light has a larger trajectory than distant stars, reducing the 'twinkle'."
perth,340leb,crosstherubicon,2,Wed Apr 29 06:58:57 2015 UTC,"Not quite right. The scintillation only occurs in the final few kilometres of the lights path through the atmosphere. It doesn't matter whether the light came from alpha centauri a couple of light years away or Mars, several light minutes away. Only the last few kilometres make any difference and the distortion phenomena doesn't anything about where the light came from."
perth,340leb,x0rms,2,Thu Apr 30 04:04:52 2015 UTC,"Can I ask then, why I look at Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars in the night sky, first hand, they are not twinkling, whereas stars are?"
perth,340leb,crosstherubicon,2,Thu Apr 30 04:48:19 2015 UTC,They're slightly larger in terms of angular diameter and the cumulative effect of the twinkling tends to average out across the observable disc. A star is significantly smaller and the twinkling is more observable. If you look at something small underwater its more difficult to discern than a similarly larger object for the same  reason. The moon doesn't appear to twinkle to the naked eye however if you look at a small area of the moon through a telescope then the disturbance of the atmosphere (twinkling) is clearly visible.
perth,340leb,DCknowitall,2,Thu Apr 30 05:52:21 2015 UTC,I just find this difficult to get my head around as I've looked at the moon through an array of telescopes and never observed it twinkle.
perth,340leb,nitnitwickywicky,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:25:20 2015 UTC,"You're right, when looking at the moon through a telescope you don't see it twinkle so much as shimmering like a mirage. Think about a car in the distance on a hot road. But, if the moon was replaced with a much smaller point source of light, a star, then the shimmer becomes what we call twinkling."

perth,33zv2i,daaargh,2,Mon Apr 27 04:39:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, when ever I need a statutory declaration signed or certified copies of documents signed, I just pop into the nearest pharmacy. Sometimes you have to pay a ""gold coin donation"" to whatever charity tin they have to stop people abusing the system.  If you have a bunch of documents that need signing/witnessing/certification, check your local library. They usually have a day each week where a JP is available to do this for you.  EDIT: For clarification: there is a list of professions that are allowed to certify a document.

perth,33zv2i,pigferret,6,Mon Apr 27 07:18:51 2015 UTC,"Yep, definitely different.   Justices of the Peace (JPs) in Australia provide services similar to American notaries, but are not permitted to witness documents for use in foreign countries. Notaries have this exclusive right and are the only true international ""JP's"" in Australia.  Notaries Public affix their official seal (usually impressed onto a red sticker) or stamp, onto documents immediately under, adjacent or as near as possible to their signatures.  All Notaries' seals and signatures are officially recorded in a data base held by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), an Australian government department authorised to issue Apostille or Authentication Certificates certifying that the signatures, seals or stamps of Notaries on Australian public documents are geniune.  Public Notaries also have their signatures, seals or stamps registered with their State or Territory Supreme Court to whom they are answerable to, and with their local Notary Society, if one exists in their State or Territory, and if a member."

Even back when Western Australia had a referendum at the beginning of the 20th century, only our state got to vote"
perth,33xguu,SonOfTheSohoRiots,5,Sun Apr 26 16:49:24 2015 UTC,"We had a referendum in 1933 which passed; Westminster said it would need to be a federal referendum because of our Constitution and how it established the commonwealth. A lot has changed since then, so a new attempt might go differently - definitely wouldn't go to the UK Parliament, at least.

Personally I would vote no and I think most of my friends and family would do too.

The Quebec example though is a much better comparison to WA. Quebec is a state just like WA and they have had 2 referendums, in each one only people in Quebec were able to vote.

perth,33xguu,theenglishguy72,0,Tue Apr 28 06:02:38 2015 UTC,"That is basically true for all independence referendums. The idea is that if the majority of people vote yes, then the international pressure will be so great that they will have to allow them to split.  Allowing an independence referendum to happen in the first place basically suggests that the government wishes to respect the result. Getting the vote to happen is usually the biggest challenge"

The Spanish government aren't likely to allow that as a) Catalonia is one of the richest regions bringing in money to the economy and b) then the Basque region has a precedent set for a vote and the potential for autonomy."

Around the start of the Bibblulmun Track and Kalamunda National Park is really nice, have a look on the Shire of Kalamunda website there are a dozen or so short walks. My personal favourite is Jorgensen Park, it was Kalamunda's golf course until it closed a few decades ago. It is great for aimless wondering and a peaceful walk  Also around Lesmurdie Falls is really pretty, great views too. Might be better to go after some heavy rain though - doubt there will be much water at the moment.  Lots of railway trails too around here too, but they get a more cyclists and aren't really hiking at all. If you have any questions let me know!  EDIT: Here is the link to a few good short walks. I've done a couple and they were great.  http://www.kalamunda.wa.gov.au/Leisure-Tourism/Tourism/Walking-Trails"

perth,33x3cj,theenglishguy72,3,Mon Apr 27 02:49:02 2015 UTC,"The golf course is a designated off lead dog walking area so its a great place to let them off to have a run too. In my experience (we've walked our dog regularly there for 5 years) most dogs won't be on a lead. Common sense applies of course, if your dog is agressive towards others, best to leave it at home. Even if it's on a lead, other dogs are likely to come have a sniff.   There's also a fenced kids playground and a couple of gas bbq's so you can walk the dog around the circuit (about 4kms) then let the kids play for a bit. In late autumn, early winter when it's all greened up it's stunning."

I was caught by a camera about 18 months ago allegedly doing 115 in an 80. I was pretty surprised because I do not make a habit of speeding. Besides, I was on my way home from work and in no rush to get anywhere.   I did a lot of research online about the camera and how it is supposed to be set up in order to accurately gauge a motorist's speed. The ticket ($700 thank you very much) revealed the exact location of the camera.   I went to check it out the following day and noticed the camera set up again in that very same spot. It was on a rather steep incline and well above the minimum 5 degree incline that's outlined in the manufacturer's documentation I found online.  Long story short, I had a pretty good case so I contested it. Gathered all my research and print outs on the big day and the dude didn't even show up."

As for the /r/perth sidebar being a place for advertising WA or Perth specific subs; as a few others commented with the recent req. by /u/sagerian (I think?) since the related sub list was collapsed, traffic to them has dropped off.  But conversely, where do you draw the line at adding every new half baked sub that gets dreamt up?

Your point is still valid but it's interesting that iPhones aren't as small a % as you might initially expect.  Guys, I'm not saying iPhone > Android and I'm not saying defending morons who lump iPad into every tablet (etc.). All I'm saying is that the statistic is interesting.

I agree that iPhone market share is much less here, but given that iPhone wifi usage is above market share in the US, I see no reason why it wouldn't be here as well.   Can you think of any reason why you think wifi usage in Australia would more accurately reflect general market share? I'd be interested to read!  Some stats in the US have wifi for iPhones in the high 70s low 80s if I recall correctly. I'm not going to presume what that means (one of the stats was for airflight wifi which might only indicate a disparity of wealth - I'm guessing only).  In no way shape or form did I imply, in any way, that calling them iPhones isn't stupid. I, quite literally, said that what he was saying is valid and that it is only an interesting statistic.

The problem was it took half the bus ride to set it up and would frequently drop out - I can't see it being any different here. On the upgraded routes that had wifi, the cost was so high that they couldn't afford to build new bus shelters. Really I think we should get the all basics sorted out before we start splashing out on nice things like this.

It's very easy to get to, go down the freeway and get off at Erindale Road, turn off at North Beach Road and follow the roundabouts to a street called Water Crest Gardens.   It's so lush and tranquil walking around that area. It was a bit dark because I went down around 1:30am but I still thought it was so good, it even managed to outdo the wetlands area on Salter Point Parade near where I live. There's an interesting array of different nocturnal sounds I heard whilst walking around. I can't believe this is all located in a tiny reserve area in Gwelup, an area I never gave two shits about until last night. I feel jealous for all the multi million dollar mansions located across the road from these wetlands and the incredible view and sounds they get to see and hear every night.   Only think I ever knew about Gwelup was that the berk who ran out onto the freeway near Mount Henry Bridge and headbutted cars was reported to be from Gwelup."

Thus why it has never really been highlighted/found as such until recently.   The other wetlands nearby are nice but are not even close to as visually appealing. The swamps in Carine open space have some areas that look very similar but you have to  get very messy and walk through the swampy areas to actually reach them.

Ring around fishing tackle shops and see if any answer the phone? perhaps any of the smaller shops that are dotted around the beach, river or IGAs very close to the coast or river  might be able to help too."

Otherwise, I would suggest hitting up work colleagues to go out after work, go to their house parties even... And tell them you're having trouble finding friends...

Which from that ridiculous name, sounds like some kind of program for over 60 yr olds haha, but it's not.   Other stuff you could do maybe volunteer? Animal shelters or community events... Not sure where you live but heaps of the city-fringe areas have a lot of community events and are always looking for people to organise things.   Going to bars alone is scary but I don't think weird... Suggest maybe places with original live music... You mind find a good crowd at those sorts of things.   Definitely be honest though IMO...

I've thought about volunteering, maybe I should look into that again as I'm a huge animal lover.  As for bars, yeah would have to be careful.

perth,33s2fe,Untimely_Manner,1 point,Sat Apr 25 07:26:31 2015 UTC,"My story too; I moved here from Melbourne about 4 years ago when I was 20. For 6 months, I had a difficult time making friends and had lots of downtime. Saturday nights usually consisted of pizza and Friends re-runs.  At first, I gave up on Perth and moved back to Melbourne. Spent 6 months there, but I ended up missing it here. Too much to see and do in WA that I hadn't, I felt like I wanted to be back.  That's changed a lot. I have a fairly large group to the point where I struggle to keep up at times. But reflection, most friends haven't come from social groups or sports for myself.  Majority of friends have been through work or university or housemates. These are honestly the three areas where you make friends the most, and it's worth having these three (or at least work and housemates) as areas where you can be friends with them, it makes life a little bit easier.  I thought doing sports and social groups would help, but it didn't quite. Through university, it mostly came from needing to study together for an assignment or exam, or just hanging out in the tavern in free periods. Next thing, you're catching up over beer, parties etc. Work, usually suggesting after work drinks or catch-ups as a group helped a lot. As well, due to the relations you have with co-workers, you can't talk too much socially during shift/the day. Hanging out afterwards is usually a shared concept, I would give it a go. Also, I have friends which I have met in pubs/bars on drinking adventures.  Honestly, sometimes it takes persisting and connecting with one person. Having one friend can introduce you to their friends, which will just expand constantly."

perth,33nlq0,Aushiker,3,Fri Apr 24 00:00:43 2015 UTC,"Lucky for the state govt, nobody listens to Peter Newman.  So they can just keep doing that I suppose.  I think Leach hwy people have been sold something of a pig in a poke over this.  Divert container traffic - ok.  They'll have to basically force them to change routes, but this will be a massively high tech revenue raising operation.  There'll be cameras all over it making sure every truck goes where it's supposed to and gets fined heavily if it doesn't.  But there's still this fantasy I've encountered that there'll be no trucks on Leach hwy then, which is idiotic of course.  A pretty high percentage of large freight on that road is stuff that has to be there because it needs to get where it's going.  People do seem to think this though.  Back when the Fremantle bypass was a thing there were people parading around the story of how their daughter died in a crash with a truck on Leach somewhere and how much the bypass would help (or at least I think that was the argument).  What I remember was looking at the report and the truck in question was a big delivery van.  The kind of thing that's not going away until teleportation is invented, really."
perth,33nlq0,Muzorra,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:52:10 2015 UTC,"So the government is going to force trucks to use this new road? Trucks aren't going to willingly spend $10+ each time they use the road if it is only 5 minutes quicker than Leach Hwy. Sure some large freight companies might like the reliability and be okay with the toll, but I know there will be plenty who won't be."
perth,33nlq0,theenglishguy72,1 point,Fri Apr 24 08:13:07 2015 UTC,"Yup.  Truckies have been surprisingly quiet on the whole thing (although there was an article by some expressing doubts a while ago).  I'd suspect there's some reluctance to been seen as anti-development or anti-road.  I think the majority of road freight out of the port is hauled by owner-operators.  People doing that particular run probably don't have a representative body to put out press releases or whatever, and more large scale groups probably side with the road lobby.  Just as a guess.  I'm only surmising how they'll actually police this from the odd remark and line in a document here and there.  The thing has been pretty vague for a while about key details and I'm not well versed.  But its key promises are to make money, not penalise ordinary drivers and divert heavy load traffic from certain roads.  There's only one main method I can see to actually deliver all these and still have the thing function as a road and that's ruthless computer controlled monitoring.  You come out of the port and you get tagged, toll gets taken, that sort of thing.  Then cameras along the route check on you at various intervals.  Cameras on Leach Hwy will fine you for not following Stock road/the Roe extension.  And the fine will be steep.  If you're coming from the port to Canning Vale or Kewdale area, there'll be only one route you can take.  That's the only way I can imagine this actually guaranteeing those outcomes."
perth,33nlq0,Muzorra,5,Sat Apr 25 01:26:53 2015 UTC,"Northlink, which is part of this project is definitely not a waste of money considering the horrendous quality of the road links to Ellenbrook and surrounding areas that it will assist with.   The Stock Rd/Leach Hwy/High Rd upgrades... The money could probably be put to better use."
perth,33nlq0,nahcoob,2,Fri Apr 24 03:11:37 2015 UTC,"Not sure if Northlink is included in the same $1.6bn fund but I know in terms of actual projects they are called 'NorthLink' and 'FreightLink', as two separate entities.  But yes, Northlink is definiely needed. It will provide good access to Ellenbrook, ease heavy traffic through the Swan Valley and remove some major pinch points along the existing Tonkin north area.  I know years ago, even with the outer port being looked at down Cockburn way, it was still deemed Roe 8 was important. It would go through to Stock Rd and then Stock Rd would be upgraded both north and south to allow for port traffic in both directions. It removed heavy vehicle movements from Kwinana and Leach.  The last leg of High Rd is the part that doesn't make sense to me. It will be the hardest part of hte whole thing to do, the most costly part and it wasn't on any planning radar at all (as far as I know).  EDIT:  FreightLink is $1.6bn in itself - https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/BuildingRoads/Projects/UrbanProjects/Pages/Perth-Freight-Link.aspx  Northlink is separate and is a different $1.1bn - https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/BuildingRoads/Projects/UrbanProjects/Pages/NorthlinkWA.aspx"

I drove through it a few times over the last couple of days, not by choice but because I travel frequently from Leach Highway to Canning Highway on the freeway as it's the only way to get around from my place.

Like all those variable message signs? Like all the static paper billboards strewn around the metro area? I drive past this everyday, the first time I noticed it and thought 'oh cool', it barely drew my attention on subsequent trips. Why? Because I'm not stupid enough to be distracted by anything while I'm driving. I was actually surprised that something like this got approved in The Wild West but then my first thought was 'it won't last long as all the Perth numpties will complain that it's distracting'. Of course that's exactly what happened. Is Perth really that pathetic in its collective thinking?"

Email page 1 Email page 2   “My phone is fairly useless, and would not let me download the app I needed to show the tickets.”   Are you sure it’s the phone that’s useless?   “I brandished my phone in my hand and prepared myself for the most passionate anti-samsung monologue “………..Blah Blah Blah………. “One metre. Here we go, this is it, I took in a deep breath, and – walked right past her.”   She wasn’t a bouncer, I’m sure they just wanted to comply with venue capacity requirements.   “If this experience is anything to go on, it seems that e-tickets are a lot like Fetch – it just isn’t going to happen.”   It was your phone that had the issue. I’m sure if you had waited in line like everyone else, they could have helped you. The line was moving swiftly due to most being able to operate a phone.   “I was expecting to be surrounded by like minded people between 18 and 25, keenly paying attention, note taking devices in hand. This isn’t what I got.”   So you are disappointed that your assumptions were wrong? What do they say about assumptions again?   “Instead, I walked into a crowd of about 200 people in their mid-to-late forties”   This is just a flat out lie. There were people of all ages. It was a very diverse crowd.    “I wish that CrypoParty was an event full of young, switched-on minds, bustling with the quiet hum of activism and protest. I wish it was a place in space and time where like minded young people could congregate and network during an educational conference regarding our nation’s changing intelligence operations and their implications for us as a whole, but it wasn’t.”   So just because it was a diverse crowd you were disappointed? Should older people have been excluded just because it’s what you wish? Get the fuck out.   “To put it bluntly, CryptoParty was kind of a cringefest.”   This is where I have to stop.

We can all argue til we're black and blue here that speed cameras are/are not useful, that speeding between 1-10km/h over the limit isn't that bad or whatever, or that it's the law and you have to follow it.  But the real question is, if there were no speed cameras, there is a large hole in the budget. 100% of the revenue from speed cameras goes to the Road Trauma Fund. In 2011, the revenue from speed cameras was $105.28 million, I assume it's at least 20% more than that now given the fine increases, the amount of cameras deployed and the general static nature of the amount of people speeding.  So my point is, you can make as much noise as you want that speed cameras are revenue raisers, but at least if you're making that argument, provide some solutions to the $100m+ black hole it will leave if we remove them."

Most Car insurance companies keep in their fine print a clause that says if you get caught using your car as a commercial taxi you invalidate any claim.   Most these people are paying car insurance and wont get to use it, if the company gets wind of their activities.  Don't get me wrong, I think the taxi industry needs a bloody good shake up and Uber is the mechanism to do that. But I think these drivers are driving on borrowed time and it isn't going to end well."

perth,33ii2i,atsugnam,3,Thu Apr 23 12:08:46 2015 UTC,You misunderstand.  Uber cover drivers while on the job only.  If the drivers don't declare their vehicles being used for commercial  purposes then they can't claim on their personal insurance even if the damage was done out side of work hours.  Just using the car for commercial purposes permanently invalidates the insurances terms.  These people are paying for insurance they can't claim on.
perth,33ii2i,senectus,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:15:43 2015 UTC,"Thinking about it, they probably can't get any personal insurance or commercial insurance for use as a taxi because it won't meet the right underwriting criteria as a taxi.   Surely Uber has thought of this and covers them 24/7."

perth,33ii2i,gattaaca,1 point,Fri Apr 24 08:39:25 2015 UTC,"This is a dubious claim: there's very little information on this available from insurers short of calling them, and it's completely legitimate to use a personal vehicle for work without it registered as a commercial vehicle (see tax claims for personal motor vehicle use and the fantastic career of pizza driving)  Also my own experience claiming on my personal insurance while driving the car as a pizza delivery driver. The insurer was told that I use the car for work and they only wanted to know if I was working at the time of the accident.  Edit: I also didn't find mention of commercial use of vehicle anywhere in some of the PDS from some insurers. It would be very hard to invalidate a claim for a reason that's not in the PDS."

perth,33ii2i,atsugnam,1 point,Sat Apr 25 11:23:15 2015 UTC,"I dont think they see it that way. When you ring up and organize insurance they ask you then if its going to be used for commercial purposes..  Even this article talks about it:  http://www.buzzfeed.com/kenbensinger/ubers-yawning-insurance-gap#.xfD97V21aZ   The DMV says that is improper. “There’s not a shade of gray on it,” said Andrew Conway, branch chief of registration policy at the DMV. “If you use the vehicle for commercial purposes, even occasionally, it has to be registered as commercial.” He added that anyone who registers Uber cars as personal vehicles is “making a false statement on the report of sale, knowingly.”   and again:  http://qz.com/365854/a-coverage-dispute-between-uber-lyft-and-insurers-leaves-drivers-exposed/   But insurers are taking a dim view of this accommodation, designed essentially to allow drivers with personal insurance policies to use their cars for ride-sharing services. Some say they will cancel drivers’ personal insurance policies if they find out they are driving passengers for hire."
perth,33ii2i,senectus,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:39:51 2015 UTC,"Pretty lucky the DMV is no authority on Australian licensing and insurance then isn't it.  There are already industries in Australia where private vehicles are used for commercial activity and its accepted. The department of transport states you may be in breach of the ctpi if you are not registered as business vehicle and have an accident. But doesn't indicate what may means.   Nowhere in any of this documentation is invalidation of the insurance. The closest insurers come is indicating that while using the vehicle as a taxi you're not insured. If the contract is not invalidated by using the vehicle as a taxi at all then it should hold while the vehicle is not being used as a taxi.  Other conditions exclude your insurance while they occur, but do not invalidate your insurance at other times, why would taxi work be different when there's no indication so?"
perth,33ii2i,atsugnam,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:50:10 2015 UTC,"you do realize the same procedure is done in Australia and probably most other countries.. and that document i linked to specifically says if you lie to them when they ask you these questions you're up shit creek without a paddle...  All i'm saying is, the situation is not so cut and dry. These drivers may be in for a world of hurt..."
perth,33ii2i,senectus,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:58:32 2015 UTC,"No, the same procedure is not done in Australia. As stated, there are already circumstances in Australia where a privately licensed car is used for commercial operation and its accepted that the corp insurance covers while working and private while not - eg pizza delivery and the accepted use of vehicles for work tax deductions (which don't require business licensing or insurance either)  There is also no requirement to disclose that a vehicle has been used as a taxi to get insurance for it, only if the vehicle was being used as a taxi when a claim is made. The paperwork you linked also indicates you're not insured when the vehicle is used as a taxi, not that your insurance is canceled if you use the vehicle as a taxi.  You're making leaps that because a case in another country (with very distinct licensing requirements) had one result, the same result would happen here. That's a false equivalence. We won't know until an insurance company handles a claim and there is dispute over that claim because of the vehicles use as an uber car. The important take home factors are: Uber has the driver covered while working, the driver has private insurance for while not working, no one in Australia has indicated that there would be any invalidation of insurance while the vehicle is used for private travel."
perth,33ii2i,atsugnam,2,Wed Apr 29 23:43:22 2015 UTC,Wife was looking at becoming an Uber driver so I did a little research into it.    General vibe is that the business model relies on sucking in new drivers who last a few months or a year and then drop out because they cant make any money out of it.   Once you take out the costs the hourly rate is terrible.
perth,33ii2i,aussielander,9,Thu Apr 23 00:29:48 2015 UTC,a friend has been doing it since it launched and working friday night and saturday night alone he can clear $600 after expenses.   you are also covered by a $25 minimum per hour by uber if it is not busy enough for you to get fairs..
perth,33ii2i,spacexj,6,Thu Apr 23 02:44:58 2015 UTC,"As much as Uber makes you want to think this is a fulltime thing, it's not. Uber was never created to be a full time employer of taxi drivers, it was for people who had some spare time and a decent car to ferry people around for money.  The issue is, to comply with laws in other countries, they have to ensure their drivers have the correct licensing, insurance, etc. Therefore, the costs increase and it becomes more difficult to commit to doing this 'part time'.  I don't even see how Uber's business model is going to succeed here, unless some laws are changed significantly. The government, with a stroke of a pen (ie. reduce taxi plate costs significantly) can reduce Ubers efficacy almost overnight. The only way Uber will prosper in the future is by having changes in legislation that allows them to operate how they want to operate, or to buy up taxi companies/plates/SCV companies.  If I was an Uber driver right now, I'd make money while the sun is shining."

perth,33foji,doggie015,2,Wed Apr 22 06:03:32 2015 UTC,What is Uber exactly? I understand its a sort of Taxi service but how exactly does it work?
perth,33foji,bassplayer02,6,Wed Apr 22 14:25:42 2015 UTC,"OK, so when I was out of work last year, I applied to be an Uber driver but never took the next step as I felt I wasn't able to get up to the standards they wanted. So I learnt all about what Uber does.  First off, you download the Uber app on your smartphone. And then you sign up. When you need to get a taxi, you open the app and type in your location and it sends a notification to the driver the closest to you in your area. It display the driver's photo and ratings and you can choose which driver you want to come get you. That driver gets a notification that they have selected you and have a set amount of time to respond before the app cancels the request for them. If they successfully take the job, they'll pick you up in their car as quickly as they can and drive you to wherever you need to go.  Uber says that customers like to have free water and mints on hand so from what I've heard, most cars actually follow through with this promise and have free bottles of water and mint for customers. Uber has a rating system to make sure you get the best possible service and if a driver falls below a certain rating (I think it's either 3 or 4 stars), they get locked out of the app and pretty much end up being fired for incompetence. Uber wants the cars of the people it employs to be spotlessly clean and this was the part I had trouble with because my car is generally an enormous mess and I find it hard to maintain keeping it tidy.   Getting a ride with Uber is entirely cashless. You pay with credit or debit card through the app at the end after the fare has been calculated and the driver's wages are all transferred electronically through another Uber app once a week. You CAN tip Uber drivers if you think they're top blokes but Uber had a big policy against tipping drivers as they prefer to not use any cash at all so they instruct all drivers to decline tips. If the customer is being pushy or insists on it, they're fine with you taking the money then.   Ahh, sorry for the wall of text but I was seriously considering becoming an Uber driver last year so I looked into it a bit in-depth."

When it arrives you hop in, go to your destination, hop out.  Payment is done via the app and you are shown the receipt on your phone (Which is also emailed to you and includes the cost, the car and GPS track of the trip) and told to rate the experience."

Uber is great in the inner suburbs, away from large concentrations of taxis on main arterial routes. It is, however, utterly shithouse in the city and northbridge where i can fall over 6 taxis immediately... or wait 10 minutes for the uber driver who picks up my fare to navigate to me.  My concern is if it severely impacts the taxi industry, what will happen to the large volume of peak period cabs that are essentially required to ferry people out of the CBD on the weekend. What if I need to get from some weird location, say, Atwell to Scarbourough at 3am on a Tuesday night, which is something that I can do farily easily with a taxi service. I don't think Uber will be able to approach the volume of cars on the road that facilitates these things, and the part time nature of it could conceivably lead to simply not being able to get from one place to another using Uber.   Hopefully it spurs the taxi industry to improve a bit."

I think there is about a 4 lane roundabout near Park Lane that has no lane markings, sounds hairy, but easy enough to get across and other drivers will give space if you are indicating, rather than agro.   Up near Herts people will look out for other drivers and do a lot of headlight flashing to show you that they are giving way contrary to road rules. M25 can become a temporary carpark at certain times which can be annoying, have a magazine on hand.  There is a love for mini-roundabouts in certain areas.  These are a small painted circle instead of a proper roundabout. If you want to see one in Perth, there's one next to the Kardinya Tavern.

Third were collisions with stationary objects (17.7 per cent), again higher than the national average (14.5 per cent).   So the breakdown of crashes says that 25% of WA crashes are carpark vs 22% average nationally (mean? median? It makes a difference).  This doesn't actually mean we are worse at parking than everywhere else. What it says we are worse at parking vs every other car related action we do.

The system consisted of only three lines, the Armadale, Fremantle and Midland lines which provided a relatively uncomfortable and out of date service and, as a result, attracted minimal patronage. The Fremantle line was also shared by freight rail traffic, limiting service efficiency (University of Melbourne, 2010).    You're not totally wrong in that the line wasn't running. It was a huge mistake to close that line, and of course it was subsequently re-opened.  If nothing else, corridors should've been reserved for future rail. It was extremely short-sighted not to."

I've heard different estimates for how many workers are needed for the commissioning phase of mining versus normal production but it would seem to be a ratio of no greater than 3/1. So as the investment phase ends there's a lot more mining construction workers looking for a dwindling number of jobs.

Most if its taxis are independently operated. It already has competition, though that competition is also regulated.  Nothing in any Uber thread or statement I have ever seen indicates that deregulation of the taxi industry as an absolute is a good thing long term for anyone but Uber. Certainly reform is necessary, but there are good reasons for a regulated taxi industry, not least of which is equality of access.  Honestly I don't care that taxi drivers don't want to drive your drunk ass out to where you live on a Friday night, that's not a problem Uber will solve."

They've existed in a state regulated system for decades and they've had to pay ridiculously high amounts of money for taxi plate registration (something like $250,000). The entire system will probably end up being deregulated and unless the government does a buyback scheme for plate owners, some owners will be crippled by massive debt because their plates will end up being worthless. Those who lease plates would be able to adapt to the market better I think, even becoming Uber drivers themselves."

I can get a maxi taxi, I can get a ride to an unprofitable drop zone. I can be sure that the cab will be maintained and have a boot big enough to hold luggage.

I'm not getting the knives out for traditional local cabbies as individuals and sole traders. I'm sure there's some great ones; and the figure of the $250K+ licence is bloody ludicrous in terms of the debt hanging over their heads.

These points should be given more emphasis in the media coverage and should certainly be factored into whatever Govt action.  Fair enough we should look after the 'little guy' as a customer ... but then, the market is the big ugly guy that demands all the attention and stomps his feet. The little guy, or person with a disability doesn't shape the market which drives the largest portion of the income. Maybe there will always be a place for the properly, officially vetted and plated Cabbies and vehicles; but I think the model and costing for their acheivement really needs revision. I'd even put out the idea of Govt subsidies for plated operators?  Calling the market stupid and selfish is a little naive. I don't believe empathy or benevolence is ever really a factor in herd-mentality market forces and economics.  But regardless, you've made me think the issue through more. I'm not a Uber fan-boy especially, but do see why they're proving popular.   To me cost isn't even the biggest issue (I rarely catch cabs these days; maybe a max of once or twice every 2 years) it's more the consistency of service and availability that strikes me as the biggest point. If a niche operator model takes care of one need (pissheads ex-Northbridge @ 3am), and another operator model is subsidised but vetted and licensed to take care of another need (Gary w/ his Guide Dog ex-Coolbinia, weekday @ Midday); so be it.  I think there's room for co-existence, but the existing 'defined' or 'regulated' industry needs a bloody good shake up.   Maybe it's more re-regulation than de-regulation that's required."

The government doesn't really want free market cabs either, they like their quarter of a million per licence per year. If they didn't they'd have fixed it years ago. Qq We don't need Uber, what we need is a market where the people who actually drive the cabs don't end up so far behind the eight ball that they have to avoid unprofitable fairs and screw people over to make a living.  We need better and safer public transport, particularly on a Friday  Saturday night so that we can get people the fuck out of northbridge quickly and safely. This is a much better choice for women otherwise traveling alone than GPS.  We won't get that though, and Uber won't get what it wants either, we'll end up in some weird limbo where no one wins."

perth,33bpx9,spacexj,8,Tue Apr 21 05:44:53 2015 UTC,I think today is the only time I ever enjoyed reading the comments on a Perthnow article. I think a hatred of Swan Taxi's unifies the people of Perth like nothing else.
perth,33bpx9,Skeetzor,12,Tue Apr 21 20:14:05 2015 UTC,"I'm really impressed with uber. Used them twice and was overall a better experience than a taxi.  Came from the airport to my house last night via a taxi. $53 for 21km's in a grotty old falcon. Went to north Perth this morning, $51 for 34km's in a new Holden cruze. No comparison, hopefully this will give the taxi industry a kick up the arse."
perth,33bpx9,tw33kz0r,10,Tue Apr 21 06:12:50 2015 UTC,Perth taxis are the worst. Live too far away and the buses aren't running any more? Sleep on the street or walk home because taxis will just refuse to drive you home.  I had to throw an obscene amount of cash just to get a lift home from subi when it was pissing down and half a dozen refused me because they said it was too far. What a shitty service
perth,33bpx9,Skeetzor,3,Tue Apr 21 09:32:22 2015 UTC,"I don't understand taxi drivers. I used to live in the Northern suburbs and always got the same treatment with the ""that's too far"" story, now I live 3km away from the city and I get the ""it's too short"" story. I'll never use a taxi again after using uber."
perth,33bpx9,djskein,3,Tue Apr 21 11:01:57 2015 UTC,agreed. living where i do it's nearly impossible getting a taxi to pick me up or drop me home from the city.
perth,33bpx9,moustachaaa,25,Tue Apr 21 15:40:32 2015 UTC,fuck off taxi drivers

perth,33bpx9,muchape,8,Tue Apr 21 16:22:32 2015 UTC,So many Uber drivers are ex-Swan drivers. Obviously the company is doing it right.
perth,33bpx9,Maurice_M0ss,3,Tue Apr 21 05:46:03 2015 UTC,Kinda tells you where the problems in the taxi indistry are..
perth,33bpx9,phatnig,25,Tue Apr 21 06:48:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Swan Taxis are a joke of a company. I caught an uber from my local a few months back and the taxi driver who refused to take me home because it was ""too short of a trip"" got out of his car and started taking photos and harassing the uber driver.   The uber driver just laughed at this swan bloke who could barely speak English and said ""he's allowed to pick up his 'mate' so fuck off"". He apologized for the situation and $9 and a 8 minute drive later I was home.   If Swan didn't want to refuse every fuck for being out in the sticks or because they won't get anyone for the journey back its their own fault they're falling apart and losing money.   /end rant"
perth,33bpx9,redheasidence,3,Tue Apr 21 07:32:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am never using a taxi again."
perth,33bpx9,macgyverrda,1 point,Tue Apr 21 08:55:50 2015 UTC,"$9? Fark, you'd pay at least $20 with Swan Taxis for the same round trip.  I do see how much value you get with Uber. My older brother was getting pissed at some drum and bass thing at Villa and decided to get an Uber driver to drive him back to my place instead of a taxi like normal. We live about 10 minutes from the city and the trip usually costs me around $20-25 whenever I get a taxi (which has only been a once or twice so far). It cost my brother only $14 for the whole thing.   I'm definitely taking Uber next time I need a taxi if it's less than $15 to get from here to the city. Bargain, Swan Taxi need to realize they fucked up bad here."

perth,33bpx9,duroc_,4,Tue Apr 21 08:51:12 2015 UTC,I would never let my wife travel alone in a taxi something needs to change.
perth,33bpx9,Super_Queef,6,Tue Apr 21 14:13:51 2015 UTC,"The taxi people have had complete monopoly since forever and they abused the fuck out of it.   If they made a uber style app, let people review drivers and reduced prices slightly (for using the app) then there is no way Uber would have been able to compete with the taxi people.  It's not too late for them to do this stuff.. Uber is awesome but the majority of people are still catching taxis and if they make a decent app, give me decent drivers and a fair price I will catch taxis as well."

perth,33bpx9,heavyfriends,4,Wed Apr 22 00:27:12 2015 UTC,"Work in the city and after Friday drinks I usually get a taxi home. It cost around 40 to 55 bucks dependong on the time.  Recently ive had aweful drivers would talk on the phone, dont change lanes when i tell them or still some racist crap or hit on me. I've only used uber around 4 time but they were all amazing!

perth,33bpx9,fletch44,4,Tue Apr 21 09:36:33 2015 UTC,"When Swan Taxis get their act together and offer half of the dependability that I have seen from Uber so far, then I will consider changing back. It's absolutely ridiculous that they think that arriving 20 minutes or more past a booking is acceptable.  I can forgive it once or twice, but it's as though they think 'be here by 1:30pm' means 'leave by 1:30pm'. And then they still have the nerve to charge me extra because ""it's a booking""! Fuck that.  TL;DR - Fuck everything about Swan Taxis."
perth,33bpx9,MangoPip,2,Tue Apr 21 11:42:49 2015 UTC,"That explains why there were car horns outside my window for two solid hours. Good work taxi drivers, after todays juvenile hissy fit you have one less customer a week."
perth,33bpx9,MangoPip,2,Tue Apr 21 13:33:40 2015 UTC,Has anybody arranged an Uber pickup at either Airport?  I was just wondering if the taxis claim the airports as their territory and whether it causes a few problems in trying to organise a pickup location ?
perth,33bpx9,girigiri,8,Tue Apr 21 08:50:47 2015 UTC,The taxis don't know what cars are ubers and what ones are people picking friends up from the airport.

My parents had a friend accused of rape, he didn't rape her, he got drunk and passed out in a bed at a party, she went into the room, came out an hour later claiming rape.  He was unconscious the whole time.  This is her pattern, she accuses rape, gets the conviction, then goes after them in a civil case.  He was wealthy and recently divorced.  The police questioned him for 14 hours, whilst he was hungover etc.  The single line that got them the conviction was ""Alright, maybe I miraculously woke up up for 15 minutes even though I was passed out and raped her, yeah, sure.""  That's what got them the conviction, it removed reasonable doubt, suddenly there was a very real circumstance that he could have raped her.  He didn't for the record, but he still got 10 years for it.  If you're dealing with the cops, get a lawyer and shut the fuck up.  Not doing that is just plain fucking stupid."

perth,33aaqf,showmanic,2,Tue Apr 21 02:44:48 2015 UTC,"There's not much between them, the free browser plugins work by using P2P, when a user accesses certain domains that are known to use geo-blocking, the Hola application redirects the request to other hola users in non-blocked areas, thereby circumventing the blocking.  These P2P VPN's turns your connection into an exit node which allows people to use your internet connection and potentially access illegal material also they can inject ads on web pages which could be spyware.  Basically it's slower and less secure."

The way it works is that you get access to an index, (I use althub) to download the .nzb file (equivalent to a .torrent file), then open the nzb in a program like SABnzbd (equivalent to qBittorrent/utorrent/etc.) which you configure with your usenet access.  Shows are usually up in 720p about 20-40 minutes after they finish airing, and the download will max your internet connection.  It works similar to direct downloading, an you can enable SSL to give you your privacy."

It works OK but some things are a bit disappointing.  Eg the windows app always shows all servers offline.  Connections still seem to work OK but it's a bit slow.  There's a phone book file for pptp / l2theotherone etc connections which works better.  Tried downloading some material while I was in Bulgaria (apparently) and it was quite slow.  Also the Android setup involves downloading and importing an ovpn file for every server.  I have not done this yet. App ""coming soon"".  They have DNS servers but no port forwarding.  Also only 2 devices cf 5 for a lot of the others.  I am still reasonably happy with the service at the price I paid for it.  I imagine if they are giving away their services like this that they will not be doing major upgrades or anything.  TL/DR NordVPN cheap deal available but you get what you pay for."

perth,33aaqf,itchyballz,0,Mon Apr 20 23:53:50 2015 UTC,"It's a completely different service.  A seedbox is a dedicated machine that torrents for you, you're paying for the hosting + the Internet service it uses which is very fast & usually unlimited. Not to mention you're getting usually 10-50mbps upload which you can't get for less than several thousand $$$ per month in Australia. People will usually also use a VPN with a seedbox,  but otherwise it's either one or the other. For what you're getting though it can be considerably cheaper than the alternatives if you have a propper need for it."
perth,33aaqf,itchyballz,5,Tue Apr 21 00:07:16 2015 UTC,"I know very well what a seedbox is, but thanks anyway.   It's a completely different service.    Ahh, so you're comparing apples with oranges then? A VPN will always most certainly be cheaper for the average user. A seedbox might be useful if you're releasing new content, trying to ultra seed torrents, but if you just want to grab 10-30 Linux ISO's a week then a VPN will perfectly suit the needs of most. Even if you want to download 24/7 and budget is your main concern, a VPN will suffice for the average person."

They limited in number for each year and were popular then and I imagine still are.  Basically it was prep work and research. Where you get conflicting ""official"" information, ask around others who may have gone through the process more recently than I have.  Once you're over there you have to register for a Social Security Number (mighn't be the exact term for it, my memory is fading) You really need a reliable postal address there in order to have this processed. My mate and I winged it at the time through some trick of forwarding from the Hostel to a relative of his in the US.   But as I said, don't listen to me too to much.  I'm sure the bureaucratic visa paperwork & process hasn't streamlined that much in the last 15 years, but there's probably some feedback from Aussies that have done it more recently if you ask around here or other more relevant subs.

St John of God won't be interested, with their own facility next door, but surely Healthscope or Ramsay would be better than the current mob of halfwits.

Main two reasons are because they don't have the training how to deal with a violent patient and sending them away makes the stats for the hospital look like security are doing a good job and it makes the stats for the other hospitals look like they are getting worse.

It's slightly further (~12500nm vs ~12000), but could be done with fewer stops. Doing that with Emirates in July or November (any time after May) would give you the option of a pair of A380 sectors to get there. Whilst Qantas' A380 is arguably better in economy than the EK equivalent, you would have to put up with a domestic Australian sector at the start (not sooo bad) and a domestic US sector at the end (awful, IME) to go QF.  Disclaimer - I've never done it that way (because I've always been stopping for a while in Europe or west coast USA before NY), but I reckon I'd go for that option if I were going straight there and the timings worked at DXB."

I guess you could pull a PER-SIN-BOM-DXB-IST-LHR-KEF-YQX-JFK if you're super-keen on minimising sector lengths ;)  Emirates also have internet connectivity on their A380s, whereas QF's strategy is that they'd rather spend on IFE and service quality etc."

Cathay uses 777-300s on that route (they don't have any A380s) but they're in 9-abreast config (3-3-3) IIRC, which is OK. Going that way is actually also the shortest distance, by a tiny bit."

The weather is summery still at that time of the year but without it been too overbearing, so we walked around a lot. If I was to pick between July or November, pick July if you prefer warmer weather and November if you like cooler weather - but be mindful July will have more outdoor activites going on.  Hotels aren't that viable solo especially with the current, brutal exchange rate, so I can't help you there - My friend and I stayed at Yotel on 10th and 42nd though and I couldn't recommend that more - it was an awesome setup there and very central but not ridiculously so.  Flights? I went PER-SYD-LAX-YUL (Montreal), which was a brutal, but not that bad 35 hour trek... LAX really, really sucks - Some of the terminals have not had any upgrades since the 90s and it shows! Sadly the SYD-LAX was a Virgin codeshare with Delta, and it was not that great, though at least their 777 seating is 9 abreast and not 10. Virgin Australia is great though, albeit I experienced a free upgrade to premium economy on the way home so I had very little to complain about, and I'd pay the extra to do that on the next trip (albeit this is mostly due to me been a fat guy who barely fits in an economy seat, so 15hrs like that is not an option).  I'll mirror the opinions on here that North American domestic carriers are overpriced and generally suck - the only one that was even remotely decent to me was Virgin America, but they have a pretty limited network."

perth,33881h,crosstherubicon,2,Tue Apr 21 08:18:47 2015 UTC,"AirBnB. Pretty much a must in NYC. Significantly cheaper and nicer places than you'll find through apartment hire places, hotels, whatever. Start looking and contacting hosts now.   Accommodation wise I would stay on Manhattan if at all possible. Downtown/Midtown are obviously the easiest in terms of getting places but can be more expensive. The Upper West and Upper East (the upper east is fine as an area until you get more towards spanish harlem/above maybe 110th street) can give you a few cheaper options without sacrificing much in the way of access. The major subway lines run 24/7 so don't worry too much about that. Brooklyn can provide a much cheaper option and is significantly quieter. However, I would not look too far from Dumbo, maybe Fort Greene areas. You need to be within a minimum 10 minutes walk of a 2/3, A/C, N/Q/R train to have reasonable access to the whole of Manhattan. Do not stay in Williamsburg or surrounds it is too fucking hard to get anywhere.   Time wise, I would personally go July. November is coming into peak season (although it isn't quite there) tourist wise and bear in mind you are going to the busiest city in the fucking planet. That said, New York in summer is MUGGY. It's not 'hot' compared to here but by god is it humid.  Flights... I've gone pretty much every which way and they're all fucking shit. If you go Virgin (usually the cheapest), make sure that you're on an actual Virgin plane and NOT a Delta codeshare for the Syd/Mel/Bris-LAX flight. This is easily done. Emirates/Etihad are a good option - try and grab the A380 with Emirates as they do pack slightly more seats into their 777s than Etihad. Cathay via Hong Kong is another (often very cheap) option, but bear in mind you're signing up for 16 hours in a box HKG->NYC. It's doable but pretty gnarly. Or, if you have money to burn, the daily Air Canada flight out of Sydney is almost never full. Air NZ also an option if a sale is on.

It will be much cheaper in November, I'd highly recommend going then over July. July is when it will be incredibly busy and expensive.  Etihad was very very cheap but for a reason.

On top of that, with young people now having their hand forced into taking up private health cover, it'll take some of the sting out of the government having to pay medical expenses for this new generation of smokers.

perth,336uht,photowest,1 point,Mon Apr 20 08:03:46 2015 UTC,"Depends on the software you're using.  Because you're probably using PS your best option is to open the file in ACR or Lightroom and use the HSL sliders.  Use the cross hairs to target the area with the colour you want to saturate and drag right.  If you're using DxO then start with the Vibrancy and Sautration Tool, and then try the HSL sliders in the Advanced Tools - Light and Color section.  You probably want to push the magentas and reds in the saturation.  If you're using Paintshop Pro then you can use the Adjust - Hue and Saturation tools.  Note: If you're pirating software like PS I have no problems with it.  However you should look into PaintShop Pro X7 or X6.  There was a daily deal on PSPro X6 a while back (on Amazon) where it was selling for $20.00.  It does RAW editing and is super capable for the home user.  Purchasing moderately priced software helps put pressure on Adobe to bring their prices down, and help their competition become more competitive, meaning everyone's software improves. It also tells providers that if they don't overcharge people will make purchases they wouldn't otherwise."

Fresh garlic is amazing and you get more bang for your buck if you grow a crop of garlic since it's quite expensive to buy. It also stores well.   If you do this then buy some of the locally grown stuff.

START THE CAR!"" - Honestly - 8 hot pink lavenders for $6 each - the same size were $18 at Bunnings and Waldecks....  If you're SOR there's a person in Leeming who also sells really interesting and unusual plants:  http://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/leeming/plants/unusual-exotic-fruit-trees-and-plants/1075177910  Custard apples, betel leaf, durians, coffee etc etc :) Whole stack of dwarf fruiting trees too...."

It's this sort of ""bloody dpaw smoking out my white-picket-fence neighbourhood, fuckn bastards"" attitude that leads to campaigns against prescribed burning which, in turn, leads to dangerous accumulation of fuel, and then disastrous fires in summer.

perth,331ary,notherme,1 point,Sun Apr 19 05:30:39 2015 UTC,They used to have a long stage along the back wall with 3 cat walks jutting out so you could sit around them. Those catwalks are gone so just the one long stage. You need to get there early to get one of the 20 or so seats that are close. Though they do have the strippers come around and talk to the people sitting up the back to get them to buy lap dances. Those girls all look like little girls that got into the fancy dress cupboard.
perth,331ary,Algebrace,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:15:37 2015 UTC,Well can't exactly click those due to being on the ship's internet. You know how it is...
perth,331ary,Algebrace,3,Sun Apr 19 23:56:53 2015 UTC,"Ok so ill give a quick synopsis... um... as someone who has never been in one i have no idea what im looking at here though.   Basically all of them are relatively close to each other (theres 3) with 2 being within 1 block and third quite a bit further which is the Dollhouse one (2km ish).  Looking for reviews i found these on Yelp:  Xotica - 4 stars but the above bar is kind of trashy apparently while the downstairs one is quite good. Quoting a reviewer:   Admission is $10 and drinks are  all around nighclub prices - think $9 for spirit mixers or $8 for beers (bottled only). The tipping dollars are $20 for 19 and only tippers are allowed in the seating area - cheapskates have to stand behind the rail. The girls come out roughly on the half hour and play the room for around 20 minutes. They start out with two girls but as the place fills up they come out 5 at a time. Touching is forbidden and tips are expected but if you are decent you will get boobs in your face and plenty of laptime. All the girls do private lapdances in the downstairs area. They strip fully and, again, the quality of the experience depends on how comfortable the girl is with the patron. Touching is (strictly speaking) forbidden but most girls won't mind a gentle arm around the shoulders or a hug and peck on the cheek afterwards. When you get to know them a bit better the contact becomes more frequent. Costs are $50 for three songs or $100 for 15 minutes.    Voodoo Lounge on the other hand have a 2-3 star rating on 2 different sites with mixed reviews from 0.5 stars - 5  Dollhouse has nothing except a yellow pages ad which is legit... i suppose? However its website looks the most professional out of the 3 so take from that what you will.   Hopefully that helped"

In the end, right or not, you're the one who ended up picking up the poo. Pretty sure that could have been avoided if you'd used a little more tact, but hey people should know better, why should you have to coddle people when you were the one who was right??

Rather than looking at it like you having to compromise, give in or coddling them, maybe look at it like ""I'll just treat this obvious idiot like the sensitive little child they are for the 2 minutes it'll require, then they will do what I want.""  To oversimplify, it's a bit like ""I want this thing to happen, but because I'm in the right and have done nothing wrong I'm not willing to do anything differently because I shouldn't have to, so I'll stand my ground instead then get angry when I didn't get the thing I wanted"" As if standing your ground when arguing with idiots is far more important than actually getting what you set out to get?"

perth,32vzxz,davi5678,20,Sun Apr 19 13:39:02 2015 UTC,"So when you pay the GST on anything, that money is collected by the federal government.  That money pool is then divvied up among the states using a formula involving state income, need, and chicken bones, among other values.  So what it's saying is that when anyone in WA pays a dollar in GST, for this year we're only getting 38 cents back. The other 62 cents are going to the other states, like the NT and Tasmania who don't have strong revenue streams like farming and mining like we do.  Why do we do this? We're a federation, and we're built on being a unified nation; a rising tide raises all ships. It smooths things out, equalises standards of living, and doesn't punish an australian citizen for not living in a place with money.  It also means we don't have to spend money collecting the tax revenue ourselves, and the simplified tax of the GST improves money collection as well.  It's kinda dumb that it's so low, though. It got low because up until till recently we didn't need it - we had huge iron ore money coming in. That's been slashed really quickly, though, and the GST calculation doesn't react that fast.  If we have to take out a loan (not quite how it works, but essentially) to pay the bill for the GST to other states, then I think that defeats the point of the whole exercise.  There's a certain amount of ""if we give them money then there's less for us"" from the other states, too, and there's accusations of other states managing their economy around have 140% GST income as well.  The federal government thinks we should just privatise and deregulate everything and that'll magically solve all our money problems forever, but that's another argument."
perth,32vzxz,ellji,8,Fri Apr 17 04:28:49 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem is that the GST allocations are calculated using a 3-year moving average for the price of Iron Ore.

You start by saying each state should have the same capacity to deliver an Australian standard of living and every citizen in Australia should get an equal share of the money. This immediately means you would redistribute to states like NSW that have the highest populations. But, you also have to take into account the costs associated with WA’s sparse population etc. So you would give a bit more to WA people. In the past, WA has benefitted from this system at the expense of the other states. But now, because WA has been temporarily so rich, it would just be upper class welfare, so it has shifted back toward low income earners. Later it can be expected to swing back. The Commonwealth Grants Commission works all this out in a very detailed way and you can read their reports. Just because WA’s finances have been squandered during the boom is not the fault of the HFE system per se."

Moreover, WA’s HFE grants continued increasing to their peak in the GFC era: from 2000-2004 WA’s share was always above 96%, then from 2004-2007 WA’s share was above 100%, and only from 2008 has our share fallen below 90%, heading to 30%.

perth,32vzxz,GreyGreenBrownOakova,2,Fri Apr 17 12:00:07 2015 UTC,"I’m in a generous mood so I’ll answer your questions and add extra data. I’ve put in quite a bit of effort – not sure why you couldn’t be polite enough to look up the numbers yourself. Hopefully the table will render clearly:    Financial year WA state taxes HFE tax payments State + HFE Subtotal Royalties (FYI) Total    Pre-GST 1999-2000 $3.4b $2.8b $6.2b $777m ~$7.0b   Post-GST 2000-2001 $2.9b $3.2b $6.1b $1136m ~$7.2b   Difference with GST –$500m +$400m –2% +46% +4%    With GST, WA was merely 2% worse off in terms of taxes while being 46% better off in royalties. On rounded figures, that’s 4% better off.  On your next point, if no other state has had WA’s level of per capita mining boom, then probably no other state has received less than 40¢ in the dollar either.  Has WA ever got 3 times as much? Well, it was the neediness of WA that got this thing started. There is an unbroken line of payments going back to 1910, when WA was the first only state to be benefitting. It was getting £425k a year. So WA had the head start in taking other states’ money. Now it wants to complain. Currently NT is the only one getting several times more than what it puts in."

It's been 115 years since Federation.    46% better off in royalties.   Royalties have nothing to do with the GST. The State owns mineral rights, always has. Likewise, Barnet's shitty budget spending  record is also irrelevant, we would still be getting ripped off on the GST share if he brought in surpluses every year.   probably no other state has received less than 40¢ in the dollar either.   No probably about it. No other state has even come close.   There is an unbroken line of payments going back to 1910,   Federal grant for a specific purpose: ""One of the inducements held out to Western Australians to join the new federation was the promise of a federally funded railway line linking Western Australia with the rest of the continent.""

perth,32vzxz,GreyGreenBrownOakova,3,Fri Apr 17 13:51:24 2015 UTC,"First point of call is the CGC: “The Commonwealth Grants Commission recommends how the revenues raised from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) should be distributed to the States and Territories to achieve horizontal fiscal equalisation (HFE).” The FE history at www.cgc.gov.au goes back to 1910 (which predates even the CGC itself).  I and many others know full well that royalties are not part of GST revenues, that is precisely why I noted them in the table as an extra FYI. However, they are part of the calculation of how much GST we get: royalties are the principal reason our GST has been reduced, according to the tables published by the CGC itself. It says our GST losses were:    Reductions in WA’s GST for 2014-2015 $m Reason    Mining revenue –562 Increased royalites in WA   Payroll tax –197 Above average payroll tax in WA   Stamp duty –89 Above average stamp duty in WA    It’s not particularly interesting whether any state has or hasn’t got below 40% HFE before, but since you assert it, can you please repay my courtesy by referring me to the data source as it is something I couldn’t find myself yet, other than the 0% period below.  On your last point, as far as I know the railway money was never given to WA (the multi-state railway was built by the federal government), so I don’t know why you would bring up that strawman. The payments I refer to going back to 1910 arose from the Per Capita Agreement / Surplus Revenue Act (attempting HFE before it was called HFE). As with the GST, the colonies/states had given up the collection of their major consumption taxes to the commonwealth. WA alone got a special deal per capita for 10 years – the cost of doing this was borne half by federal government and half by the states so it appears because of this the others were initially getting 0% of it back."

With GST (a federal tax/skim/fee/levy/pick-pocket or theft) it's done by forcing people who sell things or provide a service to pass on a demanded fee from the government. The government ensures these fees are charged by a do it or die ultimatum.  Whats happening now that the stolen money is going to be divided between the states based on some ideas that have a pretty shocking track-record.  On top of that there is the problem that every State makes the case they ""need"" more of it than another simply because it's a fuck ton of money they can just ""get"".

It's not hard to imagine that an accident could happen there with some unlucky driver looking at the board when some dipshit cuts across.  I think it grabs your attention too much, as its a lit up sign that switched between 2 ads at a rate of what felt like 5 seconds while contrasting so much against the surrounding environment (low warm light from the train platform). I just passed it going home and it was an ad with some dude standing in front of an almost cyan blue background, which was almost blinding and I think an ad for Avengers.

Put it on the roof and scatter some black feathers around, so it looks like the car has killed the bird.  This will scare the birds away from the ""crow killing"" car.  If you want an illegal, but nevertheless completely hippy approach, you can make a homeopathic crow spray by shooting a crow (this is illegal) and soaking it in a bucket for a few days.   Take a drop of this water, put it in a bottle and slam it up and down on a leather Book (or a seat cover) 100 times.

They avoid contacting the owner and try to maximise their earning first and foremost. That means upping rent when ever they can, not performing repairs until they are deemed needed or left until owner does them. As well as they get a cut of the rent they also have to spend some time inspecting the property. This means any unreported problems will be deemed to be your fault and there goes the security deposit.   In my eyes they are scum with no back bones. I have had issues with them for years and their their unprofecional behaviour followed me to the next realestate agent/place I tried to rent. They lied as a reference. They actually lied. I have proof.   You are literally have to go down to the office and ask politely for an interview. .....dont do what I did and prove them wrong and yourself right. They dont like being showed up. They dont like their shady buisness practices questioned and they do not like being told they are wrong. Play the nice card. Be polite and hope for the best.

perth,32smp0,Optimal_Cynicism,6,Sun Apr 26 13:35:12 2015 UTC,"My experience with Real Estate agents is that they are either incompetent or malicious. There's a good chance that your agent is screening your calls/emails on the hope that you'll give up and continue renting.  Are you calling one particular agent, or the company they work for? If you can't get their receptionist on the phone you could always go in, explain your situation (and its urgency) and hopefully they can get the agent to call back.  If you don't get a call within a day or two I'd go in again, mention again how time sensitive it is and try and get the receptionist to get you in touch with your properties managers boss. Hopefully you have better luck dealing with them.  Unfortunately getting a price reduction will mean that the agent will have to deal with the owner, who might never check emails, or be on holiday, so I wouldn't get my hopes up. You would have to either be an amazing tenant (amazing enough that the property manager will fight for you), or the property sufficiently shitty that it is unlikely that no one else will want to rent it.

perth,32tnha,Kilcarnup,3,Fri Apr 17 01:01:36 2015 UTC,He comes across very condescending. I don't really read his views at all except when stuff gets posted up here. He's not wrong but the tone/manner he conveys it is what irks me.
perth,32tnha,tenminuteslate,2,Fri Apr 17 01:11:13 2015 UTC,We already voted in favour of secession in 1933.
perth,32tnha,nahcoob,2,Fri Apr 17 10:46:09 2015 UTC,"I mainly post for the graphs. He's making a big to-do about secession talk, but that's really a non issue as far as the actual citizenry are concerned.  The share of national money is a tricky problem though (as discussed before).  Even if we had more in the past, is that really the measure?  Were we impeding Victoria and NSW's growth in the post war boom much?  I doubt it, personally.  But I don't know.  They're saying that because the average income is so high that this is all fine.  But is it?  Prices went through the roof along with it.  Things feel strangely pinched.  The population has been growing like crazy, but we're closing hospitals and generally broke.  Seems like we're complaining this time because we could actually use more.  But I dunno.  Perhaps we had a boom that was never going to last (probably for the best) and let the proceeds slip away, with the city not really benefiting as much as it should."
perth,32tnha,nahcoob,3,Fri Apr 17 01:18:58 2015 UTC,"You say closing hospitals but neglect to mention that this has been planned since pre boom with the construction of new hospitals.  Getting tired of the ""muh hospitals and education"" argument especially when you see the enormous QEII complex (which was originally meant to replace RPH), the couple new children's hospital, various projects to increase the size of smaller hospitals (Midland and Joondalup) and Fiona Stanley, which yes I know it's reputation isn't so great but the reality is a hospital of that size hasn't opened in Perth in 50-60 years, so teething problems are only expected (and probably exasperated by the incompetence of Serco and the scrutiny the whole thing is under). I don't believe any other state in Australia has built or upgraded as many hospitals as WA in the last 5 years.   Despite the sheer level of debt the state is incurring I think the proceeds of the boom have been spent on a wide variety of projects. It could have been more efficiently spent and projects could have started up earlier (albeit in many Cases they couldn't because the economy was growing so fast that skill shortages and the price of construction made things less viable to start as quick) but I think once the current crop of projects is complete the city will have so much to show for the boom (City Link alone is enough to show this off let alone the other projects). Neither side of politics can blame each other either (but we know they will anyway) as both Labor and liberal were responsible for about half each of the completed projects since the boom has begun.  Personally I think we should count ourselves lucky that Barnett didn't go the Campbell Newman route and cancel everything and sack half of the public servants as we saw in QLD after natural disasters destroyed their state budget."
perth,32tnha,aussielander,2,Fri Apr 17 06:52:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the hospital plan has been weird since the start.  Doctors tell me we're lucky to still have an RPH, never mind losing Freo.  The story still seems like an inability to change gears when those graphs start tilting upwards and it stops making sense.  Politics, same as ever I suppose.  Again though, people are saying we had all our money in the past and now we've got loads. Seems like this time at least it's a problem because actually we don't, not because of greed and self importance (although there's surely some of that mixed in too)"
perth,32tnha,spacexj,1 point,Fri Apr 17 09:17:38 2015 UTC,"Think how valuable the land that RPH and Freo (and PMH too, but they were able to do that properly) Hospital sits on is, and it makes sense why they would build enormous new hospitals elsewhere to replace them - it was just botched quite badly by both Labor and Liberal."
perth,32tnha,ezekiellake,1 point,Fri Apr 17 09:45:06 2015 UTC,"Not that I want to make this about hospitals or city planning at large,  but I don't think there's a large western city on earth that doesn't have that problem. Land value is always a factor in such decision making, of course.  But I don't think anywhere else would rank it as high as we do in the logic.  Large, centrally located facilities is where you build hospitals because you need them there.  It's how cities get built.  The more successful you are in this, the bigger the loss you'll have to wear on any piece of essential service taking up land space in the more expensive areas.  Until telelortation gets invented, we're stuck with that.  We have a lot of great valuable locations taken up by roads too.  That thought doesn't often come into it."

Once you harden the fuck up and learn to live in WA, you realise it's one of the best places to live on earth.    Bikies are criminals: they would be too busy starting meth labs to sell meth to Sydney.   Of course they are, but they are also proud and strong Westralians. You ""Yeasterners"" don't know or understand that term, but honestly if shit got real and they realised that they had to put their criminal intentions on hold for a few months to save their nation/state, they absolutely would. If for no other reason that it would be great business for them because it would mean they'd dominate various illicit substances and businesses in the new nation, and that they would effectively be going to war with the FEDERAL Government (who give them far more trouble than the WAPOL)...

All of it is possible without the ""almighty Australian Federal Government"".....   Let's not forget that in a secession scenario, between 30-55% of the Federal Government's tax income would dry up if Western Australia seceeded.... Try running a war on those kind of dollars.

A C-A license is a C license with a restriction, getting a manual license only removes that restriction. As far as I know, you won't have to go through your P's again. You're an experienced driver so they won't make you do it again. I had a C-A license for 12 months before going back to do my manual test. I was on P's at the time I got my manual licence but I still came off my P's 2 years after I got my C-A. I was not forced to serve the 2 years from when I got the manual license.

perth,32qy0w,thegrrbrr,3,Thu Apr 16 04:51:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, actually. Dedicated bus lanes allow them to bypass other traffic and run a higher service frequency with bigger busses (Do we still have those double deckers they ran while building the Mandurah Line?)"
perth,32qy0w,doggie015,4,Thu Apr 16 05:27:41 2015 UTC,That is fine but you can't build a dedicated bus lane then expect the mindset of the people to magically start using the bus. Caught a bus home from work the other week which I haven't done in years and it cost me $4.50!! to travel 15 mins down the road. Bear in mind I had to walk 20 mins to the bus stop and another 20 mins to walk home. Fairly inconvenient compared to a personal vehicle.
perth,32qy0w,thegrrbrr,2,Thu Apr 16 06:46:17 2015 UTC,"If you have to walk 20 minutes at both ends of a 15 minute journey, you are doing it wrong. There will most likely be a transfer you can make which will shorten the walk dramatically, unless you live and work on the outskirts of the city in which case why are you even using public transport anyway?"
perth,32qy0w,doggie015,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:52:51 2015 UTC,"No. I had a car in service but wasn't ready. I live and work in southern suburbs - I checked the transperth site and the connections would of taken at least another hour. It was better to walk 20 mins alongside a busy road to another route, quite funny actually because part of the route is a dedicated bus lane... still buses are only useful going from one depot to another."
perth,32qy0w,thegrrbrr,1 point,Thu Apr 16 07:02:49 2015 UTC,Have you tried checking via Google Maps?
perth,32qy0w,doggie015,2,Thu Apr 16 07:09:06 2015 UTC,The walking is fine I walk all the time. Paying $4.50 to travel 10mins up the road is a damn rip off... it is all I could think about while on the bus.
perth,32qy0w,thegrrbrr,2,Thu Apr 16 07:22:13 2015 UTC,Are you paying the straight cash fare or using a smartrider?
perth,32qy0w,doggie015,3,Thu Apr 16 07:28:38 2015 UTC,With Smartrider 15% off its $3.80... It's not a huge difference.
perth,32qy0w,aussiekinga,3,Thu Apr 16 07:37:38 2015 UTC,But you can cut it further by enabling Autoload which raises the discount to 25% so the journey is now $3.30.
perth,32qy0w,doggie015,1 point,Thu Apr 16 07:43:15 2015 UTC,"Bus bypass lanes at traffic signal (such as those on the recent GEH upgrade) are generall a good idea but bus lanes as a whole are not. Especially on freeways and highways. The person per lane per hour count is low even compared to single occupancy cars, even on some of the busier sections. The bus lane on Kwinana fwy is under-utilised in person/lane/hour counts compared ot the rest of the road in that section."
perth,32qy0w,aussiekinga,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:39:40 2015 UTC,The bus lane on the Kwinana Freeway is supplemented by the Mandurah Line so that is an exception rather than a rule.
perth,32qy0w,doggie015,0,Thu Apr 16 05:45:09 2015 UTC,"Nope.  It is the section of road that has the highest level of bus traffic on the network currently (other than those right next to bus ports), with a bus approx. every 2 minutes. And it still has a low level. If every single bus full (40 people) then you get 1200 people/lane/hour. A freeway lane at peak flow is around 1600 - 1800 vehicles/lane/hour. Average occupancy is usually around 1.3 people per car, putting it at ~2100 to ~2300 people/lane/hour  Also, based on the buses that go along there very few of them are carrying those who would be on the trains, unless you actively got off the bus and onto the train despite them heading to the same place."

perth,32qy0w,doggie015,0,Thu Apr 16 05:53:45 2015 UTC,"Mildly faster, provided that there is no wait for the train after you get off the bus.  Plus convenience of not having to get up and move from one vehicle to another.  edit: thinking about it, by the time you get off the bus and walk from the Canning bus port down to the Canning train station the bus oyu got off would be halfway to the city. Changing would not be quicker, even if timing is perfect.  edit: is that you that downvoted me doggie? or is it someone else what doesnt like facts?"
perth,32qy0w,aussiekinga,-1,Thu Apr 16 05:55:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, running the numbers you could just miss the train as you come off the bus and still get there quicker than if you stayed on that bus once you factor in the average line speed of 109 Km/h including stops (Top speed of 130 Km/h) compared to a MAXIMUM speed of 100 Km/h for the bus along the freeway which is further limited to 80 near the CBD"
perth,32qy0w,doggie015,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:20:17 2015 UTC,"You might want to recheck your maths there.  From Canning Bus port (where the bus lane starts) into the Esplanade Bus port os 6.5km.  At 80km/h that will take a bit less than 5 minutes. (lets ignore that some of that section is 100km/h)  At 110km/h it takes 3.5minutes.  thats 90 seconds difference. Even if you could instantly transport form the bus to the train (you can't, it will take 30 seconds to walk it) you still have a fairly tight window to catch a train that turns up every 15 minutes."
perth,32qy0w,aussiekinga,0,Thu Apr 16 06:26:06 2015 UTC,"Actually, in that section you have trains running every 5 minutes or so during peak hour due to services to and from Cockburn Central joining the services to and from Mandurah"

perth,32qy0w,aussiekinga,5,Thu Apr 16 05:43:13 2015 UTC,"Our landmass is 50% greater than Europe's landmass. We have the space to sprawl, so we sprawl. Because we sprawl we need new roads. We as Australian's value larger houses with backyards. Europeans do not. As such, this man's opinions of our country are redundant, and he can fuck right off."
perth,32qy0w,wasting_life,7,Thu Apr 16 06:06:48 2015 UTC,"You know he is from Columbia, not Europe right? And is currently working in New York.  As all those things we have and value - having space etc - as I said earlier, that is fine but you cannot then expect the same level of service that high density places have.  As for roads. I love roads. The fact we build roads is the thing that keeps me in a job. I do traffic system engineering. I'm in the road construction game. But I can tell you that in many cases roads are not the correct solution. Yet it is the solution we reach for first every time."
perth,32qy0w,aussiekinga,2,Thu Apr 16 06:17:10 2015 UTC,"I used the Europe references simply because he referenced London and Paris in one of his quotes.  I have just now realised after reading your latest comment that our government despises contingent value modelling, which is what I assumed a decent government would use when examining the next best place to stick the taxpayers money is, and that was what I was basing my argument on. If the stats revealed that high density living was the best thing to do, then we would do that, but we do roads instead because we value them higher.   Instead I gave our government too much credit, they despise CVM and instead they just follow a conservative path."
perth,32qy0w,wasting_life,2,Thu Apr 16 06:32:52 2015 UTC,"I honestly have no idea what sort of modelling is done for cost benefit. I have almost nothing to do with that. So if it is contingent value I couldn't tell you.  Actually, having a quick google of it they definitely do do that sort of analysis/modelling. I know it (or something similar) under the title triple bottom line. I've seen that sort of stuff done all the time.   If the stats revealed that high density living was the best thing to do, then we would do that, but we do roads instead because we value them higher.    Pretty sure that is what the stats reveal. Time after time."
perth,32qy0w,aussiekinga,3,Thu Apr 16 06:35:54 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that we, Australia, would value high density living more, and the statistics support that, yet we gloss over them and go with roads instead?"
perth,32qy0w,wasting_life,3,Thu Apr 16 06:47:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I may have misread what you wrote. I am saying, anecodatally, that I believe we as Australian value low denisty living so much that the ability to ""sell"" high density living is much much harder than the ability to ""sell' roads and a 90 minute commute.  I think Contingent valuation modelling would support this. As the preferance for high denisty is very low."
perth,32qy0w,aussiekinga,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:51:05 2015 UTC,"That is exactly what I am saying. We don't build up, we build out because that is what we want.

perth,32qy0w,wasting_life,3,Thu Apr 16 07:02:48 2015 UTC,"I think we are similar but different in our approaches.  I agree we do want we want. But I also think many people don't htink about what they want. People say they want the backyard and the space etc, but then whinge about commutes and traffic. We can build more roads to serivce the low denisty, but roads attract traffic and its a downward spiral. And at the current price of construction, we cannot meet the demand for new roads.  I don't think what he is saying is without merit. I think he is more saying ""you need to look at what you want and make sure it is what you really want, because it probably isnt.""   We need to take that step back and really think about what we want and what are the consequences of wanting that.   And that isn't for the Government to do. That is for the people to do on an individual basis.  EDIT: Either way, good chat. I learned some stuff. :)"
perth,32qy0w,aussiekinga,2,Thu Apr 16 07:09:38 2015 UTC,"yeah the three P's thing? People, Planet, Profit. If they do follow this then clearly roads must win out as the best of all three of the P's as opposed to multistory buildings.  P.S. I don't think our government follows this because of the Kakadu CVM that was undertaken a while ago that caused massive uproar because it valued not mining at $60 million better off than if they were to mine there."

Edit, also note that I dont know what the Government does. All I know is what is done at a project level that is fed back to governemnt for decisions and funding. I work with roads. we do triple bottom line. I have no idea what is done by ??? (Landgate?) when determining where to release or zone land."
perth,32qy0w,aussiekinga,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:44:15 2015 UTC,"It is mostly the Department of Planning (DoP) that deals with rezoning land. There is often political influence in the mix too, but theoretically it is up to the DoP to decide where new subdivisions should be. This typically takes place 5-10 years before any development actually occurs.  Within these zones local councils take responsibility for the type of property that is allowed to be developed (DoP will zone an area residential and the council will decide if it is R20, R60 etc). Also it is up to the local councils to rezone land for higher densities (like in South Perth) but sometimes the DoP or MRA get involved too.  I think Landgate is more involved in mapping than long term planning, but I'm not sure about that one - might have to have a look later"
perth,32qy0w,theenglishguy72,4,Thu Apr 16 09:39:57 2015 UTC,"Lol denser city living. Thats like asking perth to stop being a costal city. Almost everyone I speak to always says the same thing, they like their own little house with a garage.   I dont want one, i much rather be in a city close to everything, not needing a trip planned to the shops when I can pop down to the corner grocers. Not gonna happen in perth. Even with inner city living the backwards city that this is everything still closes in the free times I can go out and do things. Aka after 6 pm and untill midnight."
perth,32qy0w,Lord_Augastus,4,Thu Apr 16 02:26:03 2015 UTC,"we have one freeway, wow what an obsession. sure its has two names, but thats just so perth drivers dont get confused, and north and south cant seem to share anything. even then i find it a stretch to call 2 lanes south a freeway, anywhere else in the world it would be called a joke. trying to compare road systems from different cities with different populations, train systems, bus systems, cost of taxis, etc etc is just comparing apples to oranges. fuck off back to where you have 12 lane freeways criss-crossing your country and tell me again how we have a road obsession."
perth,32qy0w,obzelite2point0,4,Thu Apr 16 09:11:47 2015 UTC,"The number of freeway in a city is a bad way of looking at a road network. If you look by freeway length instead then the Kwinana/Mitchell Fwys are over 100km long, plus the Graham Farmer and decent sections of the Roe and Reid highways. That is fair bit.  Of course it clearly isn't enough to stop traffic congestion, so the previous mayor of Bogota (which is in Columbia not the United States) is suggesting alternatives to just building more roads. Bogota had a poor transport network with bad congestion but instead of building more roads, he invested in buses and bus lanes.   Maybe get your basic facts straight before commenting on something. That's what politicians have been doing and won't fix any problems"
perth,32qy0w,theenglishguy72,6,Thu Apr 16 10:12:39 2015 UTC,"""It is so weird that you in Perth continue to build new roads and new freeways when the rest of the developed world has stopped.   That isn't exactly true.   The fact that you are still building new roads, and I saw some of them being built when I arrived at Perth Airport, is old-fashioned - the thinking of 50 years ago.   That's not a new road. It's an upgrade. And what would he propose in it's place?   It doesn't matter what is built - a new freeway or a high-rise building. The question should always be: will it improve the way we live?   This is a good criteria to work by. Will it be an improvement.  I do think its a bit rich for him to come along and say ""we shouldnt be doing x, y or z."" He's been here a few days. How would he know how it actually stacks up against the ""is it an improvement"" criteria.  New roads might actually be fine, if they improve things. Such as the major imporvements that will be seen around Perth Airport when the upgrades are done."
perth,32qy0w,aussiekinga,10,Thu Apr 16 01:17:53 2015 UTC,"I think he is basing his comments on the proven theory that increasing road capacity by widening them, leads to an increase in traffic congestion. He may have chosen some poor examples to make his point but if all he sees is road projects for a growing city, and all the talk of cancelled rail/light rail projects, he is right to say we are heading down the wrong path in terms reducing congestion or increasing access to other areas."
perth,32qy0w,czechmeight,2,Thu Apr 16 03:53:47 2015 UTC,"And this?   In Bogota, we transport 50,000 people a day with our rapid bus transit - that's bigger than most subway systems in the world.   50,000 people a day in a city of 8 million isn't much of an achievement. What about the other 7,950,000 people that still need to use the roads?"
perth,32qy0w,aussiekinga,7,Thu Apr 16 07:16:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're getting at.   I doubt 50,000 people per day is bigger than many subway systems. That comment doesn't seem right at all.  edit - I found this. Maybe something got lost in translation there?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransMilenio   Daily ridership quickly reached 800,000 after the system opened. TransMilenio has since been expanded and ridership in early 2006 was 1,050,000 daily, and in 2009 was 1,400,000 daily. As of 2008, seventy-five percent of Bogotans rated the system as good or very good   second edit - I think it should have said 50,000 per HOUR."
perth,32qy0w,aussiekinga,2,Thu Apr 16 07:21:24 2015 UTC,"From the PTA 2013-14 Annual Report the Midland Line had the lowest patronage of 6.646 million boardings, or an average of 18200 per day. Mandurah line had 20.664 million boardings or an average of 56600 per day.  Gives oyu an idea of the sort of size he is talking about in relation to something we know.  EDIT: I saw your ""per hour"" edit. Done calcs. Our train system averages 7000 people per hour. Of course that is suggesting that it runs equal 24/7/365, wihch it doesnt. I expect at peak we would do 50000 per hour easily enough."
perth,32qy0w,czechmeight,3,Thu Apr 16 07:31:54 2015 UTC,"7000 per hour is 168,000 per day. 50,000 per hour in peak times (7.30am to 9am, 4pm to 5.30pm) is just under 90% of each day's train passengers. Not sure your peak hour estimate is correct.   But they obviously have a much larger population so the people they move on their rapid bus system would be relative to that population.   Again, I'm not saying this guy has all the answers, or even got his point across properly. All I know is that our one and only solution of widening the freeways and highways is not the solution to traffic congestion."
perth,32qy0w,czechmeight,1 point,Thu Apr 16 10:49:53 2015 UTC,"I think it was closer to 173000 per day, but it doesnt really matter.  I would guess a weekday would do about double the trips of a weekend day. So If we use 173k average per day we then get 1.2million per week. That would be 200k on a weekday and 100k on each weekend day. (not taking into account public holidays or special events or all sorts of things htat can throw the numbers right out)  Perth public transport is extremely peaky. I don't think it would be a stretch at all to say that more than half the movements are in the two peak times. So I guess that comes to aorund 50k per peak. Which you put as 90minutes, not an hour.  It would be at least 50% would be my guess. Needs to be 75% to reach the 50k per hour mark, based on these numbers.  And this is just the train lines that these numbers come from, not all the buses.  Just throwing numbers around with a lot of estimates but I still dont think that at our peak we aren't moving 50k people in an hour. In the end I don't know. It's all just guesswork."

I think we can all foresee what's to come in 3-5 years. A gridlocked city with three main roads serving as moving carparks during peak hours. Wanneroo Road, Mitchell Freeway and Marmion Avenue.  It's too late."
perth,32qy0w,gaspah,9,Thu Apr 16 06:43:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, because the entire population lives North of the river...  What about Tonkin Highway, Great Eastern Highway, Kwinana Freeway, Orrong Road, Stirling Highway,many others?   The thing I dislike most about this article is the way that this guy is saying we're taking the wrong direction that any cities stopped taking many years ago. However, those many cities had properly designed road and transport systems in place when they stopped building roads. Those cities like London and New York have trains that stop directly at the airport, we don't."
perth,32qy0w,aussiekinga,-2,Thu Apr 16 06:54:56 2015 UTC,"Have a look at Vancouver then. They are a city that is bigger than Perth and haven't built any new freeways in 30-40 years. Their downtown area is quite dense, but their suburbs are pretty similar to ours. There is no reason why we have to ""catch up"" with road spending. We can either choose to invest in roads or public transport. Clearly we are going for the road"
perth,32qy0w,theenglishguy72,-3,Thu Apr 16 09:53:34 2015 UTC,"Well have you ever tried driving through London or New York? It is horrible. No one in any major European city (or Vancouver/New York) is trying to fix traffic congestion. They know that if they build a new road people will stop taking the train and drive instead - pretty quickly it will be just as busy as it was before. The point of public transport is to provide a reliable, fast alternative to driving. That's what the SkyTrain in Vancouver does. Trains don't slow down when they get congested, they keep travelling like normal"

Of course, I don’t know the full circumstances of what happened in your case, and I’m not giving legal advice, but you could do worse than to point your browser at http://www.magistratescourt.wa.gov.au (no lawyers involved). I would think, for example, that you could try making a minor claim and he would be obliged to respond. It could then go in many directions depending on if, when and how he responds. For instance, he could admit fault and offer a settlement, or not admit fault but settle through mediation, or go before a magistrate, or not respond and have a default judgement imposed.

In the case of the phone check the settings for serial numbers and software versions. As well as physical data such as camera, speakers, screen, lag, maybe get a few apps that you can judge performance of the device.   Lesson 2: research. Simple learn what you can about the product you want so as to accuratly judge if its upto the quality and reality.   Lesson 3: buying from an unknown source and/or online do not trust the sellers word judge for yourself, in which case the first two lessons ebove are important.   Feel free to add to my points.

I didn't graduate quite as long ago as you, but I have been on the hunt for a job for a few months now. My connections, though apparently willing to help me as much as they can, don't seem to be able to actually offer any assistance - because they aren't in a position to affect hiring, and as a reference there are so many other people applying for any positions that come up, all with good references of their own.   It's so draining, I just feel sick all the time. I get up in the morning, and read yet another article in the AFR (or similar) about the glut of law graduates. It wasn’t this bad when I started my degree, so how can I be to blame? The writers sometimes call us entitled because we expect jobs, but I did sacrifice my standard of living and work hard for several years to demonstrate my abilities through some pretty spectacular grades. I'm not expecting to walk straight into an amazing cashed up job (though some people seem to expect that), but I would like to be able to support myself and use my skills and experience to do something meaningful with my life.  I'm used to being busy, but I'm bored out of my mind with nothing challenging to do. I can’t sleep because I haven’t done enough during the day. It’s hard to socialise because my friends are in the same boat as me (and seem to want a depressing pity party), have fled the state or even the country, or are too busy working and hanging out with new friends from their job.  You can't even start in a lower job to get experience anymore, because all the paralegal/researcher jobs now come with the rider that law graduates will not be considered for the position. I've called so many HR departments, if they bother to answer the phone or return my calls, I always manage to get them interested, but they talk to their superiors and it comes back to 'we will only hire past clerks'. That means I have to sit on my hands until clerkship time comes around, hope that I get one, then wait until it’s time to apply for a graduate position, and hope I get that as well.  If I manage to stand out enough to get hired, this will be in 2+ years’ time.  I’m sure it’s just a case of being persistent and making an opportunity happen, but fuck it’s such a draining experience."

I went back to Uni and got more quallies. Honours degree. Grad dip. Crank up the HECS debt - didn't matter, I was still moving.  And I went to EVERY industry ice breaker, every graduate getting-to-know-you, every company thingy held by the careers centre and I joined the local industry association as a student member and turned up to everything looking perky in my one pair of good shoes - I used this to do some work for free for a few people. Everntually I got a temp job through an agency at the bottom of my field, in a position I was horribly overqualified for. Didn't matter - my salary doubled overnight. Cleaning toilets sucks.

I've got two diplomas and a degree, got good very results and even industry awards.  All the graduate and junior ads end up being recruiters with no actual job or ""we want someone with 3-5 years experience"" when I go for an interview.  I managed to get some regular part time retail work 12 hours ($216) a week but I end up covering for other staff in our store due to various reasons and retail industry problems, usually giving me anywhere from another 8-16 extra hours week for which I'm grateful but of course the downside is I can only attend interviews on my free day and if an employer demands I attend an interview on a day that I'm working I automatically miss out. Meanwhile I'm teaching myself web design so that I can physically show an employer what I could do for them when they say but we need someone experienced, something I cannot do with my current admin/databases/networking specialty fields that I trained in.  Unfortunately with the wages I get it's not enough for me to move out of home or to cover the all the family house bills which is very worrying seeing that between me and my dad we have to pay all the bills in our family, and I hear there's yet again more mining layoffs which will likely affect him.

Don't stop applying for jobs, people saying you won't get a job by applying and sending resumes are maybe a bit misguided ... if a job is being advertised, the company has shelled out money to do that and so obviously they don't know anyone suited to the position else it wouldn't have been advertised.

In the last month I've discovered that almost everything I've been told about career development is wrong. Either it was always wrong, or it's since become wrong.  You have to network. Applying to jobs that are advertised publicly with no connection to the company advertising is the least effective way to get a job.  I recommend that you get yourself an ABN (it's free), work out what your most marketable skills are, set up a website, domain, twitter account, Linkedin profile and Facebook page, then call everyone you've ever met.  Trick is, it's more important to make a connection than to sell yourself. Learn what all the people in your network do and want, then slowly you'll be able to recommend people to each other and build trust. Once people trust you enough to recommend you, they'll be finding the people that actually need your skills (in order to develop their network).  At the same time, you can't stop learning. You may think you've done your studies, but it never stops. You need to find more training/certification/reading or whatever that either compliments your best skills or develops your business and social skills.

From what I've seen in the media, they appear to be full size. To me it'd make more sense to offer smaller bins, the waste is being distributed across at least two, so the amount per bin should be reduced.

The article mentions that residents will be able to use smaller bins if storage or verge space is an issue so that suggests it's possible.  I get the alternate collection patterns, I doubt many people would fill a bin of green waste weekly, so much could be (and should be) composted. Likewise with recycling, doubt many would be filling that on a weekly basis, and if they are, crush cans, compact boxes and so on."

It's possible they'll cover $5k of your damage if the other party is uninsured. At best, they'll do the legal legwork to get the other party's insurance to cover your damage in its entirety.  Failing that, you will need to get your car repaired and sue the at-fault person (and/or their insurer) for damages.  But for goodness sake - read your PDS.

If the OP is not at fault his third party insurance does not help him and his insurer does not get involved. He has to pursue the third party and there is unfortunately a reliance on that person to do the right thing.  The exception to this is if OP has an uninsured motorist extension as part of his third party cover, but this is only useable iff the other person is uninsured.

The thing that eventually got them to repair my car was serving them a court summons. Even though we were both insured by the same company, there was nothing they could do to speed the process up, I had to wait for them to lodge a claim and pay their excess.  The story: Someone did a hit and run on me the second day I had my licence. I got their rego and reported it to the police, they eventually tracked them down and handed over the other drivers details. I only had 3rd party insurance at the time so I had to send them a letter myself, my insurance company didn't want to know about it. Turns out the other driver had insurance anyway and contacted me to say she'd lodged a claim and would be paying the excess very soon.  Fast forward a few months and her dad comes knocking at my door saying he's a panel beater and could get a mate to do it, blah blah blah. I insisted that we go through his daughters insurance and do it properly and that I was waiting for her to pay the excess.  A few more months passed and I got sick of it. About 7 or 8 months had passed since the accident and I had a smashed (albeit working) headlight that was attracting police attention. I decided to go and lodge a court summons as I had exhausted all other avenues.  Within 3 days of her being served, the other driver knocks on my door and says she's going to pay the excess the next day. She also asks me to make sure that I recall the summons ASAP.    A few days later, I get a call from the insurance company. Two weeks later, my car was at the panel beater. Finally."

perth,32jquz,xyrgh,2,Tue Apr 14 13:39:16 2015 UTC,"When I worked at SGIO, depending on the circumstances, we would lodge TPPD claims only and look after our client but only when the third party was deemed absolutely at fault.  SGIO also have an 'Uninsured Motorist Extension'. This provides a limited cover (was around $6k when I worked there) for your vehicle when the third party is uninsured. It would be worth calling them just to lodge a claim (you can always withdraw the claim with zero affect on your policy), because if the third party is dragging his feet on this, he's probably uninsured, and you'll be able to claim the benefit.  My recommendation would be to call SGIO and lodge the claim, they'll have more clout ringing up the third party than your average person."
perth,32jquz,Lozzif,1 point,Wed Apr 15 02:44:14 2015 UTC,Lol. SGIO have never had $6000 UME cover. And they aboustley will not get involved in this dispute. He does not pay them for that privilege. He MIGHT get a claim lodged (as insurers cannot refuse this) but they won't do the legwork if TP is insured.
perth,32jquz,xyrgh,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:32:02 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected, it was $3000 back when I was working there. It's $6,000 in my current insurance policy (which is full comp, so I don't care).  And it depends. I used to work in total loss team and, by virtue of having less workload than the other consultants, was responsible for trying to do 'legwork' for third parties for either their UME cover or to get other third parties to cough up.  I mean, a person with a TPPD policy is still a customer. Maybe the culture there has changed, but theres a reason SGIO used to be the best car insurer in WA and why AAMI and RAC aggresively chased them for customers over the last 5 years."

perth,32jquz,natacon,2,Tue Apr 14 10:34:02 2015 UTC,So all the advice given is wrong. As the other driver is insured then your uninsured cover with SGIO is not relevant. You pay for third party and that is what they'll do to help. You need this guy to lodge a cloak. Do you know who his insurance is? Do you have his address?  If you know who his insurer is then call them and check if he's lodged a claim.   If he definitly hasn't lodged a claim to obtain a quote yourself. Send him a letter (preferably registered) advising him that he is at fault for causing the damage to your vehicle and you request full and final payment to settle you. From memory Legal Aid WA has some good templates. Give him two weeks to give you the money or lodge a claim with his insurer.   If this doesn't make him lodge a claim then you need to lodge a case in small claims court. You do have to pay for this but you would get reimbursed by his insurance company (and if they refuse raise holy hell. He is delaying things not you)  If he doesn't respond then you can apply for default judgement and he then HAS to pay you what you asked for.   Be warned that just because he lodges a claim doesn't mean you'll get fixed straight away. He still needs to pay his excess.   Source: I work in motor claims.
perth,32jquz,Lozzif,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:41:26 2015 UTC,Under third party insurance SGIO are not responsible. They are only responsible for cars you damage. You need to go to the small claims court and make out a claim with a summons. Its then up to the court to demand payment. The summons usually works but if it goes to court don't hold your breath.

You will probably need at least a couple of years experience too.  I moved into networking from a more all round admin role. I had experience in Linux and networking, among others. Education, I have a computer science degree and various certs. Some jobs ask for a degree, but there are a lot of guys better than me who don't have one.  I know it's hard because people look for experience and you can't get experience without a job.  Unfortunately, I think the CCNA level jobs will be fairly entry level, so might not pay much and may not be purely networking.  Are you doing anything IT related now? What type of work are you doing?"
perth,32kblr,s0dapop,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:38:31 2015 UTC,"A systems Admin role would be great too, I'm interested in Linux and have a bit of experience with Windows and Mac. I did start down the path of getting a Computer Systems and Networking degree (did 1 semester) but a) It would take me 6 years part time and b) I'm not really sure if I'd necessarily be in a better position after spending $20K. I would still have very little experience.  Some of the work I do is with Unix and Windows networks. The kind of stuff we do is very basic as there are step by step procedures for 80% of the work we do and we're legally obligated to follow those procedures. For example: if a server dies in the Unix system, all we do is throw in a pre-configured spare, run a few scripts to install a bit of software and that's it, it's back online. If advanced troubleshooting is required, generally we have to seek engineering assistance.   We do have some Cisco networking gear but the most we get involved in that is plugging them in and powering them up. They're generally preconfigured before its shipped to us then they do the rest of the configuration via Telnet from over east. If we do have to configure one on site, the configuration file is simply copied to it via console port, we have no idea what the config is.  What I'm hoping is that if I get CCNA plus some MCSE and possibly some Virtualisation certification (VMWare, for example), I could leverage my current experience and market my problem solving, troubleshooting and coordination skills."
perth,32kblr,s0dapop,1 point,Tue Apr 14 23:31:16 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you could start getting some experience where you are now.  Are other guys that do the work contractors or internal? I would ask for a low privilege account that you can use to log in and see how the network is going.  Getting used to what output you get from the 'show' commands will help you big time when you need to fix something, and you don't need a full privilege account for most of that.  Even if they're getting you to paste config via the console, you can figure out what the commands do.  In the real world, you try to keep things standard across sites and devices, so you'll be using a lot of standard config off templates anyway. The important thing is to know what the commands you're inputting are actually doing.  There are a lot of guys in networking out there who will be pasting config into devices and not know what they're actually doing.  Like someone below me said, try to work with the guys who do the work. If something breaks, and they fix it, speak to them about what happened and how the fixed it.  Also, if you're going into networking, please get a real understanding of the low level things like ARP, DHCP, switching etc.  We come across too many people who are in the same positions who don't really understanding these things, and if it were up to me, I'd hire someone with less experience and certs, but actually understands what's going on at that low level and is able to get up to speed quickly.  If you can, try to skip service desk roles, and get into a junior role in a higher level team. Try not to end up in an area you're not really interested in, which can happen sometimes if you're starting at a service desk level."
perth,32kblr,_cephei,4,Wed Apr 15 19:59:03 2015 UTC,"All the certs in the world won't give you the experience companies are after (even when I was hiring people for basic ISP helpdesk people without degrees were getting the position over people who did have comp sci/networking/etc degrees/certs.

From your comment there are more technical people within your company? Get chummy with them and look at seeing if maybe you can try and work with them one day a week/fortnight if your work would allow it. Any experience you can get is better than nothing. If you're happy to take a paycut to get into an entry level position that will get you where you want, look at companies that have a smallish IT team that works closely together; this will give you exposure to what you want to do and internal movements are always preferred over new hires. A sys admin role will still be difficult to get into but if you're really dedicated to this starting from a service desk role wont be the end of the world and if you pick up stuff quick you can move up easily enough."

The people who work there are pretty cool and will take their time to do your cut right (25 mins), also are pretty familiar with trendier haircuts like undercuts, fades, etc if that's your thing. Best part is after they finish they bring out a damp towel soaked in some sort of soothing aloe-vera solution? And my god, I'd pay ten bucks just for that.  Due to change in my financial situation I started going to QC in Raine Square, where you put $10 into a machine and take a ticket. Usually ten minutes wait on a walk-in tops, but more likely you get served immediately. They'll trim you up in 10-15 minutes and the quality is honestly not that bad (but it varies depending on who is doing the cutting). If you want a simple cut it's alright, but go to the aforementioned if you want something nice or complex and are willing to pay."

Having niche interests doesn't really represent the sub as a whole, and makes for more contention; much like your dark side suggestions versus what was apparently important (i.e. dating/personals) when it was last overhauled.   Meh.. if /r/perth sidebar can't be regularly updated (who has the attention span?) I think it should just err towards boring, basic local resource links like WA News sites, BoM Weather Forecasts, Transperth, Perth Gumtree blah blah etc etc.  Nothing any idiot shouldn't be able to find for themselves, but they still ask about here anyway.  I'm for the suggestion that the list of other Perth related subs be expanded by default though. It might bring some life back to them.  There may well be scope for a specific sub for your sort of links.  You should consider starting your own.  /r/DarkPerth maybe?"

Unless you have someone who actively maintains it, you don't really want too much crap that needs regular review or updating.  People are going to ask stupid questions regardless.

It also stated that the Perth restaurant was set up using money donated by a philanthropist.   I tried to find this information on their website but it doesn't seem to be in there. Perhaps they have since changed their structure?  I know they have been open a lot longer than since 2011.  I don't think that it's a very reputable source of information, but I found this:  http://wedreambusiness.org/Annalakshmi.html  A couple of years ago, my husband and I enquired about having our wedding reception there. The price we were quoted was ridiculously low and I know that there is no way they could have made a profit from that.

It's called the Gaya Restaurant, just across Il Ciao  EDIT: I highly recommend booking a table for Fri-Sun nights as we are most likely to be fully booked! Thursday night would be better for a date since it is quieter."

Mathilda Bay is also pretty good. You won't get out of either of those places with much change from two hundred if you're doing dinner with wine though.  For something a bit more basic Sidernos up near Ozzy park is good as is Sopranos in South Perth and Bela Rosa in Carlisle. All Italian, but all pretty good.  Vs burger bar in Victoria park is one of the best burgers I've ever had, but it's fairly small for a more formal date and pretty pricey for something casual, great food, not the best date.  Lots of stuff in the city too, though personally I wouldn't do a degustation unless you know your date is into that sort of thing. You can't really be a fussy eater at one of those."

It's the same novelty factor that's making american food in general really popular right now.  Also, due to red tape - they appear at events like this rather then been in a permanent location in a parking lot or on the side of the road as they do say, in the US. The costs involved in promoting the event are passed down to the owners of the food truck, resulting in the pricing we see.  People do seem to go back to the same events over and over though, evidenced by the long lines and general hype that surrounds them, even if they're known to be underwhelming (e.g. the noodle markets in which they were near double the prices of similar meals in restaurants around Perth, and the same markets were rated very poorly in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane - regardless, their was half hour-hour long waits for the first week). Until the hype settles both here and in Melbourne, Sydney, etc I don't see them becoming cheap any time soon (especially if other posts are true here that there was a half our wait for food out of every single truck - why would they lower their price with that demand?"

When a mac and cheese toastie was ready instead of waiting for a cuban to be ready they would look through the other orders to find an order for one mac and cheese and give that to them.

perth,326pqk,foader,1 point,Sat Apr 11 06:28:13 2015 UTC,"Because the traffic going north off the end of Stock Road would end up piling onto the already at-capacity Stirling Highway and make existing problems there even worse.  It'll probably be the eventually, but other works need to happen first to ease traffic flow through the Claremont area."
perth,326pqk,The_Valar,2,Sun Apr 12 01:57:40 2015 UTC,"Added to that, the northern end of Stock Rd would require some fairly significant upgrades. Probably land purchases that would not come cheap at all.  Then once the tunnel is in you would to do even more upgrades to roads in Dalkeith - probably Vincent/Adelma Rd. This would be extremely expensive to get the land to do that.  The whole idea is super cost prohibitive. I would expects costs in the billions.  Ardross/Applecross to Crawley would be a longer tunnel, but might actually be cheaper in the end due to the connections on land."

perth,326pqk,foader,5,Sat Apr 11 15:15:32 2015 UTC,"This must be the stupidest road project I have seen in a long time. I really don't understand what the state or federal governments are thinking. I get why they are building Roe 8, that has been planned for decades, but upgrading High Street to a freeway is crazy. Prior to the Abbott government, no department had ever suggested this freeway be built. There was a plan a couple of years ago to spend $100 million to remove the corner of High Street and Stirling Hwy but that is it.   Tony Abbott has invented this project out of no where and basically bribed Barnett to built it by providing 65% of the funds. However this still means the state government (who aren't in a good financial position) still have to contribute $600 million. That money could be much better spent on worthwhile transport projects that would actually reduce congestion.  The only reason this is happening is because Tony Abbott has a fundamental opposition to any form of public transport, so he is rushing through these road projects before his term runs out. There has been pretty much no consultation and it wouldn't surprise me if there are major problems when building it.  The idea that they now want to build a tunnel here is so strange. If you asked anyone from Perth ""where would be the best place to put a 2-3km road tunnel"" I bet you virtually none would say Fremantle. Just off the top of my head, putting some of Orrong Rd into a tunnel would be so much better.  I really hope people start to realise how much of a joke this is     EDIT: Well thanks everyone for downvoting me, guess I won't bother commenting next time - thought /r/perth was different, but clearly not. Everything I have said is true, until a few months ago no one had proposed upgrading High Street to a freeway before and if you were to actually read the article you would see that this has nothing to do with the other road upgrades around Perth. No one has actually replied saying why this such an amazing use of taxpayers money yet, so I don't see what your problem is"
perth,326pqk,theenglishguy72,10,Sat Apr 11 01:59:57 2015 UTC,"The plan has actually always been there ever since the metropolitan region scheme was first published in 1959,it's just been made more difficult over time (land that was acquired to link the future roe hwy through to Stirling Hwy without the need to use Stock Rd and High St was sold off by the state government a very long time ago) to complete - thus this proposal which winds a freeway grade road through using existing roads that weren't designed to ever become freeway grade.  The project as a whole is definitely beneficial (mostly northlink, e.g extending Tonkin Hwy up past Ellenbrook and ending up at Muchea/Bullsbrook effectively bypassing the over capacity Great Northern Hwy and the over capacity roads that lead to the Ellenbrook region, Roe 8 and also the planned interchange upgrades for Tonkin and Roe that will make them ALMOST entirely freeway grade). The justification to make a full freeway grade route right through to Fremantle though, let alone High St seems a bit over the top though."
perth,326pqk,nahcoob,0,Sat Apr 11 02:53:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've got no problem with the rest of the project (grade separations and Northlink) they need to happen eventually so they may as well make the most of the federal money. The section through Fremantle though seems like they are just building it because the money is there, not because it is a priority.  Also about the old plans for the Roe Hwy to join up with Stirling Hwy, they were dumped 15-20 years ago after the government decided it would be better to build a new port in Kwinana in the future rather than upgrade Fremantle to meet demand. In 20 years or so (if Perth keeps growing) they will build a new port further south, which will make the new freeway they are building now redundant."
perth,326pqk,theenglishguy72,3,Sat Apr 11 03:24:48 2015 UTC,"The Fremantle component of the money would be much better spent on improving rail access into Fremantle Port.   Each rail wagon can carry the equivalent of 2-4 semi-trailer loads away from the wharf at once, moving 20-30 wagons at a time. Then a container terminal could be built away from the residential and commercial areas of Fremantle to take advantage of the new upgraded and grade separated highways.  But expecting Barnett or Abbott to make forward thinking decisions like that is clearly asking too much..."

perth,326pqk,jophesaur,-1,Sun Apr 12 15:22:10 2015 UTC,"Technically it isn't a bribe, but it is probably the best way to explain it. The WA government weren't planning to build this road, but the federeal government convinced them to contribute $500 million by offering to fund the remaining 65%  It is more than just an incentive as the federal government knew it would be diverting money away from other projects in Perth."
perth,326pqk,theenglishguy72,1 point,Sun Apr 12 15:55:22 2015 UTC,"It is not a bribe. It is a tied grant- the Commonwealth gives money to the states because the states can't collect nearly enough revenue to meet their commitments, while the Commonwealth collects more than it needs. If they didn't, hospitals and schools would cease operating.  Under section 96 of the Constitution, the Commonwealth are allowed to add conditions to these grants, resulting in stories like this- the Commonwealth giving money to the states for a project the former desires. You are right that this does result in the Commonwealth influencing areas that constitutionally state responsibilities like education, health and roads, but it can't really be described as a bribe."
perth,326pqk,jophesaur,4,Sun Apr 12 17:33:40 2015 UTC,I don't think bypassing Freo with a tunnel is such a bad idea but I agree there are many other areas that could use the money.

There are so many other places around Perth that need improvement at the moment, just look at Canning Hwy, Orrong Road, Guildford Road etc. I don't think that spending all the state government's money on one expensive tunnel is going help at all. Maybe spend $100-200 million on a few roads so that everyone benefits. Add right turn lanes, improve intersections etc"

I suspect 'toll' is the significant factor this time, even if they are old plans in some form or other.    Abbott personally called the new Victorian Premier on the day of his election and told him not to cancel theirs (which was an election promise).  What other developed western nation's leader does that over a toll road in some city? It has a bad odor to it."
perth,326pqk,Muzorra,0,Sat Apr 11 06:31:14 2015 UTC,"I try not to get involved in the whole Abbott hate circlejerk most of the time because he has his reasons and often I can understand where he is coming from. But with transport his policy is crazy. He refuses to fund any public transport at a time when patronage is growing faster than any time in the last 60-70 years.  You just have to read quotes from his book to understand that he is fundamentally opposed to public transport:   ""In Australia’s biggest cities, public transport is generally slow, expensive, not especially reliable and still hideous drain on the public purse. Part of the problem is inefficient, overmanned, union-dominated government run train and bus systems. Mostly though, …there just aren’t enough people wanting to go from a particular place to a particular destination at a particular time to justify any vehicle larger than a car, and cars need roads"" - Tony Abbott   This is why politicians should let experts influence policy rather than over-rule everyone because he knows best. Cities and people change, he is stuck back in the 80s with his position on this."
perth,326pqk,theenglishguy72,2,Sat Apr 11 06:40:34 2015 UTC,"I think you're being generous with the 80s.  But Australia, Perth and Liberal party are where the American dream circa 1949 came to die, it's true.  Not even America believes in it anymore.  Even Los Angeles has a couple of fairly comprehensive mass transit systems now and they have a problem with earthquakes.  Abbot will find many sympathetic ears over here though.  The Liberal party has always been trying to undermine, stop development on or remove entirely any rail system. Richard Court's government tried to stop the Joondalup line, tried to stop its extension to Currambine and beyond after that and then tried to keep quiet the fact that it was making a profit.  Still, specific and vast federal backing of huge road developments in cities that happen to be toll roads does give me extra pause.  That's a particular enthusiasm above standard road love/train hate.  I suppose the idea of a road you can privatise does fit the bill for many a Liberal party wet dream."

I think even Barnett was considering cutting back on rail until it started to become political suicide  (from memory they cancelled a whole lot of passenger cars Labor had ordered, only to find they badly needed them and had to re-order them)  I always thought it funny that Richard Court practically worshiped Lee Kuan Yew and wanted to make Perth like Singapore, or so he said (I think he just wanted to cane people and that was about it). The irony is LKY would give not a shit about some religious observance to road building.  He would grab that perfectly nice train line and use it.  If the government has to own and run it for 50yrs, who cares?  Stuff gets where it needs to go."
perth,326pqk,Muzorra,-1,Sun Apr 12 08:36:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the cost of public transport is paid back in more efficient use of public infrastructure (roads are more expensive per person-kilometre to maintain), and more efficient use of personal incomes to increase state economic activity (ie.

Good luck with that, because I'm pretty certain that on school nights, and heck, maybe weekends too, under 18s can't work past 10.  Small franchises may be your best bet.

perth,32479t,swamp_roo,8,Fri Apr 10 13:13:25 2015 UTC,"I worked nightfill in Coles for a couple of years when I was in uni.  When the shift starts all the large metal trollies will come out of the truck. 95% of the time it is only for one aisle. Therefore by looking at the contents you should be able to guess the aisle number. To answer your question, pretty organised.  Then the nightfill manager will assign you an aisle. You will have to do around 60-80 cartons an hour depending on the type of groceries. 60 per hour for like canned aisles etc and 80 per hour for soft drink aisles.  The maximum weight of a carton is 12 kilos. This can be 12 x 1L UHT milk or 6 x 2L Cordial/juice. Shouldn't be much of an issue unless you have a physical disability.  I don't wanna scare you about the 60-80 cartons an hour thing, but yeah, you will probably be doing 40 an hour in your first shift as you're learning your aisle, but it's pretty easy once you get the hang of it. You should be an expert within a couple weeks :)  Good luck and have fun! Bring your ipod etc if you like but put it in one ear. If you're working after or near closing dress casually/comfortably and wear comfortable and sturdy shoes.  Edit: You seemed pretty anxious etc about checkouts/people. The people in nightfill will be pretty cool, most seemed to be either uni students or people with day jobs looking to make some extra coin."

Those are perfect questions for your manager and whom ever will be training you on your first shifts.   From my experience, Anxiety can be relieved by asking questions and making comments about what's going on.  Say you spot expired goods on the shelf, you don't need to run through and internalise all the consequences. You just call your boss over and point, let them decide what to do etc.  Grumbly customers- vent on break, call'em miserable old cunts and you'll hear a story or two from your co-workers."
perth,32479t,Brewjo,2,Sat Apr 11 06:54:43 2015 UTC,"Much depends on the store management.  This half of the year upper management are chasing bonuses for coming in under budget.  They are often running under staffed and pushing who they've got to the limit.  Some understand that nightfil is mostly some mother or student's second job.  Some...do not.  Often as a new person the effort will be to try and condition you into the worker they've always wanted the others to be, so you might get a lot of scrutiny at first.  But don't worry too much.  They probably need your time quite a lot.  It always varies from store to store, but these days they seem to like you to even split your own load and work where ever.  So you'll probably get moved around a bit over the weeks.  If you're in one of the big stores you might have all that done for you and just get told to do the aisle.  Which is good, but don't be surprised if it doesn't last.  You'll invariably be working when the store is open too, at least at the start of the night.  And you are expected to do customer service, although as a newb you can use the excuse that you don't know where anything is and send them on for a while at least.  Which is always good.  Treasure that time.  If you haven't been inducted yet, that'll be first.  Usually work is doled out according to physical capability too.  So you'll be right there (or should be.  see caveats about management).  Light stock does often leave the nightmarish stuff like health and beauty, cat food and tuna.  So beware.  But you'll probably be fine.  It's a job that has to make do with all sorts and you're no doubt one of those."

I can see the plusses as to the Govt encouraging a more resident workforce in the town in terms of local businesses and communities.; but it's really always going to ebb and flow in terms of demand and I think small business owners in the region would have to be a lot more adaptable than their urban cousins.  People who couldn't live in a town like Karratha couldn't live in any regional town. To re-commandeer the expression; it's a lifestyle choice. Some people could never live in a city.

The best airports are what they are because they are major stopover points (e.g. Changi, KLIA, Suvarnabhumi, Dubai, Abu Dhabi etc.), governments and flagship airlines invest millions, if not billions into those airports so that tourists keep coming through, even spending a couple of nights in that country and keep flying their respective airlines (in this case: Singapore, Malaysia, Thai, Emirates and Etihad respectively).  Perth Airport is not a major transit/stopover point, it is a beginning or end destination, where domestic travel accounts for two-thirds of the passenger traffic that goes through. Of course what we have isn't the best and needs to be improved, the Airport does it job...only just."
perth,31z8eg,kanjoe07,3,Thu Apr 9 14:21:41 2015 UTC,"The same can be said for pretty much all Australian airports, none of them are major stopover points because geographically we aren't suited for it.  What Perth's will be once all the development is (finally) completed should at the very least put us on par, if not better than Melbourne's (especially considering their international terminal is way, way over capacity at the moment), which with all due respect isn't rated too highly either.  After a trip to the US, we do tend to do airports better then they do, though.

perth,31zkto,crosstherubicon,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:21:27 2015 UTC,"Third Party Insurance is a part of your rego and covers the cost of any medical injuries as a result of an accident.   The Compulsory Third Party (CTP) Policy of Insurance is printed on the back of your Motor Vehicle licence. Your CTP Policy provides you with unlimited cover (subject to compliance with conditions and warranties) against claims for personal or fatal injury caused to another person, as a result of your negligent (failure to take reasonable care) driving of a WA licensed vehicle anywhere in Australia. This means that if you or the person driving your vehicle is partly or fully responsible for causing personal or fatal injuries to another person, you or the person driving the vehicle will not be held liable for the financial cost of any claims made against you. Your CTP Policy protects you from the financial costs of any such claims. Your CTP Policy however, does not provide cover for damage to vehicles or property or injuries to the driver, where that driver is at fault.   https://www.icwa.wa.gov.au/ctp/about/ctp_faqs.shtml  So by definition, you can't drive without third party insurance but it doesn't cover any damage other than medical. You need to purchase comprehensive insurance via an insurance company to cover expenses for your / their car.   That said, what happened to them is totally illegal and they should report it to the cops ASAP. Your mate / you just got mugged."

There are in fact 3rd party, fire and theft insurance policies available to cover damage to other cars or property, but not your own vehicle.  It usually and maybe always includes fire and theft, although I may be wrong about the ""always"".

Most startup companies go up and down, they are trendy for a while but soon something else takes over. Just look at Myspace, Groupon etc.   Uber is a bit different because it provides a useful service to people and I wouldn't consider it a ""trendy"" thing. Most people use it because it is cheaper.

perth,31ufg2,aussiekinga,3,Wed Apr 8 06:22:46 2015 UTC,"Eastern Suburbs - High Wycombe, Maida Vale etc."
perth,31ufg2,excessell_tee,0,Wed Apr 8 06:24:10 2015 UTC,"Oh. Well I guess you're going to get that in areas where the authorities are justifiably concerned that fast internet access will result in Perth becoming known as the new global hub for ""419"" style internet scams.  This is the same problem as OP is facing.   Internet crime is already a huge problem that is growing rapidly in frequency and severity. It's just plain stupid to do anything that effectively puts a weapon in the hands of a group that has a significantly higher propensity for engaging in criminal activities than is the norm.  When the inhabitants of inland areas have only limited bandwidth they will use it all satisfying their porn, illegally downloaded movie and YouTube commenting needs; however, with sufficient access to fast internet they will, of course, naturally gravitate to spamming and scamming.   To put this context, would you allow inlanders free and easy access to firearms, lock-picking tools or universal car-alarm/immobiliser deactivators? Of course not.  It's fundamentally the same thing, whether openly stating so is politically correct or not!"

perth,31ufg2,eateggs,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:34:55 2015 UTC,The surrounding suburbs are all new estates so they were probably built with it in mind. Or maybe not. A few of the exchanges up there are fucking tiny and you're pretty lucky to get DSL so maybe they're providing it to areas that don't already have access.
perth,31ufg2,excessell_tee,0,Wed Apr 8 07:00:08 2015 UTC,Or any of those areas really...   I mean if people choose to live in the country they have to expect reduced access to services.
perth,31ufg2,mykalb,-1,Wed Apr 8 08:32:43 2015 UTC,This area of the city all run on sub exchanges running from Wanneroo. This means that most of them can't even get ADSL2+. This is why it was earmarked for early adoption.

perth,31ufg2,tw33kz0r,2,Thu Apr 9 01:40:38 2015 UTC,I have a friend who just built a house in landsdale (finished this year).  They are one of the first houses in their street to be finished and occupied.   They do not have any sort of internet/phone connection what so ever and they believe they are getting ADSL installed (surely that must be wrong but that is what they told me) when it finally gets installed.
perth,31ufg2,mykalb,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:26:19 2015 UTC,The new Landsdale estate is all NBN. If they are the first house they might just not have run the lines yet. This usually happens in new estates once a few houses have been completed.
perth,31ufg2,tw33kz0r,1 point,Wed Apr 8 08:46:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I thought that too but they are pretty certian they are not getting it.

I do know of someone who did commit suicide by setting their car on fire though so locking yourself in the boot is a good way to ensure you cannot back out of it at the last minute I guess =/

All car bays in the city require a levy that is paid to the ""perth parking management fund"". This money is then used to improve public transport infrastructure or alternate transport infrastructure (like cycle paths). But even still $800 a month is crazy. Especially at Central Park.

perth,31r3m1,fellandor,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:33:22 2015 UTC,"""All these copyright claims""  If you couldn't tell this ""Dallas"" copyright lawsuit is just a Media Scare Tactic.  4700 IP's were identified of downloading this ""movie"". I doubt there were only 4700 downloading this movie in Australia. Considering we have a 22 Million Population and it's been known that a substantial amount of Australian's Pirate I doubt they would have only caught 4700 people. The 4700 IP's that they caught were people that decided to seed the Movie for longer than expected to share it to others.  VPN companies are definitely profiting from this scare tactic."
perth,31r3m1,ask_me_if_im_dying,1 point,Thu Apr 9 09:31:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say media scare tactic, they are real thing. Its just that once the mainstream media get it, they sensationalise it. In reality they cant tell too well who downloads but can definitely see who uploads and its the 4700 uploaders who contributed significantly to it being downloaded again that were caught. Also vpn companies will only make a small profit off of this new market, as tons of people aren't willing to get vpn's."

perth,31r3m1,Chief_White_Halfoat5,2,Thu Apr 9 06:28:47 2015 UTC,By limiting active connections from any given IP address? I'm not that internet saavy but I imagine that's really easy to do. That's not the same as logging though is it? Logging is by definition keeping records after the fact? Unless you keep a connection open for an inordinately long time...
perth,31r3m1,besselheimPlate,1 point,Mon Apr 13 09:58:05 2015 UTC,"But that can't work cause you can be on the VPN on your desktop at home, your laptop at your partner's house and your phone on the mobile network - all different IPs, same user name and password.  The only way they can restrict logging in more than, say, 3 times simultaneously is by logging. It only depends how long they store the logs, yeah."

My wife and others attended to them and called an ambulence. I waved down cars (Albany Highway was pretty busy even today) as this poor, beautiful thing lay there damaged and dazed.

The ambos took the couple away for treatment. I was a bit shaken, we'd dodged a bullet, thankfully no one was seriously hurt but I won't be able to forget that poor beast.

I was a mobile security guard doing my patrol at about 8pm when the car in front slammed the brakes on.  The driver, a young (18-19 year old) girl threw open the door , slid onto the median kerb and sat sobbing and rocking back and forth.  I pulled over to see what was wrong (I was a security guard- not like I had anything else to do) and saw inside the car.  The roo had smashed through the windscreen and ended up in the passenger seat, laying back looking like it was having a nice nap.  For some reason, it struck me as hilarious and I burst out laughing.  Apparently, the driver did not find it anywhere near as funny.

The amount of tourists ive almost seen get themselves wrecked when I was working in the Pilbara was unbelievable. Watch out for wildlife, theres roos, emus, camels and livestock that gather to the side of the road when looking for water.   If you're heading up North there are times the roads flood and sometimes become impassable for a time. There will be wide loads on the roads so watch out for the escort (they'll also be on channel 40 if you need to communicate). If the escort is driving in the middle of the road make sure you pull as far as you safely can to the side to let it pass, dont drive off again until the last escort passes.

Backpackers are good people, but they also want to flog the car for the highest price in the quickest possible time frame. They're not going to tell you the cars realibilty or any issues. Step 2: buy a major service/oil change from groupon. If you're buying a car for less than $5k I'd recommend getting a mechanic to do a full service and oil change. Groupon usually has great offers.  Step 3: change the tyres. Just like men fear going bold, you should fear the worst when your tyres go bold. Picture rain, a darting Roo and a 50 metre aquaplane. Get tyres that stick to the road!  Step 4: travelling far? Get road assistance. Raac (I think?) offer a few different packages. Many travellers usually opt for the cheapest package but you MUST CHECK YOUR TOW LIMIT! If your car breaks down on a basic package you will usually only get 10 kilometres of tow coverage... Then your paying a premium for every kilometre thereafter. Seriously, in WA  and all aus, this adds up. Get the premium, platinum, gold plated $300 dollar cover and get towed 2000 kilometres.  Step 5: learn how to change a tyre.  Step 6: ensure you buy a car with a spare. Step 7: cheap cars usually come with little issues that can easily become big issues without proper attention. I insist you check all the lights work including indicators, break and high beams. Broken break light? Not a major problem right? Wrong, anyone who gives a shit about their car gets a break light fixed.  Step 8: Check for rusting under the car. All old cars have rust. A tad on the windows is fine, they are week points after all. Now get on your knees and check the underside of car. Rust becomes an exhaust left on the highway or possibly far worst."

perth,31ptm1,nahcoob,0,Tue Apr 7 13:53:09 2015 UTC,They did years of development and analysis to determine that Tonkin/Leach/Airport required the larger upgrade compared to Roe/Tonkin. But I'm sure your spitballing idea is right.  Edit - I looked up the information I have and the traffic signals at Roe/Tonkin should still manage fine based on the projected 2031 traffic volumes in the area. When the analysis was started in 2011 they looked at 2021 and 2031 traffic volumes and designed for 2031 volumes.
perth,31ptm1,aussiekinga,2,Wed Apr 8 00:02:59 2015 UTC,"I'm just glad that we're getting at least one full freeway/freeway interchange out of it tbh. It's a shame the funding didn't quite stretch to both, but what can you do."
perth,31ptm1,nahcoob,0,Wed Apr 8 00:33:04 2015 UTC,"The full design was done for the ultimate layout. So the current design allows for it with minimal rework. But I doubt it will happen before 2030.  I think the Northlink project is looking at a Fwy/Fwy style at Reid/Tonkin, which shall be 4-way when the project is done, with Tonkin continuing north."
perth,31ptm1,aussiekinga,-1,Wed Apr 8 00:40:11 2015 UTC,"That's come interseting and largely uninformed and wrong ideas you have there.  Actually, if he is going to Midland on Roe he shall only go through one set of lights at Roe. Not two. Westbound will have 2 still, but eastbound is one. Also, the removal of the blackspot at Roe/Berkshire is another traffic signals gone.  And I think you are seriously underestimating the difference that having a larger spacing between those traffic signals will do, plus reducing one of them from four phase movements to two. That phase reduction shall produce huge benefits for the efficiency of the system.  The current Gateway arrangement will only have 3 turn movements signalised - Roe EB -> Tonkin SB, Roe WB -> Tonkin NB and Tonkin NB -> Roe WB.  The movement on Roe/Tonkin that has the largest amount of traffic is Tonkin SB to Roe WB. This is the movement that was causing the biggest issues and is the movement that will benefit most from the upgrade. This is the movement causing congerstion, not the traffic signals. And htis movement shall be completely freeflowing (until it hits the road over rail bridge, which is the next bottleneck and is currently in design for an upgrade/duplication)  The ultimate design has it being a cloverstack, which is a much better arrangement than a cloverleaf due to merging/weaving movements required on a cloverleaf.  Also the use of a partial cloverstack gives much higher capacity and benefit for the high movement Tonkin SB -> Roe WB, compared to a cloverleaf."
perth,31ptm1,aussiekinga,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"sounds like a committee response justifying a design that any normal person would see has flaws. traffic lights hinder flow, no matter how you sugar coat it and highlight the few positives. traffic lights on hwys are, have and will always be a design flaw. other countries try to reduce, we as usual are caught in a time warp and just keep putting them in, so much so you would believe someone at main roads is a shareholder in the company installing them around the place. and i fail to see where this merging/weaving issue is. sounds like a poor excuse because you still need to merge regardless."

These interchanges include the diamond, parclo and Single-point urban (SPUI) interchanges when connecting to an arterial road in non free-flowing traffic on the crossroad and the stack or clover and stack hybrids when connecting to another freeway or to a busy arterial in free-flowing traffic where signals are still not desired.

Edit:  for details, Leach/Tonkin/Airport Drive is going be a Cloverstack Interchange (Fwy-Fwy) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_(road)#Cloverstack_interchange  Leach/Abernethy is a Single point interchange http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-point_urban_interchange  Tonkin/Kewdale/Horrie Millar is a Single Point Interchange  Tonkin/Boud (Dunreath) shall be a Dogbone http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogbone_interchange#Dogbone  Roe/Tonkin is a partial cloverstack (Tonkin SB to Roe WB shall be fwy-fwy style, along with a few of the left hand slips)  Roe/Berkshire shall be a standard Tight Diamond Interchange (similar to most Perth interchanges) with Roe over Berkshire http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_interchange#Tight_diamond  EDIT2: we shall not have a NAZI interchange though. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windmill_interchange"

perth,31ltz9,itchyballz,7,Mon Apr 6 11:40:26 2015 UTC,"edited.. whoops. No, it's been a slow decline over the past five years or so. It seems like only the most profitable businesses are able to stay afloat. Herdsman markets are a classic example - $9 for 6 hot cross buns vs the $3 at coles. As much as I hate supporting coles, I couldn't bring myself to pay $9."
perth,31ltz9,Boredtodeathbutlovef,1 point,Mon Apr 6 11:56:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but there are some really cheap ones in there too. Cooking classes seem to the most pricey for what you get - I am guessing it is for the cost of maintaining the kitchen space and possible the insurance. One of the benefits of having a centralised marketplace of courses like SkillSocials offer is that it may help to normalise the costs over time."

perth,31ltz9,boredaustralian,2,Mon Apr 6 10:15:23 2015 UTC,This is an awesome project. I have moved to Perth from Adelaide. There was a similar group there that offered many great short courses.   I was wondering if there was a similar operation in Perth and then this popped up. That sounds like a great business. Good luck.
perth,31ltz9,boredaustralian,2,Mon Apr 6 07:32:16 2015 UTC,Thanks mate! Please spread the word and let me know if you have any feedback or recommendations
perth,31ltz9,_cephei,4,Mon Apr 6 07:58:02 2015 UTC,"The only recommendation I would have is the range of courses available. Its a no brainer for sure, bit I would think DIY stuff would sell well. Mechanics, builders and similar professionals could offer great beginners courses. Just for an avenue to look at."
perth,31ltz9,omgitsmark,2,Mon Apr 6 08:15:41 2015 UTC,The website looks great and the idea behind it is awesome. I would love to help out but not sure what I can offer.  A suggestion of mine would be to change the header image to someone holding a map of Perth though ;)

perth,31m1mc,Ruff_Magician,6,Mon Apr 6 09:37:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, book online in advance...take a photo of the sign that indicates where your car is parked and what bus stop you get off at because you might not remember when you get back.    Also you probably want to allow at least 20 minutes to get from the car park to the check in desk.    You can do the online quote and work out if it is cheaper than a taxi, we car pooled so that made parking the cheaper option."
perth,31m1mc,tw33kz0r,6,Mon Apr 6 11:07:45 2015 UTC,"I've used it, but I didn't book in advance online, so I paid when I exited the car park.  From the Perth Airport website regarding online bookings:   No booking fees No printer required, simply scan the QR barcode you receive via email Make your booking as little as 2 hours prior to arrival time To book online, a minimum 24 hour stay is required.   If you book online you only save a fraction, eg. a booking from midnight tonight, exiting the car park Saturday 11th April you only save about $4 off the standard price if you paid when you exited... so it makes sense to pay online in advance if you are going away for a long time, but if it's only a short trip it wouldn't be that much of an advantage over just paying cash/sticking your card in the machine when you get back from your trip."

perth,31m1m1,pirramungi,5,Mon Apr 6 09:37:02 2015 UTC,Is your partner a geelong member? If so contact them and you can buy tickets right now. Otherwise you'll have to keep checking the ticketmaster website. Usually 1-2 weeks out they release general public tickets but being a WC game they sell out fast.
perth,31m1m1,His_Holiness,3,Mon Apr 6 09:55:00 2015 UTC,Yeah it's usually 2 weeks out.   You'll also find a limited release of tickets on the Thursday before the game due to some WCE members having put their seat up for sale. This is only a very small amount of tickets though.   Your best bet is to see if you can find any Geelong members who are willing to lend you their barcodes so you can get into the Geelong allocation.
perth,31m1m1,Chief_White_Halfoat5,2,Mon Apr 6 10:06:55 2015 UTC,"Ask over at /r/GeelongCats or /r/AFL, I'm sure someone won't mind lending you a barcode."
