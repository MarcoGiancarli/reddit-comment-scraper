Group compression can be more useful than channel compression as it glues sounds together, and also let's you know if you need to make any volume adjustments.

Pre-riding the fader makes the compressor work less, and makes its action and sound more uniform overall.  This is also true of De-essing.    if you're in protools and you don't feel like spending the aux voice on something like that - try this:   volume ride the track edit -> automation -> convert volume automation to clip gain then insert your comp on the vocal track."

For example, if you're dealing with a snare, you normally want to preserve the crack, so you want to dial back the attack just enough to allow that transient to hit, and then slow the release enough to bring up the sustain. That train of thought didn't come naturally to me at all"
audioengineering,3e20jw,Dsahnpro,4,Tue Jul 21 13:18:01 2015 UTC,"Leaving aside the hardware/software aspect of it, I definitely learned the most about compression when I started really trying to shape the percussion sound I wanted.

I feel like with percussion it's a lot easier to know when you have the ""right"" sound than it is with something like a strings section or background vocals or something, because they can be a lot more subjective. If you can learn what the different aspects of a compressor are actually supposed to do with percussion, you can then apply that knowledge to other parts by knowing what you're sound you're trying to create, and knowing what compression would add/subtract from that."
audioengineering,3e20jw,blay12,3,Tue Jul 21 14:11:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm understanding it wrong, but wouldn't a long release quiet the sustain?  It would mean the compressor is still reducing the volume based on the snare.  Am I misunderstanding something? Shouldn't you want a fast release so that you control the overall volume and have it immediately come back up so you can hear the sustain?"
audioengineering,3e20jw,hamsterwheel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:41 2015 UTC,"My bad, you are correct, I think I just confused myself a bit. a fast release would ""ready"" the compressor's attack to react the same way toward the next transient. sorry for any confusion"
audioengineering,3e20jw,Dsahnpro,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:10:10 2015 UTC,That's what I would think. Slow enough attack to have clear transients without extra EQ and a fast enough attack so that the compressor breathes and pulls up the ring.   Unless you just have it such that there's always gain reduction but compensate for it with output gain. Maybe that's what Dsahnpro is referring to.
audioengineering,3e20jw,BobagemM,2,Tue Jul 21 19:03:58 2015 UTC,"so like mastering limiter style?  I'm racking my brain trying to make sense of whats right and wrong in this scenario.  A compressor will react to a signal past the threshold by reducing the gain.  The release will make it take longer to get to full volume again, which would mean the sustain of the snare is reduced.  At least thats my logic.  unless its only shaving down only what crosses the threshold, thereby making the ""release"" actually boost everything under the threshold.    Anybody care to hop in?"
audioengineering,3e20jw,hamsterwheel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:21 2015 UTC,"I don't have the theory, but my ears tell me that it depends on the instrument/transients/timbre and what not.  For example, fast drums and snappy guitar loses apparent sustain with a very long release.  But stuff like pads and bass, sometimes a smooth vocal gains sustain with longer release.  I haven't the knowledge to confirm/explain why I have experienced this."
audioengineering,3e20jw,dofarrell313,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:29 2015 UTC,"If you're trying to control the transient/attack of the snare drum and bring it closer to the decay/ring level, you could set the compressor with a faster attack so it catches the transients and a relatively slow release so the compressor doesn't ""breathe"" too audibly when the signal falls below threshold. Set the threshold such that it only triggers on the attack of the drum and with a high enough ratio, you can kinda shave off the attack, much like a limiter as you mentioned. Crank up the output gain and the resonant aspect/ring of the snare will sound louder. The slower the release and the more dynamic range you have between the transient and the ring, the more you will need to crank the output. You end up with a pretty squashed, affected sound but it has its use I suppose. Kinda tends to be more of a damage control technique, in my experience, for poorly placed/knocked snare mics.  Not my slice of pie as far as drum sounds go, but I feel like a lot of  radio hard rock uses this technique, or something similar. Someone else might have a better example."
audioengineering,3e20jw,BobagemM,2,Tue Jul 21 22:34:42 2015 UTC,to be honest I always leave my snare fairly uncompressed. If you have thick rock mixes you want the transient to cut through anyways.  Too much sustain and I'd be worried about my mix turning to mush.

Besides knowing technically what the knobs do, know what they do to the sound.  Higher ratios, will put things further back in a mix, while low ratios will keep things up front and natural.  A fast attack can make your snare stick sound smaller, while a slower attack, your snare stick will be bigger and closer.  Release affects the tail, but it's also your groove maker.

audioengineering,3e20jw,themachinerages,0,Tue Jul 21 14:44:02 2015 UTC,Parallel perhaps...plugins dont handle heavy compression well.  Personally speaking... if i'm compressing much more than 4db there is a problem in tracking better dealt with by volume automation.  This advice is for beginners of course as per the original question not gearslutz style argument.

There literally is no right answer here.. You could achieve amazing results on a metal singer with a U87, and then use that same U87 with less then stellar results on a pop singer..     The best advice I have is, unless you have lots of clientele you are working with, find one good mic that works for you, that you feel good about.  Otherwise just start building your mic locker..  Start with the basics, 58's, 57's, and work your way up.    When I work with a new singer, I pick 2-3 mics that I think will represent that singer well, set them up with the diaphragms as close together as possible, and have the singer stand ~12-18 inches away from those mics.  I'll then go with my gut on what sounds best.  Nothing like a little mic shootout before a session gets going."

What kind of sound are you going for, what kind of voice does the singer have, what are the genre expectations.   These are all things you need to consider when picking out a microphone.    Example, a U87 is a great microphone for melodic singers but because of the transient response probably isn't the best for a fast paced rapper but a SM7b would work very nicely for that job."

audioengineering,3e52kz,powerval,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:46:06 2015 UTC,"I once played in a jam with just that mic recording us. It worked really well, surprisingly!  Placement depends on the sound you want. Phase won't be an issue, so just try different positions ranging from above the snare to down on the level of the kick drum. You probably won't want to have the mic on one side or the other, unless you want a deliberately unbalanced sound. When I use just one mic, I usually place it about 6 feet in front of the kit and level with the top of the kick.  EQ/compression/etc. will follow from what kinds of sounds you start with. Sometimes I go so far as to duplicate the track and use one for the lower end (toms and kick) and the other for high (snare and cymbals)."
audioengineering,3e52kz,bwooceli,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:54:31 2015 UTC,"The drummer-pov mic angled more toward the snare works as well.  Food for thought, if you can spare another $60 Behringer sells a pair of pencil condensers that's actually work just fine as OH.  Even comes with the stereo mount.  Then you can use your AT for the kick (which IMHO you will miss if you don't have a dedicated kick).    One final consideration is that you can always track the drums and cymbals separately.  Not just a trick for amateurs on a budget, no-names like the Foo Fighters have been known to do this."

audioengineering,3e2jw1,SingleFinSoul,5,Tue Jul 21 13:44:32 2015 UTC,"Of course, the ""ideal"" level for recording is 0 dBFS (peak!), and the reason being is maximum signal to noise radio. Now, if you are recording with 16 bits, this is a big deal. I believe when digital recordings first came out engineers would put compressors/limiters before the preamp to get the hottest signal without clipping. The reality is now with 24 bit recording, and 32 bit floating/48 bit mixers, no one needs to do this.  24 bit recording translates to something like 144 dB, which is super loud.    To calibrate your speakers, get pink noise in your daw that is calibrated for -20 dB RMS while all faders in your daw are zeroed.  While this is playing out of one channel (L or R), grab an SPL meter and begin turning up your interface volume or however you turn up your speakers until the meter reads 83 dB SPL, slow, C weighted. Do this for the other channel.   Once you've done this, whenever you record something with a relatively constant level (like a bass guitar) at -20 dBFS, the signal to noise ratio (if 24 bit recording) is pretty good, and your volume is good and loud.  The extra 20 dB is for things that DON'T have a small crest factor (average to peak difference) like snare drums.  You want to get the ""average"" loudness of the snare drum to be -20 dBFS, but let the peaks fall ANYWHERE, just as long as it doesn't clip.  If you want to read more on this, get Bob Katz' book and he explains all of this and more!  tl;dr: if your using 24 bit recording, adjust the preamp gain such that your getting a strong signal, but not hot enough that you're worried that it might clip if drummer plays harder.  You aren't losing any resolution really."
audioengineering,3e2jw1,avid9736,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:25:04 2015 UTC,"Typically when you record your levels should be anywhere from -24 to -8 db, I like to try and get a consistent level of about -12 db the reason being that most plugins and outboard gear work optimally with that level of a signal.   When I mix I try keep the peaks of my mix around -8 db to give myself plenty of headroom for mastering."
audioengineering,3e2jw1,TheMaster0rion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:22 2015 UTC,"So I've likely been recording too hot. I've been playing safecracker with my interface/preamp to get my acoustic guitar to never go above 0 for the occasional loud accidental strum, when I reality I should be setting that dial quite a bit lower.   I should leave my stereo out fader at 0 and adjust the subgroup/track levels so it never goes above -8. Good to know.   Thanks!"
audioengineering,3e2jw1,Nattramn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:44 2015 UTC,"I'd say going for a maximum peak of -20/-18 dB would be a good choice. It depends on the plugins and hardware you will use... Most of them work better when you record at the dB range stated in their manuals, which again, is most likely to be around the -22dB to -12dB range."

If you want it this bad, then yes, go to school.  Other posters have said you can learn these skills from YouTube, but that's baloney.  90% of the videos on YouTube (that's a generous estimate) are crap.  Learning by doing is key, no doubt about it, but so is having a good team of mentors who can guide your education, give it focus, point you in the right direction.  Reputable music engineering programs have good placement departments (but cannot of course guarantee your success).  Be prepared to be the best student in the class, and also be prepared to do lots and lots and lots of recording and mixing on your own outside of school.  Doing it is the only way to get good at it, but getting some book knowledge gives you focus, direction, context, guidance, and background.  If you want this 100%, go to school for it. If you're half-assed about wanting this, or even if you're 90%-assed, then do something else, because it's a hard fucking business.

audioengineering,3dz8j4,smcdow,16,Tue Jul 21 14:01:06 2015 UTC,"People don't go into Audio Engineering because of the money. They get into it because they have a passion for being around and being a part of the process of making music, specifically making records. It is very different than being a musician, and equally not lucrative until you get into the big time and even then it is hard to maintain steady income. There is no steady in music and even less so in audio engineering considering how ""affordable"" it is to make music in your bedroom or garage these days. People pay you for taste or for your gear both of which take years and lots of money to master.   I went to a csu school for audio engineering and graduated last year and have been actively working as a musician and audio engineer. My band also has a business where we rent out 10 rehearsal rooms per month. That has enabled my band to tour, put out new music and build upon our business. I have also helped build a small studio in which I record bands out of. This has all taken approximately 5 years(most of which this past year) and I am just now starting to see some profit coming into my bank account from it. Building businesses takes time, investment and struggle. School was worth it for me because I learned a lot and had family who pretty much paid for all of it. While it was not crazy expensive like private music schools(Which should be avoided unless you are fairly wealthy), it was still a huge investment into music and audio engineering. Schooling is simply not enough in this market as well. You will have to spend much time simply learning on your own and doing it for yourself and for others for pretty much free.   There are other aspects to audio engineering such as film, tv, radio, and internet media. Getting into those fields requires less initial investment but an equal amount of time interning and learning the skills.   So if you are not 100 percent passionate about engineering or music I suggest you look elsewhere.

It might be very hard to make a career in AE or music prod.

If you still have a passion for audio engineering you would be better suited with an EE background by being able to fix most things found in a studio. If you owned a studio and had the choice between someone who went to one of these music production schools or someone with an EE background who would you choose? Dont get me wrong, some people have done well with those school but you can learn everything from them online minus the hands on with the big boards and stuff.  Thats just my opinion though, GL on your research."

audioengineering,3dz8j4,rickymcnuggets,3,Mon Jul 20 22:48:06 2015 UTC,This. If immediately after graduation I realized how important the electronics aspects of my degree I learned in school were. It also opens the door to get out of music should you find it is not what you want to do.
audioengineering,3dz8j4,rec_desk_prisoner,3,Tue Jul 21 01:51:31 2015 UTC,I'll second this. Any time I interview an intern I steer the conversation to electronics and they almost always have zero experience. In school they make you fix a couple cables with a soldering iron and that's about it. Basic electronic troubleshooting is a minimum requirement to be useful in a recording studio. If you can't tell me at least basically how Ohm's law works then I'm going to be nice but I won't call you back. I am surprised at how many have never even built their own computer.

(check out mixoff.org and maybe Shaking Through to).  and for the love of god, dont even think about opening your own studio until you have so many clients that you just aren't able to book them all as a freelance guy.  while starting out you'll need a job. i suggest figuring out how to become a bartender. they make the most money in the shortest time. and its all under the table. start as a busser, then waiter, then barback, and then bartender.   i think a big part of getting clients at first is genuinely being part of the music community where you live. make real friends and record them."

audioengineering,3dz8j4,cloudstaring,3,Mon Jul 20 19:49:48 2015 UTC,"This whole anti audio school thing on this sub seems very US cantered. In Australia there are some good places that won't put you ridiculously in debt, and I would recommend going to them because you can learn the basics you NEED to know.   Before I went I didn't know what a condenser mic was, balanced line etc. A year or so later I was getting regular work and have been ever since. Only cost me around $1000 for a year and.a half diploma (government subsidised).  I learnt heaps and got to do my own thing in a pretty decent studio so I would recommend that for sure.   I've met some engineers who never went to any audio schools and they sometimes have big gaps in their knowledge, like not knowing what clocking is. That's not a hard and fast rule, but generally people who have gone through school have the fundamentals down and are at least at the stage where they know enough to know if its for them or not.   Out of 30 odd students I started with only me and two others stuck with it and still work in audio fields."
audioengineering,3dz8j4,sjleader,2,Tue Jul 21 03:42:54 2015 UTC,"The problem is in the US unless you already have a lot of money, the cost of school is just ridiculous. If you take out loans, you are looking at $75 to $100k in debt walking into a market where there are almost no paying jobs (because there is a line of people out my studio door waiting for an ""internship"" to work for free,) and it will take you 30 years to pay that loan back.    I agree- education and school is great! But not if you wind up with a lifetime of debt."
audioengineering,3dz8j4,scottbrio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:27:30 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with the anti-audio school thing either. I went to school for it and got a bachelors in sound. What I learned in those 2.5 years prepared me for my future more than any amount of tinkering could have. It's like saying: don't go to school for business! Get a briefcase and a suit and walk around down town every day!  But seriously- for my final in the Advanced Recording Production class (the last class you take before graduating) I was put in charge of a multi million dollar studio with a live band and told to record a song with a famous producer (special teacher) in the room with me- watching. The hair that you grow on your chest from that session alone (assuming you float, not sink) will last you a lifetime. I'll admit- I should have known more, studied a bit more, BUT, out of five other students I was the only one able to get the console working with Pro Tools and track audio. Why? Well, most likely because I genuinely give a shit about audio. I'm obsessed with it, and I'm fairly certain the rest of the students in that room were not. There are many people who sign up for these schools because they think they can get a degree in ""something fun""- only to realize this shit is science, not a walk in the park.   If you're the later of those two people, I would suggest pursuing another career. On the other hand, if you live and breathe music/audio/sound/etc and are technically inclined- go for it. You'll have a blast, work your ass off, and have a degree at the end.  I run into ""audio guys"" who ""learned it in the field"" all the time who kind of have no idea what they're doing. They can make things work, sort of, but most of the time it sounds like ass."
audioengineering,3dz8j4,sjleader,2,Tue Jul 21 08:41:37 2015 UTC,Did you have to take out student loans? If so what do you owe? 2.5 years-- so you have an associates degree?
audioengineering,3dz8j4,scottbrio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:28:09 2015 UTC,"No loans, no debt fortunately. My dad had a high paying job briefly in the late 90's and put money aside for my college tuition. My school was pricey (~$70k) but not as expensive as many other schools. It was one of the first audio schools to have an accredited program. I got a bachelors degree in the science of sound in an accelerated program- so a 4 year degree in 2.5 years.  It was one of the best experiences of my life."
audioengineering,3dz8j4,dswpro,4,Tue Jul 21 22:13:14 2015 UTC,Yes but you might also consider an education in computer science. It is very applicable to audio engineering and far more in demand.

audioengineering,3dz8j4,dswpro,2,Mon Jul 20 19:42:22 2015 UTC,"You can go a lot of ways. Product development. Find manufacturers who need programmers. (And they all need programmers) .  Service companies . (Sound reenforcement, production services). They need tech's with knowledge of data cabling, switches, routers, audio over UTP networks., plus their desktop PCs.  And every recording studio out there is running protocols or DAW and needs help with networks, plugins, OS upgrades, you name it. Then there is writing your own apps, plugins, or other software. Where do you want to go? I would start with product manufacturers who have the largest budgets, frankly. Get your feet wet and see their customers where you might want to work later."

Talk your way into them anyway.  Electrical Engineering is your best bet.  A lot of those classes will deal with DSP for RF processing, so the DSP will be in the complex domain (and audio DSP is almost always strictly real numbers), but you'll get a really good education in sampling theory, convolution, filtering, basebanding, etc.  Learning all that stuff will be fundamental if you want to do things like writing effects plug-ins, etc.  Caveat: those will be hard classes; don't expect high grades."

audioengineering,3dz8j4,tadhgerty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:05:39 2015 UTC,"I am a recent Computer Science graduate. There is very little involved that is applicable to audio engineering. My school didn't have any sort of DSP classes which I would expect is the norm; even then this is not very useful for actually making music. Parts of discrete math and the other theory courses you take are relevant to how sound and DSP work but that knowledge is wholly unnecessary for an artist.  However, it does teach you work ethic and discipline to balance the two. And you may be able to take decent music-related electives.   Not sure if I would recommend it to someone who 100% wants to make a living producing music. That's me now but when I was 17 I had no idea really, I had just picked up a copy of Fruity Loops a few months prior to applying and produced for fun on the weekends back then. It's a lot of work to graduate and then even more to get and perform a job - there are like zero part time gigs doing programming. Looking back, I would say look for something more flexible for you to pour more hours into your passion if you want to be on the fast track to doing music for a living."
audioengineering,3dz8j4,dswpro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:00:46 2015 UTC,"Per capita, very few people actually earn a substantial living composing or playing music, even fewer producing music. Audio engineering, without a BSEE or BSCS is a very competitive field which drives pay down.  Computer science has fed me well in and out of the professional audio industry.   Were I fresh out of computer science today I would seek an additional credential in audio production from an accredited school while programming part time to pay the bills. Then find the industry where i want to work and network.   You can balance passion and profession ."
audioengineering,3dz8j4,tadhgerty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:04:43 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. My point is that software development is a very competitive field of its own, and having interviewed with companies recently, several have seriously expected me to love development the way I love producing music, on top of the schooling and experience I have. I have seen very few jobs below 37-40 hours of work a week as well.  I believe building a successful career working in audio (or any field) is largely correlated to how many hours you put in. There is a massive time investment to get anywhere near hire-able not dissimilar to having to go through 4 years of university to get into your desired field. Except there's no B- for doing something sort of ok, not much encouragement for it as a ""realistic prospect"" (like doing a decade of school to be a doctor might be seen) and depending on your connections, no one to teach you how to do much, unless you pay a lot of money to go to school which may or may not help you much either vs. what you can do on your own.  I'm saying if you know what you want to do and you want your passion to be your profession, it's a super roundabout way to go to 4 years of college to do a job you don't really want to do to support the job you do want to do. Your experience is valid, but probably not the advice I would give someone who actually wants to be an full-time engineer or artist rather than a DSP programmer or web developer for an audio company. As far as whether or not that's realistic, I will borrow what another user in this forum said:   Is it realistic: No.  Is it impossible: No."
audioengineering,3dz8j4,dswpro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:23:59 2015 UTC,"True. Happiness comes from knowing what you want and getting it. If that's producing music, go for it.

Of course, I'm one of those amateurs too, but still.   This tells me two things: (1) there ARE people out there making a living at this, but (2) the competition is VERY stiff.   I'm sure every major town has enough pro and amateur engineers out there that many are working for very low pay and others are giving away their services for free.

Your friends are going out every saturday night to partys or social events? Forget about it; you will be working. Hoping for 9-5 mon - fri work week so you can surf on the weekend and hang out with friends after work? Forget about it. Im married and have a kid and I have just adapted to sleeping less and not seeing my friends as much or having a life outside of work as much. My days are spent from 6:30am - 7:40am hanging with my son; then working in sound in the film industry from 8am - 7pm (if we are not busy; otherwise it may be 100+ hour weeks when its busy), then hanging with my son and putting him to bed then heading into my home studio to mix from 8:30pm - 12am almost every day without fail.

I went into post production (dialogue editing, sound design, voice over recording, etc.) I chose post production because at the time, there was still some money to be made in it. The other side of the coin, working in a music studio, was cut throat. I worked at the same post house for 5 years. Made my way from an intern to senior engineer. The work is tedious, and the money wasn't great. I was working 8-16 hours a day for 6 days a week sometimes more.   I had decided I wanted to see what else was in my field (other than post production), so I quit and started freelancing. If you have ANY inclination towards laziness, if you are not a self motivator, or have no idea how to sell yourself, DO NOT freelance. It's brutal.  I agree with what everyone else said in this post so far. It's tough, there is no real money in it. You have to really love the process of making music, and just have a passion for audio in general. You will never be rich in this field.  Now, I work 2 jobs, I run a rehearsal space on the weekends, and my main job I work at a school for audio engineering. Looking out from the inside, I see how schools pump out tons and tons of students yearly. The market is saturated. Most of them won't even work in the field and just have massive debt from going to school.   Is it worth it? I would say no, but if you do go through with it, just know that you'll be eating ramen and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for dinner most nights. Forget about a relationship and dating. Beer after work with friends? Won't happen. Vacation? I don't even know the last time I had more than 1 day off. Do I regret it? Hell no, I love what I do, I meet interesting people, and I get to share my knowledge of audio."

A few years ago, I was wondering if I had the right combination of determination and persistence to make it as an audio engineer and I searched various forums around the internet to get an idea.  I found a lot of similar things said here, but one that stuck out to me is that if you want to get on the audio engineering career path, you will end up sacrificing a lot of common job benefits like steady health insurance. I like the reply here that mentioned you can't expect a pension and you'll have to set up your own 401k.   I love music, and I love being around music as much as possible,  but I decided it wasn't worth sacrificing benefits like steady health insurance and solid retirement to get into audio engineering. These days I make enough to support myself with a more stable job and I produce on the side whenever I can. If you're truly willing to give up those benefits and stability, go for it, because this life is the only chance you're going to get to achieve your dreams. Just fully understand everything you have to sacrifice."
audioengineering,3dz8j4,ukepriest,2,Mon Jul 20 23:56:20 2015 UTC,"I went to school for it. Funnest 2 years of my life. I learned a ton and met a lot of great people. It has not paid off financially, 10 years after graduating - not even close. But I have a cool home studio where I can record drums at 3 in the morning and I'm starting to get enough clients that I can pay a few bills with it.  Would that have happened if I hadn't gone to school? Hard to say. But I can definitely say I would not be as good at what I do. You have to get immersed in it, with real gear, and people who really know what they're doing. I suppose an internship at a studio might be good too, but as far as I know, those are super hard to come by."

If you're interested in writing or music, journalism or audio engineering provide this sense of protection because, unlike being a novelist or a popstar, there's a possibility of actual employment. It's true; some people are employed by large studios or work for newspapers. Many more make a living freelancing. Many more don't make a living at all.  It's certainly easier than making it as an artist, but expect about the same degree of difficulty and hustle. Not impossible by any means. Just have to want it.  I guess what pretty much everyone is saying in this thread is that you shouldn't let the possibility of employment trick you into thinking that an audio engineering degree is a solid investment. It's not -- it's high risk. The question is: do you want to bet on yourself?"
audioengineering,3dz8j4,hzme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:30:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I think the question is more ""do you need to go to school?"". I didn't, and I've worked full time as a recording engineer for about 10 years and other positions in the industry for years before that.  I don't necessarily recommend paying for school, depending on your resources. If that's the only place you will get the environment and resources to work, then go for it, because that's what you're paying for. Yes, guidance will help, but it can only go so far. In this industry you learn by doing.  I'd say invest in some basic equipment and start doing. Recording local bands, student films, recording audio books for the blind, it doesn't matter. Just find things that need to be done and get them done well. (I'd also say live sound is an excellent way to learn signal flow, trouble shooting, and working under pressure.)  I'll also say this as someone who has had to hire entry level engineers, I don't care about your degree, your Pro Tools certification, your feelings on an 1176 vs an LA-2A or how well you can get around an SSL,  What have you done? How many sessions/projects have you ever gotten through? Will my clients feel like they're in good hands?   Have satisfactory answers to those questions, and you will find yourself a mediocre 60k a year job."

They pay is pretty good and you will gain experience by doing, it is hard to get on the calls at first so you will need a part time job.  If you have the money to throw around, college isn't a terrible idea. I have a BA in RTvF and it is entirely useless in the field but I got a degree and I had a great time. If you don't have money to throw around, spend your money on housing and keep yourself somewhat available to take the IATSE call when it comes.   I know a guy that joined the local just to be able to apply at an opera house, he was already making good money in the industry but in order to get an interview he had to be a member. This is all to say that the majority of the audio professionals are members because the industry needs us to function."

Reading through the comments, I'm so happy I didn't come across a thread like this 10 years ago. I have a diploma in applied music and a degree in film scoring. The engineering side came from years of experience making music. Sure, I can understand most of what people have said in this thread. However, we each will find our own way to succeed in life. Determination and hard work is a part of every path unless you have nepotism on your side and that can be a handicap more than an advantage for certain personalities.   If you are willing to work hard and find creative solutions you will make it work. Its not all doom and gloom. You will find that those that have a harrowing story about how challenging everything is are ready and willing to share their experience.  Only you know how to go about uncovering your path. People will tell you how they managed to find success, but don't use it as a blueprint, use it to inform your decisions like any other piece of gathered information. A solid work ethic, a passion for what you do and the ability to step outside yourself and understand the people and opportunities around you will serve you well.   Audio isn't the only overcrowded market out there. Just find your niche, your sound, your unique identity.   I'll tell you one thing, technical furniture is a niche in the audio realm. I know a guy who spends all day building rack spaces, console desks, speaker stands, podiums. Loves his work, has a killer studio and ships all over North America. He says he has very little competition, not a lot of people are doing the whole custom studio furniture thing. Food for thought."

I'm a huge proponent of giving it a go without spending 30k+ and going into massive amounts of debt to obtain a career that doesn't really require one.  Get an internship at a local venue or studio.  That's obtainable now.  Through this experience, figure out 1. How much do you specifically really need to go to school?, and 2. If this is really for you at all?  I left louisiana, went to La, got a job at guitar center, and after a month was interning at ocean studios in Burbank. No, it was not luck.  I applied my ass off everywhere I could.  Now, to be fair, I had a 4 track tape machine when I was 14.  So my other piece of advise is to start now.  Recording equipment has gotten even more affordable than when I was younger.   Now I'm 33, paying off a mortgage, with a studio that records music on an mci jh428 that I restored, and also does ADR for published TV shows and movies, and also does some foley.  Plus I get to 2nd chair feature film mixes routinly.    The point is there isn't one set career path for this like there is for being a doctor or lawyer.  So I'd say give it a go, and remember school will always be there.  The tuition money will not.  And in a field that is hard to be successful in that requires much sacrifice,  I'm glad to never have taken on the massive amount of debt that school demands.  To put it another way, college seems to be proving itself a worse and worse idea in a number of fields much more applicable than audio engineering.  You've chosen a path where you will never lose work for a lack of education.  At least try and take advantage of that.  And don't rule out going into film and other media.  There's a lot of stability there.  I've mixed over 50 features at this point, including some you've certainly heard of.  And whatever you do, don't go to full sail."

audioengineering,3dzrjz,saponsky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:41:32 2015 UTC,I think you are thinking about the output gain. My question is referring to the threshold as in the point to where the limiter starts applying gain reduction. No?
audioengineering,3dzrjz,Herbejo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:50:31 2015 UTC,"when you pull the threshold down it changes the point at which your level cannot go higher than but almost all limiters link a gain stage to to this that does the opposite(eg waves limiters), so if you pull the threshold down 3db it will boost the output 3db meaning that the level you signal cannot go pass effectively stays at 0dbfs. meaning that it effectively does the same thing as boosting the input gain. the threshold method of doing limiters is a layover from the days of pro tools tdm."

audioengineering,3dzrjz,Herbejo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:16:15 2015 UTC,"you are correct, but almost every limiter has a gain boost doing the opposite of the threshold so if you pull the threshold down 3db it will boost the output 3db, meaning that the end result of pulling the threshold down is the same as boosting the input gain."

audioengineering,3dzrjz,Staidly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:15:33 2015 UTC,"Kinda yes, kinda no. The interaction between the signal and the threshold stays the same (6 dB of boost being the same as a 6 dB reduction in threshold) but obviously when you lower the threshold it means your signal can't go above that threshold. Sooo technically the output of a 6 dB boost is the same as a 6 dB reduction in threshold if you apply 6 dB makeup gain after lowering the threshold."
audioengineering,3dzrjz,Velcrocore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:08:05 2015 UTC,One thing to keep in mind is that hardware and software limiters will both distort when too much signal is given. One might sound cooler than the other.

Are you using pirated and recompressed episodes for your comparison? Theme songs are definitely loud for a reason. I promise everyone who's career has been doing audio for film and TV has not accidentally compressed the beginning of the episode twice. I imagine there are a number of reasons why it increases viewers, even on an emotional level."
audioengineering,3dxdoo,Xyntax,9,Mon Jul 20 18:25:28 2015 UTC,"No. In these days of loudness metering,  I would be surprised if any theme song (especially those that are allready compressed and limited) hits the limiter in post. My limiter is set to catch the peaks at -3dBFS (and I use very, very little compression on my mixbuss). If I were to push the compressed/limited theme song to hit my limiter, that would be extremely loud, to the point where I would not be able to comply to specs (We are urged, at least in my region in Europe, not to exceed a momentary loudness of -15LUFS. Luckily in my experience the networks aren't to strict about it, but a theme song that loud would not pass qc).  I think there are a couple of reasons why one would put the theme song a little louder. In the pre loudness days, I would mix the opening music deliberatly louder in an attempt to kind of keep up with the commercials before the show. If I wouldn't, the gap in loudness would make the show sound small, lackluster and quite frankly unappealing in the eyes of many (exactly like the loudness war in music). Things have improved a lot with loudness specs, but louder is still precieved as better. So a louder opening tune still has more impact.  It's also a matter of preference. Maybe the director or producer likes it. In fact, in a lot of cases I like it. Let's say you've got a CSI-like show that starts of with the crime as an intro before the opening credits. In a lot of cases you've got a suspense filled scene that's not very loud at all. I like it when the opening credits break that suspense by being louder. Dynamics can really drive a story, even with the opening credits.  That said, The levels should make sense. And a difference of 8dB seems like a lot (compared to a show overall, if compared to the previous or next scene, it could make perfect sense). I, at least, have not perceived theme songs to be excessively loud in general. Certainly not to that extent."

audioengineering,3dxdoo,RobinUrthos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:39:20 2015 UTC,"Most TV stations use hardware compression and limiting to adjust the broadcast to -9 dB* or so, regardless of source loudness.  I've never come across a situation where the theme is significantly louder than the show, most likely specifically due to this.  (Plus, it's pretty hard to bring most music above -9 dB without it sounding horrible.)  Anyways, in any sane situation, the show's sound engineer would adjust the theme loudness to match the rest of the show.  The TV station's signal processing should not change this significantly.  Out of curiosity, what show are you watching, from what station, and on what medium?  *This figure changes depending on the intended content of the station.  News doesn't need to be very dynamic, but movies do."

So... to me, it seems like this is more than just a numbers game.  Edit:  How do I even know how much gain a given microphone requires?  Is it listed on the specs somewhere?

The Shure manual recommends 60db of gain for an sm7b, which is what the mackie has.  You are looking for the sensitivity rating for the microphone, which is usually buried in the manual, and not on the spec sheet."

Not only do I buy used, I buy from eBay - Just last night I bought a $600 channel strip at half price in an auction, (mainly due to the fact that the owner had put a picture of the back the unit as the main pic and nobody bothered to scroll through the pics).  The only bad experience I've had was when I bought a Presonus BlueTube for $50 and when I came to replace the tube, I found that the previous owner was a dumbass and had tried to open the case and when he failed he wedged the case shut so I had to cut the little tabs off and the whole thing became a mess, pad button and a VU backlight stopped working and I didn't feel like going back into the case.  So the lesson I've learned, is theres a certain range of gear that you shouldn't buy, anything beginner for example, because the previous owners most likely didn't take care of them well, like the infamous Blue Yeti, I'd never buy that from ebay because most likely the previous owner was a snot filled teenager doing a podcast lol.

As I fix my own equipment, I always consider what is likely to go wrong, and what is within my abilities to repair.   I avoid products that were originally cheaply made, and have a lot of mechanical parts, like cheap mixing desks. Basically because most of the cost of these is in the pots/switches, and if they are getting to the end of their life it's not worth fixing.  Quite often you need to replace a fader with the exact same model to make it fit on the circuit board, and these can be hard to find. Sometimes I even take apart and clean/repair broken faders on mixers and synths. This is tedious, but sometimes there is no other option.  Tape machines should be very carefully examined too, as again they have mechanical parts that wear. Tape heads can be very expensive to replace, if you can find a NOS replacement at all.

audioengineering,3duymx,carpit_tarnivore,3,Sun Jul 19 20:17:21 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a complicated question. Replicating the feeling of many many layers of recorded singing is going to be somewhat difficult to do in any other context. This is definitely something of an ""Enya"" effect where it was largely made with a great deal of layering and reverb.  The first thing you're going to want is to unison your melody either two or three octaves below the original. You can put a third unison in between but at a much lower volume and see how that sounds. In this particular song, my ears tell me that there is a chord of voices in the bass, not just a unison. Play with stacking notes and see what results you get, but be careful not to just fill the entire piano roll. Space in the middle is key, I think.  The second thing you're going to want to do is get some quality convolution reverb going. Stock plugins probably won't cut it for this kind of effect. Like carpit_tarnivore said, adding multiple reverbs of different lengths is a good approach.  EQ can be useful here too. The effect that this song is getting is (in my opinion) caused mostly by the openness in the middle of the spectrum with a lot going on the low and high ends.  If all else fails, I'd make an extra copy of the lead melody and run it through a ""blur"" effect, but that part's really just a guess. Good luck!"

In terms of moving the speakers further, one big ask would be for them to flip the orientation of their living room, so their speakers are on the other side of the room -- i.e. say 12 feet away rather than a few inches away from our shared wall. Of course, we could also flip the orientation of our bedroom, so our bed head is on the other side of our bedroom, around 10 feet away. Do you think that would make a big difference?

audioengineering,3dutma,trifelin,2,Sun Jul 19 18:47:07 2015 UTC,"Moving them across the room might help a little, but the real problem is that they are making contact with the floors and walls. Cinder blocks help because they are not resonant (like wood), and they put air space between the speaker and the resonant material (the floors & walls). A plastic, metal, or concrete box with holes is what you want to look for. If they don't like the cinder block look, perhaps masking the cinder blocks with an attractive fabric cover would be better? It would also prevent floor scratches! Rubber feet glued to the bottom of the speakers and then sitting them on a rug may also work, but I've personally never tried that. Just throwing out ideas.   Edit: That's not to belittle having more distance, too. Distance from every resonant surface is what you want to go for."

You can decide on a range of numbers to allocate to the amplitude of a waveform, and then assign numerical values corresponding to voltage/current/whatever at discrete times.  It's become common to use it as a synonym for digitising, which is the process of taking a series of samples of part of or the entirety of an analog thing in order to represent it in a digital format.  Samplers play back samples, which in this context are digitised sounds from an analog source, rather than discrete measurements of amplitude. Samplers are triggered by midi data, which in turn can be sent by a midi keyboard (sometimes integrated into the sampler unit) or a midi sequencer.

There are two different things that we refer to as samples in audio.  First there is the sample that refers to a single data point in a digital waveform. It is just a piece of information that says ""at this point in time, the audio level is at this data value"" and in conjunction with a bunch of other samples, they make up a digital waveform that then creates an audio signal (once its gone through a DA converter and into your ears.) This is where you get terms like sample rate that refer to how many 'samples' of the sound wave make up one second worth of audio.  The other is a term meaning to 'sample' a piece of music or audio usually for the purposes of remixing or playing back through a instrument like an MPC or digital recreations of analogue instruments (i.e. a VST pino made from samples of a grand piano.) this is usually where you see the word used as a verb (i.e. ""im sampling a bunch of old vinyl records and producing a sweet hip hop track"")'  Essentially, all digital audio is a series of samples that go together to produce a sound wave. So if you're working in digital audio, there really isn't a way to escape the word samples, the entire format is built around sample rate and bit depth. they are the two variables that define the resolution and quality of audio. I don't know how it refers to oscilloscopes in your 'literature' but my guess would be that it might either be referring to digital oscilloscopes which likewise would take a sample rate (probably variable and able to be set quite high) or it would be talking about using an oscilloscope to look very closely at a digital audio signal and see the individual samples (they would look like steps going either up or down on a sound wave.)

audioengineering,3dxs4v,Taupter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:32:03 2015 UTC,"First, you can't hear a digital audio signal. One of the biggest misconceptions is that a DAC works by rendering an audio signal as a staircase. A sample datum in a digital signal has no time slice, it has position in time and amplitude, so the sample datum itself has a duration of 0t (t = time unit). If it was rendered as a staircase a lot of harmonics would be added to the audio signal, changing it considerably.  Even if your sample is not an instant measure but the averaged amplitude of a tiny slice of time (~A/t) as a sample datum it would be stored at a fixed time ( (A/t)/t = (A/t)/(t/1) = (A/t)(1/t) = A1 = A, no time unit anymore ), being itself timeless.

These formulas are time based, to they're by definition continuous, and to generate a waveform they'll have so sample a continous time in a given frequency (discretization) and it is in fact sampling, even if only in the digital domain.  Even if you are using a virtual sampler it would still stretch/change pitch of its stored samples (thus converting from time domain to the frequency domain), and as such the signal is changed and will need to be resampled (rendered in the time domain according to the new parameters), so it's sampling.  Even if you just convert a mono 44100Hz 16bit sample to 22050Hz 8bit using the simplest algorithm (getting one value of every pair and dividing it by 256 - usually just right-shifting the value 8 bits and storing the result) you'll still be creating discrete values in a time domain, thus sampling.  If you upscale your audio from 22050Hz 8bit to 44100Hz 16bit you'll generate intermediary values based on your current data (that is in fact a time domain function that you'll use to calculate those additional values), it's still sampling.  So, no dice. No matter what you do to digital audio (apart from converting to analog), it's still sampling. You're stuck with it, live with it. :)"
audioengineering,3dxs4v,SoCoMo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:37:10 2015 UTC,"Digital waveforms are a representation of an analog waveform. Think of recording in to your computer like printing to a tape machine. Same concept.  Every recorded waveform has 2 characteristics: the concept of time, and the signal-level component. In analog, that's frequency and amplitude, but digitally, the concept of time is sampling, and the signal level is quantization.  Before I say anything else, AD conversion is the reason why sampling is a thing, so I feel like I have to bring it up regardless.  Sampling is the concept of time. Simple as that. Over time, the analog waveform is recorded in, the converter holds the signal while it determines the incoming voltage level at that exact time. The samples are just binary words that the computer stores to play back or ""release"" at the next time, kind of like playing back a tape.  That being said, samples only have half the frequency range of their sample rate, according to the Nyquist Theorum. The sample rate is how often the sample is taken and held per second, and according to the Nyquist Theorum, the full frequency range of the sampled waveform is only half of the sample rate, so if you have a sample rate of 48kHz, the highest frequency you can store in the sampled waveform is 24kHz. Half of the sample rate is called the Nyquist Frequency, for it is the highest frequency you can effectively record.. For example, if your sample rate is 20kHz, and you play a 12kHz tone, you will not hear 12kHz, because your Nyquist Frequency is 10kHz. But, instead, you will hear what is known as aliasing, or foldover. What ends up happening is that a frequency at an equal distance below the NF as was recorded above will be added to the analog signal, or it will alias in to the analog signal. Therefore, if your Nyquist Frequency is 10kHz, a 12kHz signal will alias, or foldover, at 8kHz.  I know I went way off topic, but tl;dr Samples are the time concept of a digital representation of an analog waveform."

audioengineering,3dt4io,SubmarineAutopilot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:25:48 2015 UTC,"Hey dude,   If the noise is coming from the pedal I don't think a compressor is going to be able to help reduce noise. There is something inside your pedal board; it could be a pedal is being over driven, there is some kind of electric magnetic interference, or ground loop.  Compressors just control the loudness of a signal by turning it down in relation to how loud it gets. For example, past the threshold, for every 3 db of level, output 1 db of signal. This compressors the signal, and dynamic range of the instrument.  If the signal is already getting over driven/noisy, it doesn't matter how much you compress it, the noise is already in the signal.    Noise gate may help, but won't reduce the underlying problem. If you're lucky enough for the noise to be much lower than the signal, you can set the gate to turn off the signal between your noise and your guitar. Gates work by turning off the signal while it is below a threshold. For example, if the noise you are getting is at -50db, and the signal from you guitar is between -24 and -8 then you can set your gate to -40db, and that will automatically mute the channel when signal is below -40 db. Be aware the noise is still there, you just can't hear it over your guitar.  Does that make sense?"

I like a low kick, so 40hz or so is a good starting frequency to my ears. Gate this channel, and set the key filter on the gate to whatever channel your kick drum is in. If you take the time to adjust the gate settings to taste, you can get a TON of control over the sound of your kick drum with this trick.  Edit: u/jd_beats is right too!! Taking time to tune that sine wave to the song works great. I mix live, not studio, with different bands and material every week, and I run monitors, FOH, and lights all at the same time for every show. I'm usually too busy to tune the kick drum for every song, so I forgot to mention to tune the sine wave. :)"
audioengineering,3drxe2,somecallmemrjones,9,Sat Jul 18 22:18:41 2015 UTC,"If you do this, make sure you take the time to do one of two things:  A) figure out the exact frequency of the base note for the song's key signature and use that, or an octave harmonic of that, instead of just a random frequency For example, if the song is in C, use 32.7Hz or 65.41Hz. Song is in G use 49Hz, etc... (This isn't the best thing for the tone/beef of the kick drum itself, but the unity of frequencies between the song and the drum will improve the clarity of everything slightly.)  B) figure out (as accurately as possible) the exact frequency that your kick drum is making and use that, or an octave harmonic of that, instead of a random frequency.  (Easy alternative here is buying a sub-kick and micing with that to truly capture the sub frequencies your kick drum is making.  But either way, making sure you're adding to the relevant frequencies of your drum will absolutely help it stand out in the mix better than just plugging whatever frequency you feel like).  After either A or B, make sure the sine wave track is in phase with your kick drum track!!  Either of these things will go a long way towards improving the mix in comparison."
audioengineering,3drxe2,jd_beats,4,Sun Jul 19 07:43:33 2015 UTC,"FYI subkicks aren't really capturing some low frequencies your mic is missing.

audioengineering,3drxe2,Sinborn,2,Sun Jul 19 12:18:29 2015 UTC,"Sub-kicks are literally reverse wiring a large speaker to be an actual microphone great at picking up sub-frequencies. Sure, it's not technically picking up something your other kick mics aren't, but that's not the point. They are made to be a specialized kick drum input channel that focuses on the low frequencies, allowing you to mix the extra sub in to your heart's desire without having to EQ the main track heavily.   Whether or not they're super accurate mics isn't that important because it doesn't have to be.  It works in the same vein as adding a sub-frequency sine wave to add beef to your kick, except it doesn't require you to do any thinking to figure out which frequency you should use.   Edit: my points on ease of use still stand, but Sinborn and Hard6Rollin are correct that the subkick just oscillates at it's own frequency."
audioengineering,3drxe2,jd_beats,2,Sun Jul 19 14:30:44 2015 UTC,"I've made one and I use it for band practice to augment my kick.  I used a lame 8"" car sub in an equally lame 8"" tom.

audioengineering,3drxe2,Sinborn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:42:26 2015 UTC,"Might sound about the same to your ears, but the recorded wave form would be very different between an actual kick drum and just hitting it. I've edited enough drum tracks with a subkick track among them to know that for sure.   And also, the most useful part is that it's recording simultaneously with your other mic, so you aren't having to do the shit loads of work that can potentially go into sampling or side chaining a sine wave generator and getting it to sound right and trigger at the right moments.  With a subkick, you can spend far less time on processing your kick drum to sound the way you want it to. The ease of use, regardless of the accuracy of the recording, is what makes a subkick very useful."
audioengineering,3drxe2,jd_beats,2,Sun Jul 19 17:54:37 2015 UTC,"I commented elsewhere in regards to this, but /u/sinborn is correct. Sub kicks oscillate at the speakers resonant frequency and do not magically pick up sub bass frequencies that your other mics are somehow not hearing. Here is an excellent article from sound on sound that goes into detail on this matter.   I'm not doubting the fact that you get good results with your sub kick, they're useful tools. I just thought you'd like to know how they actually work. It will help you make better sub kicks in the future."
audioengineering,3drxe2,Hard6Rollin,2,Mon Jul 20 14:53:58 2015 UTC,"After either A or B, make sure the sine wave track is in phase with your kick drum track!!   Or you can high-pass or use a subtractive bell filter to cut back the kick at the frequency of the generator."
audioengineering,3drxe2,fuzeebear,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:41:42 2015 UTC,"Hell, if it came down to it, the most accurate way would be to bus the sine-wave generator to a new track and make a small sample which could then be added over the kick manually or sound replaced on a copied track. This way you could still gate it to the kick but be sure the start of each transient would be phase aligned right.   Either way, in my opinion it's better to be intentional about phase aligning, than to avoid it all together. lol"

Sub kicks do not work like this, they are much more like the gated sine wave trick than you may think. When the impulse of the kick drum excites the sub kick, it will quickly revert to oscillating like a sine wave at the speakers resonant frequency. No matter what the kick sounds like, the sub kick will always only produce the sine of its Fs when excited."
audioengineering,3drxe2,Hard6Rollin,2,Mon Jul 20 14:44:35 2015 UTC,"Wasn't thinking about it from a live stand point... fair enough!  You're right that there's not enough time or enough continuity between drummers/drum sets to tune the sine wave live.  Sub kick would be great here, but plugging practically any sub frequency through huge subs would definitely work to make sure the crowd is feeling it, so in that application you're spot on... just find one that seems decent in the room and roll with it!"

audioengineering,3drxe2,pl4yswithsquirrels,7,Sat Jul 18 22:09:44 2015 UTC,This is more compression on the master buss than side chaining. The kick is breathing with the rest of the track.

audioengineering,3drxe2,pl4yswithsquirrels,2,Sun Jul 19 19:11:35 2015 UTC,"Kick is cranked louder than everything else in the mix so the comp slams down on its signal.

Another way to do it is by automating the volume on the track or tracks you want to have react. In the case of a full song, have your kick on one bus, and the rest of your material on another. Automate the volume in something like a reverse saw wave pattern with every kick."

audioengineering,3ds6ny,iscreamuscreamweall,3,Sat Jul 18 23:22:30 2015 UTC,"The short answer is that both would be great podcasting mics.   In both cases, you'll need a LOT of clean gain from your preamp. Most inexpensive desktop USB interfaces do NOT have enough gain to give a sufficient signal from the SM7B on speaking voice. The easy solution to that is to buy a ""Cloudlifter CL1"" from Cloud Microphones. This will give you about 20dB additional gain no matter what preamp or interface you use (assuming it provides phantom power, which 99% of mic preamps do).  Do a google search for ""Best Budget Audio Interfaces for SM7B"" to read all about this topic, if you want more info, or just save yourself a lot of time and buy a Cloudlifter.  As to which mic would sound better on your voice, there's only 1 person in the world who can answer that: you. It's your voice, and your ears, and your perception of what you want to sound like that matters.  Because 5 minutes spent with these two mics in person will tell you 100 times more than any third-party opinion, I recommend you find a local recording studio or voice actor who has either or both of these mics. Rent the mic for an hour and try it yourself. It will cost you $50, but that's better in the long run than buying a mic you don't like (IMO).  FWIW, I tested both these mics, plus the RE-320, Sennheiser MD-421, Beyer M99, Shure SM57, Heil PR-30, and other high-quality dynamic mics on my own voice in a review called the ""Ultimate Podcasting Mic Shootout."" It includes audio samples at various distances, so you can hear the difference in proximity effect yourself. You can also listed blind to all these microphones to see which one you like on my voice (which, admittedly, might not mean you'd like it on your voice).   I am in general a big fan of Shure -- the people, the products, the punishing QC process they put every microphone through, the honesty in their specifications -- so it pains me to say that the SM7B is not the right mic for me. I own one and try it periodically to see if my tastes have changed. I own the RE-20 and RE-320 too, and like them both. But my go-to voice mic is the Beyerdynamic M99. It's harder to use than the others, but in its sweet spot is magic on my voice.   As to the question of whether to buy a dynamic or condenser microphone, I always recommend dynamics for podcasting unless two things are true:  1- you have a quiet, treated room to record in 2- you have enough broadcast experience to not constantly P-pop when you speak 3- you can afford a condenser that won't exaggerate ""ess"" sounds  Condenser mics will hear much more of the room than dynamics, so it is critical that the room is isolated and treated. Your podcast subscribers don't want to hear your HVAC, your neighbor's dog, or your own voice bouncing around the bedroom.   Also, most cheap condenser mics are way too bright/hyped/peaky to be tolerable for podcasts. I have another review on this topic, ""best $200 podcasting condenser microphones."" It identifies the more neutrally voiced mics in that price range. But I'd still take an RE-20 or M99 or, frankly, any good dynamic ahead of a cheap condenser if I'm recording my voice.  I apologize for writing a novel here. I've invested a few hundred hours into this topic and have come to some hard-earned conclusions. Also, I really really hate listening to bad-sounding podcasts."

audioengineering,3ds6ny,insaneinthecrane,2,Mon Jul 20 13:45:47 2015 UTC,"while these are both good microphones, I prefer the re-20 as it sounds more natural and linear to my ears and tends to be a little less honky and sibilant."
audioengineering,3ds6ny,EvoX650,2,Sun Jul 19 12:13:21 2015 UTC,"I own both and have tried them on a number of different sources. They are very similar, but with a few differences. The SM7b is a big, smooth, dark mic, with a good level of detail for a dynamic. People say it is quite flat, but I hear it as being a bit on the dark and heavy side, with some emphasis in the low-end. There is a presence boost which gives it more ""SM57-ness"" but generally, it's not nearly as grainy as its SM57 or SM58 cousins.  The RE20 is similar to the SM7b, but less heavy in the low end (perhaps because in its design, it is not affected by proximity effect very much), and there is a subtle but unique 'bump' in the mids (somewhere between 1k and 2k I think) that gives this mic its character. It's not very extreme, but it's there, and audible on most sources you record with it. It gives a spoken voice that sort of 'radio sound' that has made the mic so recognizable. This unique midrange is usually what makes or breaks it on a source.  The RE20 is a little easier to work with though, because proximity is not much of an issue. Between the two, I'd choose the SM7b, but I'd be splitting hairs, since they are both great microphones. I think the internet satirist Maddox has a podcast that, as far as I can remember, is usually 2-3 men recorded with RE20's. It might give you a good idea as to how male spoken word sounds with an RE20.  edit:changed 'condenser' to 'dynamic'"
audioengineering,3ds6ny,EvoX650,2,Sun Jul 19 18:29:02 2015 UTC,"in its design, it is not affected by proximity effect very much   Does this mean the mic will sound similar whether I am 10 inches away or 3 inches away?  (Whereas the sound difference would be more pronounced with the SM7B?)"
audioengineering,3ds6ny,nilsph,3,Sun Jul 19 19:10:05 2015 UTC,"Right, that is indeed the case. Of course, being 10 inches away will give you a bit more of the room in your sound among other things, but in terms of the bassiness of the sound, it'll be roughly the same. The SM7b does not exhibit bad proximity effect in any way though, I find that it tends to thicken up fairly nicely while using it close. In many ways, the proximity effect can be a helpful tool just as much as it can potentially be a hindrance. With untrained vocalists or hip hop vocals, where the performer tends to move around or likes to get right up on the mic, the RE20 can be very useful because it won't dramatically change like other mics can."

audioengineering,3ds6ny,tcookc,2,Sun Jul 19 21:23:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry, accidentally clicked submit on my phone. Sensible replacements for RE20 and SM7b might include Sennheiser MD421, Shure SM58 or Neumann BCM705. Those are all decent to high quality dynamic mics  The AT2020 is a condenser mic. Replacing the RE20 or SM7b with any condenser will be a DRAMATIC change in sound. I specifically use my RE20 on rock vocals when I DON'T want the hiss and noise of a condenser. There are other applications where I might specifically WANT the added sensitivity of a condenser. For example, if I wanted to record a very ""breathy"" vocal, where you could hear every inhale and exhale of the vocalist ... then I would want any condenser over RE20 or SM7b.  Saying that the AT2020 is specifically a good replacement for RE20 or SM7b makes no sense, because there is nothing to distinguish AT2020 from any other condenser. If you're going to replace a high end dynamic with any cheap condenser, why not buy something from MXL, CAD, Rode, AKG Perception or 214, ... or a million other options?  Very high end studios choose to use the RE20 and SM7b on certain vocal tracks, even when they have much more expensive condenser (Sony C800G, Neumann U87, ) and ribbon mics available. Why? Because they like the specific character of a dynamic mic in those situations.  Suggesting the AT2020 as a substitute for RE20 or SM7b has nothing to do with actual audio or production qualities ... it's just a matter of price and accessibility. The AT2020 is cheap and easy to find. It's a popular vocal mic for home studios, just like SM7b is a popular vocal mic for home studios. But they sound nothing alike."

audioengineering,3ds6ny,iscreamuscreamweall,3,Sun Jul 19 02:23:10 2015 UTC,Ok.  so that graph is a diagram of the frequency response of the two microphones.  It shows what frequencys are boosted and cut in the microphone design.  The purple line for example (the RE20) has a boost from around 5k to up around 11k meaning it will have a bit more brightness to it.  They both have a similar Hi-Midrange response.  The SM7b has a slight dip in the midrange so it may come off sounding slightly less warm than the RE20.  All in all they are both good mics and both are used in very similar circumstances (broadcasting)  My experience with the RE20 is that it has a real nice proximity effect to it.
audioengineering,3ds6ny,fuzeebear,3,Sun Jul 19 02:33:18 2015 UTC,I've had the opposite experience with the RE20. I've heard almost no proximity effect from it.
audioengineering,3ds6ny,iancwishlist,2,Sun Jul 19 08:07:40 2015 UTC,i think that was the original selling point of the mic actually. that it has a greatly reduced proximity effect.

audioengineering,3drgnd,hitthisbowl,2,Sat Jul 18 19:15:56 2015 UTC,"Your last point, I'll address in a new post.  You are confusing presets with plugins.  Nobody here told you not to use plugins.  The difference between the emulation of hardware is the hardware it self.  Often, waves, uad, etc get the actual hardware, run signal, and use Fast Fourier Transforms, or very fast math equations to analyze the resulting output.  They do this many times in order to create an algorithm that can apply that same result to different signals.  Understand, a plug in isn't a preset.  The presets aren't changing the way a signal is processed, just the position of the knobs of that plugin.  Emulation isn't stupid, presets are.  Lastly, engineers choose one eq over another for a variety of reasons.   All that stuff is hand made and thus a nut different.  Some comps are tube, which sound a certain way, and some are opto, which is different methods of accomplishing the same goal.  As such, they yield different results.   If you want to understand the different gear, study it electronically."

audioengineering,3drgnd,SuperRusso,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:47:52 2015 UTC,"I think I should point out that the EQ presets I was curious about change the EQ and saturation response curves but not the gain or gain reduction on any of the knobs. In that sense, it's a fundamentally different type of EQ I'd be using. This is why I think it's pretty analogous to separate plugin emulations (and, in a certain sense, synth presets).   Edit: Going back and checking, it looks like the gain/gain reduction is changed on the presets with a frequency range in their name (ie Millenium 5k) and the presets that are, by name, designed to alter the sound (ie Freshmaker). The presets without a frequency range in their name (ie N 1081), however, still hold up to my original point (and these were the ones I was curious about)."

Hard to tell with the reverb on top of it, but it sounds like there are some pretty nasty-ish reflections underneath. I would also high pass them a little a bit higher, I think the bass frequencies in the vocals are getting in the way. The mix is pretty good. I think I would lower the vocals towards the middle a tad. The guitars sound cool for the most part, but they're pretty thin around 2:50; perhaps add more tracks, with a bit more gain and bass? Hi hat is a little tinny, but that may not be readily fixable I suppose."

One thing I read and have been meaning to try for a cheap vocal room is recording in the backseat of a car: you get sound isolation (suspension), dampening (lots of thick foam in seats) and walls that aren't parallel.

I like mixing acoustics so that most of what you hear is the pick attack and upper harmonics (filling in the space left by other instruments), but with them playing a lead role here you can probably be fairly moderate in your eq. Also, a bit of compression on the master would help glue things together nicely. Snare could come up a bit. Bass could come up a bit more.  Pretty cool!"

Unfortunately, the most detailed descriptions of how to use EQ and compression still can't give you all the skills to actually HEAR the changes being made. You need to have the ear to find the issue, the knowledge to fix that issue, and then again the ear to confirm that the issue has been solved with as little compromise to the rest of the sound as possible. All of this takes practice and time, as in years and years worth.   The easiest way to get started working on your ears is to pick a nob, turn it all the way to the left, all the way to the right, and really, really listen and try to get a feel for how that nob changes the sound as well as what sounds best to you. If you play with a particular process enough, you can eventually start to anticipate what your changes are going to sound like before you even apply them.

audioengineering,3drmh0,roylurr,2,Sat Jul 18 23:20:52 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're talking about post production audio. Typically, the dialogue editor will use very subtle compression on dialogue. This means low ratios and high thresholds (there should be a meter on your compressor that shows how subtle or obvious the compression is). EQ (if talking about dialogue) is about the space that the scene is in. With audio, you can't rely on numbers or settings; you always have to use your ears. Look on YouTube specifically for what you are EQing i.e. ""dialogue EQ and compression"". Good luck!"

It's a great way to give your treatment some originality.  I've found sometimes the frame of the canvas isn't big enough to fit the foam, for example, if you needed more absorption, but it's easy to discretely add wood pieces on to the frame.   Theatre curtains are an AWESOME way to treat a room just because you can treat the room to be acoustically pleasing then slide the curtains over the wall if you want to dampen the room more! Not to mention their general association with 'ShowBiz'  And as far as lighting in a studio I strongly believe it should strictly be LEDs and here's why! They don't give off heat the way practicals do and you can find some really neat, inexpensive, LED technology that will flash to the peaks of the sound in the room. Maybe use this once in a blue moon when you're alone but when you have clients over its just another ""oooo-aaaaaa"" feature adding to the 'studio magic'. Much like Vegas mode .-.

These days ""gain staging"" can be reduced to ""don't clip it... unless you meant to"".   Any nonsense about summing being better with headroom, that doesn't involve clipping, you can disregard.  If you will be sending the mixes to a mastering engineer, then you may want to send them a) your reference hot/limited/compress mix b) a mix without any master buss stuff.     Some mastering engineers get really testy about having headroom, so you might as well leave them some. Although I can't for the life of me figure out why they don't just turn the track down if they need more headroom.   anyways.

Clipping in a DAW tends to sound pretty awful, and turning everything down just leads to a higher noise floor. Make sure you're somewhere in the middle and you're good.   Things like these are essential to know, but once you understand them, it's really just about the mix process. Your taste is what I think makes a more progressional recording. If you're over compressing things, that's probably what makes it sound bad. Just listen to what the mix needs rather than putting a compressor on every track."

As long as your interface isn't faulty the noise floor in any DAW is neglible, even running at 16bit.

audioengineering,3dpc2k,MixLA,-3,Sat Jul 18 18:45:08 2015 UTC,"Forget ""hot"". Forget ""loud"". Those two things are figments of your imagination. They don't actually exist.  Because you can't control the listener's volume level, stop trying to get your master to be ""hot"", and worry more about it sounding GOOD."
audioengineering,3dpc2k,DuraMorte,5,Sat Jul 18 10:56:18 2015 UTC,"I really wish you were right but unfortunately that's not the case.  If your, or your client's, music sounds quiet when leading into or coming after another louder track your music will sound weak. It's a psychological fact (as well as being a psychoacoustical trick! Stupid brain!).  As a f/t mastering engineer I'm hearing a lot more recent releases not going for the last couple of dBs in loudness at the expense of tonal quality and are now settling for being as loud as possible without distorting (or making adjustments for loudness). For the most past I think we're probably past the loudness wars but we'll never get back to pre-loudness levels... at least until loudness normalisation is on every service and device by default. Could be a looooong time off!"
audioengineering,3dpc2k,3gaydads,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:23:43 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter how much quieter Billie Jean is compared to the latest and greatest. I have been leaving the -8 rms dbfs world for the last few years. I don't have to do much to get any track to -12 -14 and the music is better for it.   Our clients want to be competitive, I understand that. However, a super hot master is never what stands between them and success. I don't see any reason why tracks have to get to -8 and beyond."
audioengineering,3dpc2k,lord_bunny,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:24:13 2015 UTC,I think streaming services will spread loudness normalisation quicker than we might expect. I wonder what the norm is going to be though.
audioengineering,3dpc2k,jajohu,-4,Sat Jul 18 13:47:35 2015 UTC,"What crazy world do you live in where people leave their volumes at the same level all the time?  If it's too quiet, people will turn it up. If it's loud as hell, they turn it down. The volume knob is usually the biggest knob on a stereo for a reason..."
audioengineering,3dpc2k,DuraMorte,2,Sat Jul 18 14:01:24 2015 UTC,"So when you're watching TV and the commercials are way too loud, and you have to be constantly holding the remote so you don't get blasted - you don't mind? I don't believe you. We can't honestly expect listeners to have to adjust the volume for every song that comes on, especially when we can fix it so easily."
audioengineering,3dpc2k,JimNear,2,Sat Jul 18 15:40:04 2015 UTC,"If that was the thought process, I wouldn't have to put up with YouTube subscription lists having music way too loud and vlogs too soft to hear.  As penance, they're supposed to be using an algorithm to correct it, which nobody will like and now everybody loses.  As for TV commercials, there's a law now."
audioengineering,3dpc2k,chunter16,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:58:40 2015 UTC,"True, but YT is user created content, and not subject to the same industry standards as professional film or music. Changes within a video's sound is the result of this, and there really isn't anything we can do, besides encouraging content creators not to blast us or offer volume warnings where necessary. Currently, they're not regulating audio within the same video, only bringing ones with low peak levels up, typically old songs. Nobody noticed YT's volume normalization until they announced they had been doing it for months. Nobody noticed in any of the billions of views that happened during that time, and everyone who complains about it now is listening with their eyes. Its not compression, and its not affecting quality, so its really an everybody wins scenario. As for TV commercials, the last I checked we still don't have the law about normalization where I am, but I bought a TV that does it anyways, so it might have gone through without me noticing. On a side note, my TV is different than YT as it adds a touch of compression when it normalizes, and the difference is negligible. I was expecting it to squash my shows and movies, but it sounds great.  Really what I was referring to was his ""big knob"" point, where its expected of people to change the volume when necessary. Understandable, but now you're throwing a house party, and have to keep your hand on your big knob the entire time. You can't take your hand off the dial to go grab a drink, because the song might change and rattle the pictures off the wall. I wanted to point out that mastering a song at say -10 Db RMS instead of 0 Db is not a very difficult thing to do, and almost everybody will agree it sounds better. Like YT, this issue is commonly due to amatuerism of the producer, and like TV commercials, its often due to the need to stand out. Audio engineering is an art form just like playing music. It happens to have a good deal of science involved, but it still an art, and very personalized. Since artists are so stubborn about their art, and can never seem to accept even the smallest of suggestions or critisism, I think that app based normalization might be the only way to go. As long as its not a harsh compressor, I gaurantee no one will mind."

audioengineering,3do7ng,NJlo,2,Fri Jul 17 22:46:45 2015 UTC,any more info on this?
audioengineering,3do7ng,bootynuggets,3,Fri Jul 17 23:57:55 2015 UTC,"Aphex USB 500 rack. Seems like a good idea, but not much room for expansion (no ADAT ports) and it's only 4-slot.  Still a great idea if all you need is an interface with 4 preamps, or two preamps with EQ, or a single ""ultimate"" channel strip. But at that point I would rather have a 6-slot rack and a separate, decent 4- or 2-channel interface."
audioengineering,3do7ng,fuzeebear,4,Sat Jul 18 00:20:46 2015 UTC,On something like this I would also be wary of the conversion quality..
audioengineering,3do7ng,sawwaveissharp,2,Sat Jul 18 01:35:52 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. I would too, but I'm willing to bet it's on par with most of the audio interfaces in the $250-450 range. Even the cheaper stuff seems to be closing the gap, and in most cases my biggest concern with audio interfaces is the quality of the analog components.  Of course this is all guesswork based on the level of quality I've seen in other Aphex devices. So I can't say for the 500 rack with any degree of certainty.  I've avoided the issue of subpar conversion, clocking, and analog components by switching to RME."
audioengineering,3do7ng,fuzeebear,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:49:32 2015 UTC,"Aphex isn't a company known for the quality of it's converters.  I would stay far away from that rack.  In fact, I believe that Sweetwater recently blew those 500 series rack out as they really weren't selling."
audioengineering,3do7ng,Shnittengruben,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:57:42 2015 UTC,"2 stereo bus compressors maybe... But yeah, a bigger rack would be a lot better."
audioengineering,3do7ng,NJlo,3,Sat Jul 18 00:35:51 2015 UTC,"Imagine if it was an 8-slot, but also took an ADAT input. That means you could add an 8-channel preamp (focusrite Octopre, Midas xl48,whatever) and use it as a 16-preamp front-end for your DAW."
audioengineering,3do7ng,fuzeebear,3,Sat Jul 18 00:41:23 2015 UTC,"So I have a Purple Audio Sweet Ten, 6 slots full, still working on building a preamp and looking at just buying my first compressor, but want to build one too like the other pres I have.     I have a rack setup so I can travel with the Sweet Ten, a dual effects unit and my AD converters. The short of it is that I have a TRS patchbay. So when I'm tracking, I can route however I want, and when I am mixing or finishing songs (I don't have a mastering suite, I don't have a mastering suite, I don't have a mastering suite; so I don't say I do mastering).     I know it's overkill, but with the patchbay I can track to tape the channel strip I want, any stage in it (so I can put the preamp on a track, the preamp --> eq on a track, preamp --> eq --> effects, you get the idea).  I also have an older 8-channel 1U addition. Sooo the long way around, if I want really complicated channel strips, such as if I'm just tracking a guitar and vocalist, or if I need a whole array of preamps, I have what I need.     Edit: Remember that 500 series is just like any other piece of equipment. You can go with whatever size you might want. So if you are hazy still, buy the Lindell ( I have a friend who likes his) 503 and load that down first. If you still like the idea of 500 series gear, sell the 503 or don't, and buy a bigger rack. Happy Tracking and Mixing"
audioengineering,3do7ng,ClemBurmingham,2,Sat Jul 18 05:31:06 2015 UTC,"Whoa I didn't even know they made a 3 space. That's even cooler! I think that'll probably be the way I go. Just out of curiosity, what kind of AD converters do you use and how are they connected to the patch bay?  Edit: And also, what kind of DA? I'm trying to clarify in my mind how exactly to piece together a more complicated rig than a basic interface + other stuff. I keep seeing things like the Antelope Orion show up but the specifics of hooking something like that up to some other monitor controller/patch bay/snake elude me."
audioengineering,3do7ng,ClemBurmingham,2,Sat Jul 18 05:42:27 2015 UTC,"Patching is just something I had to get a feel for, so I am probably not the best at explaining. Years ago when I bought the patch bays as a young and dumb kid, I looked up hook-up diagrams, set up my ins and outs in normal, half-normals, thrus, and mults (shun the multer). Life happens, I remove the patch bays until they might be useful. Right now I'm using a MOTU 16a because at the time of purchase I just needed converters. If I had the time and money I would have gone with a UAD Apollo 16 or something similar with much much more dsp. That doesn't mean I don't like my 16a, it's a great little unit, but more suited to my live recordings and what not.   It isn't the most desirable setup, but right now everything on the main patch bay I'm using is set as thru-puts (top and bottom connections are not connected unless you run a cable from top to bottom).     Think of a patch bay as a small patch cable between your ins and outs. So a small run of cable between the xlr coming out of a mic, and then the small cable is what is inserted into the preamp. Then think about that all over your system. A small patch cable between the effect outs or auxes of your unit to effects, small patch cables between your main outputs to the cable running to your speakers.     Let's ignore the patch bay. How do I use the Sweet Ten and the MOTU 16a in my setup? I route mics to pres of course, and then the outputs on the back of the ST to the ins on the MOTU. The MOTU does its AD in, see it in my DAW, route the output of my master to a couple of outs, usually my last two DA outs, 15 and 16. Those two channels then feed my speakers."

audioengineering,3do7ng,iancwishlist,2,Sat Jul 18 16:16:08 2015 UTC,I just built a ton of Classic API preamps and one of their 11space racks for my studio and we just racked it in with the rest of our other pres. It's just connected to our patchbay with everything else and get tons of use.
audioengineering,3do7ng,Shnittengruben,2,Sat Jul 18 03:49:55 2015 UTC,"Did you go with VPR or 51x? What's the difference? Also, how much experience do you think is necessary to build the Classic pres? I took a few years of electronics class in highschool and never had any trouble putting together those boards. I usually install my own pickups in guitars and make all my own mic and instrument cables. Do you think that's sufficient experience or are there other projects that would be worth working up to a preamp with?"
audioengineering,3do7ng,soundvscience,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:23:46 2015 UTC,"The CAPI pres are dead simple to build. The only part that could be a bit tricky, depending on you skill/experience level, would be the OpAmps, if you go the DIY route, just because everything is so tightly packed together."
audioengineering,3do7ng,Shnittengruben,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:39:21 2015 UTC,The big question is how much TIME did it take to rack together a single 500 CAPI piece?  What about the rack itself (time)?  And then there's the PSU for the CAPI rack.  At one point I had the attention span to solder all this stuff together and these days I'm in a much more creative (instead of technical) headspace.  Time in DIY projects is often the biggest consideration to me now.
audioengineering,3do7ng,soundvscience,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:00:46 2015 UTC,A single CAPI VP26 takes about 2.5 hours if you know what you're doing.

audioengineering,3do7ng,idgaf_about_yr_imgur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:20:48 2015 UTC,"I went with the VPR rack. I built 11 of the Vp26s, and built the rack and power supply. The difference is just the modules that are made for each. VPR is currently more popular because of API pushing that style so well. 51x is more of the DIYer format, but some suspect that they may be the future of the lunchbox concept. It has more power and can therefore give you more power if you want to make modules that require it.  As far as experience, I had used my solder station 2 times before for fixing a cable and soldering a component. I had been around soldering a little bit from watching the tech at my studio repair our consoles, but had very little experience and still managed to make them all correctly first time around (minus switching 2 caps around on my last 2 modules). That being said, you probably have enough experience to knock them out.  They are not necessarily hard work. It comes with very clear instructions. You just have to be careful and take your time the first time around. I think the first one took me like 7 hours or something stupid long, and then the rest were 2.5 hours a piece. Building the rack and PSU was a little more involved, but just follow instructions and you'll get it knocked out. Those pieces took me about 13 hours to piece together total."

One is full of pres, the other is a mix of EQ and Dyn.  The lunchbox mentality is basically so that you can use them however you need/want to - you want to build a stereo signal path of your favourite pre/eq/dyn? Easy! You want a rack of comps for mixing? Cool! You want your essential tools to carry with you into other studios? Ideal!   I'm happy to give you some pointers, but it would be easier if you let me know what you want to do with it, rather than explaining all of the vast amount of permutations they can be configured in."
audioengineering,3do7ng,brute-squad,4,Sat Jul 18 11:19:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just use a snake from the box to your interface.  BTW, fuck the API lunchboxes. They supply enough power but are wimpy and more expensive than the Lindell Audio boxes which supply 400 mA per rack space. I also think the Lindell stuff is built sturdier. The only downside is that a 6-space isn't easily rackable in a full-size rack. Check 'em out."
audioengineering,3do7ng,sawwaveissharp,4,Fri Jul 17 23:39:22 2015 UTC,Noted! The Lindell ones looked pretty nice.

More connections, good power (265 mA versus API's 250), more features (feed and link switches, omniport).  Its about the same price as the 6-slot API lunchbox.... Weirdly enough, the 8-slot API lunchbox is cheaper.  Edit: neither are close to Lindell's power which is like 400 mA per slot."

Opamps should be socketed, so you could replace with high performance stuff if you wanted to. The circuitry should be pretty straightforward, easy to tweak/upgrade.  Obviously, it's not a hugely flexible board, but could be a perfectly serviceable submixer or somesuch.

audioengineering,3dnd24,Simultaneity,2,Fri Jul 17 18:36:42 2015 UTC,"Are you just splitting something into tracks, or will you be using the more advanced features such as subtracks?  In Audacity, it's surprisingly easy to split something into tracks.  I suggest using Burrrn to actually burn the discs, but any audio disc burner that lets you set a zero between-track gap will work.  If you plan to use the advanced features of CDs such as pregap and subtracks, you will need to write a CUE sheet and use a compatible software such as Burrrn or Nero to burn the disc."
audioengineering,3dnd24,RobinUrthos,3,Fri Jul 17 18:36:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  I'm not actually burning the disk - it's being sent through my label's distribution system.  So I need to be able to export an audio file (2 hours, the whole mix) that will play continuously but can also be skipped through and will function as such when they get pressed on the back end.  Possible?"
audioengineering,3dnd24,Eye_Decay,2,Fri Jul 17 19:13:37 2015 UTC,"This sounds really interesting, could you pm me a link when it drops?"
audioengineering,3dnd24,Eye_Decay,3,Fri Jul 17 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"sure! I realized the best way to do this is render each track in the mix from the appropriate points and coordinate directly with the pressing and duplication folks, bypassing distro entirely and letting them just handle the digital."
audioengineering,3dnd24,GwenCS,2,Fri Jul 17 21:13:29 2015 UTC,"That seems like it will work well enough. I've done a few DIY releases for my own and others' bands with the continuous play/overlapping track thing and I accomplished it relatively easy by importing all of the final tracks into one project (reaper and previously studio one 2.0) and after aligning them, using the ""export from selected region"" feature that both DAWs have. As long as the audio disc is marked for gapless playback it sounds nearly identical to other methods with the added benefit of being able to also normalize and master tracks simultaneously since they are all in the same project window. Hope everything turns out well for you!"
audioengineering,3dnd24,EvilPowerMaster,2,Fri Jul 17 21:54:14 2015 UTC,"Just a note, you can't fit a whole 2 hour mix on a CD, you'll have to split it somewhere."
audioengineering,3dnd24,Indie59,2,Sat Jul 18 00:59:58 2015 UTC,"Most of this seems to be answered, but one thing comes to mind from when I used to work for a music college.   We were recording primarily Jazz and Orchestral music, but some other things as well. As you can imagine, a lot of the classical was all one performance, with no gaps between movements. When we exported, no matter what we did, there would often be a slight blip when the track changed. As in you would hear the spot where it went from one track to the next, even if it was gapless playback. It didn't effect timing or tempo at all, it sounded almost like a clock error tick. Sometimes it was an inter-sample peak that would happen with some playback, and I have suspicions about it being basically one sample of noise inserted in between supposedly ""gapless"" playback.   Anyhow, we found one thing that worked every time.   We put the shortest possible fade out and back in on every track that was supposed to play gapless.   In ProTools the shortest fade we could do was four samples long. You can't hear the fade, but it got rid of every track change noise we ran into, so it just became standard procedure or add that unless you were putting in a longer fade (final track, or some such thing)."
audioengineering,3dnd24,EvilPowerMaster,2,Fri Jul 17 22:46:04 2015 UTC,"What you are referring to is caused by the edit creating a non-zero start and stop. By shearing a wave, you create basically a micro square wave. Each track defaults to a zero start (as a speaker cone cannot really start without the voice coil at rest) so a momentary gap is created between the broken wave points, which at that speed and energy, creates a transient pop.  You are correct that a fade will mitigate the problem, as will finding an edit point where the waveform is at a zero point in all channels (which isn't always possible.)"
audioengineering,3dnd24,BiigNiick,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:13:58 2015 UTC,"Well, in THEORY, if it's truly gapless, it shouldn't drop back to zero, but start where it left off at in the last track, but what you describe makes perfect sense."

I understand the general concept of sending tracks to different busses with various reverbs...but that's as far as my knowledge goes. Enlighten me!
audioengineering,3dmcew,12InchesLimp,5,Fri Jul 17 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"Most shoegaze arrangements employ large amounts of distortion and delay/reverd (along with pitch shifting and chorus) in order to create that ""wall of sound"" that is so popular within the genre.  In order to achieve such a large sound they will often string together 3 or 4 different distortion pedals (in a long chain of other effects) which creates that huge, yet very clean sound. I think the key with this style of music is finding the right effects chain that has a good balance of delay, pitch shift, and distortion (+ other effects to taste).  Here's a diagram of Neil Halstead's (frontman of Slowdive) guitars as well as the effects chain that he used (for stage set-ups during 1993): http://www.guitargeek.com/neil-halstead-slowdive-1993-guitar-rig-and-gear-setup-diagram/  This probably didn't answer your question at all but I figured I'd give some knowledge about shoegaze in general since I've been studying it.

I have a pretty long effects chain (stomp boxes) that gets good tone, but I might need to introduce another distortion/overdriver into the chain since I'm only using a big muff and tubescreamer.Thanks again!

audioengineering,3dmcew,evileyemusic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:35:41 2015 UTC,What type of pitch shifting are you referring to?
audioengineering,3dmcew,fresnohammond,3,Fri Jul 17 22:35:50 2015 UTC,"Also note that a lot of the guitar reverb is coming through the amps, mono or nearly mono, I can't quite tell. Comparatively much less reverb is delivered by mix effects in stereo.  It's always easier to make reverbs play nice when they're in mono.  Also, if you don't already, try sculpting your reverb returns in the mix with eq. Find a freq band where the reverb sounds great AND there's less ""important"" things going on in the mix. If you boost that band you can drop the overall reverb amount and carry the essence of the reverb without so much competition for space.  In my work I usually find a wide Q 6dB boost around 7kHz with a -6 or -12dB/8va lowpass around 10 to 11kHz works lovely. This is on the return. The send has a highpass to remove true bass, and a general ascending character. I prefer plates of moderate decay in most uses. Predelay is normally determined by tempo."
audioengineering,3dmcew,GwenCS,2,Fri Jul 17 22:35:24 2015 UTC,"Can't listen to it right now, but I imagine there's a lot of EQ carving going on to let the reverb fit in the mix. I'll give it a listen once I can get to my rig though."

There is a lot of synth work on that album, mainly from the VCS3 and Minimoog if I'm not mistaken.

In the below song, there is a ""simple"" saw + noise instrument from 0:57-1:00.  It is used through out the song, including at the climax.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSnZRpp83nc  Here is a screenshot of the spectrum at a relevant moment  http://i.imgur.com/MPGxWPV.png  I can tell there is a high pass (though my audio is ripped from youtube, his full quality releases actually have a high pass around 17k-18k).  I can tell there is a lot of noise that is pushing up in the higher spectrum, and the lower harmonics sound fairly clear.  But no matter what I do, I can't emulate that one sound.  I can't get nearly the brightness he has, or the shape he has to his saw wave.  I figure there is some compression stuff going on, but I haven't been able to figure that part out either.

The same basic principles apply to this that apply in any mix: Usually the reverb and effects is treated like any other instrument ... carving space for it .... making space in it etc...  For this type of music, thick on the reverb and reverb modulation but filter off the lows and carve space in it for the other instruments. Carve space from the other instruments for the reverb except the instruments you want washed up in the reverb.  Certain reverbs can help too for this style .. like Lexicon PCM70, 240 or 480 as they do some of the heavy lifting for you and come with a familiar sound. Only plugin that seems to work OK for this are the Valhalla ones. Sometime I send some of the reverb to a Dimension D to wash it out a little.  Good luck!"

audioengineering,3dnbqa,EJWatson,2,Fri Jul 17 17:46:07 2015 UTC,"I would like to know the answer to this also.  There is quite a lot of difference between Apple's AU Lab and Hosting AU. AU Lab apparently won't talk to my Tascam US-122L in ""bit-accurate"" mode, but core audio works fine. Hosting AU talks to the US-122L in ""bit-accurate"" mode, but stops talking to it as a core audio device after I make any changes such as adding an effect.  There is some latency, but not very much. It does not increase over time for me (Mavericks 10.9.5 on a Core i5 MacBook Pro). The prefs for AU Lab would seem to indicate that the buffer settings for the default output device are the source of the latency. I do not know how to change them.  If I want zero latency, I monitor the input directly on the US-122L with the monitor mix all the way to ""input"" versus ""computer"". Even without any effects, there is still enough latency on my Mac that I would not be able to use it for laying tracks or any other real-time application.  I'm not sure I understand what you are doing, but an external audio interface with a monitor output might help. Mine was $50 on CL. Add to that a cheap Behringer 1002FX so I can get reverb on the monitor mix, but NOT on the input to the Tascam (record dry; add effects later) and I am able to lay tracks quite well without worrying about latency."

I came to the more advanced technical forum because I can't find help anywhere else.  My interface is simple: I run a Chromecast from the back of my TV. I port out the audio from the TV output to the Mac, then out to my home stereo. There's no latency from the television itself (I can hook it into the speakers directly, with no problem). The delay is there only when running it through the Mac.  I can just port my input/output as ""thru,"" in my MIDI setup with very little latency. However for some reason the audio passes through my system before my equalizer/normalizer (I'm using Audio Hijack 3 now, which is incredible) can reach it. I'm not sure why, but hopefully it's something simple. I'm testing again all day today—will let you know if I come up with anything."

audioengineering,3dncsg,kent_eh,7,Fri Jul 17 18:14:36 2015 UTC,"What you're trying to do is actually really hard. ""N"" and ""S"" are both fricative consonants, meaning that air is flowing as each is pronounced (As opposed to a ""T"" or a ""B,"" where airflow stops). This means there's a kind of sliding overlap between the two sounds.  As suggested, it will help to fade out and in rather than cut it off, and you should zoom way in to select exactly where to make your cut and start your fade...however, it may not be possible to do this perfectly. Even if it were possible to make the edit, it's tough to change an actor's performance like this. Their inflection and tone will all sound funky, because you've changed the rhythm of the line. I routinely cut out dead space and long pauses, but that's about all I will do to an actor's performance.  One other thing to try: if the actor says the word ""In"" elsewhere or in another take with a pause immediately afterwards, try subbing that in for the word ""In"" in this line. Depending on how it was delivered, it may sound more natural than trying to make this one work."

An easy way to do this would be, say if you are looking at your audio waveform, and there is a moment of silence, you should be able to copy this length of silence and paste it into where you would like, just like copy/pasting text in a word document. I don't use Audacity so I'm not sure that will work 100%, but another option may be to locate the preferences screen (usually found by clicking 'File' at the top and scrolling down) - there should be something related to ""key functions"" or quick keys (not sure in Audacity) and you can search for ""silence"".

Usually theres a small foam inner, under the metal basket, so perhaps these two microphones lack one/have a very thin one. Putting a windscreen over the mic will suit it being handheld a bit better, as it can cope with your plosives coming from all directions. A pop filter will only be able to really reduce pops from one direction. Also, as I can imagine it doubles as a handheld microphone, it would be quite tricky to hold a pop filter whilst also holding the microphone. Thats all I can think of off the top of my head, but if you're putting it on a stand then I'd go down the pop shield route."

It's simply illustrating a concept, maybe exaggerating it deliberately for effect, and it shouldn't be taken at face value. But then that should be stated clearly IMO, rather than letting the experience of the viewers determine their belief in what they're hearing.  ... And no... If it's all done with one mic, even different mics in different locations, but just one mic per recording, we can make an assumption that the audio presents a rough approximation of the environment's natural acoustic properties, but if there's two or more mics in different positions then the positioning and the mix balance will absolutely effect the intensity of the reverberations in the final audio mix, and even, to an extent, the decay of the reverb. And the methodology of how they attempt to keep this uniform from location to location would have to be questioned also.  I get it that these guys aren't doing this for engineers, or scientific research, but it's only a minor step to take it to that level... So why not just do that? Why not take the extra time to plan and rig this so that each recording has the same methodology and calibration applied? Hell, I used to be a location sound guy and that was pretty much part of my work flow.  This was debated at length when the drummer video did the rounds and I really don't mean to go over it all again, for everybody's sake, but it does still irk me that they omitted these details. In the drummer vid, the noise floor changed dramatically, apparently with the dynamics of the performance, and so there appeared to be a deal of compression used to process the audio and faith in a realistic representation was shredded for me and a lot of others. I've only got my laptop with me today, not anywhere near decent monitors or cans, so I can't really verify the state of the audio in this video but I instantly question it...

You can hear the noise floor breathing on that video... That's not natural.  With additional information on their recording methodology, we could tell whether what we're hearing is indicative of reality or indicative of the mixing and recording practices they employ: With 2 lavs and 2 stereo pairs, as someone else found they say they use in the comments, they could be staging the mics differently for each location and so artificially extending the decay of the reverbs in some situations. Adding compression would also do this.  Without that information, we're taking things at face value, like believing the stunts we see in films are real.  I know I'm being a pedant...

And, as someone who's repeatedly worked with students, and even professionals with some critical gaps in their understanding, seeing some solid technical detail presented along with the illustration seems like the right way to approach spreading information, rather than ""This is what you can do, but we're not telling you how we did it"". That latter kind of approach results in people having unrealistic expectations and needing further/corrective education. And it's very hard to re-educate people, it's better to teach them properly in the first instance and try to avoid having to break bad habits or incorrect assumptions at a later date.  The point of accurate education is, of course, so that when it does come time for students to fly solo, they have a decent amount of chance of making informed guesses at the methodology and practices, rather than having to work it out from scratch on their own which would often be debilitating. Not that students shouldn't experiment or work things out for themselves, they absolutely should, but they shouldn't have to contend with false impressions in the first place unless they're specifically being used to illustrate how perception can be colored. Why handicap them like that before letting them try it for themselves?  So I guess my annoyance isn't specific to this being an audio engineering topic, but that the video falls short as an accurate source of information by omitting some salient points, and so has questionable educational merit other than to illustrate that, yes, different places sound different. Just like they also look different. That just feels somewhat pointless to me.  Even the inclusion, in the description of the video, of ""No artificial reverb added"" seems to me to be trying to lend authenticity to the results while avoiding the, arguably more important, detail of how the audio was captured and processed. Typical video production mentality, somewhat akin to magic/illusion... I'd rather a documentary approach than an entertainment or advertisement approach. It seems, not quite dishonest... Maybe, underhanded? Deliberately vague? Lazy?  If this truly was meant to illustrate the effect of environment on acoustics, reverb and recording practices, then the camera work would not be as concerned with visual continuity, matched framing and positioning (hey look... They took the effort to do it with the camera and lighting gear, why not the audio gear?), they'd have shot it wider and shown the audio workflow.  Like I said, it's not specifically for me. The majority of my recording history was not in studios, but on location, and so I have about as much experience as I need to get the results I want from natural reverb and blending close mics with a distanced mics to provide a sense of space and environment, the methodology seemingly used in this video.  Sorry about the wall of text.  Quick edit: BTW, thank you for discussing this maturely and asking me questions... It's so easy for people to get shitty when they disagree or miss someone else's viewpoint."

audioengineering,3di9n8,hellafarious,2,Thu Jul 16 22:32:15 2015 UTC,"That was minorly cute, but I don't get the split-screen parts where it is just the one voice. Were they applying different reverb to each stereo channel?  Also, it seems like the audio segments are too well matched for it to have been recorded live in each location. No wind noise or other ambient sound. I would think that the singer would have some difficulty adjusting to an outdoor environment.  Seems like the smart way of doing the video would be to record the whole song in the anechoic chamber, then play it back and re-record it in each of the locations. Then have the performer in front of a green screen and composite him into the various backgrounds. There was some lack of synchronization in the video, so they probably did not do that.  Does anybody have more details on how it was made?"

Its easy to drive, and (mostly) makes sense.  BUT, the EQ is horrendous, as are the rack FX. I don't think I've ever experienced equipment where patching & enabling an EQ (channel PEQ or rack GEQ) without touching a single thing alters the sound SO MUCH for the worse.    Try it. Listen to speech or something through it. Switch in the channel eq. Sounds totally different. Try patching in a GEQ (on the channel or master, w/e), but dont switch it on. Listen again. Then patch it in.  Drastically different!  but its $3000. and it has a lot of features. If you want tools, get an X32.

I often have better results with a small 10ch analogue desk and a BSS Opal GEQ.  However, I'm normally using the x32 because I need more functionality than a 10ch console, but budget doesn't warrant a Pro1. In which case I'm quite happy to have the x32. It's either that or an LS9. And altho the LS9 is better sounding, the x32 is a much more modern console, with much better features.  But sound is very objective. I see the x32 as a trade-off. It's useable, but there are much better things out there. Perhaps not with the bang-for-buck. but I wouldn't want to only use x32s!"

If most people will be listening to a stereo sum/truncation of the 5.1 mix, then just do a normal stereo mix (lead vocal kick snare bass dead centre) and use the surrounds for some fx returns (the mix takes place in front of you but still envelopes you 360 degrees). LFE should be fed from sends off the individual channels, generally just kick and/or bass and/or any other sub-bass information.

The big guys' monitors were upwards of $3000 for the pair, maybe a lot more on some Genelec monitors... medium sized studios usually spent around $1000 on a decent pair like some Focal Spirits or Yamaha H/HS series.

The compression features are nice too, I use them when watching movies at night ;)"

When you know you have data that needs to be kept, it's simple to use your normal file management tools to copy the last few segment files to another directory and perhaps concatenate them in to one file if necessary.

I will also recommend eqing your secondary takes.  take out some of the low end maybe up to 125 hz and bring out some of the low mids so as you aren't clogging up those frequency ranges in the whole mix.  in addition, compress each vocal channel getting no more than 3 db of gain reduction, and then bus all the vocal channels to a vocal bus, then adding another compressor on the bus, again not getting more than 3db of compression.  from there i would have an aux send from the vocal bus go into a reverb.  and a second aux go into a short delay.  mix those to taste.  that should really fatten up your vocal track."

Did the producer say this or is this your opinion from just playing your raw vocals along with the track? If it's the latter, don't worry. It's the producers job to mix your vocals in and make everything sound cohesive and complete. As long as your raw vocals are in tune and free of any glaring faults they should be fine to work with.

Regardless of how you eventually record your guitar, that 5150 is a good amp that is essentially timeless. It will sound good in 10, 25, 50 years if it is properly maintained. Any amp sim you buy today will eventually sound dated. Do not sell the 5150 just to buy the Line 6 Pod. I made similar mistakes myself, selling real amps and pedals for Line 6 modelers before I went off to grad school. Big regrets here.   Having said all that, it's difficult to say whether it will be easier to get the tones you want with a real 5150 and SM57 versus an amp sim. I play punk and use a mixture of real amps (Marshall, Orange) and mics (SM57, MD421, ribbons, condensers) with amp sims (Logic). I typical record 2-3 signals per take for my main guitar tracks: a DI track that I use for amp sims plus 1-2 different mic'd amps. If I'm adding a 3rd or 4th guitar track, it's usually all amp sim for convenience's sake.  Personally, I love the sound of amp sims for clean to low gain amps: Blackface Fenders, Vox AC30 Top Boost, etc. High gain stuff definitely takes more work with amp sims, IMO. Flat sound and fizziness are the usual complaints. I've heard some engineers fix the problem by using massive amounts of overdubs or duplicated tracks, each with slight variations in the EQ, gain, etc, to get the full sound they want. I've heard others claim to get their sounds with really careful EQ.  On the other hand, it's not always simple to get your sounds with a real amp, if your only mic is a 57. The 57 is great, but it's never going to give you the sound of a ribbon or condenser, which might be key to the sounds you want. The SM57 is won't deliver the bottom or airy top end that you might get from a condenser or ribbon.  I would suggest you try both real mics and amp sims. If you can't afford the latest Line 6 gear, try picking up an older model used from Craigslist. I bet you can find a PODxt for almost nothing these days."

If you get a fantastic top of the range amp you're going to (most likely) get great sounds from it, but it won't have the variation that modeling has.  An amps sound is also subject to the room it's being recorded in. This isn't going to be an issue with modelers.   But an amp is also useful in that it can be used in practice sessions or live.  If you're only recording the one type of sound for one specific genre I'd say stick with the amp. Work on the tone you're currently getting and read up on the techniques that the pros use to record live guitars. Fiddle about with double or quad tracking to beef up the sound."

It's also a lot faster/easier to keep a modeling unit plugged in and ready to go (vs. micing up a cab).  A lot of people argue that the digital units don't ""sound right,"" but if you put the time in, you can get great tone. Most people would never know the difference.

audioengineering,3didbs,freeVia3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:07:32 2015 UTC,"If you want to record yourself to get a finished polished tone, like ( audio examples here), you are more then likely going to DI your guitar into your interface and use modeling software for the tone.  The main reason this approach is so commonly used in this particular subset of metal is that the tone produced from the software sounds ""Polished"". The results you get from your amp will vary depending on the mic position, the distance from the cab, how loud your amp is, what the gain staging is on the pre-amp, how old your strings are, the list goes on. When you DI and use modeling software you get the same tone time and time again, and those settings are easily recalled.   I am a huge fan of recording guitars live through an amp in a good room with a good mic or mics into a good pre-amp and monitored in a professionally built room. However, when I'm at home, I DI. POD Farm 2.5 is $99. for the base set, and then you can add on an ""amp pack"" that includes heads and cabs that are specifically used for high-gain aggressive music. This add on is $50.

audioengineering,3dig0a,The-Disco-Phoenix,3,Thu Jul 16 15:09:24 2015 UTC,"A few things you could do is first make sure you don't crank your studio monitors. 1/4 of the full knob range is usually a good starting point.  Remember to shut of phantom power when not in use and not to send phantom to any mics that don't need it.  Coil and store cables in a neat and safe area, a lot of people try to just make the cable as small as possible for storage but this can cause strain on the run as well as its connectors.   If you have to move your rig pretend you're working with 100 year old glass. There's no such thing as paranoid when it comes to your gear, especially for those of us who can't necessarily afford to run out mid session and replace broken equipment. After all accidents happen! That trick to avoiding those travesties is to simply remain proactive in caring for the gear (see some one set a glass of water in an area that could potentially damage equipment? Ask them to move it!!)  If you're worried about dirty power spikes grab a furnan with a meter and safety trip technology (if it don't need to go in a rack save a few bucks by just getting the strip models)   BLOW OUT YOUR SOUNDCARD!!  A quick burst of air once a week into the Ins and outs keeps you from essentially sanding the components with every use.   Also Audio Equipment generally like bedtime stories, or a nice lullaby"
audioengineering,3dig0a,Effious,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:10:43 2015 UTC,"Just read up a bit on basic gain staging and the different operating levels - mic level, instrument level, line level, and speaker.  If you understand operating levels and how the signal moves through the system you likely won't need to worry about frying anything.  Also, always read the manual for your gear."

When your budget allows I'd recommend getting a decent power supply for everything, or at the very least, a protected power strip like this  Seems like a little thing, but when working in a home studio, it's definitely a concern.  Another small thing, during electrical storms it is probably a good idea to unplug your gear and take a break. Especially if you lack a protected power supply. Sure, a surge is probably unlikely, but not worth the risk, at least in my opinion."

audioengineering,3dfp5q,TheArtOfSelfDefense,5,Thu Jul 16 01:22:18 2015 UTC,"In addition to studying the proper way to do things, when learning something new, it's often a good exercise to identify the end goal then try to figure out the required steps on your own.   Here's an example:  Goal: Record a song. You know you need to record a guitar part, vocal line, drums, and bass. Okay, how do you do that? Do you put everyone in a room, tell them to play the song, put a microphone in the middle of the room and record it that way? At this point, it's worth trying it to see how it sounds.  Let's say you tried that then realized that bass isn't loud enough, you can't hear the singer over the drums, etc. So now you want to try something else. You then come up with the idea to record each instrument separately.... But here's a problem: you have no idea how to record more than one sound at a time.. So you try to find a way to get all the sounds from the different microphones to blend together electronically and record that signal. You find out that there's a tool that does this. It's called a mixer. You then plug all the different mics to the mixer, connect the output to your recorder, and now record the band playing the song. The drums are still too loud. You need a way to turn them down. The mixer has volume controls for each channel. You then adjust the volume of each channel. It sounds a lot better.  Keep doing recordings, and eventually you'll understand why there's so many knobs. Also, you may get a usable sound with having one mic in the room. Part of the art is not only knowing what all the knobs do. It's also knowing when to not use any of those tools because they aren't needed for the particular recording."
audioengineering,3dfp5q,frankalliance,6,Thu Jul 16 06:46:40 2015 UTC,"Start by sorting out routing options. Knowing the patching capabilities and signal processing that goes on in a DAW is key.   Learn about bit depth/sample rate.  Learn about your basic tool belt: EQ and compression are your 2 dearest homies and they've got your back. Time-based processing such as delays and reverbs come next. Learn all of the little knobs, and listen to what they do. Compression and EQ are hard to hear at first, after a few years, 1 dB adjustments start to sound enormous. As you advance, phasers, flangers, choruses, as well as overdrive/distortion and bit crushing should be on your list of tools to play with.  Learn music theory, depending on what the application of your engineering is, it may help to learn MIDI programming and arrangement.  Once you've gotten a good dozen complete mixes under your belt, learn about export and mastering options. Learn about dither and sample rate conversion.  Mostly, have fun. You'll look back in a few years, cringe at the quality, and then realize you've grown drastically."

audioengineering,3di2m5,ijustplaybass,3,Thu Jul 16 15:03:11 2015 UTC,"Shopping for monitors is one of the most difficult gear purchases to make, because what people look for in a monitor is incredibly subjective and the environment the monitor will be in and how the monitor will be used can vary so much.  I'm in the midst right now of discovering that it gets even worse when you get into the higher end of things, no one can agree on anything when it comes to monitors.  I will say that the Yamaha HS8/HS80 are probably my favorite monitors that I've used in that price range; they're pleasant to listen to while not being overly flattering.  Whichever monitors you get, you'll eventually grow used to their idiosyncrasies, so you should get something with good detail that you enjoy listening to.  Listen to music you're familiar with (or even better, music you have mixed) and go with your gut. You should also consider buying used once you have an idea of what you like, you can snag a pair of HS80s for around $500 on most days.  Finally, I know it's been said, but don't put too much stock in the opinions/advice of the guys at Guitar Center.  They likely haven't used many different monitors in professional situations and are likely basing much of their opinions either off of listening to music in the monitor room (which as you experienced isn't the best experience) or off of what makes them the most gross profit.  Even most professional engineers haven't even come close to hearing everything that's out there, so monitor hunting becomes a very personal journey."

audioengineering,3di2m5,ijustplaybass,2,Thu Jul 16 16:41:40 2015 UTC,"The most important thing when comparing monitors is to make sure you choose a song you know back to front, literally have listened to hundreds if not thousands of time, even better is a song you've mixed yourself on whatever you've been using, which is I assume a decent set of monitoring headphones.  First off I would suggest don't worry about sub response, you'll be better off with a sub purchased later than trying to compromise now. Let your monitors be responsible for the mids and highs, and let them do that job really well. Like the Bruce Lee quote about fearing the man who has done 1 kick 10000 times rather than the man who has done 10000 kicks 1 time.   This essentially means that you probably don't need monitors with an 8"" cone.  ALSO, I would say save up till you can afford something in the >1000 range, the step up in quality is worth it.  For a personal recommendation I would try and find a set of Genelec 1029A's, they're what I ended up choosing because they are flat across the board. They've been discontinued so you can usually find them for <1000, I got mine for 450 AUD.  They don't have the weird highs that you have to sculpt out with the yamaha's, and they don't try to do the lows so they aren't compromising in the mids (and the bass extension extends to ~40-50 Hz anyway).   Seriously, they continuously amaze me. They sound good when the mix is good, but they don't hide the flaws at all.  I tried the HS8's the other week and was unimpressed, they aren't bad, but they aren't amazing. Yamaha tend to do this weird thing with the highs that you are supposed to sculpt out, which would really annoy me when mixing for long periods.  TL;DR I suggest you save up and get something better. If you don't have any, get some good headphones. There are a lot of options in around the 300-500 range that are excellent, and you will want to have them anyway.  Edit: Seems you are looking in the range I suggested, bloody single speaker pricing!"

On that note, 10x10 (I assume feet?

I work in a similar sized space and don't any issues with clarity, volume can sometimes get a bit high but I think that's usually because I get into my music when I'm writing it so I want it to be loud... then I remember that I'll probably be doing it for a while and blasting the house with the same loop for 2 hours isn't the most considerate thing to do :/ and also it's a bit harder to hear subtleties when loud :/ tbh I change volume all the time when I'm mixing... so yeah...

audioengineering,3dga4o,siborg71,4,Thu Jul 16 01:10:52 2015 UTC,"Ultimately you're going to be able to get whatever effort you put in.  My band's album recording process was less than sterling, we came across a ton of roadblocks during the recording as it was a long, arduous process recording inside of a rehearsal studio and trying to schedule recording days around other bands' practice sessions, forget having decent equipment, but we're currently mastering everything and everyone in the band is extremely happy with how things have come along, thanks to a mutual sense of perfectionism and a personal drive on my part to be the best producer I can be.  If you'll please humor me, let me walk you through what we did, just to give you a hint of a clue as to what I'm talking about.  First thing's first, we click tracked every little thing out.  We do a lot of ridiculous stuff, prog elements with lots of stoner metal influences, extremely complicated shit--the very first riff on the album is in 23/8.  There's no way we weren't going to do this without a click.  So I programmed some basic drums, and DI'd the guitars and bass through amp models so our drummer would be able to jam as if it was with the rest of the band.  We recorded the drums through a nearly destroyed Yamaha gf24/12 (4 of the pres are completely shattered, plenty of knobs are broken, thing's obviously been smoked over for years.  A once beautiful mixer now a shell of its former self.  Whatever we got it for like $300, can't beat 18 working pres for that), after spending about a whole day doing what we could to treat the room, moving the drums out into the middle of the room and getting the mics set up meticulously to avoid phasing.  We played with everything to taste but our final set up was thus:  Sterling Audio ST31 on the snare, Shure Beta-52A on the kick.  Shure SM57s on all 4 rack/floor toms.  CAD TM-211s on roto toms.  CAD CM 217 on the hi hat, with the -10 db and hi pass filter on.  Sterling ST59 as an overhead, with hi pass, -10 db pad on, in cardioid pattern sitting directly behind our drummer, pretty high off the kit so as to get a nice wash of the whole thing.  All of this via every XLR cable we could scrounge up or borrow into the 24/12, using the highest quality cables for kick, snare, and overhead, and the cheaper ones for everything else.  Because the mixer is actually intended for live performance, and I don't have any sort of firewire system or anything, we had to set everything up as close to perfect as possible.  We spent a lot of time just tweaking the sound, then once it was as good as we could get it we sent the stereo outs into our other guitarist's Focusrite Scarlett 2i2, and started recording in the DAW to the click tracks.  Our drummer rocks like no-fucking-one else so he gets 11 songs, most of which are over 6 minutes long, done in 2 days.  So then it's guitar time.  We put the cabinets in the room facing the corner of the wall to reduce reflection as much as possible and set the SM57 or ST31 (for guitars) or Beta52a (for the bass, don't feed me shit about DI I like cabs) up in front of the speakers.  We traded pedals for weeks and played with dialing in different noises, at one point our other guitarist built a SUPERBOARD out of all 30-something pedals the band has and just fucking went with it.  We spent a lot of time trying to differentiate our tones; I'm bright with lots of mids and treble, our other guitarist went lots of bass and mids, and our bassist was pretty much turning knobs for every punch.  So after a few weeks we have the instrumental tracks.  Great, starting to sound good.  So it's vocals time.  We weren't about to record vocals in the same room that we did the other stuff in.  Amps and drums are okay to record in a lot of spaces, in my experience--They're loud, very loud, and so when you're hitting that mic with ultra high SPLs some bad roomage can be forgiven... this isn't true with vocals, you just can't get that loud without sounding shit.  So we asked our bassist's dad if we could use his library to record.  It made sense to me--Endless halls of books of different sizes, a low-ish ceiling, and a nice desk for us to set up a sort of stripped down version of my studio.  We set up a few mics and went to town, double- and triple- layering all the vocals (The stoner influence--double track ALL vocals), sometimes going as far as 8-10 layers for the really big stuff.  Harmonies, whispered vocals, mumbled shoegazy vocals, all sounded pretty good in that library.  We recorded a few other things in there; acoustic guitars and some tambourine stuff.  Now fast forward to, I guess about 2 weeks ago.  The computer comes back home with me, I set up my monitors and it's mixing time.  Now we're cooking.  The first thing I do is go to those drums and start trying to pretend like I can mix them.  I split everything up, EQ-wise, into 3 tracks; bottom material, middle material and top end.  I add a little bit of overdrive/saturation to each section, keep it all relatively transparent, add some more EQ to further shape the tone of the disparate parts.  Well, fuck, the hi hat was too loud in a few sections but it's too fucking late to go back and start that shit again so OH WELL I'LL CALL IT ARTISTIC VISION FUCK ALL. Sure I wish I'd have cut a bit more bass and added a bit more top end to the kick but REGRETS ARE FOR WALKING VAGINA MEN.    I don't have the luxury of being able to manipulate the drums at the level I'd like to, so I just mix them completely merged, essentially in mono.  This is why it was so important to spend a TON of time making sure everything's in phase--once it's in mono phasing issues become glaring and gross and fucks up your whole mix.  Well they come out fine.  Splash some more saturation or reverb or delay where it's needed, we're not skimpy here this is psychedelic hobo town.  Spend some time doing weird electronic stuff to some things, whatever you know how it is.  Saturate the fuck out of the guitars, I don't give a fuck what anyone says it sounds good and makes them meaty as hell.  Drums and bass are dead center, guitars panned out 100%, vocals go wherever the damn fuck I feel like putting them.  Mixing's done, everything sounds good, everything's peaking at -6 db, mastering time.  Hit that shit hard when it's supposed to be loud, let it breathe for all the spacey shit, keep it transparent no one wants the loudness wars back, just get the loudest parts a tiny smidge underneath peaking and WE'RE FUCKING DONE.  well not really.  I still have a bit to do.  We have some cool transitional elements that I still have to work on and like 3 full songs that I've got mixed but not mastered.  So it's probably gonna be another week or so of work before I'm really done, but hey, can't complain, things are moving fast and sounding good.  If that felt like a lot to read, or that I was rambling, I guess I'm just trying to make a bigger point:  It doesn't matter how you get there.  If it sounds good, you should be satisfied no matter the method.  Keep working at it until it fits your mental image  TL;DR: Started recording 11 songs about 4 months ago with less/shittier gear than what you have.  Now we're just about finished and i couldn't be happier with the sound we've gotten.  All thanks to the fact that I kind of know my shit and we've got good players.  You can do it too."
audioengineering,3dga4o,MrVibratum,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:01:01 2015 UTC,"Wow! I really enjoyed reading that story man, it sounds like we're on the same page there. Our whole band are going to become each others worst enemies in our process. We are going to push each other for absolute perfection in terms of performance. Our drummer tends to play better when he's pissed off, so we'll be pushing him especially hard!  We're going to at the very least, depending on time, get the guitars and drums tracked on the weekend we rent the room. I've read many different schools of thought on the bass, but I don't think it plays as big a part in our bands sound to warrant recording his cab. If we have time, I'll stick my kick drum mic in front of his 15' cab and a 57 in front of one of his 10' speakers as well as run a DI from his chain in the room. That way, if the speakers sound shit, we have the DI signal to play with.  On your recording, I'd really love to hear it once its ready. Please PM me with a link once it's done. I'd love to hear what you were able to achieve. I kind of know my shit as well (still learning, but I don't think that ever stops), so I'm hoping I can get a pretty decent mix from the tracks. We are just doing 2 tracks to start off with to see if its successful. If so, we'll look at trying to repeat the process for another 2-3 tracks and release an EP. The thing that makes me, and the rest of the band, so excited about trying this is the fact that all the other bands in our scene are doing the same thing: dropping lots of cash on overly, highly polished and perfect recordings and they're all sounding like carbon copies of each other."
audioengineering,3dga4o,MrVibratum,2,Thu Jul 16 22:25:05 2015 UTC,"Hahahah just don't stay too pissed man, that tends to break good bands up.  Yeah we did our first EP that way too, 5 songs just to get the band in recording mode last year back when we still didn't have a lot of the new microphones that we bought (no Beta52 so the kick completely disappeared on that record, no SM57s or ST31 or ST59 so guitars and vocals were all recorded with LITERALLY THE SHITTIEST MICROPHONE IN THE WORLD, a PG47 that had been dunked in beer and sprite on 2 seperate occassions).  Even so that EP came out pretty well, even if none of the songs sound the same and shit's fucked up... it was a learning process.  The album (featuring the same songs as the EP, plus another 8) is, just in terms of audio quality, easily 200 times better IMO.  The whole reason we did this, is because we tried recording at the 'good' studio around here... and the guy fucked us.  Didn't pay attention to input gain so there was digital clipping everywhere, he didn't give a fuck about the music in general so the mixes he gave us were utter shit.  Guy just didn't care about what WE were trying to do, when WE were the ones paying him.  So I decided to suck it up and save for the last 3-4 years to get enough gear to record, now here we are.  I'll send you our stuff, sure thing.  I'd love to get as much feedback on it as possible once it's in a sort-of 'done' state."
audioengineering,3dga4o,seaquestions,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:43:23 2015 UTC,"Nah, he's all good. He's my brother and we've been jamming together for years. I know how far to push and he knows it's all in the interest of creativity.   Don't get me started on studios. We just dropped $600 on a single recording including mixing and mastering. Turned out as bad as it was rushed. Never again. I'd much rather spend the band money on more gear and do it ourselves, looking over it with a magnifying glass."
audioengineering,3dga4o,jrob1977,2,Fri Jul 17 06:00:07 2015 UTC,"Here's how I would attack this:  First, I'd see what I could do about the acoustics of the room. As u/ReverendLucas mentioned, look into getting bass traps because no matter how awesome your mics and preamps are, you're going to be fighting the bass resonances in a nasty way. Can you get a couch or plush chair in there to set next to the kit? Some rugs to throw down, comforters, blankets and pillows? Anything to dry up that room as much as you can. Something is better than nothing. Those curtains will help.   As for the recording configuration, if the drummer can play the track by himself to a click, get those drums recorded by themselves. E602 on the kick, SM57 a few inches away from top of snare, SM57 on bottom of snare (invert the phase of the second mic so they're working together), NT2A overhead pointed at the snare.   If the drummer must play with the band, keep that same configuration for the kit but grab that second SM57 from the bottom of the snare and mic the guitar cab. Bass goes DI.   As far as preamps go, it's okay if the Behringer on the drums is a must and you use 002 for the other instruments. It's not going to make the sound as a whole inconsistent. At worse, it will add variety.   The other major consideration is placement of players in the room. To prevent lots of sound reflection getting in your drum mics, try placing the kit so it's facing the room vs. a corner or a wall. If it's going to be up against a wall facing the room, put your blankets up against that wall. Move things around, see what works.   So that's what I would do personally with the gear and room you mentioned. As you said, it's an experiment so you can use a guideline that seems safe and break from it if something just sounds right to you. Follow your musical instincts, chase what excites your ears. If it sounds good to you, most likely it is good."
audioengineering,3dga4o,ReverendLucas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:03:18 2015 UTC,"If it were me, I would use the best preamps on the drums. You can always overdub the guitars later if your first takes sound bad, but if you need to re- track the drums then you're basically starting from scratch.  Look up some drum mic techniques. Obviously, you want the e602 on the kick. I would use one 57 on the snare. You can use a 58 on one guitar amp (it will sound fine), and you can always overdub that guitar later if it sounds bad. The 58s are fine if you want close mics on the toms, but you should really focus on the drum overheads. You could do traditional left and right overheads using the 3-to-1 rule or try XY coincident with the Rode M5s. You could also try Glyn Johns method and skip the close mics on the toms.  Recording drums, guitars and vocals at the same time is going to give you a lot of mic bleed. That means you'll need everyone to pretty much nail their parts. Sure, you can do guitar or vocal overdubs, but the original part will still be present in the drum overheads, etc. So, if one guitar was totally out of tune, those out of tune notes will be stuck in the background of your mix.  If your drummer can play to a click, you might consider recording drums, guitars and vocals separately. That's how my band does it.   I'm a guitarist and I'm our band's recording engineer. I record scratch guitar, bass and vocal tracks to a click at home to help give the drummer cues for transitions, etc. I record the drummer by himself using the click and scratch tracks, then I overdub guitars and vocals later. Sometimes, I record guitar + vocal overdubs simultaneously to save time, but only if I can isolate the guitar and vocals in different rooms to prevent mic bleed.  Even without a click, you may be able to just record the drums and bass guitar (DI) together, then do guitars and vocals with overdubs."

audioengineering,3dg2dm,indirect_storyteller,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:20:28 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, the Pro 40 uses the firewire 400, the six pin variation and the newer macs use firewire 800. Apparently the 400 is a variation from 1995 and the 800 is from 2002, which is a bit weird to me that they'd be using such an old system. 400 is capable of data transfers up to 49.152 Mb/s and 800 up to 400 mB/s which is pretty damn fast. Still, with tech that's been around since '02 you'd expect Focusrite to step it up a tad. Fortunately the 800 port are backwards compatible to 400 so connectors won't be any more than a $5 issue.   On Thunderbolt, I don't think it'd matter very much to me. I've been having issues with a whine when using my thunderbolt to HDMI adapter and a second monitor so I may need to check where the fault lies. I'm seriously hoping that it's my current interface.

audioengineering,3ddkza,tguss8,7,Wed Jul 15 13:35:59 2015 UTC,"You're probably right on both counts. In class I was taught two tricks for doubling vocals - one is to have a send on the vocal bus to a pitch plugin (the default PT one works well IMO) and to add/subtract 7 cents to give it a chorus effect. This also works well for other instruments.   I was also taught in school to record doubles of each vocal line - it helps during the chorus to give it more oomph. (It also sounds more fluid if you double it twice and pan the doubles left and right, and line up the transients with Vocalign)."

audioengineering,3ddkza,manysounds,2,Wed Jul 15 21:04:39 2015 UTC,"That is called Haas Effect and isn't ""doubling"", just a stereo widening.  See Voxengo Stereo Touch.  This (especially your) method also has the potential to add some undesirable phasing issues to the track as a very short delay can introduce comb-filtering to the sound. If you THEN pitched and/or modulated one of them slightly then you get something akin to Artificial (or automatic) Double Tracking -made famous by The Beatles.  Check out Vaccumsound ADT which is a cool and useful plugin that does this. It was a big thing in the 80s/90s to have a dual pitch shift that would stereo split your vocal and then pitch the left side up a few cents and the right side down the same amount.  This is still used quite a bit, especially live.  Most every DAW has a pitch shifter thing of some kind built in that will do this but I like this one. FYI, duplicating tracks is usually a fairly inefficient way of doing things.  There is usually a ""cleaner"" and more efficient way (especially workflow-wise) of doing anything that involves copying a track. All that being said, actual double tracking, as in two separate takes playing together, has a different and unique sound from ADT, pitch shifting, and modulation effects (like chorus and symphonic) and is often a better choice, especially for powerful chorus sections.

audioengineering,3ddkza,kerglia,-4,Wed Jul 15 22:11:02 2015 UTC,"Why does mastering engineers ask for plenty of headroom on the source files provided. I mean, I get that they don't want them to clip, but it takes literally two seconds to take the level down a notch. What am I missing here?"
audioengineering,3ddkza,Ur-Germania,5,Wed Jul 15 15:32:58 2015 UTC,It's not necessarily the level but actually the fact that they want something without a compressor on the master bus.  A mastering engineer needs to be able to control the dynamics of the track and will know how to do that more transparently than just putting a limiter/maximizer on the track.  A ME cannot easily undo pumping/sucking due to running a limiter too hot.
audioengineering,3ddkza,RobinUrthos,3,Wed Jul 15 18:21:23 2015 UTC,"But that is not what they are saying. They all say ""leave plenty of headroom"". I see this factoid everywhere. From Text books on mixing/engineering to the homepages of mastering studios."
audioengineering,3ddkza,Ur-Germania,2,Wed Jul 15 19:08:26 2015 UTC,"/u/RobinUthos is pretty spot on, but I can elaborate with more words that may or may not be bs.  Leaving headroom means that at the end of the mixing process there is headroom left, and you should leave it alone (as opposed to taking away the headroom, e.g. by a limiter.)    If you gain-stage instruments properly and mix them using conventional methods, the result will be a track that has an output around -6dBFS.  In this way, asking for a -6dBFS mixdown is kinda like requesting that the mix has been mixed professionally, or at least has been mixed following the recording industry's longstanding conventions for mixing.  For a mastering engineer, starting with a mix that follows standard conventions makes the work more predictable and the result reliable.  (Or, starting with a brick-wall-limited super-saturated mixdown makes the work impossible.)  It's also the case that technology has changed - there's much more possible in the digital domain than there was in analog - and so have mixing and mastering workflows.  In some ways, ""leave lots of headroom"" is a byproduct of ""downward compression only"" and not as practical for the way a lot of music is made today."
audioengineering,3ddkza,djbeefburger,2,Wed Jul 15 19:18:26 2015 UTC,"Because it is not the mix engineers job to bring the track(s) to their final levels.  If your mix is going to the mastering engineer and you only have a dB or two of head room, you're making the mastering process tougher.  It's not just as simple as ""turn down the level.""    Go into protools or another DAW and pull up a session. Now pull up some of the tracks so the master bus is clipping.  Pull down the master bus.  The red light goes off! But you didn't get rid of the clipping, you've just tricked the computer.  Mastering is a very delicate task, and limiting the mastering engineer with too little headroom is like trying to play guitar with three strings. You're adding limitations that don't need to be there."
audioengineering,3ddkza,LegalPirate,2,Wed Jul 15 21:18:57 2015 UTC,"But you didn't get rid of the clipping, you've just tricked the computer.   This depends on the DAW.  Most DAWs now use floating-point calculation, which means that clipping will only happen when the master bus output is saturated.  Anyways, for /u/Ur-Germania, it might be more helpful to think of headroom as a place for a signal to go when it needs to but not where the signal needs to stay.  In other words, ""leaving headroom"" means you should export your track with your levels set low enough that you have no clipping and need no master bus limiters or compressors.  Instead of the signal hanging around -12 dB RMS and peaking at 0 dB, you'll have something that hangs around -24 dB RMS (depending on song) and hopefully not peaking much higher than -2 dB.  Leaving headroom does not mean not using the headroom."
audioengineering,3ddkza,RobinUrthos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:48:05 2015 UTC,"Dammit, I always forget about floating point! Thank you, you were able to explain it much better than I."
audioengineering,3ddkza,LegalPirate,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:09:49 2015 UTC,"If it's a 24 bit file those last 16 dB don't really give you any better sound and the S/N gains are negligible.  SO, the mastering engineer needs to be able to feed a level into whatever chain they are using.  Turning things down is counter-intuitive to driving a compressor and many (not all) compressor type plugins consider -16dBfs (or so) to be the equivalent of 0dBVU.  So if your level is almost hitting 0 on the clip meter it's as if you were hitting +16dB on an analog VU meter, completely farking up your compressor's response curve.  My numbers may be off but that's essentially it."
audioengineering,3ddkza,manysounds,3,Wed Jul 15 20:45:40 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this, surely thee signal:noise ratio would be better if it was less headroom"
audioengineering,3ddkza,tomjarvis,2,Wed Jul 15 20:27:38 2015 UTC,"My theory in this is 'headroom' is interpreted in two different ways. It's incorrectly interpreted as peak level, where in fact it's about how compressed the signal is. This means you could get a mix that peaks at -.5 dBFS which is more dynamic and has more headroom than a mix that peaks at -6 dBFS but is really squashed. Dunno, but that's my thoughts"
audioengineering,3ddkza,camtomlee,2,Wed Jul 15 19:07:34 2015 UTC,"It is not all about headroom, but about dynamic range, i.e. the difference between the loudest and quietest parts across all of the songs on an album.  They do not tell you that because simply asking you to not compress on he main buss what you give them (leave plenty of headroom), will suffice. Now you probably DO want to and will have parts that are very loud and close to clipping. That is usually ok, as part of the mix.  Compressing the audio will bring up the soft parts of the audio and that is where dynamic range is lost.  Without compression your loudest part may be -2db and your softest part - 12db. With compression it can get into 0/-1 db for the loudest part, and the part that makes it actually sound louder is bringing up the soft parts, which are now say -4/-5db.  In this scenario the ME just lost 8 db to play with and is now confined to a 4 db window leaving him with very limited options.  So, make it loud, mix it how you want, just leave the dynamics. If you are worried they wont give it the sound, punch, in your face you want, run them a rough compressed demo, e.g. add that compression and bounce it to stereo, but do not do this to your stems. They can work their magic and then compress the shit out of it if that is what you want but it gives them room to dance in the middle before they melt faces."
audioengineering,3ddkza,dejoblue,2,Wed Jul 15 23:19:59 2015 UTC,Mastering engineers use lots of compression and limiting which will lower the headroom when they're done with it.  They want to start with plenty of headroom so that when they apply a moderate amount of compression they don't start peak limiting.
audioengineering,3ddkza,hamsterwheel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:22:10 2015 UTC,There is nothing stopping them from lowering the level before they start.
audioengineering,3ddkza,Ur-Germania,0,Wed Jul 15 19:16:35 2015 UTC,"if you're giving them a bounced file, lowering the volume on their computer after you bounced the file will do nothing to lower the headroom on the file you gave them."
audioengineering,3ddkza,hamsterwheel,5,Wed Jul 15 19:24:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  And a mastering engineer should be given the recording that they need, not something they're going to have to muck with level-wise before they even get to the actual work of mastering."
audioengineering,3ddkza,manysounds,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:45:51 2015 UTC,"We're talking about dynamics and fidelity here.  Slamming a limiter and then leaving the level 14 dB under full scale digital won't help a thing.  Leaving your mix at an average loudness around 14 dB under full scale digital and allowing transients (of the snare for example) to reach 6 or 4 dB under full scale digital will give your music much more depth and fidelity, leaving headroom. I am NOT talking about a snare that has been compressed to hell either. With this room you can now raise the level during more intense passages too, such as a chorus or ending.  Now when you deliver THIS to a qualified Mastering Engineer, they will be able to preserve all of this sonic goodness while bringing the average loudness to something that will compete with other professionally released material."
audioengineering,3ddkza,SoCoMo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:28:44 2015 UTC,"In the days of tape it was vital that the MIx engineer left plenty of headroom because a big dynamic mistake could mean huge problems when cutting a vinyl.   Today most people send mastering engineers 2-tracks or printed multi tracks while it is useful to bring the level up in the mix stage just to audition it on all the sets of speakers you own. A mastering engineer needs at least 10dB of headroom to master the track so that he can work with dithering and artifacts.   Essentially unless you wanna pay someone to polish a turd, give the professional what he needs to do his job well."

Just remember that the best case scenario is that the result sounds weird, thin, and overly-dynamic. In the worst case scenario you could be missing whole mix elements because they didn't need any extra PA reinforcement. I've probably sent out a lot of board feeds with little to no bass or snare in them and way too much kick drum and vocals."
audioengineering,3ddkza,BurningCircus,5,Wed Jul 15 20:22:16 2015 UTC,The thing is a live sound guy is not producing something to be listened to independently.

audioengineering,3ddkza,gonzales82,2,Sun Jul 19 23:18:55 2015 UTC,"Its not about making big changes like heavy compression or tape saturation or widening the stereo image or anything like that. Those sorts big creative changes are rare in professional mastering rooms, and definitely something you should try to avoid doing without being sure that your client isn't going to mind.   Hopefully you're mastering in a different room/speakers than the music was mixed/tracked in. In that case, the advantage of mastering is getting to hear the music on a different setup, and making SMALL adjustments to the mix to compensate for the it's deficiencies. Im talking like -2dB at 250hz because the mix is a bit muddy or +2dB at 8k because the mix is a bit dull.   The other important part of mastering is that you should be mastering with the other tracks on the album/ep/whatever in mind. One of your main goals is to make them fit together in the context the album. So maybe a track with a lot of bass sounds good on its own, but makes the next track sound thin and wimpy. You're also trying to match the overall loudness of the different tracks.   A good master is one that doesn't ruin/significantly change a perfectly good mix. Don't take crazy creative liberties. You're just tightening things up. You're just the extra ears on the project that are there to make sure it doesn't suck.   Of course professional mastering also deals with formats, DDP, and distribution related things."

Here's he thing: no matter which you choose, you are going to need an interface. A DI box does not act as some sort of 'guitar to pc' converter - you will need to run the guitar through the DI box, and then to your interface/mixer. Here's the other thing: does your interface have an 'instrument' input? If so, you don't really need a DI box. But I personally never trust instrument inputs, so I use a DI box anyway, but you don't technically need one. Finally, if you do choose a DI box, then it will work with your electric bass.

audioengineering,3ddkza,dejoblue,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:24:06 2015 UTC,"The short answer is no, although once you start getting into hundreds of tracks the extra DSP can be helpful even with today's computers. However, in some cases (esp UAD) it's the plugins that run on those DSP cards that are particularly desirable, and the DSP is a bonus (or, if you are out of DSP but have plenty of Native power left, an annoyance). Or, if the interface and DSP are connected more integrally to each other than to the CPU (ie HDX or UAD Apollo) the DSP's low latency allows you to track through the plugins in much the same way you would with hardware."

The AT2035 is a great mic, the tonality is brighter than the SM57 (which is a good thing in most vocal recordings), but otherwise very clean. It's not exactly the life of the party as a microphone though, it wouldn't cut it as a pop vocal mic on it's own.  Either of these mics through a hot amplifier would probably sound incredible.

audioengineering,3ddu6h,transparENT_motives,24,Wed Jul 15 14:24:14 2015 UTC,"I think that working backwards would help here: You should actually hear what phase cancellation sounds like.  Open up your DAW of choice and record a single mono channel of something like bass or percussion. Preferably a continuous sound you can hear easily.  Now copy that mono channel to a new channel. Play them both back at the same volume and listen.  Now I want you to zoom way the hell in on one of your strips of audio and nudge it forward so that it is no longer in perfect synchronous alignment with its twin. Nudge it forward in the smallest increments of time you can manage. Every now and then, stop and take a listen to what's happening as the two channels drift out of alignment with each other.  At a magical point, your playback will start to lose its bass and volume. It'll sound brittle and quieter than expected. It might even sound like its coming from behind you, instead of from your monitors. This is a special effect you can deliberately use to mess with the listener if you're recording, say, some psychedelic rock music.  Mix that horrible phase cancellation down to a single Wave file and then take a look at it in your favorite waveform visualizer/editor. That's right, phase cancellation is plainly visible in simple waveforms – your waveform will become ""unbalanced.""  You'll begin to realize that two microphones recording two channels can unintentionally create the same circumstances described above. Particularly if they are equidistant from the sound source.  Caveat: I am an amateur and may have misunderstood the question. Nonetheless, the process described above is something you should play with."

audioengineering,3ddu6h,MY_SHIT_IS_PERFECT,4,Wed Jul 15 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"Look at the recorded waveform of a signal. It goes up and down along a central line. If two signals go up and down at the same time, they are in phase. If one goes up when the other goes down, they are out of phase. Signals that are perfectly out of phase cancel each other out (resulting in silence).  When you're recording drums, make sure your snare mics (top and bottom) are in phase with each other and the overheads, that's usually the most common problem. Same applies to kick drum, if you use more than one mic for it. The tricky part is that in real recording situations phase issues aren't completely black and white. Typically, with drums, a phase issue tends to sound like a lack of body of the drum, or a lack of bass."
audioengineering,3ddu6h,jajohu,3,Wed Jul 15 14:40:16 2015 UTC,"Phase is the time relationship between multiple mics that are picking up the same sound source.  A good way to understand this is to think of a drum kit with multiple microphones.  Here's a visual:  https://imgur.com/a/AozjY  The sound from the snare drum travels at a constant rate to the snare mic and the overheads.  As you can see from the second picture, it reaches the snare mic first, the left overhead second, and the right overhead third.  Using Protools I can visually see and measure the time difference, and if I want a more ""modern"" sound I can use time adjust plugins to delay the snare mic to be perfectly in time with the overheads.  I can also delay the left overhead to be in time with the right, which will bring the snare perfectly in the center of the stereo image.  When recording sometimes we measure the distance from the snare to each of the overheads and physically adjust the positioning until they're the same distance, in which case you probably won't need to adjust the overheads as much as I had to here.    Another consideration with phase is making sure all of your mics are in sync when they are pushing and pulling air pressure.  You'll notice that in all four wave forms pictured, the initial impact of the snare goes downward.  One thing we did while recording was invert the phase of the bottom mic at the preamp so that it would be ""in phase"".  Think of the top and bottom snare mics and how they're pointing at each other.  If the snare drum is pushing air downward, it will push the bottom snare mic diaphragm while pulling on the top mic diaphragm.  If you sum these signals together, they will partially or fully cancel each other out (-10 plus +10 = 0).  We flip the phase of the bottom snare mic to avoid this, so that summing the mics together = a bigger sound (+10 plus +10 = 20).  The most important thing is to use your ears and listen to what happens when you make these adjustments, and to do so in a very clear and quick A/B comparison.  Solo the two mics and flip them in and out of phase.  If you're using time align plugins, bypass them and double check that you like what's happening.    As someone else mentioned in this thread, phase is a rabbithole and you can only go so far with it.  If there is a lot of bleed in your mics, improving the phase of one close mic could affect the phase of another mic or instrument.  Using gates can help mitigate this, as can recording in a well treated room with good mic technique and a player that doesn't overplay the instrument.    This is also why as an engineer I try to minimize the number of mics that I use, and as a drummer I use a small 4-piece kit.  Fewer mics means fewer phase problems."
audioengineering,3ddu6h,insolace,2,Wed Jul 15 20:58:25 2015 UTC,"You should measure distances to help you out, or move to a technique with minimal mics like recorder man or glynn johns. Don't worry tho, they sound great.  You can tell if you have phase issues by putting your mix in mono just to check, and if certain sounds drop out of the mix, you've got issues there. You might also find that as you bring up a fader to blend with another channel you'll hear it rise in volume for a little bit and then there will be a are portion of the fader that doesn't seem be increasing the volume at all until it's too loud, sometimes as you raise a fader it even seems to lower both channels volumes, these are evidence of phase issues.   The issue comes from signals arriving at the mics at different times, so you can help yourself out a lot by measuring distances between mics and keeping important aspects of the kit like the snare in the center, as well as minimizing bleed. I tend to explain it like a trampoline, with no one on it and viewed from the side it almost looks like that center line you see through a waveform like jajohu explained. You put kids on it, and if they all jump together with good timing they all get a synergistic boost and get some extra height. If you get a trickster among the kids to time their landing just a hair faster than the rest? Everyone eats their knees and don't get any height at all.   Now, lastly, you have to do your best and understand that with a drum kit especially, not everything can be in phase all the time, because the drum kit takes up a large area. Certain parts will closer to certain mics than others, and that's just how it is. Use your ears, switch to mono often, measure a lot, and do your best"
audioengineering,3ddu6h,JcMaj7,2,Wed Jul 15 16:03:41 2015 UTC,"In addition to all of the excellent descriptions in this thread, phase issues occur with your speakers. It's not as serious of a problem with small studio speakers but in a live situation it can cause havok. It usually occurs when the speakers are out of alignment either from positioning or time delay. I'm not too knowledgeable about it but just wanted to bring it up."
audioengineering,3ddu6h,lord_azael,3,Wed Jul 15 19:59:57 2015 UTC,"Phase is this horrible rabbithole in recording of alignment of soundwaves. People will tell you there's a ""magic trick"" to getting your mics in phase but the fact is that with two microphones on one source there WILL (theoretically) be out-of-phase information. What you end up pursuing is how to minimize the damage to phase integrity of your recordings. There are a couple rules to making sure your mics are as in phase with each other as possible. Typically it has to do with distance between microphones and sources and capsule alignment. Google stuff like the 3:1 rule of mic placement."
audioengineering,3ddu6h,dissonance416,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:52:23 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty complicated answer that most people don't know, but they know the consequences of it. I'll explain in short, but be prepared to be even more confused. I'll also explain about the consequences, which is what you might be interested in, but fundamental understanding might help you in the long run.  Phase is a property of a sine signal. This is a mathematical property and is not limited to sound. Phase is how much a sine is shifted from its normal start. It is expressed as an angle. So a regular sine beginning at zero, then going up to positive, then going down, crossing zero and then going negative is said to have a phase of 0 degrees. A sine starting at zero time, but going negative (so basically, the opposite of the 0 degree sine) is said to have phase of 180 degrees. An interesting thing is adding two sines of different phases. First, when you add two sine signals with same phase, you get another sine with the same phase as the beginning one, and the amplitude that is the sum of the amplitudes of the beginning ones. If you add two sines (of the same frequency) with one having phase 0 and another one having phase 180, you get a sine with the phase of a bigger one and amplitude of the difference of the two signals. So basically, having a phase 180 different from another signal and summing the two, you in effect get a subtraction of the signals. Having two signals with different phases in between, you will get a sine of varying degrees subtraction/addition and the resulting phase will be in between. Note that phase differences bigger than 180 could be represented as though they are less than 180 degrees different.   A sine sound wave is rarely seen in nature and in music. However, the phase is still important due to the fact that any signal can be represented as the sum of sines of different frequencies and different phases. Now, us humans cannot actually hear the phase differences between different frequencies. So a signal consisting of the sum of two sines would sound the same to us if the phase difference is 60,90 or 123 degrees. That's why, when you turn on the spectrum analyzer plugin, most will show only amplitudes of the signal (they would be sine signals that when combined make up that particular sound you're analyzing), but some can optionally show you the phase of the components as well. Since we are mostly insensitive to the phase, we don't need to plot it. However, where it comes to play is when you have two such signals mixed together. Imagine you have a signal, say a drum recorded with a microphone. Now, instead of recording it with a different microphone, you double the track. If you double the track, all you get is a louder signal (6 dB louder to be exact). This is because every sine of the signal is in phase (0 degrees difference) with every sine in the copy. If however, you invert one track, you get complete silence. That is because now every sine is 180 degrees off of every sine from the copy. You have effectively canceled the signals out. If you were to shift one track by a small amount (we're talking 10s of microseconds), you would get various degrees of louder/quieter, but the track would still sound the same, tone-wise. Now, these two cases are easy to notice since the difference in sound is huge. However, the more important case is recording the same drum with two different microphones at different positions. Every mic introduces some phase distortion even if the room was completely quiet (no reflections of any kind). And if the mic is ideal (no distortions), every room introduces phase shifts. And even both are ideal, you still get different phases from different drums unless your mics are in the same spot, since different sounds arrive at different times depending on the position of the mic in the room. So basically, you end up with two or more different tracks of the drum in which some of the components of some frequencies are in phase (between the tracks), some that are completely out of phase and some that are in between. If you try to adjust the phase of some components, you lose some other ones. So the phase cancellation in certain frequency regions is almost inevitable, but you want to minimize the effect it has on the tone. Now, one of the solutions would be to record the drum section twice. Small differences in timing of the drummer would make the phase impossible to cancel. However, this is not done with drums, since you would lose the attack of the hits. This is however done with guitars quite often and is almost mandatory nowadays. The way you would do it on drums is to use your ears and have someone adjust the mics while you monitor the sound and the drummer plays a beat. A person then moves the mics until you notice now major flaws in the sound. There are of course a lot of techniques to achieve this easier. I'm not a sound engineer (I am electronics and signal engineer), so I can't exactly help you in a practical example, but I can explain what is happening, which I am doing.  Sorry for the wall of text, and I have just barely scratched the surface, but this may be enough for someone beginning this. If there are any questions, I would be happy to explain in more details some of the things mentioned here."

To address recording drums, a simple phase reduction technique for overheads is an XY pair. However, other techniques are used that have distance ratios to keep things in phase."
audioengineering,3ddu6h,AdtheMad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:57:31 2015 UTC,"Essentially a waveforms time relationship with another waveform. The waves can be amplified or attenuated depending on their phase relationship with another. Phase and polarity are NOT the same thing. That little polarity button you hit flips your waveform 180 degrees, it does not change the time relationship.  For example, two mics placed at different distances from another will be out of phase because the sound is hitting the mics at different times, which will either amplify or attenuate certain frequencies.  Now let's say you have a snare mic'd on top and bottom, but the mics are the exact same distance from the source, just one is upside down from the other. Flipping the POLARITY on one of the mics would flip the signal 180 degrees so that you're not getting cancellation.  Phase is not a bad thing, although it can be bad. It's what gives us our sense of ""depth"" or ""space"" when listening to say, a drum recording. Sure you could move the tracks in your DAW to line up perfectly so the phase is generally the same which might make your drums sound more full, but you will also be losing that depth."

The best way I understand phase cancellation is that it's when the audio waves are moving in opposite directions, and essentially cancel each other out. It happens when the mics are moved in/out at different times due to being an uneven distance away from the source.   The best way to demonstrate it, is take a mono track, duplicate it in your DAW, and add reverse the phase on it (lookup how to do this in your DAW). Being an identical copy of the original track, with the opposite phase, it will cancel out and you won't hear anything.  I really like how this video explains it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N0ER4A73QE"
audioengineering,3ddu6h,siborg71,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:42:13 2015 UTC,"Filters work by mixing an audio signal with itself, at various volumes, and delayed in phase by various amounts, often mere samples or a few milliseconds.  You know a how a filter removes some frequencies, or reenforces others, this can happen in a recording with more than one microphone.  This is why people care about phase when setting up more than one mic to record something, the signals mix together with slightly delayed or inverted copies of themsevles,  creating an unwanted filtering effect that changes the spectrum of the signal.  This also happens in any regular room to all sound waves, as they bounce off the walls and mix delayed echos together, creating what is essentially a comb filter, and is the reason sound coming out of your speakers may sound different at different locations in the room, as the ""comb filter"" creates peaks and nulls in the room.  So treating the walls of a room is to try and prevent this to some extent.  Any time a signal is mixed with itself with a any delay, it behaves like a filter."
audioengineering,3ddu6h,safiire,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:30:42 2015 UTC,"From a simple scientific standpoint.  So sound travels in waves. A perfect representation of a synthesizer making, let's say, a concert C, is a series of hills and valleys (remember high school math? Parabolas!!)  So, music, is a slightly augmented and changing set of peaks and valleys.  When phase is reversed, the valleys become peaks and vice versa, creating a mirror image almost.  So when you have a recording playing on two channels, exactly the same but the phase is switched on one, they cancel each other out and you get no sound.  This can be used in a variety of ways, this is actually how noise canceling headphones work: the high quality ones have a very small mic that picks up and reverses the phase of incoming noise so all you hear is what the headphones are playing."

audioengineering,3de6op,dissonance416,24,Wed Jul 15 15:59:22 2015 UTC,"The 3:1 rule states that the when using two mics in proximity to one another (such as when two performers are playing in the same room, each with their own mic), the second mic should be at least 3x the distance from the first mic that the first mic is from its source.  So if the first mic is 1 foot away from its source, any other mic should be at least 3 feet away from the first mic.  It doesn't have to be exactly 3x, just at least 3x (in fact more distance is more effective).  This doesn't actually eliminate phase problems; it's just to make sure that sound emitted from the first mic's source is sufficiently quieter by the time it's picked up by the second mic, to help minimize phase cancellation caused by the sources bleeding into each others mics.  It's only really applicable when you've got two or more separate but similar sources being recorded simultaneously with multiple mics (such as two singers or two violin players); not so much when you have multiple mics on one source (like a drum kit or guitar cabinet)."

This creates more distance than if you measure the second mic from the source, which means less phase cancellation."
audioengineering,3de6op,BLUElightCory,2,Wed Jul 15 19:08:10 2015 UTC,I always assumed the 3:1 rule had to do with fundamental frequencies being 1/3 out of phase of one another thus not causing any big phase problems with itself and its even harmonics. (Like if it was a 2:1 rule or a 4:1 rule then the harmonics would be out of phase at certain octaves) Any truth to this or is it really just about volume?

If you place a mic a foot away from a drum, and place a second mic two feet away but on the opposite side, you will have satisfied the ""rule"" as stated but will not achieve the intended results.

It is in fact 3 times from the mic, but my point was that this applies to a distance that is also further from the source and I confused myself. The intended result is that the second mic is 4 times farther, which results in a doubling of distance twice, which yields a ~12 dB reduction in SPL, which I guess someone decided was adequate to make phase cancellation negligible.   But, you are very correct in that the application is for the two mics recording two different sources. People never seem to understand this part. The phase cancellation consideration is for bleed, not phase coherency between an array of mics on a single source."

I also kind of like the sound of a recording with a good amount of bleed, it makes it sound live."
audioengineering,3de6op,Holy_City,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:37:54 2015 UTC,"I only physically measure with stereo pairs (overheads, room mics) and usually to the center of the snare.  You want the mics to be in phase with each other, and the snare is always center in the mix, the kick's low end usually being removed from the overheads and room mics when you hi pass them.  Then in software I will look at the primary transients for each instrument mic (for the hi-hat mic you look for the crest of the wave when the hi-hat is hit, the tom mic you look for when the tom is hit) and measure the sample time between the close mic transient and the matching transient in the overheads.  I then add a sample delay plugin and adjust so that the close mic transient is in line with the overheads, since they're the mics that have the image of the whole kit.  I also check to see if the phase needs to be flipped for each close mic, the close mic waveforms should follow a similar shape as the overheads.  It's amazing how much this will clean up something like a drum kit.  Gate the toms (unless the drummer uses them all the time I'll usually do this manually by slicing the waveforms and muting the unused sections), and with just the snare, kick, hihat, overheads and room mics you can now create a beautiful stereo image of the kit before you've added any compression or gates.  The first gate I add is usually on the kick drum, and if there are two mics I'll use the key input from the close mic to gate the far mic.   The reason for the 3:1 rule is to minimize the change over time in the phase between the close mics and the overheads.  You might be in phase for the first half of the main wave form, but after some period of time you will see that it's no longer lining up, making it impossible to really ever be in phase."
audioengineering,3de6op,insolace,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:51:36 2015 UTC,"I tried manually gating toms by deleting the tracks while they aren't being used, and I got really bad results.

I have a gate on them instead and I allow some of the bleed to come in though the floor of the gate to make it sound more consistent, but I'm frustrated. I might actually make an individual thread to discussing solutions to this problem."
audioengineering,3de6op,hamsterwheel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:43:10 2015 UTC,"The problem is you have too much bleed in the tom mic.  This is a factor of how the drummer is playing and how the room is handling the bleed.  Mic placement can also help.  But none of those solutions will help you after you have recorded.  Using the gate and bringing the floor up is one way to do it, and if the bleed is bad then I'd bring the floor way up so that you're only gating about 6dB or so.    Another way would be to slice the toms and duplicate the tracks into ""Toms"" and ""bleed"" tracks.  Mute the tom waveforms in the bleed tracks, mute the bleed waveforms in the tom tracks.  Now you can adjust the volume of the bleed the same way you would adjust the ""floor"" using a gate plugin, but now you have more control over the gating itself.  A 3rd option which you could use either way is to then take some clean tom samples, preferably made when you recorded these drums so that they're the same, and to trigger them from the gated toms.  You could use these with the original recorded tom tracks to augment what was played, or you could replace entirely.  I would try the first before having to resort to the latter, but depending on your style of music one may be preferable over the other.  This is why I always sample the kit when I'm recording drums, one drum / cymbal at a time, using all of the mics."

With NOVA, you can really dig in, and get anything out- coughs, page turns, trains, cars, thunder, chair squeaks, I've had to take it all out.  It's what they use in Hollywood to take noise out of location recording."

The specifics of having to have usb 3 because you've got an amd chip sounds like narrowly avoided compatability issues.  And maybe they were not so narrowly avoided.    I'd try uninstalling completely the scarlet driver and reinstalling it.  I would also recommend a downgrade to windows 7.  The drivers for win 7 are probably much better written.

It will reduce high frequencies, but leave everything else untouched.    If it smells funny, you're breathing in chemicals that are out-gasing.    The best low-cost option for acoustic treatment is OC703 rigid fiberglass panels wrapped in fabric and possibly framed."

In both cases, using the rigid board type products can reduce costs because it isn't necessary to build a wooden frame around the panels to hang them."
audioengineering,3dcla2,PierreLunaire,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:09:28 2015 UTC,"Do you just wrap muslin or breathable cloth around the 703?  I imagine a porous, non-reflective fabric can't also sufficiently contain the fiberglass."

You'd be better off getting some cheap packing blankets and hanging them ruffled. The acoustic foam is designed to absorb the mid and high range while giving a bit of diffusion, it has a far better response than the mattress foam. It is too damn expensive but it works. You can also look into building your own broadband absorbers and combine them with foam or heavy curtains."
audioengineering,3dcla2,melicusictus,2,Wed Jul 15 08:52:45 2015 UTC,"Don't use it. For one thing, it's not gonna help much. Yes, it is typically toxic to breathe in. However, the biggest red flag for me is fire danger. In a tiny room full of electrical equipment, the foam could easily ignite. Polyurethane foam burns incredibly easily and could end up being a huge danger. Do yourself a favor and get some real acoustic treatment."
audioengineering,3dcla2,seoulsurfer,-2,Wed Jul 15 15:59:00 2015 UTC,"It won't be as efficient or look as nice as acoustic treatment, but it will work. The physics end of sound dampening is all about creating tiny little pockets of air to trap sound waves in. If you're padding a closet, I'm willing to guess it's not for recording a drumset; should work well for deadening vocal reverberations. I am not a doctor. You won't get sick unless you eat it. Don't eat it.   edit: LOL at everyone here saying it ""looks bad so it will hamper creativity"" and ""the chemicals are toxic.""  I guess everyone's a consummate professional around here when it comes to acoustic treatment of a bedroom closet."
audioengineering,3dcla2,georonymus,-2,Wed Jul 15 12:07:51 2015 UTC,"Any type of foam can substitute for acoustic foam along as its dense enough - because what you need to absorb sound is mass. The more mass you have the more frequencies you can absorb starting with high end which has little energy.   What the thin and low density mattress foam is doing is just rolling off some of the very high end in your rooms. This isn't even the problem spot. where you need absorption is small rooms is in the low mid and mid frequencies.  I don't know the exact specs of your mattress foam, but its safe to assume that its density is half of acoustic foam, so if you were to layer your foam so its 6"" deep you'll get the affect of 2-3"" acoustic foam.  Also don't record in a closet, that is the worst place to record and don't take audio advice from dumbasses on Youtube."
audioengineering,3dcla2,Slyth3rin,3,Wed Jul 15 12:59:10 2015 UTC,"Any type of foam can substitute for acoustic foam along as its dense enough - because what you need to absorb sound is mass. The more mass you have the more frequencies you can absorb starting with high end which has little energy.   By this logic, a concrete wall would be an ideal absorber. It's not. Mass keeps sound in (or out). The sound that is not transmitted through the boundary is gonna bounce right back at you.   This isn't a pedantic point on semantics. When it comes to porous absorbers, thickness can be come a problem due to gas flow resistivity. It's the same reason why denser materials become less efficient at greater thicknesses for absorbing.   Back to the op. Guesswork and acoustics don't go hand in hand. You'd be better off using materials with known acoustic properties and (ideally) treating in response to acoustic measurements."
audioengineering,3dcla2,RainbowWarfare,0,Wed Jul 15 14:21:41 2015 UTC,"You need mass to absorb up to a certain point. And I was talking about foam, which is a given that its porous .  Absorption of sound energy is essentially a collision of two objects.  Heres a billiard analogy for you. the cue ball represents sound, the object ball is the foam. To absorb sound is to transfer its energy to the foam ie the object ball. So the cue ball should stop upon impact with the object ball and the object ball will be in motion. If the object ball were a ping pong ball (low mass), the cue ball would continue moving in a near identical trajectory to its original path after impact, if the object ball were a bowling ball (high mass) the cue ball would reflect off the object ball."

If you have a given density adding more mass just means more of the material in a large volume.  Despite what companys want you to believe bass trap foam is their regular square panel foam, so the difference is theres more of it.

audioengineering,3dcl9e,jimmycoola,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:15:45 2015 UTC,"Just be careful, they can pick up a lot of echo in close or untreated indoor areas. Makes for a very roomy sound."
audioengineering,3dcl9e,Abstruse,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:05:47 2015 UTC,Do you mean lav mics or the rode stuff? Rode video mics are pretty much half-length shotgun pickup patterns
audioengineering,3dcl9e,jimmycoola,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:17:10 2015 UTC,"Rode. It depends on the mic and the room, obviously. But you see it a lot with vloggers especially (early Channel Awesome being almost posterboys/girls for this).   People starting out without any real training don't really think of sound when recording (or lighting for that matter). So they go with the built-in mic until enough YouTube comments make them buy a better mic. Then they buy a Rode (or one of the knock-offs) and slap that on thinking they fixed it. Even though they're recording in small, untreated rooms.  I watch a lot of web videos and it's gotten to the point where it's weird when I watch productions that have good sound."
audioengineering,3dcl9e,Abstruse,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:42:00 2015 UTC,"Production sound mixer here.  I use me2s all the time for features.  Sometimes on some voices they sound the best!  The me2 is as good at rejection as other lav mics.  You won't see any improvement with the me4.  I'd say the cos11 maybe a little bit better.  But in reality, there is no magic solution.  If you can hear it in the room, the mic will pick it up.  This is equally true of shotguns.  The only thing you can reliably do is control the environment.  Furthermore, I think you should def. get a shotgun.  The rode sucks.  Get the audio technica 8035 if you are on a budget.  It's the best shotgun in this price range."
audioengineering,3dbzka,hatcherhullmodano,5,Wed Jul 15 02:16:48 2015 UTC,"Since all the parts are in one track, your hands are kind of tied, but your best bet is to play around with the eq. You'll want to boost the mids and/or upper mids.  Honestly, the best way to get a better recording would be to rerecord with the iPhone placed closer to the vocalist."
audioengineering,3dbzka,german_the_llama,6,Wed Jul 15 02:34:44 2015 UTC,"As the first person said you are going uphill on this one because you are limited to having everything stuck together on one track. An alternative, assuming you can't do any real multitrack recording gear etc, is to have each player record the performance with their own phone close to them, and then take each of the recordings and sync them together.  You are pretty much guaranteed to get some phase issues, but you will have each instrument coming from a different physical location and this will help you mix it and give each instrument its own space.  So not the best situation to be in, but that alternative will give you more freedom and room to work."
audioengineering,3dbzka,thebearcredentials,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:26:40 2015 UTC,There's not much you can do since they're all stuck together. Best option would be to record them all separately. You could try de-reverberation to remove the room sound and make everything more upfront. However you will need extra software to do this. You could also try EQing to make the vocals more prominent.
audioengineering,3dbzka,ziachap,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:42:27 2015 UTC,"Multiband compression and EQ should clean it up a bit but like /u/german_the_llama said, the best way to go about this is to play around with the placement of your phone first to get the best sound of the room."
audioengineering,3dbzka,SharkDad0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:08:01 2015 UTC,Improve performance. Make sure the guitars are tuned. Try to have the person play quieter and sing louder.  Adjust mic position to maximize this.

audioengineering,3db8h2,JericDaChap,4,Tue Jul 14 22:45:34 2015 UTC,"Best thing you can do is make your room ""unsquare"" and fire the monitors down the length of your room. Square's are the worst for dips/clashes/boosts. and Cube rooms are even worse. Make your monitors symmetrical within the room, not halfway between the floor & ceiling and not halfway down the length of the room. probably have the monitors under the window side of your wall. if that 9.8' and 10' is true. Bass traps your corners and your closet full of clothes/crap will act as a great diffuser! (doors open) Bed behind you to suck up bass, window will give you some weird reflections off the rear wall, would be ideal to have a curtain some distance off the wall in front of the window to stop things from bouncing out at you, nice heavy curtain will do the trick."
audioengineering,3db8h2,Wapiti-Wisdom,3,Wed Jul 15 00:01:53 2015 UTC,"This is probably your best bet.  Main points to take from this:   speakers and desk along west wall Sliding closet doors open Somewhat thick curtain over the windows, chuck the venetians/cut them up and turn them into something cool. Possibly a QRD Diffusor. acoustic panels at angles of incidence that will create problematic reflections. So along the wall with the door about 4' from the west wall on the north and south wall.   Not sure how big your bed is but i think it will only realistically be in the south west corner of the room.  Best of luck"

The Beta 58 doesn't get much love but it's a great mic if you're going for emotion - just grab it and go.  It's cleaner sounding than a normal 58 and has less proximity effect, which is nice for recording.  I've recorded lots of metal and hardcore vocals with one.  As a bonus, you can use it live."
audioengineering,3db3qz,BLUElightCory,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:04:45 2015 UTC,"B58a is a terrible live mic, IMO.  I've spent decades with those things and they create more problems than they fix.  8k presence peak?  In MY monitors?  They also pick up a ton of cymbals.  Not so great for metal."

Then you get to hear isolated tracks if the same song through the different mics. Cheaper would be to rent the mics, but I would go to a studio so the guy that owns the mics and uses them all day could offer insight and keep me away from the ones I would blow out if I sang to loud. Every voice/mic pairing is going to offer different tone and nuance. See what you like, and ask people who have an aesthetic you trust. It might be obvious which one you should get!"
audioengineering,3dbrtd,jwax5150,3,Wed Jul 15 01:15:35 2015 UTC,"I dont think it could be any of your suggestions being the problem, as they wouldn't affect the tone of your sound. Have you recorded like this before and it sounds better? I find that recording from an acoustic pick up usually doesnt sound great anyway, no matter what the guitar. You will only get a real good sound if you record with a microphone(s) as it sounds more natural to our ears, as the pick up is too close to the strings."
audioengineering,3dbrtd,shouston10,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:20:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.

I guess it kinda makes sense? Like rotating the tires on your car for even wear? Speaker drivers are pretty heavy and if you think about how they are being suspended by the cone, I guess it makes sense. Another solution would have been to knock the speakers over so that the cones were facing down at the end of every day. Even wear across the entire speaker cone. (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞"

It's a dynamic mic, which means it's more durable, but less sensitive.   However, for delicate sounds (like a solo cup being tapped on the table), you'll want a condenser mic. The at2020 is usually recommended as a quality budget condenser (also about $100). Keep in mind, though, condensers require phantom power and low background noise.

The mixes are typically done so well to make it sound so clean and cohesive it may surprise you how many layers is the norm!  And here's a longer video of Mixing Engineer Phil Tan walking through the components and what he did to them in Rihanna's Diamonds:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2E3ifOjFmE  Notice how simple a lot of his processing is but how well thought out and carefully it is applied.  A lot of EDM and Hip-Hop and some rock production advice will still be relevant but obviously you'll need to practice and adapt/combine to think ok I get how to stack synths and layer samples now, but how do I record + add guitars, vocals, drums etc. without it clashing?, or vice versa. And study the arrangements of those artists you listed to get an idea on how you could structure your songs. Then, how do I polish it all up so it's sounds professional? Good mixing resources will be more applicable to more genres. Then the real key is writing lots of songs and putting in the work! Good luck."

People like to shit on pop records all the time but very few engineers could sit down and make a song like Toxic.

Some of the best studios in the world attract clients by using ""legacy"" and ""vintage"" equipment and praise the virtues of tube ""warmth"" and the ""punch"" of tape saturation. All this in the face of that fact that an iPhone is capable of better recording quality than the best Ampex, Studer or MCI recorder of the 1970s. And why do consumers spend hundred or thousands of dollars on premium cables with isotopic gold connectors and cold-drawn-free-range-copper-silver-alloy wires?

Then buy a new VCR tape and record the audio coming in at a pretty hot level. Then feed that audio back into your digital system (by interface/sound card etc) and you will have a subtle but noticeable analog warm to your track."

audioengineering,3d8zho,thebearcredentials,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:17:45 2015 UTC,"I don't have anything now, but I've done it several time before.  It works well when you don't have access to any analog gear but need some tangible warmth and saturation.   What you get is some very useable saturation, warmth and compression, especially suited for drums, bass and guitars that you want to warm up a bit.  Remember that each VCR will give the recording a slightly different sound.  And lo-fi and hi-fi options will give you a lot of contrast.  Experiment with the level start recording and start at a low level and recording about 10 seconds then crank the volume and record about 10 seconds.  Then listen to the playback through some sort of direct monitoring. This will help you dial in what level to set it at.  Also pay close attention to what the tape does to your high frequencies, you may need to overcompensate before you hit tape, or you may have to eq again post-tape."

There is now L/Mono out - I've tried exporting just one signal and only get audio from one speaker.

It's a much better way to achieve that 'professional sound' rather than using LoAir or Maxxbass

Especially because if and when you cut the intro, the song is only gonna be like 2:35 so you'll have the extra time.   All in all, /u/restatic nailed it and it is a really, really cool jam.

audioengineering,3d5gad,Slyth3rin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:39:18 2015 UTC,"A lot depends on how quickly you can work. I know people that will edit a sloppy drum take in an hour to perfection, but there always seem to be things that don't get done due to time constraints and that might influence radio/commercial use. That's not saying you don't have a chance to make something amazing.  I don't think a home studio is too limiting, plus I understand your room is acoustically treated. If you can, try to compare and contrast your mix against several reference songs that you know well, like a lot, fit the genre, etc. I mostly do this when I feel like I'm losing track of the sound and need to remind myself how loud the snare should be as compared to vocals, whether my guitars are too overpowering and so on.  As mentioned by somebody else, don't underestimate mastering. Think about the platform you're going to be releasing on and try to learn about mastering techniques for those, because I don't think you have enough time to get into RMS levels and different types of loudness normalizations right now. I once did a mix/master for some friends and at the very last moment they told me they're going to put it on Dolby cassettes, so I found out the conversion system distorts flat peaks and attenuates highs and edited accordingly, which is very simplistic I'm sure, but I believe it was better than if they'd used the original master. I'm by no means a pro yet, I've just seen some of the better ones at work and did a little bit myself, maybe someone else can be more informative."
audioengineering,3d5gad,CarAlarmConversation,9,Tue Jul 14 00:13:17 2015 UTC,"Its quite possible - I've mixed and mastered a 14 track album in a weekend before for a client that slacked off for 3 months until a week before the release date. I don't condone it. but the best thing to do is record everything first then start mixing. When you're mixing keep switching between songs when you start to get too familiar with the one you're currently on. Keep the songs sounding fresh and you'll be on your toes. Also you won't back track as much since theres less time for you to learn something new then go back and apply it to all the other mixes. The other thing is you have to know what you're doing and now where you want to go. You can't have ""FuckAroundItis"" and constantly be like ""ooh what will this eq sound like?""."

Do a couple mixes, then take a break for a week, do another and realize that you want to redo the first two. If everything is played well and recorded cleanly, you can infinitely want to mix and remix.  It might be worth it to pay a mastering engineer to master them, especially if you expect to send it out to radio stations. Not that you can't do it yourself, but take one thing out of the equation for you to screw up.   I also cringe when a release date is set before mixes are done, but that's just me."

You've got a label, but they need you to record the album yourself and deliver within 30 days? They have no recommendations for pro studios, mixing or mastering? And you're talking about recording a ""radio hit""? Like ClearChannel / I Heart Media radio? Let me guess, you're going to pay some kind of submission fee to this ""label"", right? You pay the fee and they out your record in the hands of the big labels?  Is it possible to record, mix and master an album in 30 days? Yes. Will it sound professional? Probably not. Maybe if you were dealing with a bunch of absolute pros ... pro musicians, pro engineers and pro mastering. Thirty days with a bunch of amateurs? It's probably gonna sound amateurish.  From the sound of things, I've got similar or better gear than you and 3-6 more albums worth of experience than you. I've been working on my next album for over a year. If I quit my job and started from scratch, I could produce a decent sounding album in 30 days. I would record and mix everything myself, but pay a pro to master. I'm confident it would sound pretty good. Good enough to get on the radio? I don't know.  Bands don't just get on the radio out of nowhere. Time, money or connections ... pick two, cause you need them. Maybe if you had a viral video with over a million views, you'd get on the radio after a month or two. Maybe if your song got used in a popular TV advertisement for Volkswagen or Pepsi. Maybe if your first album was produced by a big name producer, who would likely be co-writing your songs. You seem to have none of those things, and that should be troubling if you're really thinking about getting on the radio."

Regardless, I need to record this album and from the comments, it seems it's split pretty 50/50. Some people are more optimistic and others have the tendency to look down upon recordings by those who don't have years of experience. The radio hit doesn't refer to our success on the airwaves, but more of the sonic quality of the song and it ability to be in commercial setting. Thanks for your reply. I hope I clarified your questions."
audioengineering,3d5gad,sebovzeoueb,2,Mon Jul 13 23:05:36 2015 UTC,"I think what most people are suspicious of is this: you're saying you have little experience, but want to make a record that is of ""radio quality"" sonically. That's not impossible, but it's very unrealistic. The guys who record, mix, and master radio quality songs have spent a ton of time refining their skills. Additionally, for most radio quality songs, it's at least two, but usually more, people that take on each of those roles. The skill set for a mastering engineer is quite different from a recording or mixing engineer.   This question isn't meant to be condescending, buts a a way to relate certain skills that are more familiar: how much time does it take to get really good at playing guitar/drums/etc? Engineering takes just as long. For some people it comes naturally and they are at a pro level a lot faster then others, but regardless it takes hours and hours of experience to get there."

I can also understand occasionally wanting to just take a break on it too, especially if you're not getting paid for the work and you're just doing it at your leisure, but if OP has a deadline and can really focus on the project, I don't see why he wouldn't be able to bang it all out in a month or 2 (but I say this without having any knowledge of OP's skill or how quickly he's able to work, as well as not knowing how long the group will take to buckle down and track everything). That being said, I wouldn't recommend trying to do it all in that amount of time, especially if he's got a full time job as well, because it'll be hell.  I've got a full time job too, with recording as my side business, but on the last album I did (13 tracks) I was able to get everything tracked in two 4-day sessions and then knock out the editing and mixing within the next month and a half. However, I only did that because of a short deadline, it was a way more hectic pace than I normally like to work at. Basically go to work for 8 or 9 hours and then come home and edit/mix for another 4-5 hours every day, plus a full 8-9 hours on most weekends until it was finished. So it's possible, but if OP is working a full time job and expecting to get this all done, he's gonna be in for a SUPER heavy workload."
audioengineering,3d5gad,Sirius_Cyborg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:47:04 2015 UTC,"My album has taken over one year to produce due to line up changes in the band and constantly moving ""goal posts"". This album was supposed to be a 7 song EP, then we fired our lead singer and had two horns quit (we play ska). While we looked for new members, we kept adding new songs to the album until we ended up with 12 tracks. The album isn't finished because I'm still trying to get the new singer into my home studio to finish vocals on 7 / 12 tracks  Obviously, you don't spend more than a year on an album without lots of wasted time. I'm dealing with a 7-member band. The guys in my band are in their mid twenties to late thirties. Everyone has a ""real"" job and we're playing gigs every month. We've been writing new material, auditioning new members. Four of us are married or engaged. I have kids and the original lead singer had kids. Real life just gets in the way. Getting my bandmates into my home studio is my biggest struggle because we're managing so many schedules.  I totally agree that the OP 'can' do everything in 30 days. But it will be difficult and the results might not meet expectations.   I've got a very similar gear list to the OP. I use Logic. I have an 8-channel interface (Saffire Pro40). I have a limited selection of pro quality mics (AKG D112, three SM57s, three MD421s, EV RE20, Rode NT1000 condenser, Cascade stereo ribbon mic). I also seem to have more experience than the OP. I've recorded in pro studios before, I've self released two EPs and a full album prior to working on this latest release for the last year. I know how difficult it would be for me to finish 12 tracks in 30 days and achieve a good result with a similar equipment list to the OP. It would be hard. If OP has never done this before, the result probably won't sound very good. I know my first two EPs sound horrible in retrospect."

It could be done faster and better...Trying to record and mix yourself when you do no those skills is like trying to walk in to a restaurant and cook dinner for 300 people in a night and expect it to be the same quality as the experience chef. Just because you have good gear (or good ingredients) doesn't mean your dish is going to look and taste as good.  Im not saying don't learn and do it yourself, thats all awesome, but set your expectations. If you REALLY have a label interested in your band, they should be willing to offset your production costs or at least provide a draw for it upfront, many have their own studios to limit the cost.  Regardless, if you want the best possible outcome, seriously consider a professional. In the end sometimes it winds up being cheaper and  better than buying gear and trying to figure it out."

audioengineering,3d5gad,moltenrock,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:39:03 2015 UTC,"On top of all the technical stuff you'll be, essentially, managing and prioritizing the recording process.  Do we really need another take, should we try this, should we rework that?  This means that you're the producer and are going to have to make calls based on time and resources, and it's all your time and all your resources once everything is in the can.  So don't take any shit and try to keep everyone on schedule.  Insist on your word being the last word and have a conversation about it beforehand if you need to.  ""Hey, we've got a limited amount of time and I'm the one who's going to be setting most of this up and mixing on the backend.  We're a band, and everybody should have a say about what we're doing and everybody should feel good about the results, but we will have times where we have have to make some decisions about what we do or what we don't do based on our deadline.  I'm going to be the one managing all those technical and post-production issues, so my voice needs to have a lot of weight.  Otherwise we won't make our deadline.""  If your band pushes back in the studio, just remind everyone of the deadline and that we need to stay on track.  ""We can do it again/rework that song/try that experiment but we won't make our deadline, I'll need another X days to compensate.""  Use this to ensure that things go the way you, as a professional, think they should.  Think of it this way, if you don't, you'll blow your deadline, and do everyone a disservice.  If you don't assert yourself, the less skilled are going to be the one's making the decisions, and that's a bad plan.  Also, you should insist on a producer credit.  This isn't a favor to you or a thing the band is gifting you, what you're doing is exactly what a producer does and everyone should know that you're doing it.  I know how these things start.  You're in a band and you're the member that has the most mixing/recording chops, so everything technical becomes your responsibility.  Well, never forget the in-band producer's credo: With great responsibility comes great power.  You're the one who has the skills, and I bet you're not getting any extra money for this right?  So that puts you in the driver's seat / producer's chair.  This gives you authority, so don't be afraid to flex it.  Tell them the technical or time-based reason things should be one way or another and stick to it.  ""We can't just make your guitars louder because X"".  Otherwise, you'll fall into thinking that your band is somehow owed a recording and that since nobody else has the skills, you, somehow owe it to everyone to make the sacrifice.  Nope.  You're the producer they choose, so don't be afraid to produce.  If they start to get really unhappy with your choices or schedule, that's a sign that maybe the band needs to look at hiring a producer they can really get behind; and you can think of that as a win/win.  The band gets the sound they want and you no longer have the responsibility."

I still disagree though, the laws of acoustics are hard wired into your listeners brain and disagreeing with those laws doesn't mean you can turn them off and be exempt. If you do think about that stuff, even in electronic music, my experience is that it lowers the 'listener fatigue' level and increases the acceptance/enjoyment without the listener even knowing why.

The open door is a good thing as the reflection doesn't happen unless there is a surface to reflect from.  Edit: reading your comments again I think you may be looking for reflection points in space where walls would be in a perfect square room. That won't help you because you don't have a perfect square room. Imagine the whole place was made of mirrors, where would you see the monitors from the listening position? That is where to try placing the foam, but let your ears (and less subjectively the measurement mic) be your guide."

From what I've read, if you want to get a good tube influence on the sound, you'll need to replace the stock 12ax7 with a JJ or something comparable, and always use the highest voltage setting.  As for running a preamp into a preamp, it's fine, just mind your gain staging. Start with the redundant pre turned all the way down, no pad, no phantom. It should act like a line input. You may need to turn it up a tad.  And finally, in regards to your cheap interface. Your converters will most likely not be a deal breaker. If you haven't noticed any problems as of yet, using the art pre won't change that. The weak link on any given interface is typically the preamp or noisy circuitry."

audioengineering,3d6xvd,AwHellNawFetaCheese,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:17:42 2015 UTC,"Correct! Though an instrument cable is not the same as a regular TRS Line cable. IIRC Instrument cables usually have a lower impedance, so you'll lose some top end and are generally TS (Tip/Sleeve) only.   Instrument cables should stick to plugging guitars into amps. When patching between pieces of gear you'll want a balance TRS (Tip/Ring/Sleeve) cable.   The tip, ring, and sleeve act as the 3 pins on an XLR and would be wired as such in a cable with TRS on one end XLR on the other if you were to have/need one.  Here is a great example of the kind of interface you're looking for. The Saffire series is great, nicer sounding preamps than its USB counter parts.

Essentially, theres always a bottleneck in the chain and you want to upgrade that component, however after you do that there will be a new bottleneck, and the cycle repeats. So in 5 years I've replaced every part of my signal chain atleast 3 times (I've gone through 6 interfaces).  Though I prefer an external preamp to built-in interface pres, your interface is the hub in which everything gets connected to so it needs to be of quality. Having an interface with quality D/A and A/D convertors is very important.  Essentially what I'm trying to say is, as an example, plugging in a $1500 Neumann into a $100 M-box is a waste of time, disgrace to the microphone and a German will come to your house and smack you. You even have to buy better cables and connectors like Mogami and Neutrik.  Remember your sound is only as good as the weakest part of your signal chain."
audioengineering,3d6xvd,AwHellNawFetaCheese,-1,Wed Jul 15 12:45:48 2015 UTC,"Many people will disagree with me here, but if you are using a condenser mic and have a decent interface, the tube preamp is redundant and will actually degrade the performance of the audio chain. It's true that in some cases the degradation might be pleasing, but it IS degradation, however slight, and proper measurements will show the losses. From an engineering point of view, you are best off having a minimum amount of circuitry in front of the analog-to-digital converter.   Just .02 from a guy who's been doing audio for over 50 years, including at a time when tubes were the only available amplification devices."

It will take balanced or unbalanced, but you'll want an RCA->1/4"" TS (tip-sleeve) adapter.  Avoid RCA->TRS adapters, I've seen some of them that have the hot on the RCA end connected to both the tip and ring which will result in absolutely no audio if plugged into a balanced input."

All the tape saturation and compression happens from overdriving the signal as it hits the tape. That's what you want.  So... Since you can't monitor the tape distortion in real time, you'll have do a test run at different levels onto the tape. As you do your test to tape, slightly increase the volume level every time the loop repeats. Jot down the volume level for each loop. Listen back to the tape and find out which volume level sounds best to you. Look at your notes and find the corresponding volume level. Use that level to record your final pass.   The level coming off the tape recorder into the DAW should be as loud as it can be without clipping.   Keep in mind the tape will skew with the tempo slightly. So if you've already recorded other tracks to the drum loop you might have to do some editing to get everything to stay in time."

You can hit the tape fairly hard like 0 to +3.  What I would do is experiment with the gain coming out of the sampler.  So, connect your sampler, assuming stero L/R to the 4 track to tracks 1 & 2.  Roll tape and start increasing the pre amps on those channels till your saturation and peaking around +3db.  listen to the playback and see where about you like the sound.  Once you are getting the effect you want, record the whole sample with that gain set up.  once you have the ""gritty"" recording on tape, run it back into your DAW the way you would record everything else in the digital domain, don't clip! Should sound compressed and somewhat warmer.  Experiment and have fun!  Edited for shitty punctuation."

Put some saturation on the clean guitar (kindof does much of the same things as a limiter) and maybe boost the mids with an EQ if necessary. Obviously the trick is to make the clean one sound as loud as the other without sounding distorted. Always compare the two guitars Regarding the width.. since the distorted guitars are doubled they kindof sound ""larger"".. so use some ping pong delay too to widen up the clean guitar.

This is just a guess, but the send may be causing the delay rather than the plug in itself.   Rather than using a send, try to duplicate the track itself, and put the compressor on that. Then bring that channel up. I'd be curious if you continue to have the latency with that configuration.   The H-Comp by waves is a great all around compressor that has a dry/wet knob for parallel compression. Every now and then it goes on sale for $50 or so."
audioengineering,3d1o4j,LinkLT3,0,Sun Jul 12 20:21:56 2015 UTC,Yeah its weird how they haven't fixed that but it might be the 32 to 64bit converter is the culprit.  Then again i just noticed i can adjust the bus to be a Pre- rather than Post-Fader.. That would technically bypass all the plugins and their latencies before sending it..
audioengineering,3d1o4j,WolfAudio,3,Sun Jul 12 20:48:54 2015 UTC,"Pre-fader and post fader is just that. Neither of those modes is going to bypass your plugins.   Pre-fader is typically used for headphone feeds so that when you are mixing down during tracking, the musicians are not aware of that, and they can have their own independent mixes.   Post-fader is typically used for processing effects, so that the effect follows a track's mix level."
audioengineering,3d1o4j,jacksonprince,0,Mon Jul 13 03:39:15 2015 UTC,Yeah sure but are you talking about Logic X? it seems to work differently when you assign your bus knob to work in PreFader mode. They use the same terms kindof wrong.. Like ez. the Pan -knob really is Balance...

The reason I ask is this; if your faders are set to unity, they are neither boosting or attenuating your clipped audio before it gets to your master buss. If you have multiple channels of clipped audio hitting the master buss at the same time, the clipping is going to be  quite extreme (more than if just one channel). Try to move your channel faders to -6.0 dB (or until the master buss no longer clips), and leave your master fader at unity.

audioengineering,3czhj2,badhaireday,7,Sun Jul 12 04:49:19 2015 UTC,"Actually, if the recording was done more or less conventionally (vocals up the middle without too much reverb or other time based effects), you can get most of the lead vocal out of a stereo track without a lot of trouble.  It has been done ever since there have been stereo records, and in fact, there have been a number of boxes sold to people who wanted to ""remove"" the vocal and sing to their favorite songs.  One of them was called the ""Thompson Vocal Eliminator,"" and was pretty widely available in the 70's, when I was first coming up as an engineer.  The principle works on the phase relationship between the two sides of the stereo track, and if you have a stereo editing program or DAW like Pro Tools or Logic or really anything that will let you work with the stereo waveform, it's really simple.  What you do is separate the stereo track into the left and right component parts.  Then, you flip the phase, or polarity of ONE of the sides in reference to the other side, and then combine the two sides back in MONO.  What this will do is cancel out all of the information that is common to BOTH of the tracks, leaving only what is individual to each track.  So, what you will lose will be center track information, like the bass, kick drum, AND VOCAL.  What the Thompson Vocal Eliminator did was just that, and then introduced a bass boost circuit after the phase flip and mono combination to try to make up for the lack of bass that resulted when the phase was flipped.  You can also do this using an analog console if you have a phase reversal switch on the line inputs.  Just put the left and right of the stereo signal into two faders, put one fader out of phase, pan both of them straight up, and voila!, vocals, bass, kick, and anything else that was in the middle will disappear.  You will still hear the vocal reverb, which tends to be hard panned, but the main vocal will be gone.  Have fun!!  EDIT:  I Googled it out of curiousity, and it turns out they still make the Thompson Vocal Eliminator.  I listened to the ""Standards,"" and especially on Sinatra, where there wasn't a lot of bass or reverb, it works great!!  http://www.ltsound.com/eliminator.htm  EDIT 2:  Of course, what you are left with is a MONO track with a tiny bit of original vocal reverb.  So it all depends on what you are trying to do.  If you just need something to practice to, then this works like a charm.  But if you are trying to end up with something that you can cut a new vocal to and use as a master, then you are, as the previous commenters suggested, SOL."

Time delay and intensity difference work as you'd expect and can easily be mapped to headphones as they allow you to choose exactly what's going to each ear. HRTF has to do with the way the shape of your head (particularly the outer ear) filters the sound as it comes in - the frequency response is different depending on the direction the sound is coming from. Virtual surround sound aims to emulate HRTF frequency patterns (as well as the obvious delay/amplitude panning).

audioengineering,3cslcb,jophenese,6,Fri Jul 10 17:53:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not on the best of speakers at the moment but that sounds just like multiple takes of the harmonies, no effects required. When you layer good performances of a good musical arrangements with themselves, it can create a phasey, ""thick"" sound in the upper harmonics. Queen's chorus vocals are another good example. Some Beach Boys records are another. Be aware the ""tightness"" of the sound really depends on the performance ability and the musical arrangement.  EDIT: For an extreme example of what you can do with this technique, check out the making of 10cc's ""I'm Not In Love"".  EDIT2: I realized you may be talking about the lead vox. That sounds like a very short room verb or delay mixed to taste.  FINAL EDIT: OK. Got some headphones and realized the stereo imaging. The lead vox and the lead vox delay are panned hard left and right. Likewise, the background vocals are multitracked and panned pretty hard as well. Be sure to check your mono compatibility when playing with these ideas as you might have some parts that will cancel out if you are not careful."
audioengineering,3cslcb,_scribbleman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:04:16 2015 UTC,Great observations! I'm going to play with all the ideas. I'm thinking of also trying out a vocal with midsize technique to see if that's what's giving it the phasey stereo image.

audioengineering,3cslcb,TheGreatAuseil,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:56:31 2015 UTC,You'll have to forgive me for not having an audio example-- I'm on mobile. However I hear this in a number of current pop and edm songs: there's a sound that is apparently mono but my brain interprets it as coming from both headphones instead of right down the centre. I've experimented with various short delays and that gets me closer but it still doesn't feel hard panned left AND right. Thank you in advance for any insight.
audioengineering,3cslcb,BrockHardcastle,5,Fri Jul 10 14:53:16 2015 UTC,"Without an example it's tough to tell. But it could be Mid-Side processing, just pulling out the mids (or at least reducing them). It could also be one copy hard left, one copy hard right, one down the middle. The one to the left is down -2 cents (or -3, or -4) and the one on the right is up +2 cents (again, or +3 or +4)   This can make a mono source sound huge. Works great on vocals too."

audioengineering,3cslcb,BurningCircus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:33:59 2015 UTC,"I think the mid-side with no mid hypothesis is most likely. The easiest way to generate this sound is to copy the source, pan the two hard left/right, and phase invert one side. This will give the impression that the sound is ""in your head"" rather than in front of you. Interestingly, it's the same technique that's used with the sides of MS, but without the mid track for your ears to reference, it just sounds weird."

This lets you play with the bleed channels which will give you the ability to vary even more of a room sound. If you want the most choice possible, use all 4 room mics on the initial mixer and have them all available. Usually I won't use all of the available room mics on the final mix but it's good to have some options. Ultimately the best thing to do is parallel compress the room mics and overheads and make sure you EQ them to take out the unnecessary low end. Good compression on the room mics will really bring them out and give them sustain. I'll usually always use a slow release. Just make sure you keep your levels adjusted so you don't lose too much presence in your kick/snare/toms. To avoid that I'll separate the kick and snare from my drum bus and mix them in as if they are their own separate instruments unrelated to the drums."

That snare is all natural and live. I actually copied some of his answers down:  ""Snare in SD2.0: ""Try a compressor with a hard knee, 3-4:1 ratio, 15-35ms attack, 100-150ms release (too fast on the release will work against the effect), aiming for 4-8dB of gain reduction.""  ""Try boosting a healthy amount of 175-200Hz into the snare, a 8-12k shelf boost, then add 3-5k to taste. Follow that up with a Distressor, SSL Channel compressor or CompX, always using a slow attack and fast release, and run it through some sort of saturation stage. 1176 in parallel  will bring the tone of the snare out, and feed plenty of reverb to this parallel bus as well to get it to interact with the hit in that ""explosive"" manner. A big snare ambience sample is often needed too.  Consistent snare = clipped and/or saturated. Try putting clipper before and after compressor: if before, compressor reacts 100% equally to all hits!""  ""Alex puts a pair of mics outside his drum room aimed outwards into a hallway/staircase. They still sound quite dry, so I used a transient designer plugin with the ""sustain"" control set to full to make them sound much bigger. On the back end of the room track channels I have have an expander that is keyed from the snare channel so ambience jumps up in volume whenever the snare hits, a little bit like the classic gated snare reverb trick - this is something I do in more or less all of my drum mixes with decent natural room tracks.""  ""I send all tracks to the parallel buss but more of the snare and toms than anything else (I usually send a lot less of the OH/spot mics, and any really sub-heavy kick tracks too). I use a fast FET-type compressor that flattens the transient and brings out the sustain/body/ambience of the drums; without the parallel compression, the guitars and other instruments tend to eat up all of the body of the drums and leave you with spiky sounding ""ticks"" and ""pops"". When mastering I generally mono-ise the frequencies below ~100Hz Snare - Shure Beta 57A (top), Shure SM57 (bottom)""  It's also that Matt Halpern hits his snare REALLY fucking hard, which is tough to emulate in Superior without machine-gunning all the velocities at 127."

audioengineering,3cudo8,xdz,6,Fri Jul 10 21:20:56 2015 UTC,"Hi xdz,   I think you may be confusing a number of topics with each other but I'll try to be more helpful than Mr. Professional below.   Unfortunately your USB interface only provides 16 volts of phantom power, and your microphone requires 48 volts. I believe your microphone is an electret design, meaning the back plate of the diaphragm is permanently charged. This also means that the 48 volts is only used for the amplifier that is inside the microphone. In other words, the amplifier in your microphone is not receiving the voltage supply that it needs to operate. You have two options. 1) Find a dynamic microphone that does not require phantom power or 2) You will need to find a new interface that can supply the 48 volts your condenser microphone requires. I'm sure that is frustrating considering Behringer says that the mixer supplies phantom power, which most companies set at a standard 48 volts, but they apparently don't.   If your interested in how microphones and interfaces (their mic pres) will work with each other, two important specs to look at is your microphone output impedance, and your microphone preamplifier input impedance. If your microphone has an output impedance of 100 ohms the rule of thumb is that the input impedance of your microphone preamplifier should be 10x that amount (1000 ohms). The reason for this rule is to maintain the intended frequency response of your microphone. If you stray from this rule, coloration will be added to the microphones sound (which could be cool too!)."
audioengineering,3cudo8,WolfAudio,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:20:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation, I appreciate it.   I had a feeling it was something to do with my  interface. I mean it does work, and I can record myself but I'm very quiet and there is a bit of a hiss to it. I guess I'll be looking into replacements.   Now about the way mics and interfaces work together. If the output of a mic is 100 ohms then the interface should 10x that. What about a different situation, if headphones are say 200ohms, what are the 'recommended' specs for the interface, or does the same rule apply?"
audioengineering,3cudo8,WolfAudio,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:09:08 2015 UTC,"No problem xdz.   In regards to microphones and interfaces. You've got the right idea! Just remember that it's not the interface itself that has an input impedance specification but the microphone preamplifier inside the interface.   With headphones and headphone amplifiers it is a similar rule of thumb, but its backwards. Typically you want the headphone amplifier output impedance to be 1/8 of the headphone input impedance. So if you have headphones that are 200 ohms, you will want to drive them with an amplifier that has a output impedance of 25 ohms. Ideally you want the amplifier output impedance to be as close to zero as possible, but most companies don't don't meet that spec unless your investing in a dedicated headphone amp.   For instance I have a headphone amp that has a output impedance of 12 ohms, and my headphones have an input impedance of 62 ohms. Ideally my headphone amp would be (62/8) = 7.75 ohms, but it's close enough. I'm closer to 1/5 but hey, I'm not going to spend the extra money to play by the rules when I'm probably not going to notice a significant difference.   Definitely things to think about when your investing in gear!   And if you want an depth understanding of impedance check out this article below. NwAvGuy is excellent!   http://nwavguy.blogspot.com/2011/02/headphone-amp-impedance.html  Good luck on your audio journey!"
audioengineering,3cudo8,SuperRusso,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:17:24 2015 UTC,"Wow, they shouldn't say it can produce Phantom Power if it can't produce actual 48 volts.  This is very misleading."
audioengineering,3cudo8,fuzeebear,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:41:26 2015 UTC,Phantom power and impedance are two separate things.  Most likely the preamps you have are subpar.
audioengineering,3cudo8,fuzeebear,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:34:20 2015 UTC,"Could you elaborate on that a bit? I should have mentioned that I'm not very knowledgeable when it come to this stuff.

Or if I owned the headphones already, how would I know what audio interface I needed for them?"
audioengineering,3cudo8,dswpro,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:43:18 2015 UTC,"If your preamps are not very good, then you will have a high noise floor and not much gain. That seems to be the case. But you should test another condenser mic with the interface, as well as test the mic you have with a different interface. That will help you narrow down the cause."

audioengineering,3csrhe,oynaz,2,Fri Jul 10 16:34:21 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I can only think that a sample of one of your samples might help here. I mean you could do the standard second track with some amp modeling on it, or simply compress it and add a subtle phaser or delay or reverb to it and mix it low with the original signal.

audioengineering,3csrhe,IamTheFreshmaker,3,Fri Jul 10 18:23:37 2015 UTC,"If I am reading correctly what you want is a way for your recorded-by-you sounds to fit in with some sampled, more 'roomy' or 'live' sounding bits. Take your recorded track, copy it, then start by adding coloring to that second track, like compression or amp modeling or whatever then mix the first and second tracks together until you get something that sounds a bit different. It may help the 'dryness' of those in the box recordings to fit better. You could also do some sidechain gate, eq or compression to get the tracks to 'feed' off of one another. Also never forget the power of the simple pan.  Sidechaining made easy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOmy9YAkhNc  And that porcess I mentioned is called reamping or something. It's done when you want a more complex tone out of guitars/bass- you basically just create another track from the source using a different amp. We used to do Fender -> Marshall blends all the time with a slight pan right on the Fender- just to give the guitar a really complete sound."

Somewhere in the middle is where you want to be. If you're using a dynamic mic, you won't be able to pick up the nuances of a piano due to their lack of sensitivity, and boosting the input level won't get you to where you want to be before clipping. Using a condenser mic or two will pick up the full range of the piano while recording at a nominal level."

audioengineering,3crc5u,ratava911,3,Fri Jul 10 04:08:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with ratava911. Once you get both performances tuned well with each other and your editing finished, start high passing your ""double"" until the low end cleans up. At that point I would use the fader to find a balance between the two. Also try sending them both to the same delay effect buss, and processing them in parallel. Then gently bring up your delay buss into the mix and see how that works."
audioengineering,3crc5u,WolfAudio,2,Fri Jul 10 05:12:36 2015 UTC,Try sidechain compressing the doubled take to the main take so youre only working off the transients of one take but can than still use the sustain portion of the doubled vox. I use a similar technique with my vocal delay channel.
audioengineering,3crc5u,Bantertrack,3,Fri Jul 10 14:35:33 2015 UTC,"I think people recommend sidechain compression too often. I  this case, it won't do anything useful, since it is multiple versions of the same passage. The timing and dynamic behavior will be very close, so sidechain compression will do the same thing as regular compression."
audioengineering,3crc5u,fuzeebear,2,Fri Jul 10 23:56:42 2015 UTC,"Ordinary compression would actually be preferable in this instance, because the goal is to squash the transients on the double track every time. If there's any discrepancy in performance or how the tracks are aligned, a side chained compressor would squash the wrong part."
audioengineering,3crc5u,Hard6Rollin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:32:49 2015 UTC,"I see where you are coming from but I disagree. Because the timing should be so close, the transients can become deemphasized by the doubling. When i'm doubling vocals I'm ussually looking to accentuate the sustain and the mid region of the vocal. So to clarify I typically sidechain compress the presence region, not the whole sound. To each their own, but I do feel you."

I want the lead vocal track to give me the full package; sibilances body and all. If I pull in doubles, I usually cut the sibilances out with EQ so they don't catch your ear and the focus stays on the main center vox track. If it's a louder and brighter poppy mix I could imagine leaving a little more highs in to widen it up, if there is a lot going on in the mix."

audioengineering,3crc5u,view-master,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:56:33 2015 UTC,Current country vocals sound horrible IMHO. Incredibly obvious tuning going on. For doubles you have to start with a good (consistent) singer. Make a copy of your main track and EQ it to make it as sibilant as possible but don't add ANY compression (this track will be muted in the end). use that track to trigger a side chain compressor on the doubled track. The idea is to have it duck out on consonants. Then do some low pass filtering on the double.
audioengineering,3crc5u,drcasino,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:24:34 2015 UTC,"all of these ideas sounds kind of crazy.   Get a good doubled performance, with accurate pitch and phrasing.

audioengineering,3cr687,sunshineparadigm,5,Fri Jul 10 02:55:33 2015 UTC,"The only time a microphone is going to be hard to mix is because  1) it was not the right microphone for the job 2) poor microphone technique  3) poor room acoustics   I listened to your microphone shoot out and honestly none of them shine out as ""the one"".   The main problem with your recording is that it sounds like the vocals were recorded in a small room (which will be your main nuisance during mixing, not frequency response of the microphone).   A recording is a ratio of direct to reverberant sound. Sometimes a direct sound is the goal (modern pop music), and sometimes a balance of direct and reverberant sound is ideal (classical). For the style of music that you are working with a more direct sound is going to be your friend during mix down. I would recommend finding a room that is a little less reflective and re-recording. Also watch how close you are to the microphone because there is some low mid  resonance in your voice that is being boosted by proximity effect."

audioengineering,3cr687,AvionKeys,2,Fri Jul 10 12:57:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you could really use any of those. No mic is truly ""bad"" for vocals (though some may be bad for the vocal you're trying to capture in a particular song, and some mics are just crappy in general, so you don't buy them). As long as you can identify the good/bad points of whatever mic you're using and effectively correct them, the mix will sound fine (e.g. I've got a mic that peaks around 14k, but overall it's got a pretty good sound, so I just tweak my EQ a little bit around 14K until the levels sound appropriate for the song and then mix as usual)  Other than that, what WolfAudio said. Either find a different room or treat the room a bit better. Even something as simple as hanging a few blankets or throwing some pillows around would be a start."

If two microphones is the only option, I would experiment with distance from the performers so that the two sound sources (piano and vocals) compliment each other.

If you want to be a boom op, there is absolutely NO need for you to go to school for anything.  In all seriousness, don't enroll in shit.   However, understand that as a boom op, you will not be recording music or sound effects.  Just dialog on movie sets.  Now, if you want to record sound effects, you may want to be a foley engineer or artist.  Sound effects (gunshots, door slams, etc...) are cut from libraries.  Nobody is really recording those things anymore.  But movement based sounds are still recorded.  That's called Foley.  Again, Don't go to school.  Waste of money.  If you want to record music, then move to LA and get an internship at a studio that records music.  Again, don't go to school.  How do I know?  Well, I started life not going to school and becoming a successful recording engineer out in LA.  I worked at some of the finest studios out there.  After I got bored of that, I went to Hawaii and ran sound on cruise ships for a while.  Then, I came back to Louisiana and started work as a Production Sound mixer, Foley engineer and artist, and editor.  Here is an AMA I did a year or two back.  https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kvp33/iama_an_on_set_movie_sound_mixer_ama/  I did that while I was on set.    I think you are confused as to what the various positions are in audio, but whatever you choose, don't bother with school.  If you have any other questions though, feel free to ask!"
audioengineering,3cpc10,SuperRusso,2,Thu Jul 9 18:28:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I've heard about foley engineers before... My first guess would be that its a very over-saturated field, but I literally have no experience in this field whatsoever so I could be completely wrong.   Producing music isn't a pure hobby or interest of mine, but I have always wanted to see what direction I could take if I actually dedicated my self to something in the audio field.   How would I go about applying for boom operator jobs without any prior experience? Lie similarly to how you did on your ama?  I'm not positive if being a boom op is what I certainly want, I just saw it as an interesting foot in the door audio position I can see myself actually enjoying for a while."
audioengineering,3cpc10,delonasn,4,Fri Jul 10 00:11:45 2015 UTC,"Pursuing it as a hobby may be more fulfilling.  I too have a BA in philosophy.  After graduating, I went back to school full time to study music for two years.  I then tried to make a living as a musician, but I didn't enjoy giving lessons nor playing cover songs, so that didn't work out.  I eventually taught myself audio engineering and it is a seriously important part of my life, but I know I will never make any money at it and don't care.  Hobbies can make life worth living just as well as careers.  When my wife became pregnant way back when, I seriously rethought my priorities and went back to graduate school to study business and information systems.  These were really alien subjects to me, but I knew they had financial utility.  Got two masters degrees and now work mostly as a computer programmer, which is low stress and pays reasonably well.  I think separating making a living from what I really enjoy doing was a decent life decision for me.  That said, I do know people who stuck to the arts.  Very few are making much money, though if you can live really modestly, it can be a good life.  I have a friend who performs for a living.  He lives in a rented garage and drives a car held together by duct tape, but he's pretty happy.  Not everyone would be happy with that and he will never marry.

audioengineering,3cplyl,ratbut,7,Thu Jul 9 19:33:27 2015 UTC,"Well, if you only have 1 guitar track it's going to be hard to do something that doesn't sound a little weird. If you do happen to have the possibility to double the guitar parts, then I would recommend doing that. By doubling I mean recording the same part again, this will introduce small differences with the original part. Then you can pan one hard left and one hard right for a much larger guitar sound than just the one track.  The other thing you can do is go full old-school and hard pan all the things. It does sound kind of weird, as it's not what we're used to any more, but I quite like it. Check out this Doors track for example. The drums and keys are panned really far left, organ and guitar really strongly to the right, vocals in the middle (but maybe panned a bit too). It certainly creates some space in the mix, although is really unconventional by today's standards. I think this approach is especially good when you have mono drums like you do.  If you're going to do weird panning I'd suggest going all out, don't just pan stuff a little bit, really give everything its own place in the stereo field. I would generally put the vocals in the centre and fit everything around them, assuming vocals are the ""lead"" element of your music. You should play around to see what you prefer, but I would maybe try drums on one side, guitar on the other and vocals and bass in the middle. It's generally quite good to keep bass near the middle, although you can have a low passed bass track centred and a high passed one panned, this keeps the low end weight balanced, while allowing you to place the bassist somewhere else.  Let me know if you have any questions about what I've just said. You can check out this recording I made messing around with some friends a few years ago, in which I basically did exactly what I described above. Vocals and bass down the middle, acoustic guitar on the left, drums on the right, and the electric guitar stuff hard left, quite a similar number of tracks to what you're working with."
audioengineering,3cplyl,sebovzeoueb,2,Thu Jul 9 20:12:39 2015 UTC,"The simplest approach would be to work on the individual tracks that sound like they need help or need to spread out.  For instance, your guitar track can be copied multiple times and spread out at various points in the stereo field. Then, assign various frequencies to the individual tracks: This copy guitar will be the low end, I'll cut off all the high frequencies. This copy guitar will handle mid-range, I'll cut off everything else. Etc. Add some distortion to some, a little reverb to another, try leaving something dry and in your face. If there's a particular track you want to emphasize, look for the EQ frequency where it is particularly active and then bring that frequency down a little in the other tracks. Like the man said, ""record playfully, edit scientifically.""  Using multiple copies of the same track can cause other issues, like phase cancellation. So check your playback in mono where those issues will become more obvious.  You can do this to any of your recorded tracks, unless you're using a cassette-multitrack recorder to record punk bands like I used to do."
audioengineering,3cplyl,financewiz,2,Thu Jul 9 20:01:56 2015 UTC,"It's hardcore so you probably want to avoid doing too much.  Everything down the center is fine.  Google ""back to mono"".  If you want to get wild though, maybe try a delay or reverb panned hard L or R with your guitar hard the other way.  Reverb and delay ain't really in the classic 80's hardcore recipe.  You could also try leaving everything mono but some stereo reverb."
audioengineering,3cplyl,dogfightgiggle,2,Thu Jul 9 20:10:15 2015 UTC,"I'd just bounce it to stereo and then set everything in the stereo field as if you had a punk band in front of you. Whatever the band looks like on stage, just aim to replicate that in sound."
audioengineering,3cplyl,my_cat_joe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:10:38 2015 UTC,"In theory there's nothing wrong with mixing in mono, it certainly keeps everything in phase, but adding some width can be nice. I'd setup a nice stereo room reverb to add some subtle width to everything, and place everything in the same environment. Keep drums centered, and add a touch of verb until they feel 'natural' - be gentle, you don't want washy drums, just a sense of presence. Vocals I'd also keep centered (unless you have whisper sections, which might be nice to pan out), add a pinch of room verb to place them in the same environment as the other instruments, and then delay/plate etc as you see fit (which can also add some more width).   I see two ways of working with the guitars - either keep bass in the middle, and ADT or shredspread the guitar to give width, or pan both out each way to taste, and mono sum everything on both below about 200Hz. Then add a bit of that same natural room verb to taste to get everything tied together.  Mix as you would otherwise in regards to EQ/dynamics/etc, and keep it simple to keep it feeling raw.  I have a feeling it's against sub rules to advertise our services, else I'd offer you my services as a mix engineer."
audioengineering,3cplyl,LakaSamBooDee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:01:27 2015 UTC,"Having double-tracked guitars to pan them is the usual way to go, but not the only way to go.  You can also make the 2nd ""guitar"" track be the bass!  If the bass is clean, clone it to a different track, distort it and hi-pass it at 100-200Hz and pan if hard to one side. Now you can pan the guitar to the other side and it won't sound as weird. Rage Against The Machine does that a lot.  If the bass is already distorted, you can split it into two tracks, one hi-passed (150-250Hz) the other lo-passed at the same point. The lo-passed track stays in the middle, the hi-passed one goes to one side.  The classic example of Van halen was keeping the guitar on one side, but having its echo trail be on the other side."
audioengineering,3cplyl,Badside,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:53:24 2015 UTC,"Mono mixes sound great. If you want to get a more spacious sound and you can't use more mics at one time, use what you have as ""scratch"" tracks and re-record everything individually over top so you could have 4 mic's on the drums (kick/snare/Overheads). Then double the guitars. Remove the scratch tracks and you are left with completely isolated instruments. Then you can do things like-if there is a guitar only intro- pan the guitar hard left and when the band comes in bring in the other guitar track hard right, it'll sound huge. I'd be interested in mixing it if you'd like to send me the files.  Edit: I would avoid the advice of panning the drums/bass to one side and the guitar/vox to the other. Give it a try because it won't hurt any thing but in my humble opinion that sounds weird in a bad way. The Beatles did it when they were first experimenting with stereo because it was uncharted territory."

So, the output of your mic lines is a row over the input of your pres.  The output of your pres is a row above the input of your interface, etc.  This way, you won't need patch cables all the time.   And yeah, you can patch a mic snake into the back of a patchbay TRS.  Connectors are just connectors.    You've got the right idea, just read up on normaling and you'll be fine."
audioengineering,3cpbmp,SuperRusso,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:36:26 2015 UTC,Phantom power becomes an issue if the patch bay is bus-grounded. The grounds need to be isolated from chassis on the channels that have mic signals coming through them for the phantom.

audioengineering,3cpbmp,t-bass,2,Thu Jul 9 20:44:47 2015 UTC,"What does it being a multi million dollar studio have to do with it? A 1/4 patchbay passing phantom is the same no matter where it's installed.   2nd, you will not blow up a condenser using a 1/4 patch bay.  I use TT in my studio, which is essentially the same connector with a smaller form factor.  Before that, I used 1/4.  Never, and I mean never, has it caused one problem.  The suggestion it would is silly to the point of asinine."
audioengineering,3cpbmp,SuperRusso,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:19:46 2015 UTC,"Okay, this has moved beyond opinion to potentially being dangerous. Stop with this bullshit man. You haven't earned that Professional flair if you're saying these things. We're talking about a small/bedroom studio here, not a pro studio with pro procedures and expensive everything. There is literally no benefit to him using a TRS patchbay for mics here, but all kinds of potential problems.   Here, let me educate you, or  here, or here or any of hundreds of other examples.  If you're lazy, here's the meat of the SoS link:  ""Can I plug my microphones through a patchbay?  Patching microphone circuits from the studio floor to the desired mixer channel is one of the most useful aspects of a jackfield, although there are potential problems since, if phantom power is being supplied from the desk through the jackfield, patching a mic can damage the console.  As the jack plug is inserted into the jackfield its tip will momentarily connect with the ring contact in the socket, while the ring of the plug touches the sleeve contact. This short-circuits the phantom supply, bridging the +48V line straight to the earth return and, although the phantom supply should cope, the resulting voltage spike can cause irreparable damage to the input circuitry of the mixer channel. The mic input stage can be destroyed outright (particularly with older types of electronically balanced inputs) but it is more usual to find a gradual degradation in performance as various circuit components deteriorate.  Also, unless the patchbay labelling is extremely clear (see page 128), it is all too easy to plug a line source into a microphone input accidentally. If you are lucky the result will be a loud and horribly distorted signal, but it is possible for the phantom power on the mic sockets to destroy the output stage of the line source you are trying to connect!  There are a couple of solutions to these problems. Ideally the phantom power should be turned off while patching, although many mixers hide the phantom switches on the back of the mixer where you can't get at them easily. Many of the better budget mixers (such as the latest XDR Mackie consoles, for example) have mic inputs which have been specifically designed to withstand hot-patching of mics. However, this still doesn't protect against plugging line sources into mic sockets.  If you are concerned about this kind of accident, a reasonably practical alternative (and one I personally recommend) is to patch the mics on a dedicated XLR patchbay -- Canford Audio, for example, can supply suitable panels. XLR sockets are designed so that the earth connector (pin 1) contacts first, with the two signal pins connecting fractionally later, thus avoiding any chance of the phantom supply being shorted. The contacts are also much better suited to delicate microphone signals, and you cannot accidentally plug a line-source jack plug into an XLR socket! In most broadcast studios the usual practice is to supply phantom power direct to the studio wall points, which is an alternative method of avoiding having phantom power across the jackfield.""  Stop being obtuse."

Most pro studios use TT patchbays because they're better, for so many reasons. How the ground is wired on a patchbay absolutely effects wether or not you can safely use phantom power. The phone company use to use TT cables/connectors. It's where the term originated, it stands for ""Tiny Telephone"".    Just because you learned one studios gear/setup, doesn't mean that knowledge is applicable to everyone else's situation.

audioengineering,3cpbmp,t-bass,4,Thu Jul 9 20:31:27 2015 UTC,"What?  What in the fuck are you talking about?  That won't hurt anything.  All you have to do is get B type 1/4 patch cables.  Look:  http://oceanstudiosburbank.com/Ocean_Testing/main.html  I used to work there.  See that large patchbay in the picture after the animation?  It's a 1/4 patch bay, huge on the wall, that phantom runs through.  This is how the phone company used to work.    XLR patchbay?  TRS for the rest?  Boy, the XLR to 1/4 patch cables you must have lying around must be a pain in the ass.    The other solution is to be a pro and not turn on phantom until you've made the patch.  But with B type 1/4, doesn't really matter."
audioengineering,3cpbmp,SuperRusso,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:33:45 2015 UTC,"I think what t-bass is trying to get at is that yes you can, and many do, use 1/4"" patchbays to pass phantom power but it can be a problem that can cause issues especially if the grounds become compromised.  This can cause other mics to have issues with stray voltage getting in places it shouldn't.  Even worse is the fact that 1/4"" connectors briefly short the pins carrying phantom and that can cause very loud and damaging pops.  So someone who is unfamiliar with how 1/4"" wiring works might engage phantom before patching.  Or they are quickly swapping pres in a patch bay and don't turn off phantom before hot swapping.  Bad things can happen which is why best practice says to use an XLR patch bay.  The problem with XLR patch bays though is that they don't usually have a way to provide the normalling capabilities that a 1/4"" connector does so it becomes a hassle to have to patch everything.  This is why you see more 1/4"" bays than XLR for mics in pro studios, the engineers usually know well enough not to hot patch a phantom signal.   For example  the Redco patchbays have switches to change not only the normalling but also the power grounding.  For bays destined for mic to pre duties redco recommends putting every mic to pre connection to vertically strapped ground.  This helps to mitigate any problems that might arise from a compromised grounding situation.    But yeah 1/4"" patch bay are the standard in most pro studios for better or worse."

I have heard that the TT patch bays tend to last longer, but they do require you to solder all the connections, or hire someone to do so. Also for that reason, they are a little more permanent."

audioengineering,3cp3gk,rightanglerecording,3,Fri Jul 10 01:40:26 2015 UTC,No rules man.  just fool around until you like what you hear.  But be mindful that the order in which you place the effects in the chain will have a drastic difference.
audioengineering,3cp3gk,SuperRusso,2,Thu Jul 9 18:22:34 2015 UTC,"It really depends what the desired end result is. Generally I would say eq before compression (I would usually do my cuts pre comp so that I don't end up with unwanted frequencies hitting the threshold), and then that into delay/reverb (don't forget that you can also send your delay into your verb). I would definitely put a transient shaper higher up in the signal chain since you're changing the actual adsr of the sound.   But I mean, none of this is a hard and fast rule. All the effects are just tools; you can put them wherever you want, it really depends on what you're trying to do. Without any sort of scenario  (even a hypothetical one would do), it's impossible to tell you exactly the order you should put things in the signal chain. Also, keep in mind that things don't need to be in a completely linear signal flow, it's entirely possible to route certain effects in parallel, ie: reverb, delay, or even compression (new York compression).  Anyways, if you gave more of an example of what you're trying to achieve, it would be easier to help you out."
audioengineering,3cp3gk,Ka-Hing,2,Thu Jul 9 17:33:57 2015 UTC,Usually it goes  Filter - eq - comp - distortion - delay - reverb  But obviously play around with it
audioengineering,3cp3gk,lunarlon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:53:34 2015 UTC,"Experiment!  No real rules.  But know that the order will affect the sound.  Example, if you are going to hi-pass and compress, you'll almost always want the compressor AFTER the hi-pass filter.  Otherwise, those unwanted low frequencies would be triggering the compressor.  I wouldn't usually do saturation after a delay or reverb, unless I'm going for a specific effect.  Oh and play with some light compression after delay/reverbs, it can really smooth things out."
audioengineering,3cp3gk,dofarrell313,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:21:11 2015 UTC,Just think about the different options when you're processing stuff. And try to stick to a general routine so your gain structure is always consistent. Generally speaking I like to hold off on anything like reverb/delays/phasers until I have the sound where I want it level and frequency wise. So those sorts of plug ins will be last in the chain and 9/10 on an aux track fed from the last point in my chain on the channel. The chain structure I typically use is something like; Width & Amplitude(panning/wideners/gain) -> Transient Control(gates/trans shapers/FAST/light comp) -> Filtering(eq/filters/creative sidechain compressing etc) -> Dynamic Range Adjustments(Harder compressors/saturation/limiting/expansion).

USB, Firewire, or PCIe.  Specifically, I'm choosing between a few different Focusrite products (Scarlett 18i20, Saffire PRO 40, or Liquid Saffire 56), or an RME Raydat.  I'm inclined to think the RME will give me the lowest latency and most stable driver performance, but I have concerns that the ADAT interface into mic pres and line outs will add latency.  I currently have a Presonus Digimax FS, and would probably add/upgrade to Behringer ADA8200s.  I also have a good PCIe firewire card I used with my Firestudio until it took a dump on me.

It's not full range, and the limiter kicks in too easily. The PSM300 that replaced it is much improved.  Consumer grade wireless headphones can actually sound good, the problem with them is latency, they can have over 20ms of latency for some models, which is an issue for performing live music, and the reason systems like the PSM200 exists (zero latency)."

The only way I see this working it like this:  2 computers : Firepod to comp A(main), focusrite to comp B. In Comp B, setup 4 channels in the DAW for each of the 4 inputs. Then route output of those to the spdif output. Since it's stereo, pan 2 tracks hard left, and 2 hard right. You'll be summing 4 channels into 2 but at least you'll have them. Then connect the spdif out on the scarlet to the spdif in on the firepod.   Computer B is basically a glorified meter. But it should get you all 12 preamps."

audioengineering,3cofgp,Distraction182,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:47:11 2015 UTC,Pick up a Mudguard for acoustics and youre set.   So a Mudguard alone is pretty sufficient for a condenser microphone?  What about other mic isolation shields -- are they pretty much the same thing?  (Or is there something superior about the Mudguard?)
audioengineering,3cofgp,emcnelis,3,Thu Jul 9 15:35:18 2015 UTC,"Something like a mudguard is not going to isolate as much as it would cut down on the room reflections that would make it back into the mic. Which wouldn't be a bad thing by any means, but you would still hear, say, a car driving by if you can clearly hear it in your room.  Honestly for a podcast, I don't see any reason you have to have a condenser, especially if you are worried about outside noise. Using a dynamic mic will cut down on how much outside noise the mic picks up dramatically. The Shure sm7 and the electro voice re20 are both classic broadcast microphones that are dynamic and would do a good job for what you want."
audioengineering,3cofgp,polarity30,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:52:48 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I can't afford those mics... but I've also heard good things about the Audio-Technica ATR2100 -- I think it's around $60.
audioengineering,3cofgp,polarity30,2,Thu Jul 9 16:06:20 2015 UTC,"Audio-Technica ATR2100   Just saw this part. You are looking at pickup up a USB mic. I won't say that you can't get a good result from those, but I have yet to talk to anyone that has purchased a USB mic and been happy with the result. You might be better off to try and save a little more money and get a cheap interface and a better mic (you can always go with the Shure sm58 for the cheap version (tried and true, rarely ever breaks, used on pretty much every stage ever) or if you want to go more expensive the Shure SM7b has gotten great reviews."
audioengineering,3cofgp,SelectaRx,3,Thu Jul 9 17:05:40 2015 UTC,"Also forgot to add, you would be way better off sticking with a dynamic mic over trying to use any of the stuff you've posted with a condenser. If your environment isn't conducive to a condenser mic and you don't have the funds to get it where you need, go with the dynamic. Be real with yourself about what you're trying to accomplish, what you expect the end result to sound like, and what you can (or are willing) to spend. If you could get a radio quality sound from a $15 mic and a couple pieces of foam no one would spend millions to build studios and buy gear.  That being said, there is NOTHING wrong with the $15 setup and foam, just be realistic about what you want out of that setup. If you want something better, plan for it. It's better to buy a little more expensive once, then buy all this and turn around in 3 weeks and have to go the more expensive route anyway."
audioengineering,3cofgp,aberton,3,Thu Jul 9 17:11:35 2015 UTC,"Aside from building a smaller, soundproofed room within the room in which you're currently recording, the practical answer is ""none,"" and you have two other options:   Move your operation to a quieter room in your house.  Use a noise gate and a windscreen (allowing you to get closer to the mic, reducing the amount of ambient noise whilst speaking) and proper mic technique to achieve the best possible signal to noise ratio you can, and hope that your noise floor isn't so loud that it's audible along with your voice in your recordings.    TL;DR; Unless you're a genius carpenter/acoustician, either finding a quieter space, or gating and proper mic tehnique are your best solutions."
audioengineering,3cofgp,RockyValderas,2,Thu Jul 9 14:31:49 2015 UTC,"The exact solution depends on what types of sounds are keeping up the noise floor in your room. Problems like air ventilation systems and thin, poorly insulated walls are very difficult to deal with. If you are getting too much of a ""roomy"" sound (as opposed to a direct, in your face sound) then properly placed diffusers and absorbers around first reflection surfaces could help. If your microphone has different polar patterns, experiment with which ones sound best in your room. Omni picks you up wherever you are relative to the mic, but it will pick up everything else in the room. The more cardioid you go, the more focused and direction-specific the microphone will pick up sound, which is good for eliminating room tone BUT if you go too directional then every inch you move could have more drastically different input levels. There will even be a specific location and orientation in your room that allows for the highest signal to noise ratio.  Experiment! Try your absolute hardest not to push your mic gain up so much that you record the noise floor - THAT'S the game of recording in ""poorly treated"" rooms."
audioengineering,3cofgp,RockyValderas,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:22:35 2015 UTC,"I think you may be getting soundproofing and acoustic treatment mixed up.   Soundproofing and acoustic treatment are very different things. Most people outside the industry think that the acoustic paneling and foam and diffusers and those things that are visible are responsible for soundproofing. This is untrue. Those things provide acoustic treatment, which is a means of controlling the sound within the room.   Acoustic treatment is used to control reflections and room modes, which can cause certain frequencies to seem louder or softer in certain parts of the room.   Soundproofing takes place inside the walls, and requires an immense amount of construction, knowledge, and money. Generally, when soundproofing a room, you are building a floating room within that room. There is a gap of air and insulation on all six sides. This even means doubling up on doors to create an ""airlock"" type of space, and on windows.   So, to answer your question, if you are having issues with outside noise, then I would suggest simply using a dynamic mic. A lot less trouble and a lot less factors overall. Yo can even save up and get a really nice studio quality dynamic mic like the Shure SM7 like someone mentioned above. Fun fact: Michael Jackson recorded a lot of his vocals on the SM7.   If your heart is set on using a condenser, you can try some of the solutions others have offered, but there is no guarantee you will get the results you're after.   If the problem is inside noise, then a little portable vocal booth would probably be your best solution if using a condenser. Putting up acoustic treatment also requires quite a bit of knowledge and math, so bringing the acoustic treatment to the mic is the simplest solution.   Good luck!"

RAID isn't a backup, it's just a system more reliable than a single disk.  Backups are copies, more than one. You should have at least two copies at minimum, with one of them being located off-site in case something happens to the primary location.  SSD's and flash memory are unreliable for long term storage. If they're without power for long enough data loss and file corruption will occur.  The way you approach how to do your backup comes ultimately by your choice. You can do them manually by copy/pasting, or use tools to automate the process. You can even build a NAS system to do your primary backup."

Generally you use 2 or more disks from the same vendor and class, coming from the same batch and sometimes even with sequential serial numbers.

The difference is that in RAID, if you accidentally delete or change a particular file, that change is replicated among all your other drives. You won't be able to recover your lost file with RAID if you accidentally delete something.   The purpose of RAID is to mitigate downtime when you have a drive failure. One drive fails, you swap in a new drive, and it'll rebuild the array.   On the other hand, a backup takes regular snapshots of your data (daily, weekly, or whenever) so that if you need to recover something from a particular date, it's there. If a cryptowall or cryptolocker virus encrypts your drives, RAID can't help you there. You'll have to restore your files from a time before they got encrypted (which is what a backup will let you do).  TL;DR - RAID is redundancy; it mitigates downtime in the event of disk failure. Backups let you restore files from past dates in case current versions of files get deleted, corrupted, encrypted, or changed. You should have both."

You can have 2 raided drives that mirror each other. You can have 3 drives that all hold some information (striped), you can have striped and mirrored. The list goes on and on.

I know this because I heard all the voicemails. With places like Full Sail pumping out thousands of ""engineers"" all the time, all the while work is shrinking the more artists move to home studios, its nearly impossible for a green person to make a living as a studio engineer.   When I was still in studios I made most of my money as a Freelance AV tech. This was great because I could make my own schedule in case some big name artist came through the studio, while still being able to make money doing audio. I also did a lot of audio editing and a little composing for radio commercials, but AV pays and is more consistent if you can handle how dumb clients can be sometimes.   I'd look into that and brush up on some live sound. It's great to diversify your skills if you want to make a living as an audio engineer.   I will say, networking is the single most important tool you can cultivate. I was able to fill in on tour with a big name artist because I left somewhere on good terms.

For instance, if I have a very sterile, characterless comp on a vocal track set to a specific threshold, could I duplicate this effect exactly by bypassing the comp and automating every transient that exceeds my threshold with fader rides that mimic that attack/release of the comp? Sorry if this is confusing; I'm mainly curious if, beyond idiosyncracies of different compressor models, if all that's being done is intelligent automation, or if there's more at play."
audioengineering,3cjoj3,tonypizzicato,5,Wed Jul 8 15:45:19 2015 UTC,Consider the sonic characteristics that are created by harmonic distortion. You can't really do that with automation.
audioengineering,3cjoj3,G00N4R,2,Wed Jul 8 16:40:27 2015 UTC,"Right; that's what I was trying to get across by saying ""sterile, colorless"", to take the idiosyncrasies of different compressor models out of the equation. I figured those unique distortions are in fact imperfections caused more by circuitry in various hardware comps than through compression itself by definition."
audioengineering,3cjoj3,MP5Squeaky,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:10:06 2015 UTC,"That is slightly incorrect. Without attack and release timing, a compressor would simply be a clipper. Release timing in particular, serves to smooth the sidechain control voltage in order to reduce that distortion, but it's never perfect."
audioengineering,3cjoj3,PepeAndMrDuck,2,Wed Jul 8 22:27:02 2015 UTC,What I'm still not sure about is how the distortion/harmonics arise from compression. If all we're doing with a compressor is automating volume dynamics and then changing the overall gain afterwards then how are people using it to change the sound of kicks etc. by adding distortion or harmonics? Because I've used a seemingly sterile compressor such as Live's to add or remove low end from a kick for example. Or add high end harmonics or distortion to something else. And I'm just not sure how this is happening.
audioengineering,3cjoj3,BurningCircus,2,Wed Jul 8 20:25:56 2015 UTC,"A lot of it is down to perception. If you take a kick drum and compress it hard with a slow attack, the initial transient gets through before the middle of the hit is squashed. Due to the makeup gain, the tail also rings longer (this is called ""sustain""). The greater volume difference between the initial transient and the middle if the hit, coupled with the increased sustain gives the impression that the drum was hit harder, and therefore it sounds subjectively more powerful. Do this to a whole drum kit and the resonance rings out, filling space and giving a ""thicker"" sound while adding sharp, punchy transients to the beginning of each shell.  These are just examples; I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about when you add or remove the low end from a kick."
audioengineering,3cjoj3,PepeAndMrDuck,2,Wed Jul 8 23:49:52 2015 UTC,"This makes a lot of sense, thanks."
audioengineering,3cjoj3,Staidly,2,Thu Jul 9 00:23:55 2015 UTC,"Kinks, bends, or sharp edges in waveforms represent high order harmonics. The more you squish and deform a waveform, the sharper your edges, the more high frequency harmonics are created. Square waves have tons of harmonics because of those sharp edges, for example. Hard knees in compressors = more higher order harmonics, soft knee means less."
audioengineering,3cjoj3,CallmeAdmiral,6,Thu Jul 9 08:05:56 2015 UTC,"Sure! I'll give you an example as a dialog editor for games. The workflow is a little different but it will give you an idea. Sometimes (depending on the material) I'll have my dialogue on track A and routed to an Aux track with my processing effects (eq, comp etc). So what happens is that I ride the fader on track A and make the dialog (your vocal track) as smooth and balanced as I can and since the compressor is gonna kick in on the Aux track (post track A fader) it will catch the peaks that were too high on track A, in case something wasnt balanced enough with the fader. With this you also accomplish not hitting the compressor too hard in the quieter/smoother passages but then it helps bringing down the higher ones in addition to what you already did automating levels (track A). Hope that made sense. So yes, you can duplicate the effect but it is very time consuming if you wanna go surgical automating. Experiment a little and eventually you'll decide if you want to use one or the other or a combination of both like I described"
audioengineering,3cjoj3,Clobstudios,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:09:22 2015 UTC,"I believe automation, depending on your DAW is much most destructive and harder to manipulated depending on your control surface and the like. Someone mentioned using automation to do the main rounding and then compress it, I agree with this technique especially for spoken dialogue. And to answer your second question, I don't believe that it's a form of automatic automation(maybe some are?) but it is mimicking an analog compressor which doesn't really have anything to do with automation.

audioengineering,3cjoj3,stolenbaby,3,Wed Jul 8 16:42:01 2015 UTC,"I think a graphical explanation is best:http://www.ians-net.co.uk/articles/balanced_lines.php  To ELI5, a balanced line plays a little trick to wipe away noise from the signal- it sends the original signal, and the opposite signal at the same time through the wire.  If noise effects the signal, like if you have a big magnet or microwave or something, then the noise effects both signals in the same way.  When the signals arrive, you invert one of them back to normal and combine.  When you do this, you end up combining the noise and it's inverse, which gets rid of it, so that you cancel out the noise."

audioengineering,3cjoj3,MP5Squeaky,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:59:04 2015 UTC,"Not entirely. Instrumentation and mix dynamics can create differing loudness outcomes under limiting. What may sound loud on your reference material is not necessarily what you should aim to replicate, and can be detrimental to the master in some cases. In other cases, you may be able to push it louder. I'd say your ears are a better judge of loudness than any meter."
audioengineering,3cjoj3,dkinmn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:28:58 2015 UTC,"I'll buy that for sure, particularly since there's no guarantee that my EQ profile is the same as what is pushing the other limiter.   Still, it was shocking. And it did explain a reason as to why my stuff mastered to -12 was coming in quiet compared to my reference.   I just always heard that as being a good target, but this record was universally hotter than that, and don't seem to be too loud or dynamically uninteresting."
audioengineering,3cjoj3,MP5Squeaky,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:46:06 2015 UTC,"I can almost guarantee that clever use of EQ, saturation and compression before hitting the limiter is behind that louder-but-still-dynamic sound. Multiband compression in particular is incredibly effective at pushing up loudness (especially in the low end) while retaining a lot of perceived dynamic movement."

audioengineering,3cjoj3,BurningCircus,2,Wed Jul 8 21:06:46 2015 UTC,Logic track -> Apollo Twin output -> Avalon M5 -> Apollo Twin input -> different Logic track.  That's if you're using it as a piece of outboard gear to run already-recorded tracks through. If you're tracking through it it'll look like:  Source -> Avalon M5 -> Apollo Twin input -> Logic track.

audioengineering,3cjoj3,BurningCircus,3,Thu Jul 9 02:55:46 2015 UTC,"You can, but you might get more ""character"" than you were looking for. Mic input impedance is about 1.5k, while a line level signal wants to see 10k. You might experience some significant high end loss due to this. I would recommend at least trying sending your line out into the instrument level/hi-Z input, because it'll bridge the impedance properly (although you'll still have to send it a low level). The disadvantage of this is that (1.) some hi-Z inputs bypass input transformers, which means you don't get as much character, and (2.) you won't require as much gain from the preamp (high gain is where you get character to come through), so it'll just be more transparent in general.   Come to think, if you have a spare DI box lying around, that would be the best option. Run the line out into the input of the DI and the mic level out from the DI into the preamp. That way the preamp sees what it wants to and you can proceed to crank the gain up to normal mic levels without problems, giving you the closest possible thing to how the preamp would have performed on the original source."

audioengineering,3cjoj3,tylrg,2,Thu Jul 9 09:48:19 2015 UTC,Three questions:  What is automation?  What is side-chaining?  What is an envelope?
audioengineering,3cjoj3,iFluxxx,3,Thu Jul 9 01:40:47 2015 UTC,"Surprised nobody has answered this yet since it's a really basic set of questions. Automation and Envelopes are similar. They are a way to change a parameter over time. Usually you will see an envelope in the form of an amp envelope, or ADSR. Pretty much every synth has an amp envelope. Envelopes are used if you want to change something generic about the sound, like an attack or release time. Automation is used if you want to do something crazy and unique, or at least more complex than attack and release.  Sidechaining doesn't really have to do with those but kinda. Every production term kinda goes with each other if you think about it. Sidechaining is usually used as a way to mix two low-frequency instruments, such as kick and bass. You can side chain a bass sound to a kick sound, and the bass sound will lower in volume whenever the kick sound is being played. I made you an example The first is without the sidechain and then it's applied in the second. The kick is able to be heard a lot better in the second instance because the kick and the bass are playing at seperate times. I hope I helped you and feel free to ask any questions."
audioengineering,3cjoj3,BurningCircus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:32:45 2015 UTC,"I want to add some more details to the answers already offered to you.   Automation is usually entered manually and is basically a set of instructions for the computer to replay every time it runs into them. You might see it being used in a DAW environment to write out fader moves (to change the balance in a song at a certain point), which the computer will then play back. It can also be used to ""automate"" effects parameters, such as altering the amount of feedback in a delay effect in real time, or automating pan to make tracks zoom around the stereo spectrum on playback.  Envelopes are a set of characteristics (usually attack, decay, sustain, and release, usually referred to as ADSR) that are applied to any sound going through them. Most commonly seen with synths (where it controls the dynamic shaping of the notes being played), but vocoders and ""auto-wah"" envelope filters use the same concepts to produce different results by applying the filter in a different way.  Side-chaining is a whole different beast. It is a term used when talking about compression. Every compressor has a detection circuit that reads the RMS (usually) of the incoming signal and tells the compressor how to react to the audio (i.e. when and how hard to compress). In some compressors, you have the option of feeding this detection circuit with different audio than what is actually being compressed. This is called side-chaining. In the most prevalent example in modern music production, a compressor is set up on the bass, but its detection circuit (side-chain) is being fed from the kick drum track. What ends up happening is that whenever the kick drum hits, the detection circuit tells the compressor to compress the bass. You end up with a bass track that gets quieter automatically every time the kick drum hits, which can be very useful, especially for EDM."

audioengineering,3cjoj3,BurningCircus,2,Wed Jul 8 20:28:48 2015 UTC,"I've pulled off the Haas effect in this situation with decent results. I generally like 25-35ms of delay. I've found that sub-10ms delays just give you comb filtering and blurring with no separation. Also, try taking one side (one mic) and either reamping it or running an amp sim plugin on it pretty heavily. Sometimes that can create enough difference in the two mics to give you a good amount of separation."

You may be able to make some cool creative decisions based on your predicament.  2) Try copying the guitar to a second track and offsetting it.  It will most likely still not sound great, but it will be wider.  Try using a plug-in like Waves' Center to pull out some of the frequencies both tracks share from the phantom center.  3) Are you proficient at guitar?  Could you just get close enough to the tone and record the part again by yourself at your own expense?"
audioengineering,3cjoj3,Barncore,2,Wed Jul 8 20:18:41 2015 UTC,"1) It's a basic punk rock setup. Mono bass in the middle, drums with each individual drum miced, + overheads + room mic. Vocals in the middle. Everything is sort of in the middle already, i think it makes sense to get the guitars out to the side. Also the singer sent me a reference song and the guitars were very wide.  2) Center doesn't work on mono tracks, only stereo.    3) I am proficient at guitar, but there are 20 songs (recorded in the same session, same mics), so it's not a realistic option for me to play it in."

Depending on the mics you used you should check their specs and find their deficient frequencies and make it up.   Setting the tracks to a small delay or reverb would widen them also.  One other trick would maybe be to just re-amp the guitars all together. Try to find an amp with a better tone and play the track through it and record it, if it doesn't muttle it up too much that is."

I'm not an expert on drum triggers, but no one's answered you yet, so I'll take a crack at it.  First, exactly what drum triggers are you using? Some ""triggers"" are just contact mics designed to minimize bleed that still output audio. If your triggers output MIDI, you're in business. Otherwise you'll have to find some kind of plugin that generates MIDI data from transients. ReaGate can do this in Reaper, and Logic has this functionality built in, but I don't know about Sonar.   Once you've got MIDI data flowing, you can choose what drum machine you want to use for triggering your samples, be it a plugin or a hardware module. In fact, you might find it more difficult to get playback working optimally on a module, because it will require patching MIDI over to it (via 5-pin or USB). Note that you will have to adjust your MIDI data so that it plays the correct notes. The way most drum machines work is by assigning keyboard notes to certain drums (I think C2 is usually kick, etc.), so if everything is playing the same ""note,"" it'll just sound like one very energetic drum."
