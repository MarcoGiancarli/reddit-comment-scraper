Grizzly is one of the highest. Dark is not as acidic as regular WG in my opinion so regular will hit you harder since it is more acidic. More acidic=more nicotine absorbed faster. Then again, if you've been dipping regular and switch to dark, you might feel it more since it's a new dip. That happens sometimes."

I would keep the tins your not dipping in a small box in the fridge if I were you, or a cigar humidor. TLDR: Forgot tin of cracked cope LC in my truck for a week, was still g2g."

Best bet is to hit up a reservation or make a trip to the states and stock up. Although I distinctly remember one Canadian saying he got a tub of Stoker's and it came out to like $100-$150 total after taxes, which is still significantly less than what you pay. I'm sure some other Canadians can provide more insight."

DippingTobacco,3e3qso,AyBeeSees,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:18:25 2015 UTC,"I dip about a can a week of just it. (Usually I'll buy a can of it after a hard day and I'll dip it that night and the next day) so I can't tell you exactly. But WG of any kind will. And assuming Kodiak is worse because of the high PH (how it gets a high free nicotine content) but over the last few months I've dipping grizz dark WG and have noticed a lot. It's gotten to the point where I'm staying away from it. My best advice - either take two little pinches on each side of your lip. Or pack it near your molars gums are thicker/tougher back there. If your that worried, switch between a natural/straight to Kodiak. It's hard to give up the bear ik. It's so delicious and good. My favorite lol. Currently packing a full horshoe of it. Lol"

I can't see how the tiny warning on cigarettes can be justified since they are far more dangerous than dip is. I think it comes down to the cigarette companies being cozied up to the government more than the dip companies.

DippingTobacco,3dyhlo,Copenhagenkindaguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:11:56 2015 UTC,I was a beginner. Would have puked like a bitch. it was cope green. Haha
DippingTobacco,3dyhlo,dwighty97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:47:33 2015 UTC,Depending on the flavor I'm pretty good at gutting it lol. Straight is so easy to gut for me. Natural... That's a different story

Today I was in a 6 hour class at the company's training center to get recertified on deadly H2S gas that you can incounter out at Well sites and 10 out of the 12 guys in the class including myself , all had a dip in almost the entire class. Even my instructor was dipping lol."

DippingTobacco,3dznwn,Maytown,3,Mon Jul 20 20:50:07 2015 UTC,"Best wintergreen available, 100% American goodness right there, not so great, but tolerable, fruity shit."
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,Diplipper,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:13 2015 UTC,Kodiak is my favorite wintergreen. It's expensive but it's the best and also has the highest nicotine.
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,Heideliciousness,3,Tue Jul 21 17:09:58 2015 UTC,"Snuff, the Grand daddy of them all. Kodiak, a higher quality Grizzly. Berry.....get the fuck outta here"
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,postrent,3,Mon Jul 20 21:05:47 2015 UTC,In my opinion Snuff is the best dip period. Never had Skoal berry because I don't have a vagina and I don't drive a baby blue prius. And let me know how that Kodiak wintergreen tastes. I love wintergreens but Kodiak isn't around where I am. I heard It's great. I'd recommend (if you haven't had it before) Skoal original fine cut and Grizzly dark wintergreen if you like wintergreens those both are good ones. I'm a Copenhagen wintergreen guy but I like these ones too.
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,AZ_SnuffMan,2,Mon Jul 20 23:28:29 2015 UTC,"Never had Skoal berry because I don't have a vagina and I don't drive a baby blue prius.   How very secure you must feel /s  If you like wintergreen I'd highly recommend  the Kodiak.  It has a great taste and the highest free nicotine content of any dip I know of.  I did try Grizzly Dark w/g when it came out around here.  I thought it was nice but I think right now for wintergreens Kodiak would be my #1, Copenhagen #2, grizzly #3, grizzly dark #4, skoal Xtra #5, skoal #6, and longhorn in dead last.  Any tips for getting a good pinch of cope snuff?  I am liking it a lot but  I've been spilling it all over the place.  I'm thinking of trying what you're supposed to do with snus and just putting a shit load in my hand and trying to compress that into a brick-like density."
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,I_like_platapussy,2,Tue Jul 21 03:04:50 2015 UTC,"Kodiak good, berry ok, cope gets caught in teeth"
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,HeroicActions,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:57:12 2015 UTC,All dip gets caught in my teeth regardless of cut.  I usually  brush really quickly afterwards unless I'm immediately putting new pinches in after I throw old ones out.
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,dwighty97,2,Mon Jul 20 21:09:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting choices, Kodiak is my EDD, snuff is pretty good and I don't dip skoal. I thinks it's funny how you have the two manliest dips and then skoal berry."
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,dwighty97,4,Mon Jul 20 21:12:03 2015 UTC,"I have, what I like to call, diverse tastes."
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,dwighty97,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:14:27 2015 UTC,"Hey now, Skoal straight is pretty good. Everything else is awful."
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,release_the_ccracken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:26:58 2015 UTC,"I dunno I think apple, spearmint, and xrta mint are pretty good.  A bit weak but good."
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,goshordr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:32:53 2015 UTC,"Not much of a mint guy so I've never tried them tbh. Apple is yucky to me. Doesnt come close to apples IMO (of course my cans may be old, everybody dips cope snuff or grizzly wintergreen here)"
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,release_the_ccracken,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:21:54 2015 UTC,If you get a fresh can of apple it tastes just like a granny smith.  Otherwise it's not so good.  Give the two mint ones I mentioned a try if you ever feel like it.  Normally they're a little too sugary for me but I went through a phase where I really liked them.
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,goshordr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:57:36 2015 UTC,Is it more sweet and less burny? I always feel like I'm chewing/tasting dentine ice. I'd love a sweet mint
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,Joohjo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:26:53 2015 UTC,They're not as burny  as like Copenhagen wintergreen or anything like that but still are a little bit.  They're both very sweet tasting however.
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,Joohjo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:34 2015 UTC,So I'm continuing my great flavor adventure by buying 3 more types of dip I haven't tried yet.  Thoughts so far:  *Copenhagen Snuff - I am really happy with this.  It is probably my new favorite tobacco that isn't flavored.  I like it much more than straight or natural.  Taking a good sized pinch is still a little tricky but I'm getting the hang of it.  *Skoal Berry - This may be the worst one yet.  Maybe even worse than Skoal Cherry (which actually kind of grew on me eve though it is awful).  Something about it just seems off.  *Kodiak WG - This may be my new favorite dip period.  It has a really strong flavor and it burns like hell which is good.  It also gives me a buzz which doesn't normally happen from the sized pinches that I typically use.  Any other suggestions for shit to try?  I did another thread where I talked about what I'd tried already.  I'll add the new stuff I've tried since then to that and link it here if anyone cares about not recommending  stuff I've done already.  Edit: fuck  you autocorrect I'll swear if I want.
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,dwighty97,2,Mon Jul 20 20:58:46 2015 UTC,Try Skoal Classic if you can find it. Probably one of my all time favorite dips but it's very hard to find.
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,postrent,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:20:31 2015 UTC,"Agree with this. My favorite natural by far. Not hard to find at all around me though, most gas stations in my area of PA carry it. I actually just got a tin of it earlier today because I'm running low on Stoker's and wanted a quick switch."
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,dwighty97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:33:05 2015 UTC,"You lucky bastard haha. I don't think I've ever seen it in a gas station here in Alabama, and I only know of one tobacco outlet that keeps it in stock."
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,Joohjo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:15 2015 UTC,"The thing with Skoal Classic around here is, though, that nobody ever buys it. The expiration date on every can of Classic I've gotten is normally 2 weeks to less than a week til the expiration date. I normally put a few drops of water in it to moisten it up. Even with usually doing that, I'd still say it's better than Copenhagen natural."
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,Joohjo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:26:47 2015 UTC,I'll chime in with red wood natural...not very common but not a bad dip imo. if you can find it try it
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,littlebro779,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:40:19 2015 UTC,I don't think I've ever heard of that brand.  I'll be sure to look around for it.
DippingTobacco,3dznwn,Bullet76,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:23:14 2015 UTC,It's not common at all. My dad use to dip so when I was old enough I bought myself a can and tried...kinda what go me started tbh

DippingTobacco,3e0fm7,Peecs36,2,Tue Jul 21 01:06:11 2015 UTC,"If cold turkey doesnt work for you try substituting with camel snus only when you absolutely need it. Thats shat worked for 3 of my fraternity brothers during college. Put it somewhere besides where you normally dip, they said it helps break the association of that feeling in your lip and nicotine. Then slowly but consistently drop the amount of times you let yourself put in some snus.   For them it helped with the wanting to go back beause of the headaches. Also if you can, get an accountability buddy. A good buddy you can trust that you agree to tell him every time you dip or use snus. Have him regularly ask you too, because omission is way easier than directly lying. Having to tell someone you caved is a huge motivator not to, trust me."
