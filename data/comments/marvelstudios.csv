marvelstudios,3e2gwv,OtakuMecha,4,Tue Jul 21 16:09:30 2015 UTC,How about AoU?  Or minions that they passed?  Like was GotG as amazing there as it was here?  Is 10 less than the US normal?
marvelstudios,3e2gwv,ERagingTyrant,7,Tue Jul 21 16:13:10 2015 UTC,It's definitely less than the US normal but that's cause UK's population/box office isn't as big as the United States. Minions opened at like 18 million there but over 100 million in the states IIRC. AoU opened at 27 million there and the original Avengers opened at 25 million.

That actually sounds like very rich source material. I think the word he was looking for was ""pleasant."""

It's not all of them, and sure, some of them genuinely believe their doom and gloom predictions, but that's largely what it is. Just go back and look at pre-release press for pretty much anything in Phase 2, especially Gaurdians and Ant-Man. It's the same thing over and over again - fatigue, weird lesser-known characters that can't carry a film, studio politics, etc. And they've been proven wrong again and again.

marvelstudios,3e2r55,dr00b,13,Tue Jul 21 14:44:11 2015 UTC,"Was he any more specific than just saying there's an easter egg no one's found? Because I feel like there's a lot of smaller ones no one really ever brings up but a few people have noticed, could be one of those. For example Drax's daughter is named Kamaria (or something like that) rather than Heather, leading me to believe rather than being Moondragon's father he might end up being Cammi's father instead (and GotG2 deals with fatherhood so we might find out there*) . Another not often mentioned one is Rocket building the bomb out of scrap which can ""blow up moons"", which I view as a reference to pre-DnA Starlord's (which is more of the version of Starlord we see now, he's certainly not the badass strategist dedicated to protecting the fabric of the universe we see in DnA after he ""retires"" for a significant period after this event up until Annihilation) destruction of a Kree moon with a mining colony of thousands in order to save the planet of billions nearby. More obvious but still not well known, Denarian (Garthan) Saal is a Nova in the comics who received the full Nova Force after the original destruction of Xandar without the Worldmind to regulate it who went crazy from the power; Richard Rider later does the same thing with the second destruction of Xandar in Annihilation which is a big part of him being such an awesome badass, and he also shelters the Worldmind which helps keep his mind stable despite the awesome power. Also, as more people know, Corpsman/Denarian Dey is the Nova who survives the original destruction of Xandar and then recruits Richard Rider (edit: this one obviously isn't the Easter egg but my point is the Nova they used are from the comics so there might be a really unknown one they used). I'm sure there's more even less obvious easter eggs spread throughout the movie which most people wouldn't recognize but have been pointed out rarely, it's highly likely Gunn was referring to one of these.  *on that note, not too relevant, but what if fatherhood is the connecting theme of Phase 3? Ant-Man, while not technically Phase 3 but which originally was referred to as such, obviously has heavy stuff about fatherhood, then there's GotG2 we know has some of that stuff, Civil War could deal with Bucky's role in Howard Stark's death, Black Panther could have a somewhat major role for T'Chaka, Thor 3 could deal with Loki replacing Odin and maybe have dead Odin, obviously Spider-Man's origins involve losing his father figure, leaving Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel, Avengers 3 and Inhumans without obvious ways of dealing with that theme."
marvelstudios,3e2r55,kaimason1,8,Tue Jul 21 15:37:22 2015 UTC,You know another movie that has a huge fatherhood theme?  Return of the Jedi
marvelstudios,3e2r55,DunspArceus4,3,Tue Jul 21 17:47:05 2015 UTC,"OH SHIT. That's all the proof I need after how Phase 2 has panned out. We've worked out Phase 3 already team, we're done here."

marvelstudios,3e33m4,longcoldstare,14,Tue Jul 21 16:41:23 2015 UTC,This is likely the most correct answer. I don't think Steve was ever given pilot lessons or training since his role was that of the bomb that drops from the plane.
marvelstudios,3e33m4,SMB73,7,Tue Jul 21 16:47:35 2015 UTC,what about that time he flew an experimental bomb with propellers and wings into the hangar of a moving plane a few minutes earlier?

Maybe he was also considering Hydra being able to get to the plane first and recovering those, so he made sure to crash it where no one would get to them. Or heck, maybe he was thinking that no one should have them, and didn't want the Allies studying them either."
marvelstudios,3e33m4,themosquito,6,Tue Jul 21 16:37:14 2015 UTC,Why didn't he try to land it on the ice instead of intentionally crashing?  It might not have worked but he would have a better chance of survival than nose diving an iceberg
marvelstudios,3e33m4,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,5,Tue Jul 21 16:23:35 2015 UTC,"Trying to land that thing on an iceberg basically would've been a crash, anyway. Steve Rogers was not a pilot, and that iceberg was not a runway."

marvelstudios,3e33m4,Friendly_B,4,Tue Jul 21 19:59:33 2015 UTC,"I don't buy it. The (former) US Air Force base in Stephenville, Newfoundland is a massive slab of concrete, and in 1945 it was a military town relatively far from any densely populated area (about 82 km to Corner Brook, about 25000 people at the time).  And that's if he wanted to go to an American base. The (closer) air base in Goose Bay was joint Canadian-British at the time and there's nobody around for hundreds of kilometres. While these bases were much more important in WWII, there were other bases in Northwest Territories as well that could've been used. Fact is, there was no excuse to put it in the water. It was just a necessary plot hole.  (Fun trivia: despite being host to American, Canadian, and British air bases during WWII, Newfoundland & Labrador was an independent nation at the time.)"
marvelstudios,3e33m4,mb862,2,Tue Jul 21 16:49:32 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is this: I've checked, and the runways at both airports would be way too short. The landing distance of the Antonov An-225, the largest jet aircraft in the world, at Maximum Landing Weight (MLW) is 11,482 ft (3,499.7m). The longest runway currently at Stephenville (I'm not sure how long the runways they had during the war were) is 10,011ft (3,051m) long, and the longest runway at Goose Bay (same disclaimer as above) is 11,051ft (3,368m) long, both less than the landing run of the An-225, and so most definitely too short for the Valkyrie, and I really don't think they'd want to run the risk of using a too-short runway.  To give you a sense of the difference in size, here is a picture of the An-225 with a car for comparison to the landing gear, and here is a picture of the Valkyrie main gear with humans for scale.

marvelstudios,3e33m4,mb862,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:01 2015 UTC,"Dude does his research, upvotes to you. Great points. While both remain active as civilian airports, neither, especially Stephenville, have really changed in that time, so the runways would've been about the same length then. Both bases served as waypoints between North America and Europe, so were designed to handle the larger aircraft that would've made the transoceanic journey.  Though I would argue that being a few hundred metres short is still more ideal. Both runways end in water, so even if the craft couldn't come to a complete stop, it would've been a much safer water landing compared to what he did in the Arctic."

Thanos could come at anytime after that happens, and he would win, because everyone would be so out of it.

But what really caught my attention was her comment about being shot if she gave out plot details. So many people who work with Marvel have said this that I have to think there's a scripted talk they all get about it. Remember how many actors have joked about the ""red dot on their foreheads"" as an excuse not to give details during interviews? No way it's a coincidence.  So, now I'm 80-90% sure there's someone working at Marvel whose job it is to ""threaten"" all of the actors with grievous bodily harm.  Edit: showing some proof of what I'm talking about in regards to the ""being shot"" comments:  Michael Douglas, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Chris Evans, and Don Cheadle at the beginning of this Conan clip all mention the ""red dot"" in different interviews.

marvelstudios,3e0wu4,Silverparachute,10,Tue Jul 21 03:49:46 2015 UTC,Makes me wonder how much he's gonna get in terms of screentime
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,JNPR1996,12,Tue Jul 21 03:52:08 2015 UTC,"Probably very little given the hugeness of the cast, but any at all will be enough for me. The fact that a character like that can exist in a blockbuster today is amazing."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,Silverparachute,11,Tue Jul 21 03:54:53 2015 UTC,He'll probably have a little more or less than his total screen time in AoU. Expect IW 1 and 2 to be his films.
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,JNPR1996,5,Tue Jul 21 04:00:54 2015 UTC,I imagine he will be in the initial conflict the Avengers are a part of that sets off the Registration Act. Then there will be a scene of Stark and Rogers trying to get him to side with them. Maybe a scene or two of the government attempting to figure him out.  I'm not expecting a lot from Vision. But hopefully I'm wrong.
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,that_guy2010,6,Tue Jul 21 07:01:19 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much what Doctor Strange does in the comics, for similar reasons.  He says something along the lines of ""I could decide this myself, but I shouldn't."""
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,rodmandiplomacy,4,Tue Jul 21 10:20:13 2015 UTC,"exactly, w/o Thor nor Hulk he´s by far the most powerful Avenger left, he probably could beat the rest of them together if he wanted too"
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,soulbreaker1418,4,Tue Jul 21 05:35:42 2015 UTC,"That somewhat depends on how far they take Scarlet Witch's power.  She was pretty muted for most of AoU, but she did rip apart vibranium at the end...  That said, it seems unlikely that they would end up on opposite sides."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,rodmandiplomacy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:23:05 2015 UTC,"no way she is even near the power she has on comics, maybe she can mind control people while applying a spell but that´s it"

marvelstudios,3e0wu4,Vinnie_Vegas,2,Tue Jul 21 07:56:50 2015 UTC,Could he phase into hulk and actually kill him?
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,SirHoneyDip,2,Tue Jul 21 13:35:28 2015 UTC,"Sounds plausible.  Probably one of the very, very few that can take out Hulk!"
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,palewest,2,Tue Jul 21 15:46:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe a bit like Dr. Manhatten in Watchmen. He kinda ""lost"" too, despite being the only OP hero in the universe."

marvelstudios,3e0wu4,Helicuor,2,Tue Jul 21 07:07:39 2015 UTC,"One has to be the Hulk. Not sure about the other.  Edit: Maybe the second is Scarlet Witch, once she learns more about her own powers?"
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,Silverparachute,4,Tue Jul 21 08:59:24 2015 UTC,"He probably meant Hulk and Thor.  Although Thanos, if you include him, is probably going to end up stronger than either (strictly talking about the MCU here, and what they will need to do for plot).  Scarlet Witch could as well, depending on how far they want to take her power."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,rodmandiplomacy,2,Tue Jul 21 10:24:59 2015 UTC,Thor is probably the other. But scarlet witch is definitely a force

marvelstudios,3e0wu4,rodmandiplomacy,12,Tue Jul 21 10:18:58 2015 UTC,I thought you meant the Vision was going around threatening Marvel actors with contracts and lawyers oops.
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,poondi,6,Tue Jul 21 07:37:30 2015 UTC,This is also correct.
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,The_AtomBomb,4,Tue Jul 21 07:52:14 2015 UTC,"I was thinking this could have something to do with Tony's clone of Thor named Ragnarok, but now that you bring Vision up, his MCU version seems to really mirror Ragnarok more than I initially realized (in that he's a robot with influence from Thor and who's creation was hugely due to Stark's actions), and putting him in a similar role (maybe Tony reprograms him to try to get Vision on his side which leads to Vision killing someone and then leaving Earth by the end, and a reprogrammed Vision would piss Thor off so we could get a recreation of the Tony-Thor reunion comic scene either in Ragnarok or more likely in Infinity War) would work in the MCU much better, so I hope this is what happens. And then Vision being off planet (I'm sure his personality would get reset somehow, either before he leaves Earth or after he encounters Thor) could set him up to be the Adam Warlock replacement he seems to be come Infinity War too. I like how this fits together."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,kaimason1,9,Tue Jul 21 06:14:07 2015 UTC,"Personal opinion: I hope Ragnarok (the character) never shows up.  He was always a bit silly, and basically a plot device to let Tony/Reed cause something really bad to happen without actually executing somebody directly.  The script writers can do better."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,rodmandiplomacy,4,Tue Jul 21 10:13:27 2015 UTC,clone of Thor named Ragnarok   Everyone around here (myself included) always jumps to the concept of Ragnarok the event. It'd be pretty crazy if it instead focused on the clone.
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,adse_,9,Tue Jul 21 06:57:32 2015 UTC,Feige already basically confirmed that the event is about the event not the clone.

marvelstudios,3e0wu4,adse_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:16:12 2015 UTC,The Clone would be a pointless tale to tell sinice it was Tony that already created a robot that went rouge (Ultron) so it would be rehashed and boring.

marvelstudios,3e0wu4,Try_Another_Please,2,Tue Jul 21 07:05:23 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I still totally think the movie would focus on the event and not the clone, we already know as much and I always figured the clone would be too over the top for Cap 3 anyways especially if they're going to make Tony seem like less of a villain. But the clone is the main thing I can think of which might link Civil War and Thor 3, and doing him through Vision seems like it could work really well compared to directly adapting that aspect of Civil War."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,kaimason1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:12:30 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing, there's a casting call for Adama Warlock/Magus, so he's not taking his place."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,JNPR1996,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:21 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell that's purely rumor, the site every other site is quoting for its source doesn't even seem to exist anymore and I've never heard of it before so I'm certainly not going to treat it as a reliable fact. If Variety or Deadline or another similar source I can actually trust confirms it then I'll believe it but I'd think if a random tiny site heard of a casting call specifically for Magus (I think usually they aren't so blunt about what they're casting for) then it wouldn't be the only source spilling that news. Also all the sites talking about this rumor say the casting is for Infinity War, I'd believe casting for GotG2 going on now but I really doubt the IW script is anywhere near complete enough to be casting yet. There's also plot details in the rumor which seem incredibly unlikely to have been included in a casting call, especially with the whole IW script is nowhere near being that complete yet (especially considering that the Russos are still working on Civil War). The rumor seems like plain bullshit to me.  Also the characterization and changes made to MCU Vision seem manufactured with the express purpose of making him more of an Adam Warlock like figure, such as the idea of being an artificial ""perfect"" human, wearing an Infinity Gem in his forehead, being dedicated to protecting life, and being a savior archetype. If they went with this Vision as a Ragnarok analogue plot line it would even give him a Magus side of sorts."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,kaimason1,8,Tue Jul 21 17:39:21 2015 UTC,"I've worked on two Marvel films, security is insanely high on them"
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,StuFX,2,Tue Jul 21 13:56:45 2015 UTC,"Do you mind me asking what sorts of things they require people to do? The only thing I can think of is signing a strict NDA, but is there more?"
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,Silverparachute,6,Tue Jul 21 15:44:51 2015 UTC,"Well, its Disney running the show but they're a lot stricter with the security on the Marvel films than they are with other IP that I've worked on for them. With Disney a lot of file handling is done physically - so when shots and scenes are delivered it'll be via a physical hard drive handover to a member of their team, either coming to the vendors studio or vice versa. Never over an FTP or server. With Marvel as well, when they were working within our studio environments they'd install their own temporary separate internet connections and networks that are heavily secured. They run a tight ship, and are actually really professional and lovely to work with! :)"
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,StuFX,4,Tue Jul 21 16:12:22 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's really interesting (and good, because it sounds like there is very little chance of a leak with that kind of security). With regards to their use of physical disks to hand off shots, it sounds like how many hospitals handle patients' scan results. Thanks for the reply!  Do you mind if I ask you one more thing--did the Sony hack and leak last year lead to Disney reevaluating anything they were doing, or was their security already tight enough that it didn't lead to any changes being made?"
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,Silverparachute,5,Tue Jul 21 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"No problem, film industry is an interesting place. To answer your question about the Sony leak, I really have no idea. Noooo clue. We worked on Guardians of the Galaxy which was prior to the leak being publicized and their security was the same as it is now. After all, it wasn't them who were hacked ;)"
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,StuFX,3,Tue Jul 21 16:27:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, got it. It's just the sort of thing I would think would make people at various studios nervous.  On another note, working on Guardians makes you some sort of hero (tagging you as ""responsible for GotG"")!"

marvelstudios,3e0wu4,rodmandiplomacy,2,Tue Jul 21 10:10:50 2015 UTC,I definitely agree that it's about an NDA. It's the similar wording they use to discuss it that I find funny. I just edited my original comment with some links so you can see what I am talking about.
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,Silverparachute,3,Tue Jul 21 15:42:10 2015 UTC,Deadpool. Fourth wall.

marvelstudios,3e0wu4,BaltimoreProud,3,Tue Jul 21 12:58:08 2015 UTC,"I'm positive that Marvel has some PR people help coach any one about interviews.  Helping not slip the NDA on accident is in their best interest.  Some of that will absolutely include some scripted responses.  Things that are funny, obviously flippant, but convey that they are serious about not telling.  The assassination thing clearly fits the bill."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,ERagingTyrant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:42:05 2015 UTC,"That's a good point I hadn't thought of--they might have be told to say it. I just assumed they were all picking it up from a talk they were given individually, but I think your explanation is more likely."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,Silverparachute,3,Tue Jul 21 15:51:35 2015 UTC,"I actually bothered to check those interviews, and I just want to point out that the ""red dot"" Douglas is referring to is a tracking dot for CGI, not a sniper laser sight like all the other ones."

marvelstudios,3e0wu4,Silverparachute,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:57 2015 UTC,"It's called an NDA and it probably has some very strict clauses about termination of present and future contacts and forfeiting any previous salary. That's what I'd do, at least."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,schm0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know it's about an NDA.

marvelstudios,3e0wu4,Silverparachute,15,Tue Jul 21 15:52:53 2015 UTC,I'm really hoping that it's just Easter eggs that set up Thor 3. Avengers 2 focused WAY too much on setting up other films that it barely focused on itself.
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,Mamsies,12,Tue Jul 21 11:04:41 2015 UTC,I feel like the Thor pool scene would have worked much better as a post credits scene.
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,SirHoneyDip,11,Tue Jul 21 13:37:30 2015 UTC,"Or if they would've made the movie 3 hours and actually used the whole scene. The scene sounded amazing, they just cut too much of it."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,Mark_1231,2,Tue Jul 21 14:17:56 2015 UTC,Yep.  I agree that they definitely tried to do too many things with AoU and it suffered for it.  Or just let it be 10 minutes longer and let those weirdly cramped story lines breathe.....

marvelstudios,3e0wu4,merelyadoptedthedark,3,Tue Jul 21 14:36:33 2015 UTC,"Off the top of memory, the Avengers Initiative subplot, black widow, caps shield, and thors hammer."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,AcesCharles2,9,Tue Jul 21 14:42:35 2015 UTC,"Avengers was barely a mention, black widow served an actual purpose to drive the plot forward, Cap's shield was an easter egg, and Thor's hammer was a post credit scene and had nothing to do with the plot."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,merelyadoptedthedark,7,Tue Jul 21 14:45:55 2015 UTC,"and Thor's hammer was a post credit scene and had nothing to do with the plot.   Well, aside from pulling Coulson out of the movie halfway through (we just don't learn that the call was about Thor's hammer until the post-credits). I agree about all of the rest, though, and I don't even like IM2. The ""Avengers setup"" was the least of its problems."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,CountScarlioni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:01:37 2015 UTC,"The main characters of Iron Man 2 are Tony Stark, James Rhodes, and Pepper Potts. The villains are Ivan Vanko and Justin Hammer.  Justin has Tony's wealth and connections, but not his skill. In contrast, Ivan has Tony's ingenuity, but has no resources. Both hate Stark for different reasons. Justin dislikes Tony for making him lose his government contracts. This plays in with the government wanting control of one of Tony's suits. Ivan hates Tony because Howard Stark had his dad deported. In the meantime, Tony is dealing with the fact that his arc reactor is poisoning him. This is what causes Rhodey to steal one of his suits. Tony solves this problem by looking at his father's records, which draws on the idea of fixing his father's mistakes (Vanko).   Now, there's enough there for a whole movie, easily. But for some reason, Black Widow, Nick Fury and even Coulson are major characters in the movie. The only thing Black Widow really does in the movie is serve as the interest of Tony's attention that stops him from realizing his love for Pepper. Everything else she does, as well as Nick Fury, is either specifically constructed so they have something to do, or could easily be replaced by, say, Happy Hogan."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,Mullet_Ben,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:03 2015 UTC,Black widow was a semi major character. Fury and Coulson had like one or two scenes each. They were not major characters.

marvelstudios,3e0wu4,legopieface,3,Tue Jul 21 15:35:28 2015 UTC,"I'll agree that Iron Man 2 set up Avengers, but Thor stood fine on it's own. It had a full arc, and other than the post-credits scene I don't think it would have been different if The Avengers was in production yet.   How did Thor 2 set up Avengers 2? At all? It did more to set up Infinity War (by introducing another gem), but again: it stood on it's own. Not the highest quality, but it wasn't bogged down by world building.   What do you mean Cap 2 built to the Return of SHIELD in Avengers 2? Cap 2 was the movie that tore down SHIELD? Do you mean the Hydra base? If so, then that's an odd complaint: the Hydra base could have been any generic bad guys, the fact that it was Hydra just helped with the connective tissue."
marvelstudios,3e0wu4,--Petrichor--,3,Tue Jul 21 15:40:27 2015 UTC,"Thor being earth-centric was a major part of his character in the comics. Also, that was a minor plot point in Thor 2, it's not like it was dragged down by that plot point that entire movie, it wasn't even mentioned until the last scene.   Also, the disintegration of SHIELD wasn't necessary for Age of Ultron. It's a common thread, sure, but Cap 2 had it's own payoff."

Cap 2 was really good about establishing some definitive changes, so I hope that's the same here, but it's looking like it's going to be as bogged down by new characters and future set up as AoU was."

marvelstudios,3e3k52,mooncakes92,3,Tue Jul 21 18:47:05 2015 UTC,I rather see a prequel miniseries based on the Bitter March
marvelstudios,3e3k52,Inspace96,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:19 2015 UTC,"How about this: Ant-Man, Wasp, and Agent Carter v Winter Soldier and Hydra (they wouldn't be out on the open Hydra members, just aiding the Winter Soldier).   Have old Howard Stark show up too. Maybe have Stark and Carter in Fury / Hill type roles. Maybe have a young Alexander Pierce show up top"
marvelstudios,3e3k52,dirty30m,2,Tue Jul 21 19:11:40 2015 UTC,Get Brad Pitt for young Pierce.  Heh.
marvelstudios,3e3k52,megabyte1,2,Tue Jul 21 19:15:33 2015 UTC,Most definitely.  I was thinking how interesting it was that MCU Cap had missed the entire Cold War.  What a big piece of the 20th century American experience not to have for yourself.
marvelstudios,3e3k52,megabyte1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:44 2015 UTC,It'd be interesting but I wish we had a time machine to get a younger Michael Douglas to be the lead in an Ant-Man prequel. I know there's a prequel comic about it but i'd rather a full film about it.
marvelstudios,3e3k52,TheJoshider10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:34:30 2015 UTC,"Simply put, fuck yes. And throw John Walker in as imposter Cap/US Agent as well."
marvelstudios,3e3k52,Totesbannedx2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:37:00 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah! I'm not saying that it should be, but if Marvel committed to a ""dark, serious"" type; this right here would be the subject. It potentially could be an R-rated film, similar to Deadpool. Winter Soldier in the Cold War would be great (even though X-Men: First Class handled it superbly). I want like to see a small portion of flashbacks: Korea, Vietnam, major events like that (Winter Soldier Kennedy Assassination👍 - was Bucky on the grassy knoll - I think so). Seeing him during the Cuban Missile crisis. I'm not sure about a plot, I like alternate history and weaving Marvel into the framework of factual events. I'll be with him til the end of the line. 🌟"
marvelstudios,3e3k52,plymouthpower,2,Tue Jul 21 19:41:58 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see it integrated into Agent Carter, actually."

marvelstudios,3e3k52,TARDISd,2,Tue Jul 21 18:38:14 2015 UTC,"I think it will be, with Dottie not being dead, and with Leviathan."
marvelstudios,3e3k52,megabyte1,0,Tue Jul 21 19:15:08 2015 UTC,"Plus assuming it airs in the winter again, it would be the perfect way to tie directly into Civil War. Season 1 laid plenty of groundwork, it would almost seem like a huge missed opportunity if we don't get at least a little Winter Soldier in there."
marvelstudios,3e38pu,Breaking-Lost,4,Tue Jul 21 16:51:22 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS AHEAD  Peyton Reed revealed an alternate ending that dealt with the nefarious Carson, as played by character actor Martin Donovan.   “At the end of the movie he gets away and has these Cross particles, and there was a sequence where Ant-Man has an encounter with him,” Reed confirms. “But then for a couple reasons, it felt like maybe we should leave those particles out there. In that original thing, he took Martin Donovan out and got the particles.”"
marvelstudios,3e38pu,kaimason1,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:47 2015 UTC,"Glad they left that out, it sounds like it would have made the HYDRA angle completely pointless in addition to being contradictory (between AoU and the end of AoS S2 it's made to seem like HYDRA is pretty much dead at this point, certainly like there shouldn't be remaining high ranking former SHIELD leadership, and should have been in no position to buy the Yellowjacket). At least this way it seems like it could lead into AoS S3 HYDRA stuff and Zemo's HYDRA in Civil War. I still feel like AoS could have just led directly into Zemo's HYDRA (rather than what it seems like will happen now, Ward's team finding Carson's HYDRA which eventually gets absorbed by Zemo's HYDRA) and they should have brought back AIM instead of continuing the overuse of HYDRA though."
marvelstudios,3e38pu,crusf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:04 2015 UTC,Really curious as to where and how those particles are going to be used in the MCU.
marvelstudios,3e0w79,marvelavengers,31,Tue Jul 21 02:35:19 2015 UTC,Man I can't wait now i am so excited to see this show. I can't wait to see how they portray her powers especially the flying aspect which I hope they keep. I am also happy hearing about the high praise especially from the guy who created the character. I can't wait to see the trailer soon and the show.
marvelstudios,3e0w79,SwagBelow,7,Tue Jul 21 02:45:12 2015 UTC,im not gonna act like i know how they going to portray the character but my educated guess says since this after her super hero days and purple man already was in her life before! This Jessica Jones is powered down meaning her powers are powered down
marvelstudios,3e0w79,soulbreaker1418,6,Tue Jul 21 03:55:18 2015 UTC,"i really think is not necesary, in cases like Thor was pretty clear some the characters had to be powered down, but she barely uses her powers and, very important, to be useful in The Defenders she has to be powerful otherwise she would only serves as a detective"
marvelstudios,3e0w79,soulbreaker1418,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:41:15 2015 UTC,no i mean its in the comic book lol after she done being a superhero and going through the trauma with purple man she lost some of her powers or should i say her powers got powered down~
marvelstudios,3e0w79,ContinuumGuy,7,Tue Jul 21 05:55:52 2015 UTC,"fo what i´ve read what happened is she lost practice and kind of had a phobia to them, i have to guess by the time she was an Avenger her powers were as good as before if not better"
marvelstudios,3e0w79,faggot_human_trash,3,Tue Jul 21 06:09:19 2015 UTC,yea but this period is where they might be powered down cause i think they wanna keep jessica sorta grounded so maybe no flying but super strength idk about the invulnerability cause some pics on set shows her hurt and bleeding so
marvelstudios,3e0w79,jim25y,16,Tue Jul 21 06:25:40 2015 UTC,Hype Intensifies

marvelstudios,3e0w79,SirHoneyDip,8,Tue Jul 21 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"Q4 2015, most likely. If the production schedule is similar to Daredevil -- then post-production should wrap-up late-Aug-Sept.   Release I reckon is late Oct-Dec 2015."
marvelstudios,3e0w79,nvroutofthismaze,3,Tue Jul 21 03:27:49 2015 UTC,"By this schedule, we should be getting a trailer and/or some clips any day now."
marvelstudios,3e0w79,soulbreaker1418,3,Tue Jul 21 10:24:34 2015 UTC,I'd guess during either NYCC or D23.
marvelstudios,3e0w79,ryguy2503,2,Tue Jul 21 13:33:09 2015 UTC,DD was released April 10th but the first trailer didn't drop until March 10th.  So it's not like theatrical releases where there is months and months of build-up.
marvelstudios,3e0w79,OsteoBiflex,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"that is being too optimistic imo, a late november/early december is more likely"

marvelstudios,3e0w79,dra39437,5,Tue Jul 21 07:04:44 2015 UTC,Ok this news is really reassuring. Its cool that he loves it because I was very nervous when they announced this series because Jessica is such an obscure character. I now feel good about this show.
marvelstudios,3e0w79,joalr0,2,Tue Jul 21 03:06:12 2015 UTC,"I think it works better to do these shows with obscure characters. The general public had no preconceived notions walking into Guardians of the Galaxy and it worked because it didn't have to stand up to an ideal. I was maybe half an episode in watching Daredevil when I realized how good all of these Netflix shows were going to be. Because I hate Daredevil in the comics and if they can change my black heart on that, then they can do anything."

marvelstudios,3dzd7r,cocainelady,14,Tue Jul 21 11:57:30 2015 UTC,"That's actually not bad news, since it had the lowest opening weekend of any Marvel movie thus far."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,MrTerrificPants,30,Mon Jul 20 19:41:14 2015 UTC,2nd lowest.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,dannzo_29,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:02:39 2015 UTC,Adjusted for inflation its the lowest.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,sgthombre,3,Tue Jul 21 04:46:37 2015 UTC,Behind Hulk or Thor 2 I'm guessing?
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,Theniallmc,18,Mon Jul 20 20:51:51 2015 UTC,"Just ahead of Incredible Hulk (~$55M), but surprisingly not that far behind the first Thor (~$66M) or the first Cap (~$65M).  Thor: TDW did better than either of us expected (~$86M)."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,Data_Error,31,Mon Jul 20 21:11:47 2015 UTC,"Let's remember the first Cap movie: $140 million budget, it only made $370 million global.   This cost $130 million and already had made $114 million global. Since post first Cap movie, Marvel's brand name exploded globally thanks to THE AVENGERS, so yeah I would be shocked if this made less than 400 million global.   Point is, it's getting a sequel. More importantly, Rudd is in CIVIL WAR and heck, what if he's also in INFINITY WAR alongside Lilly, giving them more visibility? Then Marvel reckons the sequel will make even more money.  I mean TWS did outgross MAN OF STEEL, after all."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,ToddPolt,8,Mon Jul 20 21:18:47 2015 UTC,"this movie getting a sequel/prequel then my dick would cry  i'm sorry, i've just been a pym/ant-fan for so long it's just, oh my god, this movie was fucking great, i still have trouble processing it"
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,Spycrab_Killer,5,Tue Jul 21 02:57:35 2015 UTC,Thor 2 got a bump from avengers. it was a bad movie (the only really bad movie mavel's made) but as a pseudo sequel to avengers it was guaranteed a minimum opening
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,chicagofirefifa3,18,Mon Jul 20 21:32:30 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed TDW, and I feel like it was a solidly above average action film. Now The Incredible Hulk, that movie was plainly average and I say that as a huge Marvel fan."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,Just_shut_up_bro,3,Mon Jul 20 22:48:17 2015 UTC,"I found TDW to be pretty average. Not BAD but pretty average. That said, I quite enjoyed TIH."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,CX316,3,Tue Jul 21 04:13:49 2015 UTC,Thats so funny. I feel the exact way but with the movies reversed.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,TripleSkeet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:44:39 2015 UTC,why was TDW solidly above average (perhaps it's my fault for going to a marvel studios fan site but i don't see it as having really any redeming qualities outside of the fun Cap Cameo)
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,chicagofirefifa3,4,Tue Jul 21 00:05:29 2015 UTC,"(I'm not OP, by the way)   Well, I don't particularly like the film, but I'm not one to complain about more Hiddleston's Loki."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,rofpo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:35:57 2015 UTC,As far as plot and writing go theyre about the same IMO but at least TDW has enough cool visuals and interesting characters to keep me smiling. TIH has some cool scenes but overall feels too bland.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,idiottech,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:07:48 2015 UTC,i love that interesting character Christopher Eccleston played too /s
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,chicagofirefifa3,3,Tue Jul 21 01:09:09 2015 UTC,What a waste. Any stunt double could have done that part. There was no acting involved.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,Heiroglyph,8,Tue Jul 21 01:13:53 2015 UTC,"Come on man. TDW isn't that bad. I can't even sit through TIH anymore without getting up for some snacks or something. It doesn't hold up well at all. I think TFA and Thor are a little better than TDW but not too much. Point is, it is simply a mediocre film. The only really boring MCU film is TIH IMO."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,PMMeYourBootyPics,-6,Mon Jul 20 23:00:21 2015 UTC,Don't forget IM3.  That was dangerously close to Spider-man 3 levels of bad.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,Heiroglyph,11,Tue Jul 21 01:15:17 2015 UTC,"Upvote for being my only squadmate in 'Fuck Iron Man 3', but no way was it anywhere NEAR Spidey 3.  Iron Man 3 had shitty parts (the kid, the Mandarin fake out shit, general plotholes) but Spider-Man 3 was just shitting on me the whole 2.5 hours."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,TMoney1882,2,Tue Jul 21 02:08:49 2015 UTC,"Spiderman 3 was great if you take it for what it is,  Sam Raimi flipping Sony off for their meddling in the movie. You can just feel the contempt ozze from it."

marvelstudios,3dzd7r,your_mind_aches,2,Tue Jul 21 05:55:32 2015 UTC,The mandarin fake out was my favourite thing. It was such a fantastic moment when everyone in the theatre realised that he was just a bumbling actor!!! Iron Man 3 did have its bad parts but i think that was a fantastic moment!
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,Switch_Off,2,Tue Jul 21 09:56:23 2015 UTC,"Agree to disagree my friend. I just got so hyped Ben Kingsley was going to play the fookin Mandarin and own it... And then it's Killian, AKA typical MCU villain number six."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,TMoney1882,0,Tue Jul 21 13:36:29 2015 UTC,"I did say dangerously close.  It's as close as the MCU has come thus far, I'd say."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,Heiroglyph,2,Tue Jul 21 02:10:52 2015 UTC,the only really bad movie mavel's made   You see this is where we disagree! I really love TDW!
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,your_mind_aches,-5,Tue Jul 21 05:54:57 2015 UTC,"Incorrect, TIH is the only bad movie marvel has ever made."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,fistkick18,5,Mon Jul 20 22:06:28 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  For a man on the run movie, it's really good."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,mastyrwerk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:50:47 2015 UTC,"For an MCU movie, its really bad. And come on, that genre is filled with movies like The Fugitive, Terminator 1 & 2, and the original Total Recall. Not that great compared to movies like that."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,fistkick18,7,Mon Jul 20 23:13:32 2015 UTC,When was the last time you watched it?  The chase through rooftops at the beginning was well choreographed.  The fight on the campus was awesome.  The fight at the end in Harlem was just as good as anything else the Hulk does.  Maybe it's just cause I like Ed Norton.  He sells a very focused Banner that hasn't given up on a cure.  I find his struggle compelling.  Incredible Hulk is one of the most underrated of the MCU movies.  But that's me.  I also really like Thor The Dark World.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,mastyrwerk,0,Tue Jul 21 02:04:05 2015 UTC,I actually first saw it about 6 months ago when I first bought it. Not gonna lie... I fell asleep about half way through. And I've also seen the ending fight on youtube and wasn't really impressed. Not really a fan of the Hulk in the first place. I think he works much better as a side character in the Avengers series. I found the cure-hunting part to drag on. I honestly don't know what could have made the movie more compelling for me to watch. I guess I just don't like the premise?
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,fistkick18,2,Tue Jul 21 02:27:34 2015 UTC,"Guess not.  I do agree Hulk makes a better side character/obstacle than protagonist, but for a Hulk movie, I don't think we could have gotten better at the time."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,mastyrwerk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:56:31 2015 UTC,I loved it. To each his own I guess.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,TripleSkeet,4,Tue Jul 21 05:49:01 2015 UTC,I think Incredible Hulk was a better movie than Dark World. Dark World was surprisingly generic given its premise and overused Kat Dennings and didn't focus on the villain at all.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,suss2it,2,Mon Jul 20 23:02:55 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely agree to that. I think if they had taken every minute spent on jane and friends on the rest of the plot, it could have been one of the best MCU movies to date."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,fistkick18,2,Mon Jul 20 23:20:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, put that time into developing Malekith and suddenly you've improved the movie significantly."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,babatazyah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:53:21 2015 UTC,"While you're free to your own opinion, I would disagree and say that Thor 2 and Iron Man 2 are also pretty bad"
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,griver94,8,Mon Jul 20 22:50:49 2015 UTC,"Thor 2 isn't spectacular by any means. but honestly, when you look at all the good parts, such as the invasion of Asgard, the final battle, and any scene with loki and thor together, it is vastly superior to TIH. Yeah, jane and friends are annoying as fuck, but thats really the worst of it.  I hear that a lot about Iron Man 2, but I will suggest that you give it another watch. I actually prefer it to IM 1 & 3, because the villain is evil for more than bullshit reasons. And the whole ""bord"" thing is so overblown, its really not that much of the movie. its like tony stark versus russian tony stark, whats not to love?"
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,fistkick18,2,Mon Jul 20 23:18:32 2015 UTC,"I think if you dig deep into any marvel movie you're going to get some really cool bits here and there, but that doesn't make the movie good. I think the simplest way to describe Thor 2 is that it's just bland and a bit forgettable, if it was any other action film that wasn't in the MCU it would be looked at as just boring I feel.   Iron man 2, I've seen a good 5 times (no idea why, I feel I've had a few movie marathons at a friends house or something) and I've disliked it more and more each time I've seen it to be honest, but it's all subjective I guess!"
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,griver94,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:30:39 2015 UTC,It wouldn't have been bad if they would have let Norton do his thing. I still liked it though.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,Vincentamerica,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:51:48 2015 UTC,Meh. I think Norton is really overrated. Only movie I really liked with him in it was American History X.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,fistkick18,3,Mon Jul 20 23:19:16 2015 UTC,Clearly you haven't seen Birdman.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,Data_Error,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:45:53 2015 UTC,"Saw Birdman, was not impressed. Honestly didn't like the movie."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,fistkick18,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:55:13 2015 UTC,Rounders and Death to Smoochy as well. But I didnt like him for the role of Banner.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,TripleSkeet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:50:50 2015 UTC,What didn't he get to do? I know he wrote a good portion of the film.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,brasco975,-6,Tue Jul 21 06:25:58 2015 UTC,Iron man 2 and 3 were bad.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,ReZ-115,-2,Mon Jul 20 23:46:43 2015 UTC,i meant really bad and IM3 was average. IM2 was just mediocre crap (like Hulk)
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,chicagofirefifa3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:56:07 2015 UTC,"IM3, IMO, was worse than TDW."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,JuanRiveara,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:13:51 2015 UTC,"It's a very different type of movie to the rest of the series, which is why a lot of people are very polarised about it, you either love it or you hate it with a vengeance for some reason."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,CX316,6,Tue Jul 21 04:19:02 2015 UTC,Damn that sucks. Its my favourite Marvel movie yet
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,Theniallmc,13,Mon Jul 20 20:51:39 2015 UTC,"Let's hang out for a bit on it, though. Word of mouth is gonna be very good for Ant-Man, I think!"
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,Ninja_of_Athens,3,Mon Jul 20 23:20:19 2015 UTC,"I hope so, as this movie didn't have the same hype surrounding it as the other movies in the MCU (not even Guardians of the Galaxy)"
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,programeiro,3,Mon Jul 20 23:28:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I just weeted about it after reading it was the lowest
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,Theniallmc,4,Tue Jul 21 02:04:35 2015 UTC,Im guessing rudd's paycheck  wayyy lower the RDJ...so thats probably why.
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,hellsbellltrudy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:16:48 2015 UTC,Should be around The same size paycheck as RDJs in first iron man.

marvelstudios,3dzd7r,genchris,2,Tue Jul 21 05:51:20 2015 UTC,"Helps when you don't have RDJs massive salary.  Seriously, I wish that actor's salaries were taken out of the equation when movies/shows discuss budgets. I know quality actors and actresses are important but I am more interested in seeing reports about the money spent on the physical shooting and vfx."
marvelstudios,3dzd7r,jmster109,2,Tue Jul 21 14:16:33 2015 UTC,I guess you can say it had a...tiny budget. YEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!  I'll shut up now.

marvelstudios,3e09f3,Deadpoolbub,19,Mon Jul 20 23:29:31 2015 UTC,Christophe Beck did so amazingly well with this score. It touched on every emotional tone and then some. I loved that Ant-man had a very distinct and unique theme. I also loved hearing the themes for The Avengers and Falcon in there (and though I don't know if it is credited to him - the Winter Soldier theme for the post credit).  Not only do I hope this theme follows Ant-man through all of his appearances - I really hope we see Christophe Beck get more shots to take on Marvel movies. I think he proved he can make a sublime musical additional to the MCU.
marvelstudios,3e09f3,encom_cto,6,Tue Jul 21 00:45:58 2015 UTC,"I hope he does too, he'd be better than Tyler who only did good in Iron Man 3."
marvelstudios,3e09f3,The_Best_01,7,Tue Jul 21 00:59:38 2015 UTC,His score for AoU was quite disappointing though.
marvelstudios,3e09f3,encom_cto,10,Tue Jul 21 02:29:13 2015 UTC,"I have to agree that his AOU score was a disappointment. Elfman saved the AOU score and I really wish he'd done the whole score.   Tyler seems to lack the maturity of a seasoned composer that can take and use others themes and motifs. Elfman, Jackman and Beck all took others themes and made scores that used them and complimented them."
marvelstudios,3e09f3,The_Best_01,6,Tue Jul 21 02:39:51 2015 UTC,"The Cap 2 score was great, glad that Jackman's coming back for Civil War."
marvelstudios,3e09f3,Cyndaquilfan123,2,Tue Jul 21 03:00:15 2015 UTC,I actually liked the AOU score...
marvelstudios,3e09f3,encom_cto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, don't get me wrong - I love (parts of) the AOU score too - but all of the tracks and pieces seem to have the credit go to Danny Elfman that I find myself listening to over and over and actually capturing the emotions of what's going on. The Tyler credited music for AOU just seems like he was not focused or trying to make something grand, like Silvestri did wonderfully, and failing."
marvelstudios,3e09f3,wheeze_the_juice,3,Tue Jul 21 14:50:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the best parts of that score were the parts with the first movie's theme. They should've just got Silvestri back."
marvelstudios,3e09f3,HoennBorn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:59:55 2015 UTC,Agreed. Sadly he was busy and couldn't do the second movie.

marvelstudios,3e09f3,Haaselh0ff,3,Tue Jul 21 04:51:57 2015 UTC,"Sounds very heist-y. Like Mission Impossible, or Ocean's 11. Music for making a high-stakes secret incursion into a ridiculously high-tech stronghold."

My favorite character, the best action, and a cool subversive story. Iron Man (4 1/2 stars) - How did they make such an awesome movie on their first try? Seeing the red-and-yellow armor for the first time is one of the all-time coolest moments in any super hero movie. The Avengers (4 1/2 stars) - This movie just works from start to finish. Funny, with great characters, and great action choreography. Captain America: The First Avenger (4 1/2 stars) - Little biased because Cap is my favorite character, but I think this movie kills it. When he jumps on the hand grenade, you learn everything you need to know about Steve Rogers in a single moment.  Avengers: Age of Ultron (4 stars) - Marvel's most underrated film. There is so much going on in this movie in terms of character and in terms of theme, so it takes a couple viewings to really start picking it all up. Ant-Man (4 stars) - The only MCU film I've only seen once, so this placement could change. Right now I'm still riding high from seeing it over the weekend. Hilarious with awesome special effects. Guardians of the Galaxy (4 stars) - Feels weird to put it so low, but these movies have to go somewhere. Great characters and humor, and a unique visual style. Loses a little for me because I'm not a ""space opera"" guy. Iron Man 3 (4 stars) - One of my favorite scenes of super heroism (falling out of the plane) and some killer one-liners. And I actually really like the way they handled the Mandarin. Thor: The Dark World (3 1/2 stars) - The relationship between Thor and Loki and the really cool final scene with the portals save this movie for me.  Thor (3 1/2 stars) - Didn't like it the first time I saw it, but it grew on me. I like that it takes place in a small town in New Mexico. In fact I like in general that the MCU isn't as Manhattan-focused as the comics are. The Incredible Hulk (3 1/2 stars) - A good movie, but has some problems knowing what it wants to say. Also, developed at the same time as Iron Man, and so it's the only movie that wasn't influenced by Iron Man, making it feel like it doesn't always fit in with the rest of the MCU. Iron Man 2 (3 stars) - Has some great scenes I really like (race track, Widow taking out the guards, anytime Justin Hammer talks), but is kind of a mess overall. The final battle scene bores me to death."

marvelstudios,3e0emv,sanecrazyman,2,Tue Jul 21 07:35:14 2015 UTC,"Dang, you thought Thor: TDW was that bad?"
marvelstudios,3e0emv,killerbekilled92,4,Tue Jul 21 04:14:09 2015 UTC,It's the only MCU movie I think is legitimately bad. The only parts that hold up are Loki's scenes. Thor barely does anything as a character & the assault on Asgard scene is just a bunch of CGI nonsense that doesn't make any sense & doesn't even have any of the main characters fighting in it.  I don't like saying I hate it because I love the MCU....but I do. :/
marvelstudios,3e0emv,Elogotar,2,Tue Jul 21 07:58:33 2015 UTC,"loki scenes, and the portal-hopping fight scene was pretty awesome. everything else was kind of forgettable. i ranked it last, too."

They're all above a 6 for me :)  And age of Ultron, I was disappointed because it really needed more time to flesh out the story, but that's just lost potential. The end product my not have lived up to my 10/10 predictions but the ensemble cast, the amazing acting, the action, the superheroes, especially the vision are elements make it as good as winter soldier for me. But I completely understand why other people may have been disappointed."
marvelstudios,3e0emv,phath0m,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, Age of Ultron just didn't have enough meat. It would have been really really good if they had just fleshed it out a bit more.   I already forgot how I ranked Winter Soldier, but I put it up pretty high. In part because it had subtext.   I put Guardians down at a somewhat low place. I was really disappointed by the portrayal of Ronan. It just wasn't Ronan at all. For me, that's really the biggest thing that's keeping Guardians down. It would have been awesome if the villain hadn't been cut out of cardboard."

Thor 2 is so visually interesting, the whole scene when they're planning and executing their escape from Asgard is wonderfully done, and Thor is awesome. Iron Man 3 has its moments, too. I've almost never been as pissed off during a movie as when Killian said ""Shame... I woulda caught her."""

marvelstudios,3e0emv,monteq75,0,Tue Jul 21 04:36:50 2015 UTC,"Mine ended up as...  1) Guardians - A+ No Question. Easy pick. Not close for me.  2) Iron Man - A This is where rankings immediately get blurry. This movie rocked. Literally. Thanks AC-DC! Great story, pacing, action, etc..  2b) Avengers - A- So good! Minus some of the whiny convos.  2c) Ant-Man - A- Can't wait to see it again! Well-paced Marvel heist movie with amazing action sequences and wonderful humor.  2d) Avengers 2 - A- What's not to love when the gang gets together?! Highlight for me may have been seeing Klaw and all the vibramium/wikanda references! I'm dying for the Black Panther movie! He's my favorite character in all of comics by far!  2e) Captain America: The First Avenger - B+ Call me crazy. I thought it was a damn near perfect Cap flick and loved seeing the old-school Marvel world.  2f) Captain America: The Winter Soldier - B+ Great movie! I think the fact it caught us all by surprise gives it a slight over-hyped factor. Also, great twists in the plot!  8) Thor - B This is where things get more clear again. Great Thor movie! Forgettable villain...just kidding ;)  9) Iron Man 3 - B Way better than 2. Although, Iron Man seemed to have forgotten his intellect at times, namely being completely unprepared and unable to defeat a few helicopters when he had like 50 independently operable suits in his basement. That fight scene should have lasted no more than 10 seconds.  10) Iron Man 2 - B- Such a letdown from the high of the first. ""Awe man! It was cool watching Ironman fight another mech suit! I wonder what they'll think of next!...oh...more mech suits. Neat."" That said, watching him rediscover a new element was pretty rad!  11) The Incredible Hulk - C+ Liv Tyler. Pass.  12) Thor: The Dark World - C Nobody knows what happened in this movie. I think it's cleverly designed to make you forget 90% of it on purpose to trick you into rewatching it....because otherwise....maybe not. Not all bad though."

marvelstudios,3e0emv,manlysneeze,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:05:55 2015 UTC,"for me:  Guardians of the galaxy 9/10  easily the best IMO. Great story, great music, best special effects. Has a tons of characters but never feels busy at all. Some of the best action and jokes  Avengers Age of Ultron 8/10  This movie is my favorite example of great crisscrossing of everything. Watching this movie solo is probably the worst experience out of all of the MCU movies so far since so much information and backstory comes from everything, movies and TV shows alike. I also liked Ultron a lot and Scarlet witch and the vision even more  The Winter Solider 8/10  Some of the best action in the MCU and does a great job of advacing the main plot and caps plot at the same time. Hydra reveal had me totally surprised and I loved it  Avengers 8/10  Movie that really got me into the MCU. Great origin story, very streamlined. Love the end battle though I think my favorite fight is Thor v the Hulk.  Iron man 8/10  Where it all started. Loved it in theaters but was dismissive that they would ever actually get to the avengers  Ant-Man 7/10  A surprise to me that this is so high on the list. Despite feeling a little flat I really enjoyed this movie. Peyton Reed did a good job of emulating Edgar Wright even if the final product could have used a little more umph. Scott Lang was my least favorite character but that is only because I liked everyone else a lot.  Everything below this is kind of the same. 5/10-6/10 I enjoyed them and like their palce in the MCU but they dont get me all fired up like the ones above."

The rest of the show was not in that purgatory, because if it was why would they need two purgatories?"
marvelstudios,3dzu87,DesertScorpion4,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:02 2015 UTC,"Don't care, the writing was a cop out. They couldn't explain what they created so they wished it away with plot magic."
marvelstudios,3dzu87,schm0,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:21 2015 UTC,"It's not.  It's hard to explain why a lot of people didn't like it if you haven't seen it, suffice to say that most of the people (that I've talked to at least) misinterpreted the hell out of it.    Plus, I always saw the show itself as more of a character based show than a mystery show anyway.  I went in to it in the beginning wanting all the answers, but knowing I'd never get them and coming to terms with that early on."
marvelstudios,3dzu87,SuperVoodoo,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:57 2015 UTC,"Except the characters were constantly exploring the mysteries.  There were all these connections and they were strange.  I was constantly wondering what it all meant.  The finale just said ""nothing. It all meant nothing"".  So yeah.  It depends on whether you were watching the show because of the characters or because of the mystery.  If you were watching the show because of the intrigue it created, it the finale was awful."
marvelstudios,3dzu87,joalr0,3,Tue Jul 21 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"That's definitely fair.  I certainly don't fault anyone for not liking it and I (somewhat) get why a lot of people don't - but the island being purgatory thing that people still didn't let go of, even after the finale, grinds my gears considering it's pretty well established that they were definitely on the island, and only the flash sideways and forwards were the interim.  Just out of curiosity - what was your personal biggest let down surrounding a mystery that was never explained?"
marvelstudios,3dzu87,SuperVoodoo,2,Tue Jul 21 15:46:34 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I haven't really watched or thought about it since it ended.  I just remember that they tended to answer questions with questions.  Like ""Oh, the whole reason this thing on the island has been happening is because you gotta protect the light.""  ""Uh, what the fuck is the light?!""  ""Oops, shows over"".  Now perhaps they answered the ""what is the light"" thing and I just forgot, but if they did I'm certain they answered it with another question.  I don't care if the answers lie in science or whatever.  I simply want to understand what the basic logic was in the show.  What kind of universe was this show?  What are the rules of this universe?  I don't care if it's the same rules as our Universe, clearly the MCU uses different rules from ours.  I just want to know what they are, and they never got around to explaining that."

marvelstudios,3e04bk,Robotshavenohearts,7,Tue Jul 21 07:12:35 2015 UTC,"Easy.   It's probably too late for anyone to read this, but the scene would take place on an episode of Daredevil. In my mind, it would be the only direct interaction that would ever occur between The Avengers and The Defenders:   EPISODE SETUP: Natasha Romanov, unable to track down the man who is Daredevil, has instead tracked his movements. She finds herself in a location that turns out to be a showdown with The Hand.  Ruthless and outnumbered, the two narrowly escape the fray. Natasha was sliced in the abdomen during the battle.  SCENE  EXT - ROOFTOP - NIGHT  Daredevil places Natasha against the low wall of a rooftop. As the scene progresses, Natasha becomes less and less lucid. Even as the scene begins, she has trouble keeping her hand over her wound.  DD: Keep pressure on it. You've already lost nearly two pints of blood.  NR: We have to keep going. We've left a trail of blood–they'll track us--  DD: No they won't. (beat) Anyway, you can't go any further.  NR: Okay. So I'm just going to bleed out here? Fuck that.   Natasha tries to stand up and Daredevil forces her hand into her own wound. She SCREAMS in pain and stumbles back down. She strikes Daredevil with her free hand, but he grabs it by the wrist.  DD: I know you've been tracking me for days. Why the hell are you here?  NR: My name is Natasha--  DD: I know who you are. It's hard to live in this world and not who you are, Ms. Romanov.  NR: Then you know why I'm here.  Pause.  DD: The Accords don't apply to me.   NR: Funny. That thing over your face looks an awful lot like a mask to me.  DD: I don't have any powers.  NR: Neither do I.   Pause. Natasha continues, standing firmly behind each word, but each is labored and difficult   NR: (Cont'd) I'm not here to make you sign anything, and I'm not here to arrest you. I'm not with Tony Stark, and I'm not with SHIELD. There's no government agency or corporate trust fund paying my rent. It's just me, asking for your help.   DD: I don't have any experience fighting gods or robots.  NR: You know, I used to be like you. Alone, paranoid, defiant, completely protective of my anonymity.  DD: With all due respect, Ms. Romanov, you were never anything like me. After the aliens rained from the sky, you and the rest of the Avengers were on every TV in every country in the world. You know where I was? On the ground, cleaning up the wreckage. Five years later, I'm still on the ground. I'm still cleaning up my city. Everyone refers to that day as ""New York."" Do you know what we call it? Hell. And that's what's left behind.  NR: We...saved your city. We saved...the world.  DD: You made this world. Every enemy the Avengers ever defeated is one they brought here. Or worse, one they made. The Accords are not right, but its defenders are not wrong. None of you are heroes. And your villains are no more villainous than they are human. Hell, most of them don't even bleed. They aren't bad, they're just big. Monsters, the real monsters, they all slithered out of the mess you left behind. You have no idea what evil is. You've never fought evil, you've just fought your own mistakes.   Daredevil pulls out a cellphone and starts to type a message.  DD: You don't need my help. This city needs my help. I may live in your world, Ms. Romanov, but you've got no place in mine.  Daredevil closes the phone and jumps over the edge. Natasha is nearly passed out, slumped against the wall.  NR: Ungrateful...I wasn't done...talking...  The door on the roof opens, CLAIRE TEMPLE runs out, squinting through the dark  CT: Matt? Where are you?  NR: (mumbled to herself) ...Matt??  Claire hears Natasha and rushes to her side.  You can guess where it goes from there (She cleans her wounds).   I had the whole episode planned out a few weeks back. Even started to write the spec. There was also a great scene between Matt Murdock and a young Peter Parker. I titled the script ""A City full of Spiders."""

marvelstudios,3dz3u5,Elementlegen,12,Mon Jul 20 21:04:25 2015 UTC,I mean I think they are trying to convey the comedic tone of the movie these are all cut from a scene where Scott uses the suit to make them win at craps.

But if you are only allotted x amount of minutes for a movie or something, this might be one that gets you to that 1:55 mark that the upper management wanted. Or maybe it didn't flow well with whatever was going on before/after this scene. Sort of stuck out as not completely necessary to the narrative. Man I hope the dvd cut has a half hour of this shit"

marvelstudios,3dyeth,Mark_1231,19,Tue Jul 21 03:38:49 2015 UTC,"age about one year for every 35 Earth years   This is more of a broad-scale correction, but it's an attitude plaguing society right down to the whole ""dog years"" thing.  Mammalian life generally has three stages: growth, adulthood, and aged. Growth is the period post-womb until finishing puberty as a fully-grown adult, usually between ages of 16 and 20. Adulthood is a stable state where you maintain roughly the same appearance and health between about 20 and 50. Starting around 35 and extending to death is aged, where your cells no longer have the complete ability to maintain themselves. Wrinkles, sagging breasts and testicles succumbing to gravity, increased risk of cancer and reduced immune system. The key point here though is failing cells.  This is why ""dog years"" make no sense. A dog is able to walk after a few days and is fully grown after about a year - much more than 7 times faster than human growth. Likewise dogs don't start ageing in the same sense as humans until much later in their life, a much slower timescale than humans.  By the same token there's no reason to argue Asgardians age ""one year for every 35 human years"". Their growth period is likely comparable to humans, at 15-20 years. Their adulthood period certainly spans thousands of years, give or take 5000 according to Loki. Their ageing period would seem the only part that might be relative."
marvelstudios,3dyeth,ethos1983,20,Mon Jul 20 17:02:06 2015 UTC,"It would be hilarious if it took an Asgardian 35 earth years to be able to properly stand. 105 years to properly master the alphabet, etc."

Correct me if I'm wrong). This means that Thor appeared, maybe, ten at this point in time. Now, in order for Thor to show up in Norse myth as an adult with a hammer, he would've had to grown into an adult quite quickly (like, less than 1/10 of the time until his appearance in Avengers). So, long story short, you're correct."

marvelstudios,3dyeth,navjot94,8,Tue Jul 21 17:29:05 2015 UTC,"General Relativity.  Time probably runs slower on Asgard because it's got a much larger gravity well. Like in Inception Interstellar when dude was on the planet near the black hole, he aged 7 minutes, but dude back on the ship aged like 40 years. Higher gravity would also explain the increased strength of Asgardians over Humans.  So while Thor is on Earth, he'd age at roughly the same rate as every other humanoid."
marvelstudios,3dyeth,navjot94,23,Mon Jul 20 16:56:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting notion but it's been debunked in the MCU. On AOS an Asgardian was revealed to be living on Earth since at least the Middle Ages and he still hadn't aged. Beyond that it's clear that Asgardians have a something of a healing factor and their long life spans may also be attributed to that. Thor, Fandral, Loki, and Sif have all been shown to survive serious beatings and stabbings only to be perfectly fine a short time later. Except for Frigga. I'm guessing injuries to he heart or brain are the only things that can't be regenerated."
marvelstudios,3dyeth,itshukokay,6,Mon Jul 20 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"Even in the movies, the amount of time that has passed on Asgard is the same amount of time that has passed on Earth (see the Warrior Three and Sif coming down to Earth to get Thor). The only time it gets weird is when, in Thor, there was a pattern of lightning storms weeks before Thor was sent to Earth. I think this is just because at first, Asgard was supposed to be a separate dimension, but that was changed when they decided to go cosmic with multiple planets and stuff."
marvelstudios,3dyeth,shotgunshutscakehole,3,Mon Jul 20 19:09:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the timelines on Earth and Asgard get a little muddy.

marvelstudios,3dyeth,dayungbenny,4,Mon Jul 20 20:13:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the timelines on Earth and Asgard get a little muddy. It did at first seem like a few seconds in Asgard was supposed to be weeks on Earth.   When did it seem like that?

marvelstudios,3dyeth,wagellanofspain,-5,Mon Jul 20 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"No. No. No.  Edit: I should explain things instead of just bitching. They are NOT aliens. There is a difference. Think about the rainbow bridge. The rainbow bridge is how they travel between the nine realms. Midgard is where earth is, and where any planets with extraterrestrials that we would call aliens are. Asgard is not just an alien planet. It is located on a completely different dimensional plane. So they are not gods in the traditional mythological, religious sense, they are still explained in a sci-fi way, but there is a clear difference between reaching Asgard vs. reaching different planet in space."
marvelstudios,3dyeth,dayungbenny,12,Mon Jul 20 18:00:12 2015 UTC,"They are 100% aliens by definition, as they are beings from another world. Now, the distinction between just an alien and a god would have to be magic. It is stated in the MCU that the Asgardians are highly technologically advanced, not magic. So we can conclude that they are simply aliens and not gods. I'm also fairly certain that it is inferred in the MCU that the nine realms are just planets connected across space-time by what seem to be wormholes, and the bifrost (which I think you are confusing with the rainbow bridge) is simply a teleportation system."
marvelstudios,3dyeth,donatello_vs_batman,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:37:43 2015 UTC,"Actually you are totally right, they are aliens in the broader sense of the word like illegal aliens, but the point I was trying to make is they are even further removed from our kind than an extra terrestrial because they are from not just another point in space but another dimension all together. Bifrost and rainbow bridge are same thing.   Do they ever state whether or not you could hypothetically reach Asgard with like a highly advanced spaceship? I was really under the impression that it was on an entirely different plane, but I guess I could just be inserting my own comic book knowledge."
marvelstudios,3dyeth,Lupin_AAGL,5,Mon Jul 20 18:49:10 2015 UTC,In the dark world malekith literally flies his spaceship to Asgard so I'd say they're the same dimension

But, I just read a bunch of comics with Malekith and as a dark elf he is from Svarthelheim, which would be a dimension unto itself.  Could it be that the ship has some sort of tech to travel between the different realms? Personally I just really hate this idea that the 9 realms are all just different planets and areas in space, which I guess is the correct MCU interpretation. If that is true then what the hell does midgard even represent? Is it just another word for earth?"
marvelstudios,3dyeth,dayungbenny,4,Mon Jul 20 22:37:44 2015 UTC,"I think you would be able to reach the other realms in a space ship. If I recall correctly, in TDW, there's a scene where Thor calls for his hammer, but then goes through a portal to another realm.  The hammer changes course and heads to space, which I'm assuming is the path to lead to Thor."

If a world has magic, that magic works on a certain way, and if it works in a certain way, it can be studied. And if it can be studied, it's science (or maybe physics, science is usually about having or gaining knowledge about something)   Still, I hope they don't go too far in trying to make magic make sense. Doctor Strange is Doctor Strange. It's supposed to have some mysticism. It's not a title like like Fantastic Four or Spider-Man, which tend to be much more science oriented (although Spider-Man does sometimes dabble a bit in the mysticism side as well)."

marvelstudios,3dyeth,Super_Pan,3,Mon Jul 20 23:40:26 2015 UTC,But Thor doesn't care. He values human life because he has been human himself.
marvelstudios,3dyeth,dayungbenny,2,Mon Jul 20 17:10:56 2015 UTC,Not in the MCU.
marvelstudios,3dyeth,Super_Pan,9,Mon Jul 20 18:06:21 2015 UTC,"He loses his powers in Thor 1 and is sent to Earth, where he realizes he has human limitations. So, not literally a human, but he has lived as one."
marvelstudios,3dyeth,dayungbenny,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:08:51 2015 UTC,The Thor movie is the MCU. It's even called Thor. I don't know how this could be any more clear....
marvelstudios,3dyeth,Super_Pan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:46:02 2015 UTC,I did not say that the movie was not in the MCU I said he was not a human because he is never Donald Blake. Not sure how the title being Thor affirms it being in the MCU any more or less but no shit it is... you are just having some trouble comprehending what I was saying thats ok.
marvelstudios,3dyeth,ILikeBisonMeat,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:05:35 2015 UTC,"The Movie is called Thor, the character is Thor. Since it is a movie containing a Marvel Comics character, it is in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).   I'm only explaining it because it seems you have not seen the movie. The entire plot is related to Thor having his powers stripped and learning to live life as a human on earth. In fact, he is Donald Blake (briefly) when he wears a fake ID badge Jane gives him (but that's not the point, it's an easter egg).   But just because it doesn't happen literally the same as in the comics (Transforming with a magic staff and all) doesn't mean it didn't happen in the MCU."
marvelstudios,3dyeth,Super_Pan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:15:21 2015 UTC,"Powers stripped = Asgardian without powers not human.   Not every marvel movie is in the mcu.

marvelstudios,3dyeth,dayungbenny,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:29:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, every movie produced by Marvel Studios is in the MCU. Are you really going to be that pedantic?  It would appear that you are, which brings me to the next point. What, exactly, is the difference between a normal human, and an Asgardian who has had all of their Asgardian-ness stripped away by Odins magic (don't even start on the magic = technology pedantry, I know you have it in you).  If he walks like a human, has human strength and all the attributes and properties of a human, what difference does it make if you call him Human or Asgardian-in-name-only. The character arc is about him being made human, it's from the comics and adapted to a movie. Do you need an actual scene in the movie where a team of doctors definitively define him as 100% human before you'll accept the plot arc, or what is your issue here?"
marvelstudios,3dyeth,Super_Pan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:35:35 2015 UTC,No need to be so condescending man. We're all fans of marvel there's no reason for us to start fighting about semantics.

marvelstudios,3dyeth,jmoney777,0,Mon Jul 20 20:53:11 2015 UTC,"If they are a completely different DNA structure then just because he doesn't have his powers does not mean he suddenly is a human. If you make a bird not able to fly, its not a human. They are 2 different species regardless of cosmetic appearance.   Yes, I am being that pedantic because you were trying to call me out and specifically said any movie with a marvel character is MCU. If someone doesn't understand where MCU continuity started you would be confusing the shit out of them with misinformation."
marvelstudios,3dyeth,Super_Pan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:43:34 2015 UTC,"So, you're saying that Yes, you do require a team of doctors to analyze Thor's DNA and declare him human before you'll accept the story point. Odin's magic turning him into a human is not good enough for you.  Geez, some people..."

I can easily see Hemsworth playing Thor for a long time though, just think how badass it would be to see a 50-year old Chris Hemsworth playing the God of Thunder, but my question is how they will address the character's age in regards to the actor's age."

Not having a human counter part to Thor makes him an, IMO, even more boring Superman. Not that Superman is boring but he just can practically never be beaten and has some of the greatest powers in the universe. If there's no Clark Kent, it'd get pretty bland after a while."
marvelstudios,3dyeth,Mr_McChicken_420,2,Mon Jul 20 22:10:33 2015 UTC,Thor is not that powerful when you put him in the cosmic marvel context.
marvelstudios,3dyeth,warriors3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:51:08 2015 UTC,"He's still pretty powerful. He is basically marvel's answer to Superman and went toe-to-toe with the Hulk a few times. Even on a cosmic scale, I'd still say he's fairly powerful, as well as the Hulk, depending on his anger of course."
marvelstudios,3dyeth,Desecr8or,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:54:33 2015 UTC,"Thor is more similar to Wonder Woman. Not Superman.  Hyperion, Sentry, Gladiator and Blue Marvel are more Superman like characters.   Thor is in the lower end of cosmic powered beings. On the same level as Beta Ray Bill. Characters like Doctor Strange, Silver Surfer, Gladiator, Thanos, Genis Vell, Galactus, Celestials are far more powerful."
marvelstudios,3dyeth,brasco975,2,Tue Jul 21 11:33:14 2015 UTC,"IMO, Thor could hurt these guys pretty bad. He might still lose in the end, but he'd do pretty well. But that's up to the writers (When Sentry pretty much beat Hulk all by himself, I thought that was pretty dumb. I mean, this is Hulk at the absolute peak of his power. Offtopic.)  Generally though, I feel you're right. The huge ""World-eater"" beings are usually ridiculously powerful. But really, the power of heroes really just depends on the writers most of the time. And what won't upset kids who think their Iron Man action figure should beat that other kid's Thor action figure. That's why, whenever Stan Lee would have two heroes fight each other, he'd always end it in a draw."

So if you work it backwards (because people in the MCU know about Thor from Norse Mythology) your maths is a bit off.  Also Thor appears to look 5-10 years younger in 800 A.D (Source Thor The God Butcher) then he does as a current avenger, if you get a chance pick it up; it is fantastic."
marvelstudios,3dyeth,oblivious247,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:31:47 2015 UTC,Shouldn't Thor have been 'Thor' 1000 years ago? He was the inspiration for Thor in the Viking age. He would have to have had a full on beard and everything at that time.
marvelstudios,3dyeth,TheQQQQ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:07:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the movie timeline doesn't match up with the mythology all that well. Thor is a bit older than Loki, who was found as a baby in 946 AD. At most Thor would have been a toddler at that time. Unless he was gifted the hammer at a very young age, the math just doesn't work out."

Remember, Hank was dissing the Avengers for what happened in Sokovia. So it kinda makes sense for him to want the Registration Act because it regulates those kinds of events. Though I might be overthinking it"
marvelstudios,3dz3gp,aveaou,3,Tue Jul 21 05:01:08 2015 UTC,"Remember how Hank didn't like Tony's father, and how he said he wouldn't ""hand-deliver"" the suit to another Stark? I think that'll play heavily on their decision to not join Stark."

At the same time though, I think he probably knows that SHIELD put together the Avengers in the first place and that SHIELD was infiltrated by HYDRA.

It would be so cool to see the Defenders be Cap's secret Avengers Like have Cap have more members but Iron Man have more power."
marvelstudios,3dz3gp,Reaility,9,Mon Jul 20 18:53:37 2015 UTC,"All we can really say about the sides right now is that War Machine will be with Tony, Falcon and Antman will be with Steve, and Thor and Hulk are both not involved. Hawkeye, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Vision, and Black Panther are all confirmed for the movie but could go either way. In the comics Spiderman starts on Tony's side and his swap to Steve's side is a major turning point. We have no mention of any Daredevil characters on the cast list, or maybe more notably, no Nick Fury or Maria Hill. It would be interesting to see where the SHIELD characters fall in all this now that SHIELD is much smaller and independent of the US government."
marvelstudios,3dz3gp,EpicureanHorn,3,Mon Jul 20 23:12:52 2015 UTC,"Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Scarlet Witch will probably be on Cap's side. Not sure about Vision. Black Panther will probably be neutral."

The story was more personal and character related than some of the other movies, and the ""geeky"" elements were almost non-existent (no robot armies, no aliens, no magic, etc).  It had a like-able lead with a compelling and relateable motivation (he just wanted to see his daughter).  On top of that, it was one of the funniest marvel movies yet, along with probably the most interesting and creative action scenes yet.  I know the opening weekend was a little short of what they had hoped, but I think word of mouth will really help this film over the next few weeks.

I am assuming you are male? I am too, but I have had this discussion with my SO numerous times, so I can reiterate her position with some confidence, which is that better representation is needed in superhero media in general.    Also try to understand that if we had seen a leading female superhero back in 2002, there wouldn't have been much support (which is why there were none).   Just to note, I am not talking about superhero movies in general, I am speaking specifically with regards to this new era of cinematic universes. Catwoman was released in '04, Elektra in '05. They were both bad, and both have rightfully been consigned to cinematic oblivion. Superhero film adaptations based on comics have existed since the mid-20th century, and with a couple of notable exceptions (Donner's Superman, the X-Men franchise, Blade) were largely ignored by anyone other than die-hard fans. We saw a few female superheroes here and there, and they received the same lackluster treatment as their male counterparts. Iron Man basically ushered in a superhero renaissance, and heralded superhero movies as something that the studios and critics were forced to take seriously.  Right now 100% of MCU movies that have been released were headlined by a white dude. Yes, there is history in Marvel where their best-known heroes are all white dudes, but part of being a socially conscious entity (which Marvel claims to be) is updating your formula to reflect the world in which we exist. Does anyone actually believe that if, after coming off of the Avengers, Marvel had announced a female superhero, people would not have been supportive? If they had announced that Black Panther and Captain Marvel would be widening the scope of the world, and the we would see Black Widow going on espionage missions too delicate for the Avengers, that people would not have eaten it up?   Now in 2015, we see the need for a female hero to break the status quo. I understand some people's frustration but what I don't understand is their impatience.    A LOT of people watch Marvel movies. Some of them would like to see themselves as the hero for once. The impatience is because people in marginalized positions have always been told to 'wait their turn.' When the people in charge decree that it is time, the change will come. It makes people feel like they don't matter and will be thrown a bone when the important stuff is done with. Hence the impatience."
marvelstudios,3dys9e,74three1989,6,Tue Jul 21 16:05:53 2015 UTC,"None of them were excited for it at all but they do see just about every superhero movie that comes out. Typical 20 something guys, will watch just about anything blockbuster-ish.   General consensus was 6/10, middle of the pack for the MCU movies they'd seen. They loved the humour but didn't give a shit about the ant montage and thought that ant stuff was stupid. They aren't comic readers so their interest in the movies comes from what they are shown in the trailer.   They aren't particularly excited for some the future movies either. The more obscure and unknown the property, the less they care. They'll see them all regardless but yeah, the trailer means a lot to normies."
marvelstudios,3dys9e,swellipop,6,Mon Jul 20 17:43:57 2015 UTC,"Wow, this thread makes me sad. Not because people loved it, but because many people thought this was gonna suck until they watched it. There must be thousands of people thinking that right now and they have no idea how wrong they are, which is affecting such a good film."
marvelstudios,3dys9e,_Valisk,4,Mon Jul 20 20:04:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree.  I hope that the word of mouth will help with that though.  It might give ant-Man a better hold up than it could have had."
marvelstudios,3dys9e,Jazzimusprime,6,Mon Jul 20 20:24:08 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people seem to think that something called ""Ant-Man"" is any sillier than ""Spider-Man"" or ""Iron Man"" or ""Batman."" Why does Ant-Man's name cause so much ridicule when Spider-Man is just as silly?"
marvelstudios,3dys9e,PlatFleece,4,Mon Jul 20 21:37:26 2015 UTC,Ant is an inherently funny word. Also spiders and bats are probably more frightening compared to ants. And iron just sounds cool. At least that's my take on it.
marvelstudios,3dys9e,Elementium,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:51:51 2015 UTC,"My guess is that even if they bought the name, it's the powerset. Saying it out loud it kinda sounds silly if your powers consist of ""Shrinking and controlling ants"" even if you add the superpowered punches to the side.  Also it's always better to show than tell. Unless they see how shrinking powers can be useful it pretty much is hard to sell by just telling it."

Most of the people I know who casually enjoy super hero movies didn't bother to see it (see: the box office results) so I'm trying to convince them it's a worthwhile trip. Mostly by telling them it's really funny, and that it has ""the same writer as Anchorman and Step Brothers"", which I think is working?"

I think paul rudd is an excellent choice to be a future avenger. He just so different for all our other heroes in the mcu, the way he can not take himself so seriously will bring a breath of fresh air to the new movies that will balance out the team chemistry well.

She says she liked that Scott's story was very personal, liked his in-suit scenes way more than she expected to, and thought Luis was ""almost as funny as the raccoon""."

marvelstudios,3dyh2h,your_mind_aches,11,Mon Jul 20 19:10:51 2015 UTC,I'm just worried that with each film Marvel grows the big picture by more and more. As a fan that is exciting but potential directors will only see that as more and more cumbersome as the MCU goes forward.  It may start getting harder to attract stellar directors and have to settle for the usual suspects of Hollywood.
marvelstudios,3dyh2h,The_Abjectator,5,Mon Jul 20 21:53:51 2015 UTC,"I actually kind of like it like this.  There is a firm hand that will take anyone ""good enough"" and make sure that the minimum done is as good as what came before and makes sense.  This is what happens when you try to make a shared Universe, the movies have to work together.  Boohoo if we don't the director that only wants to add to their own name and fame, we get a tapestry of film instead of some good looking selfies."
marvelstudios,3dyh2h,Pirellan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:28:42 2015 UTC,"You're really okay with getting the same tonal value movie after movie and settling for ""good enough""? That seems pretty sad to me. I would love to see the next Fincher or Tarantino's view of the MCU. It'd be a shame if we never get that if Marvel isn't willing to allow a looser hold on the story. You know as long as the director doesn't want to drastically change the motivations and personality of the hero and their abilities."
marvelstudios,3dyh2h,allthebacon,2,Tue Jul 21 08:21:10 2015 UTC,I feel a huge slate clearing at the end of Phase Three coming. And the continuity might be loosened a bit so that new directors would have more freedom to work.
marvelstudios,3dyh2h,SutterCane,2,Tue Jul 21 01:59:00 2015 UTC,At this point the director of a Marvel movie is more like the director of an individual episode of a TV show.   That doesn't bother me at all but some people see it as a problem.
marvelstudios,3dyh2h,Baelorn,2,Tue Jul 21 05:16:48 2015 UTC,"I'm glad, for that reason, that the Russo brothers are directing as many movies as they are in Phase 3; I'm sure if, like, David Lynch could come in and do whatever he wants with an MCU movie, I'd love the result, but since Marvel Studios is going for a television-esque approach, having directors with lots of television experience who understand the television direction process is really valuable. I'm sure any individual MCU film could have more artistic merit in the hands of an auteur, but Marvel Studios is clearly more interested in the artistic merit of the franchise as a whole than any individual part, which really seems like the right choice, given that they're basically working in a medium that didn't really exist before."
marvelstudios,3dyh2h,segoli,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:50:55 2015 UTC,Thats one of the things I love about the Marvel movies. That they all seem to fit together in an overall universe. When it comes to comic book movies Id much rather have that than giving big name director total control and just having standalone movies.
marvelstudios,3dyh2h,TripleSkeet,5,Tue Jul 21 05:31:00 2015 UTC,"That's a completely understandable reason. I figured as much that the main draw of Marvel was its ability to reach a wide audience. The important thing is that both parties were honest with each other, even if it doesn't work out in the end. Don't want a repeat of Thor 2 or Iron Man 2."

The most obvious being the X-men originally meant to portray prejudice, but that couldn't survive the toll of the changing of the times and the fact that the normal humans don't behave realistically.

marvelstudios,3dz50e,thoughts-from-alex,24,Mon Jul 20 18:35:13 2015 UTC,"It would feel a bit weird (at least for main villains), considering the amount of characters in the Marvel lore, to go for totally new ones, when you already have plenty at your disposal that you can incorporate, even if they're modified versions for the MCU."
marvelstudios,3dz50e,Faskil,9,Mon Jul 20 18:39:23 2015 UTC,"Most of the movie villains are only tangentially related to their comic book counterparts (especially Alexander Pierce and Aldritch Killian; Loki is the main counterexample). I think we're more likely to see continued reinvention of characters which Marvel already owns the rights to rather than the creation of more original characters. The only OCs so far in the MCU are the casts of Agents of SHIELD and parts of the Agent Carter cast, which is probably because it's easier for the shows to just create original characters than to try to work around whatever Marvel Studios is using."
marvelstudios,3dz50e,jbernier93,5,Mon Jul 20 19:00:55 2015 UTC,Try this and this.  If is a main villain than at least name him after an existing character from the comics.
marvelstudios,3dz50e,Shadow_Gabriel,4,Mon Jul 20 18:42:24 2015 UTC,"Doesn't naming them after an existing character potentially invalidate the possibility of using the existing character again later on?  I feel like people would be more annoyed about an entirely new character being simply named after a comics character. Like... Would you rather than Spider-Man fight a shapeshifting alien scientist called Dave, or one called Kraven? Neither of them are actually Kraven the Hunter, but one of them shares the name.   (I'm not, by the way, saying Spider-Man should fight a shape shifting alien scientist called Dave. That's more of a Thor villain.)"
marvelstudios,3dz50e,Shadow_Gabriel,6,Mon Jul 20 18:46:47 2015 UTC,Kraven is a big and popular villain.   I don't think anyone know who Killian and Cross were before the movie.
marvelstudios,3dz50e,Shadow_Gabriel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:54:58 2015 UTC,"It was just the first name that came to mind, really, but I see your point.  Would it have mattered if Killian or Cross had different names?"
marvelstudios,3dz50e,borgsaa,2,Mon Jul 20 19:05:12 2015 UTC,A totally original character would be awkward for a main villain. I can see doing it on Agents of Shield (Jiaying) but not for the movies.   Maybe it doesn't matter for many people but it matters for me.
marvelstudios,3dz50e,TARDISd,3,Mon Jul 20 19:13:50 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be a fan of it. Even without the Fox villains they have a huge catalogue to choose from. I also think they proved that they can elevate characters from the comics that just kinda suck, when they introduced their version of Wesley."
marvelstudios,3dz50e,AlleyOopToym,2,Mon Jul 20 20:32:52 2015 UTC,"Baron Mordo is supposedly going to be an amalgamation of several Strange villains, so you could kinda consider that an original creation, although obviously we don't know how that's going to go yet.   Personally, I'd kinda prefer they stick to main villains that are at least somewhat representative of characters from the comics. We've seen versions of guys like Batroc, Faustian, and Arnim Zola that maybe aren't 100% accurate to the comics, but they work in the context of the MCU. That said, I do like some of what Agents of SHIELD has done with some of the new Inhumans and other villain-types. If done well, I guess I'd be open to it, but it can also be a slippery slope. Ultimately, I think it comes down to the comic book fans' desire to see our favorite characters brought to life rather than something ""made up"", vs the general public just wanting whatever looks cool."
marvelstudios,3dz50e,Worthyness,2,Mon Jul 20 20:00:54 2015 UTC,Somewhat. At least the name should come from a character who existed in the comics.
marvelstudios,3dz50e,LochNessMonocle,2,Mon Jul 20 20:13:42 2015 UTC,"The reason a lot of fans are excited is because the movies are using their rich history for the characters and not original ones. They can be creative on the comics and TV show fronts, but the movies should have familiar characters even if only by name."
marvelstudios,3dz50e,ChrisGT122,2,Mon Jul 20 22:43:28 2015 UTC,No way.
marvelstudios,3dz50e,UNITBlackArchive,3,Tue Jul 21 00:42:23 2015 UTC,"If done right, then I'm down for it. A good example is how in Batman The Animated Series they created a new villain in the form of Harley Quinn."

marvelstudios,3e0krn,FPSGamer48,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:02:06 2015 UTC,"I just sort of have a general idea of what I'd like to see in a spider-woman story. I'd like to see a spider-woman story that briefly touches upon Jessica's origins through flashbacks with her father and her hydra life, but mainly focuses on the spider-woman: agent of sword story arc where she is recruited by Abigail brand to work for SWORD. It wouldn't follow that arc directly though, because it heavily involves the skrulls and I don't see MCU getting into skrulls or secret invasion due to the restrictions on those rights. So basically she would be hunting an invading alien race that has secretly infiltrated our society somehow, and things from her hydra past come back to bite her/lure her back."
marvelstudios,3e0krn,stormz96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:03:18 2015 UTC,"Oh....well Phase 5 for me may or may not be Secret Invasion....theoretically they could do it. They simply don't have Super Skrulls, but they can use Skrulls. All Skrulls can shapeshift, they simply don't have ones that can mimic powers. My idea for a Spider-Woman movie would be like this: Spider-Woman, working for SWORD, discovers a ship of Skrulls, whom she fights throughout the entire movie, only to end up being captured and impersonated by the Skrull. Sets up Secret Invasion, and allows Jessica to return in Avengers: Secret Invasion, so she can join the Avengers post-Secret Invasion. BOOM! What do you think?  See that one I kind of have set up, it's mainly Tigra that I'm having trouble planning. I know almost nothing of her but plan on doing a West Coast Avengers meaning she has to be introduced somehow."
marvelstudios,3e0krn,stormz96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:35:01 2015 UTC,"I really dig that! I never though of adapting her sword story prior to the secret invasion and capturing but that's a great way to lead into a secret invasion film. And for tigra, I think she's better introduced in another film rather than giving her one. Here's an idea though, She dated a skrull posing as hank Pym in secret invasion and had its baby. Maybe this happens in the mcu replacing hank Pym with someone else and she starts hunting skrulls for sword as revenge, and so we meet her in spider-woman! She could be like the widow to Jessica's Cap."
marvelstudios,3e0krn,2chainzrules24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:03:09 2015 UTC,"Oh!!!! Great idea! Will consider it! My current idea is she gets a Solo film that involves her being hunted by Kraven the Hunter, requiring Spider-Man to come assist her, only for the 2 to be captured and forced to fight in an arena (based on another comic book). Tigra eventually breaks Spider-Man free of Kraven's control and the 2 fight. The after credit scene is Vision recruiting Tigra for the West Coast Avengers, then the 2nd one involves Kraven on the African coast encountering Namor leaving the water, setting up the following film, Black Panther: Dark Waters Rising, which is Namor vs Black Panther."

Assuming that Thanos and Infinity War have some sort of cosmic impact in the MCU, I could definitely see them moving away with the current version of the Nova Corps and toward incorporating the ""Nova Force"" in a hypothetical Phase 4.

marvelstudios,3dyya8,Data_Error,2,Mon Jul 20 21:23:08 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit worried how they would handle Old Lace if it was a series. I mean, they didn't add Avengers tower into Daredevil because it was too expensive to CGI it in every shot of the skyline. How are they gonna handle the dinosaur, Chase's fistigons, Karolina glowing and FLYING and Nico using magic?  Id take a series over a movie, but they would need a movie-sized budget to do it justice."
marvelstudios,3dyya8,wendytheroo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:48:21 2015 UTC,"While the Fistigons could be done pretty reasonably, there's also Victor's electromagnetism, pretty much everything about Xavin, and Klara if the series makes it that far. Oh, and their frog-mobile, if they really wanted to be weird.  Considering all of the special-effect-wielding characters they've been adding to AoS (and Netflix's deep pockets in the scenario that they buy in), I feel like most of that could be done, especially since the Runaways carry a lot more focus on character conflict than they do on exercising their powers. Good CGI is getting cheaper and cheaper all the time - by the time Infinity War hits, this could may be less of a problem.  Old Lace is definitely a constant problem, though. I suppose they could reserve CG for close-up/action shots and do animatronics/puppets/keep her offscreen otherwise."
marvelstudios,3dyya8,Data_Error,4,Mon Jul 20 23:44:13 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see Taskmaster in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. as Ward's hired gun.

But to answer your question I would like to see the inevitable Hope Van Dyne as Wasp, Moon Knight, Namor, and the reintroduction of Blade and Ghost Rider.

They'd dismiss her as many laypeople dismissed Guardians and Ant-Man (initially). They'd see a she's conveniently Banner's cousin who just so happened to have needed a blood transfusion of all things. They'd see a courtroom drama but not without a big green elephant in the room. Sure that's ""part of the fun"" but I honestly don't see it translating to film very well at all."

The Marvel Universe is chock full of great originals that can be brought into the main stream. Just look at the Phase 3 lineup! If you would have told me twenty years ago that Groot and Ant-Man and Doctor Strange would become household names I would have just laughed at you. That being said, Ant-Man and the Guardians are their own characters. Sure we saw a passing of the torch in Ant-Man, but at least the shift was believable. The suit was handed from one capable man to his mentee and another one passed to his daughter.  The likes of She Hulk and Beta Ray Bill being conveniently granted power by their predecessors is farther fetched than what has been shown before. And I stand by my argument. They won't translate into film very well."

I don't know, I guess I don't really think of She-Hulk as a legacy.  In name, yes, and in skin color, but that's about it.  She doesn't really depend on the Hulk to do anything but give her an origin that doesn't require yet another hero being exposed to radiation and living through it.  She's very much her own character with a unique niche and storytelling tone (and it happens to be a tone that fits perfectly with how the MCU usually is already).  That's something I'd really like to see translated."

I'm still hoping AoS introduces her at some point as she has a lot of connections with SHIELD/Hydra in the comics.   Moon Knight would be amazing. I'd love to have a Netflix series dealing with Marc Spector's struggle to control the different aspects of Khonshu as Moon Knight.  I'd also love to see Ms. Marvel at some point even though she's a relatively new character. Maybe she could show up in the inhumans movie and be the protagonist in it as a way of being able to showcase to the general audience what the inhumans are all about  Cloak and Dagger don't get much love anymore. Maybe having a show would help boost their popularity as I think they're two of the most interesting characters that not a lot of people know about.  Nova absolutely NEEDS to be in the MCU at some point and it has to be Richard Rider. Maybe once Thanos comes after the power gem, he'll destroy Xandar, leaving only Richie to take on the mantle as the last surviving Nova Corp in the galaxy.  Phyla-Vell as Quasar would be cool as fuck and I'm hoping GotG 2 is going to feature her as the new member of the team. Plus, it opens up the possibility of Mar-Vell being in Captain Marvel."

I think Snyder is a terrific visual director, so if he has a good enough screenplay I think it'll be awesome.

I agree with you about Snyder being a good visual director, but nothing I've seen from him has proven that he offers more beyond that.

Suicide Squad is a little strange at first glance, but if you throw enough interesting things in together (Will Smith in an ensemble, Jared Leto as the Joker, Harley Quinn, David Ayers) you may have something that works. Plus at a supposedly lower budget, it's less risky.   DC's real test will come with how they do with non Big Two characters Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Flash. If DC can get those characters to work, they will be very interesting.   Marvel's test will be how they do with Doctor Strange and GotG. Ant-Man's obscurity has been suggested to cause a lower box office, and Doctor Strange is the first film that really leads to their B-list characters Black Panther and Captain Marvel. With a first weekend in May opening, a lot of pressure will be on that movie to open huge. GotG 2 being able to replicate or exceed it's original performance means that it would have a better track record than the Avengers."

If they're good and they resonate with audiences, I think Marvel will dip into some experimentation.  If they're just decent or worse, Marvel will see it as vindication for the way they do things."
marvelstudios,3e18xa,Zeno84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:21:36 2015 UTC,The competition will definitely keep both franchises on their toes. Everyone will benefit

I love fights in the sky, and I'm hoping Captain Marvel turns out to be a really good movie with memorable fight scenes."
marvelstudios,3e18ia,ace22nd,3,Tue Jul 21 04:32:13 2015 UTC,"Probably a mix of that, plus what we saw, again, in the suitcase fight, mainly since it was a battle between two equal power sets, which I;m assuming is what's gonna happen in Captain Marvel."
marvelstudios,3e18ia,ace22nd,2,Tue Jul 21 04:36:18 2015 UTC,"Do you mind giving me a quick rundown of her powers? I'm not too fimiliar with the character (only knowing bits and pieces like her military background and her relationship with Rhodey), and that's one of the main reasons why it's one of my most anticipated for Phase 3. I love seeing new characters!"

marvelstudios,3e0gp1,woofle07,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:39:48 2015 UTC,I think it was just filler. There was another headline about the drought in California that didn't have anything to do with the MCU. It was most likely put there to make the world feel more real rather than just having everything revolve around the Avengers.
marvelstudios,3e0gp1,broganisms,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:40 2015 UTC,There's a deleted scene where Scott tries to rig the lottery to pay off child support but fails. It could have been setting that up.
marvelstudios,3dy7jg,GnarlsD,8,Mon Jul 20 14:37:26 2015 UTC,I saw it in IMAX 3D and it was actually great (whereas Age of Ultron was honestly hard to watch). However in terms of just regular 3D it's probably not worth it.
marvelstudios,3dy7jg,HighTreazon,3,Mon Jul 20 15:02:55 2015 UTC,"I saw it in IMAX 3D for timing reasons. I actually thought it was kind of a waste. It was fine, and I didn't feel like it was made worse by 3D, but better...? Not really."

I usually dislike 3D and choose 2D as often as my friends allow. A bad 3D movie you definitely notice, like it feels gimmicky or forced but this was fine.   That could also be interpreted as an easy way to save 4 bucks or whatever I suppose. There wasn't any times where I thought oh wow that was a cool way to use 3D"

marvelstudios,3dy7jg,Boyah875,3,Mon Jul 20 16:00:06 2015 UTC,There are scenes towards the end that you will not see in any other movie. See it in 3d at least once before it is gone.
marvelstudios,3dy7jg,mithhunter55,2,Mon Jul 20 17:27:42 2015 UTC,"I normally don't like 3D because I wear glasses, but the earliest showing on Thursday night was 3D only, so I just did it.  That being said, there's one scene in particular that was done really well and looked fantastic in 3D. I don't think you should pay a few bucks extra just to get the one scene, but if you already like watching in 3D then definitely do it."

marvelstudios,3dy7jg,blackwhitetiger,2,Tue Jul 21 04:48:59 2015 UTC,I saw it in 2D and 3D and I dind't think there was anything really all that great about the 3D version to warrant the increase in price.  The 3D is well done and you can really notice it with the characters standing out but I don't think you'll have an appreciable difference in seeing either version.

Barely had a line at all. Kinda sad since I really enjoyed this movie.
marvelstudios,3dujob,SpudzMakenzy,14,Sun Jul 19 20:40:55 2015 UTC,"We went to see it in IMAX3D (LieMAX) in Albuquerque and the schedule was all messed up.  We walked into the theater 30 minutes before show time and the credits were rolling for the previous showing.  We walked out and asked and they directed us to start a line by the wall.  The line was 100+ for AOU and by the time they let us in, there were maybe 10 in line.  The theater ended up being mostly empty with maybe 30 people.  TONS of People were passing by us to the screen that was showing Minions.  (They all had kids with them)  The manager asked us afterwords if we liked it and wondered if we had any idea why it had being doing so poorly.  Didn't have an answer for him."

marvelstudios,3dw007,akong_supern00b,101,Mon Jul 20 15:42:27 2015 UTC,Here's my thing: Tony doesn't need to defeat his enemies. He simply outsmarts them and lets things play out. The armor is more of a shield than a sword.
marvelstudios,3dw007,FPSGamer48,83,Tue Jul 21 05:42:08 2015 UTC,"The armor is more of a shield than a sword.   This is why he's the perfect parallel to Cap. Tony's armor is his shield, and his mind (body) is his sword. Cap's shield is his literal shield, but his body (mind) is his sword.   It's just that their beliefs are what conflicts the two."
marvelstudios,3dw007,FuckMeRunning5648,51,Mon Jul 20 00:27:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And their beliefs portray the 20th and 21st century. The 20th century boy of war, and the 21st century futurist.

In Iron Man 1 he got Stane into a position where he could be taken out, he's the one who instructed Pepper to overload the coil, would you say a general isn't resposible for the deaths of the opposition because he didn't physically kill them himself? He still gave the order.  In Iron Man 2 Tony and Rhodey kicked the shit out of Venko which is when he blew himself up. He did that because he was beaten and there was no way out, he was defeated. Just because he ended his own life doesn't mean he wasn't defeated beforehand."

In most cases, a 2-part movie is simply a cash grab, but I really see an importance in having 2 movies for the Infinity War. It gives them room to really display the true threat that is Thanos.  With the huge ensemble of characters in these movies, it can help give each of them fair screen time and allow for overall better pacing of the movies.  It also gives an opportunity for Marvel to go several ways with this battle. Thanos could win the first battle for the first movie or he could lose, retreat, and strike again for the second movie. Personally, I'm mostly glad they are separating the Infinity War into 2 movies for the pacing.  I think it'll help reduce forced interactions with all the heroes and will give the characters their own moments to shine. I forsee more of a focus on the original Avengers cast for the first movie and then more of a focus on the New Avengers in the second movie."

When he shrinks he compresses his size and density but increases his strength, when he grows obviously he would be weak because he's stretching the distance between his molecules so he compensates by pulling in matter from an extra-dimensional source to fill in the empty spaces as he grows.

If the force from his fist as a full grown human would cause the person to ""go flying"" (or at least have their feet leave the ground) then the small ant sized version would as well (perhaps a little bit less).  F=ma, so if the force is the same, the acceleration should be the same, regardless of the pressure.  The additional pressure will cause piercing, as well as cause people to go ""flying"".

F=m*a p=F/A   where   F = force m = mass a = acceleration A = area p = pressure   His mass is constant (or not, is a movie). The area of his fist is very small. So the pressure can change more drastically when you change the acceleration. That's why it was necessary for him to learn to control his punching speed."

marvelstudios,3dx9xx,ThunderZuk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:05:57 2015 UTC,If he goes small because he shrinks the distances between the atoms than he should have the same mass. And if he does not have the same mass than his punches should feel like dust particles.  Is a movie.
marvelstudios,3dx9xx,Shadow_Gabriel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:08:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get that... I'm just guessing it wasn't really figured out. I'm in it for good fun and take it at movie value too. I was curious if there was an official ""scientific"" explanation, though. Wikipedia explains it as shunting mass to another dimension. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Pym"
marvelstudios,3dx9xx,ThunderZuk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:16:11 2015 UTC,You bring up a good point because the first time he shrinks he cracks floor tile and goes through floors. Poor ants.
marvelstudios,3dx9xx,Spideyjarod,2,Mon Jul 20 12:18:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's just not very consistent, unless there is an explanation we don't know. When he runs up the man's gun, the man has no problem holding it. If he only has his regular strength and not the same mass, though, a jump punch wouldn't have enough force behind it to knock that same guy over. They probably use whichever portion is convenient in the situation."
marvelstudios,3dx9xx,ThunderZuk,2,Mon Jul 20 12:43:30 2015 UTC,"It's like a bowling ball. You can pick it up, walk around, swing it, etc. Without too much trouble, but if it's dropped on your head from a considerable height, its going to do some damage. Also, mass =/= weight. He weighs much less when he's smaller, but he has the same amount of atoms in his body. A peanut to us weighs nothing, but to something the size of an ant, it would weigh a ton. Plus, ants can lift several times their body weight, so holding Scott would not be any trouble at all."

marvelstudios,3e0xa5,thezemnot,13,Tue Jul 21 02:44:32 2015 UTC,"Ultron was the evil accidental child of Tony and Bruce's scientific tinkering and the consciousness of the mind stone. It has been confirmed time and time again that in the MCU, Hank Pym has no ties to Ultron."
marvelstudios,3e0xa5,HoennBorn,-9,Tue Jul 21 02:46:51 2015 UTC,"He had to come from somewhere other than halfway programming software and letting it go idle while the Avengers get drunk and attempt to lift Mjolnir. While it doesn't HAVE to be Hank Pym, I assume there must be another source as to his true creator."
marvelstudios,3e0xa5,SToddB33,8,Tue Jul 21 02:55:03 2015 UTC,The A.I. was already partially there and they talk about how the scepter could be the missing link to creating Ultron. Then they science it up for a few days in the montage and finally one of the trials connects and the Mind Stone takes Ultron to a whole new level beyond what Tony and Bruce intended.   Ultron has a creator. Tony did the programming for Ultron but they were just missing one ingredient and the energy the scepter gave off let Tony know it was what he needed. Thus Tony is the creator.
marvelstudios,3e0xa5,Fripples,5,Tue Jul 21 02:58:54 2015 UTC,he had to come from somewhere   You're looking for a deeper explanation where none was intended.  Listen to what people here are saying.  It's not that complicated.
marvelstudios,3e0xa5,HoennBorn,4,Tue Jul 21 04:26:29 2015 UTC,"Between the Avengers 1 and AoU, Tony and Bruce have been developing a peacekeeping Artificial Intelligence program to police the world so the Avengers didn't have to.  They were stuck in production and were missing a crucial part of the program that would help achieve true consciousness. That's where the mind stone comes in. The mind stone, being a nigh omnipotent celestial artifact, in and of itself is--or can create--consciousness (i.e. Ultron, Vision, etc.). Tony and Bruce harness this and implement it within the AI program they've already developed by running every possible combination and permutation to interface the mind stone element with their program.   What more are you asking for? It's the power of the mind stone. As we can see, the Vision would be what the mind stone is capable of creating when untainted by Tony and Bruce's touch. The consciousness is pure."
marvelstudios,3e0xa5,CountScarlioni,7,Tue Jul 21 03:24:27 2015 UTC,"Thus, when is the MCU going to truly explain where Ultron actually originated?   In Avengers: Age of Ultron. The MCU is not the comics. Things change in adaptation."
marvelstudios,3e0xa5,SToddB33,-10,Tue Jul 21 02:55:42 2015 UTC,"Like I said...Ultron was only half built. Tony even admits that they were nowhere near ready to finish him. This means he must have come from somewhere else. Not saying it HAS to be Hank Pym, but it's logical to assume such."
marvelstudios,3e0xa5,goodbrock,8,Tue Jul 21 02:58:53 2015 UTC,No he was more like 90% built. The Mind Stone was the missing 10% to the puzzle that was Ultron.
marvelstudios,3e0xa5,Fripples,5,Tue Jul 21 03:27:38 2015 UTC,"The Mind Stone is what ""finalized"" Ultron. The other 85-90% came from the Science Bros."
marvelstudios,3e0xa5,TheBandIsRedHeaven,2,Tue Jul 21 03:41:37 2015 UTC,Pym had no involvement whatsoever in the creation of Ultron.  I thought that was clear.
marvelstudios,3e0xa5,RobertGonzales,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:09:01 2015 UTC,"I got the sense that Ulron was a perfect storm of several volatile elements. The AI that was found in the staff was pretty powerful, but it was the various tests that Banner and Stark were doing on the AI code that ultimately brought him to life (I do find it a little odd that they left all the machinery and tests running without sticking around to monitor them, but I digress). Ultron wasn't able to bust out of the scepter without those two nerds giving him a way to do it, so... I still think the blame falls on their shoulders."
marvelstudios,3e0xa5,Mamsies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:57:05 2015 UTC,"Well I guess Marvel don't really care about history, canon or continuity as long as their creators have a story to tell.   On other hand I don't see Michael Douglas play Ultron in upcoming movies either."
marvelstudios,3e0xa5,goodbrock,0,Tue Jul 21 06:47:57 2015 UTC,"Ultron was an Artificial Intelligence that Hydra found in the wreckage on New York. I was seriously hoping that Ant-Man would take place BEFORE the battle of New York (before Avengers 1) and Ultron would be Hank Pym's equivalent to JARVIS. They wouldn't have to say ""this is Ultron"" or whatever, that would make it too obvious. They should have just got the guy who voiced Ultron (god dammit I can't remember his name) to voice Hank Pym's AI."

marvelstudios,3dzkor,Spatula26,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:28:24 2015 UTC,"I don't want recasts. Rhodey and Banner were annoying enough (though I do like the newer actors better) because it takes you out. And especially now that the actors have been doing the roles for so long, it'd be even more jarring. Here's my idea:  Cap eventually is killed. Bucky takes up the shield and dresses similarly but should have a different name. Falcon should get an upgrade because as cool as he is, he keeps getting his ass kicked. And on top of that, I want Sam to become the new leader. Bucky and Rhodey (as War Machine, not Iron Man) are his two right hand men. And Iron Man should retire to a more reserved role. People have been suggesting politics, or even Director of Shield. But honestly, Maria Hill should become Director after Fury passes.  Thor should eventually return to Asgard for good, and become king. Either he brings Natalie Portman with him or he dumps her ass, I don't care, he just needs to stay and take care of his people. I know everyone says it, and it probably won't ever happen, but Hulk needs to go to space and do his Planet Hulk thang. Eventually come back to Earth, and then either finally find peace and chill forever as Banner or somehow he dies too.  Vision can stay for as long as he wants, cuz he's a goddamn android. Scarlet Witch could go crazy at some point and do some destructive reality warping shit. Ant-Man and Wasp can hang for a while, but they should eventually retire so they can stay alive and Scott can be with his daughter.  As for the rest, I don't know yet. And that's all super unrealistic but it's what I'd like to see.  EDIT: Oh! And I forgot about the Defenders! At least Power Man should join the Avengers. And if he's going he'll probably take Jessica with him. And Daredevil just isn't the Avenger type and I don't know shit about Iron Fist so....maybe!"
marvelstudios,3dzkor,kovos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:31:13 2015 UTC,"Recasts are going to happen. To think otherwise is just idiotic. The one good thing about the MCU is that they have such a connected universe with the Avengers being the tie in. Having the Avengers film gives Marvel a large area to play with and they can introduce recasts via these movies. They've already done it with the Hulk. But they could have a situation where they leave out Iron Man in Avengers 5, then bring the character back with another actor in Avengers 6. Then they are free to come out with another Iron Man movie or just have the new Iron Man actor continue on in the Avengers film."
marvelstudios,3dziy0,The_Geek_999,3,Mon Jul 20 20:15:01 2015 UTC,"Asgardians, having access to the bifrost, identified the nine planets connected by it as realms and that's what they taught their Nordic worshippers. That's not to say there's not more (which there clearly is) and the distance between them can't be traveled by other methods, it's just not known if that's ever been done. The bifrost is essentially a super galactic highway."
marvelstudios,3dziy0,diddles_giraffes,3,Mon Jul 20 21:03:28 2015 UTC,"I always envision the 9 realms as 9 different planets scattered across the Cosmos, but they have one thing in common - they are linked together by the convergence.  Expanding off of that, I think of the Bifrost as technology developed from studying the convergence and allows for easy travel between these 9 planets in space whenever the Asgardians wish.    So ultimately the 9 realms are the 9 planets that Asgard influences and everything else like Xander,Knowhere, etc... is simply not sitting on a ""convergence point"" .. which also explains why the Collector was shocked to see Asgardians so far away from home."
marvelstudios,3dziy0,DaBest13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:28:24 2015 UTC,"There are 9 realms right?   Yes.   Are the guardians in the same Realm as Earth, so in other words, are the planets and places from GotG a part of Midgard?  And what about the Kree? They are in the same Realm as the Guardians right?   Midgard is Earth. It seems - seems, though it is not 100% clear - that the Nine Realms in the MCU are just a group of eight planets and whatever the heck Asgard is that are connected by a wormhole network (the Bifrost). So Earth itself is one ""realm,"" Asgard is another, as is Jotunheim and the Dark Elves' planet, and then five more. Planets like Xandar and Hala are not linked by the Bifrost, and as such are not considered ""realms.""   could the Guardians or the Kree get to Earth without using the bifrost or the Tesseract?   Yes, just as humans could hypothetically leave via spaceship. For example, Yondu came to Earth to retrieve Peter Quill in a standard spacecraft."
marvelstudios,3dziy0,CountScarlioni,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, I think I get it. So not every planet is a realm. You just have the nine realms, all connected by the Bifrost, and then basically everything else, just somewhere in the same universe. Is a connection to the Bifrost the only criterium to be seen as a realm? And is the Kree-planet a realm?  Thank you for your answers so far, good sir."
marvelstudios,3dziy0,CountScarlioni,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:48:58 2015 UTC,"So not every planet is a realm. You just have the nine realms, all connected by the Bifrost, and then basically everything else, just somewhere in the same universe.   That's the basic idea, yeah.   Is a connection to the Bifrost the only criterium to be seen as a realm?   As far as we have seen. ""The Nine Realms"" seem to be a mostly-Asgardian concept, and the Asgardians control the Bifrost. So the terminology is really only useful to them, as it connotes which other worlds are connected via the bridge. So for instance, if you had a group of six towns that were all connected by a single road, you might refer to that specific subset of towns using a specific term, even though other towns and cities exist elsewhere.   And is the Kree-planet a realm?   The Kree homeworld is Hala, as mentioned in Agents of SHIELD. It is not one of the Nine Realms, although we have seen that the Asgardians can travel to other parts of the universe (just not via the Bifrost; I assume that they have developed spacecraft of some kind).  EDIT: The Nine Realms consist of these worlds:   Asgard Midgard (Earth) Jotunheim (Frost Giants' homeworld) Svartalfheim (Dark Elves' homeworld) Vanaheim (Vanir's homeworld - this is where Hogun of the Warriors Three comes from; I had forgotten that we saw it at the beginning of Thor: The Dark World) Muspelheim Alfheim Nidavellir Helheim"
marvelstudios,3dziy0,Jarnin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:10:51 2015 UTC,"The term ""realm"" seems to be giving you some problems; a ""realm"" is nothing more than a location separated by something from another location.  It all boils down to Asgardian use of Shakespearean English. The writers use the word ""realm"" because it sounds a bit cooler to hear Thor say ""realm"" rather than ""planet"".  A connection to the Bifrost means that it is part of the nine realms.  Kree territory would probably be considered a ""realm"" by Asgardians, but not part of the nine connected to Bifrost and ruled over (or protected by) Asgardians. Of course Kree territory and Xandar seem to be located in M31, the Andromeda galaxy, which is the closest large galaxy to our own Milky Way galaxy."
marvelstudios,3dziy0,Shadow_Gabriel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:28:55 2015 UTC,"The 9 realms are 9 planets in the same dimension and most probably in the same galaxy and probably in the same vicinity. The 9 realms/planets are linked by the Bifrost (Einstein-Rosen Bridge); Xandar, The Nine Realms, Morag, Hala, Kyln and Knowhere are probably in the same galaxy; Ant-Man spoiler The Quantum Realm (Microverse) is part of the same dimension as everything else but is more fuzzy; The Bifrost can only be used to travel within The Nine Realms; In the comics the asgardian stuff is much more complex and confusing. Some writers use realms as planets and others write the realms as dimensions."
marvelstudios,3dziy0,CountScarlioni,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:57:46 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming that Xandar, Earth, Morag, Hala, Kyln and Knowhere are relatively close to one another, becauss the distance can be breached by spaceship, and it does not seem to take extremely long. I'm assuming you can't just board a spaceship on Earth and get to Asgard, or at least it would take years or longer. That is why they need the Bifrost. Am i making sense or not?"

Firstly there is the the question of what exactly it is. I mean, the place is flat, for crying out loud. Is is some kind of artificially-maintained region of space? Is it, unlike the other realms, some kind of dimension? Is it legitimately just a flat planet?

marvelstudios,3dz2vn,ThatGuyOnTheRoof,5,Mon Jul 20 18:21:01 2015 UTC,"Assuming we start in 2008:  Phase 1:  1) Spider-Man  Uncle Ben dies, Spidey fights the Green Goblin, Gwen Stacy dies.  2) X-Men  X-Men fight Magneto, not a lot happens.  3) Iron Man  Basically just the MCU Iron Man film.  4) Captain America  Basically the MCU CA film but with Black Widow at the end.  5) Thor   Basically the MCU Thor film.  6) The Avengers  The Avengers (Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Spider-Man, Wolverine and Black Widow) fight Loki.  Phase 2:  1) Spider-Man: Rise of the Rhino  Spider-Man meets MJ, he fights the Rhino.   2) X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills  The X-Men team up with Magneto to defeat Stryker. Magneto kills Rogue in the end.  3) Captain America: The Winter Soldier  CA finds the Winter Soldier, has a fight. Hawkeye joins CA with Black Widow in fighting him and making him good again.  4) Fantastic Four  The FF fight Doom and win. Not a lot happens.  5) Thor: The Surtur Saga  Odin, Thor and Loki team up to defeat Surtur. Odin dies and Thor becomes ruler of Asgard.  6) Hulk  Banner hates being the Hulk and tries to find a cure. Commits suicide a lot of times but fails. Eventually kills is girlfriend. This is kept a PG-13, though, so it is not too dark.  7) The Avengers: Age of Ultron  The Avengers (CA, Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch) kill Ultron. No one dies.  Phase 3:  1) Iron Man: Extremis  Iron Man fights extremis guys and then defeats the real Mandarin.  1) Captain America: The Secret Empire  Steve stops being Cap for a while whilst Hydra returns. It's up to the Winter Soldier to make Cap come back. They defeat Crossbones but decide not to kill him and arrest him.  2) Ant-Man  Hank Pym's Cold War adventures.  3) Fantastic Four: Dawn of Galactus  The FF fight Galactus. Big movie even though nothing really happens.  4) Spider-Man: One More Day  Venom kills MJ. Spider-Man goes through depression at the end.  5) World War Hulk  Hulk goes mental due to an unknown force. He calms down in the end.  6) X-Men: Apocalypse  The X-Men fight Apocalypse. The four horsemen are Wolverine, Angel, Magneto and Beast. Professor X dies and Cyclops goes crazy and kills a lot of people because of it.  7) Doctor Strange  The force that made Hulk go crazy is revealed to be Dormammu being an evil bastard. Strange defeats him.  8) Avengers: House of K  House of M with Kang the Conqueror. Lots of new characters introduced such as Nova, Captain Marvel and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Mutants go (mostly extinct).   Phase 4  1) Thor: Ragnarok  Shit goes down. Enough said. Earth and Asgard are in ruins. Thor steps down as King of Asgard to rebuild Earth (because it was his fault it was destroyed) and Loki is now the ruler of Asgard.   2) Iron Man: Demon in a Bottle  Iron Man's alcoholism goes too far and is now unfit for being a superhero. War Machine is now the new Iron Man.  2) Spider-Man: Spider-Verse  Octavius does something bad with the time-space continuum or something and lots of universes find a way into the main one. Lots of Spider-Men defeat Octavius and Parker sacrifices himself to save the universe. Miles Morales is now the main Spider-Man.   3) Captain Marvel  Carol Danvers fights a villain and wins (don't know much about this character unfortunately). She goes into space to find a new home for the people of Earth as the Earth is in ruins.  4) Captain America: Civil War  Iron vs Cap. Cap is killed by Crossbones and Bucky goes mental and brutally murders Crossbones. Lots of new heroes introduced. The Earth is now even worse due to the destruction of the war. Only a couple billion people on the Earth are still alive.  5) The Illuminati  To make sure that something like Civil War never happens again, Tony Stark (just him, not the Iron Man armour), Doctor Strange, Black Bolt, Hank Pym, Black Panther, Namor and Reed Richards make a team and sign a peace treaty. This film follows them as they alter the course of history after hearing about the destruction that Thanos will bring to the Earth. They successfully alter the course of history.  6) Fantastic Four: The Quest to Find the Silver Surfer  The FF find SS and defeat Annihilus. Nothing really happens.  7) Planet Hulk  The Illuminati send the Hulk into space after coming to the conclusion that he is unsafe for the Earth (mainly due to World War Hulk and the Earth's poor conditions). He becomes ruler of a civilisation but it gets destroyed by a bomb placed in the ship that he was sent into space in. Hulk is MAD.   7) Ant-Man: Yellow Jacket  The Pym Particles make Pym go evil and the new Ant-Man, Scott Lang, has to defeat him. Pym dies after accidentally killing himself. Lang is the new Ant-Man.  8)Black Panther  Defeats Klaw and that's it (don't know much about the character).  9) X-Men: Days of Future Past  Because of the new Sentinels made by the Illuminati to control the mutant population have been hacked into by Doom and Trask, Wolverine and Kitty Pryde go back in time to divert Trask from being so obsessed with mutants. They change the course of history but unfortunately, this has undone the efforts made by the Illuminati to stop Thanos coming to Earth. You can guess what happens soon after... Fortunately, the X-Men also make it so that the Earth is not as destroyed as it used to be and is now mostly back to normal.  10) Guardians of the Galaxy  Basically the MCU film although the team is already together at the start of the film.  10) Inhumans  Black Bolt defeats his brother and the monarchy is OK.  11) Avengers: Infinity War  Thanos comes to Earth and wrecks shit up. He kills Scott Lang and Tony Stark. He is still alive at the end but has been defeated by the Avengers with the help of Adam Warlock.  Phase 5 (last phase because I cba to carry this on)  1) Deadpool  Breaks the fourth wall a lot (due to the effects the Incursions that are revealed in the post-credits scene has on his brain). He doesn't know about the Incursions, though.  2) The Illuminati: The Beginning of the End  The Illuminati discover the incursions and decide to keep them a secret. Doom discovers them and tries to spread the news across the multiverse. He succeeds but is unable to spread it across the main universe. He is trapped in an alternate universe by the Illuminati.  3) Avengers: Original Sin  Thor is now unworthy of holding Mjolnir etc. They find that the Watcher has died after unsuccessfully stopping an Incursion. The Incursions are now fully known about by the Avengers.  4) Guardians of the Galaxy: War of Kings  The Guardians are now involved in a war between the Shi'ar Empire and the Kree empire. Drax is finally able to kill Thanos although he dies in the process.  5) Thor: A New Age  Jane Foster becomes worthy of wielding Mjolnir and defeats Loki who had Asgard under a corrupt rule.  6) Captain America: Rise of Tomorrow  Bucky is being followed by the Ten Rings and Hydra. They are trying to assassinate him. Falcon and Bucky both try to be Captain America to outsmart them. Steve Rodger from a different dimension comes to warn them about the Incursions but is killed soon after by a rogue Hydra agent.  7) X-Men: The Pheonix Saga  Jean Grey is now destroying things. She is then killed by Wolverine.  8) Spider-Man: Cataclysm  Miles Morales and a few of the Fantastic Four defeat Galactus.  8) Inhumans: Inhumanity  Stuff happens (don't know much about the comic storyline of this).  9) Captain Marvel: The Carol Corps  The Carol Corps go after various villains. It's a fun, light-hearted film but goes dark at the end when most of the team are killed by something caused by an Incursion.  10) Namor  Namor defeats a villain.  11) Fantastic Four: Salem's Seven  A rogue Hydra agent tries to kill the Fantastic Four and forms the Salem's Seven.  12) Black Panther: A War of the World  Namor vs. the Black Panther. The BP wins.  13) The Irredeemable Ant-Man  O'Grady is Ant-Man.  14) Avengers: Secret Wars  Most of the dead characters return to defeat Doom. They win in the end and the MCU gets rebooted.  Then LRedditor15 steps down from being the producer of these films and takes a much needed break.  EDIT: I spent too much time on this. What even is my life... -_-"

But I'd make the Fantastic Four be an existing super hero team.  Like they were in their teens to early 20s in the 80s when they got their powers and they're still active today (and Jon Hamm is Reed).  After Iron Man's origin thingy, he'd start trying to form his own team.  Then we'd get the suite of Hulk, Thor, and Ant-man/Wasp.  They'd team up in an Avengers film which would also see the return of Captain America.  X-men and Spidey are in there too.  Spider-man would be trying to join the FF even though he's a teen."

marvelstudios,3dz2vn,Shadow_Gabriel,2,Mon Jul 20 18:51:36 2015 UTC,"Because I'm fine with the MCU as it is I'm going to go with the concept of if it was made many years prior and this is how it would turnout in my mind:  1998ish: Iron Man directed by Quentin Tarantino, starring Tom Cruise as Tony Stark. Tells his origins, focuses more on Tony and George Clooney as Nick Fury at the end since he was in talks for that role around that time, not sure how I would feel about that though  1999: Spider-Man directed by James Cameron, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Peter Parker. Tells his origin, fights Doc Ock played by Arnold Schwarzenegger  1999: X-Men directed by Bryan Singer, starring most of the actual cast. Changes stuff to fit the 1990s show cast and use actual costumes  2000: Iron Man 2, sequel to the first one. Focuses on the Demon in a Bottle story  2001: Captain America directed by someone I'm not sure of and starring someone else I'm not sure of. Pretty much the First Avenger  2001: Spider-Man 2, sequel to the first one. Focuses on the Night Gwen Stacy Dies story  2002: Thor directed by Sam Raimi, starring Nikolaj Coster-Waldu. Pretty much a Sam Raimi version of Thor 1  2002: X-Men: X-Tinction, sequel to the first one with a probably better subtitle. Deals some form of the Mutant Registration Act  2003: Hulk directed by Ang Lee, maybe starring someone other than Eric Bana. Same plot as the actual movie  2004: The Avengers Assemble not sure who would direct, starring everyone in the other films. Same plot as Avengers  That's where I'll leave off, not sure what would follow."
marvelstudios,3dz2vn,JuanRiveara,2,Mon Jul 20 19:14:59 2015 UTC,"(this was half-written and then I left so by the time it's posted this it'll probably never be read, but what the hell)  I'm slightly modifying your exercise and going with the idea that it's sometime 5 to 10 years in the future, Marvel has gotten the rights back after Disney has made so much Star Wars money that they offered FOX the combined GDP of several third-world countries, and they are taking advantage of that and the fact that most of the actors are getting too old to just blow up the MCU and start it all over again. an MCU2, if you will:   PHASE 1 (AKA ""Assemble""):   Captain America and the Invaders: Cap's origin is covered in like a two-minute faux-newsreel at the beginning, then we cut to near the end of the war: HYDRA (led by the Red Skull and Baron Zemo) and the rest of the Nazi war machine is on the run, but word comes in that a new player has emerged. Somehow the Nazis have made contact with the lost civilization of Atlantis. Faced with this unbelievable threat, allied command assembles a team: Cap, Bucky, Jim ""The Human Torch"" Hammond, Agent Peggy Carter of the SOE, Union Jack, a WWII incarnation of Alpha Flight's Guardian, the Golden Age Angel and a speedster named Robert Frank (the words ""The Whizzer"" are NEVER said). A white Nick Fury and his howling commandos also appear. In the end, of course, Namor catches onto the Nazis, leading Zemo to launch some sort of doomsday weapon of alien origin at Namor's capitol city. You can guess what then happens to Cap and Bucky, but in this telling Namor also joins them and is also caught in the blast. The Red Skull escapes, but Guardian and Torch pursue Zemo and one of his closest scientific advisors into a glue factory. Stuff happens, Torch hits a particular volatile chemical and the place goes up in smoke, with Zemo escaping with horrible burns and the Torch apparently being destroyed. Guardian is presumed dead... until the post-credits, when he walks out, his costume destroyed, his injuries rapidly healing... and then, when a HYDRA clean-up crew (they already have a body bag holding Zemo's advisor, who is looking rather... green) comes towards him, he smiles and puts up his hands... at which point blades emerge from them.   Fantastic Four: Combines the classic origin and Ultimate origin: it's a space accident, but the accident occurs when they try to use an experimental FTL drive that involves briefly shunting themselves through the Negative Zone. The villain is the Mole Man in a manner similar to his comic book appearance in FF #1, but throughout the movie there are news reports that some sort of mysterious charismatic leader is fighting to free Latveria from it's dictator. At the end of the movie, we see that new ruler of Latveria: Viktor Von Doom. And he has three things on his mind: Latveria, his Mother... and an old college friend named Reed Richards. Oh, and the Skrulls briefly show up in a vision that the team experiences when they are getting cosmic-rayed.   Peter Parker, Spider-Man: High School Peter with Betty Brant as the love interest (although she dumps him about 75% of the way into the film and it's implied that Peter is preparing to ask Gwen Stacy on a date) and Doc Ock as the villain. In this telling Doc Ock is a deranged former Stark Industries employee (said to, for example, have at one point accused one of his co-workers of being an alien in disguise) who quickly forgets about Stark as soon as Spider-Man starts foiling his plans. The film ends with Peter answering the door, expecting Gwen, only to be met with a certain redhead who says ""Face it, Tiger, you just hit the jackpot."" During a scene at Stark Industries it's mentioned that Stark is somewhere in the Middle East showing off some new military tech, implying he'll be becoming Iron Man very soon. Johnny Storm cameos at one point and there's some good old Torch/Spidey banter.   The Uncanny X-Men: Standard ""fight-with-Magneto"" plot (although Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch show up as part of his brotherhood), but SHIELD makes it's first real appearance (led by the Black Nick Fury, the mixed-race son of the Howling Commando of legend) when it serves as cannon-fodder for Magneto and The Hulk is said to exist when Hank McCoy (already blue and furry) makes a joke about how if he and the Hulk were combined they'd make a very angry Grinch.   Tales to Astonish: An anthology film of three 40-to-45 minute mini-movies: Tony Stark going into battle publicly in his ""real"" Iron Man suit for the first time against the Melter, Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne stopping Egghead, and finally a tale of SHIELD Agent Natasha Romanoff infiltrating a secret meeting and finding that the business leaders behind the Roxxon conglomerate aren't what they seem (...in that they are DAMN DIRTY SKRULLS). Ultimately, these tie together in a very short five-minute story at the very end, in which Nick Fury, Romanoff and Agent Phil Coulson (called by his codename of ""Cheese"") discuss how something is going on but thankfully over the last few months and few years it appears that humanity seems to be getting it's heroes back at just the right time. The camera then pans and it is shown that they are looking over a heavily sedated but very-much-alive Captain America.   Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes: Somewhat a combination of the 616, the Ultimate and the original MCU origin, only without Loki. Fury puts together a team (the time-lost Captain America, billionaire playboy Tony Stark, shrinking scientist-couple Ant-Man and Wasp, and Natasha Romanoff AKA Black Widow) to face what he believes is an impending alien invasion, only for it to be first called into action when The Hulk appears in New York City for reasons unknown. Joining forces with the Fantastic Four (and, yes, that does mean we get a Thing-Hulk fight), Spider-Man, and the X-Men's Wolverine (""Happened to be in town, name's Logan."") they are able to subdue the beast, who unexpectedly turns into scientist Bruce Banner. It is then, however, that it's revealed that Black Widow never escaped the ROXXON meeting, and actually it's a Skrull, who signals for the invasion to begin in hopes of striking while many of the world's superheroes are in one place. The FF, Logan and Spider-Man are quickly captured, and reports soon come in of alien landings elsewhere around the world. And so it falls to the Avengers to save the world. And, yes, the real Natasha does turn out to be alive, and the Skrulls are sent packing. Then, in the end credits, we go to the Bifrost Bridge in Asgard, where Loki watches what was unfolding and says ""Well, that seems like an interesting world...""  If anyone is interested in future phases, let me know."

Captain America is created to help fight the Nazis and Hydra. Bucky is seemingly killed, and Cap defeats Red Skull and his armies, destroying their super weapons. Red Skull is not killed and escapes. End Credits scene: Shows Red Skull looking down at his hand, saying, ""I've still got one more trick up my sleeve,"" and the camera pans over to reveal the cosmic cube.  2) All Winners Squad (2008)  Takes place In 1944. Red Skull returns, now teamed up with Japanese super soldier Yellow Claw. They threaten to launch super powered missiles at the US, and so Cap and the OSS assemble a team of superheroes consisting of Namor, Sun Girl, and Human Torch, with Cap as the leader. They travel to the secret fortress of Hydra and defeat Red Skull. Yellow Claw tries to escape with the missiles, but Cap jumps onto his plane, and defeats Yellow Claw. Human Torch blasts the plane with a fireball, not knowing that Cap is on it. Now that the plane is too damaged to fly, Cap decides to crash it into the ocean, freezing him.  End Credits: Hydra has Red Skull's body,and they place him in a cryogenic freezing chamber, saying, ""we'll still have use for him,"" and the camera shows Red Skull in a tube right next to the tube that is housing Bucky."

Villain is Green Goblin (though he isn't killed at the end, escapes without a trace).   X-Men-Establishes mutants' place in MCU and begins with negative public perception of mutants. The X-Men defeat the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants--their leader (Magneto) remains in the shadows--and public perception is improved.   Iron Man-Jon Favreau's 2008 film untouched.   Fantastic Four-FF's origin story. The Fantastic Four prevent the Earth from being invaded by the Skrulls; Dr. Doom is present and set up, but doesn't appear as the main villain.   Thor-Kenneth Branaugh's 2011 film untouched.   Captain America-Joe Johnston's 2011 film untouched.   The Avengers-Loki returns from Thor, and his plan is the same as  in the original Avengers film. This time, the Avengers lineup is: Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, Ant-Man/Giant Man and Wasp (Banner, Pym, and Janet are introduced). Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, and some of the X-Men help fight the Chitauri in the battle of New York.

They fail, but Doom is held at bay and the international community keeps an eye on Latveria.  Iron Man: Armor Wars-Tony tries to stop the spread of his weapons on the Black Market, his main adversary is a man in a Crimson Cloak with very advanced weaponry who is collecting his weapons and constantly fucks with him in his quest. (Post credits stinger is that Hank Pym tells Tony that they need to talk after hearing the report of the man in the cloak.)   X-Men 2-The X-Men stop the beginning of the Sentinel program, which is revealed to be secretly started by Magneto, who wants to use the Sentinels to ignite a war between man and mutant. Magneto is stopped, but escapes.  Spider-Man: Underworld-Spider-Man is pushed to his limits as he tries to stop the Kingpin and his criminal underworld. Daredevil is introduced and helps him defeat and expose Wilson Fisk.   Ant-Man-Details Hank's creation of Ultron with the motive of preventing another alien invasion (like Tony in AoU). Things go awry, and Ultron escapes despite Hank and Janet traveling the world to stop him wherever he goes. (Opportunity to set up additional heroes around the world).   Thor 2-Loki escapes Asgardian prison and Thor chases him across the nine realms. Loki scarifies himself in the end to save Thor from fire-demons who are angry at the Asgardians for trespassing on their world.   The Avengers 2-Revealed to be the Crimson Cloak from Armor Wars, Ultron takes on the Avengers. The new lineup replaces Captain America with Wolverine. (Captain America has gone missing. In the post credits scene, he's revealed to be in HYDRA's custody, who reveal to him that they have infiltrated SHIELD). Magneto reappears and teams up with Ultron, who both want the human race destroyed; the threat is larger and more challenging without Cap's leadership. In the end, Ultron is destroyed and Magneto is sent to prison. The second post credits tease features Doctor Doom, sitting in his castle in Latveria, holding a meteorite that fell nearby (this is later revealed to be an Infinity Stone.)"

Plus, I don't really like what that does to the flow of the story, since the ""Tony has PTSD"" story of IM3 really feels like it ought to come right after Avengers. Sure, Thor 2 picks up from Avengers too, but all it really means for the characters is that Loki is in jail.  If I was going to pick a ""perfect"" order, it'd be:   Iron Man 3 Thor: The Dark World Guardians of the Galaxy Captain America: The Winter Soldier Avengers: Age of Ultron Ant-Man   That keeps things roughly chronological (although if you dive into the minutiae of on-screen datestamps and the passage of time on Agents of SHIELD, Cap 2 probably does take place before GOTG, in late 2013), but in particular it means Thor 2 and Cap 2's stingers are followed directly by the films they tease."

marvelstudios,3dwu8j,plymouthpower,5,Mon Jul 20 11:09:40 2015 UTC,"It's made very clear that Ant-Man is after AOU, and not just immediately after. So Cap 3 will be at least some time after Ant-man. It's made clear Cap 3 hasn't happened yet in the 2nd post-credits scene."
marvelstudios,3dwu8j,NaggingNavigator,2,Mon Jul 20 12:09:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry, my comment wasn't very clear, I meant to say after Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War starts and possibly Ant-Man fits in there before Civil War is over. I think that since what we see in the after credits scene is in the middle of Civil War. Meaning that it (Civil War) had started before Ant-Man closed."
marvelstudios,3dwu8j,plymouthpower,2,Mon Jul 20 18:41:43 2015 UTC,"So Cap 3 will be at least some time after Ant-man. It's made clear Cap 3 hasn't happened yet in the 2nd post-credits scene.   I disagree.  At the end of Ant-Man, Falcon learns about Ant-Man via Michael Pena. In the post-credit scene Falcon ""knows a guy"". This is a scene from Cap 3 that takes place partway through the story, after they've found/captured Bucky. So there could definitely be some overlap."

My guess is, since they have 5 movies to do before Infinity, they all just take place at the same time which will be the new ""present,"" and then all come together for that one.

marvelstudios,3dwu8j,gman9627,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:50:25 2015 UTC,"Marvel's settled into having their films occur more-or-less in real time at this point, so I fully expect it to be ~2 years."
marvelstudios,3dwu8j,Jalaguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:30 2015 UTC,The only reason I feel weird about it being in real time is that means it'd take place about four years after Dark World. It takes Thor that long to figure out Loki is on the throne? Just seems strange.
marvelstudios,3dwu8j,Hawkguy67,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:57:19 2015 UTC,"Thor is transported via the Bifrost at the end of the film, so it's a safe bet his first (and only) stop is Asgard. So most likely right afterwards."

marvelstudios,3dwu8j,CountScarlioni,3,Mon Jul 20 06:09:41 2015 UTC,"Most do, yes, and most of the Phase 3 movies still will. However, they have said that that may not be the case for all of them."
marvelstudios,3dwu8j,Hawkguy67,3,Mon Jul 20 06:21:56 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. good point. I can't imagine how they'd address that. I mean, if Thor clearly felt that Asgard was in danger during AoU, he wouldn't exactly be kicking back and relaxing for a few years.  Maybe they do a time jump and he's been investigating what's going on in Asgard, and the start of the movie is Loki's reveal? It would be similar to Thor: TDW when Thor had been fighting on different worlds to keep the peace ever since the events of the Avengers, but only showed that final battle before he comes to retrieve Jane."
marvelstudios,3dwu8j,Supertrinko,3,Mon Jul 20 06:14:42 2015 UTC,"I think that's a guideline, not a rule. There's no point sticking to it if the story needs them to go off track a bit.

He's very hesitant to say anything bad about anyone (except himself), and even went out of his way to downplay the dirty way Sony had treated him.

They respect source material (cough Fantastic Four cough), and are good at making some of the greatest villains (Loki, Winter Soldier, Red Skull, Kingpin) come to life on the big screen (minus Mandarin, Whiplash, and Malekeith). It could be worse (COUGH FANTASTIC FOUR COUGH)."

Also, they've made Doom into a whiny, teenage hacker. Even you have to see it isn't honoring the source material. There were reports that the director told the main stars NOT to read about their characters in the comics because they wouldn't be based on them."
marvelstudios,3dtrry,freshkicks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:44:34 2015 UTC,"Have you seen the interview with the guy playing doom?

marvelstudios,3dtrry,FPSGamer48,3,Mon Jul 20 08:49:45 2015 UTC,"This is the interview I've seen the most. I like this quote from someone when they announced the director said none of the actors should read the comics: ""These are already created characters, shaped over many decades by writers, artists, and readers. That's what people want to see. Not a 're-imagining'. Not someone else's 'take'. We want to see, in the hands of an able director and able actors, what can be done with this source material. We've seen it work, sometimes quite beautifully, in franchises like X-Men, Spider-Man, Batman, Thor, Iron Man, the list goes on. We've also seen it tank when movie producers, writers and directors take too many personal liberties with our beloved characters (Juggernaut, Catwoman, Deadpool, Superman, again, to name a few).  What makes FF unique and special as a superhero team is that they're related (brother/sister, husband/wife, and friend), and that one battle they're always engaged in is the publicity angle - being in the spotlight all the time and how they handle it.  Although I think it could be done in many other franchises, this is NOT the team to change the ethnicity of one of its members, to futz too much with the costume, or to take any other 'high-minded' directions in an effort to 'connect' with audiences. The original team, if handled properly, can already do that. We do absolutely need a reboot from the soggy, flat, uninspired characters of the first go-round series. But I feel like the direction they've chosen here is rewriting the whole story altogether. If I was Marvel, I'd be distancing myself from this project - as far away as I could get. Can see the writing on the wall already. I loved Chronicle, and think this director can make something memorable and special.  But you don't need to paint a butterfly. It's already been painted.""  He's right. The original Fantastic Four movie seems MUCH closer to the comics, and therefore shows respect to the characters. This movie shows no respect to the original characters."

marvelstudios,3dtrry,FPSGamer48,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:33:51 2015 UTC,"Because from what info they've given us, it is easily interpreted that he strays too far from the comics, such as being a teen hacker instead of a country ruling mastermind."

marvelstudios,3dv4c2,SuperDryb0nes,47,Mon Jul 20 13:33:08 2015 UTC,I bet Variety has had this saved in the draft folder for awhile waiting for Marvel to not have a spectacular opening weekend.
marvelstudios,3dv4c2,Melanismdotcom,7,Sun Jul 19 20:42:06 2015 UTC,"[MOVIE] demonstrates both the power of the Marvel brand and what can hold it back.  The film’s [NUMBER] debut would have been a strong start for nearly any other company, but for Marvel, which has fielded a dizzying number of blockbusters, it is something of a disappointment. [MOVIE] opening ranks below the numbers that films centering on Captain America, Thor and Iron Man put up during their launches."
marvelstudios,3dv4c2,ikeaborn,45,Mon Jul 20 10:31:00 2015 UTC,They should have had a cameo from Iron Man or something to up the ante.   Nope. That is how you end up with this kind of situations  I say we wait for the final box office. There is no reason for the same audience that saw GoTG to not see this movie. It's only a matter of other summer movies slowing down and people realizing through reviews and word of mouth that the movie is good.
marvelstudios,3dv4c2,silvershadow881,16,Sun Jul 19 21:34:24 2015 UTC,"I think word of  mouth is going to sell it pretty hard. I think Marvel may have known beforehand they'd have a harder time marketing this than Guardians because of the director's thing and because Ant-Man probably is just harder to market than Guardians.   You know what other movie didn't put the best parts in its trailers and really relied on word of mouth to sustain it over a really long period and carry it to a VERY VERY large final haul? Frozen. That is the 8th highest grossing movie ever and it's first wide opening weekend was only $67 million domestic - more than Ant-Man but NOT the $150+ that things like Avengers, Jurassic World, or Furious 7 have.  Also, it doesn't have to make a fuckton of money. Avengers budget was $220 mil, this was only $130 (yes, 'only', and it doesn't include advertising, but you get the idea). I think Ant-Man also had to prove that Marvel can still tell the smaller stories outside of it's TV and Netflix realm, and as along at Ant-Man does well relative to it's size, then it will!"
marvelstudios,3dv4c2,delta835,-3,Sun Jul 19 22:10:48 2015 UTC,"Except Frozen was an immediate sensation, as was Guardians. Those movies exploded with audience praise. Frozen was praised for its themes, songs and characters. Guardians was praised for its lively energy, enjoyable characters, use of 70's and 80's music, and unique style of dialogue. Ant-Man doesn't feel like it had as much of the infectious energy that had audiences running into the theaters again and again. Nobody is humming the soundtracks (orchestral movie scores don't rank highly anymore, with the only exception being the late James Horner's work), nobody is clamoring about that one scene that needs to be experienced again (only the after credits scenes which are teasing at hopefully more memorable films, and nobody is yelling ""Dude! Dude! You have to see this movie! This movie ROCKS!!!"" like they did with Iron Man and Guardians."

I realize it's only a trailer, but the more I watch it and the more I realize how well they appear to be pivoting the ""cons"" from Man of Steel into legitimate plot points and opportunities for genuine character development, the more I get jazzed for what DC is doing.  Also (and, again, it's a trailer, but) the Suicide Squad movie looks pretty interesting, too.   DC looks like they are combining the best of the Dark Knight Trilogy's tone with the best of TASM/MCU's genuine ""fun-ness.""  I'm jazzed."
marvelstudios,3dv4c2,FalconLorenzo,3,Mon Jul 20 08:19:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's going to be bad or anything. That wasn't even the point of the image.  But I don't think DC's way of marketing every upcoming movie with Batman is a good idea. Imagine if Ironman was in GoTG because Marvel thought it was hard to market. It would mean they don't trust their IP enough, and that their whole universe is based on one character. And it would have certainly made GoTG a worse movie.  Now you have suicide squad, where 6+ interesting villains need to have the joker in for support AND Batman. That says a lot about what Warner is trying to do (because apparently only movies with Batman are a success in their eyes.)"

It is not like they could make an Avengers movie every six months (and even if they could it would get stale fast), and it is smart to develop their lesser known characters like Ant-Man, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange and Inhumans while Marvel is riding high.

marvelstudios,3dv4c2,FalconLorenzo,7,Mon Jul 20 08:32:36 2015 UTC,Really to me when you look at the numbers and then compare them to other movies of the genre it's a pretty respectable number. Probably way above the average.  Comedies and/or heist movies never pull in huge numbers.  The movie has almost made back the budget in the first 3 days and I expect word of mouth and repeat visits to give it some legs.  People are crazy to even try to compare this to GotG.
marvelstudios,3dv4c2,Xrathe,3,Sun Jul 19 22:59:34 2015 UTC,I keep seeing it made $58 million domestically but I can't find a worldwide figure. Where are you seeing that it almost made its money back?

marvelstudios,3dv4c2,TripleSkeet,3,Sun Jul 19 23:42:41 2015 UTC,"People were more hyped about Civil War after AoU came out. Also, Ant-Man isn't as marketable as something like GotG. I mean ""Ant-Man"" doesn't sound like something the mainstream audience would be to hyped about. That is why I was always skeptical over whether this would be the typical Marvel success. People point to GotG a lot, but like I said, the mainstream would most likely have an easier time liking something more like Guardians rather than a hero based off of ants."

I saw it at the alternate AMC theater on Van Ness in a room smaller than any at the Metreon that was half full. (This was Sunday at 7pm IMAX 3D)   Why? I don't know. Was it poor promotion? Was it never intended to be a ""big"" movie? Did they do the above because they couldn't sell the character? I still have no idea. Because it was fantastic.

It has better developed story than AoU (which just went from one action set piece to another with a bunch of random scenes foreshadowing the Infinity War).

Similarly, Stinky Pete and Lotso were huge parts of the sequels. Cinderella's step mother and sisters were big-ish parts of the story and helped define the narrative, like literally every villain I've listed here.  Same for Tangled and Frozen.  Wreck It Ralph literally starred the villain.  Sure, there are an equal number or more Disney movies where the villains are weaker or non-existent.  That doesn't change the fact that an important percentage of Disney movies' plots and/or protagonists are defined by their villains.  Disney aren't new to this."

Still, I like to play along, so let's go!  I think the last line of your OP speaks volumes.  Thanos needs to be set up as a major power.  Having him topple over anyone in his way on the path to gathering the stones would be a way to ""build him up"", kinda like wrestling, where a superstar crushes everyone in matches for a time.    Space: Well, we don't know for sure where his relationship with Loki stands.  Loki failed Thanos after all.  So, and again we're playing the guessing game, could Thanos be Ragnarok?  Let's review.  Ragnarok proper is the end and rebirth of Norse gods.  But the MCU version of Thor and Asgard are an advanced alien race mistaken for gods, not actual mythological figures.  Could a clash between Loki and Thanos over the Space stone be the beginning of the end of Asgard?  It would help explain the title.  Reality: I think you covered it already...The Collector could be gathering for himself based on his actions.  ""1 down, 5 to go"", could be for himself or Thanos I suppose, but why inform the Guardians to the stone's power when Thanos has been trying to play this quietly so far.  I think this could be the first one to fall if Thanos attacks The Collector and catches him at a weak moment as he is rebuilding.    Power: In the hands of the Nova Corp.  Could be a large scale act of war if he goes for a full frontal assault.  This could be the start of Infinity War part 1 in my opinion.  A calling to War by Thanos, armed with 1 or 2 stones by that point.  Mind: In the head of the Vision....so not until Infinity War.  That one is anyone's guess.  Will he kill The Vision and rip it from his head?  Soul and Time are yet to be determined of course.  Everyone is calling for Dr Strange to introduce one of them....could happen.  And whichever one is left over?  Maybe Thanos already has it.  Really too early to call.  But I do think he's going to start wrecking shit now."
marvelstudios,3dyj47,PJL80,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:03:02 2015 UTC,I agree with this. Based on the movie release timeline I think we'll see thanos go after the collector while he's weak in GOTG2 maybe even the nova corps for the power stone and collect 2 stones in one movie. Then head to Asgard to get the space stone in Thor 3. Or like you said get the power stone in the beginning of IW part 1. Most likely get the mind stone last seeing as it's on earth with the vision.  As for the soul and time I'm not sure how that will play out. Maybe time is with dr strange and soul hopefully Adam warlock but no idea what movie that would occur in. By the end of IW part 1 I think thanos will have all the stones and I hope they show him collect each one instead of it happening off screen.

marvelstudios,3dsi1p,kaimason1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:40:56 2015 UTC,FFF has ties with Mole Man who's rights are also with F4. Number of appearances doesn't matter. Kang is mostly an Avengers villain but his rights are still with F4.
marvelstudios,3dsi1p,shotterken,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:29:45 2015 UTC,"Fin Fang Foom's ties with Mole Man are definitely not remotely anywhere near as strong as his ties to the Mandarin or even Doctor Strange. Kang actually does have heavy F4 ties in his Rama-Tut incarnation as well as in his actual origin (I think Reed's father played a big role in Kang's creation) and name, and even then, I'm fairly certain he'd be shared like the Maximoffs and Kree or 100% Marvel owned, which leads me to believe he was considered important enough to specifically name in the F4 rights package but for whatever reason wasn't named in the Avengers package. Fin Fang Foom absolutely would not have been named in any rights package, leaving things like publication and character history to determine rights, and those very much point to Marvel characters far more than any Fox characters. Pretty much every Marvel character has ties with every other one due to all existing in the same universe originally and having decades of publication history to tangle things up, that doesn't mean a minor connection will tie things up 100%. If Fin Fang Foom was entirely Fox territory based on such a minor little connection I'd expect the Kree, the Skrulls, Adam Warlock (along with the Infinity Gems since they're heavily tied to him), Black Panther, Inhumans, Celestials, the Maximoffs, and many more things to be indisputably on that side of the fence which obviously aren't."

marvelstudios,3dvu8k,ofthe33rdDegree,9,Sun Jul 19 23:23:10 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see Luis again. I don't know how he'd fit in to SHIELD though, but if they could find a way that'd be cool. And seeing how Peña just did a TV series this year, Gracepoint, it wouldn't be too hard to get him on their for an episode or something. Oh and I think Rudd totally would be down for it as well, he does a lot of guest appearances on tv. He pops up a lot on adult swim and had a hilarious recurring role on parks and rec, not to mention he kinda got his start on Friends. It'd be cool to see Lily show up as Wasp too, shouldn't be too hard to do on shield's budget, as long as they keep flying to a minimum. The only one who'd be tough to get is Douglas IMO, but hey I guess it wouldn't be too hard for him to film a small guest spot"
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,stormz96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:45:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe some guy hears about something, then tells someone and then they tell someone etc. all in Michael Penas voice, the it's him telling Hope or even scott"
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,camzabob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:09:42 2015 UTC,I bet Luis would get along really well with those two thief-turned-SHIELD agents from Item 47! I'd love to see them again :p
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,ksaid1,8,Mon Jul 20 08:02:22 2015 UTC,"So SHIELD is tracking a guy, and to get intel on him they find a source. Luis, who heard a thing from someone who knew a guy who went out with a girl who's cousin was in a band with the guy they're looking for."
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,Supertrinko,2,Mon Jul 20 06:28:44 2015 UTC,I don't see any chance to fit any Ant Man charcters in the context of the show. Hope is going to be Wasp in a phase 3 film and is going to train for that while Luis was kinda like comdey relief and there is no reason for him to show up. AoS can stand alone now so i don't see the need to cross over.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,SwagBelow,4,Sun Jul 19 23:44:20 2015 UTC,I could definitely see Luis just doing a funny cameo where they're interrogating him for information.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,Supertrinko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:29:38 2015 UTC,The cameo would be a gimmick and not be  organic at all. Shield is an organization why would they interrogate Luis a small time thief? Cameos are cool if they serve a purpose but if they don't there is no point.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,SwagBelow,3,Mon Jul 20 11:35:01 2015 UTC,"Course it would be a gimmick, it's a funny cameo. Gimmicks aren't inherently bad  For a small time thief he seems connected to a couple superheroes."
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,Supertrinko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:56:34 2015 UTC,"They could have a montage of ransoms that they're interrogating to find out about ant man and Michael Penas cut in between others, then he finally says something useful, and he's in the rest of the show"
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,camzabob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:12:23 2015 UTC,I don't think Luis would rat out his friend Scott and SHIELD is not in the business of tracking superheroes.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,SwagBelow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:55 2015 UTC,"Totally fair! I could see it factoring into a larger plot with the Secret Warriors story line, but it could just as easily feel gimmicky and unnecessary."
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,SwagBelow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:47:17 2015 UTC,The secret warriors are an inhuman thing though and not a every superhero thing. Wasp should be an Avenger and not a secret warrior.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,Remi15,3,Mon Jul 20 00:28:05 2015 UTC,Why do you assume it's exclusively inhumans has this been started outright?  I assumed Deathlok would be a member.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,SwagBelow,2,Mon Jul 20 01:03:32 2015 UTC,Yeah in this marvel.Com it says Coulson will be tracking inhumans mostly for the team http://marvel.com/news/tv/24779/coulson_will_encounter_the_secret_warriors_on_marvels_agents_of_shield_on_abc But Deathlok is cool too. But my main point is Wasp needs to be an Avenger with Ant man and not a secret warrior.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,Remi15,2,Mon Jul 20 01:36:33 2015 UTC,"I agree that she should be am Avenger, but you could easily give Hope (and not Wasp) a cameo to retrieve Cross's Pym particle recreation from Carson and Hydra."
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,SwagBelow,2,Mon Jul 20 02:29:45 2015 UTC,But I think that scene was a set up for the sequel or civil war setup then for an appearance on AoS. Carson was an enemy of Scott Lang from the comics and the Hydra that will be pursing those threads will be Zemo's Hydra and not Ward's.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,marvelking666,3,Mon Jul 20 02:43:37 2015 UTC,"I really doubt that Secret Warriors will be exclusive to Inhumans.. I mean, the comics had all kinds of different characters that were involved in the teams."
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,SwagBelow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:33:11 2015 UTC,The MCU is kinda different from the comics and they have been pushing this Inhuman since last season so i think its safe to say this will be an inhuman team.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,BiggChicken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:29:25 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it make sense though for Daisy and Coulson to try to recruit them for their team?   I'm sure Hank would be against it because of his past experiences with Shield and so it wouldn't go anywhere. But Ant-man and Wasp joining the Secret Warriors because they want to do some good and these guys are asking them, then later being called up to the big leagues because Falcon knows a guy. It totally makes sense.  I guarantee that Scott Lang doesn't consider himself on par with the Avengers."
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,SwagBelow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:21:45 2015 UTC,He fought and Avenger and won. I think Scott thinks he is an Avenger level hero and him and Wasp joining the secret warriors makes no sense. Ant-Man and Wasp were avengers in the comics and don't even know that Shield exists. It makes sense for them to be Avengers and not secret warriors.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,BiggChicken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:29:15 2015 UTC,"And remember how jazzed up he was about that? You and I see them on the Avengers level. Hank and Hope might too, but Scott doesn't.  Dethlok is a great comparison for him.  He's got a suit that lets him do these great thing but those guy are the Mother F'n AVENGERS!    And I didn't say it would make sense for them to join. They're movie characters. Marvel isn't going to demote them to TV.  But it makes perfect sense for Coulson and Daisy to approach them. Why wouldn't you want Ant-man on your team??(wasp doesn't exist yet)    Do an episode where they have something happen whole approach in Ant-man where he helps them out cuz he's there and it's a great premise for a cross over episode."
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,SwagBelow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:40:08 2015 UTC,It's just a gimmick though and not organic to the plot. Ant-man is a superhero on his way to becoming public and being active in civil war. Just because someone has powers does not mean they automatically have to become secret warriors or approached by Coulson and Skye. The whole point of the caterpillars project was to be a team of anonymous powered agents for shield.Superheroes like Ant-man are in the public and are known by the people so it would not work.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,BiggChicken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:51:53 2015 UTC,"Who knows about Ant-man? No one saw his battle, he was and inch tall.   You're running into an issue that's common for viewers. You're basically God. You know the past, you can see the future. You can even see alternate timelines and realities. The characters in universe can't. Scott Lang has no idea that he will become an Avenger.  He doesn't even know that Falcon looking for him is a good thing yet, they were fighting last time they met and he broke into the Avengers facility. Falcon might be looking for payback.   Coulson and Shield monitor new feeds and would probably investigate something like the events in Ant-man. That's pretty much their entire job. Whether to recruit or detain Ant-man will depend on their encounter but seeking out these powered people is the stated Shield mission currently. It doesn't get any more organic than that!"
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,SwagBelow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:06:09 2015 UTC,That is not there job anymore though. Shield has become smaller now are used to be involved in every thing but since Winter Solider there Influence is not involved with every hero anymore. Ant-Man even confirmed that Spider-Man has been a hero for a while and Shield does not even care. Every superhero is not under Shield's watch anymore because they are a small organization.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,BiggChicken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:52:15 2015 UTC,"They don't have the resources to blanket the earth with agents anymore, but that doesn't change their mission. Coulson has specifically said they're trying to track down all the powered people. With the Inhumans out there, that's their primary focus. And The Caterpillars project is their task squad of power people they're able to bring in.   Of course this is all based off about 30 seconds of screen time on the finale and we don't know how it's playing out when we come back with the S3 premier.   Also""guy who crawls on walls"" doesn't necessarily mean Spider-man.  And even if it does, it doesn't mean he's done anything more than nab a few purse snatchers. He may not be on Shield limited radar.   Imploding building and giant toy train get on the radar."
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,FPSGamer48,2,Mon Jul 20 22:03:08 2015 UTC,"If Lily could show up that'd be great! I agree in that her being experienced in TV would help, as she won't request impossible prices for appearing like Robert Downey Jr would. That's why I hope we can see Doctor Strange appear in a Marvel Knights series with Ghost Rider, Moon Knight, Punisher, and Blade. Cumberbatch came from TV, he knows how it works."
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,captainpostal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:31:15 2015 UTC,"They could have Black Goliath (or is he just Goliath now?) as a character using Pym Particles. He had an important subplot in Civil War (not that the movie will follow the comics, but AoS could incorporate it in a movie tie in)."
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,MarvelSeer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:52:01 2015 UTC,As much as I would live to see Luis again thats not going to happen. If they do a crossover it would be about what happens to Pym Tech in which we could see Evangeline again.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,BiggChicken,2,Mon Jul 20 13:24:21 2015 UTC,Maybe we get a one shot of Luis hanging out with Darcy and Happy

marvelstudios,3dvu8k,LRedditor15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:06:15 2015 UTC,I'd love to see Luis with the AoS team. I'd imagine that he'd get on really well with the younger members of SHIELD but will annoy Coulson and May.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,74three1989,0,Mon Jul 20 00:42:38 2015 UTC,"SPOILERISH  I'd much rather see ant man stuff in agent carter, I don't see a logical reason other than ""hey it's all connected!!!!!"" for AoS. What is the story they could tell? I think that's far more interesting/important than a random insert MCU movie character here for a standalone episode.   Agent carter on the other hand, maybe in a couple years (fingers crossed the show gets renewed again and again) we see a 70's peggy carter or something or whatever the timeline was showing off a young pym doing his thing from those photos. now there is a story to work around"
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,JuanRiveara,4,Sun Jul 19 23:34:24 2015 UTC,You could say the same about Sif being on AoS and I would say both times turned out well. They could work someone into the show it's written well.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,Remi15,2,Mon Jul 20 00:03:37 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely love it if we got to at least Season 3 of Agent Carter, and got to see early S.H.I.E.L.D. operations in the 1950's, when it was still a fledgling organization. And you're right, they could totally cast a young Hank Pym (who could pop up in another flashback in a hypothetical Ant-Man sequel, too!)"
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,smileimhigh,3,Sun Jul 19 23:41:38 2015 UTC,Hydra dude escaped with a vial of Cross's version of the Pym particle. Last AoS season finale set up Hydra for a major comeback next season.

marvelstudios,3dvu8k,SwagBelow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:47:02 2015 UTC,"They're recruiting powered people for the Caterpillars project. Ant-man is a powered person.  It would make total sense to do an episode with him. And of course Hank squashes the whole ""working with shield"" thing, but Ant-man does the Dethlok role from season 2 where he's a friend and out there if you need him."
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,BiggChicken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:27:43 2015 UTC,They are not recruiting all powered people. It has been confimed to be an Inhuman team.
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,Mike5482,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:53:59 2015 UTC,"By who? Production team? We the viewers know that the team will be primarily, if not exclusively Inhumans. Coulson and Daisy on the other hand aren't discriminating against where the power comes from. They won't pass on Ant-man just because he's not an inhuman.   You have to learn to separate Viewer Mode where we discuss what will happen(Inhumans team. Ant-man and avenger, etc) and In Universe mode where we can discuss world events in terms of how they are in the story. (Ant-man ISN'T an Avenger. Shield is looking for Powered people. Etc. )"
marvelstudios,3dvu8k,JuanRiveara,0,Mon Jul 20 21:10:27 2015 UTC,"Ant-Man vs Secret Warriors.  Make it happen Marvel!  If Gordon were still alive, ti would be cool to see a Gordon vs Ant-Man fight.  Michael Pena should hook up with Daisy.  Funny, I only know the actor's name and not the character."

He has a decent track record and some pretty awesome action movies.  Though to be honest, they should hire someone who has a vision/is a fan of the character.

I'm sure Marvel has a board on a wall in a room that says/said this is what happens if we get Spider-Man and this is what happens if we don't, this is what happens if we get F4 and this is what happens if we don't, this is what happens if Ant-Man's great and this is what happens if it's just okay, this is what happens if Daredevil/Jessica Jones/Luke Cage/Iron Fist is a huge hit and this is what happens if it isn't, etc."

But it was one of Marvel's least-successful titles.  I'm sure they made it for a reason and Scott/Hope have a big-isn part to play in Wave 3, but I would be SUUUPER surprised if Ant Man 2 happens any time soon."
marvelstudios,3dx39a,it_doesnt_matter88,4,Mon Jul 20 08:57:22 2015 UTC,Eh? It's been out for 3 days and is #1 at the box office having to compete with one of the biggest pop culture 'fads' of the decade (Minions) it's a bit early to say it's been the least successful.
marvelstudios,3dx39a,CountScarlioni,2,Mon Jul 20 09:22:50 2015 UTC,"Also, it was fairly cheap to make, compared to their other movies. The budget was only about $130 million, which it has already come close to making back internationally, and again, that's after only three days. It should have been expected that people wouldn't rush to the cinemas to see an obscure character with a power that people think is ""lame."" Everybody that I know has said that they will probably see it, but not right away. But with as much good press as it is getting, I am sure that it will begin to accumulate some interest."
marvelstudios,3dx39a,FalconLorenzo,2,Mon Jul 20 10:43:23 2015 UTC,By numbers it's been one of marvel's least successful opening weekends.  Only behind the hulk.
marvelstudios,3dx39a,Try_Another_Please,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:46:30 2015 UTC,But it's about the same success as all the other hero origins. It's kind of dumb to expect it to top sequels and team up movies. He has to be established just like everyone else. Plus it's cheaper so its not doing poorly at all. Marvel is smart enough to know all of this.

marvelstudios,3dx39a,o7mike,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:39:26 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. They could do a sequel that would be somewhat self contained, but (already knowing the future of MCU) throw in Easter eggs and mentions to the greater MCU in the current state of when the sequel would take place in.  Daredevil season two wasn't planned but they still green lit it and having knowledge of the direction the Defenders series is going in sure is in play as they write up the 2nd season. The real question isn't if they can do it, I'm sure they can... But do they want to do it?"

What if Marvel is worried about waiting too long to do a follow-up? I mean we've had sequels do disappointing business because allegedly there was too long a gap between entries. (See the last Star Trek movie coming 4 years after the successful Abrams reboot.)   2017 is not happening, but 2018? Possible...and it's by bumping Captain Marvel into '19 and take its November '18 date.   Before you say no way, Ant-Man sequel basically already has its cast and you have a creative team already assembled in Reed/Rudd, McKay maybe too depending if he's too busy with Inhumans by then. They obviously have an idea of what the should be about (getting Janet back, Microverse, etc.)   CM...not casted yet, no director, screenwriters recently hired are trying to work it out.

marvelstudios,3dyyss,TARDISd,8,Mon Jul 20 17:59:02 2015 UTC,"Front and center stage is a stretch... She was only in 4 scenes, her party, her bedroom, the last fight, and the dinner after. She was very much just a supporting character. I don't think that we will see the Young Avengers for at least 8 or 9 years."
marvelstudios,3dyyss,marvelking666,11,Mon Jul 20 18:01:44 2015 UTC,"No. She was only in a few scenes and nothing set up her getting powers in the future. If anything, all it set up was more Ant-Man movies."
marvelstudios,3dyyss,RedBarrel,-7,Mon Jul 20 17:56:47 2015 UTC,"She had huge supprting role, even the scenes she wasn't in she was repeatedly mentioned.

marvelstudios,3dyyss,RedBarrel,0,Mon Jul 20 18:01:52 2015 UTC,I think she might. I just don't think Ant-Man set it up. I would feel they had if they did something like make her small to hide her from Yellowjacket or if she had a line about how she wants to be a superhero too or something.
marvelstudios,3dyyss,mwriteword,4,Mon Jul 20 18:04:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. She is very young, and I think her prominence was to set up Scott's motivation rather than introducing her as a potential hero."

marvelstudios,3dut4j,PrimordialDragon,4,Mon Jul 20 16:38:47 2015 UTC,"IM3--Solid and takes risks, which it deserves credit for  AoS S1--Starts slow and cheesy, but proves its worth as it advances  TDW--Fun, but falls short of being great  TWS--Truly great, a well made blast to watch  GotG--Quirky, memorable, and sets itself apart nicely   AoS S2--Better than S1, Inhumans set up is exciting, lags around the end IMO   Agent Carter S1--It's good to see Carter herself back. Good, but not great  Daredevil--Feels like the MCU's answer to The Dark Knight and is amazing  AoU--Great, but doesn't top the first one (but what could?)   Ant Man--Like GotG, feels unique; great humor and characters   Overall, Phase 2 has better films than Phase 1, but is not better as a whole. When Phase 1 culminated into the Avengers, it felt complete--like the climax to an enormous mega movie. Phase 2, as a whole, just feels like a stepping stone to Infinity War."
marvelstudios,3dut4j,ThatGuyOnTheRoof,2,Mon Jul 20 05:01:20 2015 UTC,"Pretty much spot on to what I would say in regards to Phase 2.  GotG and TWS were probably my two favorite of all P2, but I totally lvoed Ant-Man.  It felt like a bit of fresh air as it was (no pun) a smaller more intimate movie.

If the TV shows count, Daredevil knocked out it of the friggin' park. Agent Carter was also excellent.  Agents of SHIELD is a lot better than it used to be but I don't think it's as good as Daredevil or even Agent Carter."

For IM3 and TDW, part of what was missing for me was the connectivity that wasn't yet answered. Like why didn't other avengers help when the kidnapped president or where was shield? A blink reference would have sufficed and I felt was needed after the Avengers. I believe TWS was the first film to top that of the Avengers, and it did resolve some of those questions without being obvious (targeting system on stark). After that we took a break from Earth with Guardians and Ultron pulled our team back together and I enjoyed it, but felt it had a middle of a trilogy filler vibe to it. Ant-Man was a complete origin story that explained why it was a solo outing and further built on what the phase had started."

Ferris Bueller oozed coolness. Peter is supposed to be nerdy, shy, and socially awkward. That's what I didn't like about Andrew Garfield. He was way too smooth to play a believable Peter."
marvelstudios,3dwhjc,the1egend1ives,3,Mon Jul 20 04:29:09 2015 UTC,"Well think about Peter from the spectacular spiderman cartoon. He was still totally nerdy and awkward when he needed to be, but most of the time played it cool and always had a good line to say whenever flash says something dumb. I think Garfield played it too awkward as Pete IMO, he was always stuttering and looking down, unless he was with gwen  Edit: I should rephrase though, he shouldn't go full Bueler, just make him a bit more confident and quippy to coincide with his awkwardness"

Gwen Stacy is the most beautiful girl in school but she has gasp hidden depths.  She likes science!  Mary Jane is the most beautiful new girl in school but she has gasp problems in her home life.  I know it sounds like I'm being sarcastic about it, but I genuinely think that will be the gist of the influence and also that it will be done very very well.  Most modern John Hughes inspired films seem old hat by now, but I have much faith in Marvel, and to be quite honest, his films probably drew influence from stories like Spider-man's high school arc."

I don't really hate Darcy per se, just a lot of the execution in her jokes as weak, so i feel like this may be a fault with the writers, honestly Thor 2 would have been much better imo without Darcy, i found it VERY weird how immediately after they showed Thor's mother's Funeral and Loki's ""death"", two very emotional scenes, they IMMEDIATELY cut to a comedic scene with no room to take in what just happened. Like how the hell am i supposed to laugh after the previous scene?"

He felt like a bad Spanish stereotype more than anything. I'm spanish so I don't know if I was being sorta off by that, but it seemed like the humor was mostly ""he talks with the goofy spanish voice"" like that one scene in 22 jump street. I was fine with it in jump street because the joke was ""look at how racist and bad at accents this white guy is"" but in antman it was just this persons character. I honestly felt embarrassed at most of his scenes."

I speak very quickly by default and I can gabble away at some speed, but I could barely understand the dialogue in his last ramble at the very end of the film, especially without the benefit of being able tp see him speaking."
marvelstudios,3dx8ud,baribigbird06,11,Mon Jul 20 07:58:21 2015 UTC,"The fatigue will only start if the quality goes down. As long as Marvel is putting out quality projects (and let's be honest, the worst film they've done so far is still moderately passable, not flat-out bad), there will be an audience for them.   It could be a real problem in the future, but for now I just think it's a media narrative. It's easy for websites to get clicks by writing think pieces about Marvel's imminent fall. In addition, because we've never had anything like this shared universe before, it feels oddly fragile to viewers and we worry about every new move (people were really worried about Guardians bombing, remember?). So we follow the news stories about it and our attention leads to even more stories being written.  I'm not discounting the idea that fatigue could be a real problem in the future, it's just that I don't feel it yet and think it mostly comes from needlessly worried fans and opportunistic journalists. (AoU's second highest opening ever was treated as a cause for concern--really?) Marvel has made missteps for sure, but the overall quality is very high and I don't think they've lost the trust of the viewers. So, I guess what I'm saying is, call me when there is solid evidence that the critical or box office numbers are on a downward trend. For now, I think we're fine, and I'm looking forward to Civil War."
marvelstudios,3dx8ud,Silverparachute,11,Mon Jul 20 08:23:50 2015 UTC,If they had put RDJ or Tom Hiddleston in the movie it would have made much more money. It has nothing to do with it being a superhero movies. It has to do with the fact that is an Ant-Man movie.  Completely unknown character with a stupid superpower.  GotG was also an unknown property. But at least it was a space movie and a special effects movie and the characters have interesting powers/looks.
marvelstudios,3dx8ud,Shadow_Gabriel,12,Mon Jul 20 08:59:34 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it was the fact that Guardians was hailed the ""next Star Wars"" that really engaged audiences."

If studios keep cycling out their characters and bringing new ones in, there shouldn;t be a problem.   Again, Marvel has proven that both standalone movies work and that they can shuffle up the genres. Guardians and Winter Soldier for example were released in the same year but totally different. If it weren't for Thanos or the Infinity Gems, you wouldn't be able to tell the two were linked."
marvelstudios,3dx8ud,TwitchyCookie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:10:34 2015 UTC,"If studios keep cycling out their characters and bringing new ones in, there shouldn;t be a problem.    I disagree. Unless Marvel changes things up, this will just expose how formulaic their movies are. A big part of the success of the movies is the huge names like Iron Man and Captain America. Ant-Man has shown that the Marvel brand alone isn't guaranteed to make a movie a smash hit."

marvelstudios,3dx8ud,freevo,3,Mon Jul 20 11:56:57 2015 UTC,"No Superhero fatigue will not occur, even if the quality dips. Think about how many truly stupid comedies come out every year or how many sappy Nicholas Sparks films that continue to be made. These don't get good reviews and don't excel at the box office yet they continue to come out every year in some way.   I know many people like to bring the western genre up when referring to the doom of superhero films. The difference here is Westerns died out because effects came around to help tell different stories. I don't see anything changing the game that much to bring the end of superhero movies."
marvelstudios,3dx8ud,freevo,6,Mon Jul 20 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"I think superhero movies are transitioning in the BCG matrix from 'Stars' to 'Cash Cows'. Which means that after a very fast ascension to the 1 billion-dollar blockbusters, they are now on their way to settle down on a more moderate revenue level.   With the more A-list stars slowly phasing out, the rest of this decade will introduce the lesser-known heroes like Black Panther and Captain Marvel etc. They, just like Ant-Man, will probably be way cheaper to make than an Avengers or even an Iron Man picture, and the studio won't expect revenues upwards of 500 million dollars from them. Just look at Ant-Man; its first-weekend revenue was 58 million dollars, but that's already half of the production costs. Marvel are not crying about those numbers at all.   Marvel are establishing themselves as a studio that delivers movies at a steady quality and frequency - that's what the audience will expect eventually. There are still going to be huge hits as there will be more Avengers movies, but they'll be less common."

marvelstudios,3dx8ud,plymouthpower,2,Mon Jul 20 20:23:46 2015 UTC,"It did very well for a film with a little known hero whom non-comic readers might find ridiculous. Not every movie is going to be huge. I doubt they expect the same numbers as the Avengers. The idea of burnout is generally propagated by critics who don't care for the idea of super hero movies in the first place. What they don't seem to get is that 'superhero' is an over-arching envelope for a collection of movies of different genres.  Hollywood repeats the same formula in many type of films--buddy movies, action movies which repeat virtually the same plot, romcoms--and no one talks about burnout there.  IMO, 'burnout' is shorthand of some fairly elitist thinking, that nothing from comic books can have sustainable quality and that people will eventually want to see 'real' films instead."

After seeing the film, you can tell where Edgar wanted to take it — make Rudd a more hardened character with a more difficult redemption arc — but I think the version we got was the perfect installation for the MCU and turned out to be one of the best Marvel movies of all time.

marvelstudios,3drfwl,Shadow_Gabriel,29,Sat Jul 18 19:20:11 2015 UTC,Indeed. We're talking about the guy wanted who pitched a Fantastic Four movie to be set in the 60's to Fox.
marvelstudios,3drfwl,TheDalekCaan,6,Sat Jul 18 20:57:57 2015 UTC,It wasn't actually set in the 60's. It's a common misconception since he'd been making Down With Love at the time which was set in the 60's. I've read the script for his FF movie and it was set and in the present and it was excellent. If Marvel eventually gets the rights back they really need Reed to reboot it.

marvelstudios,3drfwl,JNPR1996,32,Sun Jul 19 20:18:07 2015 UTC,"Yes. Wright wouldn't have explored Wasp, the microverse, and apparently he would have pushed Pym from the spotlight a bunch.  All of these are major parts of Ant-man, and even if Wright had directed a very well done visual comedy I can guarantee fans would be complaining or asking for more of those."
marvelstudios,3drfwl,silvershadow881,9,Sat Jul 18 20:55:17 2015 UTC,"Not really, Wright would've made a good film that still would've been great.  Also as you say at the end, fans are the best Marvel filmmakers, and it shouldn't be forgotten that Wright is a major fan of Ant-Man, specifically Scott Lang. I mean he'd made the script of his own volition years ago, then got hired because of it, and only left because his vision clashed with Marvel's.  Plus we don't really know how much each character would've been in the film. In the end it's all a 'What if' scenario, but it's equally bad to claim Wright's would've been better or worse than Reed's."
marvelstudios,3drfwl,Gamb1993,5,Sun Jul 19 00:34:08 2015 UTC,"I think Wright's version would have probably been just as good, although maybe just a little different."
marvelstudios,3drfwl,metalkhaos,2,Sun Jul 19 03:22:34 2015 UTC,I think Wright's distinct visual style would've pushed Ant-Man to #1 for me. I love all the Marvel movies but visually they just fit within the house style. I'd like to see future movies more akin to different artists taking over a book.

It comes down to the reasons I think we already know for why it didn't work out. Edgar Wright's Ant-Man would've been a great Edgar Wright movie, but it wouldn't have been a great Marvel movie. I'm more than happy with the film we got."
marvelstudios,3drfwl,sdesaulniers,32,Sun Jul 19 08:31:29 2015 UTC,"Edgar Wright would've given us a very different movie, and it probably would've been great, but it wouldn't have been this movie.  I figure in an alternate universe, a bunch of people are thoroughly enjoying Wright's version of the film but lamenting that it didn't really fit with the rest of the MCU."
marvelstudios,3drfwl,ZacPensol,9,Sat Jul 18 21:57:35 2015 UTC,I thought you could see very definite marks of both Wright and Reed at various points in the movie and that in spite of all the upheaval behind the scenes the total finished product was immensely better than I expected from either director individually.

marvelstudios,3dqncs,upgraiden,53,Sat Jul 18 16:30:36 2015 UTC,"Some movies are just objectively bad, and should be treated as such. Reviews can turn people away from bad movies like Annabelle, and instead turn attention to movies like Nightcrawler, that might not get much attention otherwise.

In Daredevil's case, there are a few factors that pushed it down. The most obvious one is how often the violence got to the point of being grotesque.  But more for me, one of the big reasons I enjoy the MCU so much is the interconnectedness of it. It's the only franchise of its kind to appear on film, every other kind of anthology was either fixed in scope (like Doctor Who or James Bond), fixed in length (like so many franchises in the past), or entries were self-contained (like Star Trek). While Daredevil's setup might pay off yet (particular the mystical bits that will certainly be explored in Iron Fist and Doctor Strange), at the moment it stands far too alone for my liking. What interconnectedness was there felt more like cute little nods, like the Chitauri Invasion of New York being called ""The Incident"", or Matt references growing up in the same orphanage as Skye, or past films' events seen as newspaper clippings in Ulrich's office. Compared to the more obvious crossovers in Agents of SHIELD, or Agent Carter setting up HYDRA's resurgence or exploring Black Widow's background, Daredevil was much more independent. I understand why some people might like that, but I feel like such independence takes away from why the MCU is interesting in the first place."

The one thing that disappointed me about Daredevil is it had a lot more screentime, yet only managed to develop the titular characters and their surroundings. It definitely feels like a sub-level of interconnectivity in the MCU that I'm sure the rest of the Netflix shows will latch onto as hard as possible to remain relevant.  Side note, why was Sky left in that orphanage? Her parents were living really far away, and we have no idea what Mr Hyde/jeckle  was up to that left him to leave her at that orphanage. Seems a little forced, just to have her grow up in New York."

They completely ignore the fact that most of the destruction was caused by Zod and the others. They also fail to criticize Age of Ultron for the same thing - It was literally Tony Stark's creation that led to a city being ripped apart from Earth, and at the end of the movie, no one gives a fuck. But there's nothing but praise for Age of Ultron on here.

Not for lack of marketing, not for lack of big names, not for lack of budget. Films should suffer when they are bad, and be successful when they are good. A world that pays no attention to reviews is one where production companies don't make movies they make trailers and posters."

marvelstudios,3dqncs,inorganicangelrosiel,30,Sat Jul 18 15:19:05 2015 UTC,"I think it comes from the fact that we're dealing with an irreverent character here that isn't going to bring in the crowds on name value alone.  also, the desire to protect marvel studios' record is probably part of the reasoning here. I'm happy that its rating went up as it really is a great movie. I hope it gets enough positive word of mouth to get a sequel."
marvelstudios,3dqncs,TARDISd,23,Sat Jul 18 15:57:24 2015 UTC,I don't know if it's about protecting a record as it is people (especially critics) that are circling like sharks for a Marvel flop.

That movie currently sits on a 98%.  Edit: Downvotes huh?

marvelstudios,3dqncs,TripleSkeet,2,Sat Jul 18 22:16:04 2015 UTC,"Everyone loves the Marvel movies these days. Critics love to be the first one to say ""The Emperor has no clothes!""

And then it triples its budget and overall the public love it."
marvelstudios,3dqncs,MondayAssasin,6,Sun Jul 19 03:16:49 2015 UTC,I don't understand how some people freak out when niche Marvel characters get movies. Just because they're not known to the general public doesn't mean they aren't interesting.
marvelstudios,3dqncs,OnBenchNow,3,Sat Jul 18 16:20:19 2015 UTC,"But that's the point. We know they're interesting, but Marvel is still taking a big risk spending millions upon millions to bring these characters to life. If these big risk movies fail, it deters Marvel from trying other risky properties. If Guardians had failed, we probably would not have gotten Ant-Man."
marvelstudios,3dqncs,MondayAssasin,3,Sat Jul 18 22:56:03 2015 UTC,"You have a point, but I'm more talking about the Marvel fanbase that think a movie will suck just because there's a talking raccoon and tree or a man who shrinks. The main four heroes are all a man wearing an iron suit, a Norse God wielding a hammer, a man who turns into a green monster when he's angry, and a man who's been frozen for 70 years. Just because they're more grounded in reality doesn't mean they're not pretty silly when you take a good look at them. Basically, keep an open mind, it's a superhero universe, not everything's gonna be super serious."
marvelstudios,3dqncs,OnBenchNow,2,Sat Jul 18 23:25:30 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for everybody, but I don't think most fans think the movie will suck, I think they think general audiences will think ""ant man? laaaame"" or ""ummmm who the guardians of te Galaxy?"" and just won't see it."
marvelstudios,3dqncs,TripleSkeet,2,Sun Jul 19 02:46:05 2015 UTC,Its not like they spend the same amount of money they do on like The Avengers. Ant Man doesnt have to make a billion dollars to be considered a success.

marvelstudios,3dqncs,Fripples,9,Sun Jul 19 00:54:50 2015 UTC,"It's just tribal, like rooting for a sports team.  Fans want to see their franchise ""win"" by getting great reviews, big box office, etc."
marvelstudios,3dqncs,kaimason1,8,Sat Jul 18 16:01:15 2015 UTC,"That said, RT is probably the best gauge out there for general consensus, for whatever that's worth.   While I do 100% agree here, I would like to point out that RT works very differently from other ratings sites, since I feel a lot of people don't really understand this (which probably played a role in people freaking out over the early 65%). Rather than being a traditional score like Metacritic where it's number is an average of all scores, RT's number is really only a percentage of people who ""liked"" (i.e., rated it over some threshold) the movie. This does mean a movie with a 70% on RT could only have 70% of people thinking it was just barely over that threshold while 30% think it's absolute horse shit, which would result in a much lower score on a more traditional site like Metacritic. Meanwhile a movie sitting at 30% could have 70% of people thinking it was just ok but not quite good enough to pass that ""like"" threshold and the other 30% thinking it was the best goddamn movie of all time, which would of course lead to a much higher Metascore. So Ant-Man sitting at 65% early on just meant that quite a few of the people who went to see it early on and rated it (in other words, mainly movie critics) didn't much like it (movie critics generally don't like superhero stuff as much), and now that the general American public is seeing it a much higher percentage of people are positively reacting to it (as should be expected for superhero films)."
marvelstudios,3dqncs,TARDISd,3,Sat Jul 18 17:50:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Good explanation, too!"
marvelstudios,3dqncs,notevaluatedbyFDA,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:59:01 2015 UTC,The rating that is currently sitting at 79% is the critic's consensus. Audience rating doesn't affect that score.

Typically I'd agree with you but for things like this I see why people do care. If you REALLY like something and then it doesn't do well then you're not likely to see any more of it. Knowing what others think and how well the movie is doing gives a good indication on if we'll be seeing a sequel.
marvelstudios,3dqncs,TARDISd,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:11:44 2015 UTC,"I guess I should clarify - I don't let others' impressions affect my perception. That makes more sense. But even then, critics don't make or break franchises, ticket sales do. That's why F4 is actually happening."

marvelstudios,3dqncs,PlatFleece,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:23:46 2015 UTC,"Y'know I've always been curious what counts as a bomb in films. Like, when can a movie be judged if it's a bomb or not? After the first week? Is it only if it doesn't make a profit? What if it makes a profit after a 6 weeks in the theater but then isn't shown anymore?  -Curious Redditor"
marvelstudios,3dqncs,TripleSkeet,2,Sun Jul 19 14:21:15 2015 UTC,"Its based on how much money it makes. The thing is, its very rare that a movie makes MORE money as time goes on. So after its first weekend, you can sometimes guess where it will end. If it dopesnt make its budget back? MAJOR bomb. Good chance they never make a sequel. If it makes its money back and a little more? Not a success but not a huge failure either. If it makes back double its budget or more? Success."

I'm not saying it was the perfect movie, but reviewers are being a little stingy.  Viewers have it at 92%. If anything I'd go off of that if I took RT scores into account."
marvelstudios,3dqncs,JustinC00,17,Sat Jul 18 16:00:28 2015 UTC,"It really should be 85-90% on RT.  Critics that are Edgar Wright fanboys (or at least that's how their review reads) effected the rating.  So basically coming into it Ant-Man was at negative 5-10% because some critics were going to give it a negative review regardless if it was good or not because and I actually did see this quote in a review, ""this was suppose to be Edgar Wright's Ant-Man, he was working on it for 10 years and Marvel screwed him at the last minute because they never wanted him to do his version they wanted him to do MCU's Ant-Man and they were just trying to use Edgar Wright for his name because Paul Rudd isn't bringing people to the theaters"""
marvelstudios,3dqncs,Worthyness,16,Sat Jul 18 16:51:04 2015 UTC,"I hate the Edgar Wright stuff because most likely people will complement the good portions for being ""egar wright's genius"" and all the shit parts to Marvel/Peyton reeds fault.

I do agree, it should have been higher as I walked away from the movie last night with it instantly becoming my new favorite MCU film. Yes, there were elements that didn't work (the villain), but man if I wasn't consistently laughing or sitting in shock throughout the movie."
marvelstudios,3dqncs,Astrokiwi,3,Sat Jul 18 22:54:52 2015 UTC,"RottenTomatoes just has a different scale than what we're used to. We see a 50% score and we assume the movie must be terrible, but RT actually uses the whole scale from 0 to 100, so 50% is still actually maybe worth watching. We're used to 90% being pretty good, 80% being not great, and 70% being barely worth watching, so we have a reaction against the low scores on RT even though they're pretty self-consistent.  Age of Ultron, Jurassic World, and Ant-man, all got in the 70-80% range. On the RT scale, that means a ""good movie""."
marvelstudios,3dqncs,entertainman,2,Sat Jul 18 19:30:54 2015 UTC,"No no no.  The number is percent of positive reviews.  So if every critic gave it a 2/4 but rated it fresh, it would have 100% even though it's average score is 50%  The RT score is not very related to the average score."
marvelstudios,3dqncs,Astrokiwi,2,Sat Jul 18 23:32:47 2015 UTC,"Right, but the result of that is a generally much greater spread of scores than individual reviewers would give"

marvelstudios,3dqncs,HeavenPiercingMan,18,Sat Jul 18 18:35:21 2015 UTC,"This confirms my theory: Angry critics who still can't get over Wright's departure rushed to spill their salt as soon as possible to attack the movie/compare it to ""what could have been"" and act as if the movie automatically became worse than Batman & Robin and Marvel is so Evil™ because everybody knows Disney is Evil™ too and Satan Feige just wants slaves with no personal creativity."

Sometimes there's an embargo, sometimes critics just haven't written the reviews yet, sometimes it's just not registered to Rotten Tomatoes yet. There won't be a clear idea of where the critics are going with the movie until about 50-75 reviews have been calculated into the Tomato Meter. Even then, things can change."

marvelstudios,3dtm33,FranzisP,17,Sun Jul 19 09:41:37 2015 UTC,Agent Carter Season 2 for sure. Can never have enough Peggy.
marvelstudios,3dtm33,RadiantViper,14,Sun Jul 19 10:30:07 2015 UTC,Movie: Doctor Strange. Why? Just look at this.  Tv show: Iron Fist. I'm really curious how will they portray his chi powers.
marvelstudios,3dtm33,Shadow_Gabriel,5,Sun Jul 19 10:56:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't expect Iron Fist next year, seems like it'll just be Daredevil Season 2 and Luke Cage Season 1, plus possibly more Jessica Jones. Iron Fist will likely be 2017, unless they've made more progress than we know of."
marvelstudios,3dtm33,charlie2094,3,Sun Jul 19 12:08:28 2015 UTC,"Unless they start filming Iron Fist in Oct/Nov, them I don't expect to see Fist on netflix next year. It's usually 5-6 months of production then 6 months of post."

I was looking forward to Season 1 more than Avengers this year, and for me, it's the best thing Marvel have made thus far, just above Winter Soldier. Daredevil is also my favorite Marvel character so with how great Season 1 was, kind of a given...not to mention the addition of Elektra and Punisher.  Doctor Strange is just behind this. Love, love, the early Stan Lee and Steve Ditko Doctor Strange stories, has a lot of potential on screen if they really go all out with the weird, surreal nature of the art. Plus he has a great origin, great cast so far and will finally introduce magic and the supernatural."
marvelstudios,3dtm33,charlie2094,10,Sun Jul 19 10:38:54 2015 UTC,"I know it's later this year, but I'm most psyched about Jessica Jones.  ALIAS is one of the best comic series ever written, imo; and after seeing what was done with DD, I can't wait for JJ."

marvelstudios,3dtm33,kingsguarding,29,Mon Jul 20 08:01:02 2015 UTC,Doctor Strange.  The MCU will never be the same again:   First movie without an origin One of the most powerful and unique characters Arugable the largest actor the join the MCU with a lead role Introducing magic and supernatural.
marvelstudios,3dtm33,TwitchyCookie,29,Sun Jul 19 09:49:09 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty certain Doctor Strange will have an origin story, don't believe those reports hold any weight, especially when Feige has said things like ""With Strange, it is a classic Marvel origin story because he’s got one of the best origins ever""...maybe it won't be told in the usual linear way, but it'll certainly have an origin."
marvelstudios,3dtm33,charlie2094,-1,Sun Jul 19 10:47:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it was just Faraci saying the whole ""no origin story"" thing, and his credibility has been shot to zero by now."
marvelstudios,3dtm33,tombobbishop,3,Sun Jul 19 16:13:07 2015 UTC,"Faraci hasn't actually been wrong about anything regarding Marvel thus far and has in fact gotten the jump on a lot of things, such as Carol Danvers once having a cameo appearance at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron.  Plus, he didn't say that Doctor Strange won't have an origin story at all, just that we won't have one in the traditional sense like other  Marvel movies or as Faraci put it, like Batman Begins.  Point is, we're probably going to see flashbacks to his origin, but as the movie begins he already knows how to use his powers. Sort of like how Daredevil technically didn't have an origin story, but had it shown through flashbacks throughout the series.  Plus, we're already seeing Marvel getting around origin stories already with Black Panther appearing in full costume in Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man already being an active hero.  Marvel Studios just seems to be moving away from how origin story are traditionally told, which seems to be the case."
marvelstudios,3dtm33,Flamma_Man,4,Sun Jul 19 23:54:41 2015 UTC,"Faraci said, ""Marvel's new thing is no more origin stories. So, Dr. Strange movie no longer has an origin.""  That sounds pretty definite to me, and also almost certainly wrong.  He also claimed that Cap wasn't going to be in Infinity War, and unless Chris Evans is taking part in a really lengthy bluff where he's pretending that he's signed on for it, that also seems to be almost certainly wrong.  And Faraci also claimed that Marvel was planning to trade the rights to Daredevil for Galactus to Fox, which was definitely wrong.  I'll admit that saying Faraci has no credibility was a bit unfair of me.  But he's been wrong enough times to warrant taking his stories with a huge grain of salt."

Sure, he's got some unfortunate crazy fans, and he's not quite a household name, but he's a well established actor."
marvelstudios,3dtm33,marvelking666,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:58:38 2015 UTC,"I guess the point is he is less known than RDJ was at the time he was brought in, and you're right about those things but they aren't as hugely popular as someone like Brad Pitt was or like Samuel L. Jackson is."

marvelstudios,3dtm33,JuanRiveara,5,Sun Jul 19 13:07:18 2015 UTC,Brother Voodoo will be in it!   You might be confusing him with Chiwetel Ejiofor's character Baron Mordo.

Doctor Strange definitely leads the list, with Jessica Jones is a very close second. I really enjoy Kristen Ritter's work and as the first female titular superhero in the MCU, it's got a lot of hype from me. Agents of SHIELD season 3 is third, then it's probably a tie between Civil War and Agent Carter for fourth."

Right now, I trust Marvel to do their characters justice and to not take risks that won't pan out.  Worked for GotG. Worked for Ant-Man. I think that they wouldn't do a Dr. Strange movie unless they had a great way to fit him into the MCU and a great concept.   So, yeah. I'm excited. I just wish he was one of the Defenders. Instead of it being 'street-level heroes', I'd rather see it be a weird group of heroes like the comics: Hulk, Dr. Strange, Luke Cage, and Hellcat. (All of which will be part of the MCU.)  I mean, Civil War's going to be great. But Marvel seems to knock it out of the park when they take risks."

I wasn't crystal clear on that."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,TheBandIsRedHeaven,14,Sat Jul 18 23:00:35 2015 UTC,"That's because most of the movie sacrificed cohesion for a brisker pace.

marvelstudios,3drg2j,ikeaborn,7,Sat Jul 18 23:09:08 2015 UTC,"You gotta cut AoU a little slack. Joss Whedon was saddled with being all things to all people with this movie, and everyone wants everything. We want cohesion with previous and future movies, but we want new material as well. We want lots of strong scenes with the classic Avengers, but we want strong scenes with new ones too. We want lots of mind-blowing special effects but we also want good dialogue. We want a lot of character development but we also want a lot of explosions and lasers. We want great comedy but we also want lots of drama and tension. We want tons of comic book references that only nerds will notice, but we want it to be accessible to people for whom this is their first Marvel movie.   The biggest complaint I heard from most critics was ""it moves a bit too fast."" Bear in mind, making a 2.5 hour movie feel like it's moving too fast is often considered to be gold-level storytelling, because it's usually the other way around.  No matter how Age of Ultron turned out, there were so many demands from so many people, there's always going to be something people can nit-pick and complain about. But overall, Whedon did one hell of a fine job of giving everyone what they were looking for."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,TheBandIsRedHeaven,4,Sat Jul 18 23:11:43 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind, making a 2.5 hour movie feel like it's moving too fast is often considered to be gold-level storytelling.   If we look at some of the better 3 hour movies, the idea is that if you don't feel the length of the movie while watching it, it has succeeded.  In Hollywood, this is specially true, because for the most part there is less of a care for story and more for the commercial value of the product.  However, because your quote was out of any context, I'm going to have to disagree and say that a lot of movies would benefit from having at least a slow to start pace. No one wants to see the pacing of a hollywood movie drag down to a halt before it ends, because it breaks momentum, but the movie should not be afraid to take its time establishing itself."

Kebbel is a solid actor who did great as Koba in DoPotA though he wasn't the most articulate bad guy, I believe Doom will be far from the worst part of the movie.   But yes I would love for Doom to be in the MCU but I don't see him fitting in the current Phase 3 lineup except for maybe Civil War or Black Panther. He would be a great villain to start setting up in Phase 4 though."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,JuanRiveara,21,Sun Jul 19 02:13:15 2015 UTC,"Fox, it's that they mishandle Dr DOOM on every outing   They've done it once so far.

marvelstudios,3drg2j,lmo2th,12,Sat Jul 18 19:39:46 2015 UTC,"They've done it once so far.   Twice, but yeah.   At least wait until the new movie is actually out before coming to conclusions about Doom in it   This is always good advice."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,TheBandIsRedHeaven,6,Sat Jul 18 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"Your comment is contradictory. You say they've mishandled Doom twice, but then say wait till the new movie. I am dum."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,junglemonkey47,8,Sat Jul 18 22:36:20 2015 UTC,I'm referring to two different movies. The first and second F4.  I don't know if they mishandled him in the new movie. Neither does anyone else.
marvelstudios,3drg2j,TheBandIsRedHeaven,5,Sat Jul 18 23:30:04 2015 UTC,Oh fuck there was a second FF. That's right. I'm dumb.
marvelstudios,3drg2j,junglemonkey47,6,Sat Jul 18 23:31:41 2015 UTC,Haha. It's ok. :)
marvelstudios,3drg2j,TheBandIsRedHeaven,4,Sat Jul 18 23:34:34 2015 UTC,The Fox FF movies have been so bad you've blotted them out of your memory.
marvelstudios,3drg2j,rjung,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:54:14 2015 UTC,There was an unreleased FF movie (Rodger Corman made it in 1990 I think) that was horrible as well. I think you could buy VHS copies of it at conventions. Doom was horrible in the clips I've seen  of that as well.
marvelstudios,3drg2j,captainpostal,8,Sun Jul 19 01:07:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have agreed with you to such a high degree if it wasn't for how one-dimensional Darren Cross was in Ant-Man. I would have cared a little bit more if they had a flashback or something to the time when Pym chose him as his running mate in all things science. I get it, you want your vengeance against the man you couldn't please, yada yada yada.  Doom would be a fresh face for the MCU. But I am not convinced that they don't have at least a few memorable and believable villains stocked away for future appearances."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,number1lakeboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:01:20 2015 UTC,I agree. They definitely should've shown him before the particles started messing with his brain

I would rather see the MCU continue to raise the status of other villains.  Doesn't mean I don't want to see a good Doom.  Maybe one day."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,Friendly_B,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:50:55 2015 UTC,Totally read that in the voice of Doom. :)

marvelstudios,3drg2j,Friendly_B,4,Sun Jul 19 01:48:27 2015 UTC,They could also stop killing off so many villains. Is arresting them that unrealistic?
marvelstudios,3drg2j,mythmaster,4,Sun Jul 19 03:05:38 2015 UTC,"""Every outing""  So you mean that one time?"
marvelstudios,3drg2j,raysweater,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:17:38 2015 UTC,Three outings by my count:   The Fantastic Four (1994) Fantastic Four (2005) Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007)   And who are we kidding? We already know from the trailers Doom looks like crap in the new one.
marvelstudios,3drg2j,captainpostal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:53:22 2015 UTC,No one saw that first one you brought up because it was never in theaters and I counted the other two as the same since it was the same version of him.  But I agree he's gonna suck in the new one too.
marvelstudios,3drg2j,raysweater,5,Mon Jul 20 01:10:07 2015 UTC,Yep.

marvelstudios,3drg2j,MasterOE,2,Sun Jul 19 13:21:24 2015 UTC,I want either Norman Osborn or Doom as the next big bad after Thanos is dealt with.
marvelstudios,3drg2j,batmanzc,3,Sat Jul 18 19:34:01 2015 UTC,"I really don't find Doom interesting. The ""I'm gonna rule you"" trope is over-played. They can make virtually any villain a lot stronger so they don't need Doom. I can't wait to see Thanos. He'll be barreling through the Avengers, shaking off the strongest ones. It's going to be great."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,ashtonknapp,2,Sat Jul 18 21:24:22 2015 UTC,"Doom is a character where there it is the ""it's not broke so don't fix it"" thing.  He's the original Darth Vader.  We know that kind of character can be successful.  Doctor Doom as Doctor Doom would make a really good antagonist.  However, Fox seem to think they can ""fix it"" and they end up breaking it.  They didn't need to change Doom, but they keep doing it.  I don't understand why they would take something that surely would not be hard to get wrong and then get it wrong."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,neonrideraryeh,2,Sat Jul 18 22:43:21 2015 UTC,"It's not the fact that the villains aren't threatening (well it sorta is), it's the fact that they aren't getting development as characters."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,PrematureSquirt,2,Sat Jul 18 23:52:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like the only person on this sub who wants Marvel to have the F4 rights because I actually like the Fantastic Four, not just their villians. I mean, they definitely do have some great villains, but I'd be so upset if they got the F4 rights back only for Doom, Galactus, etc. I love the Fantastic Four, and they deserve a good movie done right, imo :("
marvelstudios,3drg2j,kingsguarding,6,Sun Jul 19 05:18:48 2015 UTC,Since when does Marvel keep screwing up its villains? It's got some pretty epic and awesome villains in its history so far.
marvelstudios,3drg2j,TheBandIsRedHeaven,22,Sun Jul 19 12:00:59 2015 UTC,"This has been one of the largest and most consistent criticisms of Marvel's films, even coming from big fans of the series."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,ClintBartonHawkguy,2,Sat Jul 18 20:04:45 2015 UTC,It's honestly become a circlejerk at this point. I'm sick of it.
marvelstudios,3drg2j,prophetofgreed,2,Sat Jul 18 20:38:52 2015 UTC,"How is it a circlejerk? Villains are without a doubt one of Marvel's weakest points, it's not even debatable."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,Esfer25,-1,Sun Jul 19 02:35:14 2015 UTC,"A circlejerk implies it's a good thing, or complimentary."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,resultsmayvary0,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:34:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe, maybe not... but I know some fantastic Marvel villains have graced the screen. Some weren't so terrific, but come on. Loki? Winter Soldier? Ultron? Even with Incredible Hulk's iffy third act, Tim Roth tore a hole in the screen as Emil Blonsky. And even smaller villains (who might get bigger later) like Thunderbolt Ross or Klau are pretty nicely crafted. Marvel may have some inconsistencies (obviously Malekith and Yellowjacket were not particularly impressive), but ""screwed up"" villains are hardly a chronic problem.  That having been said, I'd love to see Doom return to Marvel. Try as they might, Fox just doesn't see the value in drawing from the source material. I'm not saying I won't like what I see in the new F4 reboot, but I miss the allure of that towering, majestic sadist."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,TheBandIsRedHeaven,13,Sun Jul 19 15:26:50 2015 UTC,"Huh, I think Yellowjacket is getting a lot of undeserved flak.  I cannot fathom how anybody could list Ultron was a good example of a villain, then say that Yellowjacket was one of the worst so far in that universe.  He was infinitely better than Ultron, for me."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,ScaredycatMatt,5,Sat Jul 18 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"Huh, I think Yellowjacket is getting a lot of undeserved flak.   I think he is too, because at this point, weak villains is the biggest criticism of Marvel, so people will immediately think of and go to that first."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,junglemonkey47,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:17:44 2015 UTC,"There's a pretty broad range of opinions, of course. And everyone is entitled to them. That having been said, when you're trying to ascertain ""good villain or not?"" you actually have very little objective criteria to go on. You didn't like Ultron? I don't have a problem with that. But I'm not sure that's a failure on Marvel's part.  I don't think Yellowjacket was a Shakespearian-level character, but I thought Corey Stoll put his everything into it. He looked great, fired lots of lasers, and did some killing. I liked him."

marvelstudios,3drg2j,ManofManyTalentz,7,Sat Jul 18 22:34:32 2015 UTC,"2 words : 13 hours.   You're comparing Cinematic Apples to Television oranges. If Netflix made a 2-hour Daredevil movie instead of a 13-episode series, we would all be whining about how one-dimensional the Kingpin was.   Nowadays, in the Era of Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, and Breaking Bad, TV can tell stories movies can't. I hope that Marvel keeps expanding their TV universe so we can get more of this awesomeness."

marvelstudios,3drg2j,1of7billion,2,Sun Jul 19 03:26:39 2015 UTC,Cal? Jaiying? MCU television actually has some pretty decent villains that are both sympathetic and fleshed out.
marvelstudios,3drg2j,Gremzero,2,Sun Jul 19 19:19:30 2015 UTC,Cal is pretty much the pinnacle of antagonists and how his story played out. Really big round of applause for that work.
marvelstudios,3drg2j,1of7billion,4,Sun Jul 19 21:11:33 2015 UTC,"I think the issue with Marvels villains is that they are good but don't have enough time to develop. I've had an interest in almost every villain they've put up, most are acted very well and given some sympathetic points but they don't last very long."
marvelstudios,3drg2j,Elementium,3,Sun Jul 19 21:35:28 2015 UTC,I don't know if that's a fair assessment. The movies aren't particularly longer or shorter than other movies of the same kind.
marvelstudios,3drg2j,TheBandIsRedHeaven,4,Sat Jul 18 23:09:05 2015 UTC,True but I think the focus is more heavily on the heroes because they need to be good for future movies.
marvelstudios,3drg2j,Elementium,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:10:58 2015 UTC,Other movies of the same kind aren't exactly swimming in memorable villains either. It's not just a problem with Marvel movies. It's a problem with action movies.

marvelstudios,3drg2j,jdyake,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:00:36 2015 UTC,"The ""adult"" oriented shows/movies like Daredevil has really complicated and sympathetic ""villains"". Because the demographic demands complex characters and it adds many elements that the hero will most likely not offer to the demographic. Selfish/greedy acts etc. Things that mature people will ask themselves ""Would I do the same thing in his/her shoe?"".  Marvel studios, is clearly targeted for family/everyone. They try to aim for the maximum return of investment. And also... merchandising, which are for kids and younger people.   Hence, the villain and hero battle is usually ""simplified"". They try to give some subtle ""gray"" areas, but to the eyes of the younger audiences, they can tell who the good guy and bad guy is... fleshed out in 2 hours and a bit.   Dr.Doom, if Marvel ever gets him back, can be treated like what they did with Loki. A recurring villain... mainly because Dr.Doom can be vital as the anti-hero super-hero depending on the story arc and if there is a bigger threat that also goes against Dr.Doom's agendas... like Thanos or a Galactus.  I think Fox knows this... Disney could pony-up and offer 1 billion+ dollars and Fox will say yes. But anything under and you see Fox hanging up. And if they do agree (Fox), they will force Disney to allow them to leech off a percentage or two in box office profits using any of the FF and affiliates.   Basically, Fox surrendering FF and the rest of the characters will cost Disney a huge chunk of dollars.  Marvel/Disney are proud, so they will probably rather develop a villain from their stable rather than let Fox win.  With SONY on the wagon, I think Marvel will rather develop and focus on the following villains... who has potential to be re-occurring or villains that appear on multiple movies.   The Mandarin Dr.Octopus Dormammu Ultron (can still come back, his ""death"" wasnt clear and besides he is an A.I)   But besides Dr.Doom, I want Silver Surfer, Galactus from Fox. They will significantly help the cosmic side of MCU. Especially after seeing the celestial... and Thanos technically has no competition... he could defeat the Avengers very easily... Prime Odin is the only one who can defeat Thanos. But adding Silver Surfer to a team like the Guardians of the Galaxy along Adam Warlock would allow Marvel to have Thanos actually fight superheroes and make it last longer than a couple of minutes.  Infinity War with Thanos and the gauntlet should be a breeze for Thanos... I fully expect an intervention from his ally (Gamora) or a higher powered hero that helps the heroes overcome him."

marvelstudios,3ds33p,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:22:01 2015 UTC,Yea I think Vision was the best new hero in phase 2. Paul Bettany was born to play that role.

marvelstudios,3dwcxz,At0mic_Banjo,7,Mon Jul 20 02:09:32 2015 UTC,I believe James Gunn has said multiple times Carol Danvers won't be in GGV2 and that Star Lord will remain the only human. If her solo movie is post IW1 than I expect her to first appear in IW1.
marvelstudios,3dwcxz,JuanRiveara,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:04:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe she could be a fighter pilot and she gets caught in the accident that powers her, making her ""The Vision"" of Infinity War 1 essentially, that way, you can get the BS out of the way for the solo film."
marvelstudios,3dwcxz,JNPR1996,3,Mon Jul 20 04:59:23 2015 UTC,"I recall hearing somewhere that Feige said that Captain Marvel's powers are cosmic, but her movie will center very much on Earth."
marvelstudios,3dwcxz,OrangeFeels,4,Mon Jul 20 02:29:07 2015 UTC,"He essentially said her origins were of earth, and that she'd balance the two."
marvelstudios,3dwcxz,JNPR1996,2,Mon Jul 20 02:35:30 2015 UTC,We will meet Carol Danvers before the Captain Marvel movie. I don't think she will have powers until her solo film.
marvelstudios,3dwcxz,Remi15,2,Mon Jul 20 06:24:38 2015 UTC,Well Kevin Fiege did say that Ant-Man would be Marvel's last origin story so either she starts with powers or she gets her powers in another movie before hers.
marvelstudios,3dx6c3,kgold77,17,Mon Jul 20 07:22:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna argue opinions or anything, but I always find it odd that if someone doesn't like the humour it's labelled as ""forced""."
marvelstudios,3dx6c3,DanHero91,-3,Mon Jul 20 07:33:05 2015 UTC,"I mean forced as in forgettable, insert quip here type stuff. It didn't seem natural.

marvelstudios,3dx6c3,SuckaFreeBaust,3,Mon Jul 20 15:21:57 2015 UTC,"I personally enjoyed the movie because it was entertaining.  The only thing that bothered was the acting of some of the characters. For example, Paul had almost no expression on his face in certain scenes. He had that ""I'm looking far away"" or ""I'm thinking about something"" look on his face"
marvelstudios,3dx6c3,FerPalacios93,3,Mon Jul 20 10:35:05 2015 UTC,"Haha and its Paul Rudd, it's hard to not think its all a big joke (usually in a good way) when he's on screen. I think he'll be dope in a team up and I can't wait to see what he adds to the avengers."

marvelstudios,3dx6c3,74three1989,-3,Mon Jul 20 07:28:09 2015 UTC,Then maybe I thought it wasn't a joke because it was actually funny. Haha alright I'm being a bit of a hater I just really didn't vibe with it very much.
marvelstudios,3dx6c3,errantknight1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:39:40 2015 UTC,"I didn't expect much going into the movie, but I enjoyed it. Solid, forgettable summer flick in a week or two for me. I didn't think the humor was forced, but the jokes were hit and miss.   The opening scene with a de-aged Michael Douglas was way too intense for a movie with a light hearted tone.  Yellowjacket was an underdeveloped villain (as usual for most Marvel movies).  The pacing of the film was balanced, but I found a lot of the plot points to be either forced, predictable, or illogical.  Michael Pena was hilariously. The dynamic between Hank Pym and Hope was the emotional centerpiece of the movie. Paul Rudd has great comedic timing as usual."
marvelstudios,3dx6c3,errantknight1,0,Mon Jul 20 07:49:49 2015 UTC,"I suppose i was looking for way too much in this movie. I mean how do you dodge the long backstory and becoming-a-hero montage? I just feel like this is a studio who brought us the winter soldier, and they can come up with something more compelling than 'this is cool super developed technology and one guys gonna use it for good against the guy who is trying to mass weaponize it'  like really I don't even give a shit about the humor I don't even know why I brought it up, but yeah Michael Pena and TI were killing it and had some good moments. Can we talk about how he escapes the subatomic zone? It really seemed a little too easy."
marvelstudios,3dx6c3,errantknight1,0,Mon Jul 20 08:35:59 2015 UTC,"this is cool super developed technology and one guys gonna use it for good against the guy who is trying to mass weaponize it >    So Iron Man?  Just kidding but we all have different opinions and I respect that as long as you dont bash it just to bash it or say it is a bad movie because Edgar Wright did not direct it.  Personally I loved the movie but you are entitled to your own opinion.  And how he escaped the subatomic zone made sense in my opinion, make himself big and he would escape, but you have to admit the subatomic universe made you excited for what they would do with Dr Strange"

marvelstudios,3dpknj,DarthWingo91,20,Sat Jul 18 15:32:14 2015 UTC,"A 3D movie can be $8 in some places. If you really think that people stuck in bad situations or without a lot of money don't still buy cheap entertainment then I can already tell you're an upper-middle class suburban kid through and through who's only experience with poor people is the occasional homeless person on the street. I grew up in a bad part of town. We weren't too too poor, and eventually my parents worked enough to move out and provide a more safe and happier upbringing for my younger brothers and I in suburbia, but I saw some fucked up shit while we were there. Drunk driving was rampant, same as drug use. Burglary and mugging was also common. Most of these poor people turned to detrimental things that cost a lot more than a movie. The fact that OP's only 'fault' is he can't turn down a Marvel movie is nothing compared to the addictions he could be facing. Some of the people in our neighborhood were great people too however, seemingly like OP. They worked so hard to provide for their kids, and were basically living paycheck to paycheck. But part of those expenses is entertainment. What is the point of working so hard if there isn't any fun? I know plenty of extremely poor people who lived in shacks basically, and they still had cable and watched movies. Jesus christ dude, these things are normal and OP is a great father. I'm sure he works harder than you have/will ever work(ed) for your daughter."

I know what its like working 70+ hour weeks and not being able to spend a dime on entertainment for a year and a half.  I was just smart enough not to stick my dick in drug-fueled crazy and bust my nut to get some kid i cant ever see."
marvelstudios,3dpknj,AspsVeryDangerous,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:49:00 2015 UTC,"I grew up lower middle class, and you know what we always found money to do? Go see a movie. Watching a movie in theaters is a special experience that has yet to replicated by even the best TV. The atmosphere, the sounds, the picture. All unique to the theater and something worth so much more than the price of admission. And when I was private barely making enough to pay the bills before my wife found a job, we still made time to go see movies. It's a special, wonderful thing that I hope never goes away, and that I will always make time and money for."

marvelstudios,3dpknj,Kosko,34,Sun Jul 19 00:15:19 2015 UTC,"I think this is one of the many greatest strengths of the MCU, and Marvel in general: the characters. Each one is written and developed to allow someone to relate to at least one character. Feel like you're off on the wrong path and struggling to rebound? You're Scott Lang. Got some personal issues that lead to some wrong choices, but at the end of the day you still care for those around you? Tony Stark's your guy. It's sort of like a personality test. On a slightly unrelated note: saw Ant-Man in IMAX 3D, and by God was it amazing. So many memorable moments, and the gut-busting comedy you'd expect from Marvel was the best of all the MCU. Easily falls into my top three Marvel films.  P.S. Hope you recover, man. Everyone's got those moments where they feel a little lost. Just gotta pull through and hope for the best."

marvelstudios,3dpknj,Bruce_Bruce,3,Sun Jul 19 06:32:23 2015 UTC,This is very interesting. I was just thinking the opposite this morning. I've seen every Marvel film since Winter Soldier at this small theater and usually there's probably 10 or 15 people at the 6-7pm showing. For Ant-Man last night there was at least 40-50 people in that theater.  There really wasn't anything worth a damn playing against it other than Jurassic World though. I also noticed that the majority of people were families not a lot of couples or single people. I hope it does well it really was an amazing film.
marvelstudios,3dpknj,thatgeneralguy,0,Sat Jul 18 14:57:01 2015 UTC,A movie shot in 2D then converted in post isn't the best visually. Now Pixar and DreamWorks animation CG flicks are almost always excellent.

She's basically holding his daughter hostage, and more than a few people were responding to that scene quietly having the same realization. I was astounded by how many people it resonated with in that way, so maybe the movie will benefit fathers in that sense as well as it puts a spotlight on a very common custody issue."

It was about a man trying to do right by his daughter even if she wouldn't know, like they kep saying he wanted to be the person she already thought he was.   It was a radical change from Marvel's usual paths of discovery or origins for heroes. He didn't want to be a hero, he just wanted to be a man his daughter could be proud of. I The theme much like with you struck at many people's hearts while still keeping a good balance of action and humor. Once again marvel blowing all expectations out of the water."

marvelstudios,3dpknj,CrystalElyse,9,Sat Jul 18 12:20:03 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's like $4 extra. Sometimes you need a little something to make you feel good and help you through the dark spots.  At least all he splurged on was 3D and not like an Xboxone or a handle of jack or something."
marvelstudios,3dpknj,chewieconcarne,-4,Sat Jul 18 13:47:01 2015 UTC,It's $3.50 on top of a $9 base ticket price. That's an extra 39% of the cost of a regular showing.
marvelstudios,3dpknj,lazyflowingriver,9,Sat Jul 18 12:59:30 2015 UTC,"Eh, how much does that really matter, though? It's $14 at the most (with tax?). I mean, it's no different from the person in a tight spot that still goes out to lunch once a week with cowokers, or the person who still buys star bucks twice a week for a little boost.   As someone who has been poor.... you really do just sometimes need a tiny splurge to keep you going and feeling like life is worth while and not overbearing and crushing you into defeat.   Spending a whole, gigantic, huge $14 doesn't mean that the guy makes bad choices or is a bad father. It just means he needed a break from reality for a few hours. He needed to feel ""normal."""
marvelstudios,3dpknj,chewieconcarne,-10,Sat Jul 18 13:07:09 2015 UTC,I'm not chastising him for giving himself a break and going to see a movie. I'm saying that the extra $3.50 for 3D is something that I couldn't justify for myself in his position.
marvelstudios,3dpknj,letters_numbers-,10,Sat Jul 18 13:12:21 2015 UTC,"Dude, it's $3.50. What on earth else is he going to do with that? Buy a pack of gum? Save up another 50 cents and get a coffee? Get lunch off the dollar menu? Is there ever going to be a point further on where he is exactly $3.50 or less short and find himself on his knees screaming up to the sky ""Why of why did I have to see that movie in 3D!!!!"" No, of course not. That's would be ridiculous. It's not exactly like that's a game breaking amount of money, here.   You're just getting off on feeling superior to another person."
marvelstudios,3dpknj,letters_numbers-,-5,Sat Jul 18 13:16:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and cigarettes are only $5 a pack. That's how you end up living in your car.

Fuck me for trying to get a small little break from sitting by myself thinking about how shitty my life is, and fuck me even more I guess for deciding to share with you.

Is spending a whole $14 on something that makes you feel good/normal for a few hours, gives you an escape from the soul crushing pain of being poor as fuck something that makes you a bad father? Or a bad person? Hell no. It makes him normal.  You can't just wear yourself thin, pushing yourself and struggling and not take any breaks from it ever.   Assuming his story is true, dude just had a good experience making him feel more energized and dedicated, and wanted to share it with other marvel fans. People who maybe can relate and see how special it was. Maybe he doesn't exactly have a lot of friends in his real life.  It costs nothing to be kind and charitable to strangers, it costs a lot to be hateful towards them over something so small and silly."

marvelstudios,3dw0yt,pq1226,2,Mon Jul 20 00:26:24 2015 UTC,The movie does a really good job at making the ants seem far-fetched but realistic. The bugs are clearly cgi and act in ways that seem a bit super hero-ish but still have a realistic vision. I would say that it wont be that big of a deal and that the movie does an amazing job at making you feel for the ants.
marvelstudios,3dw0yt,FlatTire2005,2,Mon Jul 20 00:37:47 2015 UTC,"I also hate bugs, but the movie is fine. There was one point where I actually went ""Awww"". That has never happened before.

marvelstudios,3dsp56,420_BonerHitler,12,Sun Jul 19 02:12:46 2015 UTC,"The thing is, they've set up every single person to be rightfully distrustful of authority. We've seen this exact scenario play out with Tony and his suit in Iron Man 2.   They've been steadily building a fear in him that will undoubtedly be his driving force. A fear of aliens, fear of the unknown, fear of our vulnerability.   I think the teams will split in ways that are less predictable. If I had to guess based on what is most justifiable to the plot of the comics (and not based exclusively on relationships observed in the MCU) I think this would be the breakdown.  For the AntiReg: Cap, Falcon, and Ant-Man seem to be somewhat established. I don't think Bucky will play a direct role in the conflict, but rather will be the focus of Caps character arc as he slowly gets through to Bucky and helps him remember who he is.  For the ProReg: Ironman, Warmachine, and S.H.I.E.L.D. (if they still exist in this continuity, not quite sure.)  Up in the air.  Black Widow and Hawkeye. It would be most poignant if they split these two up, really drive home the ideological wedge. If they did I'd see Blackwidow going with Cap after the events of Winter Soldier, and Hawkeye remaining with Ironman and S.H.I.E.L.D. you know the people who still protect the secret of his family. I think it makes more sense for the nonpowered avengers to lean towards the ProReg side, as they are mostly embedded in the agencies responsible for cleaning up after the Capes. As well as being closer to the average citizen who are portrayed in the comics as being overwhelmingly ProReg.  Vision and Scarlet Witch. No idea. Vision strikes me as above all this. I think he might side with Tony reluctantly, but overall his goal will be to minimize destruction on both sides. I can't see Scarlet witch being ProReg given her backstory in Age of Ultron, but I don't know how the character will be positioned in the future.  I don't think Hank Pym will be in this, but I think it would be brilliant if he came out as ProReg and fulfilled a similar role to the one he played in the comics. It would accomplish a few great things. Positioning him against Scott Lang, forcing him to work with his despised Tony Stark, and providing a completely different perspective as well as formidable mind for the AntiReg to work against. They already established that he didn't seem to hold the Avengers in high regard, and him working with Tony could allow some great character development as he provides insight into to Tony's father, maybe even being the catalyst to cause Tony to look into Bucky and his parents' deaths.  Everything I've read seems to suggest Spider-man getting a glorified cameo in the film, so I don't think he'll have a large impact on the plot. Similarly we know that while black Panther is in the film, he's unlikely to choose a side given his political position and the fact that audiences have yet to be introduced to him."
marvelstudios,3dsp56,youmonsterikill,3,Sun Jul 19 02:54:49 2015 UTC,"Well thought out. However, while it might be cool, I can't see any way that MCU Pym could come out as pro-registration. This, for reasons revealed in the Ant-Man movie, and because the chances of a Skrull impostor Pym in the MCU is virtually nil."
marvelstudios,3dsp56,LeoAtrox,4,Sun Jul 19 03:21:52 2015 UTC,"True. We don't quite know the root of the conflict yet. If the main request is that heroes be license and trained, I could theoretically see him supporting that on the basis that the bad guys are going to continue to get their hands on tech like his, and he at least wants to require that people using rare tech are trained as Lang was in proper usage."
marvelstudios,3dsp56,youmonsterikill,2,Sun Jul 19 03:30:39 2015 UTC,"Considering the synopsis of Civil War says that politicians create the Superhuman Registration Act I'm guessing it means world leaders will create it including Black Panther especially since they just tore up a part of Africa(has it been confirmed to not be Wakanda, I've remained unsure about that) which would make it seem like he would side with Tony."
marvelstudios,3dsp56,JuanRiveara,2,Sun Jul 19 03:10:43 2015 UTC,Kevin Feige said he's not siding with either of them
marvelstudios,3dsp56,JNPR1996,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:12:07 2015 UTC,"I miswrote my comment, I meant that Black Panther would more to Tony's ideology but not take a side."

marvelstudios,3dsp56,JNPR1996,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:17:52 2015 UTC,It wouldn't exactly mean that besides he will become an Avenger eventually so it makes some sense for him to be leaning towards one of the thoughts but remain neutral. We also don't really know how his story will shape up in Civil War outside of a few statements from Feige.
marvelstudios,3dsp56,JuanRiveara,2,Sun Jul 19 04:24:00 2015 UTC,Maybe Vision plays out like Doctor Strange and just waits for the end

marvelstudios,3dsp56,IronV2,2,Sun Jul 19 20:04:43 2015 UTC,"Here there be Ant-Man spoilers, which only sort of answer your question:  That bit in the post-credits scene about the ""accords"" implies that there will be some sort of governmental treaty affecting heroes in Civil War. It might have less to do with secret identities and more with controlling these very powerful, destructive people. Also, it's not an absolute confirmation, just a quick line in that one out-of-context scene."

marvelstudios,3dsp56,Silverparachute,0,Mon Jul 20 04:54:04 2015 UTC,"Black Widow seems to be the one that no one can decide on. My guess is she starts out with Tony, has an epic fight against Steve (who doesn't want to hit a woman) and then she eventually switches sides."
marvelstudios,3dsp56,fanaka66,0,Sun Jul 19 20:37:12 2015 UTC,"The hitting women comment was as awful as the ""watch yoir language"" joke in AoU."
marvelstudios,3dsp56,oakzap425,5,Mon Jul 20 00:30:57 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say:  Cap:   Falcon (confirmed to be working with Steve) Bucky (Most likley Steve but he could be on Tony's side for a bit until he remembers who he is) Black Widow (Friends with Steve) Ant-man (Falcon will revisit him as seen in post credits) New SHIELD agents Hawkeye (he's never shown favour to either Tony or Steve so I think he'll join this side due to being close to Black Widow Scarlet Witch (might be not sure at first but then realises that Tony has done some horrible things in the past which make her chose steve)   Iron Man   War Machine (friends with Tony) Vision (Considering he was like JARVIS, I think he'd chose his old master over his new team members) Bruce (MAYBE as a small cameo but not likely.) Probably the military and the Iron Legion   Both Spiderman and Black Panther will be in the middle of all this."
marvelstudios,3dsp56,TwitchyCookie,5,Sun Jul 19 02:14:51 2015 UTC,This is how I see it. Although I'd like to see widow join tony so we can see friends become enemies and create a more emotional war story (widow v cap as well as widow v Hawkeye).
marvelstudios,3dsp56,stormz96,5,Sun Jul 19 02:51:04 2015 UTC,"It's really going to irk me if the there is a new shield and they side with Cap. They were one of the biggest driving forces in the conflict and it wouldn't make sense for them to be opposed to the law, and the will of the people.  For all the things that the movie can't adapt from the comics, they really do have a great opportunity to correct one of the comics biggest flaws by portraying the conflict in a more balanced way.  If this is everyone against a villainous, megalomaniacal, thor-cloning Tony Stark I'm going to be really disappointed. Make it interesting, give them both real depth. If Cap has to be 'right' then that's fine so long as you can sympathize with both parties perspectives. This was the ambition of the comic, but most readers will tell you that the characters had been so twisted by the end that it was ideologically lopsided. I hope they do it better."
marvelstudios,3dsp56,youmonsterikill,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:25:07 2015 UTC,"As someone who would come out on Cap's side, I have to say I agree.  These are complex issues and real ones at that.  'The Winter Solider' did an excellent job of having a political/philosophical argument behind it, and this should do the same.  I want Cap to be right, both because I think he is, and because it makes sense given the movie title among other things.  But yes, make Stark and all the others real.  Make them argue their ideas and give them a fair shake.  Per Feige, I think they're going for a level playing field."

I don't think they'd like it--they both have an interest in keeping the Barton family a secret--but they would, theoretically, be outside of the criteria mandating registration anyway.   While Widow is very close to Cap, she's more willing to turn her back on a friend than any person in the MCU besides Fury. If the choice comes down to the Barton family and Steve Rogers, she's going to side with the Bartons."

marvelstudios,3droop,Manibudo,21,Sun Jul 19 01:00:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree, Iron Man 3 definitely was a good lead up to Age of Ultron, it just didn't shove it in your face. The Iron Legion/Ultron/his conversation with Banner about Ultron at Avengers Tower, were all directly due to the events of Iron Man 3.   The Winter Soldier tied in with the Hydra connection, and his dismissal of Tony's idealogy, ""Every time someone tries to end a war before it starts, innocent people die"", which now that I think of it, is actually really clever because it ties in to both Cap movies.   And The Dark World and GotG both tied in through their Infinity gems."

marvelstudios,3droop,narenare658,3,Sun Jul 19 01:00:45 2015 UTC,Iron Man 3 was a great watch for me. I love that the events of the Avengers is affecting Tony so much that he develops severe PTSD from it. It makes him feel more human than just this invincible super hero. And the Mandarin was a scary villain for the amount of time he was the villain who posed as an immediate threat up until that reveal which I didn't see coming the first time I watched.

Phase 1 has The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 dragging it down, and while I love Iron Man, Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor, the quality of Marvel films from The Avengers onwards really ramps up. Iron Man 3 is the best Iron Man film (fight me, scrublords) Thor: The Dark World is the weakest of the bunch but still full of characters I enjoy, and it's visually interesting, with a good sense of humour. In retrospect TDW sticks out as being the least ""about something"" Phase 2 film especially with it sandwiched between IM3 and the exceptional Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Guardians of the Galaxy is fantastic too. Similar to Iron Man 3, Age of Ultron has, I think, an extremely unfair reputation amongst fans, I don't know if it'll ever be a classic Avengers film like the first one, but it's got a much stronger, richer (perhaps less palatable) theme. Ant-Man is great too, but I've only seen it the once. For me personally there isn't a bad film in Phase 2, even at it's worst."
marvelstudios,3droop,Justonepost2015,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:35:00 2015 UTC,"Phase 2 has better stand alone films such as TWS and GOTG, but Phase 1 was such an awesome build up to the Avengers. I will never forget what it felt like seeing that midnight showing of Avengers!! So much fun.  I'll bite on the scrublords challenge! Let me make clear that I LOVE ALL MCU movies, so this isn't me hating IM3 at all. I like IM3, just not as much as I like every other MCU movie with the possible exception of Thor 2.   The main problem I have with Iron Man 3 is that the story is, in my opinion, pretty incoherent when viewed from other character's motivations. Stark's character and behavior works semi-flawlessly (though I'll get to more of that in a second) but the motivations of Killian, Maya Hansen, the Vice President, and even Pepper are all unsupported. For example, at the beginning of the film Killian meets with Pepper to get her and Stark Industries to invest in AIM. Why? It makes no sense when you consider the rest of Killian's plot. After Stark threatens the ""Mandarin"" and gives him his home address Killian presumably orders helicopters to fire missiles in an attempt to kill Stark and Pepper. Why would he do this if he intended to kidnap Pepper all along. These inconsistencies in Killian's plan occur over and over. Pepper, on the other hand, didn't follow up with AIM because extremis sounded ""weaponizable"". This is the silliest and most myopic position a CEO of Stark Industries could take. Most applied science is ""weaponizable"". You would think that would motivate her to get involved to keep it out of the wrong hands. Maya Hansen is a whole other story. What was she intending to do at Stark's house? It makes no sense. She later helps kidnap Pepper, but Killian was angry at her for being at the house. We therefore know he didn't tell her to go there, and yet there she was knowing an attack was about to happen without any discernible motivation for being there. Finally, the idea that the Vice President of the U.S. would betray his country and his president on an experimental treatment for his daughter's limbs is laughable. One last note on character behavior - Tony Stark knew who the Ten Rings were. He was aware of the organization. Seems to me he could have gotten to the bottom of the fake Mandarin in a big hurry but didn't.  Second, the iron man suit which we had just watched battle Thor, the Norse God of Thunder in a fairly evenly matched battle, is now disabled by someone with a really HOT hand! Really? That's all it takes? I think having bad ass extremis soldiers is cool, but disabling the iron man armor with a hot set of fingers after what we have seen it do didn't carry water for me.  Third, while we are on the subject of the suits IM3 betrayed the legacy of IM1 and IM2. Tony's biggest concern in IM2 was others stealing his intellectual property and others taking his suits. This is both ideological and practical. Tony is a capitalist who in the Ayn Rand tradition believes in the sanctity of private property. He also has concerns of what his suit could do in the wrong hands. Suddenly, after Avengers, he is making dozens of them and then giving out his home address, letting Rhodes's suit get stolen (I thought there was a safety override for unapproved users mentioned in IM2 by Romanov), and generally being irresponsible with the things he fought so hard to protect. That seemed like a contradiction in character to me.  Fourth, the final battle made no sense to me at all. The IM suit has fought F-22 Raptors and can fly faster than the speed of sound, has missiles, repulsors, and a laser that can pretty much own anything, and Tony is fist fighting extremis guys. With Thor it made sense - he wasn't trying to kill Thor. With the extremis soldiers it seemed like a pretty stupid thing for a genius to do.  Fifth, this was the only Phase 2 standalone where the absence of the other Avengers made no sense at all. In Thor 2 most of the action is off planet until the very end where the battle occurs in London very suddenly and without much notice. In Winter Soldier Captain America doesn't know who to trust and can't call for help because he doesn't know who is hydra and who isn't. Guardians is off planet. Yet, even when the President of the United States is captured, Air Force One is blown up, an Iron Man suit is stolen, and Tony Stark is presumed dead and murdered, Cap, Widow and Hawkeye are nowhere to be seen. I can't buy it.  Sixth, and  I know people are gonna react to this complaint because I have seen it discussed on here before, Tony Stark ends IM3 in a very ambiguous manner. Marvel and RDJ were still in negotiations and it wasn't clear if he would return for phase 3. The movie ends with him blowing up the Iron Legion and saying ""I am Iron Man"" with a different tone than in IM1 as if to imply either he was going to continue being Iron Man in the suit, or equally possible that he himself was Iron Man without he suit and wasn't going to suit up anymore. All of that is fine and good, but then it wasn't touched on at all in Age of Ultron. I suppose we can assume now that he meant he would always be Iron Man and wear the suit, but it makes the ending seem sort of less dramatic in hindsight.  And then I have a number of nitpicks including:  Why was the female extremis assassin scarred if the virus heals your wounds?  Why was his suit charged with a battery when we just saw two movies showing us the arc reactor?  Why was that guy constantly chewing bubble gum? Stupid complaint, I know, but it really bothers me when I watch it now."
marvelstudios,3droop,Rek07,27,Mon Jul 20 22:54:26 2015 UTC,"Well if we match them up:    Iron Man 2 & 3 were both disappointments in large but everyone has an opinion on which was worse so I'll split hairs and call it a tie.      Avengers 1 & 2, also a tie. 1 was full of magic as the first team up film but I think 2 will hold up better with time. Tie.    Thor & Thor 2 both pretty average films that should have been better. Tie. I'm willing to put Ant-Man up with the original Iron-Man as far as great movies go. Tie.    Then it's Hulk & Captain America 1 vs Guardians & The Winter Solider... Phase 2 wins.

marvelstudios,3droop,Zodiachunter,2,Sun Jul 19 19:35:13 2015 UTC,"I think Phase 2 is better for the sheer variety of it. If you can have Winter Soldier and GOTG in the same phase, you know you have some film diversity.  Phase 1 was Avengers setup, and that's fine, but the movies didn't feel different, from a tonal and thematic standpoint. Obviously the movies were all different, but it was all an origin story for a future Avenger. Phase 2 mostly did away with that, and now we've gotten two (three if you count AoU) funny as hell movies and a dark political thriller. I just feel like that's the point the MCU should always be at, so I like Phase 2 better."
marvelstudios,3droop,darthmcchub,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:40:39 2015 UTC,"I think in Phase One it was more stepping stones and world building to create this massive universe and while that may give it the edge tonally, I believe Phase Two is stronger because that's when we started getting Marvel films inside different genres. Although IM3 and Thor 2 were terrible, Winter Solider was a political thriller, Guardians a space opera, and Ant-Man a heist film and that proved that these kind of films work better that way."

Especially if we consider that Iron Man 3 is a success for most people, despite being Marvel's biggest failure  in my book. That coupled with the universally acclaimed Winter Soldier and GotG leave phase 1 eating dust. We had a great run so far, onwards!   Edit: Looking back at it, the MCU is being pretty great for me:    I love 6 movies out of 12 (Iron Man, Avengers, Avengers 2, Cap 2, GotG, Ant-Man); Really like 3 of them (Cap, Thor, Iron Man 2); Slightly dislike 2 of them (TIH and Thor 2); And only really hate one out of them all (IM 3)."
marvelstudios,3droop,TheDoctorMate,3,Sun Jul 19 02:43:38 2015 UTC,"What you've said about IM3 actually weirdly makes me happy because I see everyone on this sub loving it. But really I think it's up (or down) there with X-Men Origins: Wolverine with how fucking dreadful it was. It probably wasn't quite as bad as Origins but fuck me I hate that film. Main things that really bug me are:  1) the fucking kid. Why is he in there. For children to relate to? It's a film about fucking terrorists, why do we need kids in it in such a big role and why the fuck does iron man need him. So so bad.   2) the humour is really dreadful imo, even though I love what RDJ does. I just think the jokes are very badly timed, out of place, and badly written.   3) massive build up to the end scene, calls the suits in. I'm thinking ok could be cool. Barely see fucking anything of the suits and then he blew them up.   4) pepper is so annoying and there's some really really bad acting from some of the supporting roles. The woman with black hair, can't remember her name and don't really want to but she was laughably bad at some points.   5) the shitty horrible speech at the end.   6) why did they do what they did to mandarin/aldrich. A proper slap in the face to fans of the character. Wouldn't mind a different take on a villain or anything but come on the mandarin is such a cool one, they shoulda done him right.   Bonus) WHY WAS THE MANDARIN SO RACIST. His name is the Mandarin. Chinese. fucking Mandarin Chinese but because he's a terrorist he's from the Middle East??? I normally don't even go on about this kind of thing in films but that was so so bad.   Sorry about that I just really hate that film and it gets a lot of praise."

This means if they want to refrain from announcing what comes after IW2 then they have to not make any not-previously-announced movies until IW2 is out. And that could put as much as a two year gap between IW2 and whatever comes next.  Then again, maybe they want to do that. I don't know."

We can dismiss the idea that any of these movies are set in stone and it makes sense that Marvel can move films around if they want to. In this case, there is still room in 2018 for an Ant-Man 2 film. From the end of July to November 2018, there are no major films set to be released yet. Marvel can easily claim a date.

Marvel certainly won't postpone a 2018 release of the first black and female superheroes for Ant-Man.  Four movies a year sounds insane.  One step at a time, please.

marvelstudios,3dswng,CountScarlioni,3,Sun Jul 19 04:09:42 2015 UTC,"It's just that they literally refer to the days things occur (""last night"") and such, so even if all events take place, the actual facts are being rewritten."

marvelstudios,3dswng,basiamille,11,Sun Jul 19 04:46:01 2015 UTC,"My head canon: the one-shot is how Peggy remembers her time between The First Avenger and the formation of SHIELD. Sadly, the Alzheimer's means she misremembers some things, compresses timelines, and casts that nice young man from The West Wing as her boss, when that's not even close to how it happened."
marvelstudios,3dswng,GalaxyGuardian,8,Sun Jul 19 07:15:39 2015 UTC,"My headcanon was that the one-shot is just a story that Peggy tells her grandkids. It's not entirely accurate to real life, but it's a quick and exciting summary of her life after WWII. She was mistreated by her coworkers for being a women, acted as a badass in the field, and helped form Shield with Howard Stark."
marvelstudios,3dswng,overload37,5,Sun Jul 19 15:13:12 2015 UTC,Oooh I like this
marvelstudios,3dswng,bflaminio,8,Sun Jul 19 11:54:40 2015 UTC,"More or less, I'd say the series has superseded the one shot. Until the announcement that season 2 will be in LA, the one shot still could have fit after the series season 1. We'll just have to wait and see if season 2 completely invalidates the one shot, or if we can still fanwank it into canon."
marvelstudios,3dswng,Obiwanjezz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:50:05 2015 UTC,"I think it is cannon but its set after the series is as current. At the end of it, Howard Stark calls up Bradley Whitford (Don't remember the chiefs name in the one shot) and tells him that Peggy is going to go and run Shield.  In Agent carter as of yet, Shield doesn't exist. The SSR does.  So the way I see it is the Agent Carter one shot is going to be sort of the finale of the TV show. But who knows. It might just be an alternate version of something that will appear in the show."
marvelstudios,3dswng,doctorben,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:06:08 2015 UTC,"I think I read somewhere that when they were first announcing the Agent Carter series, they acknowledged the one-shot and that the series would, essentially, take place ""in the middle"" of the one-shot. So the one-shot would technically be cut into two pieces, bookending the Agent Carter series. I guess they went for it with this method as a contingency in case the one-shot wasn't well-received, in that it could act as an end to Peggy's story.  Which, almost, actually, sounds worse and makes a massive headache when trying to fit everything together."
marvelstudios,3dswng,OllieRaiden,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:45:22 2015 UTC,"I think I read somewhere a loooooong while back, like before Agent Carter was released, that the One Shot was to act as the definitive end of the series. So everything we've seen thus far takes place before the One Shot. Which, I appreciate, is muddied by the fact they used footage from it in the first episode, but I assume that's down to lack of any other footage to show/ no time to shoot it. And, that one scene aside, that's pretty much how I've been running with it so far.   Unless season 2 takes us somewhere wildly different and takes place after the One Shot. Which I wouldn't mind. The formation of Shield sounds like a great season to me!"
marvelstudios,3dswng,TrentGgrims,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:32:26 2015 UTC,"The One Shot was in Brooklyn 1946, and S2 is in Los Angeles, and I think it's 1947 now, but not sure on the date."

marvelstudios,3dswng,youmonsterikill,-1,Mon Jul 20 13:20:33 2015 UTC,"Kevin Feige has said that continuity trickles down from the films to the television shows. This is actually a really similar set up to George Lucas and the expanded universe in Star Wars. Basically what the films portray is 100% Canon that will affect the shows, but what the shows do doesn't necessarily affect, or hold any sway over the world of the films. It's why Coulson exists in Limbo. In the movies he's still dead. In the shows he's very much alive and active. Bits of the show can be arranged to tie in with the movies, but not in anyway that would ever require general audiences to be aware of their existence."
marvelstudios,3dswng,CountScarlioni,13,Sun Jul 19 03:40:25 2015 UTC,"In the movies he's still dead.   No, no, no. That isn't what Whedon meant at all. He simply meant that as far as the Avengers know, Coulson is still dead, and so the movie wouldn't acknowledge him, since a large portion of the audience themselves still think he is dead. But what ""old friend"" did you think Fury was referring to? Small, indirect references like that are what they have to work with."
marvelstudios,3dswng,youmonsterikill,-6,Sun Jul 19 06:03:56 2015 UTC,"I'm tired of arguing this every time it comes up.  You can say that Whedon doesn't have final say in MCU Canon which is valid but here is a direct quote from him.   “It’s a weird little yes and no. As far as I’m concerned in the films, yes he’s dead. In terms of the narrative of these guys [The Avengers] his loss was very important. When I created the television show, it was sort of on the understanding that this can work and we can do it with integrity, but these Avengers movies are for people to see the Avengers movies and nothing else. And it would neither make sense nor be useful to say ‘Oh and by the way remember me? I died!’”"
marvelstudios,3dswng,CountScarlioni,7,Sun Jul 19 06:36:59 2015 UTC,"You forgot to add the first part of that quote where he joked about how everybody took what he was saying to mean that AoS was no longer canonical, or not real - ""Yeah he's dead. The entire television series is just a fever dream. It's a Jacob's Ladder moment he's having at the point of death, but we don't give that away until after season seven. And there's a snow globe. Now I've given it away. Bollocks!""  What he is saying there is, Coulson is as good as dead. Obviously even he thinks the idea of saying ""Oh yeah, that stuff isn't canon lol"" is ridiculous. Even more obviously considering that he refers to Coulson in the movie, just not by name. As a treat to the people who do watch AoS. But as he says in the quote you posted, the movies have a primary focus - they have to make sense to the non-diehards. The casual moviegoers, who maybe have only ever seen The Avengers, and saw Coulson die in that one. So in the second one, they can't just have him be back, because it would ""neither make sense nor be useful."" You aren't going to write in a synopsis of Coulson's AoS Season 1 story arc and expect the people who are there just to see Iron Man and Thor fight a robot together to have any idea of what you're talking about. But, if the movie had been dedicated to the idea of exploring the Avengers' response to Coulson's survival, then it would have then been useful. And Whedon even said that was at least an existing possibility, but not one that he was going to pick up on because AOU was doing too much for it to be worthwhile or be given enough time:   ""He could. Right now it's not something I'm pursuing because I have so much going on in Avengers 2. Finding out that Coulson is alive would be an entire B story. And I already have too much movie. That's better than the other thing."""
marvelstudios,3dswng,youmonsterikill,-5,Sun Jul 19 07:14:09 2015 UTC,"Nothing in your post contradicts the fact that he said outright.    ""As far as I’m concerned in the films, yes he’s dead.""   The movie is canon, the show is canon they're just not the same canon and they're weighed differently in eyes of the Marvel execs. The fact that Coulson could come back in the films does not change the reality of their current state."
marvelstudios,3dswng,tcedwards92,6,Sun Jul 19 15:49:45 2015 UTC,"They are both canon, in the movies he is believed to be dead, in the tv show he is not. So overall in the universe, he IS NOT dead, just that the main characters of the movies believe hes dead.  Any other way would destroy the MCU. Because then you would have a Movie MCU and a TV MCU. If Marvel wants these connected they need to keep them like that. Not have a watered down ""yea its sort of in the same universe, but not really"" because makes it be two different universes. I really hate how Marvel has left all this up to discussion, really sucks. Dont mix tv and movies unless your gonna give it 100%."
marvelstudios,3dswng,youmonsterikill,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:05:06 2015 UTC,Does continuity of the one-shots exist somewhere between film and TV? Are Netflix series higher or lower than the ABC series?
marvelstudios,3dswng,jim25y,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:17:45 2015 UTC,"No clue. But it's based on the idea that this gives the shows more freedom to explore without needing to obsessively be continuity checked against all existing properties. Which is necessary given the different productions scheduled.  If I had to guess I think it would go Films>Most One Shots>Television and Netflix  I don't know if there is a difference in continuity between the network shows and the Netflix shows. Network shoes have higher viewership, but the Netflix shows are all produced at one time in close cooperation with the Canon keepers, so take that for what you will."
marvelstudios,3dswng,CountScarlioni,3,Sun Jul 19 04:46:17 2015 UTC,"I think it actually goes films>tv>one shots.  The Agent Carter one-shot was made as a test run to see if she could hold up on her own show. As such, I think it's semi-canon. But I definitely think the show supercedes the one shot."
marvelstudios,3dswng,Riley1066,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:56:21 2015 UTC,But I definitely think the show supercedes the one shot.   Absolutely. It just makes sense. The number of people that watch the TV and Netflix shows far outweighs the number of people who have seen the Blu-Ray exclusive extras.
marvelstudios,3dswng,BoobsMadeMeDoIt,2,Sun Jul 19 12:05:29 2015 UTC,I think the whole One Shot concept should be maxi-sized and turned into Netflix Marvel Movies ... stuff that's not quite enough for a feature film but long enough to warrant a full story ... like a Man-Thing Marvel Netflix movie.

marvelstudios,3dn6p3,endercoaster,17,Fri Jul 17 17:23:40 2015 UTC,"I remember sitting in Age of Ultron. Only a couple got up and left when the scene came on after some credits.  The rest of us sat there for 10 more minutes until it was completely done and the lights turned on. Even then, people still didn't want to get up and leave because there HAD to be more than just the 50th cameo of Thanos.  It was devastating."

They had to sit through a lot more boring credits and then they became too impatient to wait a minute or two more for the awesome credits scene."

I think Ant-Man and Guardians was a little different because they were kinda just thrown into the mix, but its apparent that Black Panther is going to have a huge part of Civil War and Avengers so I'm sure Marvel really wants there to be a certain part of his story to be told. I think Marvel is going to want a lot more control over movies like Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and Dr. Strange as opposed to say the Inhumans since they're being made so close to the Avengers and that movie is ultimately supposed to be the end to the current storyline they've been telling in the MCU."

marvelstudios,3dpy8f,goodbrock,40,Sat Jul 18 08:37:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree, i LOVE the first act. I love seeing the group slowly get together.  It also makes Iron Man's entrance so much cooler."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,Manibudo,4,Sat Jul 18 10:09:40 2015 UTC,"It's not the introduction that bothers me. They set up the characters very well--and succinctly, without too much backstory/explanation. It's the whole middle part that sags the film down.   Of course, upon first viewing there's the allure of the ""will they/won't they?"" dilemma of the team actually pulling off. But on rewatch the exposition is just dull and uneventful.   Lemme just do a quick reductio ad absurdum play by play to sum up my sentiments:   Avengers are intro'd one by one Goose chase to find Loki/Barton and a whole lot of infighting Loki 'surrenders' and the helicarrier sinks for half an hour Kick ass battle in NYC.   I honestly think they could have done the initial tensions among the team a lot better."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,rjung,13,Sat Jul 18 10:22:12 2015 UTC,"If you go into any narrative with the ending as a foregone conclusion -- especially if it's something you've finished already -- it's going to seem tedious.  It's the uncertainty of the final act that carries the bulk of most stories, at least if you're not Michael Bay."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,RedBarrel,12,Sat Jul 18 17:04:53 2015 UTC,"I just really like the dialogue in the first Avengers movie. It wasn't a quip contest for the most part (and even when it is, it makes sense since they don't all like each other) and seeing the personalities bounce off of each other was great. I liked the scenes of them just talking to each other just as much as I liked the action and the novelty. Not because what they were saying was particularly interesting, but because of the all the little character moments, like Tony trying to convince Bruce to fight with them. So, yeah, it's slow, but I'm just as engaged in the slow scenes as I am the superhero fights and final battle. Once the heroes start being introduced, that is."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,the1egend1ives,23,Sat Jul 18 14:20:36 2015 UTC,"THIS is why I believe Age of Ultron is so much better. Avengers was on TV not too long ago and I couldn't bring myself to watch it. So much of it boils down to them hanging around the helicarrier. When the action does happen, it's mostly gunfighting up until the third act."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,dannzo_29,3,Sat Jul 18 14:05:58 2015 UTC,"I loved the hanging around the Helicarrier bits, honestly IMO Age of Ultron needed more of that stuff."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,Rek07,6,Sat Jul 18 23:56:15 2015 UTC,It was on TV a few months ago and despite having it on bluray in my draw and could want it anytime I just couldn't turn it off ad-breaks and all. It's certainly not as good as many of the Phase 2 films but I still enjoy seeing it.   I will still forever rank it highly as watching it for the first time was my favourite experience watching a film in my adult life.
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,Nickerdoodle,6,Sat Jul 18 11:46:46 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it boils down to the fact that The Avengers was great when it was the biggest thing the MCU had done. At this point, we've seen it only get bigger and better."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,thatdeductivefellow,6,Sat Jul 18 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"I absolutely cannot agree with you. Every single time I rewatch the Avengers, it is an absolutely joyful experience from beginning to end. I feel the complete opposite as you in fact, and could rewatch the Avengers endlessly and never get bored or displeased."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,Brogener,5,Sat Jul 18 18:46:43 2015 UTC,"I mean I get what you're saying, but I've noticed this with almost any movie. If I've seen a movie several times, no matter how much I like it, certain parts of it can feel like a chore because I know exactly what happens when. Even though I still really enjoy them, I find myself just sort of waiting to get to my favorite parts. That being said, I've not yet reached that point with The Avengers even after like 15 viewings. All the dialogue is so well written and I think the buildup is necessary. The battle of NY is undoubtedly the high point, but I still enjoy everything leading up to that. Of course it's all personal opinion.  Age of Ultron's overstuffed-ness might actually cause it to age better in that regard. It's got a lot more really good action scenes spread throughout. Hell, it starts with action. Not an instant classic like the first, but if the battle of NY is the only part that still really captivates you, you may enjoy it more down the line."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,JobaccaWookiee,6,Sat Jul 18 16:09:18 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this after Ant-Man as well,and personally I STILL cant get over the novelty. Just the sheer fact alone that The Avengers exists and has lead to the MCU as we now know it still blows my damn mind. I do agree with your points though...the beginning and the end of the movie are great,but GODDAMN does it drag when they get to the Helicarrier. Still though....to a kid who grew up with the Lou Ferigno Hulk and those shitty made for tv crossovers they did,I still cant stop being astounded by The Avengers."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,rhodetolove,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:46:33 2015 UTC,It drags so much. I was not expecting to feel bored during one of my favorite movies.

When re-watching from the beginning I was kinda disappointed. Whenever I rewatch it now, my attention is usually elsewhere until the final act."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,ldashandroid,0,Sat Jul 18 08:44:17 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda the same way. I still cherish the movie for its novelty, but when I'm in the mood for it I usually turn it on as background noise for when I'm doing menial tasks like house work or bills."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,mixolydian807,2,Sat Jul 18 08:48:50 2015 UTC,"I've watched Avengers 1 at least 6 times and Avengers 2 about 5 times. This goes for all the MCU Movies except Hulk, Cap 1 and Thor 2(I don't own those). After watching Ant Man I've realized that trying to rank them is pretty unfair. They are just getting better. When I first watched Iron Man 3 i thought it wasn't that good because of plot with the kid. But after a second watch I pay attention to the detail and the scenes and I realized it's much better than the other Iron Man movies in everything except plot.  U may feel the story of one movie more than it's newer counter part but the costumes, the cgi, the set design, the way the characters relate to one another is just getting better.  I think Cap 2 is the best at this point because it's story is pretty good and it's action sequences are fucking awesome but I have no doubt that Cap 3 will be better."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,resident16,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:24:41 2015 UTC,I feel the same way about the iron man movies.
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,SuperCoenBros,2,Mon Jul 20 07:15:49 2015 UTC,Kind of in the same boat. Watched it recently and just wasn't as into it like I was originally. I guess that's because I know what to expect and whatnot. But it's still one of my personal favorites simply because it changed the game in terms of film.
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,prophetofgreed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:30:00 2015 UTC,"100% agreed. In my big old ranking of MCU films, Avengers is in the bottom four. I generally love the solo films, but the actual Avengers teamup left me very cold.  I'm glad Avengers exists, because it helped pave the way for Phase Two. I think that Phase Two is better than Phase One by just about every conceivable metric."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,errantknight1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:12:42 2015 UTC,The first act of the film is all set up and can be very dull on a rewatch. For me the third act is one of Marvel's best.   Still love the movie but understand where that criticism comes from about Avengers.
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,resultsmayvary0,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:55:34 2015 UTC,"Personally, I rate the marvel movies far differently than most. I liked th Avengers--mostly based on the brilliant choreograph of the final battle--but I didn't LOVE it, and I didn't like age of Ultron at all. IMO, CA:TWS is the best of the Marvel movies, followed by the first Ironman, with Avengers after that and AoU as one of the less sucessful, but the fact is, we all have different qualities we look for in a film. I liked the first half, myself, and it was taking the time with the characters that sets it above AoU, for me--among other things."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,errantknight1,2,Sat Jul 18 18:07:25 2015 UTC,"""Personally, I rate the marvel movies far differently than most""  Nearly every ranking I see has CA:TWS in the first place position, mainly because it's easily the best.

marvelstudios,3dpy8f,CuckyAsInCookie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:40:39 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed GoG. Chris Pratt is both skilled and an incredibly likable actor. I just prefer movies with comedy more on the side and dry than front and center. Personal taste, not a definition of quality. There, I was mostly referring to the fact that I put CA:TFA much higher than most do, even though it was hindered by the fact that it's hard to leave the audience feeling satisfied when the film ends with the hero losing both his best friend and the love of his life."
marvelstudios,3dpy8f,Celoth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:52:53 2015 UTC,"To me is the opposite: everytime I watch it, I like it more. I still think it's the best MCU movie. It can be said that CA:TWS is technically better, but I enjoy more The Avengers."

marvelstudios,3dpy8f,TripleSkeet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:04:51 2015 UTC,"What I think and, what was also really probably Whedon's intention, was that everything about the plot was about Loki pissing off every single one of the Avengers (+ Fury).  Every one has his ""moment"" with him.  In order we have Fury's confrontation at the beginning, Cap's fight, Thor trying to reason him, Natasha's interrogation, Coulson's death, Stark's confrontation at Stark tower, Hulk Smashing Loki and Hawkeye's exploding arrow ( I'd also argue that the final group shot with him in front aiming at Loki would count).  The movie was also a lot of fan service. Pretty much any pair of the Avengers you can think of (except probably Iron Man + Black Widow) has their fight/moment."

marvelstudios,3dpy8f,TheJonatron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:23:07 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. There are major problems with this movie. And I find more every time I watch it.  Age of Ultron isn't a whole lot better (how about the fact that they had Loki's staff for like three days in the first movie for study, but in AoU they act like they've only just gotten a chance to look at it?).  And watching it after the others, it feels so much less cinematic to me, especially in the opening sequence. So much of it looks like TV to me."

marvelstudios,3dr0ig,BiggChicken,9,Sat Jul 18 17:50:21 2015 UTC,it feels like the post-credit scene of phase 2 if phase 2 is one whole big movie
marvelstudios,3dr0ig,tagabalon,4,Sat Jul 18 18:46:00 2015 UTC,I'd say so. Everything thus far has been setting up for civil war.
marvelstudios,3dr0ig,goodbrock,4,Sat Jul 18 17:11:08 2015 UTC,I don't think it does and I like it... Everything seems connected at this point were full steam ahead for 'Civil War'. Im not sure we will see end of phases as clear as we did with 'Phase 1'.   'Phase 3' will end with InHumans not Avengers. Extremely surprised and happy how Ant-Man just added to this universe and didn't seem like an afterthought after the issues with making it.

Most of his intentions and actions work to prevent harming the innocent and to protect them. Of course we know things don't always go as planned, but that is mainly what services the plot.  I know that we're going to get a Tony vs Steve but to be honest neither of them are ""evil,"" they simply have a difference in beliefs. Now the MCU version will just be a watered down version of the original story and will focus more on hero Accountability for collateral damage rather than secret identity (since no one in the MCU really has one save for a few). But to answer your question, no Stark is not evil. He will be portrayed in an antagonistic light in the upcoming films, however opposition does not always imply a fine delineation between good and bad."
marvelstudios,3dsu0p,HoennBorn,4,Sun Jul 19 03:12:00 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking about this. They really have an opportunity to do this part of Civil War better than the comics and to portray a more balanced ideology. That was always the ambition, I just feel by the end of the comics it was so lopsided. You really couldn't side with Tony after all he had done. With tighter writing, and great actors they could really do something special."
marvelstudios,3dsu0p,youmonsterikill,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:35:21 2015 UTC,"This is part of the reason I'm so excited for Civil War: the comic series had a lot of merit to begin with, and the premise really did deal with a difficult, no-right-answers conflict, but it all got thrown away by the end to make Cap the clear hero in the right (even though personally I felt Tony's initial position was much more sympathetic). Hopefully, with better writers and directors focused on making a more balanced portrayal of both characters, we'll be able to get the comic story we should have had, or at least a version of it. There's a huge potential for a brilliant story in Civil War, and I so want to see that potential reached."

Having said that, it took him over ten years to get the movie off the ground and was supposedly unwilling to introduce the bigger MCU elements that now existed. I understand why he left, but it took longer than a decade for the project to complete and it may not have finished at all if he hadn't left.

marvelstudios,3dpwvz,ProphetGentleman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:52:58 2015 UTC,"Huh, now that I think about it, we do have a radio station called ""ZM"" in New Zealand. Which is a call sign owned by us."

marvelstudios,3dpwvz,darpavader1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:00:00 2015 UTC,"I'll just paste it from my other comment in this thread.   Although, you had me thinking just why do we have random letter acronyms. So after some quick googling I came across this article  Apparently they originated as broadcast identifiers per location."
marvelstudios,3dpwvz,darpavader1,2,Sat Jul 18 14:07:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not sold that it's just random call letters (although four letters starting with 'W' is the standard broadcast code for the US).  But it's a national news service, so like CNN, MSNBC, etc., it would logically stand for something. Plus the lowercase ""i"" is out of place for the local code style."
marvelstudios,3dpwvz,GV_Solid_Snake,2,Sat Jul 18 14:50:58 2015 UTC,"In the united states the Federal Communications Commission, and internationally the International Telecommunications Union, assign these call signs, particularly in North and South America.  Most radio or local tv stations are given 4 letter call signs, with the first letter being based on region (rule of thumb being, east of the Mississippi River gets a W, and west of it gets a K).  4 letters is the minimum, but they can be longer, especially for Amateur radio licences, which follow a similar code. For professional stations, generally, aside from the W or K you are assigned, the following letters are assigned sequentially (ie, first station gets WAAA, next is WAAB), though you can pay to choose your own combination if the one you want hasn't been assigned or if you want to buy it from someone else (they do this when they want the letters to be meaningful, but most of the time they don't).   Source: Licensed Amateur Radio operator in the United States. My call sign is KD8KUR (in Amateur licenses, they are additionally assigned a number corresponding to region, 8 indicates the Great Lakes area). Also, the beginning identifier (in my case KD) is done differently for amateurs than stations, which is why I have a K east of the Mississippi."
marvelstudios,3dpwvz,GV_Solid_Snake,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:33:30 2015 UTC,"Local TV stations are giving call signs, like radio.  I know that the local network stations are W in NY, so CBS is WCBS, NBC is WNBC, etc.  And they're given K in LA, so KCBS, KNBC, etc."
marvelstudios,3drmde,lebronGOAT23,7,Sat Jul 18 20:03:06 2015 UTC,"The best: Winter Soldier, Avengers, Age of Ultron, Guardians of the Galaxy.  Special mentions: Captain America, Iron Man, Ant-Man."

marvelstudios,3drmde,stormz96,3,Sat Jul 18 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"Just saw it a 2nd time (this time in 3D) and I'd have to agree. This one ties Guardians of the Galaxy for me. The 3D is definitely recommended. I'm not usually a fan of those movies but this was worth it. Convinced my parents to go see it (they've seen them all so far but are usually hesitant about waiting until DVD) and they both said it's their new favorite. Really glad they ended the phase with a success, especially w/ the rough start of IM3 & Thor2"
marvelstudios,3drmde,OHMmer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:11:32 2015 UTC,"Ant Man was definitely one of the more satisfying MCU films I've seen especially with how well it knitted itself into the large universe and with the post credits scenes.

marvelstudios,3dpsaj,Twaletta,19,Sat Jul 18 07:03:20 2015 UTC,"My favorite show by like ten miles is Daredevil, but I also liked Agent Carter a lot. I just really loved Daredevil that much.  Captain America The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Ant-Man are tied for my favorite movies, I think. Sometimes I give Cap 2 the edge, but I rewatched Guardians recently and just saw Ant-Man. I love all the movies so much, it's not too easy to pick a favorite these days.  Favorite superhero is probably Scarlet Witch? I don't know, I also really love Cap and Black Widow and Vision."
marvelstudios,3dpsaj,gemitry,3,Sat Jul 18 07:18:41 2015 UTC,"Somehow I completely missed Daredevil.  I killed my Netflix account a while back so it wasn't in my face reminding me.  I'm almost through episode 3 and, so far, it's really, really good.  If it keeps up like this, it's going to trump AoS.  Netflix seriously changed the game when they started producing original content."
marvelstudios,3dpsaj,CountScarlioni,9,Sat Jul 18 21:52:23 2015 UTC,"Movie-wise, my favorite is far and away Cap 2. Pure brilliance in writing and action, and very resonant with today's political situations.  As far as the shows go, AoS and AC, while certainly good, just don't compare to Daredevil. Actually, with only three to choose from in this category, I am hesitant to answer - I will probably feel more comfortable with it once a few more shows come out. If for no other reason then for Daredevil to have some solid competition.  Favorite hero? Hm. I mean, I love Iron Man. But Quicksilver also left a pretty good impression on me. The Vision was terrific too. And Star-Lord, although he is just a regular human.   I mean, come on, 'effing Nazis? Really?   Well I mean, Hydra did branch off from the Nazi party. While Schmidt himself didn't see much in them, it isn't hard to believe that at least a few of them would have believed in Nazi ideals even after Hydra broke away."
marvelstudios,3dpsaj,errantknight1,5,Sat Jul 18 07:34:59 2015 UTC,"The thing that made smile about The Winter Soldier is that here we've got this character that was originally conceived long ago as an ultra-patriotic-god-bless-america type of hero, holding the exact opposite viewpoint to that type of person in the modern day.  I don't think it was unintentional."
marvelstudios,3dpsaj,baribigbird06,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:52:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know.  They really didn't even focus on the Nazi aspect, anyway.  I rolled my eyes because there are other franchises <cough, Star Trek> that played that card very badly in the past.  I usually have the same reaction when a show plays the ""time travel"" card, again, because of Star Trek.  I can do time travel if it's the primary plot of a show like Continuum.  But let's not bring it in as a side story or anything."
marvelstudios,3dpsaj,pacotacobell,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:59:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it's actually possible to compare network television to Daredevil. I mean, the shows are SO different and created with such a different sensibility, I don't know that one can be said to be 'better' than the other. IMO, they're all very successful in fulfilling their own goals. I really like all 3 and picking one over another would be a little like picking which of your kids you like best, lol.  I also find it hard to compare movies like GoG and CA:TWS. Entirely different genres. There, I can say that I enjoyed CA:TWS the most of the movies, but then my favorite of all the marvel movies are the Captain America ones. They have a kind of heart and emotional impact that the others lack, imo, which is something I look for in a story.  I think there are few of us who don't like Coulson and find him integral to the MCU. I was very glad to see him back. Oh, just thought of something...Civil War is just going to kill Coulson. He's all about registering potential dangers, but he's also Steve's biggest fan...."
marvelstudios,3dpsaj,threesquares,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:16:54 2015 UTC,"Well, Coulson was created specifically to provide a relatable character to tie the MCU together.  It worked.    I did read somewhere, though, that they have no intention of bringing Coulson back into the films.  It seems to me like that has got to be really difficult to do, considering he's now the Director of SHIELD and all."
marvelstudios,3dpsaj,Frozen_Canadian,7,Sat Jul 18 22:02:20 2015 UTC,"Congrats, now go watch Ant-Man! A lot more connective tissue to be had along with just good, pure Marvel fun.  Oh, and Phil Coulson is absolutely a superhero, in fact he's an AVENGER."
marvelstudios,3dpsaj,EndoveProduct,2,Sat Jul 18 07:49:45 2015 UTC,"For TV shows, it's definitely Daredevil, but AoS is a very close second. I enjoyed the hell out of Agent Carter, but it didn't have as much going on as AoS or Daredevil. Though by next year my favorite show will probably be Luke Cage, if only for character bias.    For movies, Winter Soldier, GoTG, and Iron Man are all tied for my favorites. All three are legitimately good films which I've rewatched at least 4 times. Followed closely by Age of Ultron (even with the character flaws), then Avengers, and lastly Ant-Man.    Favorite hero is probably Scott Lang or Cap."

marvelstudios,3dpsaj,Supertrinko,0,Sat Jul 18 21:46:46 2015 UTC,Iron Man 2 barely had any action. Mostly filler. Are you sure you watched the right movie?

marvelstudios,3ds2xw,Gruntykins,8,Sat Jul 18 22:32:43 2015 UTC,Marvel has acknowledged The Incredible Hulk like a billion times in its other movies and shows.
marvelstudios,3ds2xw,ClintBartonHawkguy,2,Sat Jul 18 22:37:14 2015 UTC,"They acknowledge banner/Hulk and not much else. Other important characters have fallen by the wayside. The Leader and The Abomination were written away in a comic, Betty seems to have been completely forgotten, and Ross up until recently I can't recall hearing about.  That's not the point of my post though. Just a thought I had. Just wanted to have some fun speculative though on whether or not would TIH be better or worse if it had Ruffalo from the get go instead of Norton."
marvelstudios,3ds2xw,UmbrusNightshade,5,Sat Jul 18 22:46:28 2015 UTC,"I'd say it'd be ""better"" only because it would be a consistent actor. Not saying either Ruffalo or Norton is bad, but with a constant actor it would mesh better (for me at least). Though I am kinda able to ""superimpose"" Ruffalo's Banner on top of Norton's, in my mind, while watching TIH which helps."

marvelstudios,3ds2xw,jwoodell3,3,Sun Jul 19 03:58:05 2015 UTC,"Worse. Edward Norton is the highlight of that movie. And I know I'm in the minority, but I don't like Ruffalo's Banner. He just seems like a poser to me. I do prefer the Hulk in Avengers over TIH though.   What I'd kinda love is a Hulk movie set between TIH and Avengers that would somehow create a reason for the transition. Like excessive gamma rays or something turns Ed Norton into Mark Ruffalo. Or he gets surgically altered for hiding. Or whatever. But I think that would be hilarious. Also, they could make the movie about the Leader and finally frigging pay off that tease from TIH that's never gone anywhere."
marvelstudios,3ds2xw,Androktone,4,Sun Jul 19 03:22:45 2015 UTC,"They do not pretend it doesn't exist.  There is RDJ, there is a Coulson-Sitwell One Shot that deals solely with the ending, Ross is in Civil War, and Ruffalo mentions Harlem.  There are Incredible Hulk clips in both Iron Man 2 and the Avengers."

marvelstudios,3ds2xw,Androktone,3,Sat Jul 18 23:07:26 2015 UTC,But it isn't at all.  They just haven't made a solo follow up and Bruce has left Betty.    I agree I would rather have seen Ruffalo from the beginning
marvelstudios,3ds2xw,Not_EdwardNorton,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:11:46 2015 UTC,"I fell that the Betty sub-plot was such a big part of the movie, that it shows that Marvel may be acknowledging the overall events of the movie and some characters like Ross, but not things like actors, relations between characters, the guy who had Hulk-blood drip in his head wound etc."
marvelstudios,3ds2xw,FlameyFlame,2,Sat Jul 18 23:17:59 2015 UTC,"I feel if they were going to put that much effort into the film, that they'd also change/retcon other things, like the relationship between Betty and Banner should have been toned down as it effects nothing in the MCU and is replaced with the (in my humble opinion) better relationship between Black widow and Banner, as well as other sub-plots that go nowhere. In the end if they were to change the film to be more in line of what the MCU has become then you'd have a completely different movie, with a few exceptions to some events/characters. Not that I'm against that though."
marvelstudios,3ds2xw,martymcSOOfly,2,Sat Jul 18 23:22:56 2015 UTC,Phase 4 movie perhaps with Hulk stranded somewhere and having flashbacks from TIH and forward perhaps?

marvelstudios,3dmfh7,mwriteword,53,Fri Jul 17 14:38:12 2015 UTC,"whoaaa very cool point. i didn't even think of it like that. What's more is that Hank becomes Yellowjacket later in the comics, though it's much different than the film version.

It feels more cinematic and event like to me when they do those and this one at the Triskellion was amazing. Michael Douglas looked great and the Peggy and Howard cameos were awesome.

marvelstudios,3dmfh7,MyBearHands,260,Sat Jul 18 01:33:27 2015 UTC,One little thing I noticed and really liked: all of the self deprecating jokes from the trailer were taken out of the movie. It made Scott seem more proud of his new powers instead of making fun of them.
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,Inspace96,198,Fri Jul 17 14:13:35 2015 UTC,Yeah Peyton Reed said they decided to cut them because the movie needs to believe in itself and not dismiss the powers and characters at their expense
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,MyBearHands,144,Fri Jul 17 14:17:17 2015 UTC,"And I actually thought those jokes were really funny in the trailer, and probably got more people interested in the movie, but the full movie works better without them. So I think it's pretty cool we got to see both."

Amazingly inventive action sequences we've never seen before. (Fighting inside a briefcase in free-fall!) Lots of humor, which really worked. Seemed family friendly, maybe even more so than other MCU films. Agent Carter cameo, and implying decades of superhero activity throughout the Cold War. Other great cameos and MCU references. One of our heroes actually remembers he knocked out and tied up a guard and saves him before the facility implodes!  Not sure I have ever seen that before.  James Bond would have let him die.  Really emphasizes the heroic nature of the characters.   Things I didn't like:   Implying that Cross was turning evil because of exposure to Pym particles.  I wish he had directly refuted that when Hope brought it up.  Just let him be a person making terrible choices of his own free will."

marvelstudios,3dmfh7,Nickerdoodle,13,Fri Jul 17 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"I could see Ant-Man 2 exploring more of Pym's past with SHIELD, Stark and Carter. Feige said if possible they'll slip Ant-Man 2 into Phase III somewhere, but I'd rather they not cram it in."
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,TLKv3,49,Fri Jul 17 20:24:18 2015 UTC,"I would argue the reason Cross was slowly warping into a crazed lunatic was the prolonged exposure to constantly trying to re-create the Pym Particle over the years. Remember, he's been doing it for a decade at least and his scientists most likely got rotated around him so they never were really around it consistently enough to be effected.  Cross, however, was ALWAYS around the serums trying to perfect it. The toxic fumes of the imperfect Pym Particle most likely distorted his brain."
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,andrey_b,35,Fri Jul 17 17:58:28 2015 UTC,"This was my understanding of that line, and it makes sense. However, I do agree that--from a storytelling perspective--I'd rather Cross have less trumped-up reasons for being evil.  This is a major drawback of MCU films in general. The best villains are in the TV shows."
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,TLKv3,39,Fri Jul 17 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"I can understand that complaint however I don't really mind the villains being one note. Its never entirely bothered me. Not everyone in the world is evil and has an interesting/complex backstory. They're just pieces of shit for the sake of it.  Cross wanted Hank to understand him and be proud. Be the father Cross wanted him to be in terms of his successes. He wanted praise. All he got was Hank's backlash of emotion from his wife ""dying"" in front of him much like Hope received.  It burned Cross inside and made him want to get back at Hank by doing the one thing Hank never wanted anyone to do.  There's complexity to these kinds of villains when you understand the broader range of why they're doing their actions even if you can't see it at first. You just have to look for it and piece it together yourself.  Sometimes you don't have to blatantly say why a person is an asshole. You should be able to sum up the parts yourself and figure it out."
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,andrey_b,16,Fri Jul 17 18:17:36 2015 UTC,"Cross wanted Hank to understand him and be proud. Be the father Cross wanted him to be in terms of his successes. He wanted praise. All he got was Hank's backlash of emotion from his wife ""dying"" in front of him much like Hope received.  It burned Cross inside and made him want to get back at Hank by doing the one thing Hank never wanted anyone to do.   I got that from the movie, and it 100% explains his desire to surpass Pym and get revenge. What it doesn't explain is why he likes murdering people or transferring super-weapons to terrorists."
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,Zarosian_Emissary,7,Fri Jul 17 18:32:59 2015 UTC,"He hates Hank at this point. Hank was SHIELD, and while he wasn't exactly fond of SHIELD anymore, Hyrda getting ahold of this type of tech was basically his second greatest fear (losing his daughter being the greatest). So bringing Hank to the lab and showing him that Cross was going to sell the tech to Anti-SHIELD terrorists is exactly what he'd do.  Murdering people was probably a mix of the particles getting to him over the years and the fact that his hatred of Hank was so all-consuming that he just didn't care anymore. He'd be happy to get rid of anyone he saw standing in his way of getting revenge on Hank."
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,BobFreakingSaget,73,Fri Jul 17 21:30:49 2015 UTC,"In regards to the Pym particles changing Darren, I don't think that's too far fetched. After all Hank did develop huge mental issues in the comics due to them if I'm not mistaken."
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,donatello_vs_batman,40,Fri Jul 17 15:14:07 2015 UTC,But Cross didn't really use the particles as much as Hank ever did.  He seemed evil before he even perfected the formula and used it on himself.
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,CityzenErased,63,Fri Jul 17 16:37:04 2015 UTC,You can argue that since he didn't perfect it yet the mind altering effects of his prototype serum were way stronger than Hank's actual serum.
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,CAVEMENvsASTRONAUTS,48,Fri Jul 17 16:47:37 2015 UTC,"Didn't Hank say something along the lines of how the helmet was key?  Perhaps to prevent damage?  I also want to know how it strained Hanks body to be able to do it anymore.  It was a pretty general ""I'm too old for this ish"" type of line."
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,LouisIV,14,Fri Jul 17 17:33:13 2015 UTC,"It's possible the strain came upon Hank, and then he altered the helmet to better protect the user. It's also possible that going small has some unknown effects on the body (maybe in a similar vain to space travel). Then there's also the idea that Hank needed to be present at the conference so Scott needed to be the one doing the heist. But yeah, it was definitely a ""I'm too old for this stuff"" line"
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,High_Stream,23,Fri Jul 17 21:15:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think he was evil just because of the particles, Pym said he was already unstable. The particles probably just tipped him over the edge."
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,drelos,11,Fri Jul 17 16:33:05 2015 UTC,"He was a piece of sh&t before the particles, he left Pym without his industry before he dealt with the particles."

marvelstudios,3dmfh7,qyasogk,39,Fri Jul 17 18:47:32 2015 UTC,"Antony was awesome... I loved all the ant stuff, especially how they took advantage of how many different kinds of ants there actually are.  The ""strange looking dog"" ant was also awesome... I'm glad the daughter got to keep him for a pet. But what do you feed that thing?"
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,d3r3k1449,25,Sat Jul 18 02:19:31 2015 UTC,"Well, clearly, the answer to that is whatever is on Cassie's plate that she does not want."
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,WildLudicolo,7,Sat Jul 18 06:28:12 2015 UTC,"Apparently, even though the ant should be made of a completely different kind of matter than any of the food it is being fed.  Whatever, comic book science!"

marvelstudios,3dmfh7,ksaid1,92,Fri Jul 17 14:02:24 2015 UTC,If this is a taste of Dr Strange then Dr Strange is gonna be yum :d
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,surgingchaos,57,Fri Jul 17 14:25:30 2015 UTC,Haha yeah. Doctor Strange is easily my most anticipated Phase 3 movie so seeing the microverse was an awesome reference to the whole parallel dimensions Feige was talking about.  People were freaking out over the Spider-Man reference in the theater but the microverse was the better part that had me tripping out.
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,marksizzle,24,Fri Jul 17 15:28:50 2015 UTC,I've heard that you can see a silhouette of a person while Scott is in there. Complete with a cape. I'm gonna have to go watch it again now!
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,TriggerHippie77,18,Fri Jul 17 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"Yep. Absolutely you can. Saw it on his way down and on his way back up. Looked almost like the silhouette has a large collar, maybe Dr Strange or the Watcher?"
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,Towerrs,16,Fri Jul 17 23:00:53 2015 UTC,Fox has the rights to the Watcher :(
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,thedoge,10,Sat Jul 18 03:34:19 2015 UTC,It was Janet. The silhouette had four wings like Wasp

marvelstudios,3dmfh7,travel_takeover,33,Sat Jul 18 12:55:00 2015 UTC,"Yes! I found it genuinely shocking. And then how he flushed him down the toilet. Ugh.

marvelstudios,3dmfh7,dra39437,72,Fri Jul 17 15:56:50 2015 UTC,I'm sure she's more than okay with the cameo considering she's getting a whole second season to Agent Carter! The more exposure her character gets the better
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,36,Fri Jul 17 16:27:10 2015 UTC,I think I read somewhere that in winter soldier the age transformation is all cgi. That she's just sitting there with markers on her face. I'd imagine if that's the case they'd do the same for this one.

marvelstudios,3dmfh7,Inspace96,66,Fri Jul 17 19:15:31 2015 UTC,My wife made the comment that she saw wings during the deep dive in to the subatomic journey. Did anyone else see this? Indication original Wasp is still out there and connected as both time and space are non-existent/irrelevant.
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,crapusername47,45,Fri Jul 17 14:02:49 2015 UTC,I definitely saw a silhouette of a person but on my rewatch I'll definitely keep an eye out for wings.
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,rbizzle83,39,Fri Jul 17 14:11:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think they went to the trouble of never showing her face just to forget about her.

The movie freaking opens with a flashback scene with Peggy and Howard Stark I was literally like ""NO WAY!!!"" when they were flying towards the ""abandoned Stark storage facility"" and it ended up being the New Avengers HQ from Age of Ultron I was literally thinking, ""Wow, I can't believe that I am actually watching an epic fight between Falcon and Ant-Man right now"" Of course, minor Sokovia references (though that was expected) When Darren Cross reveals that he was going to sell the Yellowjacket suits to Hydra, AND the SHIELD agent that Hank punched at the beginning ended actually being Hydra as well And most importantly, I came to see Ant-Man, I was NOT expecting to see FUCKING FALCON, BUCKY, AND MOTHAFUCKIN CAPTAIN AMERICA.

And it may be the best Infinity Stone-free villain death yet. Cross was way too mad to be simply given a ""disney death"". He's the first one I seen who defaults to taking things exceptionally cruel and personal.

marvelstudios,3dmfh7,dehron,20,Fri Jul 17 16:19:02 2015 UTC,Ohhhhh!  That's what Cap said.  I didn't hear it clearly.  Accords makes a lot of sense though

marvelstudios,3dmfh7,identitycrisis1,73,Fri Jul 17 13:54:41 2015 UTC,Falcon was looking for him and asked the journalist if she knew anybody who could shrink and she  went to Penas friend who went to Pena and he said Yes.  Basically Falcon knows about Lang now and where he is.

I loved his portrayal, and it really felt like without him the film woulda been some forgetful ""early 90's rendition superhero"" movie.  Obviously it is expected with a veteran actor, but Douglas' scenes, with Cross, Hope, and even Lang really made me feel like the moments in the film were had real weight."

marvelstudios,3dmfh7,revelshade,23,Sat Jul 18 03:15:58 2015 UTC,Well narratively it really was Pym's movie. Every character is largely defined by their relationship to him and his work.

marvelstudios,3dmfh7,delta835,18,Fri Jul 17 20:02:12 2015 UTC,"-May just be Marvel's funniest film to date, me and my buddies were laughing our asses off here; the comedy is on point!  -Darren Cross is definitely what the Iron Man villains should've been who IMO were all bark and no bite. We get to see just what he's capable of and how far he is willing to go with his plans, all before the epic finale showdown.  -The Antman vs Falcon scene is one of the highlights, hands down.  -If you're worried about this film pulling an AoU with only one credits stinger, fear not. Trust me, you will want to stay all the way to the end of the credits, I think I fangasmed out loud when it played out.  Final verdict: I'm really leaning towards an 8/10 here!!!"
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,009reloaded,37,Sat Jul 18 01:51:49 2015 UTC,"WOW.  I keep going to these things saying ""Wow, this is weird, I wonder if they can pull it off!"" Thor, gods and magic? Weird. Cap, a old time movie? Weird. Avengers, putting all those things together? Awesome, but weird. Guardians? REALLY weird. And now Ant-Man.  I always think at least a small level of skepticism is always a good thing, but you'd think by now I'd have learned that Marvel takes 'weird' and turns it into something special every damn time.  With each successive movie being bigger than the last (I mean, yeah Age of Ultron was kind of nuts), I wondered whether or not Marvel would only every tell the smaller, more personal stories on their TV or Netflix shows. Would we get something like the original Iron Man ever again?  I think we just did. I'll be honest, I was a little worried when the who directoral thing blew up. I had faith it would be good, my leave favourite movie of the MCU, Iron Man 2, was still ok. But would it end up feeling disjointed, like pieces were missing? NOPE. Not at all. This might be one of the most structurally sound and cohesive movies Marvel has put out - up there with Guardians and Winter Soldier.   They keep doing this thing where they take a superhero idea, break it down into characters and genre, then pump up the genre as best they can and put the LARGE emphasis of the story on the characters (you know, the way it should be done). It keeps on working, and it worked here. Paul Rudd really sells the 'average guy' shtick while still looking like a superhero when the time calls for it. Douglas was really great, he has that sort of air to him that Redford had in TWS. I will FUCKING RIOT if Michael Pena doesn't come back in some form, he was hands down the funniest fucking part of the movie. Rest of the supporting cast was great, and it was nice to just see a bunch of 'average' archetypes of different people.  Separate paragraph here for Evangeline as Hope because I basically had to constrain myself from shrieking at that first post credits sequence. I figured they would eventually do Wasp, that's all I really hoped for, but to have confirmation that Janet WAS the Wasp (and is totally fucking alive, they didn't show her face in her sequence and photo for a REASON), but for there also to be a nearly done modern Wasp suit and HOPE IS GOING TO BE A SUPERHERO?? I really, really hope that once the movie hype dies down and most people have seen it, that Marvel announces Evangeline is going to be in Civil War. They can't pull the trigger on something as AWESOME as Wasp and not use the idea right away.  I thought Stroll was good as the villain. Marvel seems to have a sliding scale of ""Villain has some of the best personality of the movie and it complex"" (Loki, Red Skull, Ultron) or ""Villain sorta feels villain-of-the-week ish) (Ronan, Malekith, Whiplash). Some are in between though, like Obadiah from Iron Man 1. And it's fitting that Ant Man's villain would remind me of him, since the whole movie reminds me of Iron Man. He didn't have a whole lot of complexity but he had an astoundingly threatening presence in every scene he was in. Not the best villain Marvel has had, but he was pretty solid.   The effects were sooooo cool! I'm not exactly sure how they managed to make the shrinking and enlarged world feel both tremendously exotic and fantastical and 'normal' and comfortable at the same time, but they did it. It was a blast to see, but it didn't feel hammy or strangely out of left field.   I liked the flow of the plot - I remember it not feeling like a traditional three act structure while I was watching, but now when I think back it really was. The training montage was great and the fight scenes were fantastic. And by slimming down the grandness of the story, I actually felt the stakes were a lot more real. I was ACTUALLY pretty nervous about Hank during the standoff, and I thought Paxton might bite it at the end.   As for the Marvel references....PEGGY <3 And seeing John Slattery back as Howard was AWESOME! The ""Just call the Avengers man"" was pretty funny, and Hank's justification for not TOTALLY made sense. The bit at the Avenger's facility...HOLY shit I did not expect that. I was 'spoiled' by TV spots about Falcon being in the movie, but I thought it was going to be at the END of the film. This is probably the most time a 'solo' movie has spent trespassing into and wading around in Avenger's waters, and it 110% worked. It reminded me of early Agents of SHIELD, that these guys are really just existing in this world and doing their own stuff. The Stan Lee cameo was great. Music was so much fun :D And...yeah, ok I'll admit it. Guardians made me almost cry over a tree? Ant-Man made me almost cry over an Ant. Have at it.  And now the post-credits scenes. Yeah I know I already talked about the Wasp one, too bad I wanna talk about it more. The suit looks amazing, and it was a nice show of Hank's character development, and I LOVED that Hope never backed down from the idea once. ""About damn time"", fuck yes.  Aaaaand the post-post scene. Holy shit. Did not see that coming. How do they keep these things a secret, exactly? Mackie was in other parts of the movie, ok, but they keep him and Evens and Stan being on set a SECRET? I didn't exactly catch Cap's line, but something about Tony not being able to help them because of 'accords' [??] sounds like serious Civil War building. I wonder if it had anything to do with what went down during the movie itself! And Bucky. Oh man D: How am I gonna wait until Civil War??  All in all, that was fantastic. I think part of the reason Marvel keeps being so successful with these is that they don't just keep going up, they spread outwards and try new things. This movie had the Iron Man 1 feel, but with the rest of the Cinematic Universe already established. It stayed small, personal, and and insanely funny, but still had a massive ""Hey! We still exist!"" from the Avengers. This really did exceed my expectations."
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,identitycrisis1,10,Fri Jul 17 22:41:49 2015 UTC,"The reason no one knew about Chris Evans is because he wasn't there. That scene is a clip from Civil War (although it's contents may change, it's still in production.)"

And then we freaking got it, and it was so good.  My initial reaction was I actually enjoyed this one even more than AoU, it was just so refreshing, the whole heist theme was well executed and the humor was a little slow to start but then it was on point for the last 3/4 of the movie.  I also went in wanting 3 specific things:  Wasp in action, check. Spidey reference, check. Civil War set up, holy shit check.  Overall, this one probably solidifies my top 5 as Winter Soldier, GotG, Avengers, Iron Man, and Ant-Man"

Titanic is now in MCU canon and the mentioned DiCaprio by name? Does this mean that Leo can't be in the MCU in the future? :( That would put my 3 favorite actors (Liam Neeson and Joseph Gordon-Levitt rounding it out since they were in the TDK trilogy) against odds of being in the MCU. I really liked the origin story, people were complaining the past two years about origin stories, but even though I still might like The First Avenger and Thor more (MCU ranking pending after only one viewing!), it's the best origin super hero movie since Iron Man IMO. Pretty funny stuff throughout, loved the Basken Robins bit with the dude trying to buy a burger. Everyone seems to love Pena but I don't know, half of his stuff seemed forced to me. T.I. was good enough for me to not be like ""hey that's TI"" like I do the musicians in the Fast & Furious movies. Really really want an Ant-Man 2 now. Fiege plz it's not too late, you already said it's possible we'll get a sequel before 2020, and Rudd will be 50 by then anyway. Please bring back Cross, Stoll acted the heck out of that part. He made me more uncomfortable than Ultron, probably because Stoll is a real person lol. Expand him as a villain, explore the microverse bur bring back the 3 wombats and Hope as well! Loved the post credit scene. I've seen some say it's mid-Civil War, but I'll put my money on it taking place before the movie.  Speaking of Cap and friends, I loved having the Falcon in the movie. Sure Daredevil had it's Easter eggs and GotG had Thanos for like 45 seconds but having Falcon actually fight really got my MCU unit excited."
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,BoxDroppingManApe,62,Fri Jul 17 13:37:29 2015 UTC,"Well, Ron Burgandy was mentioned in AoS so,technically, Rudd is also in the MCU canon, as well as Sam L Jackson through Star Wars references and Evangeline Lilly through Lord of the Rings references.  And I feel like they spent less time on his actual origin than the other origin stories. He got into being Ant-Man pretty quickly, all things considered. I just hope we get a sequel soon.

marvelstudios,3dmfh7,Skeuomorphic_,10,Sun Jul 19 05:59:22 2015 UTC,"Personally I felt this was a very fun movie and had quite a few memorable moments from the briefcase fight scene to the training montage and more. Michael Pena was great in his role, even remembering to save the guard, and there were plenty of moments the audience was laughing out loud or all gasping together over Antony.  I felt it was a nice origins movie for the character and I think we’re just now setting ourselves up where every Marvel movie has to be this grand epic piece and so something like this which is great in its own right will be looked down upon by some. It’s one of the first Marvel movies my better half has said she has thoroughly enjoyed from beginning to end as a non-comic fan as well too. So there’s that.  Finally I’ll add in Hope getting her surprise from Hank at the end and the neat easter egg of what I swore was her mother in the micro verse scene along with Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas nailing their characters and I am and was sold."
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,lightbluestar,10,Fri Jul 17 18:44:54 2015 UTC,"Just got back from seeing it. Ant-dog is the hero we need in the MCU. If he doesn't finish Thanos off at the end of IW, I will be forever disappointed.  I like how they incorporated Falcon into the movie, and not just through a post credits scene. I saw a TV spot a few times featuring him, and I legitimately though I had the end-credits scene spoiled. That was my favorite part, the whole fight scene.  Winter Soldier made me really excited. Now I'm even more on the Hype Train for Civil War.  Overall, good movie, and it's going to smash through everyone's doubts about it being the first flop.

marvelstudios,3dmfh7,rooney815,23,Fri Jul 17 14:23:47 2015 UTC,"Not sure which one you're referring to so I'll explain both.   Hank gives Hope an advanced prototype of his wife Janet's Wasp suit, suggesting she is going to take over as the new Wasp. Wasp has similar abilities to Ant-Man except she can fly and project energy blasts.  After they said they'd had no luck in Age of Ultron, Captain America and the Falcon have found and captured Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier. However, they need help. Sam says they could have gone to Tony a short time ago but due to 'the accords' they can't. Instead, Sam says he 'knows a guy', presumably referring to Ant-Man.    My assumption is that after Sovokia and the Ultron incident the Avengers cannot act unilaterally anymore as they have agreed not to. As a result, Cap and Sam need to keep Bucky's capture off the radar. To do this, they might require help from someone not on any old S.H.I.E.L.D lists or indexes, like Scott."
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,Holodout,5,Fri Jul 17 14:36:50 2015 UTC,"I think that Tony and Steve are already at odds, actually."
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,rooney815,23,Fri Jul 17 15:15:36 2015 UTC,"It's supposedly a scene from Civil War. Cap and Falcon have finally tracked down Bucky and captured him (maybe after a fight) and are trying to figure out what to do next. They mention they can't contact Stark with the ""accords"" and that the whole situation would've been easier about a week ago. So they are probably underground by that point and hiding from the super hero registration act.   Falcon says he knows a guy that can help (referring to Ant-Man)"
marvelstudios,3dmfh7,Holodout,10,Fri Jul 17 14:32:43 2015 UTC,"I was a little confused, what exactly did they need “help” with in regards to Tony which could be substituted for Scott? Like, did they find Bucky with his arm stuck in that machine and need help getting him out and need a tech guy to do so? Or did they capture him, lock him into that machine and need a scientist to help restore his mind or something? Do they need someone with money or persuasion to help convince people to give Bucky a chance at rehabilitation?"

marvelstudios,3dscjc,JuanRiveara,4,Sun Jul 19 00:13:20 2015 UTC,It's really more of question for /r/Marvel. Ask them if you haven't already.
marvelstudios,3dscjc,itssnick,2,Sun Jul 19 00:30:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, true. I visit this one so much I kinda forgot there was another sub for Marvel. >_>"
marvelstudios,3dscjc,JuanRiveara,3,Sun Jul 19 00:32:50 2015 UTC,"I would love to see Marvel and Star Wars appear in the game, but I'll admit, there is part of me that wants to see the series stay pure Disney. Honestly, though, I don't think incorporating a Marvel world would be anything too difficult, even if it's an MCU one.  I can easily picture a scenario where the Gummi Ship crosses paths with the Milano, or maybe has to make an emergency landing on Knowhere for new parts, where Sora and company go and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy in the process.  An Asgard world might work pretty well too, but I'd imagine that would be a scenario where you have to help Thor stop Loki's shenanigans. Under that concept, Loki would probably make a Frost Giant/Heartless army or something similar to that idea.  Square probably could pull off a New York world under a Battle of New York scenario from the Avengers, but I have a hard time seeing that happen, because to suddenly go to a real world city after jumping back and forth between places like Halloween Town and Wonderland seems off to me.   There is Sokovia, however, so maybe they could do something where you team up with the Avengers to fight a Heartless-infused Ultron. In fact, they could do something similar to the 1000 Heartless Battle from Kingdom Hearts II, where Sora, Donald, Goofy and the Avengers take on an onsalught of Ultron bots just like the scene toward the end of Age of Ultron (the PS4 and Xbox One should be able to handle that no problem).  So yeah, the MCU can show up in Kingdom Hearts III without feeling out of place. But I think the chances of Marvel anything, and Star Wars anything for that matter, making an appearance depends on Square wanting to include those properties and having the resources to do so."
marvelstudios,3dscjc,420_BonerHitler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:22:54 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Square would want both in. It would sell even more units if both were announced, it would definitely be worth their while. It would come down to if they could implement into the game well."
marvelstudios,3dscjc,TheInShaneOne,2,Sun Jul 19 02:35:07 2015 UTC,I've wanted that since KH3 was announced. Star Wars too.
marvelstudios,3dscjc,Johninfinityman,2,Sun Jul 19 02:13:42 2015 UTC,"Here's a poll I've made, check it out, if you want!  I posted it on /r/KingdomHearts as well, to see what the two fanbases would think."
marvelstudios,3dn5sf,encom_cto,21,Fri Jul 17 17:02:50 2015 UTC,Cool. They finally announced it. I guess it comes in the orb.
marvelstudios,3dn5sf,009reloaded,12,Fri Jul 17 17:05:46 2015 UTC,Done. I wonder what it'll actually look like. I loved the Phase 1 set so I definitely need to get this one.
marvelstudios,3dn5sf,ricincig,14,Fri Jul 17 17:24:00 2015 UTC,So... is it just the Orb? Or does it come with the arms? Very confusing

marvelstudios,3dp7t5,_Valisk,7,Sat Jul 18 06:27:53 2015 UTC,It's definitely better than people think. It came out and suddenly everyone was a HUGE Mandarin fan. But when you listen to what Shane Black says about the film and why he had the idea for the twist it all makes sense as to why it happened. Plus Marvel wasn't ever going to do the Mandarin before this idea came about so it was either this or nothing.  PLUS All Hail the King made it so there is a real Mandarin out there.
marvelstudios,3dp7t5,SToddB33,2,Sat Jul 18 14:50:33 2015 UTC,"I like it a little better after All Hail the King came out, because it literally makes no sense unless there's a real Mandarin and a real 10 Rings."
marvelstudios,3dp7t5,ItsMeTK,2,Sun Jul 19 03:16:56 2015 UTC,Well there really was a 10 Rings terrorist group that was lead by Killian because he created all of that to profit from the fallout.

I don't blame Joss for not finding the time for anything more, but those movies are all snarky lines and badass moments. Fun as hell, but I can't rank them higher. Putting Ultron at 7 feels weird, but I suspect most of my enjoyment from that movie stems from Elizabeth Olsen and Quicksilver. James Spader, the Vision, and Hawkeye make me want to rate it higher, but its impressive underusage of the Avengers themselves and its terrible editing mean I can't.  I feel like Ant-Man might be ranked too highly since it's so fresh, but there's not a dull moment in that movie. Everything from the side characters to the child actors is wonderfully well done, and it doesn't need to go past two hours to do it. It also uses all of its cast really well and gives them time for all of them to shine, which is much better than Iron Man's one-man show.  I can't forgive CA1 for putting almost all of Cap's time in the war (and almost all of his time with Bucky and the Commandos) in a fucking montage. The shot that made me want to watch the movie was the shot with Cap holding a gun and his shield leading the Commandos in a raid."
marvelstudios,3dp7t5,xrayandvav,6,Sat Jul 18 05:54:59 2015 UTC,"Winter Soldier - excellent spy/political/thriller movie. Best MCU film so far in my opinon.  Age of Ultron - IMO the first avengers was dry in the first hour but brought it alive for the battle of newyork ... but in age of ultron i was captivated for the whole ride.  Guardians of the Galaxy - love take of the universal/space side of the marvel world but im bias because space intrigues me due to mass effect and interstellar etc.  Ant Man - comedy was amazing every time paul rudd was on the screen, and then it became serious when he wasn't on screen. I loved the back and forth with that in this film.  Avengers - Nice build up and team up of characters of the movies we loved.  Iron Man - classic and nice way to start off the MCUniverse  Iron Man 2 - I'm okay if they rushed this movie just for the sake of trying to get ready to build the MCU The Incredible Hulk - I feel neutral about this one.  Captain America - decent movie, weird montage of  destroying hydra bases though Iron Man 3 ..... the mandarin twist was BS ..... and a weird way to start phase 2 Thor ..... felt rushed to bring out the avengers movie but hey we still love him  Thor 2..... Im sorry thor fans but they could have done better."

It's pretty high for me because it's so different from anything we've ever seen before. I came in thinking the ants were going to be cheesy, but they were easily my favorite part of the film.

marvelstudios,3doag0,p-longstocking,24,Fri Jul 17 22:10:39 2015 UTC,"I've read somewhere before, that Feige's dream was to be like George Lucas during the original SW trilogy. If you know anything about the making of Empire or Jedi, know that GL only had vague ideas about what he wanted to do, Kasdan wrote the scripts and GL approved the ideas he felt were actually better than his own. The directors for both films were hired guns with GL coming to set every so often to look over their shoulders, and GL had the final say in the editing process and in the quality of the special effects.  It is exactly how Feige runs Marvel Studios. Feige and the other members of the producing team decide what characters to use and the vague outline of the story and what genre the story should be and then choose the writer and director, if the writer or director come up with better ideas, they use those. Feige and his team have the final say in the editing room.  The reason for the higher quality of the MCU franchise and also the issues with how the critics say everything is too samey with underdeveloped villains is all on Feige"
marvelstudios,3doag0,bingbongddildo,6,Fri Jul 17 22:44:31 2015 UTC,"The underdeveloped villains is basically a mixture of bad things, to be honest.  While you DO have Feige having final say in the board room,  the writing of the script itself, characters and all, is in the hands of the director(s) and screenwriter(s). Plus, you have to fit all this story and character development into a 2-2.5 hr movie. That's fucking hard, no matter how skilled you are as a script writer. Another thing to note is source material. One thing the MCU has going against it is the villain draw. While the Spidey deal with Sony opens things up a bit, none of the MCU villains really recognizable to anyone outside of the comic fandom. Likewise, the source material never really developed most of them from their generic ""I hate good guys"" mantra that they were born with at Marvel's inception.  While I won't argue anybody on their quality (eye of the beholder and whatnot), let's not pretend that it's one singular issue that the studio can suddenly flip on a dime and suddenly start churning out awesome villains."
marvelstudios,3doag0,Irishman318,7,Sat Jul 18 03:56:53 2015 UTC,"I remember reading a review a long time ago during the campy batman movies of the 90s that said, the villains are more entertaining, charismatic and interesting than the hero. My theory is that the MCU is a reaction to this. The hero is front and center with the character development, charisma and etc. The villains are just a minor roadblock, a sideshow."
marvelstudios,3doag0,razzy1319,10,Sat Jul 18 05:07:28 2015 UTC,"If I'm going to see an Iron Man movie, or a Guardians movie, I want it to be about Iron Man or the Guardians of the Galaxy. What I need to know about the villain is what they want to do, and why that is against the hero. I'm simplifying a bit here, but on the whole, I personally don't have a problem with the MCU villains.   I don't really know what side of this you're coming down on, but I would rather have a movie about the heroes than the villains."
marvelstudios,3doag0,yodamann,4,Sat Jul 18 05:21:54 2015 UTC,"This is where DC needs to step in to create some competition, which they have a better chance to, seeing as how they have all their eggs in one basket. Suicide squad could be a breakthrough where you sympathize with all these villains and their struggles and want to actually see them succeed.   However, and IMO, the showings so far have been a mixed bag for me. Lex Luthor isn't looking as impressive as he could in BvS, and as much as I want it to break the mold, Joker may overshadow everyone in SS to the point where everyone jut sees him as the bad guy."
marvelstudios,3doag0,Irishman318,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:29:23 2015 UTC,"Likewise, the source material never really developed most of them from their generic ""I hate good guys"" mantra that they were born with at Marvel's inception.   Yeah, like...the Red Skull is a great villain, but the thing is is that he's supposed to be a generic evil Nazi who's entire shtick is that he hates good guys. There's no internal struggle to the Red Skull."
marvelstudios,3doag0,ContinuumGuy,2,Sat Jul 18 16:14:21 2015 UTC,Let's hope Feige doesn't end up like Lucas.
marvelstudios,3doag0,The_Best_01,-8,Sat Jul 18 08:08:03 2015 UTC,"I always think of Feige as wannabe Tony Stark, he loves the hype and all the attention."
marvelstudios,3doag0,silvershadow881,7,Fri Jul 17 23:50:05 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly in the last interview with the Thor TDW director he said he was given complete creative control, so it's not like Marvel coaches their directors every step of the way (look at GoTG, couldn't be more James Gunn).   I think the problem might be that directors have a certain vision and direction of certain aspects of their movies, but Marvel can't have a cohesive universe adjusting to every single decision a director makes, rather the directors adjust to the universe.  I understand how it could put some people off, but to be honest, working on a Marvel movie has become more than ""making a spin-off"" in a shared universe, it is more like making a sequel in a series that already had 10 movies. If a director really wants a character to develop in a certain way, but Marvel has planned for that to be meaningless in a couple of movies, then why confuse the audience?  Take a recent example with Ironman 3. Many people I talk to still don't understand why Stark ""quit"" at the end of IM3 but appears like nothing happened in AoU. This is clearly an issue with how the ending in IM3 was handled because he never meant to quit, and while it worked in IM3 it felt sudden for fans that didn't understand. Worse yet, in AoU there were many things to tackle more important that clearing up the ending of IM3, so they were left feeling as if IM3 was ignored."
marvelstudios,3doag0,bingbongddildo,5,Sat Jul 18 00:31:28 2015 UTC,"The TDW director said, ""The Marvel experience was particularly wrenching because I was sort of given absolute freedom while we were shooting, and then in post it turned into a different movie. So, that is something I hope never to repeat and don’t wish upon anybody else.”  http://www.ew.com/article/2015/06/30/terminator-genisys-alan-taylor-marvel-complaint?hootPostID=69b68b57e65717059644404d4ecff7f2  If Feige and team likes what you bring they let you go for it, they then bend it to what they want it to be in the edit.  James Gunn had such a good time because they genuinely like what he brings, but even he has said he had arguments during the edits."

Even before Captain America. His suit uses Pym Particles that allow him to shrink and grow to his will. When he's small, he still carries his mass, so his punches are the same force as if he were regular sized. He can also control ants.  *pushes glasses further up nose  Hank Pym is the original Ant Man. Scott Lang then takes up the mantle. In this movie, Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang and he has to fight the Yellowjacket, who can also shrink and grow. Michael Douglas plays Hank Pym and Evangaline Lily plays Hope, who is speculated to be Wasp, who has the same abilities as Ant Man, but can also fly."

However, I personally think there is an alright chance of X-Men returning by 2025, a decade may be seem long but it's reasonable. The difference between FOX and Sony is that Sony is in a financial struggle while FOX isn't but if FOX doesn't deem their movies worth making anymore they won't make them anymore."

marvelstudios,3dpupi,KebraWolfsbane,7,Sat Jul 18 07:40:16 2015 UTC,They can't say the x men or fantastic 4 died  They don't have the rights  And I prefer the MCU to be a pure and streamlined universe without ultimate and 616 baggage
marvelstudios,3dpupi,faggot_human_trash,4,Sat Jul 18 07:55:24 2015 UTC,I don't really see a point. Your main points were:   they can explain why the F4 and X-men don't exist; but this can't be done because they don't own the rights. they can make the heroes fight each other; but they do this all the time. We have Civil War and both Avengers movies had small fights between the members. It can unify the comics and movies; this would be hella confusing for people who don't know what comics are. The whole point of the movies is to show a different take on the comic book stories.
marvelstudios,3dpupi,TwitchyCookie,2,Sat Jul 18 08:39:16 2015 UTC,"I've heard someone at Marvel say something to this affect about how the MCU connects to the rest of the Marvel Omniverse (I can't recall who exactly). This is paraphrased:  The question posed was: Does the current Secret Wars event have any connection at all to the MCU? Many seem to think that the two entities are mutually exclusive.  Answer: ""Well, who's to say they aren't connected? Maybe the events of the MCU are ancient history by the time 616 comes into play. Or maybe the MCU is a distant future after Secret Wars. It's an interesting question; stay tuned to find out.""   Now I know that this ""hearsay"" at best (because I can't remember the source), but if that is true then we could possibly get a connection sometime in the future. I've heard that time is different on each universe within the Marvel Multiverse so it is possible that the MCU will eventually ""catch up"" or ""slow down"" to the current Secret Wars event. (I'm pretty sure the source was either an artist or comic book writer who was a semi-recent convention or expo)"

marvelstudios,3dpupi,goodbrock,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:40:23 2015 UTC,"There have been several posts about how marvel could add in x-men and fantastic 4 with one of the comic book story lines (not a comic reader here). At first I was open to it but the more I think about it the more I don't want that. If marvel gets the rights to fantastic 4 they can just throw them in. If they get the rights to x-men. Just give them their own universe. The mxcu. Then they can start this whole thing from scratch. They are growing as a company so what's to say they couldn't add the manpower to do it. Merging universes would be so confusing and I can't see how they would give the characters the attention they deserve. If I have a complaint of the existing MCU it's that.   I don't read the comics and I'm sure if you have the merging stuff seems like a neat idea because you've seen it before but from a non-reader, I don't want it."
marvelstudios,3dpupi,jessybear2344,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:00:26 2015 UTC,Read Secret Wars again because that's not how it works. There are no more Incursions. There are no more Earths. There is only Battleworld and the will of God King Doom! You can see Earth-199999  (Mcu) in a Nova comic where the Watcher looks at some screens and on one of them you can see Earth-199999. So this Earth is already destroyed.
marvelstudios,3dpupi,Shadow_Gabriel,0,Sat Jul 18 11:18:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean specifically saying "" where's x-men? Oh don't worry they died"", it would just be a conclusion that if you didn't see them there, they died. Also, addressing the Incursions stuff, I'm not fully sure they are over, but they might be. The fight between members thing I mean sayhulk against hulk, or so on and so forth."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,murdockmanila,140,Thu Jul 16 15:59:30 2015 UTC,That Main Title IS outstanding.
marvelstudios,3dimq8,Frostguard11,-61,Thu Jul 16 16:24:07 2015 UTC,"Ok, who should be Doctor Strange. Recent words was that it's Ewen McGregor. Others rumored were Ryan Gosling. One choice is Liam Neeson, he has a mystical look and also was Ra's Al Ghoul. He kind of adds an element to the Marvel Universe that it doesn't have which is gravitas and serious presence. But he may be too old for the role - yeah, he's a timeless, aging character. But come on Liam Neeson will never die. Ethan Hawke is an ok choice too. He's nomitated for oscars, working constantly for decades and has the look. He looks younger than he is. Ok, fine Cumberbatch is good ok. But we've really got to stop putting him in everything. What about Captain America vs. Iron Man? Captain America is my least favorite marvel character but Iron Man will win definitely. He's a genius, he fought Thor and he fought him to a standstill. Captain America's strength is a wash against Iron Man's suit. He's also a rogue. He's going to find a way to beat Captain America. Let's also not forget that his dad helped found the Captain America program so he can definitely find a way to neutralize his super serum. I know what you're going to say. Captain America is America. He'll never back down. Tony Stark is the guy who will steal your girl. Captain America is cheeseburgers. Tony Stark is a vegan drink. Captain America is Rocky. Tony Stark is Tommy Gun. Captain America can punch through Tony Stark's head. But now, that makes no sense. Those are just metaphors. Tony Stark created Ultron in this universe - you can't beat him. One punch doesn't stop Iron Man."

marvelstudios,3dimq8,silvershadow881,-2,Thu Jul 16 18:21:26 2015 UTC,"This, I agree with. Not too much else though. Main Title is cool, but it seems so similar to Hannibal... None of the actors or writing really wowed me either. Competent but not awards-worthy."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,Bagoole,19,Thu Jul 16 19:39:20 2015 UTC,"I must disagree. Daredevil and Better Call Saul were the two best dramatic pilots this season. The episodes ""Rabbit in a Snow Storm"" and ""Shadows in the Glass"" were better written than pretty much any single episode from this year's GoT or Orange is the New Black. Not to knock those shows, but they are routinely the best written shows the past few years. Neither of them built solid single-episodes in their respective seasons. They instead resorted to various story lines, with hook after hook through the entire season.  As for acting, all I can say is ""D'Onofrio."""
marvelstudios,3dimq8,notshawnvaughn,2,Thu Jul 16 21:01:27 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with disagreeing, though I guess I should tread lightly in mentioning something Marvel is not the bee's knee's in /r/marvelstudios ... Promise you folks, I lay fresh fruit at my MCU altar every night!  I'm basically just judging Daredevil by its own right because I didn't watch much TV this season. My personal favourite episode was ""Stick.""  Not saying I disliked the show, I liked the show! But D'Onofrio's performance did nothing for me. He raspy talks, wants to save the city by selling heroine and building condos, loses his cool a lot, but most importantly just did not come off as a very competent crime boss. I was often confused as to how he ever managed to get to the top of the food chain at all. I didn't find him intimidating, and his outbursts were highly predictable.  Not a bad job, but then for that prize he was up against Elden Henson, whose line delivery was frequently so terrible I would ask the TV ""was that their best take?""  Personally, I'd give the Daredevil acting medal to Cox, or even Leonard Moore. Wesley was one of the only characters who intrigued me greatly... I was constantly thinking ""Who is this guy, where'd he come from, and why am I so concerned when he enters a scene?"" Great job there."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,Bagoole,3,Thu Jul 16 22:52:22 2015 UTC,"So you masturbate to Marvel every night?  I kid, I kid. While I still disagree, I really appreciate your articulated response. Fisk was dumb, and DD got his ass kicked a lot. They're still growing. I love Henson, but I totally understand your argument against him. He has presence, but lacks range.  Thanks for explaining yourself. I've been vocally against AoU in these parts, so I understand the courage of dissent."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,notshawnvaughn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:12:10 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with the GoT part, in my unprofessional opinion I would say both the Hardhome episode and the finale were better written than Daredevil. To be fair I am a big GoT fan but I wouldn't say the writing was the fault of this season, it was that the first half of the season was all setup for the second half but the setup was uneventful."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,JuanRiveara,2,Thu Jul 16 21:31:32 2015 UTC,"I mean...It's more the idea of single episode structure that I'm referring to when I say it's lacking. I think the writing, relative to the series, was weaker this season of GoT, but it is still fantastic work."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,notshawnvaughn,69,Thu Jul 16 21:39:25 2015 UTC,"If Daredevil can't get nominated for the larger categories it goes to show the bias away from ""superhero"" shows/movies that the Emmys and the Academy have.  I get that the Dark Knight and Heath Ledger won an Academy award, but it wasn't even nominated for Best Picture. and that's largely held as the ""best of the best"" superhero movies in terms of main stream acceptance.  It's just kind of ridiculous that someone like Vincent D'Onofrio can't even get a nomination for best supporting actor. he fucking KILLED it. I don't get why they immediately gloss over these films and shows like they don't matter to the masses.  I love the Lord of the Rings, but Return of the King was nominated and fucking WON an Oscar for best picture (and 10 other nominations and wins). If Return of the King can beat Lost in Translation, why can't The Winter Soldier even be nominated, or Daredevil be nominated for best drama series?  Homeland? come on we all know homeland has fallen off. How on earth was this season of homeland better than Daredevil?  TL:DR I know i'm preaching to the choir, but fuck me if these nominations aren't bullshit."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,MrFusionHER,21,Thu Jul 16 17:17:52 2015 UTC,"I'm betting it's actually Netflix's fault.  I'm betting they put all their ""lobbying"" behind House of Cards, Orange is the New Black and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. I'm willing to bet they hardly pushed Daredevil at all, as they figured they could garner more nominations by backing two shows that already have a ton of traction. And it paid off, considering their 34 nominations are only outpaced by HBO (untouchable, with 126) and FX for non-network TV. That's ridiculously high number of nominations considering they producer far, far less content than all of those stations.  Also, Netflix and AMC are the only networks with two shows nominated for best drama, and Netflix is tied with HBO with three shows nominated between ""Best Drama"" and ""Best Comedy"" categories.  Honestly, I think the new rules that forced OitNB into drama are what hurt Daredevil. Had OitNB been comedy still, they probably would have backed Daredevil pretty hard, and forgotten UKS, as drama is the bigger feather-in-the-cap.  I could be wrong, but I'm betting this is the case. DVD screeners and lobbying account for 90% of these nominations. BSG released their entire first season on DVD for Emmy voters, and they immediately they started to get critical acclaim. HBO puts out the best damn screener box I've ever seen: the best episodes of every show, entire films and specials, sometimes even entire seasons."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,notshawnvaughn,5,Thu Jul 16 20:46:39 2015 UTC,this is an extremely well thought out and worded answer to my mindless blabbering about being butt hurt that my favorite show wasn't nominated.  well done sir (i'm pretty sure it's sir)
marvelstudios,3dimq8,MrFusionHER,5,Thu Jul 16 20:52:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I stared my career in TV. Summer was my favorite time of year, as I could watch every pilot from pilot season before it hit the air, and soon after ""borrow"" so many HBO and cable screeners from my bosses."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,notshawnvaughn,21,Thu Jul 16 21:03:58 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, but they may be getting a little better; Tatiana Maslany is finally nominated for best actress after being snubbed for two years because she's on a sci-fi show. Orphan Black is incredible mainly because of her acting abilities and the wide range of characters she plays in every episode, but she was never nominated before because it's a show about clones. Maybe I'm being overly optimistic, but I think things are very slowly starting to turn around in favor of ""genre"" shows and movies."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,Skullman1392,5,Thu Jul 16 17:55:07 2015 UTC,"But the fact that she's so good is because it's a show about clones.  It's a gimmick, but a fucking amazing gimmick with perfect execution."

Now I don't care how many awards a show has won.  I don't care if Daredevil doesn't win a single one, because we all know how awesome the show is.  The ratings, although kept mostly under wraps by Netflix, were beyond expectations, and further cemented Netflix's role as an industry titan gaining more momentum.  Daredevil has accomplished so much that to me, it's one of the new jewels of Netflix progamming along with House of Cards, OitNB, etc."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,magopus6,8,Thu Jul 16 18:09:11 2015 UTC,"With competion this strong, I don't think Daredevil got snubbed at all. D'Onofrio was great, but with actors and shows like those, I don't mind that he wasn't nominated."

IIRC, part of the reason why the Oscars now are 8 to 10 nominees for best picture is because everybody was pissed at the fact that Dark Knight and Wall-E both didn't even get a nomination."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,ContinuumGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:05:42 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly.
marvelstudios,3dimq8,Faskil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:11:11 2015 UTC,"Winter Soldier just plain didn't deserve it. It wasn't close to any of the movies nominated for Best Picture last year.  D'Onofrio is the only nomination that Daredevil really truly deserved that they didn't get. I haven't seen all of the other shows nominated but I honestly thought he'd have a shot at a nomination, not a win though."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,hargendarsh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:37:34 2015 UTC,"Still waiting for a movie to be nominated for ""best adapted screenplay"" because comicbook movies fit that exact category."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,Worthyness,72,Fri Jul 17 03:41:10 2015 UTC,It's a shame that Vincent D'Onofrio didn't at least get nominated for best supporting actor. If Daredevil was a network show I think his chances would have been a lot better.
marvelstudios,3dimq8,theMumaw,65,Thu Jul 16 16:47:06 2015 UTC,That's not true at all. The Emmys generally gravitate towards cable or streaming shows. The genre of the show was the bigger barrier.
marvelstudios,3dimq8,IDGAFWMNI,26,Thu Jul 16 16:51:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it has a lot to do with the genre.  For example if Heath Ledger hadn't died I think its really unlikely that he would have won an Academy Award.  Its not exactly the same but there seems to be certain awards that superhero movies and TV CAN be nominated for (ie Special Effects, sound, etc.) which are much more technical and not really subjective.  On the other hand, things like best actor are 100% subjective and ruled on by high class old people for the most part.  This is why Oscar Bait movies and shows like Law and Order always get nominated for the most subjective awards like acting and screenwriting while superhero movies and TV have a harder time breaking through that barrier no matter how good it is."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,htallen,14,Thu Jul 16 18:05:21 2015 UTC,When was the last time Law & Order was nominated for an acting award?
marvelstudios,3dimq8,JuanRiveara,8,Thu Jul 16 18:11:00 2015 UTC,"4 years since its last nomination, 6 years since his last win. His reference was a bit out of date, something like The Good Wife or Downtown Abbey are the big Emmy shows these days."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,yourkindhere,2,Thu Jul 16 19:50:58 2015 UTC,The Good Wife was snubbed in most categories this year though.

marvelstudios,3dimq8,hatramroany,4,Fri Jul 17 00:56:17 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head, I can only think of twice where a ""genre"" movie won a acting award Oscar: Heath Ledger (which was, as you say, partly because of the fact he died) and Don Ameche in Cocoon (and that was partly meant to be a ""Lifetime Achievement Award"" for a guy who had been in show business since freaking Vaudeville times).   In Drama TV it's actually less rare- Lyndsay Wagner won once for Bionic Woman , Marlette Hartley won for her short stint in The Incredible Hulk (she played Banner's wife in a 2-parter, I believe), Gillian Anderson won for X-Files, Patricia Arquette for Medium, Terry O'Quinn and Michael Emerson won once each for Lost, Peter Dinklage won... and that doesn't include people who have won stuff for spy shows and such."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,ContinuumGuy,0,Thu Jul 16 22:04:29 2015 UTC,"No way, Heath Ledger would've won regardless of his death that performance was too hard for the Academy to ignore."

marvelstudios,3dimq8,ricalo_suarvalez,2,Fri Jul 17 00:35:34 2015 UTC,Yeah genre shows just don't get nominated anymore
marvelstudios,3dimq8,your_mind_aches,9,Thu Jul 16 18:30:34 2015 UTC,Not true at all. There are actors from a streaming show nominated in almost each category. Amazon even had a show and an actor nominated.
marvelstudios,3dimq8,TriggerHippie77,2,Thu Jul 16 16:54:26 2015 UTC,"I get that Vincent played the role very well, because the role demanded that he be serious but sometimes over-the-top in his dialogue (nobody talks like that, cmon) --- but Vincent is a little awkward overall (see: Jurassic World).

marvelstudios,3dimq8,UNITBlackArchive,17,Thu Jul 16 16:52:17 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call it getting snubbed at all. There is a ton of strong competition this year.
marvelstudios,3dimq8,TriggerHippie77,8,Thu Jul 16 16:55:45 2015 UTC,"True, but it's the same 6 shows or so sweeping all categories.  And they all happen to be the media darling shows.."

Great performances, yes, but 2/6 of the best across all of TV for a year?"
marvelstudios,3dimq8,UNITBlackArchive,5,Thu Jul 16 18:22:37 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of Emilia Clarke. She's beautiful, but I don't think she's a great actress."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,LiverOfOz,5,Thu Jul 16 19:20:33 2015 UTC,I think Season 5 shouldn't have really gotten any acting nominations imo.
marvelstudios,3dimq8,your_mind_aches,8,Thu Jul 16 18:31:34 2015 UTC,"Lena Headey and Peter Dinklage both did phenomenal this season still. Emilia Clarke was a bit lackluster this season though, I was really surprised seeing her nominated."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,JuanRiveara,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:21:20 2015 UTC,Should there be a rule then that a show can't have more than one nomination for each category?
marvelstudios,3dimq8,TriggerHippie77,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:10:28 2015 UTC,Definitely not. If one show has all the best performances it has all the best performances. To limit it would be silly and it wouldn't really be a good gauge of the best performances of the year. Sometimes shows are just better and deserve more nominations.
marvelstudios,3dimq8,hargendarsh,0,Fri Jul 17 01:43:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would be all for it, but it will never happen.   The problem with the Emmys and Oscars is that they are all the industry voting for itself.  It's a vacuum chamber.  They vote on who they want to promote or who they are friends with.   A young star on the rise who has a contract with the studio? Best newcomer award.   That kind of thing.   I think awards shows like the People's Choice Awards are far more telling as to what the populace really thinks as to who the best actor, etc. are.  Unfortunately, they usually leave the vote open to the Internet and let people vote as many times as they like, so the game can be rigged there too.   A good example is Rodney Dangerfield. He literally got no respect.  He was a performing actor since he was a child in single digits and kept busy most of his life.  But the industry didn't like him as a person.  He wanted a Star on the Walk of Fame and I think he rightly deserved it, but no one would nominate him in the industry, despite his long career.  They considered him too crass, so they ignored him.  Love him or hate him, you should at least recognize the career and devotion."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,UNITBlackArchive,2,Thu Jul 16 20:23:06 2015 UTC,"i assumed d'onofrio would get something but after i actually looked at the list, i can understand why he didn't quite make the top 6 supporting actors this time around.  i mean, ehrmantraut, tyrion, and stamper? i'm not familiar with the other roles but i'm willing to trust the academy's judgment if they say they can hang with the three i mentioned, especially michael kelly. he was amazing as stamper this past season."

marvelstudios,3dimq8,technologicalbrian,5,Thu Jul 16 16:22:05 2015 UTC,"It deserves more nominations than that, but this isn't unexpected for a new show.  Most shows take at least a couple seasons to get noticed by the Emmy's, even if they start out with critical acclaim.  Game of Thrones just rocked the nominations, despite having one of its weaker seasons."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,rodmandiplomacy,2,Thu Jul 16 19:12:36 2015 UTC,"this is the other part of the Emmys beyond how cool following a show is, unless you are a comedy nobody has seen most of the nominations are given to the same people over and over again(see: Modern Family), only if you do enough noise for 2 or more seasons they give you a few nominations to please the fans, god forbid winning a prize"
marvelstudios,3dimq8,soulbreaker1418,5,Thu Jul 16 20:26:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like Vincent D'Onofrio really deserved a nod. His portrayal of Kingpin was something I really didn't expect, yet he completely won me over."

marvelstudios,3dimq8,LiverOfOz,3,Thu Jul 16 19:21:56 2015 UTC,...In your head canon? Because I don't think Game of Thrones was even nominated.
marvelstudios,3dimq8,off-hand,8,Thu Jul 16 19:43:08 2015 UTC,Game of Thrones won for it's first year and since it hasn't used a different opening it hasn't been nominated since.
marvelstudios,3dimq8,JuanRiveara,2,Thu Jul 16 20:00:47 2015 UTC,"So I have thought this for a while and have been conflicted about saying it, but I feel like the Daredevil title sequence is too similar to the Hannibal title sequence and sort of unoriginal."
marvelstudios,3dimq8,crawlspace_taste,3,Thu Jul 16 21:01:42 2015 UTC,Why visual effects? There was no green screen or cgi. Also no nominee for best choreography? WTF. Fuck off Emmys
marvelstudios,3dimq8,ReZ-115,3,Thu Jul 16 18:30:52 2015 UTC,Visual effects stands for practical effects that they do on set and not during post production. There were tons of visual effects.

marvelstudios,3diy2x,al57115,7,Fri Jul 17 01:14:19 2015 UTC,I just saw it in a regular theatre...
marvelstudios,3diy2x,elboltonero,6,Fri Jul 17 03:13:23 2015 UTC,...how many posts in this sub in the last two weeks have been from people who saw pre screenings?
marvelstudios,3diy2x,_tylerthedestroyer_,6,Fri Jul 17 02:43:10 2015 UTC,"I was watching it when you typed this post. Yeah, it's out.  Critics also get advanced screenings so they can publish their reviews prior to the release of the movie, driving up buzz and driving more people to the theaters opening weekend."

marvelstudios,3doi1m,offthebsides,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:44:14 2015 UTC,I dont think he will. It would be a little hard to explain where the third brother was during all this Thor Loki turmoil and attacks on Asgard
marvelstudios,3doi1m,Try_Another_Please,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:17:30 2015 UTC,"There is a small chance that they could successfully explain that he's been off on the other planets that make up the 9 Realms as a spy or something (kind of like Barton or Romanov) and wasn't really ""in touch"" with his father because he was on mission or what not. Maybe something like that. Or maybe he was thought dead and he's just been imprisoned. He's likely to not be in it, but we'll just have to see."

marvelstudios,3djvyv,Jala47,6,Thu Jul 16 22:08:51 2015 UTC,That's a nice looking poster. Too bad I'm not seeing it at an AMC. I'll have to ask a friend of mine who is if they'll let him take an extra one.

marvelstudios,3djvyv,Inspace96,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:11:30 2015 UTC,Just pm'd it to you.
marvelstudios,3djvyv,FreakingAwesomeThing,2,Fri Jul 17 12:42:44 2015 UTC,The theater is also pretty empty. No line just yet.
marvelstudios,3djvyv,Inspace96,2,Thu Jul 16 21:29:17 2015 UTC,I'm kind of angry that they didn't have it when I went tonight.  I went to a 7pm showing in IMAX 3D at the AMC in the area and they had zilch.
marvelstudios,3djvyv,doramajoo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:00:51 2015 UTC,Update: Apparently AMC doesn't give a shit about these posters. I saw someone carrying one and walk in to a theater playing AMY.

marvelstudios,3djvyv,MrDriplett,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:11:25 2015 UTC,That sounds nice. Wish every theater had that kind of policy.  Guy in front of me pulled out his phone less than 10 minutes into the movie last night.
marvelstudios,3djvyv,jdinger29,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:30:00 2015 UTC,Back where I used to live no matter what movie we would always end up next to talker.

marvelstudios,3dknej,alexjuuhh,2,Fri Jul 17 07:22:52 2015 UTC,Didn't one of the two direct one of the paintball episodes? Those are amazing.
marvelstudios,3dknej,JuanRiveara,2,Fri Jul 17 14:06:10 2015 UTC,"They directed, might have just been one of them, the two part paintball finale of season 2. Justin Lin who's the director of Fast & Furious 3-6 and the new Star Trek movie directed Modern Warfare."
marvelstudios,3dknej,BZenMojo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:09:20 2015 UTC,That second Thor wasn't actually amazing. You basically put their odds at 50/50 for great movies compared to just alright movies.

marvelstudios,3dknej,SwagBelow,4,Fri Jul 17 04:05:07 2015 UTC,Damn this is very good. This shows that marvel is going to make the new Spider-Man film very comedic. A key element to the character and was missing from the prior films. I have a good feeling about this. A action superhero comedy is exactly what Spider-Man should be so i am excited.

Doc Ock: ""You're getting on my nerves.""  Spider-Man: ""I have a knack for that.""  Doc Ock: ""Not anymore.""    ""Where do these guys come from?""

You could also have a ton of golden age supporting characters like Jimmy Woo and Phineas Horton. On top of that they could use older versions of already introduced characters e.g. Peggy, Howard Stark, Zola and Jarvis, or younger versions of characters like Fury, Alexander Pearce and John Garrett. The Golden Age is a potential goldmine if Marvel are willing to dig into it."

Could also get Union Jack and Spitfire in there too, who'd be pretty cool to see."

marvelstudios,3dlfo0,Totesbannedx2,-3,Fri Jul 17 16:50:06 2015 UTC,"Comics-wise, have you heard of The Ultimates? The first arc was a kind of modern retelling of the assembling of The Avengers, except in the Ultimate universe...  Not exactly what you had in mind. It's set around year 2000 and features Freddie Prinze Jr and George W Bush.    That's... Maybe not the best way to sell it, but it really is pretty good!"
marvelstudios,3dlfo0,beekeeper23,2,Fri Jul 17 06:28:20 2015 UTC,"The Ultimates – and much of Ultimate Marvel in general – was, in part, the basis for a lot of the recent Marvel comic-to-film adaptations we've seen, not just Marvel Studios. Even the Ultimates had some pretty big influence on how the Avengers have been depicted (Chief among them, using SLJ's likeness for Fury).  I think what OP is looking for is a superhero team that would exist in the MCU before the Avengers. The early-00's setting of the book is really just a product of when it was written.  But Ultimate Marvel is fascinating. Check out this story if you guys aren't as familiar with the line and its influence."

The connections between movies are obvious but unless explicitly said, tieing into SHIELD and the Defenders series is a little trickier without blatant shout outs.... and even then, the whole theta protocol thing just felt gratuitous with how little we're given and its timing in the series, and the way it wrapped up a storyline so easily was disappointing."
marvelstudios,3dik38,sorin255,31,Thu Jul 16 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"I liked how Theta Protocol was handled in the show, it helped fill in the confusion of where the fuck the helicarrier came from in Age of Ultron."
marvelstudios,3dik38,Frostguard11,-15,Thu Jul 16 17:34:05 2015 UTC,The whole Theta Protocol thing was pretty poorly conceived. It had a lot of potential but it was just glossed over.

Heck even just a mention of him or a ""close friend"" would have helped.   The whole Coulson remains dead in the movies thing is ridiculous."
marvelstudios,3dik38,wilara23,3,Thu Jul 16 19:58:54 2015 UTC,"It's also kind of weird, since his brother in the AoS showrunner."
marvelstudios,3dik38,TheDalekCaan,2,Fri Jul 17 00:15:53 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Sure having randos show up in the movie was whatever, ok. But it made the show feel like the movie blew a hole through their very strong second season by forcing them to cater to a movie they were not allowed to be connected to by wasting a ton of time on a nothing connection. It didn't even have to be Coulson if Whedon is /that/ dead set on keeping the two separate (which kind of defeats the initial pull of the series in the first place), he could have kept ducked out and had it been a few members of the tv team helping out~"
marvelstudios,3dik38,SandieSandwicheadman,2,Fri Jul 17 00:28:24 2015 UTC,"I'm also kinda bummed that they didn't do more about it in the show. Some whispers, a quick tease, and then suddenly all is right with the two SHIELDs - a story that should've lasted through Civil War."

I feel like Whedon wanted the anti Man of Steel scenario, where the heroes actually care about the innocents being out of harms way. But that's not all that was wrong with MoS. If you're gonna show a lot of destruction, it has to have weight, and even if people were saved, the Avengers still ultimately fucked up by putting Ultron out there in the first place. Sure, it was kick-ass seeing everyone being saved in Sokovia, but a whole fucking city got destroyed and everyone is all happy-go-lucky in the end.   I'm sure Civil War will show more of the impact of those events, but the end of Age of Ultron felt really out-of-place."

marvelstudios,3dkmqo,cuzinit,11,Sat Jul 18 00:15:25 2015 UTC,"My favourite MCU film is Cap:TWS and it's perfect.  No but seriously, the only criticism I have is that it takes a fairly large amount of hand-waving to explain how Zola stored his entire brain on a bunch of cassette tape. They could have had Pierce on the montior, talking to Widow and Cap from the comfort of his office in the Triskelion, explaining Hydra's infiltration of SHIELD and delivering the creepy documentary-footage monologue to them. It would have been more believable, and it would have served to develop Pierce as a villain and make him seem truly menacing (lets be real, it's a fucking creepy scene), and it even would have made sense why he was explaining his evil plan to them: he was stalling while Hydra raced to blow them up. We could have gotten a wonderful Ozymandias moment from him there. No need for computer-tape-brain, no need to bring a character back from the dead just to kill him right away, more villain development. Much neater.  I know that it was Zola's algorithm that was what drove the narrative of the movie, as they discover it, followed it to where it originated and then fought to stop it, but they could have easily tweaked the plot a little to fix that: just explain that the algorithm was developed by a Hydra team working out of the basement of the old army base. They even could have said they based it on Zola's work within Hydra before he died.  Ultimately this doesn't bother me that much, as the execution of Zola's monologue and the impact of discovering Hydra was inside SHIELD was done perfectly. But I think it's the only part of the movie that doesn't quite fit: if you're going to bring a character back from the dead inside a goddamn analogue computer brain, there should be more impact behind that character than a single scene. Either commit to it 100%, or don't do it at all."

marvelstudios,3dkmqo,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,5,Fri Jul 17 07:12:36 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think the decision was made during his ninja fight with. Nobu. Matt shows up with the intent to kill Fisk and because of that he allowed himself to walk right into a trap and almost get himself killed. When he ultimately saw that the desire to kill Fisk hurt him more than any benefit it did he gave up on it and chose to go after him (semi)legally. That's why he switches focus from punching people in the head to working the case with Foggy and Karen. Beating Fisk up at the end only happened as a necessity, not because it's what he wanted to do."

marvelstudios,3dkmqo,Frostguard11,12,Fri Jul 17 04:12:16 2015 UTC,"This has got to be it for me too. There's one tactic the Winter Soldier uses on the helicarrier which is to use two firearms at once, forcing Cap to defend his head with the shield so he can shoot him in the side at the same time. Considering that he has a nearly endless supply of weapons, he had opportunities to do that earlier in the film too. I can see how that would get boring though, and to be fair at times Cap hides his entire body behind the shield."

At close range you are already fcked, at mid range putting the shield at body level actually makes it very hard to aim for the legs. Both gun and shield are about the same height. So the gunner would have to aim very low at a guy running at him. If the angle is a little bit too high, caps running speed makes it so the bullet ends up hitting the shield, if the angle is too low, it would hit the ground right infront of cap instead. Also not sure if you have fired a gun before but it is extremely hard to aim and hit a moving target as fast a cap in a battle field.  http://imageshack.com/a/img901/2035/mvGeuL.png  picture to demonstrate.   in Conclusion, yeah it would have been smarter to hit his legs but its not nearly as easy as you would think."

Obviously, if someone did it would kind of kill the Universe, but you gotta think there's one Hydra guy goin' ""You killed my buddy! You bastard! Eat blue flame, MFer!"""

marvelstudios,3dkmqo,Marvelsquash,4,Fri Jul 17 23:16:16 2015 UTC,"My favorite movie is definitely The Winter Soldier. My only gripe comes in the form of Howard Stark. During the Zola scene they show a newspaper with the death of Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) as the headline. But in Iron Man 2 they have Howard Stark being portrayed by John Slattery. Now, I wouldn't have a problem with this except for the fact that Slattery came back in Ant-Man as a much older Stark, meaning that the Dominic Cooper Stark couldn't have been the one that died. If they would have just written it off as a Norton/Ruffalo situation, I would have been fine with that. But they went and reused him so it makes the Dominic Cooper appearance on the newspaper a glaring hole for me"
marvelstudios,3dkmqo,Zarosian_Emissary,15,Fri Jul 17 05:02:31 2015 UTC,"Different newspapers used different pictures for the obituary/story. One Newspaper showed the older Stark as he was when he died, and the other chose to use an older picture of him from when he was younger."

marvelstudios,3dkmqo,Zaidswith,3,Fri Jul 17 15:14:41 2015 UTC,That's exactly how they're using them. I don't think they originally planned either Howard role as re-occurring. So it's a little bizarre.  Dominic Cooper has the better Stark look.
marvelstudios,3dkmqo,BZenMojo,3,Fri Jul 17 16:57:49 2015 UTC,"Dominic Cooper looks like baby Tony Stark because he's meant to be an ersatz Tony Stark because RDJ is the fan favorite. John Slattery is meant to look like Tony's hardass dad because he's meant to be the dark side of Tony Stark. One was defined as the guy Tony was becoming,  the other is just Tony Stark shoved into the 40s. One is meant to be fun and lighthearted, one is meant to be dark."
marvelstudios,3dkmqo,Zaidswith,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:03:30 2015 UTC,Possibly.   I just think Dominic Cooper could be related to RDJ. John Slattery doesn't look like either of them.

marvelstudios,3djbem,Melanismdotcom,78,Thu Jul 16 18:58:43 2015 UTC,"let's see:   Iron Man 1: Pepper.  Not really a DID, does need to be saved from Stane but also helps to stop him.  Is Tony's assistant but shown to be indispensable to Stark Industries.  Does sort of fall into the stereotype of the organized female secretary.  Incredible Hulk: Betty.  Scientist, daughter of antagonist.  Hulk saves her when she gets in the middle of an attack, but otherwise she is not a DID.  She seems reasonably competent.  Not tons of depth but she has human relationships, like with her father.  I wouldn't say she's particularly powerful.  Iron Man 2: Again, Pepper.  As the new CEO of SI, she does display some real power in this one, even over Tony.  He saves her once from an exploding drone, but she wasn't really aware of it until he swept her away so not exactly a DID  Thor: Jane. She is an intelligent scientist, but she's also pretty ditzy and one dimensional.  Her character traits include ""scientist"" ""sort of awkward"" and ""likes Thor"".  That said, she is never a DID in this movie.  Captain America: TFA.  Peggy.  Powerful, has agency.  While she is ""the love interest"" this is one of Marvel's best romances.  Never has to be rescued, is a competent military person and leader. Not a DID.  The Avengers: Black Widow, and all of the female characters, are powerful and competent.  None of them ever need to be rescued (except minor civilians, which is fine.)  Iron Man 3: Pepper remains powerful, but at one point in this movie she is captured and experimented on and needs to be saved by Tony.  She ends up finishing off Killian, but she does become a DID during the course of this movie.  Thor: TDW: The thrust of the plot is that Jane is in danger and Thor needs to save her.  She is not particularly powerful.  she does help during the final fight with some (very iffy) science.  For large portions of this movie, Jane is a DID.  Captain America: TWS: Black Widow is highly competent, powerful, and never needs to be saved.  She comes off as a real character with her own thoughts and feelings, and is not a love interest.  Not a DID.  Guardians of the Galaxy: Gamora.  Gamora is powerful and has her own motivations.  There are however two scenes where she is saved by the male protagonist.  Not really a DID overall though.  Avengers: AOU: Black Widow is captured by Ultron and needs to be saved by Hulk.  Still, she proves her resourcefulness by sending a signal while captured, and is highly competent and with real character in the rest of the movie.  Scarlet Witch is likewise very powerful, arguably the most powerful in the movie.  Overall, Feige is right that Marvel does not really use the damsel in distress trope.  Some of the Marvel women are decently powerful, and they are very rarely objectified or sexualized.  The biggest problem is that they are largely still secondary characters to male protagonists, even after 12 movies, and we still have 8 movies to go before we get to one with a female lead.  Marvel's television shows are doing much better - out of their three  released tv shows, 1 has a female lead, and another has a pretty evenly split ensemble cast of protagonists, and the show is arguably Skye's.  The women in Daredevil aren't particularly powerful, but it's kind of the point that none of the common people are, and they are decently fleshed out characters in their own right beyond being ""love interests""."

marvelstudios,3djbem,JuanRiveara,6,Thu Jul 16 23:31:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed, at the very least they could have given us her reaction to it, like she decides it's not what she wants to be and asks Tony to fix it rather than she gets powers ---> Tony says ""I fixed Pepper"""
marvelstudios,3djbem,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,5,Thu Jul 16 23:50:37 2015 UTC,"It's all a bit strange, Pepper was such a big part of Tony's life and their/her story ends without any explanation. I hope she has at least a small part in CW, it definitely would have been cool if she had at least a cameo in AoU."
marvelstudios,3djbem,lazybeetroot,-1,Fri Jul 17 05:16:56 2015 UTC,"The powers she got in IM3 would've made her a match for at least half of the avengers, and the extremis wasn't good for people."
marvelstudios,3djbem,yeblod,6,Fri Jul 17 00:49:31 2015 UTC,"sorry, i meant b-level as in, ""not one of the main avengers"", not b-level as in ""not as good"". And I feel like it would have been more believable to make her stable than to make a cure"
marvelstudios,3djbem,MrsRadon,23,Fri Jul 17 00:52:14 2015 UTC,Great analysis. It's true that the women in Marvel usually are usually pretty solid characters and rarely become DIDs. But the DID cliche has already fallen out of fashion for some time now so avoiding it isn't as remarkable as it used to be. I agree that the real issue here is not so much how the women are portrayed and more that they're usually not considered important enough to be the main star in movies.
marvelstudios,3djbem,AlleyOopToym,10,Thu Jul 16 21:16:35 2015 UTC,"I feel like Television has the upper hand on female characters solely because they have free reign to work with B-list or even original characters. It's an unfortunate reality, but nearly all our A-list superheroes are white men. And Marvel had been very conservative in their film strategy.  Here's us hoping that Phase 4 onwards starts using the post-Secret Wars teams. If Phase 3 is a success it should show Marvel shouldn't afraid of minority characters."
marvelstudios,3djbem,ArmandTanzarianMusic,3,Fri Jul 17 01:50:39 2015 UTC,Just to make a point here regarding Iron Man 3. Pepper needing saving at some points in the film does not make her a damsel in distress. In the film she also saves Tony Stark not once but twice so if we were going to be simplistic about it then Iron Man would be classified as a damsel in distress.  Women being in peril or needing saving in a superhero / action film does not automatically make them a damsel in distress no more than if their male counterparts face the same threats (which they often do) it's only when the sole purpose of the character is to be rescued that it becomes an issue.
marvelstudios,3djbem,JohnnyReeko,29,Fri Jul 17 09:20:52 2015 UTC,He probably shouldn't have brought up Natalie Portman. All she does in those movies is drool over Thor's huge muscles.

marvelstudios,3djbem,lazybeetroot,2,Fri Jul 17 05:08:54 2015 UTC,I'd generally agree but there are two flaws.  Peggy Carter goes from zero to violence at the slightest provocation. She's over the top.  The lack of female villains is horrible. I'm so tired of Team Diversity versus Team White Male (and usually British).
marvelstudios,3djbem,crapusername47,3,Fri Jul 17 11:03:10 2015 UTC,"IM: Obadiah Stane, white, not British Hulk: Abomination, white, English. IM2: Ivan Vanko, white, not British Thor: Loki, white, English. CA: Red Skull, red white, not British. Avengers: Loki again. IM3: ""Mandarin"", white, English. Thor:TDW: Malekith, alien but technically white I guess, technically English but I don't remember him talking. Then again the Thor films are my least favorites so that's probably why. CA:TWS: Various, mostly white, mostly not English GOTG: Ronan, blue (technically white), speaks with an English accent AoU: Ultron, robot (technically white), not British Ant-Man: Darren Cross, white, not British (spoilerd because I want to be safe, even though I don't think those count)   If we're talking the TV shows, it's getting a little more diverse. Jiaying from AoS is neither male nor white nor British, and she was an important villain. There were some minor (male) villains in Daredevil who weren't white/British, but the big bad still was.  So it's about half and half on the British spectrum, but you're right. We have mostly only had white male villains so far, and that's lame."
marvelstudios,3djbem,melibelli,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:02:04 2015 UTC,"In terms of the actors who played them:   Stane - White, Male, American. Blonsky - White, Male, British. Vanko - White, Male, American. Hammer - White, Male, American. Loki - White, Male, British. Red Skull - White, Male, Australian. Zola - White, Male, British. The Other - White, Male, American. Killian - White, Male, Australian. Maya Hansen - White, Female, British Mandarian - White, Male, Indian/British Malekith - White, Male, British. Kurse - Black, Male, British. Winter Solider - White, Male, American. Pierce - White, Male, American. Rumlow - White, Male, American. Ronan - White, Male, British. Nebula - White, Female, British. Ultron - White, Male, American. Klaue - White, Male, British. Thanos - White, Male, American.   Every major villain in every MCU film has checked at least two of the boxes. The only genuine female villain the entire movie franchise has seen has been Nebula since Iron Man 3 fell over itself to redeem Maya Hansen. I will give IM3 a bit of credit here as the movie has female random mooks who are dispatched by the Iron Legion with no 'oh no, I killed a woman!' nonsense.  As far as the TV franchise goes, Agent Carter gets credit for Dottie who curbstomps Carter when they actually fight and isn't only a villain because some man made her that way.  Whatever credit Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. might get is wiped out by the whole 'Yes Men' incident."
marvelstudios,3djbem,crapusername47,2,Fri Jul 17 16:35:10 2015 UTC,"It goes with the heroes and supporting cast...almost all white, almost all dudes. It's overwhelming for the villains because there's only room for one villain per film usually"
marvelstudios,3djbem,BZenMojo,2,Fri Jul 17 21:07:46 2015 UTC,"Forgetting about the actual Avengers and Guardians, there's an army of women on the good guy side.  Pepper, Betty Ross, Jane Foster, Frigga, Sif, Darcy, Peggy Carter, Maria Hill, Nova Prime, Agent 13, Hope and so on.  Marvel has never been afraid of having female villains in their comics, what changed with the movies?  Although not an MCU series, even the ones they do have like Mystique have been whitewashed. Poor little Raven is only a villain because big bad Magneto made her that way, instead of being a villain decades before Magneto was even born."
marvelstudios,3djbem,crapusername47,4,Fri Jul 17 21:31:08 2015 UTC,"You know, the reason the MCU, Marvel comics in general, and 'Mad Max: Fury Road' have such fantastic female characters is because they're legitimately ass-kicking, believable, and complex characters.  They're not some byproduct of affirmative action for some feminist agenda.  They're great characters with agency.  I get really tired of hearing how everything is sexist just because most of the most popular superheroes are men.  I'm excited to see more female heroes because diversity is awesome.  'Agent Carter', 'Jessica Jones', 'Captain Marvel', and most of 'Agents of SHIELD' all are female-led, and the supporting women have never truly been damsels.  But when phase one is full of male heroes, it isn't due to sexism.  That said, I would love if the 'Ant-Man' sequel was 'The Wasp' rather than 'Ant-Man 2'!"

It seems like at first they play the damsel-in-distress thing a bit, but they really do flesh out the characters. My personal favorite is Vanessa. She's really believable and powerful as a mob wife and Ayelet Zurer is so good in the role. It's funny that she's Superman's mom in Man of Steel too."

marvelstudios,3de9si,DownbeatWings,15,Wed Jul 15 22:18:29 2015 UTC,"The way he types  on his posts suggests that it's him. Look at james gunn. He's in the middle of writing GOTG2 and still has time to manage his own facebook and go on snapchat 24/7. Social media isn't hard. RDJ's job is chill. He just films marvel and chill's on his million's of dollars. most people who work 9-5 every day work harder and are always on facebook and twitter. so its not that far fetched to assume he does manage them.   When celebrity pages are run by people other then them, its very easy to tell and they are usually very bland."
marvelstudios,3de9si,coool12121212,16,Wed Jul 15 22:42:29 2015 UTC,"He just films marvel and chill's on his million's of dollars   He's also contractually obliged to promote the films he's in which includes travelling internationally, attending panels/conventions/premieres/ceremonies, and doing talk shows/interviews. I'm sure he also donates a significant amount of his time to non-profits or other self-promoting and philanthropy events.     Not to mention he probably has a personal life that is whatever a normal person has times ten. Like you said he ""chill's"", but that can consist of some very well-deserved and time consuming activities.

You think he can't do it JUST before an interview? Of course he can! its posting to facebook. Not rocket science that has a 10-step process with chinese instructions.  Posting to facebook is not nearly as hard or time consuming as your making it to be. Do you even own a smart phone of any kind? This is 2015. Not 1990.   Posting on Facebook and other social media outlets would be work for him   You really think posting on facebook resembles any form of hard work? I mean seriously. He isn't the president.  EDIT: Look at this   The fact that the whole cast have time to go out and party While shooting the movie compeltely destroys anything you've said. The guy goes clubbing DURING filming?

When you get a villain that good you have to milk them for all he's worth. I think he had the potential to be awesome. I think Winter Soldier also needs more credit. He was a terrifying and badass villain. I know he's not a villain in the true sense of the word, but he made the tension in Cap 3 go through the roof whenever he was on screen. He almost stole the movie."
marvelstudios,3dgun3,Dr_Disaster,3,Thu Jul 16 13:36:27 2015 UTC,Maybe we could see a film or TV episode showing Howard Stark and Obadiah Stane and it reveals that the reason Stark died in the car crash is because Stane knew Hydra through his Ten Rings connection?

Personally I loved killian. He was the first guy since stane that actually made tony look powerless.

marvelstudios,3dj88f,JuanRiveara,3,Thu Jul 16 22:46:54 2015 UTC,"Well one it's done in the comic books, but a better reason is it's a way to have sequels without having everything be the boring numerical identifier approach. Iron Man is numbered but it can be argued that it's like his suits. Everything else is either a colon and a subtitle or is like GotG and at least uses Volume along with the number. And since Spidey is THE most popular character Marvel has it wouldn't be confusing to the general audience near as much as if it were done for any other character. Plus, I'm betting that Spidey is gonna be their most ""kid-friendly"" hero overall and naming it like that just adds to a little kid's ""cool factor""."
marvelstudios,3dj88f,UmbrusNightshade,3,Thu Jul 16 22:51:14 2015 UTC,"I like the numerical approach. It's simple and to the point, this is a sequel to this.

marvelstudios,3dj88f,GnarlsD,2,Thu Jul 16 19:15:30 2015 UTC,"Spider-Man: The New Avenger  Or ""Spider-Man:_________"" A second title would really good to distinguish it from both sets of Spider-Man movies already been done, like Spider-Man 1, 2, and 3, which used numbers, and then using ""Spectacular Spider-Man"" or ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" would be too much like ""the Amazing Spider-Man"" and I can already hear folks saying ""Spectacular Spider-Man? Ughh not another reboot... Come on Sony...""   So using a second title similar to Captain America: The First Avenger, would be a good move, since it would make it different than the previous movies in a subtle way, and also instantly bring association the MCU if they actually have the word Avenger in the title.   Calling the movie Spider-Man: The New Avenger would really do them a lot of favours, especially when people in general are weary of reboots, assure them it's going to be good."

They will generally have these figures available for pre-order within a few days of the official announcement by Hot Toys.  I would not recommend using eBay, as unlike these reputable companies, customer service can be spotty at best, and they are more susceptible to price hikes and scalpers.

marvelstudios,3dh01u,UmbrusNightshade,17,Thu Jul 16 05:28:12 2015 UTC,"I agree. One thing that stands out to me (and I think it's the correct approach to have) is that they want to let the TV side shows speak for themselves before they start trying to put in X character from another show or a film.

marvelstudios,3dh01u,murdockmanila,7,Thu Jul 16 05:42:17 2015 UTC,"That is smart. It is always thrilling to hear the mentions and see the cameos but, in the end, the show needs to be able to stand on its own to be any good. I am glad they think like that."

My idea is that Luke Cage is a generally good guy, even a hero, but he first and foremost cares about himself. He mostly only helps for money. The origin episodes have him in prison. When he gets out, he'll roam around crime-ridden inner city New York/Hell's Kitchen trying to earn a living stopping crime. As the series progresses, he will eventually grow into a hero in his own way. Still wanting money incentive and things, but he will also help those in need."

Following our conversations with Corey Stoll (who plays the film’s villain, Darren Cross), Peyton Reed (who directed the film) and David Dastmalchian and Michael Peña (who play Kurt and Luis), we’ve got a very special interview with Ant-Man himself, Paul Rudd! Not only does Paul Rudd discuss the work that went into making Ant-Man as both an actor and a writer, he discusses his experiences suiting up with the Avengers in the upcoming Captain America: Civil War! Check it out in the player below.  In addition to Rudd, Ant-Man stars Evangeline Lilly (“LOST,” The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies) and Michael Douglas (The Game, And So It Goes) and brings a founding member of The Avengers to the big screen for the first time. Armed with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, master thief Scott Lang (Rudd) must embrace his inner-hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym (Douglas), protect the secret behind his spectacular Ant-Man suit from a new generation of towering threats. Against seemingly insurmountable obstacles, Pym and Lang must plan and pull off a heist that will save the world.  The Ant-Man cast also features Bobby Cannavale, Tip “T.I.” Harris, Wood Harris and Judy Greer. Check back tomorrow for our final interview with Evangeline Lilly!"

marvelstudios,3djr0e,XDReyes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:30:57 2015 UTC,Didn't Disney take over after this movie came out though?
marvelstudios,3djr0e,lazybeetroot,2,Fri Jul 17 00:19:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, but Marvel were always PG13 movies, in an interview Favreau said that he and RDJ had a lot of ideas for IM2 that Marvel was not OK with, but I think when Disney bought Marvel, (right before IM3) these movies became even more kid and family friendly. Hence the addition of a kid for Tony to hang out with and as a major plot point in IM3. The tone of IM2 was a very different one compared to IM3. IM2 had a lot more adult like jokes that kids not necessary understood."
marvelstudios,3djr0e,XDReyes,2,Fri Jul 17 01:34:13 2015 UTC,"""Agent Romanoff, you and Banner better not be playing 'hiding the zucchini'"" Stuffs like this is still in the movies. GotG is a great example of how Disney really doesn't have that much influence over the tone. Am I not understanding this right, maybe?"

marvelstudios,3djr0e,alarmsoundslikewhoop,0,Thu Jul 16 22:56:43 2015 UTC,"I have a real problem with Tony's dad hiding his design for a new element in a theme park layout. There is not one part of this that makes sense to me.   1) Is that how elements work? Can you just have an idea for a new configuration of protons and neutrons and predict what properties the element will have?  2) Why hide it in a theme park? There are so many better ways to hide this information, if hiding it is for some reason what you want to do.   3) Would Howard Stark be that intimately involved in the architectural layout of the Stark Expo? I know Disney was heavily involved in the design of the Disney parks, and that's sort of what they're trying to evoke, but Howard Stark is an engineer not an artist.   4) The main plot of the movie is that Tony is dying, and wouldn't the solution be more meaningful if it came from him and not from his extremely convoluted discovery of something his father already designed? If this is supposed to be about the relationship between Tony and Howard, then the information should have been communicated in a way more meaningful to their relationship.  5) How does Nick Fury know about the element and why not just tell Tony ""Hey, there's an element your father designed but couldn't create. You should search through his stuff for clues because we never figured out how he hid the information"" instead of ""Well, I'm here to tell you that you haven't tried everything wink"" and fingers crossed Tony figures out what Fury's alluding to before he dies.   Also, I don't find the final fight to be very exciting. I know some disagree, but robots shooting guns at robots doesn't do it for me."

Banner took Tony up on his offer and was nerding it up at Avengers Tower.   Even Maria Hill commented that she wasn't sure how to get the group together again since they're all going their separate ways.

marvelstudios,3de3fi,sandiskplayer34,3,Wed Jul 15 16:40:21 2015 UTC,"Very weird factoid: Universal Studios holds exclusive rights to Marvel theme parks East of the Mississippi due to a deal made long before Disney bought Marvel (they used to have it almost world-wide, IIRC, but there was some sort of loophole or contract lapse, and as a result you see Marvel attractions being announced for Asia and there being promotional events being held at Disneyland).   As a result, virtually nothing Marvel-related is actually allowed in a Disney Park. And when I say virtually nothing, I mean virtually nothing (they do sell stuff like Mickey Mouse-cosplaying-as-Iron-Man dolls, but I think that might be more because it's more of a Mickey Mouse toy than a Marvel toy). I was last at Disney World shortly after Agents of SHIELD was launched, and there is one section of Hollywood Studios that is basically meant to be the ABC zone. Place was plastered with advertisements for basically every single ABC show... except SHIELD. And it's not like this was after the hype had faded, it was still fairly early in the first season, IIRC. At the end of the Great Movie Ride they have scenes from basically every possible genre you can imagine, including some from Disney's direct competitors, but you don't see any Marvel Movies- not even ones from before the MCU (Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man, for example). There was even a temporary exhibit from the American Film Institute there that had Michael Keaton's Bat-Suit and Christopher Reeve's Superman cape, but there wasn't anything from Marvel in the exhibit.   So now here's where it gets weird. You are probably wondering why there's this bus wrap. Well, you see, the bus is technically not part of a park. It's just something to get people from hotel to park etc. So it doesn't count. Interestingly, Disney/Marvel did something similar with a monorail in the past, but they had to make sure the Monorail wouldn't actually go on a track that actually went through EPCOT.   ...And you thought the Maximoff Twins were complicated."
marvelstudios,3de3fi,ContinuumGuy,3,Wed Jul 15 22:07:12 2015 UTC,"They can put the characters in the parks, just very rarely. Star-Lord and Gamora were at the Villains Party this past October.

marvelstudios,3dexom,JermareSSB,3,Thu Jul 16 02:52:13 2015 UTC,"I kinda feel that's mostly intentional, with internet culture and modern access it kinda puts pressure on people to keep up with TV and see movies as soon as they come out in cinemas so you can discuss this stuff in the now because that's when the majority will see it.  Plus in turn it keeps their ratings in official places where it can be monitored while still relevant and of course generates more income. It just pisses everyone else off who can't or doesn't want to watch everything the instant it's available but we're the minority so spoilers for us or stay off the internet."
marvelstudios,3dexom,xbdxdbx,2,Wed Jul 15 21:04:06 2015 UTC,Marvel doesn't consider it a secret. The guest appearance is also being mentioned in interviews by Feige.

That's one I was disappointed in finding out early. The other is finding out who's in the post-credits scene due to someone posting the leaked version on Tumblr without tagging it for spoilers or anything.

marvelstudios,3dfpik,the1egend1ives,22,Wed Jul 15 22:25:28 2015 UTC,"There are time limits on the contracts.  For example, Fox contracted Daredevil and made the 2003 movie and the Elektra spin off.  They had a deadline for keeping the contract alive by producing another film by 2012/2013.  A reboot was planned but they decided against it.  And the rights just kinda float back through what I'm sure is a massive amount of billable hours for the lawyers back to Marvel.  Ghost Rider was more of a ""we don't want to keep paying on this contract, here...take it back"".

marvelstudios,3dfpik,Jackal_6,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:29:23 2015 UTC,"Most of the time studios acquire film rights they haven't actually purchased the rights, they've acquired what is called a rights option. A rights option is significantly cheaper than purchasing the rights, which is why most studios go for it, but it comes with the stipulation that the studio only has a certain amount of time to get the film in production. If the studio doesn't get a movie into production in that time then the rights revert to the original owner. If they do then the timer resets and they have the option of making another film during that time or letting the rights go back to the original owner.  With the exception of Hulk and Namor, which is a whole story in and of itself, all of the film rights to Marvel characters have been optioned rather than sold. If the studio wants to hold on to those rights they need to keep making movies, which is why Sony rebooted Spider-Man and Fox has already begun production on a Fantastic Four sequel.  It has nothing to do with how well the movie performs, and everything to do with how proactive the studio is in regards to producing new films."

marvelstudios,3dgxrz,blackfire561,12,Thu Jul 16 04:39:16 2015 UTC,KRAVEN  MYSTERIO  CHAMELEON
marvelstudios,3dgxrz,ChipSkylarkDoesntFap,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:06:23 2015 UTC,Kravin's last hunt would be a good story with minor changes. Chameleon would be interesting as well. That would be a very different Spider-Man movie. It wouldn't be about a larger then life villain. It would be smaller in terms of the stakes.
marvelstudios,3dgxrz,UmbrusNightshade,7,Thu Jul 16 05:12:35 2015 UTC,"Someone recently sold me on Chameleon and Mysterio as the first two villains. I was completely against Chameleon before, but the idea presented to me actually works really well:  Basically, (depending on what Civil War establishes for the character) we are getting a Spidey who is maybe a year or less into being a ""hero"". I'm thinking (personally) less than 7 months. Anyway, it's enough time for Spidey to become a bit of an urban legend (like Daredevil in the show) to the local and street level thugs/criminals. So ... Chameleon (who I think should be tied to Hydra; ex-Hydra I'm thinking. This would explain why he has a similar tech to the mask BW uses in WS and Agent 33 uses in AoS) and Mysterio start robbing banks. They utilize their individual ""skills"" to set Spidey up for the robberies. The film is about Spidey trying to clear his name and catch these street level guys.   I know the ""Superhero is Framed"" thing has been used a lot before, but for this version of Spidey I think it works really well. We get Mysterio and his ""trippy powers"". We get Chameleon (who I think would work the best as the villain to get killed) who could tie-in to the rest of the MCU by having him and his tech similar and/or the same as the WS and AoS Hydra mask tech. It would also be another way to tie-in the film side and the movie side of things. Also, if they go with Chameleon as the brother of Kraven the Hunter (and Chameleon gets killed during the film, likely as an accident) then that would lend itself to the eventual introduction of Kraven and set up the foundation for why he would go ""on the hunt"" for Spidey."
marvelstudios,3dgxrz,UmbrusNightshade,3,Thu Jul 16 05:52:02 2015 UTC,IDK about the Kraven brother part but the rest sounds amazing. You have convinced me as well.
marvelstudios,3dgxrz,Emyd,5,Thu Jul 16 05:53:45 2015 UTC,"Well I could be mistaken, but I believe that I read somewhere that Kraven and Chameleon are brothers in the comic books."
marvelstudios,3dgxrz,UmbrusNightshade,2,Thu Jul 16 05:55:04 2015 UTC,I don't like the bit about Hydra. I feel like the movies use SHIELD and Hydra as lazy ways to explain character origins.
marvelstudios,3dgxrz,ChipSkylarkDoesntFap,3,Thu Jul 16 07:51:45 2015 UTC,"I actually feel that Hydra or SHIELD use isn't lazy at all. It gives the films a more realistic approach. Think about it Hydra is like terrorist organizations and criminal enterprises rolled into one. And it's also like a cult. So it makes sense that it keeps creeping back up. SHIELD is like the FBI, NSA, CIA, and other such organizations rolled into one. Since there remains at almost all times the potential threat of Hydra, then there needs to be SHIELD around to deal with that threat. Now I don't want these two groups to be the sole major organizations that the MCU utilizes but their place in the world of the films/shows actually makes a lot of sense."
marvelstudios,3dgxrz,JuanRiveara,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:30:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Chameleon would be a really personal villain. There's so many different opportunities there. He could change to look like Gwen, Uncle Ben, Aunt May. He's disguised himself as basically everyone/anyone close to Peter in the comics, so there's tons of ways to get some real dramatic scenes.   And yeah Kraven is my favorite Spider-Man villain. I want him to be on screen, but he needs to be absolutely perfect. Otherwise I would rather they don't do him for fear of tainting his wonderful name."
marvelstudios,3dgxrz,BoqRottom,8,Thu Jul 16 05:28:34 2015 UTC,Mysterio is a great first villain for him. He can show off some cool visual and is just strong enough for street level Spider-Man without being a complete joke.

marvelstudios,3dgxrz,TheGuyThatDoesThing,4,Fri Jul 17 19:32:00 2015 UTC,"I think, ideally, Vulture would be the way to start out, if they need something to transition Spidey into Avenger territory.   (SPOILERS) I like the idea of Falcon being used recurrently to recruit smaller heroes into Avengers, such as Ant-Man. Imagine Toomes stealing an older model of Falcon's wing tech and using it to commit crimes and terrorize NY. After Civil War, Spidey is already on Falcon's radar, so observing Spidey take on this low level threat and retrieve the tech and be brought back to Avengers HQ at the end and asked to join the team...it all seems likely."
marvelstudios,3dgxrz,FPSGamer48,3,Thu Jul 16 04:54:48 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what i was thinking myself, it ties itself into the MCU narrative perfectly.  The only way it could be better is if Kraven was a Hydra-in Shield that stole the tech."
marvelstudios,3dgxrz,pdthorn,2,Thu Jul 16 05:48:45 2015 UTC,"Also, Chameleon is Kraven's half brother. If Kraven is snatching up SHIELD tech, a certain mask Nat used to impersonate Jenny Agutter's character could definitely wind up in a certain half-brother's hands..."

marvelstudios,3dgxrz,NotSpiderman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:33:28 2015 UTC,"This is a major stretch I feel and predicated on Strange's third act taking place in public for the world to see rather than on another plane of existence (which given the supernatural horror angle of it seems more likely)  I would be a brilliant move subverting the Avengers et al inspiring people like Murdock and Jones to be heroes, having their public figure inspire Mysterio to make capital C-Crime but I find it implausible.  Edit: this is to say nothing of tying the Horror movie across into what will likely be a family friendly affair. I recall Marvel Studios doing small things like this but it requires a lot of handwaving and exposition.  It would be better just having Mysterio as a theatrical villain IMHO."
marvelstudios,3dgxrz,stormz96,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:42:23 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm aware it won't happen, it's basically a guarantee that Strange will not be going public and such."
marvelstudios,3dgxrz,DaGrazzles,5,Fri Jul 17 20:05:34 2015 UTC,"Well based on Feige's comments about the first standalone film having a John Hughes feel, I can't imagine they'd do any of the more sinister villains like Venom, Carnage, or even Kraven right off the bat. My guess is either Mysterio, Shocker, or Scorpion. I'm hoping Mysterio because I think he could be a lot of fun. A different kind of villain to match this different kind of Spidey film."

I also want to see a montage of Spider-Man taking out lots of smaller villains like the Shocker. All the villains that definitely wouldn't be the main baddie.

marvelstudios,3desz3,UmbrusNightshade,4,Wed Jul 15 20:01:32 2015 UTC,Hopefully as little as possible.
marvelstudios,3desz3,ASByrne,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:22:41 2015 UTC,True but i doubt it was a cameo and the screen test had scenes with Tony so it makes sense to give him a larger role in the story .
marvelstudios,3desz3,SirHoneyDip,5,Wed Jul 15 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"They wrote exclusive dialogue with Downey and Evans, and the story's gonna be about Bucky, what does Bucky have to do with Peter?"
marvelstudios,3desz3,youmonsterikill,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:16:43 2015 UTC,Depends on what you define as a cameo. 5 seconds in Entourage like Liam Neeson cameo? Or >2 minutes of screen time? I'm betting he'll have 2 minutes or less of screen time.
marvelstudios,3desz3,BiggChicken,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:17:37 2015 UTC,He's a cameo. His role WILL NOT be anything but small at best.

marvelstudios,3desz3,--Petrichor--,10,Thu Jul 16 12:34:34 2015 UTC,"Putting them into tiers of screen time, my guess would be:   Cap Tony T'Challa, Bucky, Falcon, Zemo Widow and Hawkeye Everyone else who has been mentioned (SW, Vision, Crossbones, Ant-Man, etc.) Spider-Man"
marvelstudios,3desz3,MightyQuinnATL,8,Wed Jul 15 20:22:38 2015 UTC,I'd put Falcon and Bucky right next to Cap honestly.
marvelstudios,3desz3,SwagBelow,10,Wed Jul 15 20:25:17 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what this obsession with screen time is. Not to criticize you specifically, but I've noticed a lot of concern about the number of heroes in the film and the amount of time those heroes get. If it's well written additional characters will only add to the number of interactions and weave a more compelling story. I'd rather have 15 great character defining minutes then half an hour of drawn out tension. The story they want to tell necessitates lots of heroes and varied perspectives. They've turned in a slew of great collaboration films thus far and we should have faith that they will continue this trend."
marvelstudios,3desz3,JuanRiveara,4,Wed Jul 15 20:28:49 2015 UTC,Nick Fury has been in 8 movies and a few episodes of AoS and has about 45 minutes of screen time.  It doesn't take a lot to make an impact.
marvelstudios,3desz3,crackinthewall,3,Thu Jul 16 10:03:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, that was a problem with age of ultron. I'm sure Marvel wont do this again as civil war is going to be huge."
marvelstudios,3desz3,PrimordialDragon,5,Wed Jul 15 21:03:52 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that the New Avengers will get a decent amount of screen time as a unit, though not necessarily with a whole lot of individual development.    And we all know Spider-Man's just a cameo.   While this is most likely the case, we don't, technically speaking, know this. It's just conjecture at this point."
marvelstudios,3desz3,SwagBelow,6,Wed Jul 15 19:02:57 2015 UTC,Personally I wouldn't mind Spider-Man's cameo be strictly a post credit scene.
marvelstudios,3desz3,PrimordialDragon,0,Wed Jul 15 19:12:23 2015 UTC,People keep on saying Spider-man will be a cameo but I doubt it. It would make more sense to give him a  supporting role. I mean marvel would not have done the deal for just a cameo.
marvelstudios,3desz3,SwagBelow,3,Wed Jul 15 19:19:56 2015 UTC,"I doubt he'll have more than 8 minutes in the film. Though those could be important 8 minutes. I'm expecting something similar to Quicksilver in DoFP where they setup his personality, give him a cool action scene, give a reason he's not in the film, and go more in depth in the future."
marvelstudios,3desz3,PrimordialDragon,2,Wed Jul 15 20:12:30 2015 UTC,"I mean marvel would not have done the deal for just a cameo.   Yes, they didn't do the deal for just a cameo. They made a deal with Sony so they could define Spider-Man as a character in the MCU. There's a whole lot of potential with just having Spider-man and his rogue gallery accessible to the bigger Marvel Cinematic Universe. Norman Osborn, H.A.M.M.E.R., Daily Bugle, Kingpin (this should have been obvious), etc. would all be a welcome addition to the MCU. It doesn't necessarily mean that they shouldn't use Spider-man for just a cameo in his first MCU outing when he's got his own film series lined up. This isn't the same comics event. Spider-man doesn't need to have a substantial role in this film other than saying ""yep, he's ours now"" because he's just starting out as a superhero and they wouldn't be able to do him justice in an ensemble for his first outing. He's way out of his depth judging by what we know about him as a character (HS kid, just starting out, kinda new to the super hero stuff, etc.)"

marvelstudios,3desz3,SwagBelow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:35:25 2015 UTC,They made the deal so that Spider-Man will be part of the MCU which is being done.So yes it can be a cameo or a very minor role in Civil War.
marvelstudios,3desz3,p-longstocking,0,Wed Jul 15 19:22:22 2015 UTC,True but I think it had more to get him in civil war specially. They could have done the deal in phase 4 but pick this phase to do so. Spider-man in my opinion will have a larger role then we think. A important supporting protagonist and comic relief. I think he won't have a lot of screen time but it won't be a cameo.
marvelstudios,3desz3,Mike5482,2,Wed Jul 15 19:29:39 2015 UTC,Phase 3 has more than Civil War you know.There's also Infinity Wars.Also if they did it in Phase 4 that would mean that we would only get Spider-Man in the MCU only in 2020+.Also that would mean ASM series would have continued and maybe Sony would have succeeded in making it better thus deciding not to do a deal.  If he was such an important supporting protagonist than they wouldn't have waited so long to cast him.Heck they were almost half way done filming the movie by then.
marvelstudios,3desz3,UmbrusNightshade,0,Wed Jul 15 19:37:32 2015 UTC,I think they waited because they wanted to sure about the casting but we already know he will be having scenes with Tony because of the screen test that were taken so that tells us he has a active role in story.
marvelstudios,3desz3,SmokeyTheBear420,3,Wed Jul 15 20:08:45 2015 UTC,Or maybe his cameo has soemthing to do with Stark.And also I'm pretty sure Stark and Peter are gonna meet in other movies after Civil War so they could have been testing for that.  So no it does not tell us that he has an active role in the story .All that tells us is that they wanted to see if he would be able to fit with Downey.
marvelstudios,3desz3,marcohtx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:20:29 2015 UTC,Fit with Downey in a movie about a civil War where he will maybe have to choose a side. I am just saying the dialogue could make sense to fit a couple  of scenes in the film. We should not just say it will be a cameo. It could easily be a couple of scenes.

Now imagine that times like a hundred.  SHIELD would have so many files (data on every country, info on known spies from all over the world) that even with them open to the public, if the section Gonzales needed wasn't archived in an easily searchable manner yet, he'd still have to parse through a bunch of files himself (e.g. clicking on random links and pressing ctrl+f).

marvelstudios,3db01o,Travis_Touchdown,10,Wed Jul 15 03:41:19 2015 UTC,"Another potential problem with casting an Asian actor has to do with what kind of Asian you cast as there seems to be a lot of sensitivity towards casting Asian actors outside of their particular ethnicity.  For instance, it's taboo in Hollywood to cast a Korean actor as Chinese, a Japanese actor as Vietnamese, an Indonesian actor as Thai, etc (as a side-note this is the reason why Lucy Liu's character, O-Ren Ishii, from Kill Bill was changed from being strictly Japanese to Chinese-Japanese).    As such, in order to cast an Asian as The Ancient One, it would be assumed that the studio would want to cast a Tibetan actor... which causes a whole other problem as it might anger the Chinese government which might cause the movie to be severely edited or worse not shown at all in the country."
marvelstudios,3db01o,ojajaja,35,Wed Jul 15 06:07:29 2015 UTC,"there seems to be a lot of sensitivity towards casting Asian actors outside of their particular ethnicity   Are you serious? Asian actors are still being cast against their actual ethnicity just about everywhere. Just some examples: Randall Park on Fresh off the boat, Ken Jeong as Leslie Chow, Zhang Zi Yi, Michelle Yeoh and Gong Li in Memoirs of a Geisha. Heck, even in 2012 the Tibetan monk and his brother are played by a Canadian-Chinese and a Singaporean respectively.

marvelstudios,3db01o,greenroom628,4,Wed Jul 15 06:22:52 2015 UTC,"daniel rand was supposed to be an outsider to k'un lun.  not necessarily the martial arts culture.  remember, wendell rand (daniel's father) was supposed to have found k'un lun when wendell was still young.  wendell trained in k'un lun and left to become a businessman.  wendell taught his son, daniel, the basics of martial arts before trying to bring his family back to k'un lun where wendell and his wife died trying to save daniel.  *edit: wikipedia page for reference https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)#Fictional_character_biography).  there's nothing in daniel rand's story that can't make him asian.  if anything, it makes it more believable that a mysterious disappearing asian city would take in an orphan who was born to someone who lived in k'un lun."

marvelstudios,3db01o,ElMatasiete7,5,Wed Jul 15 12:02:43 2015 UTC,"So the consensus around that is DiOnfrio's character isn't even technically the Kingpin yet, that should happen in S2 or the Defenders series.

How in the hell is the Ancient One in his current state racist in any way? His character has never been racist and never will be. An Asian is old and wise. Oooh...so racist. People get offended about anything. I really would have preferred they not change the character because some diversity would be nice. I mean, I'm sure it will be fine with Tilda but it is just ridiculous that everyone is saying this is progressive and more politically correct when it is actually the opposite. I heard the same thing with Iron Man 3. MAYBE the Mandarin was SLIGHTLY racist way back in the 60s but having an actual comics Mandarin would not be inherently racist. Notice also that Kingsley is more or less white as well. Iron Man 3 turned out to be great in spite of the change (unpopular opinion?) but I don't like the idea behind it. It's not even politically correct it's just wrong."

Yeah, it's great it's not a white guy, but it's still whitewashing what was an Asian role. Why not an Asian woman?

marvelstudios,3db01o,Supertrinko,6,Wed Jul 15 02:24:53 2015 UTC,"Shang-chi?  Many of the characters in Iron-Fist are also asian. Pretty much all the habitants of K'un-Lun.  You also forget there is a pretty big, but obscure, japanese lineup of heroes in Marvel comics. Big Hero 6 scratches the surface of this, and X-men too. Sadly, that is not MCU territory and the animated BH6 will probably not affect the live action movies, but it doesn't mean asian characters don't exist.  I really don't understand the complaint though, it goes deeper than ""minority representation"" in these movies. For decades comics were written in North America and the only non-white prominent roles were either stereotypical bad guys or some kind of mystical foreign entities. The problem lies there in the old timey comic industry, these movies are just adapting continuities that have been established for a really long time.  If people want to see more minorities in comic book movies, push for minorities in comics, support those comics, and wait for the movie adaptations eventually. It's a slow process, but it's how the industry works."
marvelstudios,3db01o,Beaner8127,-3,Tue Jul 14 23:38:33 2015 UTC,"Shang-chi?   Netflix is nice, but it'd be better if it was actually on the big screen.  Are there that many though? I don't read every comic that Marvel puts out, but I like to think I read a good amount of them.  What is the likelihood of them even showing up? In the next ten years even?   It's a slow process, but it's how the industry works.   Well, that just sort of sucks...I get it, but it still sucks."

It's nice to think that the best actor always gets the part, but it's pretty naive. The director probably had to bargain away her race with the studio execs and their marketing team in order to get MBJ."

Leading up to Iron Man 3 they chose not to do the Mandarin from the comics because it was ""racist and followed stereotypes"". They wanted to diversify by making the Ancient One a woman and they wanted to stay away from Asain stereotypes in fear of being offensive so yes, Swinton would be best for the job in that case.   Swinton would have been perfect for Lady Death and now she's shoved into this. My favorite thing about the MCU was it used to be a great representation of their comic book characters, but after Ultron, Madndarin, and now this casting I'm seeing it going into the Fox-Men territory."

marvelstudios,3dcod5,ArabianAftershock,23,Wed Jul 15 06:27:43 2015 UTC,"That's very true. The trailers set up Ultron as a menacing, threatening villain with high stakes at play, none of which made it into the film. Pretty similar to the whole Mandarin mess with Iron Man 3. Wish more, like Guardians and Ant-Man did, actually showed just what the film is actually like, instead of making it out to be something it's not."
marvelstudios,3dcod5,charlie2094,2,Wed Jul 15 07:11:01 2015 UTC,I found Ultron to be very menacing. I think it has to do with the editing of the final cut. The original cut Joss made was 3 hrs. Disney made him cut a lot of Ultron and the twins scenes so it made the rhythm kinda funky
marvelstudios,3dcod5,DOUGHBOY2662,5,Wed Jul 15 08:50:46 2015 UTC,"I could see that, do think being longer could've helped. Maybe menacing was the wrong word, I just never felt any threat from him, never felt like they were in danger due to how he talked, and how the others seemed pretty relaxed about him, like a lack of urgency. For me, I think Winter Soldier is the only villain that's really carried a real presence with him. Even though we knew he wouldn't kill Cap, he felt dangerous and you could feel every hit he made...part of why I'm so glad the Russo's are doing Infinity War instead."

marvelstudios,3dcod5,HoennBorn,70,Wed Jul 15 17:57:12 2015 UTC,"For me, while there are better moments in AoU, i thought Avengers 1 was alot more balanced in its approach.  While the plot of both films are hardly original or outstanding, i feel Avengers 1 structured its story better in that it was well paced, i didn't feel anything was too fast, too slow, or unjustified. It all flowed as a cohesive narrative to me.   While Avengers 2 had better character moments (Hello Farm House), i feel Avengers 1 had them spread out alot more evenly and really helped to puncutate the action and story, while telling us things about the characters at the moments we needed to know them. Alot of great dialogue runs throughout the film so much so that its used to help it breathe alot better.  Avengers 2 may have had funnier scenes, but i felt Avengers 1 knew how to use their humour to make sense in context, and in some cases even having the jokes built up from previous scenes to make it much more funny instead of just one shot gags (For example, Hulk having a grudge with Thor leading to the punch)  Even the final battle in Avengers 1 was directed and paced alot better even though Avengers 2 had the bigger threat and stakes. I never got bored during the New York fight as (to me), there was something new in every shot. New ways the team were interacting with eachother, new ways the Aliens were being killed, different strategies being employed in taking them down. In Ultron, i remember i lost interest as soon as Ultron's army charged them after Thors: ""Is that all you've got"" scene. It just became a wall of noise to me with the same visuals being used that we had already seen.   Tl;dr. I can keep going, but while i agree Avengers 2 had the better ingredients (Action, story, hummour character moments), i feel Avengers 1 cooked their cake alot better (Pacing, Balancing all of the characters with its story and action)"

The scene you mentioned is one of my favorites in the movie because it helps show how well the Avengers work as a team. This movie shows us the Avengers in their prime, and when Infinity War comes around and Thanos curbstomps the Avengers, you'll look back on this movie and it'll amplify the threat of Thanos. Also, I don't really understand how you could be bored by the final fight because it was similar to the Battle of New York, with new and different takedowns for the Ultron bots. Although, I would have loved a ""one vs. all"" shot of the Avengers fighting Ultron Prime."

I had to see AoU twice before I started to really get what it was doing. The pacing is so fast and go-go-go that after a first viewing I was entertained, sure, but also a bit bewildered.   But I think a lot of the reason AoU isn't catching on with people is that it has so much going on under the surface and comparatively little going on above the surface. So you really have to see it twice (or more?) and talk about it with other people and read articles about it and let it sort of percolate in your mind to unlock a lot of the really brilliant stuff about it.   People can say AoU is a lot of noise and spectacle and a product of the Marvel machine, but Joss Whedon said it's one of the most personal things he's ever put on screen, and while I'm not a Whedon-fanatic I think he's a pretty bright guy, and I think that's an indicator that maybe the movie is worthy of a closer examination than most have given it."

marvelstudios,3dcod5,1stTimeRedditter,2,Wed Jul 15 13:26:57 2015 UTC,"It's a stretch to say ""hate on it,"" but as the crown jewel of the studio, There are plenty of reasons to be disappointed:  The biggest and laziest fault of the film the third act deus ex machina. 1) These capabilities and actions weren't remotely foreshadowed, 2) it makes our film heroes not the ones actually saving anyone, 3) shits all over my favorite franchise in the MCU, Captain America, by suddenly making SHIELD highly functioning and good again. (And don't me give that bullshit line from Fury about skeleton crew, rusty ship and favors. There isn't a single one of these things between the US Military and Stark Industries, yet SHIELD, in its depleted state, can pull one out of their ass within 20 minutes of catastrophe [and don't get me started with the AoS tie-in]).  The film, as a whole, felt like an advertisement for future Marvel films. Cap and Tony feuding, Thor gon' simming, and what's his name with his city getting ripped up. I would be ecstatic about that if it was don't well, but it wasn't real development. Each part wasn't all that motivated, nor was it necessary action to our current film. It was Feig telling Joss ""we need these elements in so people will watch CW, Ragnorak, and Black Panther.""   Finally, as HiSHE put it, this wasn't really The Age of Ultron, so much as ""The Minor Set Back of Ultron."" For as well acted and as beautifully rendered as Ultron was, he wasn't thoroughly explained or at all motivated. I'm probably one of the few who doesn't appreciate the knew additions to the team, either. They were thrown in haphazardly, weren't developed, and are each far too powerful to have any tension or fear come later films. I guess that's more opinion, though.  I did enjoy the film, believe it or not. I thought the action was fun, and some of the dialogue still stuck. I loved the development of Banner and Natasha, and I really, really fucking wish they could had told this entire film from Hawkeye's perspective. He was brilliant. Now that we know his protected back story and how he sees himself in relation to the team, I really hope he plays a pivotal role in CW.  That said, for being the whole purpose of the MCU, Ultron is incredibly muddled and dumbed-down. Marvel's last for releases were TWS, GotG, Agent Carter and Daredevil. To be fair, that's the best run, creatively, by the studio. AoU didn't maintain that momentum. It just felt lazy."
marvelstudios,3dcod5,notshawnvaughn,-3,Wed Jul 15 14:23:48 2015 UTC,"No they didn't. Don't try and act like the second films shortcomings were down to expectations because it's not true at all. In fact many had lower expectations because they thought the first film was really good.  Regardless of expectations, the basics you expect from a film is a well done plot, good pacing, solid acting and a villain with a strong motivation and who provides a genuine threat. The only one I can safely say the film had there was solid acting. Regardless of hype or expectations, in my opinion and that of many, the film fell flat in many basic film related stuff. The first film isn't even anything special in terms of storytelling, it just did things right. A simple but good plot, not too many sub plots (Black Widow/Hulk just why), a consistent pace that always kept you engaged and a good villain. It was the ultimate popcorn flick.   I hope we get an extended cut on Blu-Ray. The pacing is all over the place and it needs to be at least 2 and a half hours long, it would change the film for the better.   edit: Downvoting opinions like the good little fanboys you are."

marvelstudios,3dcod5,LochNessMonocle,2,Thu Jul 16 05:58:12 2015 UTC,"I liked Ultron's evil plan better than Loki's. Loki just wanted to rule Earth and take away free will (I guess). Ultron wanted humanity to change. He reasoned that if the extinction level event that killed off the dinosaurs caused humans to evolve into the dominant species, then another event would possibly cause mankind to evolve into something better than what they are now. Although once the Avengers took away his ideal body (the Vision), he pretty much said fuck it, kill everyone."

marvelstudios,3dcod5,aces08,12,Wed Jul 15 16:45:06 2015 UTC,"No, OP. You're not alone. There's a lot of people who think AoU was better, but they quietly hide in the shadows, lest they feel the wrath of the circlejerk. And, if I can be honest, most of the haters boil down to just four or five users that feel the need to spam every thread or comment with their negativity.  Yes, Age of Ultron was a much better film than the Avengers. I don't think it takes someone with a film school degree to be able to set the two apart in terms of quality. I'll be completely honest, I knew the Avengers didn't cut it after Winter Soldier came out, followed by the equally awesome Guardians of the Galaxy. These films, to me, far surpassed the Avengers in more ways than one, and I couldn't watch Earth's Mightiest Heroes the same way again.  I think what bugged me the most about the Avengers was how cheap it looked. The costumes looked terrible. (Cap looked like he was wearing something for Halloween.) The lack of filter and cinematography in so many scenes gave it a made-for-TV look. And probably the most distracting aspect of it all boiled down to the set pieces. Way too much of the film took place aboard the helicarrier, with giant metal walls surrounding the cast. It just looked like they were sitting on a set, and the film got boring real fast because of it. A movie needs a change of scenery to stay fresh and exciting. The final battle wasn't great either. It looked like they were standing in front of a giant green screen on a massive set. Part of this feeling comes from the fact that everything around them looked completely still and lifeless. Let's see some people in peril for God's sakes! Instead, we see mostly empty buildings and rubble everywhere.  Now compare this with Age of Ultron, which had much better costumes all around, an actual filter on the camera (which masks some of the more obvious CG effects), and way larger and more detailed set pieces. Instead of being confined to a single room, the Avengers are constantly on the move, going from continent to continent, trying to stop Ultron's next move. Each setting feels teeming with life, which gives us a real sense of danger when the action starts happening.  In addition to the overall production value, the film also greatly improves in the drama and action department. There's tons of substantial moments scattered throughout the movie, whether we're seeing the Avengers coming to blows over the creation of Ultron(and subsequently Vision), or seeing each hero relive their worst fears. The romance between Bruce and Natasha opened up a lot of insecurities within the two, making both characters more vulnerable as a result. The moments between Ultron and the twins felt quite sentimental at times, and I never once felt like he was using the twins as mere puppets. (more on the depth of Ultron later.) The battle on Sokovia was also teeming with dramatic moments, whether it was the realization that Cap might have to sacrifice the few for the many, or the eventual death of Pietro, which was so much better handled than the death of Agent Coulson. The last scene between Ultron and Vision was perhaps one of the most beautiful moments out of the MCU thus far, with the exception maybe going to Cap and Peggy.  The action and tension throughout the film was also on a scale which the Avengers cannot hope to match. 50% of the action is mostly gunfighting. If anybody is going to watch the Avengers, they're going to skip to the final act. A final act which is comprised of Avengers fighting generic aliens on jet skis. There was some really choppy editing in that final action sequence. Age of Ultron felt way more choreographed in the way it showed each individual Avenger contributing his/her own to the team, rather than random cuts halfway across the city. And the tension was greater too. We see actual civilians crowding the streets in peril. Ultron gets close to achieving his goal, as opposed to Loki, who's plan seems to fall short after opening the portal. The Chitauri were supposed to be this ominous threat, but the Avengers had no trouble taking them out. Speaking of which....  Ultron was a much better villain than Loki in the context of the Avengers. Loki was a great villain in Thor, and a great sort of anti-hero in the sequel. But his appearance in the Avengers just didn't cut it. His plan to bring about an alien invasion didn't make any sense. Thanos' army wasn't that big, and if the Avengers couldn't handle it, I'm sure the US Air Force could. Loki's reasoning for bringing about an invasion was also very one-dimensional. Wanting to rule the world is a very generic thing to do, and I didn't feel the pain or isolation that he had in Thor, or even  The Dark World.  Ultron gets a lot of flack for his sense of humor. I actually kept a tally of his jokes from the sequel, and a very liberal score was about seven jokes in the whole movie. I say liberal because some of those lines were much more clever than funny. Only one line actually felt out-of-character. The rest of Ultron's appearance on screen consisted of grandiloquent speeches or menacing phrases directed at the heroes. Ultron wasn't a one-dimensional villain at all. His relationship with the twins defined his whole being. They had the courage and the willpower to change. Change... that's a word that Ultron kept bringing up time and time again. He wanted to change the human race. And just like with Wanda or Pietro, the human race needed to struggle in order bring about their greatness. That's why he had to kill so many people. Not because he just wanted to kill, but because the resulting struggle would convince the rest of humanity to adapt and accept the Vision transformation.  TL;DR: The Avengers is a flawed movie. It's just that it's been hyped to no end because it's something that's never been seen before. The feeling of awe and wonder, however, is gone, and seeing Thor on the same screen as Iron Man is no longer a spectacle. Age of Ultron was destined to be a disappointment because no matter what the quality of the film was, people weren't going to see Thor, Cap, and Iron Man assemble for the first time."
marvelstudios,3dcod5,the1egend1ives,6,Thu Jul 16 03:13:51 2015 UTC,"I like them equally, AoU I felt had a better villian and better action scenes. But there was no single epic moment that stood out from the rest whereas in the first it was the team standing side by side after Hulk punched that flying alien thing, it was the moment where everyone was like holy shit this is the avengers and they are now here. I also felt that it had a bit of a pacing problem, third act felt slightly rushed."
marvelstudios,3dcod5,adzbat33,3,Wed Jul 15 16:00:40 2015 UTC,"My problem with AOU is that it didn't feel like a big epic movie. If it were anything close to how it as in the trailers than yeah it would have been great but it wasn't.   The stakes felt small. Honestly the whole film felt more a like a mid season finale rather than the actual finale to phase 2.   Also as I have stated before I hate the muted filter they went with. Especially for a movie that didn't really take itself seriously. And believe it or not despite what some say, the opening scene in the forest had some really weird CGI at certain points.   I can't wait for the Russo's to take over with there action. It is way easier to follow.   Overall I was disappointed with AOU."
marvelstudios,3dcod5,tigolebities,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:23:14 2015 UTC,"I think I remember (emphasis on ""think"") reading something about how Whedon didn't want to raise the stakes but wanted to make the film (AoU) more personal. And boy was it more personal.  The first Avengers dealt with an outside villain: Loki and his outside army. Whereas the second, the villain was literally a creation of the Avengers themselves. The Avengers themselves were the villains.   Ultron being a creation of Stark and Banner. Even with the Ironman/Hulk fight, that was all the Avengers destroying the city."
marvelstudios,3dcod5,nocheslas,3,Wed Jul 15 16:20:45 2015 UTC,"Avengers 1 was definitely more balanced than Age of Ultron. If Age of Ultron was a more balanced film in its execution and had been more high stakes with Ultron as far as making him more menacing and less funny, It would have knocked the first Avengers out of the water for me. As it is though, they are tied for me most days while I occasionally consider the first better."

marvelstudios,3dcod5,blazomkd,2,Wed Jul 15 06:32:39 2015 UTC,"I much preferred the first one. The second one tried to put too much in and ended up with too combat heavy in comparison to character development.

The second was a bloated mess. IMO, of course."

marvelstudios,3dcod5,Supertrinko,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:53:14 2015 UTC,No. Avengers was like good and still is good...but idk. It definitely feels separate from the other films. I think it's because we'd really never seen the characters together. Tbh for both parts of Infinity War I want Marvel to not give a shit and make the movies like 2 hours and 40 minutes long each and just have scenes of the characters having fun. They live together. They are on a team together. There would be more bonding going on. We definitely saw some of it in AoU but I want to see more.  Also imagine how much the X-Men movies would benefit if they actually used them as a team?? We've literally never seen the X-Men work as a team in live action (closest we've got is Colossus throwing Wolverine).
marvelstudios,3dcod5,ashtonknapp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:21:41 2015 UTC,"Nope, me too, for one the story is better, especially the villain's motivation/actions. People just like it less because the specialness of saying all these guys together has worn of a bit."

marvelstudios,3dcod5,Shadow_Gabriel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:48:30 2015 UTC,"You are definitely not the only one.  I really enjoyed the movie, and liked it, as a whole, better than Avengers.  I get why people were frustrated with it.  I agree with some of the complaints, but not all.  I do think they failed to really capture how big of a threat Ultron was.  The groundwork was there, but they just didn't follow through properly.  I was expecting that they wouldn't be able to capture the real despair of the ""Age of Ultron"" because it is a 2 and a half hour movie.  It would be really difficult to pull that off.  As it was, I ended up liking the way Ultron was characterized, I just felt like they missed opportunities to show just how he was everywhere.  That is my only real complaint though, other than the missing Thor stuff.  Beyond that, I enjoyed it from start to finish.  I thought the pacing was great.  Some transitions were iffy, but the pacing felt good.  I was engaged the entire time.  I didn't feel that way with the first Avengers.  I felt like it lagged at times in the first half.  I thought the character development was great and the interactions were new and interesting.  I know many would disagree, but I also thought Joss did a good job of having the characters in the places, emotionally, where me might expect them to be after the other movies.  Also, the effects were just so stinking good.  The Hulk was fantastic in this movie.  He was an actual character instead of just a giant prop.  Vision looked freaking perfect.  I thought they did really well with Wanda's and Pietro's powers and the costumes were all really cool.  So yeah, I genuinely loved it.  I can see where people are coming from with a lot of the complaints, I just respectfully disagree.  If I had the money and opportunity, I probably would have already seen it in theaters a dozen times."
marvelstudios,3dcod5,acemerrill,3,Wed Jul 15 11:36:38 2015 UTC,The missing thor stuff was like the only thing I wish they had kept heavily involved with the movie. It may take a few people out of the movie but it'll provide a great exposition to build up to Ragnarok and Infinity War. It would've probably made people go to see Thor 3 too if they had showed a lot of that.

I don't think AoU would really make a lot of sense if you've never watched an avengers movie, and I think the Avengers just generally had better flow throughout. AoU really got you into the action a lot sooner though.  If you prefer movies with better plot flow and/or never seen an avengers movie, Avengers is better.  If you prefer action packed thrill rides and/or have already invested in the franchise, AoU is better"

I judge these movies on entertainment value and how happy I am whenever I watch it over and over again. I could watch AOU on repeat for a week, but I will never watch Iron man 3 again.

marvelstudios,3dcod5,ChocoboTorchicKid,0,Wed Jul 15 12:23:42 2015 UTC,"I mean Avengers was the first of its kind, it's hard to top it. Avengers was the first time we saw the heroes (and Loki) bounce their personalities off of each other, and of course, the final action sequence in Manhattan is satisfying and a blast to watch. These feats are hard to top. It's unfair to say: AoU did action and character interaction well, but Avengers did them first.   It's worth mentioning that Avengers directly picked up the stories of Loki and the Tesseract from Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger, making it feel more like a climax of Phase 1 as a whole. Age of Ultron continues nothing from the other Phase 2 movies, (which is respectable, you can't continue every plot thread and it's introducing new ideas) it's not as satisfying.    Call it raising my expectations too high, but Age of Ultron falls just short of being better than the first for me. Ultron is more or less a rehash of Loki (a snarky villain with a personal connection to one of the Avengers, a doomsday device, and an army of henchmen). I was hoping for Ultron to be a smaller, more personal threat to the Avengers--testing their endurance and friendship. We saw a little bit of that in the film, but it's sidelined for other plot threads (Barton's family, Banner/Romanoff relationship, etc.)  The only minor gripes I have is that the Thor/Infinity well side plot feels out of place, and Strucker was absolutely wasted as a villain. Ultimately, Age of Ultron is not a disappointment. I saw what Whedon was going for and respect him for pulling off what he did: it's a great movie, but it's not the first Avengers."
marvelstudios,3dcod5,ThatGuyOnTheRoof,0,Wed Jul 15 12:28:20 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with character development. In 1 we saw growth main characters.

marvelstudios,3dcod5,Oprime1,0,Wed Jul 15 14:28:44 2015 UTC,"I like AOU much more than A1 as well. I like that they delved deeper into the characters, and it felt like Whedon was actually trying to say something with this film (as opposed to the first film, which felt like a monster truck rally at times). Ultron is a much more interesting villain than Loki, neurotic and angry. His ""birth"" is one of the coolest depictions of an abstract digital environment I've ever seen. It's a packed cast, ten main characters, but they all justify their presence. It also has the best Infinity Stone in the MCU; the Mind Stone isn't just a glowing object of destruction, it's an object of creation.  Having said that, the action is worse in AOU, less coherent and more confusing. I also have issues with the end; the Avengers' basic plan is ""punch Ultron until there's no more Ultron left to punch."" It's not a clever plan, and I figured Whedon would be smarter than ""might makes right."" At times, the battle in Sokovia was totally incoherent visually. Tony Stark is perhaps the most cartoony he's ever been, and it seems like he feels no consequences from the creation of Ultron. I figure it'll come up during Civil War, but it really needed to be felt here. Stark was also almost completely sidelined during the final fight, his presence barely felt at all. I wish that Ultron would've captured Stark instead of Widow; I think the creation of Vision would've resonated more if Stark himself was not in the room, making the exact same choice that created Ultron.  TBH, I think Avengers is my least favorite Marvel series. I deeply love Iron Man 3, Cap 2, Thor 2, GOTG and Cap 1, but both Avengers films have left me colder than the individual solo films."
marvelstudios,3dcod5,SuperCoenBros,0,Wed Jul 15 14:55:25 2015 UTC,"When I went to watch it a second time, I enjoyed it a lot better. I think two things happened. 1. The marketing fucked up.

That's all conjecture, but if Jessica Jones releases near the end of the year, a good way to get the word out would be to put some adverts for it on the DD release.  And putting Age of Ultron out near or same date as the shows would get people into stores and see them on the shelf side by side, possibly boosting sales in a ""hey, this is out too?"" moment."

At one point he walks across the barrel of a gun.  That should be an extra 200 pounds of weight.  But honestly, the mass of your average muscular man being compressed to roughly the size of an ant would have the density of something like a neutron star.  Likewise, this would make the enlarging physics super wonky, too.  Giant Man would have the density of a piece of styrofoam if his mass stays the same but his size increases, unless he finds some way to add mass to himself.  Hell, Pym specifically says that the suit can reduce you to a subatomic level, which would mean it can actually reduce to the space between your atoms to such a degree that the entirety of them are smaller than an atom.

marvelstudios,3dbz26,polishingcheekbones,160,Fri Jul 17 02:19:11 2015 UTC,"Fuckin finally saw it!! I enjoyed this so much. Quick thoughts off the top of my head:   It's amazing how refreshingly standalone and small-scale (pun intended) the story is. No world shattering stakes here, no convoluted infinity gem-centric plot holes. Just straightforward contained storytelling here. It doesn't change the face of the MCU but it nevertheless packs a good amount of fun and makes for decent tight storytelling.  Michael Pena just hogs all the humor. Hands down the best side character comic relief in any MCU property, IMO. Way more enjoyable than the likes of Happy Hogan or Darcy. His storytelling sequences were super fun. The audience in the theater I was in roared when Stan Lee showed up.   Scott Lang is probably the best MCU dad along with Jack Murdock.  While his performance wasn't on par with the RDJ levels of show stealing in first IM film, Paul Rudd still manages to charm the hell out of you. There is no better Scott Lang out there right now.  All those shrinking and ant scenes were just fantastic. My favorite has to be the bathtub sequence. Amazing visuals we haven't seen in the MCU. That whole microverse thing - talk about getting a taste of the Space Odyssey trippyness we'll be having in Dr. Strange.  Was not expecting that Falcon scene to be in the middle of the movie!! Seeing Falcon stand guard over the Avengers facility felt so much like the comics where the Avengers defend the Mansion from intruders.   Seeing the Wasp flutter beside Hank Pym was a beauty to see. The reveal of the new Wasp suit made a great mid credits scene too. Totally dig the 1989 flashback at the Triskelion. That's one era in the MCU we haven't seen. Felt giddy seeing an aging Peggy and John Slattery-Howard Stark.  Nothing new on this front but Darren Cross was so and so. Might be on par with Justin Hammer in IM2. Very underused. I did however love his banter with Hank in the house. The whole ""Why did you choose me?"" ""Because I saw too much of myself in you"" back and forth gave both Hank and Darren a little bit of more depth. Would have loved to see more of his psychosis! Apeshit Yellowjacket could have been awesome and terrifying.   The Mitch Carson character felt really unnecessary. Hank Pym just beats him up and he just stands around the rest of the film. Brought nothing to the story except more loose ends to set up more Ant-Man stories which I guess is beneficial in the long run but still. The film would've been tighter without him.  Surprised they play the whole ""I hate heroes"" angle of Hank Pym pretty low key. I remember them talking about how much of an important thing it was. Those 'Hank Pym siding with Tony in Civil War' rumors are becoming more unlikely to me.   Would have loved to see more of Hank Pym's escapades in the past.  A lot of the emotional scenes were placed oddly, particularly those Hope-Hank scenes in the house. A few of them felt really random and somewhat forced to me. The same with the Scott/Hope kiss scene in the end.  Was that a Spider-Man reference at the end??? AND HOLY FUCK THEY FOUND BUCKY. It seems to be a scene set in between the events of Civil War. It's strongly implicit that Stark has his sights on Bucky and that Steve is actively protecting him. It's been a while since we had a post credits scene as crucial as this."
marvelstudios,3dbz26,PlatFleece,55,Wed Jul 15 10:43:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, you made some awesome points!  Hank does talk about Tony being an idiot and the Iron Man suit paling in comparison to the particle tech. I thought it was enough - it comes through that he doesn't care for SHIELD and superheroes and the danger involved with his inventions without becoming an unnecessary focal point. I think this movie needed to focus on a few things and do them well. Mission accomplished.  I loved the fact that humor softened some of the potential WTF-ness where you're trying to get behind, for example, ant sidekicks. It's quite an accomplishment when you get people cheering for the ants by the end of the movie.  I thought it telling that the two scenes showing Janet van Dyne didn't show her face, thus leaving the casting decision open for the future. Obviously the success of this film will dictate if we get to see a microverse-based sequel.  I also like what you said about the plot and its scale. It's about tech invented in the 80s (or potentially before that - I don't think they're clear on this, and of course we're talking about MCU not comics). And 30+ years later, its creator is worried his protege is about to rediscover it and sell it, so he's acting to protect it. So much better than, say, Stark creating a series of armor suits, and all of a sudden a bunch of people are able to create suits that rival his."
marvelstudios,3dbz26,pacotacobell,44,Thu Jul 16 01:29:21 2015 UTC,"Was that Mitch Carson guy the one Darren sold the Yellowjacket tech to? He casually mentioned Hydra, so it sorta connected the whole SHIELD-Hydra infiltration, since he seemed like one of the big guys back then, chillin' with Peggy and Howard in the first scene and all."
marvelstudios,3dbz26,kaimason1,30,Wed Jul 15 15:18:38 2015 UTC,"Yes. He also is the immediate superior of Eric O' Grady/Ant-Man/Black Ant in the comics. I could see him passing on the Yellowjacket serum onto the next Pym Particle villain.   But yeah, he really didn't serve any purpose at the end. He was presented in the beginning as a threat yet sort of dozed of later in the movie."
marvelstudios,3dbz26,tuskernini,16,Wed Jul 15 15:27:55 2015 UTC,If Eric O' Grady gets turned into a villain in the MCU I'd actually find it comically fitting that the two most controversial Ant-Men (Yellowjacket Hank Pym and Eric) are antagonists for Scott

marvelstudios,3dbz26,shotterken,20,Thu Jul 16 15:29:23 2015 UTC,"That whole microverse thing   Waitwaitwait. I haven't seen the movie yet (probably shouldn't be in this thread, but I'm not very spoiler averse and don't have much self control), but they legitimately mention/show the actual microverse in this movie? Or are you just talking about visually cool miniature scenes?   Totally dig the 1989 flashback at the Triskelion. That's one era in the MCU we haven't seen.   Technically it has shown up in Agents of SHIELD, after Howard and Peggy's iron grip over SHIELD loosened around that period HYDRA was able to become more active and free Whitehall, leading to his dissection of Jiaying.  EDIT: Now that I've seen the film, some observations, rather than making a new comment. I do agree with most of this analysis. I would add that I found the electric ants frying the server thing pretty silly, though that's one of my only complaints. I thought I'd hate Scott's friends but I actually found their scenes to be welcome comic relief, and as pointed out far better than past throwaway comic relief characters like Darcy. Also did anyone else catch the hints at Hank's mental instability (i.e. his own Yellowjacket persona)? I'd have liked more connection between Darren Cross's Yellowjacket suit and Hank's mental instability but what we got was still pretty cool. All in all, I'd say this is probably my third favorite MCU film, not quite beating out Winter Soldier or Guardians but surprisingly better than either Avengers movie, something I certainly never expected (even though I did expect it to be better than the silly name/concept or fan expectations would suggest, I only expected it to be like best of pre-Avengers [for me, that's Iron Man and the First Avenger] quality, not near the top of Phase 2)."

There is no better Scott Lang out there right now.   Definitely agree with his charms. But, did you also feel like his Scott Lang is kinda similar to Chris Pratt's Peter Quill?"
marvelstudios,3dbz26,Alvinng9,23,Thu Jul 16 18:30:38 2015 UTC,"I don't agree, Pratt's Quill is an insecure guy projecting, Lang seems like an older guy who has played the smart ass card for a long time, and he is also more charming."

marvelstudios,3dbz26,ShadyBiz,51,Wed Jul 15 03:25:17 2015 UTC,"I figured it was that at that point, Tony knows about the Winter Soldier's actions (involving his parents), so it is likely Tony would want revenge/could not be trusted with Bucky's well being."
marvelstudios,3dbz26,oliyoung,35,Wed Jul 15 03:45:46 2015 UTC,I think the scene is from the middle of Civil War
marvelstudios,3dbz26,vaultofechoes,9,Wed Jul 15 05:22:45 2015 UTC,"Huh, I never took it as that. If that's the case, this would mean Ant-man would most likely be in the final act, which makes me very happy. Here's for hoping!"
marvelstudios,3dbz26,3MinuteHero,14,Wed Jul 15 05:26:33 2015 UTC,"They mentioned that ""The Accords"" wouldn't let them.  Maybe some new legislation governing supers? Seems civil warry."

Can we also just appreciate the showcase of how ant summoning and especially shrinking are dangerous, even revolutionary powers? Hank Pym was right to be dismissive, the Starks are just basic ass tinkerers compared to what he achieved. He is much more of a pure Scientist than Stark, maybe even Banner."
marvelstudios,3dbz26,DeviantSpirit,50,Thu Jul 16 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah you don't get purer than quantum physics. Stark and Banner don't know shit about quantum physics.

It was really refreshing after all the cities being destroyed, world hanging in the balance type blockbusters we've been seeing every summer. The humour killed, the cast was fantastic, the pacing was great and the shrinking effects were astonishing (pun intended). I love that they really took the third act to develop these characters and build this world before getting into the cool heist stuff. I'd easily put it in my top 5 MCU films. Also, those two fantastic credits scenes really made for AoU's disappointing teaser."

This time?    There's a hole in the ceiling there"

marvelstudios,3dbz26,shotterken,93,Wed Jul 15 13:07:18 2015 UTC,"So Michael Peña was at the art gallery with Danny Vasquez, and Danny Vasquez told him about a recent occasion when he met Anna Akana at a bar, and Anna Akana told Danny Vasquez that she had had a meeting with Anthony Mackie where Anthony Mackie had asked her to try to find out information about a guy that shrinks (Paul Rudd).  So then Paul Rudd asks Michael Peña: did Anthony Mackie tell Anna Akana to tell Danny Vasquez to tell Michael Peña to tell Paul Rudd the story about Anthony Mackie meeting Anna Akana and asking about Paul Rudd because Michael Peña is tight with Paul Rudd? Yes.  Basically, Anthony Mackie is on Paul Rudd's trail."

So it might not be as obvious, especially if they have tech to see airline passengers and he wasn't on any plays.  Thinking about it though, he probably did look up Scott and just talked to the journalist person to let Scott know he is on to him without confronting him in person. Hence why he asks the journalist to tell the story to Luis' friend."
marvelstudios,3dbz26,hindukid,40,Thu Jul 16 16:12:56 2015 UTC,"I assumed it was a ""can I join the Avengers?"" because the previous scene was Scott picking up the phone for ""work""."

marvelstudios,3dbz26,Carfrito,37,Wed Jul 15 04:35:02 2015 UTC,"I loved it. I watched it last night during an employee screening for the movie theater I work for.  -I'm glad to see that Scott actually ""talks"" to the ants. I was really afraid that he was just going to be commanding them in his mind, so I'm happy that you can physically hear what he's saying.  -Michael Pena is SO FUCKING hilarious. Every time he would open his mouth it would be a great joke.  -David Dastmalchian's character bothered me. He didn't bring anything to the movie besides the goofy Russian accent.   -The emotional scenes, such as when Hank tells how Janet died, feel a little out of place. Just the fact that they go from a funny scene to this super emotional scene to a funny scene again threw me off a little.  -The battle with Falcon is definitely my favorite scene in all of the MCU. I can't wait to see more of that stuff during civil war.  -Shout out to the Spider-Man reference. Shit had me looking around the theater to see everyone's reactions.   -I was bummed that there weren't more flashbacks of Hank and Janet working as Ant-Man and Wasp. They could've explored that avenue a little more.  -Gah Dayum those end credits scenes. I was hoping for a wasp scene during the actual movie, but I'll take what we got. Plus BUCKY which was great. Civil War hype train is officially off the rails.  -Also RIP Antony, you were small in our minds but not in our hearts."
marvelstudios,3dbz26,ParadoxWarrior,39,Thu Jul 16 16:07:53 2015 UTC,"So the original Wasp was a suit with wings built into the suit.  No bio-blasters of any sort.  What do you think the odds are that when Wasp comes back from subatomic it'll be with wings, bio-blasters and the ability to shrink organically after spending 30 years in sub-atomic space.  Also she finally shows up in the flesh Doctor Strange.  One more thing, I loved Hank in this.  The guy took non to fools and it showed but maybe in the opening prologue it showed how his particles affected him making him slightly more violent than normal.  I think in one movie he cussed more than the previous Avengers which was pretty neat."
marvelstudios,3dbz26,Rebelsuns,31,Thu Jul 16 08:09:51 2015 UTC,I don't think the original Wasp is going to come back.
marvelstudios,3dbz26,oliyoung,28,Thu Jul 16 17:55:13 2015 UTC,"This. Please. We already have Hope taking on the new Wasp suit.   And we don't want another case of ""this-character-died-and-is-back-again-eliminating-the-drama-from-earlier"" (I know she's sub-atomic but since it's been so long she might as well be dead)"
marvelstudios,3dbz26,ThebigP,9,Fri Jul 17 02:32:40 2015 UTC,"If they don't do it, they could go with the obvious excuse of ""she's shrunk so much that she's gone forever."" After all, it's established that Hank still doesn't know much about the Microverse, so there we go."
marvelstudios,3dbz26,PlatFleece,16,Fri Jul 17 03:39:22 2015 UTC,Was there a reference to Spider-Man in the end or mid credits?

marvelstudios,3dbz26,gabeward28,15,Thu Jul 16 14:46:36 2015 UTC,I really like the battle scenes between yellowjacket and scott as they throw remarks at each other in that echo-ey voice
marvelstudios,3dbz26,capt_dacca,17,Thu Jul 16 09:06:26 2015 UTC,Something that bugged me. What's Scott's job now? Does he work security for Hank? The Avengers don't get paid do they? It's not like he actually found a 9-5 job at the end of the movie
marvelstudios,3dbz26,Bruce_Bruce,19,Thu Jul 16 15:36:52 2015 UTC,He could probably be hired as an assistant. But it is pretty obvious Pym works outside the law so technically Scott is still a criminal in a sense.

Actually, every single Ant-Man fight scene was, but that one was especially gratifying because even my friends (whom I had to drag to the cinema to watch this with anyway) did a total 180 with how spectacularly Ant-Man whooped Falcon's ass.  Also, I'm sorry for being an idiot, but can anyone explain those electric ants he used in the servers? Are they resistant to electricity? Because, is it possible for Scott to cover himself with a swarm of those then have a perfect armor against Thor's lightnings?"

Loved the amount of comedy in the movie, the visual effects were dam amazing and they didn't over do the fighting as much as other movies.  It was also a movie that's worth the watch in 3D, not all movies need it, and I guess you don't 'need' it here but I think it added to the movie.  This movie did not get the hype I can now say it deserved."

marvelstudios,3dgtvh,emptylawn0,8,Thu Jul 16 04:01:45 2015 UTC,"Wolverine & the X-Men and Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes are great animated series on Netflix. From what I've heard Spectacular Spider-Man is also great but it's not on Netflix. I'm not sure if it's still on but the 90s X-Men series is also awesome. Also the Justice League series are really great if you like DC. I'll add more if I think of any.   EDIT: I'll add some non comic shows too. Arrested Development and Community are both great sitcoms that the Russo Bros. worked on heavily before Winter Soldier, they're definitely not of the same tone as WS but are really funny and lighthearted, AD is on Netflix but Community isn't though both are worth a watch if you haven't already. Also Avatar: The Last Airbender and it's sequel series Legend of Korra are possibly the two greatest animated shows ever and their tone is similar to the MCU, neither are on Netflix but are definitely worth a watch if you haven't seen them."

PoI is more dark and gritty, and Chuck is more fun and light-hearted.  In terms of animated shows, definitely give Young Justice, Avatar: The Last Airbender/Legend of Korra, Green Lantern: The Animated Series, and Star Wars: The Clone Wars a shot. Also Spectacular Spidey but that's not on Netflix.   Grimm is more of a procedural show than PoI or Chuck (and PoI has some procedural elements), but it's also pretty superhero esque. Another fun procedural show is Psych, it's more of a comedy-detective series dealing with a guy who is pretending to be psychic (yes, like the Mentalist, but not as dramatic. They even reference the Mentalist in the show, which is neat).   So, to sum this up in a nice list (not all of these are on Netflix):   Person of Interest Chuck Young Justice Avatar: The Last Airbender/The Legend of Korra Green Lantern: The Animated Series Star Wars: The Clone Wars Spectacular Spider-Man Grimm Psych   EDIT: Also, I watched Avengers: The Earth's Mightiest Heroes. I liked it, but I don't think it's as good as the other animated shows I listed. It's worth watching if you want more Marvel material, but I personally don't plan on rewatching it or buying it myself, which I'm open to doing with all of the shows on the list above (except maybe for Grimm, which I felt has gone down in quality in the latest season that aired)."

Been waiting/hoping for him to appear since they first announced going cosmic with the MCU, be sorely disappointed if he doesn't make it, brilliant character. If they could introduce Adam in Guardians 2, he could certainly appear in Infinity War with an integral role.  This is part of why I disliked giving Vision an Infinity Gem, might reduce the chances of seeing Warlock, also with a (soul) gem in his forehead. Possible that he appears without that or in a different form, which I can only hope.  It's possible Vision takes his place, but I kind of think it's likely that Vision is the first casualty of the war, with the mind gem being ripped from his head, maybe being what brings the Avengers into the fold."

marvelstudios,3ddbhz,FranchiseTag,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:59:41 2015 UTC,"If anything, I thought Vision's backstory made Adam Warlock's appearance MORE likely.  Remember, Helen Cho's expertise was said to be creating synthetic flesh... I think they're going to create Warlock on Earth just like they created Vision.  Perhaps Vision dies in Infinity Part I, so they make Warlock in Infinity II. Or perhaps they get the Soul Gem on Earth at some point, and need to create someone to wield it.  Warlock will be more powerful than Vision, but I think they can play up the differences between them. Warlock will be more detached and calculating. He'll put up a noble front, but seem a little bit creepy. Basically they can show the thin line between Superman and Dr. Manhattan.  And then, after Infinity War II, he can head to space with the Guardians, who then have to team up with Thanos to defeat Magus. People want the Magus story for Guardians 2, and I think that is pretty clearly not happening, but I think it would make more sense for Guardians 3 anyways. It would basically continue escalating things beyond Infinity War II, if the good guys had to team up with Thanos to defeat someone, and that someone turned out to be the future version of the Messiah-level character. The preposterousness of that story works better after Infinity War IMO."

marvelstudios,3ddbhz,JuanRiveara,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:10:07 2015 UTC,"I doubt we'll see Adam Warlock. I read somewhere that James Gunn had no idea who he was, he just his cocoon in there because he it looked cool and then when finding out it was Adam Warlock's he just said that he exists. I also believe he said there would only be two new characters in Vol. 2 and their presumably Quill's father and a new Guardians. I don't think he'll be Quill's father for a plethora of reasons I won't go into now and the rumor so far is that the new Guardians member will be female so that leaves out that possibility.   Vision seems likely to fill that role if he doesn't die if he loses his stone. Another option might be Dr. Strange if he does possess an Infinity Stone especially if it's the Soul Stone and you can explain his connection via magic."
marvelstudios,3ddbhz,charlie2094,2,Wed Jul 15 15:04:15 2015 UTC,"I'll try and find a source, but I'm pretty certain Gunn has stated before that Adam Warlock is a character he likes.

marvelstudios,3dex2n,DaBest13,2,Thu Jul 16 03:43:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's really likely that Infinity War will play out as one big arc across Phase 3 because that's what happened basically with Phase 1 and Phase 2.   Phase 1 starts with Iron Man, which ends with Fury telling Stark about the Avengers Initiative. This is followed by The Incredible Hulk, which ends with (as revealed by The Consultant One-Shot) a ploy to get Stark to infuriate Ross in order to obtain the Hulk for the team. Next comes Iron Man 2, which is more S.H.I.E.L.D. involvement with Stark (Fury, Coulson, Widow, etc.). After that we see Thor give us a little more S.H.I.E.L.D. (Coulson and Hawkeye) and show us the intro for Loki. Captain America: The First Avenger is about setting up the Tesseract and the beginning of S.H.I.E.L.D. (in the form of the SSR). Phase 1 then culminates with all the major players coming together in a huge and epic fight to save the world.  Phase 2 starts with Iron Man 3, which sets up the Iron Legion while also dealing with the fallout of Avengers and gives us the location of Stark and Banner throughout this phase. Then comes Thor: The Dark World, which is used to set up another Infinity Stone and establish that Thor is on Earth and Loki is playing the role of King of Asgard. After this comes Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which sets up the location of Rogers and Romanov in this phase while also showing the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. as it was known to the public. Then we get Guardians, which again sets up an Infinity Stone but also has some set-up for Infinity War. After this comes Age of Ultron, where we finally learn where Barton was throughout this phase, while also seeing the potential harm that the Iron Legion could bring and showing us that even without S.H.I.E.L.D. around the Avengers will fight to save our world. Ant-Man is a fitting conclusion for the phase because it reveals that [REDACTED] is an important character to the overall arc of this phase and gives us a tease of what's been happening at [REDACTED] since Age of Ultron ended."

But my personal theory (actually my hope) is that Civil War will be more than a one-and-done film and it will be the story arc that bleeds over to the other films up until Thanos gets here.   As I was typing that I came to a thought that would actually be pretty cool:  What if BOTH Civil War and Infinity War ""bleed over"" into other films. Basically, the Earth-based franchises will deal with the affects of the ""ongoing civil war"" or it's aftermath while the Cosmic-based films will deal with Thanos and his war for the Infinity Gauntlet. Then in IW Part 1 the two scenarios are thrown together. The Earth heroes then realize that to save the world they would have to stop their infighting. I think with the right writers in place, it could work (and even let each film be stand-alone while touching on themes from previous films)."

Spider-Man will probably be time-shifted somehow, since they intend to depict his high school years over the course of three-to-four films. GOTGV2 probably won't matter, just like its predecessor."

marvelstudios,3dbs2m,Shadow_Gabriel,9,Wed Jul 15 17:08:07 2015 UTC,Hot damn he looks like he's gonna be one of the best MCU villains. I can't control the hype I have for this movie
marvelstudios,3dbs2m,dirty30m,18,Wed Jul 15 01:22:59 2015 UTC,"Let's hope that he isn't one-and-done, but I get the feeling that is gonna be the case. Damn it Marvel stop killing off villains with potential in their first film! (Just to clarify I haven't seen it so I don't know; I'm just assuming given that we few villains that don't bite it in their first appearance)"
marvelstudios,3dbs2m,UmbrusNightshade,6,Wed Jul 15 01:30:50 2015 UTC,I prefer Marvel's approach of using villains once instead of recycling the same ones over and over again. It's good to see major villains like Loki and Thanos make multiple appearances (and hopefully Ultron will join that list) but not every minor villain needs to come back. This isn't the comics where they need a new story to tell every month. Plus it would undermine the heroes themselves if their villains are constantly retuning from defeat to wreak havoc again and again. The only reason I'd wanna see any of these villains come back is if they do a Thunderbolts movie.
marvelstudios,3dbs2m,apocalypsenowandthen,2,Wed Jul 15 09:29:18 2015 UTC,"I don't want every villain to make reappearances but Marvel is taking it too far to the ""one and done"" camp. Some villains are perpetual enemies while others are not. Ultron for example: if he doesn't reappear in the MCU down the line then they completely missed the point of this villain. He is a constant threat to the Avengers and to the Earth. Small time villains can go away and be okay. I actually think the fact that villains are killed off rather than being incarcerated undermines the heroes. The heroes, for the most part, are supposed to be moral and ""righteous"". Sure they all have their flaws and some are more ""killy"" than others, but with Cap around and other heroes like him there is far too many deaths and not enough arrests. It basically makes the heroes look like Punishers rather than Daredevils.   There should be one-off villains, but some should be left alive that can make appearances down the line. Keep someone alive and in prison and then wait like 4-8 films before you bring them back. It's also more realistic that way because if this were real life the heroes would be branded murderers due to the number of fatalities they incur."
marvelstudios,3dbs2m,UmbrusNightshade,4,Thu Jul 16 02:10:32 2015 UTC,"I've actually heard it on both ends of the spectrum. Some say that he is a tacked on addition, doesn't do much for the plot, and others say he is by far the greatest villain so far. We will have to wait and see."
marvelstudios,3dbs2m,pic2022,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:08:05 2015 UTC,I wouldn't go as far as to say he was the best villain. But he did have some genuinely scary moments in the film.

It just looks like DC and fox are spending more time on there villains. Anyways though, I really like what marvel is doing with WHIH. Makes the movies feel more immersive and real."
marvelstudios,3dbs2m,ReZ-115,5,Wed Jul 15 04:45:56 2015 UTC,"Im surprised more people don't signal out Fox for having Magneto be the villain in 5 out of 7 Xmen movies, even though I've seen complaints of too much Loki. The rest of the main villains are just generic, mutant haters (Stryker, Trask, Worthington) and the less said about Silver Samurai the better. But Apocalypse looks to be changing up the formula and DC are definitely putting a lot of stock into villains."

marvelstudios,3dbs2m,soulbreaker1418,3,Wed Jul 15 04:34:39 2015 UTC,"Avengers is an easier movie to market. You have a bunch of high profile super heroes all you have to do is a few big trailers and you will be fine. Marvel have done a fantastic job though at taking a character like Ant-Man who to the everyday public seems like a pretty boring super hero and making the movie seem really funny and entertaining. Props to Marvel, I think Black Panther will be the hardest to market though. That will be the real test if you ask me."
marvelstudios,3dbs2m,pq1226,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:06:47 2015 UTC,"my rules for good marketing are: don´t reveal the entire freaking movie on trailers, less is more,don´t lie(too much).You have to be concious that trailers do affect the perception of a movie just like Terminator showed. I´m a little more worried about Dr Strange, it should be relatively serious and weird, instead Black Panther will have Wakanda, the best looking country in the MCU with a more common plot"
marvelstudios,3dbs2m,soulbreaker1418,2,Wed Jul 15 21:31:24 2015 UTC,Yea but I think our world is sadly a bit too racist and that Black Panther will be the first marvel film with a Black Hero as the main character and I dont know if people are ready to handle that.

marvelstudios,3dcl5l,mithhunter55,3,Wed Jul 15 21:59:32 2015 UTC,"Right? As someone said on another thread, Marvel is all about taking superheroes from a comic book and putting them on a movie, but DC (so far) is about putting superheroes in our world, in a more realistic manner. I never liked the idea of starting from the middle out (first Batman v Superman and then the single movies), but after that trailer I'm extremely pumped.  Also, I love how DC castings have been as controversial as Marvel's so far, and it looks like they all pay off. One of the ones I didn't really like was Gal Gadot as WW because of how skinny she was and how little she looked like Diana, but now I seriously can't see her in the trailer. That's not Gal Gadot, that's literally Wonder Woman."

I don't think they'll delay any films to make room for it, though.  Like other people have said, they'll add the characters to other properties if they can't make a sequel until 2019 - Rudd is in Civil War, and he's a dead cert for the Avengers films if the solo film does well. They could even make a prequel series with Janet and Hank or something to keep people interested between films."

marvelstudios,3ddapb,rkkim,3,Wed Jul 15 15:46:46 2015 UTC,Sony didn't exactly give Spider-Man to Marvel. They still own him. They're basically just sharing him in a deal that is probably better for Sony than it is for Marvel.
marvelstudios,3ddapb,Amanoo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:17:24 2015 UTC,Mutually beneficial though. Marvel can use any spider characters and Sony gets shit tons of money and don't have to worry about advertising ever again.

marvelstudios,3ddapb,raysweater,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:17:44 2015 UTC,"James Gunn stated on his Facebook (when prompted by a fan) that Kang was owned by Fox.    http://i.imgur.com/iSoORCa.png  I think it is likely that Fox owns all iterations of this character, since he has close ties with both the Fantastic 4 (descendant of Reed Richards) and the X-Men (Rama-Tut, in the origin of the mutant Apocalypse).  However, since there are so many versions from alternate realities, I suppose that the MCU may have the rights to one specific version of the character, such as Immortus.  It's very unlikely, though."
marvelstudios,3ddapb,Amps2Eleven,3,Wed Jul 15 14:33:35 2015 UTC,"I can't understand how Fox owns Kang entirely, but has to share Wanda and Pietro. Kang is only potentially related to Reed through a retcon, and is almost entirely an Avengers villain"
marvelstudios,3ddapb,DMPunk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:42:03 2015 UTC,yeah but keep in mind Kang as Rama-tut first appeared in Fantastic 4 comics
marvelstudios,3ddapb,Honestfellow2449,2,Wed Jul 15 17:19:05 2015 UTC,Also a retcon. They were initially separate characters. And Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver both first appeared in X-Men. And Wolverine first appeared in Hulk but Marvel can't use him
marvelstudios,3ddapb,DMPunk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:05:03 2015 UTC,Gunn confirmed FOX owns Kang the Conquerer but since he has so many names I'm hoping the MCU can use one of those names like Immortus.

marvelstudios,3dc7vu,lazybeetroot,6,Wed Jul 15 04:50:41 2015 UTC,I always thought this would be a good idea for a movie. If they ever did an Iron Man 4 as a sendoff to Downey they should expand on the idea and have Banner paling around. I'd like to see Iron Man and Hulk fight some Ten Rings.
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,mustachio89,7,Wed Jul 15 05:16:12 2015 UTC,This would be my most anticipated movie immediately if it weee announced.

marvelstudios,3dc7vu,stormz96,0,Wed Jul 15 03:34:37 2015 UTC,How would that work? They two are completely different in tone and style.
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,Wombat_H,5,Wed Jul 15 18:36:28 2015 UTC,"They've been teaming up for literally decades in the comics, and it's been awesome. Just because the show has a different tone than what the spidey movies will be like doesn't mean they're stuck in that forever. The avengers all have different tones and styles but when they team up in the movies it all works."
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,stormz96,3,Wed Jul 15 19:01:53 2015 UTC,That's what'd make it. Deadpool and Wolverine works great I could see Matt and Peter working.
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,Mandalorianfist,-1,Wed Jul 15 18:44:05 2015 UTC,It's not the same at all. Spider-Man is going to be a John Hughes style coming of age movie. Daredevil is a gritty crime noir where mob bosses crush peoples heads with car doors.
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,Wombat_H,6,Wed Jul 15 18:46:31 2015 UTC,"Cap 1 was a WWII action flick with a 1940s tint in the style of ""The Rocketeer"" by the guy who made ""The Rocketeer."" Cap 2 was a smart modern action movie meshed with a 1970s political thriller in the style of ""3 Days of the Condor"" with the guy from ""3 Days of the Condor."" And the character worked in both movies.  These characters aren't limited in tone, though the individual films/series may be. We saw one story of Matt Murdock in a dark and bloody Hell's Kitchen, but I think the character is developed enough (and certainly the actor is talented enough) to have him fit into other parts of the MCU."
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,ProphetGentleman,6,Wed Jul 15 19:38:17 2015 UTC,Ant-Man has a team.
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,mithhunter55,10,Wed Jul 15 05:03:46 2015 UTC,"Absolutely it would be a smart move when it makes sense. The question is simply when does it make sense. Many fans have asked for a Black Widow/Hawkeye movie, and I think that works. Lots of other combinations could work, it's really just a matter of timing.   I think Marvel is on the right path. Their solo films have done a good job of developing the secondary characters and the Phase 2 solo films really emphasized the idea of Team Ups. Iron Man 3 was a buddy film with War Machine. The Dark World was a buddy film with Loki. The Winter Solider was a buddy film with Black Widow."
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,matty_nice,7,Wed Jul 15 04:14:29 2015 UTC,"Absolutely it would be a smart move when it makes sense   It would be hard for it not to make sense, though, so long as the writing is solid. For example, a Thor/Black Widow/Hulk team-up doesn't sound like it makes sense at all, but another poster in this sub suggested that Natasha go with Thor into space to find Banner (back when it was rumoured he'd fly into space in AoU), and they'd all end up on Asgard for Ragnarok."
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,potrap,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:36:39 2015 UTC,"It's not that hard for it not to make sense. I hope that makes sense.   The team up films have to make sense for the story, the actor's availability, the chemistry between the actors, and so on. I don't think a BW/Thor team up movie makes sense for the story, and the two don't really have great onscreen chemistry. I'd much rather see Thor with Cap for example, a duo that has much better chemistry onscreen and you could tie the story into the Red Skull's return with an Asgardian army."
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,matty_nice,4,Wed Jul 15 16:26:17 2015 UTC,"This is a good idea but only to a point. If every single film is gonna be required to have cameos and other ""main"" characters then there is absolutely no point to solo films. And I don't always wanna watch team up films. Sometimes it's good to have things that don't necessarily have to tie in directly (but rather indirectly). I don't know all of my brothers friends or his wife's family, but we both exist in the same universe. Sometimes an event with one of his friends or her family indirectly affects me (because I live with them at the moment). I'm just saying that there is a line that shouldn't be crossed with forcing all the films to be team films. Solo films help flesh things out for the individual characters."
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,UmbrusNightshade,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:34:46 2015 UTC,I get your point but its not forcing all films to be team films. It is making the context of the universe make sense. Like for example imagine if they wanted to make a spider-man cameo in Doctor Strange it makes sense in context because they are both New York based heroes. When an event happens in a solo movie it should affect another character in the MCU without having to call it a team up.
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,SwagBelow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:10:56 2015 UTC,"I wasn't saying that you are wanting all films to be team films. I was just pointing out that there are extremes (solo films without any connection to other characters and team films filled with connections). What I'm getting at is that we need both types and what would be considered the middle ground. Sure cameos and what not make sense and should happen, but only if it helps the story. It shouldn't be done just for the Hell of it. And I think that every now and again we should get a film that has more of an indirect connection than an overtly direct one."
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,UmbrusNightshade,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:03:49 2015 UTC,I get that but I think we are at the point where one superhero should at least show up in one film. The films are huge events and during these huge events a cameo by a hero or role in the film can help show that. Like for example in Doctor Strange movie Spider-man shows up because of the chaos of the Sanctum Sanctorum or Iron Man having a cameo because of Spider-Man fighting the sinster six. I feel like the MCU is at a point where they can do something like that. It is very similar to the comics in that way.
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,SwagBelow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:27:20 2015 UTC,"It should not be in every film. A lot of them, when it makes sense, sure ... but it shouldn't be in every, single film. Doing so just makes the MCU in general serialized rather than stand-alone and that is horrible, terrible marketing."
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,UmbrusNightshade,2,Thu Jul 16 05:08:47 2015 UTC,Marvel should make solo films to introduce new characters only and then put them in an ensemble cast.  This only works with some characters though.
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,Mike5482,2,Wed Jul 15 04:14:59 2015 UTC,"I think Spider-Man will have a level of team-up. Part of the deal is Sony gets access to MCU characters, right? I don't think they'll pass on an opportunity to have one of the Avengers drop in and I doubt they'll limit themselves to the supporting characters. They'll want someone to bring in an audience and a Spidey team-up movie can get people interested than just a standard reboot."
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,mustachio89,2,Wed Jul 15 05:13:29 2015 UTC,Opposite. Marvel gets rights to Spideys characters and creative control. The next SpiderMan movie will mainly be Feige run. So I have zero doubt some one will pop in. It won't be Sony made. Just final say and release.
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,lightningboltkid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:53:29 2015 UTC,I think there should be more team ups. It makes the universe more connective and make sense in context.  Like a spider-man cameo in Doctor strange makes sense since they are both New York based heroes.
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,SwagBelow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:07:30 2015 UTC,"Cap 3 will be something of a team-up movie.  I don't think they should ever make a film called like, ""Iron Man and Spider-man"" but Iron Man can certainly feature in a good Spider-man story."
marvelstudios,3dc7vu,BAIIPlus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:41:47 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I don't think Hulk can carry a movie on his own, and since the distribution rights are with Universal, I'd love Iron Man 4 to be a Hulk team-up."

marvelstudios,3dce85,dvaibhavd,9,Wed Jul 15 04:19:27 2015 UTC,"A recent post by /u/rhodetolove posed a similar question with some examples of other videos. You'll notice that the Stark Expo videos point to http://www.starkexpo2010.com/ (which is no longer available) and a Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/StarkExpo (with its last post in January 2014).  Guardians of the Galaxy had The Galaxy Getaways. There was a very nicely done website (which is now just an image), http://www.thegalaxygetaways.com/. The site included some videos, if I remember correctly, including this one. (This site has a few images of the original page).  My opinion is that real time content, specifically in-universe websites, twitter accounts, Facebook profiles, G+ pages, etc. are a very bad idea when it comes to transmedia storytelling. If such things as profiles and websites are considered canon, here are some traps that I have seen many shows, books, and other forms of storytelling fall into.   The sites usually seem pretty cool and fun at the time, but the websites almost always go down and the Twitter accounts and Facebook pages stop being updated frequently. If you cannot access the content even a year outside of the release of the site/movie, how are you ever supposed to consume all of the content unless you were there at the time? As it stands now, you cannot access the Stark Expo site or The Galaxy Getaways site, and therefore will never be able to consume those pieces of the MCU. Putting out content in real time is nice if it matches perfectly with the current canonical timeline. However, what you will often see with such material is, for example, a blog post dated July 15, 2015, for an event that happened on the show or in the movie outside of the July 2015 time frame. The WHiH videos and accounts seem to be pointing at July 17 as the date the Lang is released from prison, tying into both the story from the film and the release date of the movie. However, we know WHiH has been around for a while now covering various MCU stories. Looking at it from an in-universe perspective, did WHiH seriously only start using Twitter in July of 2015? Does this massive news company seriously only tweet every few days? Looking at these accounts, if they are to be taken as canon, one question that I wonder is: Who is writing this content? Did Feige and the rest all sign off on this and take it into account when writing the other canonical content? Something like the Darren Cross/WIRED Insider interview or any of the Christine Everhart bits are obviously shot specifically for this promotion, and I think that for that reason alone, they should probably be considered a part of the overall MCU canon. However, a spliced together montage of space shots for The Galaxy Getaways like in the video above or the Stark Expo videos with stock images and a voice over may not be shot specifically for the MCU, and so I think their canonicity may come into question. With so many forms of storytelling, content often becomes muddled. If you wanted to start consuming the entire MCU story for the first time starting tomorrow, where would you go to find an official list of everything you needed to watch and read? Would you need to play a particular video game in order to not miss out on an important storyline? Would you need to read a junior novelization to find out one of the character's names from The Incredible Hulk? The absolute biggest problem I have with transmedia storytelling is that there is so very rarely an official list put out by the official source (say in this case Marvel) of what is considered actual canon. Instead, fans are left wondering what to include in their consumption of the story. Storytelling with online profiles in an already established universe borders on breaking the fourth wall. How am I getting a tweet from WHiH about the Avengers or Scott Lang's release and absolutely no one else is covering it? Why haven't I head anything else about The Galaxy Getaways for space travel and vacation on the news?   I hope that if you read down this far, and you are someone who in any fashion will try your hand at transmedia storytelling in the future, that you a) constantly release an official list of all of the content that your story is told across, and b) steer clear from mixing real world devices such as social media accounts to tell your story."
marvelstudios,3dce85,mcucanon,2,Wed Jul 15 06:01:20 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate such a well thought out post, and I agree with most of your points, but I do have to disagree with the last bolded point.  I love it when they use real-world stuff.  It makes me feel like I am a part of the MCU.  They've done this since Iron Man 1.  Christine Everheart was with Cosmo.  Stan Lee was confused with Hef and Larry King, etc.   I don't feel it pulls me out at all if CNN isn't reporting Sokovia.  And Galaxy Getaways, I think was an intergalactic vacation destination, so you would only see it advertised in Kree space.   But, as it happens, I do have some involvement with transmedia in my job.  Nothing this high profile, but good feedback I will keep in mind for the future."

marvelstudios,3d9mlk,5aucy,64,Tue Jul 14 16:05:42 2015 UTC,"There are some really good mentions in this, but some wonky ones too.  Hemsworth and Pratt absolutely deserve to be high.  They went from being one unknown and one (mostly) TV comedy fatguy to being two Movie Stars and leading men.  Bautista deserves to be here, he had roles before but GotG caused his stock to surge.  Being in Spectre is colossal, and I really expect more work for him.  Hayley Atwell also deserves to be on here, she not only has her own Marvel show but she's getting some solid projects in.  Some names on here though are real head scratchers.  Stanley Tucci?  He's had a long and respected career, Cap didn't really boost anything.  Idris Elba was a star on the rise at the time, but he wasn't helped by Thor as much as he was helped by a steadily growing body of work.  And honestly, how the hell did RDJ or Tom Hiddleston not get on the list?  Downey staged a colossal comeback with Iron Man, and Tom Hiddleston was an unknown who is now involved in a number of high profile projects."
marvelstudios,3d9mlk,CaptainOtter407,7,Tue Jul 14 16:30:45 2015 UTC,"I think the point with RDJ was that he's the one people focus on, but there's a lot of people that aren't called out as often (I think it says something to that effect in the opening paragraph or two).  I actually really liked the Stanley Tucci one.  It calls out his pre-marvel talent and success, but his IMDB is crazy.  He has a long and successful career, but once he hits Marvel, he's almost exclusively in blockbuster/franchise films."
marvelstudios,3d9mlk,CaptainOtter407,11,Tue Jul 14 16:33:54 2015 UTC,"Good point on RDJ, I stand corrected.  I wouldn't say all the blockbusters Tucci has done have been because of Marvel though.  I don't think other studios are basing their decision to hire him after 10 minutes of screen time in Cap TFA.  I'd say he earned a lot more credit in something like earning an Academy Award nomination for The Lovely Bones.  Or even by appearing in something like the Hunger Games, which had a much bigger audience.  Let me put it this way, if you ask an average movie goer what they know Stanley Tucci from, what would they say they've seen him in?  Is Captain America in the top 3 or so of those movies?  I'd really wager it wouldn't be."
marvelstudios,3d9mlk,eiggam,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:57:20 2015 UTC,"Stanley Tucci   Most people I know would probably recognize him as the shiny teeth MC of Hunger Games.

Chris Pratt - (relatively) unknown to wet day dream of men around the world. Dave Bautista - former wrestler becomes respectable actor Hayley Atwell - Only known in Britain for smaller roles. Tom Hiddleston - unknown to wet day dream of women around the world. Chris Evans - went from ""that douche who was johnny storm and played jocks"" to ""LITERALLY THE PERFECT AND ONLY CHOICE TO PLAY CAPTAIN AMERICA"".   Potentials:   Sebastian Stan - Was in Gossip Girl mostly, not much else. Though he hasn't seen much from the MCU yet, I think after Civil War this could change drastically. Paul Bettany - Seriously, what other movies has this dude been in lately? Feige could have honestly saved his career. Elizabeth Olsen - Comes from a famous family, and was in more indie roles, but MCU could bring her into mega stardom.   I'm sorry, but Idris Elba, Kate Mara, and Stanley Tucci are all bullshit. Their success has nothing to do with the MCU. Jaimie Alexander and Karen Gillian aren't even THAT famous, especially not from just the MCU. Gillian owes her success to Doctor Who, not GotG where no casual viewer is going to recognize her."

He flushed his career down the toilet with habitual drug use since he was like 7 and did time in jail from time to time (Prison). He needed to be Iron Man much more than any of us would have wanted him to be. He's just the right kind of asshole to do IM justice. I'm hoping he becomes more of a dick in Civil War, keeping in line with the comic making him a villain."

marvelstudios,3ddd1c,CodexCracker,4,Wed Jul 15 11:35:55 2015 UTC,Kang is a far future descendent of Reed Richards. So it's not that odd.
marvelstudios,3ddd1c,subism,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:19:35 2015 UTC,So the rights deal makes him an extension of Doom and Richards? I came here to ask about the Kang thing he's probably my favorite villian.
marvelstudios,3ddd1c,dayungbenny,2,Wed Jul 15 16:33:34 2015 UTC,"and his first appearance was technically in fantastic 4 comics  ""As Rama-Tut: Fantastic Four #19 (Oct. 1963)"""
marvelstudios,3ddd1c,Honestfellow2449,3,Wed Jul 15 17:24:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I love all of the Rama-tut/Kang/Immortus nonsense. The FF annual where Tut saves Doom from space is epic. Plus, even in his first appearance as Kang in Avengers I am pretty sure that he mentions being inspired by a distant relation to Dr. Doom.   As Kang and Immortus though I feel like he is generally more of an Avengers villian and I really love their showdowns throughout the years from the old silver age stuff to the newer stuff.   But, as I was typing this I realize while I prefer Disney-Marvel to Fox, Fox would probably be a lot more well equipped to handle Kang as a character with all of the time travel since they seem more comfortable with these kind of plots what with DoFP and the dimensional travel in the coming FF movie. I think the overly complicated nature of all the time travel and explaining things would probably scare disney away."
marvelstudios,3ddd1c,dayungbenny,-1,Wed Jul 15 17:48:08 2015 UTC,"You do realise with the Time Stone being introduced soon, Time travel is inevitable right? Also Feige has stated that Doctor Strange with explore the travel to multiple alternate dimensions. So I don't see where you got the idea of ""Disney"" (despite them having nothing to do with creative decisions) being scared of these ideas."
marvelstudios,3ddd1c,dayungbenny,-2,Wed Jul 15 19:40:48 2015 UTC,"You are a fucking idiot if you think Disney has nothing to do with creative decisions   ""Yeah you represent quite possibly the most profitable part of our entire operation but go ahead and just do you""   Really, if you want to get pedantic, Marvel and Disney are the same thing, every employee of Marvel is an employee of Disney. Yes, Feige is a disney employee.  Not sure why you are getting so defensive like I shit on Disney-marvel, I specifically stated that I prefer their films.   Sure the time stone is coming but I can guarantee that they will not get too in depth with divergent timelines making things as confusing as they can get in comics. They are aiming at a wide market, and people are turned off by things that are confusing. So we might see someone go back in time 10 minutes and do things different, or send heroes to the distant past or future, but I doubt these little scenes will have any greater consequences since they are caused by the time gem, and after stopping Thanos could immediately be put back to how they were before."
marvelstudios,3ddd1c,dayungbenny,-1,Wed Jul 15 19:52:02 2015 UTC,"Wow someone took my comment a bit too personally. I guess I should just take your ""guarantee"" sense everything is so predictable.

marvelstudios,3ddd1c,subism,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:49:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's ever been confirmed but as you say the comics they've appeared in outside their own are mainly x-related plus they're all mutants, a term which Fox owns so their backstories would have to be dramatically changed if they were used. They're borderline and since they're not that major characters or fan favorites I doubt Marvel would be willing to risk it."

marvelstudios,3ddd1c,UmbrusNightshade,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:56:23 2015 UTC,"I believe I had read previously that Alpha Flight was owned by Fox as part of the X-Men deal but I don't recall where I saw that.  Also Department H was mentioned in X2 in Striker's files: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X2_(film)  That said, keep in mind: Fox does not own the television rights to the X-Men properties. Marvel does but they are limited from using them due to potential brand confusion with the X-Men films. This is all known from the Mutant X, lawsuit from years back.  It's possible that it's in enough of a gray area that they felt safe mentioning Department H on the show but it's unlikely we'll see things go much further than that."
marvelstudios,3ddd1c,UNITBlackArchive,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"I think it might be a case where Marvel may own the group itself but I have to think FOX probably owns most of the actual members. So, like, Marvel might own Department H and possibly even ""Alpha Flight"" itself, but I'm going to doubt they own any of the mutants that are on the team and if they do they'd have to make them Inhumans or something like what they did with the Twins."
marvelstudios,3ddd1c,MCUFANzzz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:06:15 2015 UTC,Alpha Flight are mutants are they not? If so then FOX owns them. The reason that we got the name drop was more for fan service than anything else. And Kang is a descendant of Reed and Susan (and Doom I believe as well) so that is the likely answer to why he is part of FOX's rights rather than Marvel's.
marvelstudios,3ddd1c,ksaid1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:14:19 2015 UTC,"Rights are a funny thing.  When the Seigel family was suing DC for the rights to Superman, the rights included Supergirl, Superboy, Steel and the Legion of Super Heroes.   Why the LSH?  They were started based on Superman's legend, they first appeared in a Superman book and for a long time it was Superboy and the LSH as the title for the book.   Wolverine first appeared in Hulk, once, but since that one appearance, he was an X-man, and stayed that way for decades.  He is not considered a derivative of Hulk.   Alpha Flight first appeared in an X-men comic in the early 80's in the Claremont/Byrne run.  They had several appearances there and Mac and Heather were retconned (kinda) into Wolverine's origins.  It wasn't until years later they got their own comic, but the original promo ads stated ""From the pages of the X-men!""  So, with that in mind, I would tend to think that their rights belong with the X-men.   Then Coulson name-dropped Department H in Agents of SHIELD, so I dunno.  Maybe it was OK to give a one-time name drop.  That kind of thing is usually allowed.    For example, DC's ""Shazam"" was really called Captain Marvel, but Marvel owned that name.  So the comic had to be called ""Shazam!"" or ""Powers of Shazam!"" etc.  but in the comic itself, he could be called Captain Marvel.   Similarly, when He-man and the Masters of the Universe were brought back around 2005, Mattel had lost the rights to the character ""Fisto"" because George Lucas trademarked ""Kitt Fisto"" for Star Wars.  So the toy had to be called ""Battle Fist"" but in the cartoon and the comic book, they could call him ""Fisto.""  TL;DR - Rights issues are weird"
marvelstudios,3ddd1c,subism,0,Thu Jul 16 07:21:46 2015 UTC,I think Marvel owns their rights... Fox didn't use them... and as you wrote Department H was mentioned in AoS... and Department H is a 100% Alpha Flight thing... so if they could use it then they can use the team as well...

marvelstudios,3d7r3c,MrScottyTay,7,Tue Jul 14 14:23:42 2015 UTC,"I heard that it had something to do with how difficult Ed Norton was to deal with and how many changes he demanded. There's a story floating around that he got really into The Wire while working on the movie, and demanded that there be a full scene including Omar from The Wire as a real character during the climactic battle with Abomination. The scene was shot to appease Norton, but then edited down to a three second cameo that actually ended up in the movie."
marvelstudios,3d7r3c,Lwsrocks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:29:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm remembering wrong, but I thought Marvel (or Whedon) had said that Norton wasn't a team player.

One would be called Astonishing Tales and would be similar to what you said, chronicling the adventures of a young Hank and Janet fighting Cold War era villains and teaming up with Silver Age heroes. The other one would be Journey into Mystery, which would be about a young Thor (with Jarnbjorn), Loki, Sif and Warriors Three which could include stuff like how Thor became worthy of Mjolnir or how Sif earned the respect of Asgard as its greatest warrior. I think there's a lot of unexplored territory in the past of the MCU which Marvel would be smart to utilise."

Everybody likes this shit. 2h30m movies are normal now. Whether or not that's a good thing is up to everybody to decide for themselves. For me personally, if you're going to have a film with six avengers, and introduce three more, and your final product is unanimously labeled ""a little rushed"" then you need a director's cut. Get off your high horse."

marvelstudios,3d8ubc,PlatFleece,28,Tue Jul 14 12:12:45 2015 UTC,"My guess is that Infinity War will be told across many movies - showing the battles on different fronts.  Outside the two official ""infinity war"" movies, they will stand alone on their own - but in the greater context, will allow hard core fans to see the scale of an interstellar fight such as this....  Infinity War will be teased at the end of Guardians 2 in some way - like the Guardians know they have to get to Earth to save the day in some way...perhaps they were dealing with a minion of Thanos for their main plot and at the end, they are all like - shit, he's going after Earth soon...  Infinity War will ""start"" in Thor: Ragnarok.  I imagine Thanos attacking Asgard (Ragnarok is a reference to the fall of Asgard) to get an infinity stone.  Thor will battle there and probably save Asgard but lose the infinity stone.  This will also justify why he is not fully in Inifinity War part 1.  Infinity War part 1 will be Thanos setting his eyes on Earth.  It will have a current roster of Avengers.  Missing will probably be Thor. It will probably be more Tony Stark than Iron Man.  Ant Man will probably be an Avenger post Civil War.  I expect some sort of Strange's magic/Pym Particle/Wakandan Vibranium plot device to save earth.  (I also expect it to end with some of the heroes under siege in Wakanda...)  Black Panther will be a ""Siege"" movie.  Wakanda is the city that never fell and the only way to really make it a Black Panther movie after the infinity war already started would be the make it all Wakandan...  Captain Marvel could be anything. It could be cosmic - with Carol Danvers as Captain Marvel in space, and thus connect to the Guardians as we race toward the Infinity War conclusion.  Or it could be Top Gun with a super hero...which could be cool.  Anyway - it will be the same war on a different front.  Infinity War 2 would be the culmination of all of this coming together.  Thor will return - no exposition needed, because we saw where he last was in Ragnorak.  Guardians will arrive - again, we know what they've been up to.  They'll focus on a few heroes stories throughout but will basically come down to Cap or Stark winning (and maybe doing the ultimate sacrifice).    Inhumans will be the denouement of it all - what happens after a cosmic extinction event comes to earth and the politics/repurcussions/etc all.  I dunno...  I think Agents of Shield will provide interesting back story or exposition for the nerd class really interesting in this stuff.  Netflix series will provide some exposition but seems to be more built on expansion of a broader universe and the street level stuff.  I think Strange will have a role here - especially since they casted Cumberbatch and he basically will act in any medium, not just movies.  There will be a connection, but I think they will be used to establish a post Cap/Iron Man/etc universe that they will have to do after the Infinity War (because, let's be honest, Disney/Marvel won't stop making these movies after Phase III)"

marvelstudios,3d8ubc,mancubuss,5,Wed Jul 15 01:49:59 2015 UTC,"As of right now, there are three confirmed characters: Hulk, Thor, & Captain America. Feige announced Hulk at the Phase 3 presser, Hemsworth confirmed himself and Evans in an AOU press interview for both films. With that in mind...   Mainline Avengers - We know Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Black Widow are signed for a third Avengers film, but it's unclear if they're signed for both Infinity War films. It's a pretty damn safe bet that at least Iron Man & Widow will appear in IW. Hawkeye... we'll wait to see how Civil War shakes out. Auxiliary Avengers - Vision & Scarlet Witch are pretty safe bets. Not sure about Falcon, War Machine, Maria Hill or Nick Fury. Again, we need to see how Civil War / the rest of Phase 3 shake out. New Heroes - Ant-Man and Spider-Man both seem a given. Black Panther and Captain Marvel are also probably confirmed, at least for the second film. Strange will probably play a major role, but it wouldn't surprise me if Marvel decides to save him for future storylines (like how GOTG didn't appear in Avengers 2). Guardians of the Galaxy - They will be big players, but perhaps not the whole team. Quill and Rocket are guarantees. Probably Groot as well. Unsure about Gamora/Drax/whoever the new Guardian is, we'll need to see how GOTG2 shakes out.  Inhumans - Honestly don't think the Inhumans will show up, it's too much to add to the pile. However, it wouldn't surprise me if a single Inhuman joined the roster. Perhaps Crystal, if she debuts in an earlier film? Defenders/SHIELD - Don't think any of the television heroes will appear. The film will be super dense already, and I think Marvel would like to narrow their focus to make sure each character shines. I mean, could you see Iron Fist or Jessica Jones even having a speaking role in a film this dense? Villains - Loki is probable, obviously waiting on how/if he survives Ragnarok. Winter Soldier is also possible, depending on how Civil War shakes out. It also wouldn't surprise me if Ultron appeared, buried away inside that Mind Stone. And Quicksilver may appear, as a vision to haunt Scarlet Witch. But otherwise, I think the focus will be squarely on Thanos. Hopes - Really hoping for Falcon, Yondu, Sif, & Heimdall, and a version of Wasp. I'd also love Nova, Adam Warlock, Ms. Marvel, and Squirrel Girl, but sincerely doubt they'll be in the MCU by the time Infinity War comes around. I'd also be tickled if Jon Favreau and Joss Whedon cameoed alongside Stan Lee.   MAIN ROSTER PREDICTION - Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Ant-Man, Wasp, Spider-Man, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, Star-Lord, Rocket, Groot, Crystal, Loki, Nick Fury, and Thanos.  Fuck that's a huge cast. I thought I was being conservative. No wonder they need two movies."
marvelstudios,3d8ubc,SuperCoenBros,8,Tue Jul 14 15:26:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Drax will make an appearance with the other Guardians, if only to have a face off with Thanos."
marvelstudios,3d8ubc,bogaboy,3,Tue Jul 14 18:48:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think Thanos and Drax will share a scene together in the MCU. Drax killing Thanos in the comics is so amazing because Drax was literally created to fight him, and it took decades of character development before Drax was able to fulfill his mission. Drax's entire backstory revolves around Thanos and the Eternals.  But the films have changed Drax's backstory, making him a mourning father instead of a genetic soldier. Since Thanos might not even be in GOTG2, I don't think there's enough time to establish Drax's Thanos grudge in a way that feels as satisfying in the comics.  Marvel did Ultron without Pym, the Maximoffs without Magneto, and it looks like they'll do Thanos without Adam Warlock. Drax is one of my favorite Marvel characters, but I just don't think he'll be a huge player in Infinity War."
marvelstudios,3d8ubc,SuperCoenBros,6,Tue Jul 14 19:36:12 2015 UTC,All of GotG is Drax wanting to defeat Ronan just to realize Thanos is the one he wants to defeat...
marvelstudios,3d8ubc,Caleb902,2,Tue Jul 14 20:46:06 2015 UTC,"We don't know how that's going to play out. Like I said,   Since Thanos might not even be in GOTG2, I don't think there's enough time to establish Drax's Thanos grudge in a way that feels as satisfying in the comics.   GOTG2 will be Drax's biggest film before Infinity War. And by the time IW comes around, there'll be a long line of people waiting to kick Thanos' ass. I don't think Drax gets priority over any of the Avengers."
marvelstudios,3d8ubc,SuperCoenBros,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:03:05 2015 UTC,"I remember Gunn stating something along the lines of ""our heroes might not be so hero-ish after all.""  It's very vague, but I think this will be about Drax (and Gamora, but that's another topic). Maybe he goes rogue going to the extreme, fantasizing about his revenge upon Thanos. This can set up some story between the two. Then he can have a 'change of heart' in the first IW, and save the day on the second.   I'm just reaching and speculating here, but with Marvel adapting the comics to fit the movie universe it can certainly go in either direction."

This is why I took the approach that I did...you can definitely work out narratives that tell the story of all those characters if you do it across many movies (especially if from Thor to the end of the Infinity War is like a short period of time like Phase 1)"
marvelstudios,3d8ubc,georgegsmithjr,2,Wed Jul 15 17:41:57 2015 UTC,For villains I would say Loki and Red Skull have a good shot at showing.

marvelstudios,3d8ubc,jasonhaven,3,Tue Jul 14 12:49:03 2015 UTC,"Captain Marvel will be more than a guest appearance, at least in IW2.  she will be the main star as Earth's Mightiest Hero against cosmic threats."

marvelstudios,3d8ubc,Flamma_Man,2,Tue Jul 14 20:04:27 2015 UTC,"I think that probably all of the really strong Avengers(IM, CA, Hulk, Thor, SW, Vision, WM, DS, BP, and CM, maybe Giant-Man if that ever happens) will be the ones in space that meet up with the Guardians, Spider-Man wants to join in but isn't strong enough but gets the Symbiote somehow and becomes stronger and joins the rest of the Avengers.   The other Avengers(BW, HE, Falcon, and maybe Scott Lang) will help take on some Earth threat that Thanos sent and they'll reference that there are heroes all over the world helping and possibly show the Defenders and Secret Warriors.   I'm not sure where the Inhumans would fit into this and there is a possibility anyone of these people will die before they take on Thanos but that's how I think it'll go down. I'm probably wrong."

They may as well be just as weak as the othrs if they are on the same team as hulk, vision and  Thor. stop being bias. If you want a powerhoue to team, be realistic about it at least.

On the TV side I see the Defenders as ones who will be in the film because they have been talking about including them in interviews like this with the boss of Netflix http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=42004 and I think AoS will have there own episodes talking about it if they don't get canceled or end til then."
marvelstudios,3d8ubc,SwagBelow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:24:58 2015 UTC,"All of the heroes will appear, including the Guardians. Thanks will obtain the power to end the universe, so you bet your ass that all of heroes will fight as one. I think Black Panther and Captain Marvel will also be involved despite being in between Infinity War Part 1 and 2. Black Panther is already active in Civil War, so why can't he be active in IW Part 1 with his movie being some sort of prequel origin story? I feel like Captain Marvel will be introduced in a different movie so that she can be present for Part 1 as well. If not, she'll be in Part 2 for sure."
marvelstudios,3d8ubc,Keepitstrong05,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:57:45 2015 UTC,"The most reliable rumors I've heard for a while now have been: Infinity War part 1 has relatively new Avengers lineup, the main guys we love won't be fighting for at least most of part 1. Stark will be there but I think less as Iron Man. Steve will either be dead or give up the mantle of Cap by the end of Civil War. Bucky might take his place as Cap and could be leading the new lineup. Thor will be dealing with whatever craziness happens in Ragnarok. I think Part 1 will mainly feature (give or take a few heroes) Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man, probably Wasp, Falcon, War Machine, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel and Black Widow. Part 2 will have everyone coming back together to beat Thanos. I'm not sure about Hulk. We'll see come Civil War if his whereabouts are known. If not then he might be MIA by Infinity War. I hope the Defenders might show up. I assume IW will be a huge galactic-level fight, with the main fight between the Avengers and Thanos being in space. But Thanos could send an army of sorts down to Earth and the Defenders could be taking care of business at the ground level while everyone else fights in a galactic conflict. That'd be a neat way to tie everyone together but not necessarily distract from the main movie heroes."
marvelstudios,3d8ubc,Maggie_Smith,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:32:36 2015 UTC,Almost guaranteed:  Iron Man  Black Widow  Hulk  Thor  Captain America  Scarlet Witch  Hawkeye  Ant-Man  Vision  Captain Marvel  Doctor Strange  Black Panther  Spider-Man  Maybe:  Guardians  War Machine  Falcon  Wasp  Doctor Strange/Black Panther/Captain Marvel/Spider-Man sidekicks??  Inhumans  Nick Fury/Maria Hill
marvelstudios,3d8ubc,ashtonknapp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:44:25 2015 UTC,"This just made me realize that Ragnarok will likely have some kind of tie-in to Infinity War, especially since it is the movie that immediately predates it.  Presumably, Thanos, as his Other alluded to in Avengers 1, will come to Loki for  the tesseract and in doing so bring all manner of Hel down on Asgard for it.  This could do the job of rectifying his position at the end of TDW and his failure to secure the tesseract in the Avengers.   With GotG 2 coming out 6 months prior, that chapter will probably end with the crew realizing from the utterances of a defeated minion, or the insight of Peter's father that Thanos is bound for Earth.  I firmly expect Spider-Man, Black Panther and Doctor Strange to deal with established their characters and mythos, especially the latter two but Captain Marvel will probably be less of an origin story and more in line with the on going conflict.  Because of the scale of this I really don't foresee our Defenders coming into play beyond cutaways of ""street-level"" heroes coping with the damage on Earth.  I expect to see their second(or third) seasons dealing with the fallout. edit: I already love this Daredevil but realistically a blind boxer is going to be doing damage control at the street level and not in a space suit fighting the Mad Titan.  I mean after an interstellar titan wages war on your planet, the Kingpin would find an easy foothold back into Hell's Kitchen.  As to IW:1 I am still unsure because clearly the pay off is going to be the second part.  Frankly we need to get past CW before we can begin to guess what we're going to see but likely a lot of people getting REKT.  Lastly, I FULLY expect AoS to naval gaze into the Inhuman conflict for the next several seasons to build up to that and have slight reflections of the other films.  Everything at the back end of this most recent season points that way, we'll see if I have to eat my hat soon."

Basically he can look through the Eye to locate the various stones across the universe.  I think that would leave options more open for the Infinity movies. They could jump right in with Dr. Strange having located all the stones and having a plan of attack. And then whenever Thanos completes the collection, it won't mean that the Avengers have lost the ability to warp across the universe."
marvelstudios,3d9pby,FranchiseTag,2,Tue Jul 14 19:15:45 2015 UTC,Wait I don't think I'm getting what you mean. Would it allow him to just see where the stones are or would it allow him to gather them? And in the last sentence are you saying the Eye can teleport the Avengers or Dr. Strange can?

marvelstudios,3d9pby,TripleSkeet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:44:39 2015 UTC,"I have a gut feeling the eye is a stone. It makes too much sense even though it would differ from the comics significantly.  I guess my reasoning is based on what Marvel did with Vision and the Mind Stone. He should have had the solar gem, but using the stone instead created a ton of connective tissue in the MCU and essentially laid the ground for IW.  I also think it makes more sense to use it in Dr. Strange as Thor already introduced the Aether, GOTG the power stone, and CA/Avengers the mind and tesseract. I don't see how the time/soul stone fits in with black panther, spiderman, or CW. Maybe Captain Marvel, but there's still one more introduce. I just think it makes too much sense to have one in Strange, even if it is the eye."
marvelstudios,3d9pby,hulksmash86,-1,Wed Jul 15 13:47:11 2015 UTC,"the theory I'm going with is Starlords dad brought it to earth when he was banging Miss Quill, I'm also going with the idea that its the soul gem, best one to explain ""magic"" in my mind, if they go that route with it, could easily be the eye of agamotto.  also banking on Starlords dad to be Adam Warlock."

Too bad Hank Pym is not as unimportant or niche as he thought, because clearly he plays an important part when it comes to Avengers lore.  Marvel should have pushed for Ant-man and Wasp before the Avengers and Wright should have moved quickly if he wanted control over the character in relation to the universe."

Knowing Marvel's history as far back as IM2 up to and including the meddling they did with AoU it wouldn't be much of a surprise if they ruined an excellent story to fit their family-friendly formula.

marvelstudios,3d8cru,RansomHostage,13,Tue Jul 14 12:47:59 2015 UTC,"Stuckmann has become my favorite movie reviewer on YouTube, replacing Jeremy Jahns."
marvelstudios,3d8cru,that_guy2010,7,Tue Jul 14 14:20:44 2015 UTC,Come on guys.  What about Mr Sunday Movies?
marvelstudios,3d8cru,ERagingTyrant,-4,Tue Jul 14 16:23:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I trust Mr. Sunday above all. Have never watched Stuckmann before, and I'll watch this one and give him a chance, but dude has 2 strikes against him in my book  1 - when his channel comes up as recommended on YouTube, it's just a picture of him with the douche-iest expression on his face. Like, I cannot believe a normal, cool human being would choose that picture.  2- He was a diva-ish asshole on the Comic Con Movie Fights episode.  But like I said, I'll try and give this video a fair shake.  edit: Watched it. Eh, pretty unremarkable."
marvelstudios,3d8cru,Tom-ocil,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:46:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, fuck that guy for doing his job! /s/"
marvelstudios,3d8cru,RavensTelltaleHeart,-1,Wed Jul 15 01:44:02 2015 UTC,What?
marvelstudios,3d8cru,Tom-ocil,3,Wed Jul 15 02:11:24 2015 UTC,Curious; any reason for Stuckmann over Jeremy?
marvelstudios,3d8cru,BassFight,7,Tue Jul 14 15:30:05 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I still really like Jeremy. It just feels to me like Stuckmann knows more about the craft of filmmaking and can provide deeper insight into the films than Jeremy. Look up some of Stuckmann's 'Explained' videos. He knows his stuff."
marvelstudios,3d8cru,that_guy2010,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:29:57 2015 UTC,"Hm, I can see that. I guess I still prefer the style of Jeremy's vids. Content aside, I find them more enjoyable to watch than Stuckmann. I'll put the explenation vids on my watchlist, thanks for elaborating."
marvelstudios,3d8cru,BassFight,2,Tue Jul 14 21:37:34 2015 UTC,"Again, don't get me wrong, Jeremy is still really good. I just prefer Stuckmann.  The explanation videos are really good, but they do spoil the movies. So don't watch unless you've seen it, or don't mind spoilers."
marvelstudios,3d8cru,that_guy2010,7,Tue Jul 14 21:43:37 2015 UTC,"There's still such a weird discrepancy between the YouTube reviewers that I've seen (Stuckmann, SchmoesKnows) and the general review consensus (RT 70%, MC 66%). Is it a really targeted comic book/Marvel movie for fans or just residual weirdness from Wright's departure?"
marvelstudios,3d8cru,ArmandTanzarianMusic,6,Tue Jul 14 09:07:52 2015 UTC,"I think the reviewers are just griped about the Edgar right exit.  I have yet to read a negative review (or any review really, mind I haven't read many) that didn't bring up the Edgar Wright thing.  Basically they are reviewing it as an Edgar Wright movie, then saying it wasn't Edgar Wright-y enough."
marvelstudios,3d8cru,ERagingTyrant,3,Tue Jul 14 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"You're not going to read any review of this movie that doesn't bring up the fact that it lost an incredibly talented, famous director relatively late into production. You just aren't. That's not necessarily bitching, it's an important detail."
marvelstudios,3d8cru,Tom-ocil,7,Tue Jul 14 16:54:57 2015 UTC,"It isn't relevant to reviewing a movie that he did not direct.  I just feel like no one is reviewing the movie that was made because they are busy comparing it to a movie that wasn't made.  I mean it's interesting gossip to talk about, but I feel like the critics are all ""We got your back Edgar.""  Of course, I haven't seen the movie yet so maybe I'll agree with them."
marvelstudios,3d8cru,ERagingTyrant,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:54:37 2015 UTC,"It isn't relevant to reviewing a movie that he did not direct.    If an incredibly talented, unique director drops out of a movie pretty late into production and then the end result is a movie that you feel is merely average, then yes, it is worth mentioning.  It's not like these reviews are 'Well, the movie opens with XYZ, and Edgar Wright wouldn't have done that, so I didn't like it.' They're reviewing the movie on its own terms and, for the most part, it isn't blowing them away and they can't help but wonder what the movie could have been."
marvelstudios,3d8cru,Tom-ocil,2,Tue Jul 14 18:09:01 2015 UTC,"I have no sympathy for Edgar Wright. He had a very long time to get his film done and sat on his laurels and/or did other stuff instead of focusing on this. Therefore, he is at fault in my opinion, not Marvel. And I completely agree that it unprofessional to review a film and then give it negative marks because it wasn't ""just like"" the original director would have done."
marvelstudios,3d8cru,UmbrusNightshade,2,Tue Jul 14 23:55:53 2015 UTC,"Most YT reviews bring up that their complaints were basically this: what we could've gotten if Wright stayed on, Yellow Jacket being underdeveloped, and a slight criticism of the film being a bit....average"
marvelstudios,3d8cru,JNPR1996,5,Tue Jul 14 16:51:40 2015 UTC,"Stuckmann has been my favorite reviewer for years now. He does some really great videos talking about what's wrong with certain genres in the movie industry (his video on the problems with action movies nowadays is spectacular).   I like the way he talks about the movies. He talks about the technicalities in a non douchey way and he's just very very honest. He's not afraid to express when he's fanboying or disappointed. There are a lot of movies that people wanted him to like but he didn't and vice versa.   His interests in movies is really similar to mine. When he reviewed fast five, I was surprised. He talked about how he wasn't going to knock off points from the movie just because it was a mindless action movie. He liked how it was filmed, he had a great time seeing it because he turned his brain off and looked over the ridiculousness of it and ended up giving it a high score which was exactly how I felt about it."
marvelstudios,3d8cru,alijamzz,3,Tue Jul 14 15:38:23 2015 UTC,"Since we're talking about Youtube movie reviewers here, what's everyone's opinion on John Campea?"
marvelstudios,3d8cru,MonasDarling,4,Tue Jul 14 19:57:45 2015 UTC,He's too pompous to me to take fully seriously.
marvelstudios,3d8cru,prophetofgreed,2,Tue Jul 14 20:58:13 2015 UTC,He's alright.
marvelstudios,3d8cru,Tom-ocil,2,Tue Jul 14 20:08:54 2015 UTC,Better than most. But far from the best.
marvelstudios,3d8cru,HowieGaming,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:44:49 2015 UTC,"He's a great hype-man, and knows a lot more about the industry than the majority of youtube critics. I like him a lot even if I happen to disagree with him a whole lot too."
marvelstudios,3d8cru,Just_shut_up_bro,2,Wed Jul 15 01:11:33 2015 UTC,"Glad he feels the 3D adds something, was wondering whether or not it'd be worth it."
marvelstudios,3d8q2w,abraksis747,24,Tue Jul 14 11:22:18 2015 UTC,"Post-cave Tony would at least provide for them financially but I don't know about trying to be involved in their lives. Pre-cave Tony might have tried to get out of it, not to save the money but to avoid acknowledging responsibility."
marvelstudios,3d8q2w,shhhhquiet,19,Tue Jul 14 11:31:44 2015 UTC,The best part of this joke is Tony's reaction when she tells him he's thirteen.
marvelstudios,3d8q2w,rooney815,15,Tue Jul 14 13:29:12 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this a lot. I feel like prior to Iron Man 1 he would've taken the Steve Jobs approach, to put it lightly. But nowadays? He might acknowledge them, he might not, but regardless he would probably provide for them behind their backs.   Inb4 ""you must be Tony Stark's bastard"" jokes."
marvelstudios,3d8q2w,AlleyOopToym,11,Tue Jul 14 14:13:09 2015 UTC,Does that make them a snow since hes a Stark? :P

marvelstudios,3d8q2w,CrackedOzy,14,Thu Jul 16 04:21:47 2015 UTC,"I would suspect that Tony was the kind of guy who, no matter how drunk he was, would be smart and wear protection."
marvelstudios,3d8q2w,mustachio89,4,Tue Jul 14 11:43:01 2015 UTC,"It depends. Does Tony practice safe sex?  This isn't Game of Thrones, he's not that type of Stark, condoms and pills do exist. :P You can be a womanizer who sleeps around and not have any illigitiment children as long as you take precaution. Yeah, sometimes precaution fails but it's not a definite thing. And I hope for Tony's sake he covers up just because of STIs.  The only way I could see it happening is if Tony made a lapse of judgement while drunk. Ether way, I highly doubt we'll see an Iron Man movie where Tony meets his twenty bastard kids. :P  I'd be more worried for Star-Lord. We know aliens and humans can produce children together. At least Stark sleeps with human women but who knows how those alien girls that Peter sleeps with conceive. Maybe it's just by skin contact (okay, dumb but I have Futurama on the brain)? Stark might have kids all over the nation but Quill might have kids all over the Galaxy."

marvelstudios,3dbile,HonestPelvis,9,Wed Jul 15 00:04:00 2015 UTC,Kraven. As flamboyant and depressing as he's ever been all at once.
marvelstudios,3dbile,RedBarrel,2,Wed Jul 15 00:49:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know too much about Kraven from the comics, but I hope he will be something like he is portrayed in the Amazing Spider-man 2 game. At first he was an ally, but then it turned out that he was actually studying his strengths and learning how to beat Spider-man, the most dangerous game style."
marvelstudios,3dbile,FuckMeRunning5648,5,Wed Jul 15 03:19:38 2015 UTC,I mostly want to see Spidey characters in other properties. I think it would be awesome to see one of his baddies on Agents of Shield or one of the Netflix series.
marvelstudios,3dbile,rooney815,3,Wed Jul 15 00:11:09 2015 UTC,"Well, kingpin.. isn't he one of spidey's villains in the comics"

marvelstudios,3dbile,JuanRiveara,3,Wed Jul 15 00:51:35 2015 UTC,Yeah haha
marvelstudios,3dbile,clknuts,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:54:32 2015 UTC,true but even that was before they got spidey rights
marvelstudios,3dbile,rooney815,3,Wed Jul 15 00:54:26 2015 UTC,"Mysterio, Kraven the Hunter, Chameleon (only if he and Mysterio are a bank robbing team in the 1st film; two low level villains who ""frame"" the upstart Spider-Man for robberies; could also start tying in Chameleon and Kraven for a later film), Vulture (tied to Falcon's tech and possibly setting him up to be a Falcon AND Spider-Man villain; also, I'd like to see an older man play him but make him more a dignified ""elder"" type than a ""crotchety old man"" type), Norman Osborn first followed down the line with Green Goblin (make Norman more of a human villain like he is in Dark Reign and then follow up with him going through some kind of psychosis or drugs or whatever and thus is born Green Goblin; also I would like to see Harry be either a good guy for once or die off because I am tired of seeing him as Green Goblin or Hobgoblin), Venom (with ""evil"" Eddie Brock first followed perhaps down the line with good or antihero ... preferably antihero ... Flash Thompson), I'd say Carnage but that is likely to never happen unless the character showed up on a Netflix show, Dr. Octopus (extremely down the line; I would like a version where the octopus arms are more mechanical but ""real life octupus"" like rather than the claw-machine type comic book version ... there is a plausible way to do this), and Black Cat  I would also like to see a film where Daredevil and or Punisher are up against Spidey.   Here's some maybes: The Prowler, Jack'o'Lantern (a version that is linked to Mysterio and maybe to Hobgoblin or Green Goblin), Shocker (but done much better than the way that Electro was handled), Rhino (way down the line ... basically an Iron Man version of the big one from ASM2 ... a bit more down to earth than that stupid huge machine suit), Sin Eater, Carrion (as an Inhuman and with a clean back story), Morlun (way down the line; I'd like to see him as the thing that brings Peter's and Miles' stories together; basically make the ""origin"" of Miles have something to do with Morlun and Peter), Morbius (if they do indeed bring Blade into the MCU), Scorpion (I think he would be cool to be either tied to the Venom symbiote or as an Iron Man type suit; could have Scorpion and Rhino in the same film), Alistair Smythe and the Spider Slayers"
marvelstudios,3dbile,UmbrusNightshade,2,Wed Jul 15 01:00:35 2015 UTC,Shocker (but done much better than the way that Electro was handled)   You do realize Shocker and Electro don't have similar powers at all.
marvelstudios,3dbile,JuanRiveara,2,Wed Jul 15 01:36:18 2015 UTC,"Yes I know. I more meant I want them to not make Shocker a stereotype or trope like they did with Electro and also to not screw up his appearance completely. I hated that Electro was this nerdy, wimp (and not really even a believable version of that). And I hated the bright blue glowing neon-sign look they gave him. I'm hoping they do a better job at not ruining Shocker than they did Electro."
marvelstudios,3dbile,UmbrusNightshade,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:43:54 2015 UTC,Then you can say that about any of his villains.
marvelstudios,3dbile,JuanRiveara,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:49:01 2015 UTC,The blue glowing full electricity shocker was taken from the ultimate version of him as well as using electro closer to his power peak when he was literally able to become an electric current. I didnt like his origin as a nerdy science guy (so typical) but his powers i thought they did alright.
marvelstudios,3dbile,bucketofsteam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:58:03 2015 UTC,"I've never read Ultimate stuff. The more people tell me about it the dumber that universe sounds. I thought they did his powers decent enough and Jamie Fox was great as a scary and psychotic villain (once he got to that point), but I just hated his appearance. To me it was too ""comic booky"". I think they need to find a happy medium between straight up comic book visuals and real world visuals."

marvelstudios,3dbile,UmbrusNightshade,0,Wed Jul 15 01:39:20 2015 UTC,"Vulture (tied to Falcon's tech and possibly setting him up to be a Falcon AND Spider-Man villain; also, I'd like to see an older man play him but make him more a dignified ""elder"" type than a ""crotchety old man"" type)   James Cromwell would make a fabulous Vulture."
marvelstudios,3dbile,thatdeductivefellow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:33:29 2015 UTC,I agree. I hadn't thought of him. I personally like Terry O'Quinn or Bryan Cranston.

Venom  Carnage  Chameleon (feel like he works as a bridge to bigger MCU with his connections to hydra and shield)  Alistair Smyth (not the super spider slayer though)  Kraven could be cool but don't see him carrying a movie either but he would work in a supporting role with chameleon.  Proto/Green/Hob Goblin ( any of these but I want some mystery to it as to who is behind the mask, I feel like that should be a major plot point in a goblin movie)  Doc Ock"

marvelstudios,3d4x87,RustyNoodle,13,Mon Jul 13 18:41:43 2015 UTC,Thor's Day Mourning
marvelstudios,3d4x87,Dissidence802,7,Mon Jul 13 21:57:54 2015 UTC,Didn't see that coming.
marvelstudios,3d4x87,Keepitstrong05,10,Mon Jul 13 19:02:49 2015 UTC,That is where the name for the day comes from.  In fact most of the days are named for Norse Gods. Tuesday = Tyr's day.  Wednesday = (W)Oden's day. Friday = Freya's day.
marvelstudios,3d4x87,Zero00430,2,Tue Jul 14 00:00:39 2015 UTC,"And then in Romance languages, those days are named for the Roman equivalents / planets! Spanish: martes (Mars), miercoles (Mercury), jueves (Jupiter), viernes (Venus).  I'm still holding out hope that they use the fact that Thursday is Thor's Day in the films somewhere, as a one-liner or something. Or even just in marketing, for a Thursday release."
marvelstudios,3d4x87,bobertf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:36:57 2015 UTC,"It all meshes, since the Norse Gods all had planets associated with them.   I agree about the Thor's day thing.  I was disappointed when they didn't release it b on a Thursday."
marvelstudios,3d4x87,Zero00430,2,Tue Jul 14 15:26:17 2015 UTC,"Cool, I didn't realize that about the planets. So Jupiter is Planet Thor? Forget Planet Hulk!"

marvelstudios,3d4x87,Zero00430,2,Tue Jul 14 16:05:14 2015 UTC,Sounds like a retcon waiting to happen...
marvelstudios,3d4x87,bobertf,7,Tue Jul 14 16:11:47 2015 UTC,Kinda sad really.
marvelstudios,3d4x87,Pokevenger,43,Mon Jul 13 18:37:37 2015 UTC,"My favourite bit of trivia is that 'Sputnik' was actually a shutdown code used on the Winter Soldier. I'm sure we can't read too much into it, but it's a good choice!  Edit: You could always ask James Gunn on his FB why he chose 'Full Tilt', OP! He does AMAs pretty often and replies to a lot of people."
marvelstudios,3d4x87,threesquares,15,Mon Jul 13 15:47:38 2015 UTC,Sputnick was the world's first artificial satellite. I imagine it might have to do with the program Tony is trying to implement. Maybe he wants to implement something similar to the robotic policing systems we saw in Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron.
marvelstudios,3d4x87,TheMightySwami,9,Mon Jul 13 16:11:16 2015 UTC,"I feel it is much more likely that it is referring to Sputnick as the start of the space race. You know, that conflict between two major powers."

marvelstudios,3d4x87,TheMightySwami,31,Tue Jul 14 02:44:36 2015 UTC,Full Tilt is more than likely a reference to pinball which would be appropriate for GotG and the era the soundtrack is from.
marvelstudios,3d4x87,FinsternIRL,8,Mon Jul 13 17:03:31 2015 UTC,Pinball is what I originally thought but I didn't find a good enough reason to connect the two. I suppose that could work!
marvelstudios,3d4x87,teerev,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:23:35 2015 UTC,"it could be a reference to poker and Full Tilt poker.  as in they are on tilt the whole film, like when you take a bad beat at the poker table and go on tilt."

marvelstudios,3d4x87,threesquares,29,Tue Jul 14 20:27:43 2015 UTC,"Rasputin I'm assuming refers to Vanko's links to Howard Stark as his advisor.   Manhattan I'm not certain about!  Frostbite - Captain America coming out of the ice.   Group Hug - all of the Avengers coming together as allies/friends.  Caged Heat - Extremis being under the skin.  Thursday Mourning - Thursday comes from the Norse 'Thors Day', and Mourning is probably in reference to the characters who die.   Freezer Burn - attacks from the Winter Soldier.   After party - 'after' Avengers or Ultron, I suppose, whichever way you look at it.   Big foot - teeny tiny Ant Man.  Bluff - as in Blind Man's Bluff.  Ringside - could be in reference to DD vs the Punisher maybe?"
marvelstudios,3d4x87,Skullman1392,28,Mon Jul 13 23:29:01 2015 UTC,"I'd say Manhattan is definitely in reference the Manhattan Project, because the first nuclear detonation took place in New Mexico; a more direct connection between the Manhattan Project and the events of Thor comes from Nick Fury in the Avengers: ""Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet that had a grudge match that leveled a small town.""  Also, Violet for JJ would refer to the Purple Man!  *Ninja formatting edits"
marvelstudios,3d4x87,threesquares,3,Mon Jul 13 16:28:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, of course! I'd guessed that it maybe referred to the Project, but I couldn't think how it all connected. Good call on the Purple Man, too - I'd completely forgotten about that."
marvelstudios,3d4x87,level1gamer,8,Mon Jul 13 16:57:50 2015 UTC,Afterparty probably refers to the party scene in Age of Ultron.
marvelstudios,3d4x87,kaimason1,14,Mon Jul 13 17:52:18 2015 UTC,"See, I thought it would refer to Ultron being like a continuation of IM3's House Party Protocol."

marvelstudios,3d4x87,JuTeKa,2,Mon Jul 13 17:13:34 2015 UTC,I would guess that Ringside is somekind of reference to how DD's father was a boxer
marvelstudios,3d4x87,drelos,3,Wed Jul 15 00:07:53 2015 UTC,And where Daredevil currently trains almost every night.
marvelstudios,3d4x87,jibbyjam1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:01:11 2015 UTC,I think bluff is more a reference to Daredevil being able to tell when someone is lying.

marvelstudios,3d4x87,SubhasTheJanitor,10,Tue Jul 14 03:07:01 2015 UTC,Working titles are used as code names during production and filming. This is especially helpful when filming on location or out in public where onlookers and passersby may distract work.

Those chairs have logos printed onto them, don't they? Also, actors are easily recognizable if they're famous enough."
marvelstudios,3d4x87,Mongooo,8,Mon Jul 13 16:03:24 2015 UTC,"It's mainly used when the LLC's issue a filming notice. I remember when The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was being filmed, residents in a suburban area were given a letter stating a Columbia film titled ""London Calling"" was going to be filmed on one of the streets. Of course once they had seen Andrew Garfield the gig was up. But if residents were expecting something boring from a title like that, then filming generally would have flown under the radar. If you haven't been to an on-location set they pretty much have a pretty wide perimeter in place depending on the area. The chairs and such are a lot closer to the set itself. The idea is to disguise the film, not advertise it.   The gig is usually up when the actors are seen; like when Chris Evans was stunting on a truck in an open overpass in South Korea, but the initial public commotion is mitigated by a false title.   If they had just advertised and said, ""By the way we're filming the Avengers right here at this time at this location,"" in advanced, then word could have gotten out and the set would be stormed--delaying work. If people go on about their daily lives and just so happen to see a film set, by the time word got out to the rest of the world they would already be close to wrapping up."

My thoughts are when the superhero craze dies down and people spend less money on superhero movies they'll re-release a lot of the marvel movies with extra scenes added as like a remastered edition. Those will probably be some of the deleted scenes.  Extended cut may have been the better words.

marvelstudios,3d5k8o,xxbeast15,2,Mon Jul 13 20:44:24 2015 UTC,"Doubt it. They're putting what I assume to be most, if not all, of the cut material on the disc as deleted scenes. To simply insert them back into the movie isn't a huge draw, and will undoubtedly have been done by fans 5 minutes after the Blu-Ray was released."
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,Tom-ocil,6,Tue Jul 14 00:12:34 2015 UTC,"Well there is the draw back that some scenes might not be fully complete, like green screen not filled in, cgi non existant or uncomplete, audio not completed etc... it has been known to happen."

He puts out the movie he wants to put out the first time. Even if he had to remove a few things he wanted, he wouldn't release it if he wasn't happy with it as-is.... Basically, he wants what comes out the first time to be the ""Director's Cut""."
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,jerslan,5,Mon Jul 13 23:08:09 2015 UTC,"From what it sounds like, he wanted to put out a three and a half hour movie, and you simply can't market that to a large audience."

It's always much longer and it's never intended for release.  I think a misunderstanding over that is where most of the talk of an AoU Director's Cut came from in the first place."
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,randomsnark,4,Tue Jul 14 11:16:41 2015 UTC,I don't think he wanted to actually release that cut. I think he just knew that wasn't viable and that some things he wanted to do needed to be cut for the sake of the movie.

marvelstudios,3d5k8o,jerslan,12,Tue Jul 14 20:35:16 2015 UTC,"It seems, though, like Whedon is saying no to a directors cut solely from the perspective of an artist (understandably so). All he's saying is that this isn't some Blade Runner-esque situation where there's some version of the movie floating around out there 'the way it was supposed to be'.  He more or less made the movie he wanted to make and it satisfied with the way it turned out. I don't think that necessarily shuts the door on an extended version, it just means he views the version we all saw as a complete work."
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,Tom-ocil,2,Mon Jul 13 20:16:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I hope people realize the distinction between ""Director's Cut"" (artist's personal vision) and ""Extended Edition"" (provides the fuller picture but may have stuff the director didn't want or care about)."
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,AlleyOopToym,45,Tue Jul 14 11:50:04 2015 UTC,I think it's fine. In retrospect a big part of what didn't work for me was too much humor. Ultron wasn't scary. The humor took the very serious situation they were all in and made it seem unimportant.
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,Elementium,17,Mon Jul 13 18:34:44 2015 UTC,Too much humor or just too many bad jokes?

marvelstudios,3d5k8o,the1egend1ives,14,Mon Jul 13 20:57:05 2015 UTC,Was there an awkward as fuck boob gag in Avengers? Did they sweep the damage done to the city at the end for a gag about a hammer? Did Quicksilver get a decent death that had weight to it?
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,JNPR1996,21,Mon Jul 13 21:07:04 2015 UTC,Did Age of Ultron completely sideline the threat of the main villain for a few quick laughs involving the Hulk? Did the movie completely dissolve the emotional weight of Tony's sacrifice with a joke about schwarma? Did Agent Coulson get a decent death that had weight to it? (SPOILERS: he comes back to life.)
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,the1egend1ives,7,Mon Jul 13 22:00:19 2015 UTC,"Actually it did. They dissolved the weight of Pietro's sacrifice with a hammer joke. Coulson's death was better handled, even if it was temporary."
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,JNPR1996,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:18:52 2015 UTC,"At no point was Ultron utterly rekt by a single member on the team. The joke about a hammer occurred long before or after Pietro's sacrifice. The joke about schwarma occured while Tony was still on the ground, partially unconscious. You're kidding yourself if you actually believe this. Nobody that wasn't already a huge Marvel fan had any emotional investment to Agent Coulson. He was a fucking expendable SHIELD agent. Nobody on the team actually cared that he died. They all barely knew the guy. At least Wanda's torment at Quicksilver's death was believable.    To make matters worse, his death was cheapened by the nonstop reminders from Fury (and a dying Coulson alike) that his death was a mere plot device. It would be like if Cap had constantly gone back to QS's death and said ""Well good thing Pietro's dying gave Wanda incentive to finally join the team! wink"""
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,the1egend1ives,3,Tue Jul 14 13:04:04 2015 UTC,What about when the hulk jumped into the back if the quintet and threw out Ultron? Seems like Ultron was treated just like Loki was in the first film.
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,Apples9308,2,Tue Jul 14 16:27:27 2015 UTC,"Not even slightly. At that moment, he had just finished taking a beating from Iron Man, Thor, and the Mindstone. He was trying to get away since he couldn't escape via the net. Loki didn't even put up a fight before he got rekt. He was about as physically opposing as a newborn kitten."
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,the1egend1ives,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:48:37 2015 UTC,"Vision Tony wanted levity, this was about the actual death of a teammate. Coulson had more screen time and lines than Pietro did, and we were better invested in his ass than ""You didn't see me coming, fuck no I ded, Fox and DC still hav speedsters""   Also, that's basically what they fucking did anyway."
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,JNPR1996,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:28:13 2015 UTC,"All that Vision did was shut off Ultron's escape route. That didn't stop Ultron from being a formidable foe up until he was finally weakened by the combined forces of Thor, Iron Man, and the Infinity Stone. Simply put, Ultron put up a fight. Loki did not. Loki got rekt. It doesn't take a genius to see that.  There was one joke following the death of Pietro, when Hulk throws Ultron out the Quinjet. After getting thrown, Wanda brutally murders Ultron for killing her brother, then the city comes crashing down from the sky. Vision and Ultron have their final moments before Vision takes his life. Lots of tension and drama with zero humor. Unless you're talking about afterwards at the Avengers Academy. Which makes zero sense considering that that scene takes place probably weeks after Sokovia gets destroyed.  The joke with the Hulk roaring and then Schwarma afterwards completely kills all drama happening at that moment. That Schwarma line was so bad that it was borderline slapstick. It's as if Tony's sacrifice meant absolutely nothing to the team or the filmmakers. The fact that you don't see this but continue to cite examples in Ultron shows you're blind as fuck.     I was more invested in the family bond between Wanda and Pietro than I was with Coulson and his man-crush on Steve. Coulson had three films before being killed off and I still didn't give two shits that he died. It came as zero surprise when he got stabbed because he was basically just a glorified henchman. At least there was genuine shock when Pietro was gunned down because the film was setting up Hawkeye's death so perfectly."

He should have at least wiped out some small towns on his way to the big city.  There should have been some loss at the beginning of the film and he would of been a lot more menacing. And the idea that they were able to save the world without anyone dying is ridiculous.   Other than that..very enjoyable and I'll watch it a bunch of times.
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,particularindividual,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:03:56 2015 UTC,"The first thing he did was kill Jarvis. And even setting aside Quicksilver's death you know a ton of people didn't make it out of Sekovia.  He definitely wasn't the brooding menace the trailers made him out to be, I'll give you that, but in the context of the film that makes more sense for him, and actually helps him stand out from all the other brooding menacing supervillians. Ultron may not have been super intimidating (But I'd say he was still quite threatening), but he was very memorable, and I think that's more important."

marvelstudios,3d5k8o,JuanRiveara,6,Mon Jul 13 20:41:42 2015 UTC,"Age of Ultron is one one my favorite MCU films too. It didn't really have a subgenre like TWS and Guardians, which I also feel hurt it in terms of reviews, but for being a straight up superhero film did everything extremely well and enjoyable all the way through. It'll be hard to top in my opinion."
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,alarmsoundslikewhoop,2,Mon Jul 13 20:54:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. The only thing I really feel is missing from Age of Ultron are more scenes with Thor's subplot. Other than that, I think the problem with the movie is that maybe it's too subtle for some viewers. I know that sounds crazy considering it's a big loud jokey-joke super hero movie, but I see a lot of people talking about AoU as empty, when actually there is so much in there but it takes longer to find than in most super hero films."

I know we get the deleted scenes but I can't recall any film having a standalone Directors version nor an accompanying one in a second or third disc. To the best of my knowledge[1] this just hasn't been done by Marvel at all.  More towards the topic, I think Whedon is washing his hands of Marvel Studios a bit at the moment. The interpretation from a lot of here say and subjective sources is that after he clashed with the narrative and editing of AoU he is done with being scrutinized.

marvelstudios,3d5k8o,pdthorn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:08:35 2015 UTC,marvel studios is keenly aware of the demand for runaways. I really suspect they are finding a way to pump that out so it can be monetized well and be an accurate translation from pulp to ...whatever format.
marvelstudios,3d5k8o,JuanRiveara,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:17:41 2015 UTC,A Runaways series by Joss Whedon in the same tone as Firefly would phenomenal. He wrote a great arc of them after Brian K. Vaughan left and though it wasn't as good as the previous arcs Joss really got the character'a personalities. The problem with the script Marvel already has is that it didn't seem like Drew Pearce got the characters but I have never read it so I don't know but if there is a possibility of Joss doing a Runaways show I wouldn't even care about any other shows.

marvelstudios,3d6qf2,avatizer,3,Tue Jul 14 05:23:54 2015 UTC,"I will be shocked if it does above $55m on opening weekend. I don't sense a lot of buzz for this movie in the same way there was for Jurassic World or even Guardians of the Galaxy. Mad Max had better reviews and a lot more buzz and pulled in $45m opening weekend. Granted, Ant-Man has significant family appeal, but Minions will likely take up a large part of that audience."
marvelstudios,3d6qf2,frenchpan,2,Tue Jul 14 03:27:07 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'm thinking 40 to 60 million. Minions is going to garner the attention of family and kids for a while. Depends a lot on word of mouth if it's going to do well.
marvelstudios,3d6qf2,BuckNekkid18,2,Tue Jul 14 03:49:59 2015 UTC,Mad Max is rated R...of course it's going to pull significantly less than JW or GotG.
marvelstudios,3d6qf2,JuanRiveara,4,Tue Jul 14 06:27:13 2015 UTC,I think Ant-Man will do well and hopefully better than Minions. When I first saw Despicable Me I thought the Minions were alright and funny enough but I would have never that they would be this big or even have their own movie. I'm guessing a movie can't sustain that high of ticket sales two weeks in a row so I would put my money on Ant-Man at what I'm will be around 70-80 million.
marvelstudios,3d6qf2,Worthyness,10,Mon Jul 13 23:55:25 2015 UTC,plus the reviews are basically saying that Minions is built entirely  for the kids who are entertained solely by minions shenanigans and isn't a good movie. I'm hoping it takes a huge cut because Inside out is the more deserving and significantly better children's film.
marvelstudios,3d6qf2,BuckNekkid18,2,Tue Jul 14 04:36:41 2015 UTC,65 mil and 575-620 mil at the BO.

marvelstudios,3d6qf2,biglineman,2,Tue Jul 14 13:38:53 2015 UTC,I'm saying high 80s because the buzz is very positive. Low 70s because of everything else around it.

marvelstudios,3d7inq,Mandalorianfist,2,Tue Jul 14 12:06:08 2015 UTC,"Guillermo Del Toro would be an amazing addition to the MCU roster. He's such a visually stunning director and his films bristle with such impossible sights that somehow still look completely believable. With that in mind, I think that if Kenneth Branagh is an absolute no-go for coming back to the Thor franchise then Del Toro would be a great director to take the reigns. With what he did for Hellboy, especially  Hellboy II, I think he could easily make Asgard come alive in ways we have t seen before. Plus the guy knows how to write a female character as something other than a love story. it'd be nice to see Lady Sif used as something more than ""swoon, I love Thor but he doesn't love me, I guess I'll go look brooding now"" like she was in the 2nd movie. Don't think he'd be able to help Natalie Portman though. That woman's acting is about a bland as two slices of dry white toast."

I think his style of filmmaking would suit Iron Fist or Luke Cage more, also Deadpool or Iron Man would be cool."

They can find a way to organically insert Pete talking about Uncle Ben, ""great power - great responsibility"", and getting bit by a spider. Hell, I'm not really even that opposed of them diverging completely from canon. Steve Rogers could give him the great responsibility speech in Civil War.

Since then, Disney could do whatever they wanted with the building block Spidey license, and they did.

There's a Spider-man Lego movie in the works, so the character at least must be usable there.  I don't know about the new movie version.  But Spidey is such a hot franchise (it's THE biggest superhero merchandise movie) it might be one of those things where when Lego or Megablocks signs up for a deal with Marvel, they don't get exclusivity."

marvelstudios,3d9rdm,Remi15,9,Tue Jul 14 17:48:33 2015 UTC,But even movies with multiple heroes can have one who is the focal point. Just like Civil War will. That indicates that they are the story's central component.

Man of Steel works okay.  But if Captain America had just been called The First Avenger (which in some countries it might have been) that wouldn't have worked well.

marvelstudios,3d7pdo,Metfan722,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:17:45 2015 UTC,Punisher is a Marine.  It would make more sense for him to have fought in say the Second Battle of Fallujah.
marvelstudios,3d7pdo,knowledgeoverswag,2,Tue Jul 14 14:36:05 2015 UTC,"This has been one of my biggest concerns.  A lot of people who are more familiar with Ultimate Punisher believe that the character is supposed to be a cop. Several different online news sites even suggested that Bernthal's Punisher will be a police officer who's family is intentionally killed by King Pin to exert pressure on him.   I can't begin to list the number of problems with this scenario. The most integral parts of the character are that he's a trained killer, which puts him in a completely different mindset than a police officer. He wages war on the criminal underworld because war is what he knows.   As a Marine Recon member he went places we weren't supposed to be, doing things that can't be disclosed and surviving horrors the rest of society can't imagine.  The best thing Daredevil could do would be to leave it vague. Explore that shit in depth if he gets his own show.  But even more important than his background is the fact that his family's deaths were savage and random. The random is key because this is what makes Frank the Punisher. He has no off switch.  There's no single enemy to defeat, no specific target for his revenge so he takes it out on all crime.   It's without a doubt the single most important part of the characters formation and makes him different than every other revenge killer in fiction."
marvelstudios,3d7pdo,youmonsterikill,2,Tue Jul 14 07:06:51 2015 UTC,I agree 100%. His backstory should be vague. They should respect the character and not try to update him for the show.
marvelstudios,3d7pdo,OlDirtyBanana,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:13:51 2015 UTC,Right. It's a tough decision because so much of the character is a product of Vietnam. I don't think an update would accurately capture the shear isolation and lack of support that drove him to the brink. That said if they do update he should be a veteran of numerous undisclosed conflicts around the world.
marvelstudios,3d7pdo,youmonsterikill,3,Tue Jul 14 15:24:55 2015 UTC,"War is hell no matter where it is. I'm guessing Fank has seen kids sitting on grenades to trap US soldiers, women getting raped, towns being burned, innocent people being used as shields for the other military, kids carrying weapons and they're forced to put them down.   Which war did I describe, Vietnam or Iraq?"
marvelstudios,3d7pdo,Beaner8127,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:05:40 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree that there is a similar tone and narrative to both wars. If I had to update the character to a modern real world conflict it would definitely be Iraq. The major difference between the conflicts though is we actually did learn from some of our mistakes, and soldiers in Iraq had more support, structure and oversight than those in the overwhelmed arrangement in Vietnam. I think because the soldiers in Iraq were not met with same kind of disdain and were not held personally responsible for the deaths their wasn't the same type of isolation that made Frank Castle the Punisher. They even touch on the support structure for returning veterans in Winter Soldier. I feel like Punisher has to come from a place of chaos, where there was no anchor and no support structure."
marvelstudios,3d7pdo,youmonsterikill,2,Tue Jul 14 18:17:00 2015 UTC,And the draft. Volunteering to fill a slot to help some other kid being forced over there is a lot different from signing up for the GIBILL or because you have been duped into propaganda. The NAM is a core component of Castle's heroic code as much as WW2 is to Cap's. Morality and skills of a Col.Kurtz level rogue is central. People even talk about making him a Cop?!  Really hoping they thoughtfully address this mess of concerns.
marvelstudios,3d7pdo,Seekasak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:47:35 2015 UTC,"I'm on the opposite side of your opinion. Frank's story can work by changing the war. He's a war veteran who's see all angles of Hell while fighting for his country, comes home and looses his family to the mob."
marvelstudios,3d7pdo,Beaner8127,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:03:15 2015 UTC,If they make Punisher a cop and not a solider it would ruin the whole MCU for me. I mean he has been described as the greatest solider on by Fury but the MCU has been powering down its characters but I hope they make him a solider.Were you worried when you saw he had no Skull on his shirt because I was because it means they might do his origin in the show which might be a bad idea.
marvelstudios,3d7pdo,SwagBelow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:50:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about the skull because we know nothing about the context of the scene. It's a leak, not an official release. Marvel knows how iconic that skull is. It will definitely be there when it matters."
marvelstudios,3d7pdo,youmonsterikill,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:17:30 2015 UTC,"This is the character bio for Punisher in the Ultimate universe (spoiler tagged as there is a chance Daredevil will borrow plot points from it); long story short, he is an NYPD officer whose family is killed by crooked cops who he tried to expose.  One of the NYPD'S finest, Frank Castle refused to stand by while his partner and other officers took bribes from the mysterious underworld figure known as the Owl. Turning them in to Internal Affairs, Frank made himself a target -- the officers he exposed sought revenge, gunning Frank and his family down while they were on a picnic in the park. The sole survivor, Frank became the twisted, murderous vigilante known as the Punisher. Gaining a cult following his extreme brand of justice, the Punisher eventually went too far when he killed one of the cops who had slaughtered his family. Imprisoned on Ryker's Island, the Punisher continued his work, killing nine unrepentant criminals, including Jim Washington, a convicted rapist who had been apprehended by Daredevil; but Frank had unfinished business, and took the first opportunity to escape. Free again, the Punisher killed two more of the crooked cops behind his family's murder, including his former partner, Bruce Greenwood, who was visiting his attorney, Matt Murdock, at the time. Chased by Daredevil, the Punisher managed to escape, nearly killing Daredevil in the process.  Tracking Artie Jillette, the final living member of the group who had killed his family and the go-between between the Owl and the other corrupt Cops, to his apartment, the Punisher held him at gunpoint, but was unable to kill the man in front of his children. Forcing Artie up to the roof, the Punisher was once more confronted by Daredevil, who appealed to his sense of justice, claiming he would make sure Jillette was sentenced for his crimes. Before the Punisher could consider Daredevil's claims, Spider-Man blindsided him, knocking him out and letting Artie escape. Daredevil ordered Spider-Man to take the Punisher to the police while he captured Artie; later, as attorney Matt Murdock, he defended the Punisher in court. Jillette was reunited with the Punisher in jail, where Frank's friends on the inside made sure they were cellmates, ensuring the Punisher's revenge."
marvelstudios,3d7pdo,bmatul,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:23:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think, and hope, he will be. There's plenty of conflicts that he could have been a part of, and the MCU isn't even our exact world so they could make one up if they wanted. Bernthal is old enough to have been in Iraq if Frank is going to be his age, and that war had similar political tones to Vietnam."
marvelstudios,3d7pdo,grntplmr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:40:58 2015 UTC,I think it'd be cool if he was a vet of the conflicts in the Eastern Block (think Yugoslavia in the 90s except say he was a Special Forces on the ground since in reality we didn't go in on the ground) but change Yugoslavia with Sokovia so it has a nice subtle connection to the overall MCU.

marvelstudios,3d7pdo,youmonsterikill,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:28:48 2015 UTC,"After seeing the military haircut in those set photos (which is a bummer because I wanted the Ennis/Bradstreet slicked back/balding hair), I'm pretty sure we can bet that he is a veteran. Assuming that they feel the need to explain a back-story I think it would make the most sense for the MCU Frank Castle to have a history with a PMC like Blackwater or something who operated on a global scale and did some ""nasty stuff"" (as Nick Fury would say). It could be cool to have flashback scenes with him touring in various international MCU locations (including Sokovia or Wakanda!) with the potential for some awesome other references or cameos while showing how he acquired his ""specific skill set""."
marvelstudios,3d7pdo,HighTreazon,2,Tue Jul 14 14:19:11 2015 UTC,"well it would tie in with his appetite for war -- if he was a PMC. I mean, Punisher: BORN was a fucking maddening, creepy look into the psyche of Castle during that time. I'm hoping they just broach the subject of him doing multiple tours and joining a PMC to get more action before his family being taken from him.   And who knows, man? If a Punisher/Netflix series gets greenlit, that hair can always grow back and get slicked back :)"
marvelstudios,3d7pdo,electrodrone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:32:06 2015 UTC,"The downside of the PMC is that it makes Frank Castle less sympathetic. He is supposed to be a great soldier who is let down by his country. He shouldn't choose war until it's forced upon him. Yes, he comes to crave the peace he finds in battle, but to have him seeking that out before Valley Forge would, I feel, distort the character's ideological center. Punisher has historically never respected soldiers for hire.  I do however love the idea of seeing the MCU and it's fictional conflicts from the perspective of those doing the wetwork."
marvelstudios,3d7pdo,youmonsterikill,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:38:46 2015 UTC,If I had to choose I'd want Fank not to be a mercenary. The man has a great respect for his country and the U.S. military. I've commonly heard that the only difference between Captain America and Punisher was the wars they fought.

marvelstudios,3d2xqj,samsaBEAR,27,Mon Jul 13 09:28:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm pretty much seeing every film on the slate from DC/Marvel with the exception of Fantastic Four.
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,Sonofsnow,9,Mon Jul 13 10:32:19 2015 UTC,"I'm actually intrigued by FF more than I thought I'd be... kinda looks like they are going the Ultimate route, which I really hope they do."
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,jasonhaven,7,Mon Jul 13 10:43:09 2015 UTC,The news that they are pulling the plug on the 3D release has made me completely lose interest in the movie (even though I hate 3D). Sounds like the studio doesn't want to throw any more money into that hole.
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,ShadyBiz,6,Mon Jul 13 15:23:59 2015 UTC,"Ooomph, yeah that's not a good sign. I guess initial viewing sessions haven't gone well? I think FF is gonna have to be folded into an existing universe to take off again, the concept is a little hokey, and the previous films probably leave a bad taste in the general audiences mouth. I could see it really working with some of the weird directions the MCU is taking, but not sure if that's even a possibility."
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,jasonhaven,-6,Mon Jul 13 16:10:11 2015 UTC,"The news that they are pulling the plug on the 3D release has made me completely lose interest in the movie (even though I hate 3D).   Oh my god who even farking cares? You're obviously free to go by your own metric on what makes a movie worth seeing, but I think it's pretty damn stupid that you base it not on whether it looks good to you, but behind the scenes studio nonsense."
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,Tom-ocil,2,Mon Jul 13 19:06:32 2015 UTC,Evidence that the studio is avoiding putting money into a movie because they feel it is crap is a perfectly valid thing to take into consideration.
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,EVula,0,Mon Jul 13 22:22:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, but please keep in mind that when it comes to choosing whether or not to spend your hard earned money on a movie, ANY reason is 'valid'. As I said, he's free to use his own metric and make his own decisions.  I just maintain it's stupid. As if movie studios, and how they feel, are in ANY way a reliable indicator of quality. For all we know Fantastic Four is an incredible movie, and some dipshit execs are worries that it needs more punching and a wise cracking robot sidekick.  Besides that, how about people meet a movie on its own terms and make up their own minds? I mean, it's one thing if a movie comes out and is panned left and right by critics. But 'the studio doesn't want to spend the money on 3D, and we all know STUDIO HEADS are the experts on what constitutes a good movie, so I'll pass'.  Ugh. Again, fine by me if that's how you live your life. But just dumb, and unfair to the movie."
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,Tom-ocil,2,Mon Jul 13 22:33:24 2015 UTC,"Who said we need to be fair to the movie?  Everything we've heard about from behind the scenes of this movie has been shitty.   It has been called a mess by people at Fox, the company making it. They had to rebuild a whole heap of shit and reshoot large sections of the movie. They don't give a shit about the source material The director went off the rails, so much so that he was seemingly sacked from an upcoming star wars movie It's another bloody origin story It's FOX The casting choices look really underwhelming This isn't the first time they have pushed out a shitty F4 movie for the sole reason of keeping the filming rights The last ones sucked And now the studio is dumping planned parts of production   By some bizarre miracle, the movie may be amazing but we don't live in a vacuum and these are all solid red flags about a movie.  You are 100% right in that the critics and reception of the movie will be the deciding factor, but in the meantime I certainly won't be seeing it unless that miracle occurs."
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,ShadyBiz,-5,Tue Jul 14 00:17:04 2015 UTC,"Everything you just said was pointless. Literally nothing I've said has been an argument for why this movie will be good, or a defense of the behind the scenes reports.  I repeat, for the third time: whatever way you make up your mind whether to see a movie or not is fine. See the movie, don't see the movie, I don't care.  Here's the part of the guys logic that makes sense: 'The studio doesn't want to pay for a 3D conversion, meaning the studio doesn't have faith in the movie...'  Here's where it gets dumb:  '...and since the studio doesn't have faith in the movie, it is probably bad'.  Whatever. There have been so many movies that studios didn't have faith in that are incredible, and so much garbage that the studios have been utterly enamored with that were shit. You're saying to me ""It's Fox"" all exasperated, like they're the biggest idiots in the world. Well, OK, these people who you think are complete imbeciles don't have faith in FF. Sooo.....are you trusting the imbeciles judgment, or what?"
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,Tom-ocil,5,Tue Jul 14 00:26:09 2015 UTC,"They made Doctor Doom a whiny teenage Hacker with the hacker name ""Doom"".

marvelstudios,3d2xqj,ThebigP,3,Tue Jul 14 04:54:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Also, it's insulting to the comic book fans. It's like saying, ""Remember how Thor can summon lightning?

marvelstudios,3d2xqj,Kaladinar,34,Tue Jul 14 03:53:16 2015 UTC,"You know, I'm just happy to see that there is going to be a difference in the tone of both Cinematic Universes. Marvels tone so far has been pretty family friendly/comedic(excluding Daredevil of course) while still telling epic stories, and DC seems to want to take a more dark and serious tone(too early to tell if that's good move or not), but one thing is for sure, both will have different flavors and its exiting to see how they will evolve."
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,Robotshavenohearts,15,Mon Jul 13 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"With DC's output so far (MoS and BvS certainly looks to follow), it's more Zack Synder's 'hyper realism' look that is driving DC's direction I think. With Suicide Squad it's more difficult to tell how cohesive this will all be."
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,AspsVeryDangerous,3,Mon Jul 13 10:32:48 2015 UTC,Indeed!
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,Robotshavenohearts,6,Mon Jul 13 11:57:59 2015 UTC,"Hyper-realism in one sense (more grounded emotions, and destruction), but in another sense, Snyder does fantastic really well, as can be seen in how the heroes move and are designed in his various adaptations. Hell, Batman looks quick and agile for once!"
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,jasonhaven,9,Mon Jul 13 11:59:40 2015 UTC,Watchmen is one of my favorite comic book movies of all time! I have faith in Snyder
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,dra39437,-2,Mon Jul 13 16:11:25 2015 UTC,I hope it's as cohesive as Rocket Raccoon and Doctor Strange existing in the same universe.
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,suss2it,5,Mon Jul 13 16:37:08 2015 UTC,"Well Marvel has the more realistic characters so they can be wild and extravagant with their movies. Whereas DC's characters are completely over-powered so they have to make the movies very dark and realistic to make the characters feel real. I didn't care that much for MoS (maybe because Superman is boring as hell), but BvS looks really good and WOW Suicide Squad looks sooo good. The one thing that DC has is very fleshed out villains. Honestly I'd love to see a movie about the Gotham City Sirens (Catwoman, Harley and Poison Ivy)."

marvelstudios,3d2xqj,SplendidDevil,7,Tue Jul 14 03:57:10 2015 UTC,"I mean, generally speaking it looks like a lot of people are hoping DC starts making really great movies to prevent Marvel from becoming complacent. I really hope BvS is great, just because the more great movies there are means more quality entertainment period.  And it's awesome seeing all of these crazy concepts coming to life in ways I would have never imagined as a kid! I still remember renting episodes of the 70's live-action Spider-Man TV series from Blockbuster and being disappointed in how it wasn't what I pictured while reading the comics. Never mind ever having hopes of an awesome Iron-Man movie -hold my goddamn horses with that hope no one even knows who he is. Now? It's a completely different culture.  I guess I still can't get over how awesome things are after seeing the slog of crap -true b-movie crap mind you- that plagued live adaptations of comic book characters for a long, long time. Even the mid 2000's were dark times outside of Spider-Man and Batman.  Wow, I digressed big time. Anyway, I'm psyched DC appears ambitious and I hope competition spurs Marvel into new heights of quality.   edit: Spider-Man, Batman, and X-Men in mid 2000's were still good. But there were more than a few worrisome contributions. Although I still enjoy Thomas Janes Punisher movie, sue me. I can't wait for Daredevil season 2."
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,1of7billion,4,Mon Jul 13 11:34:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if a lot are members of both... I know I am. My favorite character of all time is Batman... but on average I like Marvel more as a company. So for me, seeing Batman and Superman on screen? One of the biggest deals for me since some of my favorite Batman stories are ones where he's either vs or best friends with Superman. They have a great contrast, not just in power, but in mindset."

We're in a golden age of comic book movies, that we can even have a debate about which company's movies are better is great.  The people that act like you can only like one or the other are annoying as shit. I just want to see good stories up on the big screen."

It's best for all of us if DC knocks it out of the park with their franchise, especially with a different tone. As a superhero, its a good time to be alive :)  These movies are doing a good job of replacing comicbook reading for me, since comic universes have gotten way more convoluted compared to when I was younger (things like 2 x-men books vs 10 x-men books, and every story being a crossover of sorts)."

Marvel has really fucked around with over-saturating the X-men books.

marvelstudios,3d2xqj,cheezballs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:40:21 2015 UTC,"Not quite that old haha, but not far off... Let's go to the early 90s with Uncanny X-Men, and X-Men they're a good example of ""just"" two X-Men books. Blue and Gold team, they basically kept to their own adventures, and if you followed a certain character you knew which team they were on, and what book they'd be in, and crossover were minimal from what I remember. Now, its... All New X-Men, Amazing X-Men, Uncanny X-Men, and Wolverine and the X-Men? I think? Plus the members of each book seems to change pretty regularly, and it feels like there's a crossover every month or two. I dunno... maybe I'm just getting old. I do agree, sometime in the early 2000s, if not late 90s, the comic market in general changed... geared towards collecting, speculation, and saturating popular titles and crossovers. I've had a hard time staying current since then, and now prefer to pick up collected editions/graphic novels after the fact, so I can just focus on one story at a time."

Uh... so better than all of them except half of them (11 movies so far: 3 Iron Man movies + Guardians + 2 Avengers movies = 6)? That isn't exactly a great achievement.  However, you're not entirely right. With a budget of $225 million, Man of Steel made $668 million. That is only (heh, ""only"") a gain of $443 million.  The MCU movies: (budget / box office / difference)   Iron Man 1: $140 million / $585 million / $445 million The Incredible Hulk: $150 million / $263 million / $113 million Iron Man 2: $200 million / $624 million / $424 million Thor: $150 million / $449 million / $299 million Captain America 1: $140 million / $371 million / $231 million The Avengers: $220 million / $1.5 billion / $1.28 billion Iron Man 3: $200 million / $1.2 billion / $1 billion Thor 2: $170 million / $645 million / $475 million Captain America 2: $170 million / $715 million / $545 million Guardians: $196 million / $774 million / $578 million Avengers 2: $280 million / $1.4 billion / $1.12 billion   Man of Steel may have made more at the box office than a few of the movies, but it also cost significantly more to make, so it wasn't nearly as profitable. There were actually seven MCU movies (Iron Man 1, Avengers 1, Iron Man 3, Thor 2, Captain America 2, Guardians, Avengers 2) that performed better than Man of Steel.  Plus, Ant-Man has a budget of $130 million, so it only needs to make $313 million at the box office just to match Man of Steel. That is entirely possible, so there could possibly be eight MCU movies that are more profitable than Man of Steel (though it is obviously a little premature to make that declaration).  (all numbers pulled from Wikipedia's List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films page)"

Also I was using domestic numbers for all the movies since that's what studios care about the most since they get more of that then they do from the international box office. Either way I don't really give a shit about box office numbers since I'll never see that money, I'm just pointing out that WB can already compete with Marvel Studios."
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,suss2it,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:38:03 2015 UTC,"Man of Steel also made a shit ton of money with all that product placement. At least $150 million.   The Marvel movies have product placement as well (something I'm keenly aware of during almost every movie, since I drive an Acura). It's difficult to compare movies on that level since we don't have firm numbers for everything.   Also I was using domestic numbers for all the movies since that's what studios care about the most since they get more of that then they do from the international box office.   That still ignores the budgets involved, though. (it's simple math: spending more money to make slightly more money isn't the best return on a studio's investment) For example, with a budget of $225 million, Man of Steel made $291 million domestically; that's only a difference of $66 million. Compare that with Iron Man 1, which made $318 million domestically on a $140 million budget (a difference of $178 million).   Either way I don't really give a shit about box office numbers since I'll never see that money   I'm never going to see that money either. I find them useful only in that they are standardized, quantifiable means of comparison for the movies in question. The only other method we have is Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic scores (which I've posted below).   I'm just pointing out that WB can already compete with Marvel Studios.   That's fine, but your phrasing suggested that Man of Steel outperformed all of the Marvel Studios movies with only a couple of exceptions, and that isn't the case. In total box office receipts, Man of Steel was eclipsed by seven movies, and in domestic revenue, eclipsed by six movies; either way, more than half of Marvel Studios' movies have performed better.  And if we want to expand this discussion about DC competing with Marvel Studios to cover the critical response, DC gets a massive black eye: Man of Steel has a 56% score on Rotten Tomatoes and 55/100 on Metacritic. Every single MCU movie has a higher Rotten Tomatoes (the lowest-rated movie, Thor 2, has a 65% rating), and only a single movie (Thor 2 again) has a lower Metacritic score.  Given money and rating numbers, I think it's entirely fair to think that Warner Bros. hasn't exactly shown that they can compete with Marvel Studios. (though I acknowledge that it's difficult to compare a single movie against an entire franchise, especially when that franchise has had a few underperforming movies like The Incredible Hulk)"

marvelstudios,3d2xqj,Stoopid-Stoner,15,Mon Jul 13 06:42:53 2015 UTC,The trailer for SS looked pretty great too. Im excited to see Leto's joker.
marvelstudios,3d2xqj,tfoust,5,Mon Jul 13 06:45:55 2015 UTC,I felt it looked too serious. I know DC is trying for super serious but I feel like this movie should have been a breather from the seriousness. But Joker did look really good in those couple if seconds.

marvelstudios,3d2xqj,suss2it,4,Mon Jul 13 06:59:21 2015 UTC,El Diablo is a pretty cool character. I'm glad that DC and Marvel both step outta the box and use characters the general audience wouldn't immediately be familiar with.

I think Bucky will most likely take over the reins of Captain America sometime soon. Not sure who will replace Iron Man. Rhodey would be ideal, but age may become a factor. Not sure how many movies Paul Rudd signed up for, but imagine Scott Lang and any of the new Avengers (Dr. Strange, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, etc) will be around for the next several years.

That's something I enjoy about the leaked exclusive trailers.   Those people in Hall H or wherever they host those spent hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, waited for hours and even days, and missed all the other cool shit happening around them. They deserve a little something for their troubles. For studios, it's easier to play a two minute video, than to give away some stuff.   Warner showing the trailer exclusively to the attendees of their panel wasn't wrong. Warner Bros passive aggressively bitching of how people put half of the trailer online was wrong. They KNEW going in that someone was going to do it. They should be happy that people are excited for Suicide Squad, but they preferred to show how out of touch they were by whining about having to release it early. That statement should've never happened.   The Star Wars panel did it right. You can't replicate an orchestral performance on a phone camera.   Marvel gagging the party scene from Ultron after they showed it last year made me even more excited for it."

Every bit of information given at these events is relayed back to the fans that are following the productions, and that's how it's meant to be. So why not just show the trailer?  The vast majority of moviegoers aren't even aware that movies like Suicide Squad and Civil War are coming out, much less refreshing trade sites for the newest bit of information. Releasing an early trailer only builds good will among die hard fans that are going to see the movie anyways.   That said, I understand the logic. That Suicide Squad trailer was probably going to end up being a full theatrical trailer of some sort, after a teaser. Now the marketing team at WB has to pretty much skip the teaser because we have already essentially gotten a full trailer for a movie that is still over a year away. When it comes time to heavily promote the movie, they are going to have to use up more footage from the film to replace what would have been their first full trailer. So I get it, but I am a fan, so I am impatient."

But you're eating up every morsel they're showing, AND you're mad that they're showing too much. Good work. Thanks."

marvelstudios,3d918t,j4_jjjj,0,Wed Jul 15 17:03:12 2015 UTC,"the thing with falcon, imo, is that his appearance is meant to be a way to entice the more casual movie goer to see it. without showing that in a trailer, they lose some of the casual fans who may have waited. other than that, i agree completely. way too much footage in these clips"
marvelstudios,3d918t,Faskil,0,Tue Jul 14 14:03:29 2015 UTC,"Why would they? It's been working very well so far and it's very efficient to generate extra buzz around the movies.

marvelstudios,3d918t,CyanShades,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:53:51 2015 UTC,Releasing the Suicide Squad trailer officially created a ton of buzz for that film.
marvelstudios,3d713b,bucketofsteam,4,Tue Jul 14 00:47:34 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not I think whether or not we get a shadowland arc will depend on how they break Iron Fist. There is a lot debate going on about how far into the mystical world they can tread without sacrificing the gritty, wire-like world they sought to build in the first place.  All the peices are in place if they want to proceed with a shadowland arc. (which I think would be amazing) But it's definitely a very difficult line to tread.  I think marvel needs to bite the bullet and dive in head first. With Dr. Strange, Iron Fist, and the majority of Daredevils mythology being rooted in the fantastical they should embrace it now and find other ways to explore the grounded crime drama genre."
marvelstudios,3d713b,youmonsterikill,2,Tue Jul 14 02:15:22 2015 UTC,I liked what they have done so far with the mystical side. Especially with madam gao. Not letting us know too much but showing she is definitely not an ordinary person. Then there was the boy stick was sent to kill as well as the hand ninjas which were all handled very well.

marvelstudios,3d713b,mwriteword,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:52:21 2015 UTC,if they do a moon knight in the MCU I feel like they may have to modernize it? or change certain aspects of his character to make him more fitted in the current universe.

The comic Defenders originally had Silver Surfer, Namor, Hulk, and Doctor Strange amongst it's roster and they went on a lot of weird supernatural adventures.  The MCU Defenders looks more like the comic Heroes for Hire, which usually had a roster of street level heroes who dealt with street level crime with the occasional supervillain."

What I DO think is that Snipes is talking AT Marvel about Blade and is putting it out into the media to pressure Marvel cause Snipes needs money.  I don't think anyone at Marvel is seriously considering using Snipes in a new Blade movie, especially considering he's 50 and a Blade movie wouldn't hit theaters until at least 2020."
marvelstudios,3d5jm1,mrthewhite,3,Mon Jul 13 18:44:51 2015 UTC,"Right. Someone suggested that Snipes was being pursued to voice Blade in a videogame. I think Snipes may have legitimately talked with Marvel about this, and is now trying to parlay it into something, grander. Marvel may indeed be looking at the bringing Blade into the MCU at some point however I don't think for a minute they wouldn't reboot the character."
marvelstudios,3d5jm1,youmonsterikill,2,Mon Jul 13 18:54:19 2015 UTC,A Blade video game has some pretty good potential. This makes more sense than the rumors about Snipes reprising his role.
marvelstudios,3d5jm1,rauakbar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:56:25 2015 UTC,He really doesn't need the money. He really feels like he's Blade how RDJ is Iron Man. He won't be Blade though. Now I can see Michael Jae White as Blade.

marvelstudios,3d5jm1,xxbeast15,3,Tue Jul 14 02:09:17 2015 UTC,What if they did bring Snipes back for this type of role in a tv show instead? Like have him be a retired vampire hunter training his daughter.
marvelstudios,3d5jm1,youmonsterikill,3,Mon Jul 13 19:05:47 2015 UTC,From a what if stand point that would be cool. You can explain away Blades aging because I think he ages at a normal human rate since he's half human. And then you have a African American woman as the lead... (If you care about that stuff) the Prime time TV shows have focus a lot on strong female leads.
marvelstudios,3d4smo,TheSwampDweller,7,Mon Jul 13 15:01:12 2015 UTC,Mads Mikkelsen. He can be an alien or asgardian.
marvelstudios,3d4smo,Really_A_Shill,3,Mon Jul 13 17:14:54 2015 UTC,how about the chameleon?

marvelstudios,3d4smo,mikeweasy,7,Mon Jul 13 17:27:34 2015 UTC,silvermane or the vulture
marvelstudios,3d4smo,JuanRiveara,2,Mon Jul 13 17:28:35 2015 UTC,A Thor villain
marvelstudios,3d4smo,xxbeast15,7,Tue Jul 14 02:40:39 2015 UTC,Steve Buscemi. He's my choice for Mysterio but I would want him as anyone.
marvelstudios,3d4smo,JuanRiveara,2,Mon Jul 13 17:22:10 2015 UTC,I see him more as Vulture material.
marvelstudios,3d4smo,xxbeast15,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:20:16 2015 UTC,Quentin Beck always kind of reminded a bit of Quentin Tarantino if he wasn't successful. And Steve Buscemi practically played an extreme version of Tarantino is Resevoir Dogs(Tarantino based the character off of himself and was meant to play the role) so that's how got to that. Buscemi would kill it in any role though.
marvelstudios,3d4smo,Qtzar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:37:48 2015 UTC,I agree. I think he would definatly kill the menacing aspects especially of Mysterio. I'm personally in the bruce campbell boat though.
marvelstudios,3d4smo,Inspace96,7,Mon Jul 13 18:42:39 2015 UTC,Bruce Campbell but I have no idea what role he could play.... maybe Namor?

marvelstudios,3d4smo,DadJazz,0,Mon Jul 13 19:22:38 2015 UTC,Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) would be perfectly cast as Namor.

marvelstudios,3d4smo,JNPR1996,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:34:12 2015 UTC,Green Man would probably be good for him. Chance he could also pull of Day Man though.

marvelstudios,3d4smo,JNPR1996,-8,Mon Jul 13 15:13:24 2015 UTC,They missed out on Donald Glover as Spider-Man.
marvelstudios,3d4smo,Wombat_H,16,Mon Jul 13 17:44:30 2015 UTC,We just had a 30 year old Spider-Man
marvelstudios,3d4smo,christlarson94,6,Mon Jul 13 18:28:15 2015 UTC,No they didn't. He'll be 32 when the movie comes out.
marvelstudios,3d4smo,Wombat_H,-7,Mon Jul 13 18:57:45 2015 UTC,Which is why they missed out.
marvelstudios,3d4smo,christlarson94,5,Mon Jul 13 19:09:06 2015 UTC,"Except he was never a possibility. The first time he ever acted, he was already 22."
marvelstudios,3d4smo,Wombat_H,-5,Mon Jul 13 19:14:07 2015 UTC,And the last actor to play a teenage Spider-Man was 30. I don't know what your point is.
marvelstudios,3d4smo,christlarson94,4,Mon Jul 13 19:19:24 2015 UTC,And he was way too old and looked nothing like a teenager.
marvelstudios,3d4smo,Wombat_H,-8,Mon Jul 13 19:20:38 2015 UTC,"Oh. So the problem here is that you don't understand the difference between your opinion as a person and what film studios consider ""possible"" regarding casting."
marvelstudios,3d4smo,christlarson94,5,Mon Jul 13 19:25:00 2015 UTC,We've known since the deal went through that Marvel has wanted a teenage Spider-Man.

marvelstudios,3d4smo,SengalBoy,5,Mon Jul 13 17:10:46 2015 UTC,jesus christ he is a phenomenal actor. I fucking hate him in the best possible way . I think he would make a great mystero as well as maximus

She doesn't necessarily have to be Squirrel Girl like everyone says, but she'd certainly be good at it.  Otherwise, there are tons of supporting characters she could play."
marvelstudios,3d4smo,AshH654,7,Mon Jul 13 15:11:21 2015 UTC,I think she would be great in one of the netflix shows the same way they use foggy in daredevil
marvelstudios,3d4smo,OhJayPea,6,Mon Jul 13 15:12:57 2015 UTC,"Matt Smith. And a few years later Peter Capaldi. Don't really care for the characters, but Marvel started to recycle Dr. Who/BBC actors."

marvelstudios,3d4smo,silverdragon989,2,Mon Jul 13 16:49:44 2015 UTC,Tennant was the second Doctor in the MCU. Eccleston played Malekith in Thor: TDW. So they got the first two Doctors of the new series and a companion of the third one.
marvelstudios,3d4smo,UnbarringTomb,3,Mon Jul 13 17:19:04 2015 UTC,2 companions of the third one. Amy pond was nebula and Clara was Bucky's girlfriend in a WWII scene of tWS

marvelstudios,3d4smo,UmbrusNightshade,2,Mon Jul 13 16:17:04 2015 UTC,"Oh hell yes. Though they might want someone younger, Neeson would be best suited to a role outside of the traditional hero or villain. I can't imagine him being terribly evil, but I also can't imagine him being terribly nice either."

marvelstudios,3d4smo,jabrd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:16:06 2015 UTC,"Not saying that I would have wanted them to do this, but I just had a mental image of Liam Neeson as the original, white Nick Fury from the comic books.

marvelstudios,3d4smo,RSGoodfellow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:22:09 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. He is notorious in the industry for being very difficult to work with. He got in the film then cried until they let him write and rewrite stuff. He wasn't hired to write (as far as I know) so he shouldn't have been allowed, but from what I've gathered it was either he gets his way or he walks. At that time Marvel was really trying to make money and keep things going so they felt his fame would help the film and they let him have his way."

marvelstudios,3d1miu,LazerMcBlazer,11,Mon Jul 13 01:27:21 2015 UTC,It's part of the MCU fandom. The actors making content for the fans to enjoy and share. Lighten up.

marvelstudios,3d1miu,your_mind_aches,-6,Mon Jul 13 05:43:03 2015 UTC,"Right. And there is someone saying ""I like Agents of Shield, but this Justin Bieber, teenage girl, making posts about the actors eating cookies and wearing shirts, instagram dubsmash bullshit is really annoying"" and getting infinity downvotes. And no, it doesn't have anything to do with the MCU. It has to do with being interested and discussing people's personal lives and referring to them by their first names and obsessing over instagram posts. And someone is getting down voted to oblivion for saying it's annoying that this subreddit pretty much feels like what I imagine the Gossip Girl or One Direction subreddit feels like."
marvelstudios,3d1miu,LazerMcBlazer,4,Mon Jul 13 06:03:15 2015 UTC,"personal lives   They literally post this stuff on social media for the fans to share and be entertained by. Which I've tried to say twice already. Invading their personal lives would be going to their homes and taking pictures, following them around, asking about their previous drug addiction while they're there for an interview about a movie. We haven't discussed their personal lives even a little bit. And their reception to our reception of this is positive. Why else would they keep it going?   Okay another thing. What exactly is wrong with teenage girls? I'd really like to see how you explain that.    Gossip Girl or One Direction subreddit    Oh grow up. Are the fans of One Direction or Gossip Girl immature? Probably? But it isn't my place or yours to judge.   In fact, if you judge people who enjoy this, you should be judging the actors even more."

marvelstudios,3d299v,keine_fragen,4,Sun Jul 12 23:03:25 2015 UTC,I'd like to know if the deal with Universal only allows Marvel to use the Hulk in Avengers movies and nothing else. That'd explain the character's exit in AoU. Although that still leaves open the question of how they're managing to have Thunderbolt Ross in Civil War since he's a Hulk character
marvelstudios,3d299v,ThunderJRodriguez,9,Mon Jul 13 05:10:33 2015 UTC,They have the rights to Hulk and all his characters just not the distribution rights. This means they can use Hulk and his characters in films that aren't his own(Avengers and Captain America) but not a solo film since Unversal would be the ones that would distribute it.
marvelstudios,3d299v,JuanRiveara,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:32:53 2015 UTC,Don't forget Banner cameo at the end of Iron Man 3 as well.
marvelstudios,3d299v,TriggerHippie77,4,Mon Jul 13 13:43:46 2015 UTC,So basically Universal holding the theme park rights to Marvel characters that Disney wants is holding up the Hulk rights.
marvelstudios,3d299v,rkkim,11,Sun Jul 12 23:12:14 2015 UTC,"I actually don't think that has anything to do with it. This article was pretty crappy and added nothing that we didnt already know.  Marvel sold film rights for Hulk to Universal, similar to how they sold the rights to Xmen and Fantastic Four to Fox, Spiderman to Sony, Ghost Rider and Punisher to Lionsgate, etc. Apparently Universal also has the film rights to Namor, although Universal has yet to do anything with the property. The details of those deals aren't publicly known, but at some point before being bought by Disney, Marvel also sold the theme park rights to Universal for use in their Universal Studios park."
marvelstudios,3d299v,ThunderJRodriguez,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:07:38 2015 UTC,I was under the impression Namor had reverted.

marvelstudios,3d299v,marvelking666,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:47:01 2015 UTC,"Hmm, clearly nobody at Universal or Disney has studied the Coase Theorem. Initial allocation of property rights should not prevent the final allocation of rights to the firm that can make the most use thereof.   Put in laymen turns, there is some amount of money Disney can transfer to Universal in exchange for the rights to distribute a Hulk film. However much money Disney is making off of the Hulk within the confines of the Avenger franchise, it's lower than they could be making outside it, and Universal can't distribute a film Disney's not making. Hopefully someone who's taken Econ 1101 can get the ear of Feige or Iger.  The upshot is that so long as Disney can expect Hulk films to make more, on average, than the films they would push down in the lineup, Disney should be willing to pay some of that difference to Universal for the distribution rights, and Universal should be willing to accept a non-zero price over the zero dollars they would otherwise get.  WTB <= TIH2profit - OC  WTS >= 0  where WTB is Disney's willingness to buy Hulk distribution rights, TIH2profit is the expected value of a venture on a Hulk sequel, OC is opportunity cost, and WTS is Universal's willingness to sell the rights.  Given that Disney has not purchased the Hulk distribution rights, a rationalist would infer that Disney is pessimistic about the ROI of TIH2 or very optimistic about every future non-Hulk MCU film. A behaviorist might point out that Universal is experiencing the endowment effect and has a WTS that is too high.  Ugh. I hate it when firms don't act rationally to give me another standalone Hulk film."
marvelstudios,3d299v,andrey_b,-3,Tue Jul 14 00:32:36 2015 UTC,I think Marvel should tell Disney to back off and let Universal keep the theme park rides and give up distribution rights. Universal has a whole section dedicated to Marvel. To make that disappear ruins childhoods. I'm sure Disney can create a whole section dedicated to Avengers without the Hulk and Spider Man.
marvelstudios,3d299v,DeathFeind,13,Sun Jul 12 23:31:11 2015 UTC,Universal holds the theme park rights to all marvel characters.   Also the entire area is dirty and pretty shit tbh. I'd be happy for disney to do it justice.

Conversely, Universal cannot add or even alter any of the Marvel properties currently in their parks.  That leaves the Disneyland Resort as the only option for new Marvel attractions in the US.  Of course, there have been rumors for the past 5 years, but what has actually come to fruition so far is Marvel merchandise through Disneyland and California Adventure, themed meet & greet experiences with Captain America and Thor and a display of Iron Man suits in the Innoventions building in Disneyland, and multiple Marvel feature film previews prior to their release in the 3D theaters in both parks.  Current rumors range from a ""Marvel Studios"" mini-land in California Adventure to a reimagined meet & greet in the Innoventions building (which is currently closed, presumably to add a Star Wars meet & greet experience to the lower level).  The big problem is that there isn't a lot of room left to expand in the parks and no current plans for a third gate."

It's pretty clear they aren't planning to upgrade that, so I really hope they demolish it in favor of some Marvel stuff.  They could easily do 2 or 3 rides with that space."
marvelstudios,3d5lsx,ERagingTyrant,3,Mon Jul 13 20:46:01 2015 UTC,"While it's a huge piece of real estate and most logical, it's not that easy... half of the Autopia track is actually on top of the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage show building and the Monorail runs through/above all of Autopia."
marvelstudios,3d5lsx,theonlybrett,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:00:58 2015 UTC,"Wow. I didn't realize that about the memo ride. But even though it's not that old, there is consideration to get rid of it because underwater rides are crazy expensive to maintain. This why that ride has closed multiple times. And hopefully they could just build around the monoraill. Let it peak in on stuff anyway. Wishful thinking though I'm sure."
marvelstudios,3d5lsx,ERagingTyrant,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:53:46 2015 UTC,"Nemo just underwent a 9-month long refurbishment last year. Not a lot changed and there is speculation that it was closed so long in order to cut some costs for the year.  Disney has to consider a replacement of the subs and/or Autopia very carefully because of the Monorail. Any construction would not only close the transportation system for an interminable amount of time, but anything being built there would need to be seen as a 100%, sure fire hit before being given the green light due to costs of either re-routing the Monorail or the trick of building around it.  Personally, while I wouldn't necessarily miss the Nemo subs as an attraction, the element of nature that the lagoon brings to the area is nice and something I would miss."
marvelstudios,3d5lsx,theonlybrett,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:53:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I guess even as much as I would like to see a Marvel area, I mostly just really hate autotopia.  I was just at Disneyland and with how impressed I am with so much of Disneyland, I can't help but feel like autotopia is such a waste.  The car ride at my amusement park in Utah is more impressive.  If anyone can pull off an improvement of the area, it's Disney.  And I wouldn't mind if they kept nemo and built around it as well, though between that an the monorail, I'm starting to limit the options.  But even without the ride, I wouldn't expect them to remove the lagoon."

Portman wants out, the movies needs to have big consequences for Thor, everyone want super women to feature heavily in the MCU, most people don't like the humans in Thor anyways, and Jamie Alexander is committed (AoS cameos) and amazing.

Thats like tom hiddleston not returning cause his contract was up and loki is left out of the movie. Asgard is the location of ragnarok and there currently not that many main characters there.

marvelstudios,3d0d3n,Shadow_Gabriel,65,Sun Jul 12 14:03:14 2015 UTC,She would have been the perfect cast for Wonder Woman
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,Nemo1606,29,Sun Jul 12 14:52:04 2015 UTC,"agreed, but I'm glad we get to keep her in the MCU"
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,dra39437,7,Sun Jul 12 16:39:20 2015 UTC,Love her on AoS. Definitely going to be looking at her new NBC show
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,your_mind_aches,-13,Sun Jul 12 22:53:00 2015 UTC,I'm still not sold on Gal Gadot though and honestly I'd rather have a great Wonder Woman and mediocre Sif than the other way around.
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,CageyTurtlez,20,Sun Jul 12 18:34:20 2015 UTC,She looked badass in the new trailer. I think given how the other castings have turned out. Gadot will be just fine e
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,Try_Another_Please,2,Sun Jul 12 18:48:00 2015 UTC,Yeah. I was sceptical but the new trailer proved me completely wrong
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,your_mind_aches,2,Sun Jul 12 22:52:38 2015 UTC,"She doesn't really look the character though. Isn't Superwoman supposed to be this great Amazonian warrior?   If Ben Affleck had to bulk up for Batman, I can't see why Gadot wasn't asked to do the same."
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,SpectreFire,3,Sun Jul 12 22:07:05 2015 UTC,Superwoman? And yes she does. WW isn't super mucled in most of her incarnations which is not true for Batman. Plus her strength is magical. I mean Jaime Alexander isn't much more muscular or bulky as sif and no one complains. A bit skinnier does not equal out of shape
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,Try_Another_Please,0,Sun Jul 12 22:32:43 2015 UTC,"Nobody is saying she is out of shape. It's that WW is traditionally a bigger woman, and Godot looked like a model when she was cast."
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,mythofdob,2,Sun Jul 12 23:10:55 2015 UTC,She's not always that big. I'm just saying Jaime isn't much different than gal in the trailer and it never mattered
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,Try_Another_Please,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:13:18 2015 UTC,Big Barda is traditionally a bigger woman. Wonder Woman's isn't usually drawn to be all that big in the comics.

marvelstudios,3d0d3n,mb862,3,Sun Jul 12 20:45:27 2015 UTC,It was a first look of her. Obviously she's not the main attraction and whatever she does is likely spoilerly. The movie is called Batman vs Superman. They are getting the trailer time. I wouldn't have expected to see her much even if she's present in the whole third act.
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,Try_Another_Please,-3,Sun Jul 12 20:47:59 2015 UTC,"Given how much they spoiled in that trailer, I don't think hiding her role is a significant concern."

marvelstudios,3d0d3n,mb862,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:51:02 2015 UTC,I wonder how people from the UK feel about Thor having a British accent?
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,eusoujoaonava,5,Sun Jul 12 22:08:39 2015 UTC,It's fine for me. Asgard is quite a middle earth looking place so anything other than English accents would feel weird to me.

marvelstudios,3d0d3n,UNITBlackArchive,4,Mon Jul 13 05:36:20 2015 UTC,The accent hardly matters. Not to me at least and I've only seen her in the fast movies. Acting is not the goal of those movies. Besides actors have to have their first great role and she's not in much before this. She was cast for a reason and considering everyone else seems to be well cast I doubt they just went dead during her audition
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,Try_Another_Please,2,Sun Jul 12 20:44:44 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't Wonder Woman have an accent? You know she's not from America right?
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,suss2it,-1,Mon Jul 13 12:22:19 2015 UTC,Well historically all of her animated version spoke flawless English.

marvelstudios,3d0d3n,JuanRiveara,9,Sun Jul 12 14:52:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I think this might be case of ""Jaimie Alexander has seen the Marvel people more often"", seeing as how she's guest-starred in two AoS episodes, and I know that the Film MCU people are pretty involved whenever film characters actually appear in the TV series. By contrast, we haven't seen the W3 since The Dark World."
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,ContinuumGuy,3,Sun Jul 12 15:21:02 2015 UTC,True. On another note they should totally try to get Zachary Levi on a episode of Agents of SHIELD. He's mostly done TV work and seems to really like the character of Fandral so it seems like it would be a possibility.
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,JuanRiveara,3,Sun Jul 12 21:24:11 2015 UTC,They could bring him along the next time Sif shows up on AOS. Maybe even the other 2 warriors?
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,3,Mon Jul 13 00:58:08 2015 UTC,but what about Balder?
marvelstudios,3d0d3n,bobrasher,3,Sun Jul 12 14:40:27 2015 UTC,Basically guaranteed her and the Warrior Three will return. Also it's unfortunately basically guaranteed Darcy will return aswell.

marvelstudios,3d4pcz,the1egend1ives,-8,Mon Jul 13 15:15:35 2015 UTC,"Your point?  Anything can be weaponized.  CARS can be weaponized.  That doesn't mean you stop making them.  Heck, Scott is using it as a weapon.  Cross has a point, if it's not him, someone else is going to make a superhero suit and publicly release it.  And honestly, SHIELD could use some tools to do their job properly.  (Pym's ""chaos"" comment doesn't make much sense given that the only people who could afford them would be governments, and also that arguably chaos has already been unleashed on the world by things like Ultron).  Also, legally, it doesn't much matter if Cross bought the company.  Or developed a copy suit on his own, which the second trailer seems to suggest."
marvelstudios,3d4pcz,the1egend1ives,3,Mon Jul 13 15:25:48 2015 UTC,"In the movie, the Pym particles are regularly used by the world's greatest scientists. The concern is using it to shrink actual living beings. The question of what happens when bad guys get a hold of this technology is raised. An analogy with nuclear weapons is far more appropriate than with cars (which have limits and restrictions on them anyways.)"

A person who could shrink to the size of ant could bypass all manner of detection. Theoretically, one person could shut down an entire city's power grid, or cause the meltdown of a nuclear power plant. It's nothing to be trifled with."

marvelstudios,3d4pcz,BiggChicken,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:43:11 2015 UTC,"Not at all. But I think there is a strong case for it and is worth talking about.

marvelstudios,3d0t8t,CoherentInsanity,10,Mon Jul 13 11:45:09 2015 UTC,"Man, Avengers would have felt like a totally different movie if the final battle focused on the collateral damage. Imagine if people were still in the building that Thor uses as a lightning rod and basically fries to kill several Leviathans.   And speaking of Leviathans, Hulk for sure had to severely injure (likely permanently cripple) several people in the office that he charges through to stop the Leviathan. But then again, if he hadn't have done that, the Leviathan would have just plowed through the building, ensuring that hundreds of lives are immediately lost.  So.... you gotta pick your poison with scenarios like this. I'm in favor of the lesser evil. I'd like to believe that I'd rather have the Hulk inadvertently land me in a wheelchair for the rest of my life than have a giant metal space whale collapse the building in, KILLING ME, and all my co-workers and friends (and maybe it was bring your daughter to work day too, just to make it an absolutely worst case scenario) so...  but of course people don't always focus on the bigger picture like that, they'll only care about immediate damages."

While the MCU, lighter in tone, has many, many deaths by heroes.  Captain America would've killed hundred just in WWII. Iron Man definitely wiped out a few Ten Rings bases. Thor probably hasn't killed any humans but he has killed many Frost Giants.   To be honest, I prefer it. Sticking to a 'no-killing' rule adds constraints to already fairly convoluted stories, especially in the 2hr timespan of an average movie."

marvelstudios,3d0t8t,RedBarrel,16,Sun Jul 12 21:14:29 2015 UTC,"There's a couple of Easter eggs in DareDevil that references Avengers 1 and the Hulk. In Urich's office, there's two newspaper clipping where one of them says, ""Battle of New York, hundreds killed.""  There's also another one that's in favor of Hulk that says, ""Harlem Terror, Hulk emerges victorious."" But alliances aside, the Hulk is obviously associated with destruction.   So there's no direction confirmation but the Avengers 1 didn't really show much people dying but in reality hundreds were in fact killed. So it makes it likely that Hulk has killed quite a few.  http://i.imgur.com/IkMPnci.jpg"

Daredevil can usually sense him coming, and because the Punisher will never shoot Matt it escalates into a meelee where Daredevil has the undisputed advantage.  That said Punisher is obsessively thorough and would never kill someone until he understood all the angles. He spends days planning hits on organized crime, and has exhaustively researched nearly every aspect of their operations before engaging. It's the only reason he's still alive."
marvelstudios,3d1j4k,Dray_Gunn,2,Sun Jul 12 21:41:21 2015 UTC,My only exposure to The Punisher is the 2004 movie. I always enjoyed the movie but knew he was a bit harsher than that in the comics. I am looking forward to seeing how they portray him in DareDevil.
marvelstudios,3d1j4k,youmonsterikill,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:46:28 2015 UTC,Like most comic characters Punisher is a slave to his writers. He can change drastically depending on who's portraying him. In general the 2004 is considered much more humanized then most iterations of the character. But the tactics and planning as displayed in the film I feel are pretty accurate to the character.  I'm also excited for season 2. They really have the potential to give us the best portrayals of Punisher and Elektra we've ever seen.
marvelstudios,3d1j4k,starlorde,0,Mon Jul 13 11:36:25 2015 UTC,And if I'm the writer..he's a bit street-smart but dumb jock-ish. I'm really excited to see what they do on Netflix cause I have so much faith they're gonna do an amazing job. His character is made for a longer series. Too much meat for a 2 hour movie.

marvelstudios,3d1j4k,Maxenin,4,Mon Jul 13 01:47:43 2015 UTC,"Kinda funny. They had good production values all things considering. I feel like there is a lot more comedy that could have been milked from this interaction. Frank and Matt are like the Odd Couple of Hell's Kitchen, Matt's trying to clean up Hell's Kitchen and Frank keeps leaving his bodies everywhere. Frank is trying to shut the revolving door of the justice system but Matt's been stuck circling for hours, wondering why this hall way won't end."
marvelstudios,3d1j4k,Maxenin,0,Sun Jul 12 20:54:59 2015 UTC,Thanks. We spent about $100 on this short cause the costumes are pretty straightforward actually. One night shoot. Wish we coulda done more but people don't wanna watch stuff over 3 minutes.
marvelstudios,3d1j4k,DeathFeind,2,Mon Jul 13 01:45:41 2015 UTC,"If you had the opportunity, I would sit down and come up with about a dozen short interactions. Crowdsource it even by just asking people what funny Punisher and Daredevil interactions they'd be interested in seeing. Garth Ennis' has some funny stuff, (Very pro-Punisher though) if you check out 'Confederacy of Dunces"" it's basically Spider-Man and Daredevil trying to bring the Punisher in. You guys could probably film a bunch of really short stuff and then edit it into short video with a lot of content.  It's a lot of work I know, but I would definitely watch more."

Ultimately, it's hearsay. I obviously don't know if Snipes is being honest or is correct, but random dude on internet and a few actors in the film, who are unlikely to appear in future installments, don't take precedence over an actor that has starred in every single blade film."
marvelstudios,3czl49,ElpisofChaos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:58:41 2015 UTC,"The whole point is, he has such a small chance of coming back. While he may have been made for the role, it doesn't defeat the fact that Marvel doesn't like to have people connect non-canon movies with the canon movies. Having Snipes be blade would basically mean the first 3 Blade movies were canon, and after the tragedy that was Blade Trinity, I doubt they'd want that."

marvelstudios,3czl49,youmonsterikill,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:57:47 2015 UTC,Yup that's exactly what is happening.  I think the closest he's gotten to talking to Marvel about it would be him harassing them to let him play the part (in a movie they're not even planning on making to boot).  They likely won't talk to him about it so he's starting a rumor hoping fans will pressure Marvel to make the movie.

marvelstudios,3czl49,UmbrusNightshade,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:12:41 2015 UTC,"I don't see how they could even attempt to explain vampires even a slight scientific way (which regardless of what you all think they are trying to do with pretty much everything in the MCU ... like Dr. Strange's ""powers"" are supposed to be tied to quantum mechanics and multiple-worlds theory). The ONLY way I could see a scientific explanation for vampires is if they went the route where it is said to be caused by whatever mental disorder makes some in real life think that they are vampires (and they maybe could tie it into Darkforce or Dark Matter or something, but I doubt it).   That said, if they did just go the whole supernatural route with little to no scientific explanation, I think Blade should be rebooted and the original films should be excluded from the MCU. They were fun at the time and did help set the groundwork for the MCU, but they wouldn't fit I don't think. If you're gonna keep Snipes (which I don't really like, but could live with) then fine, but make this Blade new and give him a stronger connection to the MCU as a whole."
marvelstudios,3czl49,Clay8288314,2,Sun Jul 12 19:22:55 2015 UTC,The source of vampirism could be biological in nature
marvelstudios,3czl49,UmbrusNightshade,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:55:16 2015 UTC,"True. The only route I could see plausible in that nature would be that the ""vampire"" suffers from a rare form of iron deficiency which is why they feast on blood. It could also have something to do with blood plasma, I guess."
marvelstudios,3czl49,ConnerBartle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:41:27 2015 UTC,We've seen some weird shit. I think the MCU could have a supernatural element. One thats not explained away with science.

Everything we've seen has had at least a minor connection to science or scientific theory."

marvelstudios,3czl49,DanMorgan405,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:02:30 2015 UTC,Everything we've seen has had at least a minor connection to science or scientific theory.   Like the infinity gems or a hammer that can fly and is only picked up by certain people?  There are a lot of things that are not rooted in science throughout the MCU.    I completely disagree. Everything should have some type of scientific explanation even if it is minor.   You are really closing the door on a lot of things here. They are comic book movies.
marvelstudios,3czl49,mrthewhite,2,Mon Jul 13 16:25:02 2015 UTC,"To add to your point, we're about to get an entire movie based on magic (Doctor Strange) so Marvel is clearly open to the idea of mysticism."
marvelstudios,3czl49,UmbrusNightshade,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:01:24 2015 UTC,"First, the gems do have scientific qualities. They are likely made out of dark matter or exotic matter and they are connected in some ways to quantum mechanics, quantum physics, and quantum entaglement. They can be somewhat qualitatively described because the Power Stone cannot, for example ... at least as we've seen ... cause things to teleport like the Space Stone. So there are at the very core basic scientific things we can apply to the stones. Secondly, the hammer DOES NOT fly. It is established in the comic books and the films as well that Thor throws the hammer and holds onto it to appear to ""fly"".   Everything in the MCU to this point has SOME scientific explanation even if it is only theory rather than law.   I'm not closing the door to anything. I firmly believe that the reason that the MCU has done so well is because of it's basis in a more scientific approach to the universe rather than going with the old ""it's a comic book movie"" approach used prior to the MCU. General non-comic book audience fans ARE NOT as excepting as comic book readers. Their ability to ""suspend disbelief"" isn't as strong and so the more you can ground things the better they can handle the fiction. I've spoken to tons of such people and they are always the first to point out ""comic book logic"" as asinine and stupid because they say it ""makes no sense"".   Marvel should do their best to tell engaging stories while not just simply going ""It's a comic book movie"". That attitude will only hasten the inevitable ""comic book/superhero movie fatigue""."
marvelstudios,3czl49,merelyadoptedthedark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:02:31 2015 UTC,It was explained scientifically in the movies.   They fit in as well with the current universe as Daredevil does.
marvelstudios,3czl49,UmbrusNightshade,-1,Mon Jul 13 13:02:27 2015 UTC,"They tried to explain in with science, but it came across as contrived. They could do a better job of it. And the Daredevil film has NO place in the MCU."
marvelstudios,3czl49,merelyadoptedthedark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:11:36 2015 UTC,I meant the current Daredevil Netflix series. Not sure why you would think I meant the 12 year old movie that is on nobody's mind.  Both are low level underground events that would have no bearing on what is happening on a planetary or cosmic level.  There is virtually nothing in Blade that would make it incompatible with the current MCU.  Their explanation of vampirism as a virus is just as sound as any other pseudo science explanations in the current slate of MCU movies.
marvelstudios,3czl49,UmbrusNightshade,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:46:37 2015 UTC,"That's where you are wrong though. They will have impact on events in the future. Feige recently stated that it is likely that in the future the shows will impact the films.  And I'm not totally against Blade being the MCU, but like I said it needs a grounded, scientific approach to them. Also, I would rather Snipes not reprise the role (I'm of the camp that feels that people who have been in other non-MCU Marvel films should not reprise their roles), but if he did I want it to be a ""new MCU"" version of the character rather than ""forcing in"" the Blade from his original films. I firmly believe the original films don't work with the MCU. They are ""too comic booky"" even for the MCU."

marvelstudios,3czl49,Worthyness,2,Sun Jul 12 16:59:05 2015 UTC,"Can make him a significantly older version of Blade for whatever reason. For what it's worth, Snipes looks pretty good for how old he is."
marvelstudios,3czl49,mrthewhite,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:57:16 2015 UTC,"He does but consider he'd be around 55 before the first movie releases (or maybe even starts shooting) and Marvel is in the franchise business and would likely be looking for someone who could do 3+ Blade movies.  Now consider it took marvel 5-6 years to make 3 movies when they didn't have that many on the slate, now their slate is packed full of new titles and it'll likely take close to 10 years to get 3 movies out.  That would make him 60-65 making Blade movies.  Add to that the fact that they'd have to reboot the narrative because Marvel doesn't own the first 3 Blade movies (new line owns them) and I can't think of a single franchise reboot that kept the main star from the original franchise.  Oh and then read up on his behavior during Blade: Trinity and see why Marvel employees would likely not want to work with him either, even if the studio wanted him."

marvelstudios,3cxmh6,Tom-ocil,57,Sat Jul 11 18:13:34 2015 UTC,I think little things like this would flesh out the universe so much and it doesn't seem to be too expensive. One can only hope i guess.
marvelstudios,3cxmh6,ConnerBartle,27,Sat Jul 11 21:18:06 2015 UTC,"I think it would be great if he was in the film defending a previously unseen superhero and they never even directly address who he is. This would be very inline with Marvel's style of including some stuff for the diehard fans without confusing or distorting the narrative for general audiences.   It serves two purposes,  I. It establishes that there are other people affected by this in the MCU, which is crucial for justifying the point of having a 'Civil War' over legislation. If it only affects a handful of people it would be kind of selfish and ridiculous to build a movement around it.  II. It ties Daredevil to the MCU in a more  concrete way opening for potential future involvement.  It's a great way to introduce the character to audiences in a minor way, without compromising any of Civil Wars story, without confusing audiences, without taking much if any screen time away from Captain America. It'd be crazy not to do it."
marvelstudios,3cxmh6,youmonsterikill,4,Sat Jul 11 22:40:31 2015 UTC,I'd like to see a Captain America dream team of defense lawyers.    Matt Murdock and SheHulk  defending fugitive from justice Steve Rodgers.    Honestly I would watch a Law&Order type show with Superheros
marvelstudios,3cxmh6,abraksis747,4,Sun Jul 12 04:03:33 2015 UTC,"A few months ago, She Hulk was the defense attorney for Steve against Matt acting as prosecutor."
marvelstudios,3cxmh6,Friendly_B,5,Sun Jul 12 13:47:04 2015 UTC,"It'd be nice to get these little one shots to flesh out the universe more, but I think they stopped when Marvel started doing TV because they assumed SHIELD would be their medium to flesh out the universe. Turns out it just adds more to the universe, not fleshes out previously existing parts of the universe. It would be nice to see these characters crossover like that more. Because beyond the odd reference or single episode crossover, you could say they took place in other universes. Sure in Daredevil they mention Iron Man, but we don't see the movies reference the TV shows. You think the Avengers would be more aware of Daredevil, given Avengers Tower and the New Avengers Facility are both in New York. You think they'd hear ""oh yea someone blew up half of Hell's Kitchen and there's a masked vigilante running around."" The lack of crossover is personally for me, the most disappointing portion of the MCU (besides the lack of a Moon Knight Netflix Series). The TV and movie series seem far too unrelated. The biggest relation we got was with Winter Soldier CHANGING EVERYTHING on Agents of SHIELD. Perhaps could see Strange show up somewhere, as Cumberbatch is a TV actor and movie actor who would be more open to cameo-ing on TV for a smaller paycheck than say Robert Downey Jr?   Or perhaps it gives us an opportunity to introduce Spider-Man villains in a way that doesn't rush them. Think of how they developed Absorbing Man, but with lesser Spider-Man villains like Rhino, Vulture, Scorpion, Shocker, Sandman, etc. If they expect the Sinister Six to ever exist, they need to find a way to introduce each character individually and not rush them (cough Amazing Spider-Man 2 cough). I doubt they'll wait 6 movies to put the Sinister Six together. So here's what they do: Introduce Green Goblin in Spider-Man: The Next Avenger, introduce Doctor Octopus/Mysterio in Spider-Man 2, introduce Kraven the Hunter in a Tigra movie (hey, he's a hunter....she's a tiger...it could work), then introduce Vulture, Sandman, and Electro in a crossover with TV. Have Tom Holland come help SHIELD fight Vulture after he steals a flight suit from them, help battle Electro with the help of Daredevil or Iron Fist, or have Sandman terrorize the New York slums, having Luke Cage come in and fight him with Spider-Man. Then they can make Spider-Man 3 Doctor Octopus/Mysterio. Boom, Spider-Man 4 has him fighting the Sinister Six!"
marvelstudios,3cxmh6,FPSGamer48,5,Sun Jul 12 21:20:59 2015 UTC,Is it confirmed that Daredevil will be in Civil War?
marvelstudios,3cxmh6,Afroanater,18,Sat Jul 11 21:42:33 2015 UTC,"No, and I don't think he will be. The script was being written way before the show was a success, which is why I think something like a Blu-Ray one shot could actually be viable."

marvelstudios,3cxff9,youmonsterikill,20,Sat Jul 11 17:35:55 2015 UTC,I think the method for these shows will be to introduce all the heroes with their gifts and then flashback when appropriate. I imagine we will get to see some of Luke Cage's origin in his own show and considering it's never been put to film this is one origin I'm actually really curious to see how it is done.  This is what they did with Daredevil and it worked really well. Start them all off at the beginning of their superhero careers and then show little bits of the origin as they go. It's nice because they can keep going back to that well forever without actually exhausting the material like they would if they started off with the origin again.

And the less said about the MAX series Luke Cage the better...  But anyway, I started appreciating him being the everyman and down-to-earth hero in the whole Marvel canon. Especially as the threats kept escalating and the stupid inter-hero strife that kept going, and then you have him there and it's like he remembers what the point of being a hero is - save the normal guys who can't stop the bad shit that keeps happening in the Marvel universe.  That's my impression anyway. I love that him and his team kept fighting the good fight right until the bitter end just before the final Incursion.

marvelstudios,3cxff9,SwagBelow,8,Sat Jul 11 22:40:41 2015 UTC,He has unbreakable skin.  But he shouldn't be anywhere near Thor
marvelstudios,3cxff9,JuanRiveara,2,Sun Jul 12 00:53:49 2015 UTC,I feel Luke should be weaker than Thor but should be at least able to fight on par like be able to take lighting strikes from Thor's Hammer. I think his unbreakable skin should give him an edge against most oppents in the MCU. Like being able to fight 90% of the MCU.
marvelstudios,3cxff9,JuanRiveara,6,Sun Jul 12 01:11:42 2015 UTC,There was one comic where he went against Hulk and was doing pretty good.
marvelstudios,3cxff9,JuanRiveara,5,Sun Jul 12 01:22:40 2015 UTC,I am not surprised about that. I feel he will be one of the stronger heroes of the MCU. He also fought Namor in AvX so I think if were to fight against anyone with super strength he would be good.

marvelstudios,3cxff9,jabrd,2,Sun Jul 12 04:38:23 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I mean why make him weak and nerf his powers when that is what he is known for.

marvelstudios,3cxff9,soulbreaker1418,0,Sun Jul 12 05:47:57 2015 UTC,"1) They are all going to become the Defenders, they need to be around the same power level  2) Your thought about DD doesnt make any logical sense at all  3) Prepare to be disappointed i guess"
marvelstudios,3cxff9,Hickspy,3,Sun Jul 12 05:55:32 2015 UTC,The Avengers or Guardians don't have the same power levels. I mean Groot and Hulk are the strongest ones on the team  and my point about Daredevil is that he has super senses which is a power that is useful by not OP in fighting and the show had to portray him as having to stuggle to become a hero. Unbreakable skin and super strenth are something completely different. They will have to show what makes him a unique character and his powers do that.
marvelstudios,3cxff9,Tebeku,2,Sun Jul 12 06:20:20 2015 UTC,"Gamora and Drax were massively down powered and Groot is extremely limited in general. They are on the same power level and a again, he wont be as strong as you think."
marvelstudios,3cxff9,jabrd,3,Sun Jul 12 06:23:25 2015 UTC,If Batroc can stand up against Cap I'm Luke Cage could hold his own.
marvelstudios,3czhr9,bflaminio,34,Sun Jul 12 04:52:10 2015 UTC,"Well... In addition to that, all of the backstories to the main 5 characters are pretty tragic.   Starlord lost his only remaining parent (that he knew of) and then got abducted and was forced to live a life of a mercenary/space pirate. Obviously still has tons of mental issues considering how he uses comedy as a defense mechanism, and after all these years, he hadn't finished grieving his dead mother. Rocket. Don't really even have to say much. He was taken out of his natural habitat and experimented on. Most likely in a torturous way because he's ""vermin"". Who cares how vermin feels, right? We'll just put it to death after we're done with it. :( :( :( Groot is the last of his people. I don't think you can get anymore depressing than that. Drax lost his entire family to Ronin and then got jailed for what was supposed to be an eternity in an inescapable prison.  Gamora was forced into accepting the man who destroyed her life as her ""father"" and endure his ""love"" as his favorite child. And I'm fairly certain Thanos is not a kindly father who reads you bedtime stories at night and calms you after a nightmare.    Let's also not forget that entire planets and races have been destroyed up to the point of the movie. Shit tons of people want to kill Gamora because of that when she's in the prison. Plus, the Kree/Nova war had gone on for a reaaaaaaally long time before they JUST made this truce. Imagine how many Kree and Novarian (sp?) have died before this.   Essentially, I found that the comedy in GotG was absolutely necessary or else it would be a depressing as fuck movie."
marvelstudios,3czhr9,eiggam,9,Sun Jul 12 05:52:20 2015 UTC,Thanos wasn't all bad. I sincerely hope we'll get this kind of insight in GotG2 or the IW movies.
marvelstudios,3czhr9,Jackal_6,6,Sun Jul 12 13:31:20 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on how MCU wants to take him. I just imagine that he's probably not the best for a traumatized kid and if she really was the favorite child, then the other ""children"" are very likely to want to take her down for that spot. We saw the disdain Nebula had for her and she was the one closest to Gamora.  Considering how MCU has taken GotG in a much different way than what they were in the comics (for the most part) I'd rather not rely on what comic versions are like because I don't think they'd follow the original characters too closely."
marvelstudios,3czhr9,eiggam,2,Sun Jul 12 14:09:49 2015 UTC,"I hope we see more character development into Thanos so he's not that big bad guy that he is currently being deceived. We might see more of it when Death comes into play, referenced in The Avengers mid-credit scenes"

marvelstudios,3czhr9,hindukid,17,Sun Jul 12 17:03:00 2015 UTC,I had recently lost my mother when I watched that movie and that part in the beginning when he lost his mother really stung me too. Lots of old memories coming back all at once.
marvelstudios,3czhr9,RichardLewis606,11,Sun Jul 12 05:12:07 2015 UTC,To me rocket was the saddest part. Nothing else in the film made me feel even half as sad as when Rocket had his drunken meltdown.
marvelstudios,3czhr9,mwriteword,4,Sun Jul 12 05:57:43 2015 UTC,"Also, when Rocket mentioned to Quill that he escaped prison many times (I don't know the exact quote), he meant the prison where he was subject to biological experimentation."

Say what you will about the BvS trailer or SS trailer or Deadpool trailer, it was a pretty safe bet we were going to get a look at all of those."
marvelstudios,3d1039,SToddB33,3,Mon Jul 13 05:42:17 2015 UTC,"Not for me atleast. A trailer for a movie that we know is actually getting made, is much more exciting than a company revealing a hypothetic slate, that might not even come out the way they announce it (I'm looking at you Spider-Man). There's no guarantee that Green Lantern Corps will actually reach theatres, but BvS certainly will, and right now I'm more excited for that than Infinity War. Part of the reason is that IW is way off in the future to me."

marvelstudios,3czair,Jeppo3,64,Sun Jul 12 03:33:19 2015 UTC,"This is the best explanation I've seen thus far:  Cap is worthy, but since he tried to lift it to ""show off"", and not in a time in need, Mjlonir sensed this and deemed him not worthy, only in that situation. It budged to show that he can be worthy, just not at that moment."
marvelstudios,3czair,FuckMeRunning5648,20,Sun Jul 12 03:38:46 2015 UTC,"In 2003/2004 there was a comic called JLA/Avengers written by Kurt Busiek. (This isn't the series from the 90's where superheroes fought and won based on fan votes)  In this series, Superman picked up Mjolnir and used it to fight in the final battle. After everything was over, he tried to pick up the hammer to hand back to Thor and was unable to move it.   Now, this is obviously non-canon and Kurt Busiek isn't the ""end all be all"" Thor writer. But Kurt Busiek discussed his logic for the hammer in an online Superman forum.    I don't think we ever said either way whether he'd be generally worthy or generally unworthy -- just that he was worthy once, and not worthy shortly thereafter -- and admittedly, picking up the hammer to return it to Thor isn't an inherently worthy purpose, not when there's no danger and he's standing right there.  The reason we did that bit was because neither Tom Brevoort nor I liked the long, long list of people who'd lifted the hammer over the years, so we wanted to introduce the idea that ""worthiness"" is not steady-state, it varies according to circumstances and purpose, as well as the character's worth, by whatever Asgardian standards the hammer's spell recognizes as worth.  Just because someone picked it up once -- or twice, or a dozen times -- does not mean they'll always be able to do it.  As for what exact parameters factor into things, I don't think it should ever be fully spelled out -- the hammer is godly and mythic, and there should be an air of mystery about it to some degree.  It's not a science-fiction weapon whose workings are mathematically transparent to human minds, so you could say, ""Well, so-and-so saved a busload of children in 1968, so therefore he can lift it.""  The only way to know is to try it and see.  And then the only way to know if you can do it again is to try it and see again.  That would go for everyone, not just Superman (including pre-Crisis Supes, Earth-2 Supes, Kingdom Come Supes, Twinkie-ad Supes or any other).  I think the only guy who the reader should expect can always lift Mjolnir is Thor, and I'm not opposed to surprising them there, either.   I've always liked this approach to Thor's hammer and to me, it explains the party scene. I don't like the ""Cap didn't want to embarrass Thor"" explanation. Like I said, this comic isn't canon and it's not a ""what this author says goes!"" author. But it's still an industry veteran explaining his logic and I happen to agree with it.   Source"
marvelstudios,3czair,TheHoundThatRides,4,Sun Jul 12 06:12:50 2015 UTC,I guess you can explain Vision picking it up and handing it to Thor is like how an elevator can lift the hammer then.
marvelstudios,3czair,JuanRiveara,6,Sun Jul 12 06:27:14 2015 UTC,Well he lifted the hammer to show everybody he was trustworthy (and to save Thor later on) so I think he had good reasons.
marvelstudios,3czair,TheHoundThatRides,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:34:24 2015 UTC,"I guess that's true, I just thought it was funny that the example the writer brought up was practically what happened with Vision."
marvelstudios,3czair,JuanRiveara,2,Sun Jul 12 06:39:22 2015 UTC,"That was a pleasant read! Never really read to much about the worthiness of lifting miljnor, and that explains it very nicely. I like how they acknowledge the hammer being godly and magical, so there can be that bit of mystery in what determines 'worthiness'."
marvelstudios,3czair,FuckMeRunning5648,8,Sun Jul 12 09:03:02 2015 UTC,"Yup. Cap's most likely going to be ""worthy"" in Infinity War when they're battling against Thanos with everyone else is knocked out and him being the only one left standing."

marvelstudios,3czair,Durk2392,2,Mon Jul 13 16:31:20 2015 UTC,you could argue Thor was showing off too.
marvelstudios,3czair,jdyake,16,Sun Jul 12 18:32:38 2015 UTC,"A quick note on ""Cap is more worthy than Thor"": I've seen a post explaining this better elsewhere, but as far as my head-canon, ""worthy"" is explicitly defined by how Odin would define ""worth,"" not by some scale of morality or righteousness. In particular, ""worth"" is about the attributes which are required for the ideal warrior king, a person who can lead a people into battle but also make the right decisions while on the throne. While Cap is a good warrior, and an excellent leader of a squad in battle, he may not be able to make the kinds of big-picture decisions and hard choices (such as sacrificing the few to save the many -- in particular, sacrificing others to save the many) necessary to be a king. So in terms of worthiness, Cap could easily be a trusted adviser and brother-in-arms to a warrior king, but he could not be one himself. Therefore he is close enough to ""worthy"" to budge the hammer, but not worthy enough to lift it."
marvelstudios,3czair,trimeta,8,Sun Jul 12 04:59:49 2015 UTC,"This is the basic gist I like the most, and here's the kicker for it: It's payed off IN AoU. Cap won't make the tough call to kill thousands to save the entire planet. It pays off for him, sure they end up saving everyone, but not even Iron Man thought that was possible.  Cap hasn't been able to make the hardest decisions yet. He'll lay himself down on the line, but he can't moralize the few for the many, he's still too idealistic; unlike Thor, who swoops in and is like ""woah bros, I know, AI is dangerous, but lemme energize this possibly dangerous robot cause we kind of gotta""."
marvelstudios,3czair,Islero47,5,Sun Jul 12 06:07:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ""curse"" that Odin puts on Mjolnir is just about if he be worthy not if he be a moral upstanding citizen. Odin's views of worthiness might not have much of anything to do with Cap."
marvelstudios,3czair,VonAether,5,Sun Jul 12 05:21:45 2015 UTC,This is how I view it. Asgardian values are different from Earthly values. What makes Cap a good man in our eyes may not suffice for what Thor needs to be a good king.
marvelstudios,3czair,AlleyOopToym,11,Sun Jul 12 15:15:41 2015 UTC,"OP, how can you spell Mjolnir correctly, but not Rogers?"
marvelstudios,3czair,TurkCLE,11,Sun Jul 12 07:00:10 2015 UTC,"Hubris, I suppose."
marvelstudios,3czair,byakko,5,Sun Jul 12 10:02:06 2015 UTC,"Saw this explanation about how the MCU Mjolnir probably works: ""Everyone's overthinking the worthy of the hammer thing""  Key points:   The hammer is a blunt weapon It appreciates similar blunt qualities in its user: Using the hammer to smite evil in the most direct sense Thor is a very simple and direct man - he protects the innocent, do good, smite evil. That makes him Thor. That makes him worthy. Vision also has a very direct and focused reason for what he is doing - Stop Ultron. Ultron is bad. We have to kill Ultron and we have to do it now.   Basically the hammer reacts to wielders that only want to do good by smiting, and only that.  Every other Avenger has some kind of inherent flaw, because they are normal people and that's who they are. Thor is a living mythological figure. Even ignoring the metaphysical aspect that the comics Thor has (where he has no choice but to fulfill his role in the grand Norse story), Thor has spent eons being who he is, and who he is, is a simple man with a clear goal that boils down to 'do good, smite evil'.  Vision likewise has no ulterior motives. He grasps his entire reason for being and acts on it. The hammer reacts to that.  Pick any other Avenger, and there's potential for corruption. Tony, using the example given, could think about tapping Mjolnir's storm powers to provide energy for the world; a 'good' goal but not what the hammer is made for. And so Tony is not 'worthy'.  Rogers has issues as well. Just the concept of his creation and purpose - he has the issue of being almost a politicized figure just with his name and costume, of being a man out of time, the issue with Bucky, and all his other personal demons. I think confidence plays a part in here. Thor and Vision have pure confidence in their abilities and purpose, maybe born out of ignorance and an uncomplicated outlook on life, but Cap doesn't.  The hammer just wants to be wielded by a user just as blunt and honest as it is."
marvelstudios,3czair,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,2,Sun Jul 12 07:32:36 2015 UTC,"I think that the hammer moved at all proves he is worthy, and it just wasn't the right moment of Steve somehow was incapable through his modesty and self doubt rather than a lack of worthiness."
marvelstudios,3czair,UmbrusNightshade,5,Mon Jul 13 14:16:38 2015 UTC,"First off I'm gonna say that this is a hotly debated subject. I'm gonna go with my personal stance on it.   There is no such thing as being ""kind worthy"". There is only worthy or unworthy. It budged because Cap is worthy. Rogers is worthy.  Roger did pretend to not be able to lift it. I believe that he was able to lift it ... and realized this when he first tried. Because he didn't want to show up Thor he pretended to not be able to lift Mjolnir.    That's the stance I take. Others will say that there is scale to how worthy you can be (which makes no sense at all to me; you are either worthy or unworthy)."
marvelstudios,3czair,autojourno,6,Sun Jul 12 03:37:55 2015 UTC,"This.  If you watch the scene, he initially starts to lift it, it wiggles, he releases his grip, then re-grips it and struggles to move it.  The release is the key.  I think he was shocked that it budged, and immediately let go, then did the mental calculation of how much trouble it could cause for him to lift it, and re-gripped it in order to fake straining at it and failing."
marvelstudios,3czair,UmbrusNightshade,0,Sun Jul 12 04:39:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I see no point in the ""you can be worthy but your motive may not be"" theory."
marvelstudios,3czair,BirthdayStrangler,7,Sun Jul 12 04:43:03 2015 UTC,Well Thor went from being unworthy to worthy depending on his motives in the first Thor movie.
marvelstudios,3czair,UmbrusNightshade,3,Sun Jul 12 06:37:21 2015 UTC,"That is different though. Thor's entire lifestyle is why he was made unworthy. It wasn't just one thing or one motive. Plus, you could argue that the ONLY reason he became unworthy was because his father, Odin, said he was. Mjolnir continued to be liftable by him UNTIL Odin declared him unworthy (which to me says that Odin was overriding the ""worthiness detector"")."
marvelstudios,3czair,Serapius,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:07:22 2015 UTC,"It's been a little while since I've watched the first Thor movie, but I thought it didn't have that ""Worthiness Clause"" until AFTER Odin took Mjolnir from Thor and sent it to Earth?"
marvelstudios,3czair,UmbrusNightshade,2,Mon Jul 13 22:03:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I too haven't seen it in a long time, so you may be right. But that is possible because I can't rightly remember (and unfortunately I don't own it so I can't check)."
marvelstudios,3czair,009reloaded,0,Mon Jul 13 22:51:07 2015 UTC,Y'all are reading into this way too much. It's just a tease towards Cap being able to lift the hammer at some point. It doesn't need an explanation.

marvelstudios,3cxiiu,Ikouze,84,Sat Jul 11 17:39:14 2015 UTC,"I don't usually agree with these type of things but I think I agree on this. It might be why TWS and Daredevil are my favorite Marvel productions. Don't get me wrong though, I do like a joke here and there just not so many."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,_devilofhellskitchen,24,Sat Jul 11 17:53:06 2015 UTC,"TWS was subtle in its humor.  ""Air-conditioning is fully functional."""
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,polishingcheekbones,6,Sun Jul 12 13:02:45 2015 UTC,"I had the opposite reaction -- I was watching a episodes of Daredevil and Agents of SHIELD, and after the sheer seriousness of DD, the bits of levity in AoS were a welcome relief.  Not that I want the MCU to be a complete joke-fest, but I do find the lack of humor to make things more of a trudge."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,rjung,10,Sun Jul 12 05:31:24 2015 UTC,"I think that's a good thing though, we have the serious side and the lighter side to balance each other out."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,_devilofhellskitchen,101,Sun Jul 12 10:56:06 2015 UTC,"The Iron Man trilogy did humor good.  It flowed real well and did't take you away from the story.  Whedon's humor was just a bit over the top.  It had its moments though, such as Thor's report on the Hulk.  What I don't get is why is Black Widow delivering more quips than Hawkeye?  That doesn't make any sense.  Not everybody needs to be funny in Avengers movies."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,Mike5482,40,Sat Jul 11 18:09:57 2015 UTC,"Black Widow has always been kind of wry in the MCU - that doesn't bother me so much. I think Ultron could have scaled back the humor a bit, but some good moments did come from that."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,WamBamsWorld,37,Sat Jul 11 21:12:40 2015 UTC,"In defence if Ultron's humor, I feel like there was a big subplot concerning how much Tony was in Ultron. EDIT: I had intended to mention that I imagine much of the exposition on this was left on the cutting room floor. A shame."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,NateCorran,27,Sat Jul 11 22:37:25 2015 UTC,"HUGE, obvious subplot. Frequently missed/ignored just like the people who gripe about Tony's suits being destroyed in Iron Man 3 when he clearly states "" I am Ironman"" at the end."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,Maydietoday,21,Sun Jul 12 00:10:27 2015 UTC,I think the problem was the trailers.  People would have been more open to him being comedic had he not been built up as an actual sinister villain.
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,CarbonCreed,15,Sun Jul 12 03:05:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I want Ultron to be like the evil anti-Tony, not the evil version of Tony."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,NorrisOBE,2,Sun Jul 12 04:57:23 2015 UTC,Except the trailer made him sound like your typical generic Marvel baddie. I could just as well have heard Ultron's voice coming from Ronan or Malekith
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,the1egend1ives,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:21:30 2015 UTC,"But Joss stated early on that Ultron would be more comedic. Can't find a source, though, cuz I'm on mobile."

marvelstudios,3cxiiu,Emyd,17,Sun Jul 12 04:29:22 2015 UTC,"I think the amount of quips from Ultron has been greatly exaggerated on this sub, for reasons I know nothing of. The times when humor was used, it defined his character. It either demonstrated his likeness to Stark, or demonstrated his apathy towards life in general. (when he ripped Klau's arm off and was so nonchalant about it.)  It's funny, I seem to remember a ton of intensity from Ultron.... that nobody else saw. Like the scene with the twins at the church, or at the party, or when he was alone with Natasha, or his speech to the Avengers in Sokovia."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,the1egend1ives,11,Sat Jul 11 23:34:31 2015 UTC,This sub? go over to r/movies.. they act like ultron was a comedy character and not a villain. I mean he had some funny lines that partially cause of stark. other than that some lines he had were straight up spine-chilling.
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,hindukid,3,Sun Jul 12 00:53:27 2015 UTC,"People here are acting like Ultron was delivering one-liners and jokes. I don't remember any of that. But somehow it's ok if he talks like a generic villian(""how could the Avengers possibly stop me"")."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,CaptainDawn,13,Sun Jul 12 01:00:41 2015 UTC,i think that's because almost all of the most tense moments involved Ultron were dissolved with a joke. Happened at least two or three times.
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,E-Miles,7,Sun Jul 12 01:26:32 2015 UTC,"The ""Oh, come on!"" line when he was thrown out of the jet by the Hulk particularly left a bad taste in my mouth.  It was funny in the first Avengers, here it just feels out of place and cheap."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,CarbonCreed,3,Sun Jul 12 03:07:21 2015 UTC,"that's the exact one i was thinking about, felt so played out"
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,E-Miles,3,Sun Jul 12 03:08:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think the moments of levity from Ultron dissolve the intensity of Spader's performance. The humor helps to alleviate the feeling of self-importance and stops Ultron from becoming overly preachy. That's the beauty of the Marvel formula....that it doesn't take itself too seriously. I hate bringing up DC, but I just saw the new BvS trailer and that looked eye-rollingly pretentious."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,the1egend1ives,6,Sun Jul 12 15:41:24 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I'm wasting my time by saying this, but I had no complaints about the moment when Ultron says ""Oh for God's sake!"" Maybe if he had said something utterly ridiculous like ""WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH AIRLINE FOOD!?"", I could understand the concern. But as it stands, the final cut of that scene features a quip so minor and so inconsequential that complaining about it is nothing more than plain, ol' fashioned nitpicking. If Ultron didn't say ANYTHING at all, it still would have been enough to arouse a slight chuckle, because anything that is on the receiving end of a Hulk Smash is going to be so hopelessly screwed that it's funny. It can't be helped.   ...and before you say that Hulk didn't need to throw Ultron at that exact moment, it had to be done to set up Wanda's revenge, while the death of Quicksilver was still fresh.   Speaking of which, the movie dwells on Quicksilver's death for a good minute before Ultron gets tossed. Then it continues on for a solid minute and half afterwards. THEN....the tension gets even HIGHER as the last Ultron bot turns the key and drops Sokovia, leaving the entire human race in peril as we wonder if Thor and Iron Man will be enough to stop this giant rock heading towards Earth at several hundred miles per hour. Meanwhile Wanda is still in the city, and we wonder if she will be able to survive this whole ordeal, but Behold! The Vision! This whole scene was so beautifully shot. Probably my favorite moment in the entire MCU.   And yet, I haven't even begun to discuss all the other glorious moments during the battle on Sokovia.... like Ultron's speech to the Avengers about inevitability, or Hawkeye pep-talking Wanda, or Cap and Widow facing the possibility of having to sacrifice the few for the many. These are some of the tensest moments witnessed out of the entire MCU... and ending with some of the most dramatic moments.   Hulk decides to leave humanity alone forever, and Vision is forced to end a life he doesn't want to.   I can't possibly begin to understand the logic that one smile from the audience during all of this is enough ruin an entire act. It just doesn't make any sense."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,the1egend1ives,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:17:12 2015 UTC,"I agree, Ultron's reaction to the Hulk was a genuine response when the Avengers had been attacking him and his clones the whole day. Ultron just wants to get away from the Avengers messing up his plans, plus he needs to put together a backup plan since Vision locked him out of the internet. Him getting frustrated by a flying Hulk is something that we'd feel (before getting Hulk smashed) if we were also in that plane. I also agree that there were a ton of serious moments and themes in this movie and people shouldn't get so angry about the use of humor. Heck, the first Avengers movie (that people claim is better than Age of Ultron) has more humor and the villain regularly jokes around. Yes, the trailers show Ultron as serious and dangerous. But throughout the movie, he was dangerous (quickly destroyed a city and nearly destroyed the world) and serious at times."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,kotb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:43:33 2015 UTC,The part in the church could have been a real intense moment and a really good introduction to ultron until he made a stupid children home.

It's still intense but without becoming preachy."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,the1egend1ives,2,Sun Jul 12 13:19:11 2015 UTC,...should Ultron not be preachy? He's an insane robot obsessed with saving the world by destroying it. Preachiness would be totally in line with that.
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,ksaid1,3,Sun Jul 12 15:55:32 2015 UTC,You can give a character opinions and motivation and not be preachy. Preachiness is pretentious. The best example I can think of is Bane from TDKR.

Lots of that can be attributed to Joss and I really wonder if that was a subliminal ""F U"" to the Marvel movie experience.  The first Avengers had funny moments and quips....but well timed quips.  There's a difference: there's letting some steam out of a movie filled with overly self-serious situation that involve green rage monsters or grey aliens from the sky.  And then there's a ""quip per page"" joke after joke script.  It takes ALL the wind out of the sails of the threats, which you have to get into and suspend disbelief to enjoy...otherwise you get the ""ripped from a comics panel"" moments where everyone in the theater (and even on screen) are rolling their eyes.  Look at the SDCC panel from 2011, Joss was so excited to be making that movie and it showed.  And all we heard rolling into this movie was how it nearly killed him, and he was so exhausted, and so on.  It totally reflected in his work and made AOU my biggest disappointment.  Not the worst movie, but from the bar he set in the first one to this?  Dropped the ball.  As for the rest of phase 2, I'll sum it up in short turns.  IM3: Humor is a defense mechanism for Tony.  He's dealing with his PTSD of the attack on New York, and a certain level of humor was expected. Thor TDW: a little over on humor...you already have ""wacky"" Darcy, and then Selvig is all crazy and missing (to the characters) for half the flick.  But again, letting the air out...like when Thor and Jane are stuck in another world and her phone starts ringing.  Good comedic moment. Cap2: Not much on humor, and didn't need it. GOTG: Humor and the light-hearted space odyssey was part of the tone, and it paid off in spades.    I'm with you, I'm glad the Russo's are directing and that Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are writing a bunch from here out.  These movies won't ever go fully Nolan's Batman dark, and that's OK.  We get that in Daredevil, and hopefully the rest of the Netflix series.  It's like the comics themselves, you've got different tones for different characters and they can still all inhabit the same world, and that's exciting.  Now if only we could get more TV/Movie crossovers....."

It was one of many spots which raised Hulk's profile and kept Loki sidelined while the Avengers closed the portal, which was needed so people don't ask why Loki didn't try and interfere.    Ultron however was completely neutered tonally.  He went from comic uber villain, one of the Avengers nastiest, to what looked like a menacing opponent in the trailers, to a jokey mess who loses pretty much every fight.  Baron Strucker? Surrender joke, dead.  So much for the last hurrah of Hydra, also completely marginalized.

Baron Strucker's death is ultimately meaningless considering we have Arnim Zola, Baron Zemo, and the possible return of Red Skull. Hydra's pretty much an exhausted villain at this point. Time for something new."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,the1egend1ives,0,Sun Jul 12 17:04:23 2015 UTC,"Ultron wasn't menacing in the trailers. Picture everything he said coming from Ronan or Malekith. It's a near seamless dub. That's what a cheesy, generic villain sounds like.   OK, not sure what you're trying to prove here....since that only furthers my point of Ultron being a sub par villain, which you (I think) are couner-pointing?   How many times did Loki lose in the Avengers? Twice? Once to Cap and Iron Man and again to the Hulk? I seem to recall Ultron stealing the sceptre and also curb-stomping the Avengers while taking the Vibranium.    Since I guess we're doing this: Loki lost the first time on purpose.  That was given away in multiple context clues, and included his speech about SHIELD's use of the Tesseract so that he could further drive wedges between the team.  Ultron blitz attacked and stole the scepter.  OK, I hear ya on that one, and he got a drone to grab it and run.  Didn't exactly win a fight there.  As for the Vibranium, didn't the prime Ultron fly off in battle with Iron Man, lose and get blown to smithereens?  I mean, credit, it's hard to beat an opponent who can just change bodies on the fly, but he's still ending his battles as crumpled bits of metal on the floor.   Baron Strucker's death is ultimately meaningless considering we have Arnim Zola, Baron Zemo, and the possible return of Red Skull. Hydra's pretty much an exhausted villain at this point. Time for something new.   Again, not quite sure how that helps your point.  Arnim Zola, Hydra (see both Cap movies), Red Skull (Hydra leader, unconfirmed return, although it would be cool), and Baron Zemo (unknown MCU affiliation at this point, hopefully running his own Masters of Evil but he too has been HYDRA affiliated recently in the comics).  I'm not sure how that's ""new""."

Those particular lines in the trailer, worded as they were and with zero context, were basically just generic villain dialogue.   ""How could you possibly stop me?"" ""I'm going to tear you apart from the inside."" ""There's only one path to peace, your extinction.""  Each of those lines, by themselves, sounds ultra corny.

So when Loki loses a fight to achieve his goals, it's good. But when Ultron loses a fight to achieve his goals, it's bad? He got the Sceptre and the Vibranium. That's not losing, that's winning.  Ultron incapacitated the entire Avengers team in South Africa. Yes, he had SW and QS helping him out, but where would Loki be without his brainwashed soldiers and Chitauri army?  Speaking of which, when it came down to the final battle, Ultron wins hands down. Ultron lost his MacGuffin in South Korea and still managed to carry out his grand masterstroke on and epic scale. Loki's plan was finished the moment he lost the Tesseract. Ultron's strategy would have wiped out the Earth. Loki's strategy, at the most, would have destroyed Hell's Kitchen. Ultron was able to hold his own against Cap and Widow, and against Thor in his vibranium shell. It took Vision, Thor, Iron Man and a Hulk to finally defeat him. Loki lost tragically to just one of the Avengers.   Again, not quite sure how that helps your point. Arnim Zola, Hydra (see both Cap movies), Red Skull (Hydra leader, unconfirmed return, although it would be cool), and Baron Zemo (unknown MCU affiliation at this point, hopefully running his own Masters of Evil but he too has been HYDRA affiliated recently in the comics).

It's still cheesy villain dialogue, and I fail to see how that makes it ""so much more"".  Ultron still becomes sentient and decides humanity needs to be wiped out, pretty much a standard sci-fi genre approach.  And I wanted him to be like that....a blood-thirsty genocidal robot, much like his comic self.  But he plays so many more lines than that in a jokey manner.  OK, he's Stark's ""child"" and that plays into the personality...I've made my peace with that.  But he's still a generic villain IMO.  He falls into the formula ""Villains is hell bent on goal"".  That's it, the full measure of his character definition.  He is ""born"", he immediately decides to wipe out humanity, and short of killing you know who (skipping names in lieu of spoilers, for the sake of anyone reading who maybe didn't see it), his confirmed body count is no better than probably what the Chitauri killed.  Loki did get Coulson, even if they brought him back right after.....  So Ultron didn't really land with me as this big bad.  Instead he falls into the ""one and done"" generic villain that the MCU has had issues with in general.   So when Loki loses a fight to achieve his goals, it's good.

Yes, he had SW and QS helping him out, but where would Loki be without his brainwashed soldiers and Chitauri army?   Never said it was bad, only that he wasn't much of a physical threat.  Loki isn't one either, he's more of a manipulator, but he's battled Thor one on one, and always tricks his way into what he wants....so even in his losses, he's gaining ground.  That's what I like about him as a MCU villain.    Ultron accomplished getting away with the scepter on a hit and run, and distracted Tony so that SW could mindf--k Banner.  OK, that worked, but this is a villain that should be able to take on the Avengers single-handedly.  And he never was that much of a threat.  You just seem to have a hair up your ass about differing opinions and want to prove me wrong...but that's not a feasible outcome.  As for the final battle, Loki was in front of an alien invasion.  If he won, he's looking to subjugate and rule whatever was left.  I don't think he was destroying ""Hell's Kitchen"", more like all of New York, and then spreading from there.  If the Avengers fell, no one else would stop him.  Except for the nukes they launched, which is a huge bit of self-destruction, and it's unknown if that would have stopped the Chitauri.  Not sure how many more could have come through that portal immediately or well after.  The portal is open, and if only the scepter could close it, I don't think a nuke would.  These are infinity gems after all.    Ultron had his Sephiroth style comet attack.  OK, I can see him going for ""kill all humans"", that was the plan.  Outside of the fuzzy logic of how that exactly worked, it was a master swoop....even if it was Plan B.  So plan A was taking the Vision body and being unstoppable....at least then he'd have been imposing.   What could Baron Strucker have brought to the table that none of the other Hydra leaders have brought thus far? He was perfect for a one-off intro villain. That's it.   Now you are just ignoring points.  Strucker headed the plan.  Those first ultron drones were seen powering up at the Castle after the first Ultron body destruction at the hands of Thor.  So Strucker arguably must have been working on something with robotics and possibly AI, otherwise why have those Ultron bots?  And not to mention, HE SUCCESSFULLY GAVE POWERS.  Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch came from his watch....so even before they could get into how he managed to give them powers, RIP.  They got a little crossover into AOS, and he was setup in the Cap:TWS post credit scene.  So yeah, he could have been interesting.  Even if you get away from him, you're the one saying we need something fresh, something not Hydra, and then listing other villains in his place that ARE HYDRA.  ¯_(ツ)_/¯"

There are so many more serious moments from Ultron. Just watch the scene at the party and the church again. Also, his moments with the cradle, his moment with Natasha, and the entire battle on Sokovia.    But he's still a generic villain IMO. He falls into the formula ""Villains is hell bent on goal"".    But isn't that what he is in the comics? You defined his comic self as a ""blood-thirsty genocidal robot."" Sounds pretty straightforward to me.   That's it, the full measure of his character definition. He is ""born"", he immediately decides to wipe out humanity   An ideal intro to the character would have had to have taken place in a previous film, just like with Loki. There's just too many characters in this film to allow us to ""know"" Ultron before he goes crazy.  With that said, the opening sequence we got in the mind of Ultron was an excellent introduction to the character. In the few seconds, we get a glimpse of his confusion, rage, and calculating demeanor in a visually stunning way. And I'm perfectly fine with that. It's not like we as an audience are supposed to be surprised that in a film called ""Age of Ultron"", Ultron is the main villain.   and short of killing you know who (skipping names in lieu of spoilers, for the sake of anyone reading who maybe didn't see it), his confirmed body count is no better than probably what the Chitauri killed.   I don't get the obsession with body count. Ronan and Malekith killed shitloads of people and they were no more interesting because of it. It's the intent to kill that matters. With Ultron, we got to see that aggression when he seemingly murders JARVIS in front of us.     Instead he falls into the ""one and done"" generic villain that the MCU has had issues with in general.   I disagree. I think Ultron had a lot of depth. At his core, I think he desperately wanted to see humanity reach its potential. That's why he wanted to populate the world with Visions. That's why he bonded with Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, because they actually wanted to change. That was a big deal for Ultron... change. Dropping the city would have killed a lot of people in the initial impact. Billions would probably survive it but then slowly die out from the lack of resources. According to evolution, struggle breeds greatness, and thus change.   Ultron accomplished getting away with the scepter on a hit and run, and distracted Tony so that SW could mindf--k Banner. OK, that worked, but this is a villain that should be able to take on the Avengers single-handedly. And he never was that much of a threat.    Except Ultron was able to take on Captain America and Black Widow even before his Vibranium upgrade. You're forgetting that in the comics, Ultron has an adamantium shell. In this film, the first two acts are all build-up to him getting that upgrade and becoming unstoppable. In the final act, it took the sustained force of Iron Man, Thor, AND an Infinity Stone to finally suppress him. That you could come to the conclusion that he wasn't powerful is beyond me.   As for the final battle, Loki was in front of an alien invasion. If he won, he's looking to subjugate and rule whatever was left. I don't think he was destroying ""Hell's Kitchen"", more like all of New York, and then spreading from there.    Loki's whole strategy was that he was going to take over the world by force. First off, this whole plan is put forth into motion by Thanos, which completely neuters Loki as a main antagonist. Secondly, the Chitauri weren't powerful in the slightest. If Iron Man can shoot down a bunch of those flying jet skis with no trouble at all, do you really think the United States Air Force would have any difficulty? Ultron's army was weak as well, but Ultron wasn't using them to take the world by force. He was going to use them to turn the key and drop the city. If even one of those drones managed to get through the Avengers, the Earth would be fucked. The stakes were far greater because Ultron had a much more thorough plan.   If the Avengers fell, no one else would stop him. Except for the nukes they launched, which is a huge bit of self-destruction, and it's unknown if that would have stopped the Chitauri.    The nuke was a far greater threat than Loki and his army. However, it's totally unbelievable that the the government would respond to this threat with a nuke (in NYC of all places) before deploying troops.   Ultron had his Sephiroth style comet attack. OK, I can see him going for ""kill all humans"", that was the plan. Outside of the fuzzy logic of how that exactly worked   Are you familiar with comets? A big enough impact would not only send tidal waves flooding every shoreline on the face of the earth, it would also kick up so much dust in the atmosphere that the sun can't get through. And since all life on Earth requires solar - global extinction.   even if it was Plan B. So plan A was taking the Vision body and being unstoppable.... at least then he'd have been imposing.   I'm not sure what you're trying to say here.   Now you are just ignoring points. Strucker headed the plan. Those first ultron drones were seen powering up at the Castle after the first Ultron body destruction at the hands of Thor. So Strucker arguably must have been working on something with robotics and possibly AI, otherwise why have those Ultron bots? And not to mention, HE SUCCESSFULLY GAVE POWERS. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch came from his watch....so even before they could get into how he managed to give them powers, RIP. They got a little crossover into AOS, and he was setup in the Cap:TWS post credit scene.    I'm also not sure what you're saying here. Are you saying that Strucker was done right?    Even if you get away from him, you're the one saying we need something fresh, something not Hydra, and then listing other villains in his place that ARE HYDRA.    I would rather not see Hydra again, but if they decided to keep using them, then there's always these guys. I'm not surprised that they killed him off. Strucker is just too similar to them. Nazi scientist bent on world domination? They all fit into this criteria."

You just really can't stand that for some reason.  I agree that Ultron didn't get enough time to build, and that's part of the point.  It's a movie that's the same length as the last film, three more heroes, a new villain and lots of set pieces to make go boom.  It's overstuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey.  And that's why I never really bought into Ultron, in addition to his jokey tone.

If that's what you got, well...art is always subjective.    I'm not unfamiliar with comets, more of the fuzzy logic of how he made it work.

There's a whole faction of users out there hiding in the shadows because anybody who says anything good about the film becomes part of a witch hunt. I don't see how your camp is the one under persecution.  It's certainly not outside the realm of possibility that the majority of users on this sub have a strong bias towards the first Avengers. After all, it was the first film, and nothing will ever recreate the magic of seeing the entire roster for the first time.   Outside of those people, I don't think the disdain for this film is as popular as this sub likes to believe. I see the same users posting negativity over and over again, while people who actually like the film avoid posting at all because it incites a flame war. The negative opinions are always the ones that always generate the most buzz.   I agree that Ultron didn't get enough time to build, and that's part of the point.

And that's why I never really bought into Ultron, in addition to his jokey tone.    I actually think it's a common misconception that villains need build up to their villainy. There's lots of different formulas for making villains, and the slow betrayal is just one of them. Hans Gruber, the Joker, Sauron... these are all good villains that didn't require any build up. They were evil from the start.   Ultron ""murdering"" Jarvis was about the most despicable moment, but we of this sub knew he was just going to be the Vision anyway.   Not true. I assumed he would assimilate Jarvis into the Vision, which is basically death. (assuming he was even alive in the first place.)  I actually just watched Ex Machina yesterday, and it's revealed that Nathan is constantly reformating Ava, dumping her memories to create a better AI. This process is basically like death for Ava. So even though Jarvis survived, he had to completely dump his memories and personality, so he's basically a new entity.   Your statement on his desired outcome begins with ""I think"". If that's what you got, well...art is always subjective   True, but there's plenty of evidence to support my perspective.   I'm not unfamiliar with comets, more of the fuzzy logic of how he made it work.   The thrusters at bottom of the city probably came from Leviathan specimen HYDRA kept in the lab. The city was held together by the Vibranium ore with a strong magnetic field. Do you need a seminar on Iron Man's repulser technology as well?   His A plan was taking over the systems of the world including launch codes and starting his ""vision"", which we both reference. Would he have built a robot master race? Attempted to bond what was left of humanity with them? Seems like he was ready to just wipe out everything based on his final conversation with Vision.    His monologue at the party talked about how humanity hasn't been given the opportunity to evolve. To evolve, there needs to be a struggle for survival.The plan was always to create a force on earth that would drive humanity's evolution upward, and the Vision body was going to be the next step in evolution. Humanity's remaining survivors would willingly adapt by being uploaded into the Vision. When the Vision was taken by the Avengers, Ultron moved on with the plan that he had already set into motion. The Vision would still be a factor, but he wouldn't have the body during the final act.   Loki had far more personality, he got snubbed by his brother, his father, he got in far over his head and still managed to continue to manipulate situations. Just look at where he is now, on the throne of the place he really wanted. Ultron was single-minded and under-developed.   You're comparing a character who's had the chance to develop over the course of three films, to one who's been in only one. But even if we considered that a valid comparison, the Avengers didn't do anything with Loki. In the first movie, he wanted to gain his father's approval by single-handedly defeating the Frost Giant's in battle. He wasn't driven by power or money, he only wanted to be accepted by his father. That was completely ignored in the Avengers when he wanted to subjugate the Earth. He was much more ""generic "" this time around.   Strucker was underdone because they never got into the details of what he was working on, how he made it work, and never got the chance to get close to winning. For as generic as Hydra could be, that was a moment of having them get close to relevant again. Sick of Hydra? Great, fine.    Since we're talking about secondary villains, I think it's relevant to bring up the Chitauri, who were by far the worst villains in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. Zero development at all for these guys, and for a villain that is so pivotal in the final act. Here's an army that we never see until the climax, and hear very little about. This makes it completely impossible for us to take them seriously as a threat that will ""win Loki the earth."" Not to mention they looked stupid as hell flying around on jet skis.  Back to Baron Strucker, there were plenty of context clues scattered throughout about Strucker's experimentation (in the beginning, we see Strucker and the doctor talk about field testing the twins ""show the Avengera what we've worked on."" We also hear Ultron tell the twins ""I've wondered why you two survived Strucker's experiments."" If you were still unsure, Maria Hill even spells it out for Cap.) As far as Ultron is concerned , not only do we see the drones on the table when Tony walks into the lab, but we get a nice lengthy conversation from about Strucker's breakthrough in AI.   Look, I said why I think Loki was superior and why I thought Ultron wasn't nearly as good or fun a villain, and you did the opposite. How much longer are we going to do this? What do you really think is going to happen here?   If you don't want to keep this going, I don't see why you keep responding. Why do you expect me to stop?"
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,the1egend1ives,18,Tue Jul 14 00:39:03 2015 UTC,"I think it works when it's used where it is supposed to be used. The Iron Man triolgy, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant Man, those movies are supposed to be packed with jokes because that's how the characters are and how the movie was meant to be.   TWS worked great because it was serious movie so they cut off the jokes and helped set the tone of the movie but in AoU everyone was Tony Stark in the sense that everyone was cracking one-liners and shit and the whole idea of a more serious, darker and personal movie got lost"
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,Drezza,31,Tue Jul 14 14:37:43 2015 UTC,"It's not the humor,  it's the lack of drama. Instead of dealing with human consequences, they gloss over and detooth the stakes. It's okay to use humor in harrowing situations if the situations remain harrowing. But changing the situation into a joke is the problem.  For instance, when Iron Man and Ultron trade barbs and then pubch each other for a bit and then the fight ends up not mattering...what was the point? Or when Klaue has his hand cut off and then there's a joke and then we never see Klaue again. What was the point?"
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,BZenMojo,13,Sat Jul 11 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"Well, we are going to see Klaw again, actually. He's a Black Panther villain. Age of Ultron was his introduction."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,Amanoo,18,Sat Jul 11 21:05:26 2015 UTC,"Well, we are going to see Klaw again, actually. He's a Black Panther villain. Age of Ultron was his introduction.    But that's not a movie. This is not how movies are supposed to work. That's how television shows work and they can get away with it because it costs zero dollars to watch an episode of television and you'll have 20+ hours of that thing you're watching thrown at you over the course of a year. We're seriously at the point where we're watching 10-15 minute subplots in movies that won't actually get past the first sequence for another 2 or 3 years.  This is just bad structure. This isn't even a cameo, these are actual characters with relationships who we are told are going to be really important but they go absolutely nowhere within the actual movie they are in.  Marvel is torn between trying to get people interested in side-characters and separate franchises and not really wanting to devote the time to making the characters within those franchises that cross over matter in the plot. Vibranium serves almost no purpose in Age of Ultron except as a mid-movie McGuffin to tack onto a series of other McGuffins which don't actually complicate or elevate the stakes. It doesn't make Ultron more dangerous, it doesn't have any personal connection to any of the characters, it's just a THING to grab so they can namedrop a separate movie.  Now, if Klaue were shown as a total crazy badass that the characters had to play off of, that would be one thing. But he's just some dude. If Vibranium ACTUALLY changed the way the characters had to deal with Ultron and flipped the script (so to speak), then that would be another thing. But Vibranium changes NOTHING about this movie, it just gives us more STUFF. Ultron is ultimately just killed by shooting him with lasers in the face set to extra blasty.  So, at the heart of this problem is that Marvel isn't telling stories anymore. It's advertising other movies. There are bits and bobs of junk just stuck to this film that should not be here and Marvel doesn't put in the effort to make it count by altering the course of the plot to account for it. Because in the end, the plots to these movies are starting to matter less and less, and rather than being the organic outgrowth of the consequences of characters' actions they are just a series of canonical references.  Then again, what do we even expect? Baron Von Strucker is set up in Winter Soldier as ""Holy shit, who is that guy?"" and is resolved in his next appearance as ""Oh, that guy cap punched out with one hit, moving on..."" It's...well, it's just not good."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,BZenMojo,3,Sat Jul 11 21:12:56 2015 UTC,Except at this point Marvel isn't just making one-off movies... these are all shared events going across multiple movies.
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,damage3245,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:29:37 2015 UTC,I think most of these arguments are moot in a shared cinematic universe.
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,FlacidRooster,2,Sun Jul 12 16:19:19 2015 UTC,"I think that the previous movies lack of drama is something Feige has become aware of through critique or intrinsic awareness. The fact that he's handed the keys to the city over to the Russo's- who have made the most serious MCU film- make me believe the tone of upcoming movies past Ant-Man will change. We're getting into phase three here so I at least hope for a change, and I have mostly loved the fun of most movies so far."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,1of7billion,26,Mon Jul 13 23:58:08 2015 UTC,"These arguments often tend to come down to a Marvel vs DC slanging match, as the two movie universes have already been pigeon-holed as 'fun vs serious'. This does the discussion a disservice because it applies not just to comic book movies but writing in general.   People will hold up say Man of Steel as an example of why seriousness in comic book movies is a bad thing. This completely misses the reasons why MoS fell flat compared to say Guardians of the Galaxy or Iron Man. It's not the lack of jokes, it's not that it was 'too serious', it's because it simply wasn't very well-written.   A better comparison to make is The Dark Knight, or even better for an MCU comparison is The Winter Soldier, two films with a dark, serious tone with several moments of more subtle humour thrown in, but the enjoyment of the movie is reliant on the thriller aspects of the story. It's easier to dispense with levity with these characters because they're fundamentally closer to reality than the likes of Superman or Thor and the rest of the Avengers, but part of the effectiveness of these movies is the way they suck you into their world through realism.   Realism can mean many different things and to me it's not necessarily about staying close to real life. It's about events in the movie feeling true, consistent and congruent. There's never a moment in the TDK or TWS that you're released from their trance because of this congruency.   In The Dark World (a title suggesting darkness, a more serious tone both dramatically and visually) climactic battle to save the world from anti-matter oblivion, the ""mye-mye"" (mispronunciation of Mjolnir) quip is just one of a series of lines that are totally out of place and completely and absolutely what a vulnerable scared human would not be saying in the absolute clusterfuck of interlocking dimensions and invading aliens going on around them. The most realistic would be screaming and fleeing but that would remove them from their assigned role in the climax of the film. There is a balance to be found by a better writer, that keeps the audience tuned in to the stakes of the scene rather than removing them.   The reason we can believe Peter Quill would make jokes and try a dance-off while the shit hits the fan around him is because he's basically a bit desensitised to danger and chaos due to his lifestyle. He was raised by mercenaries, what do you expect? All the jokes in the film are a natural and believeable outgrowth of the characters. Tony Stark is the same, he's the smartest man in history, he's going to be a bit detached from events and be quick-witted in inappropriate situations.  Some writers, Joss Whedon included, try so hard to make a film some kind of abstract 'piece' or 'experience' and in that abstraction they follow age old narrative and dialogue devices. Whedon has openly talked about his devotion to literary structure, he's a HUGE fan of Shakespeare and all his stories follow a noticeable pattern of Shakespearean acts/scenes. In this devotion he also loves intelligent word-play and I think he knowingly sacrifices immersion for showing off his use of language, and a lot of it comes off as a little bit arrogant, like he's winking at all the observant literary types in the audience, expecting a knowing nod in return.   I think Whedon does a little too much in his screenplays purely for his own benefit and enjoyment which is understandable given the dedication he has to his work. But compare him to the Russo brothers. You don't notice the director or writer in the movie, because they've taken you into their world so effectively and you forget that it's all a dramatic construct. They perhaps did this a little better than the Nolan brothers in creating TDK, which does exhibit noticeable Nolanisms but that might just be my familiarity with his body of work."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,scrantonic1ty,3,Sun Jul 12 05:19:50 2015 UTC,"You nailed it man.  I know a lot of people love Whedonisms, but I can't help but notice that his humorous moments seem to cheapen emotional impact rather than add characterization to deepen that impact, as you said."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,CarbonCreed,4,Sat Jul 11 19:54:19 2015 UTC,"i was a little scared with how long your comment was but it was really good thanks. About that movies have to have the perspective of someone, be the director, be the narrator, in a good movie both are one and the same, the director gives life to the characters and those reflect the mind and soul of the director, the worst thing that can happen to a movie is the director doesn´t get the material and/or doesn´t have a vision, something that happens all the time with executives that believes they know about cinema or the audience, or, in the MCU what happened with Alan Taylor, with Terminator now we have evidence that he´s much more responsable than Marvel for Thor:TDW"

I will also add that the part of the final battle with Thor meekly getting on the subway to get to where he needed to go was an incredibly stupid way to have a break in the action. It wasn't a stupid one-liner, but it made absolutely no sense for Thor, in the middle of a conflict that would ostensibly have universal consequences, to just casually hop on the train and not instead raise hell trying to get back to the scene of the battle. Completely deflated the tension and ruined the moment."

marvelstudios,3cxiiu,Orig_analUse_rname,32,Sat Jul 11 18:24:56 2015 UTC,"His personality made sense in the movie, he was an evil Tony Stark. But he should have had his comic personality of evil Hank Pym, it would've been menacing and much more of a cold, calculating villain.   But that wasn't what Marvel wanted to make him and for what they wanted him to be they did it very well."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,JuanRiveara,21,Sat Jul 11 17:58:27 2015 UTC,That's not the way they presented him in the trailer.
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,Orig_analUse_rname,13,Sat Jul 11 18:06:02 2015 UTC,I really wanted to see trailer Ultron. Especially after I saw AoU in full.
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,thewritingkid,15,Sat Jul 11 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"Marvel doesn't handle the trailers, another company is given the footage and they decide how to present the movie."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,JuanRiveara,32,Sat Jul 11 20:03:22 2015 UTC,Then Marvel should get a better grasp of how the movies are presented. And I think it's clear that the movie would have been better had Ultron been more menacing.
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,Orig_analUse_rname,11,Sat Jul 11 18:29:26 2015 UTC,"It's marketing that works really well for them. When Avengers released their first trailers.. It was all explosions and Transformers-ish sound effects. That attracts the big blockbuster crowd. Yes, there was a giant battle at the end but most of the movie was character development (Helicarrier scenes).   Similarly with Iron Man 3 and AoU, they don't market it as quippy or comedic.. They market it as an epic blockbuster film that you have to see in theaters. That's why Ultron is shown to be more ominous in trailers.. That's why Kingsley is shown to be a villain instead of Trevor.   If they market it as comedic, some would wait for the DVD because there are other movies that just have to be seen in theaters for the experience."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,alijamzz,2,Sat Jul 11 18:38:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of people see movies for the comedy.  Tons of summer blockbusters have like half of the funny jokes in the trailers.

marvelstudios,3cxiiu,CarbonCreed,2,Sat Jul 11 19:07:47 2015 UTC,"While I completely understand where you're coming from.. you kind of know what you're getting into when you watch a Marvel movie. You know it's not going to be dreary or overly gritty. Marvel doesn't need to sell us on the movie, it needs to continue selling it to the larger broader audiences. Comic con, panels, and interviews are for fans like us.. but trailers are definitely made to appeal to a wide summer blockbuster audience."

I felt like they were kinda suggesting that, but the movie is so vague about ultron's creation that that excuse doesn't really work for me. I have a feeling that there are deleted scenes that state it outright."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,fawfulator2,4,Sun Jul 12 13:20:45 2015 UTC,"I agree. I enjoyed Ultron, but I would've liked for him to be a little more sinister like the trailers made him out to be. That said, I'm glad he wasn't just 100% dark and evil. Then people just would've complained about how he's yet another one-dimensional Marvel villain who is evil for the sake of being evil. Ultron being a little funny was a good move because it gave him some personality, however I agree it was a bit much.  Marvel seems to have a difficult time balancing intimidation and depth when it comes to their villains. Ultron oozed personality and depth, but wasn't very threatening. Ronan and Malekith were evil and threatening, but that's all they were. Alexander Pierce was probably the closest they got to that happy medium."

It started to get a little out of hand in Guardians, but it was supposed to be a goofy film and I respect that and hold no judgment whatsoever. It got to be too much in AoU (imo). It's like every other line was a joke or a quip or something sarcastic. Granted, I don't think any of the jokes were bad or annoying jokes, but constantly being bombarded with witty one-liners and quirky quips got old fast. The movie almost refused to be taken seriously until the final big battle. I'm okay with Whedon leaving because while his dialogue is good, it's riddled with jokes and it gets overwhelming. I'm ready for a change of pace."

So it is normal for comicbook movies/series to have humor. Is intrinsic to the genre. The fact that the humor is not done right is a writing problem.  I really like how they did Ultron. He is now probably my favorite villain. I like the ""Language"" and ""didn't see that coming"". The humor in Age of Ultron was great. They are a bunch of friends saving the world. Is normal for a huge amount of humor to happen."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,Shadow_Gabriel,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"Comics Tony Stark uses humor as a defense mechanism for the problems he's had in recent years. There was one time that Mr. Fantastic calls him out for making too many jokes when his drones start attacking everyone, and Tony replies that he lost a ton of money and the public's respect -- if he wasn't busy trying to laugh, he'd be crying. The earlier issues of Invincible Iron Man were very serious, considering Tony was always in danger of dying from his pacemaker (arc reactor in the MCU) running out of energy when he used the suit. While I liked the serious tone they used, the more comedic style of the 2000s were probably more interesting to the younger audience."

marvelstudios,3cxiiu,marmiteisdisgusting,2,Sun Jul 12 00:25:30 2015 UTC,My biggest worry for these upcoming marvel movies are the villains. The DCU looks like so far that's its spending a lot of time on its villains and xmen apocalypse does too. I don't what another asshat of a villain for Thor 3. I want a well written and developed villain. Marvel needs to start realizing that and stop making under developed villains.
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,ReZ-115,4,Sun Jul 12 02:26:15 2015 UTC,"Agree with you completely, and I'm glad to see others starting to feel that way. Winter Soldier was a masterpiece as far as superhero movies go. AoU just felt so... forced. Too many damn jokes. Everyone making the same kinds of jokes. I'm sorry, but a billionaire business man, a SHIELD marksman, and a recently-unfrozen WWII hero are not going to have the same exact sense of humor. Whedon can't write these characters for shit."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,TurkCLE,8,Sun Jul 12 04:42:24 2015 UTC,"I agree. Daredevil is literally the best thing to come out of Marvel Studios, and not only was it more serious, the humor in it was pretty human, and that's why it worked, it never went overboard or got annoying like in Age of Ultron, for example.  So I guess the main problem with jokes is in how they're done, how often they're made and how can they kill the tone. There needs to be some balance or you just end up with a comedy.  After a sucessful first phase, at the ending of the second one, it's been noted that Marvel needs some weight in their movies, something serious to really work, if not you just end up with something bland like Ultron.  But that's just me, tho."

marvelstudios,3cxiiu,threebs,2,Sat Jul 11 23:12:32 2015 UTC,"Warning: wall of text. Sorry.  I think there’s a fundamental disconnect with most people on this sub and how the MCU does things, which they’ve noticed from how villains work. This is not a criticism of what people want from the movies or even how Marvel does things, it’s a specific creative choice that Marvel’s made and that not everybody’s fond of.  Basically, for the most part, the villains of the MCU are literally just there to be foils for the heroes. They are there to make the heroes’ flaws stand out and to take advantage of them, because the heroes grappling with their flaws is the movie. The sweet superheroics are just the action expression of that. And to prevent excessive ‘woe-is-me’-ness, the protagonists joke, according to their characterisations. Tony Stark quips most because he’s self-absorbed and irreverent and usually not willing to admit genuine emotion - humour is his shield. (Consider him telling Pepper “you’re all I have” in IM1, and meaning it, but then he makes a face.) Thor starts out as a spoiled brat who thinks everything’s a lark until he gets hard reality slammed into his face, and his whole first movie is about him becoming a better person for it, and learning actual compassion for his subjects. From then on, he’ll jest and he’ll be serious in equal measure. The rest of the Phase 1 team is more wry because they’re either playing their cards close to their chest (Black Widow, Hawkeye) or they’re in an unfamiliar and potentially hostile environment (Steve, Bruce).  The MCU has repeatedly set a status quo, then changed it. Phase 1’s status quo was disparate heroes, and The Avengers changed that by showing that Earth can defend itself against a cosmic attack. Avengers had quipping, but its plot was driven by a lot of genuine human (or Asgardian) drama between people who really shouldn’t be kept in a room together, which is the entire point of the Avengers as a concept. They are, indeed, a time bomb. Phase 2 dealt with the impact of Earth’s greater involvement in cosmic affairs, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier changed that status quo by revealing that the noble SHIELD was actually under the control of the dastardly HYDRA. The Winter Soldier's dry tone worked because its plot had massive ramifications for the entire MCU. In contrast, Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World and Guardians of the Galaxy were lighter in tone because they were ultimately less impactful on the wider universe. I don’t believe that makes them bad - they were just as much character studies as any other MCU movie. The real conflict and development in IM3 is Tony Stark and how, as a distant and slightly obsessive genius, he has to deal with life. In The Dark World it’s Thor and Loki and the nature of kingship, and in Guardians it’s Life Keeps Taking Stuff From You. Killian, Malekith and Ronan are just symbols of that that the heroes can punch in the face. The MCU feels like a big universe because there's different 'levels' of what happens, from the cosmic (GotG) to the near-Earth cosmic (Thor) to the international (Captain America, Agent Carter, Agents of SHIELD) to the highly public personal (Iron Man) and the small-scale personal (Daredevil, Ant Man). Different feels for different levels - Daredevil’s tone wouldn’t work for Iron Man, let alone Guardians of the Galaxy.  Speaking of Guardians, that movie masterfully showed the audience the Infinity Stones and Thanos. I don’t think it’s a mistake that the underlying plot of the whole MCU was revealed in its wackiest movie yet, and even though Quill makes a joke (“There’s a little pee comin’ outta me right now...”), that’s entirely congruent with the fear that the Infinity Stones should inspire. When Carrina blows up the place, the Guardians high-tail it and basically act like what people in our world would if they found nuclear launch codes. The comedy comes from them all being freaked out. Similarly, the infamous dance off is hilarious because Ronan is so utterly threatening and serious for the entire movie. It’s the contrast that makes that work.  Age of Ultron does have too many jokes, but the problem is deeper than that. Avengers was the game changer for the MCU, and that unintentionally trained everyone to believe that Avengers movies would be the ones where the status quo gets turned on its head. But we were wrong, and The Winter Soldier surprised us. But Age of Ultron can’t make massive changes to the world again so soon after TWS, and it fails as a character study because there’s too many damn characters featuring. The only thing that really changes anything is Thor talking about the Infinity Stones and the addition of Vision, who gets so little screentime he doesn’t have the proper impact at all. Thirdly, Ultron is too funny - literally, he says too many jokes to make the movie work. Ronan balanced the Guardians, but Ultron and the Avengers are both quipping near non-stop, so it all falls apart. Age of Ultron can’t be a game-changer and it can’t be a character study, so it ends up being nothing of any consequence at all. It’s the movie equivalent of an airport lounge - just getting everyone to somewhere else, not a place in of itself. All the joking around is just a symptom of this greater problem.  tl;dr: They're supposed to be funny, but that only works if they're balanced."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,SuddenlyFrogs,2,Sat Jul 11 23:19:38 2015 UTC,"Age of Ultron went far too overboard with the jokes and quips and all that. All tension died out. How can I expect to take these situations seriously when even the characters don't take them seriously?  Didn't ruin the movie for me. I still liked it just fine, but it was a problem."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,Commander_Ninja,2,Sat Jul 11 23:54:23 2015 UTC,"I wish that Age of Ultron had been serious and dark, with small bits of humor, much like Winter Soldier, the secret door bit and things like that were cool, but U!from having lines like ""I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but I would be right now."" Are just silly.   The parts of AoU I liked were the lines like ""I could chock you right now and not change a shade."" And the hard hitting moments for the characters, the death of Quicksilver, Visions birth."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,anotherandomer,3,Sun Jul 12 07:56:08 2015 UTC,"I actually really disagree with this. To me, what makes the Marvel films great is that we see a bunch of superheroes who are friends, who like to be around each other. And in groups of friends I've been in, there's not one person who does the jokes. Sure, there may be a general jokester, but they're not a token. People who like each other joke along with each other, and that's what I love about these films."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,DBones90,5,Sun Jul 12 18:07:51 2015 UTC,"Every MCU movie has differing levels of humor. It all depends on who writes the movie adn what their style is.  So no I don't have a problem with the ""USE"" of humor, not overuse, that's your opinion."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,MrBoltagon,3,Sun Jul 12 22:43:13 2015 UTC,Cough cough that's because Joss Whedon wrote AoU and he apparently needs every character to talk exactly the same without differences in tone and also ignores all characterization in other movies up until that point.

marvelstudios,3cxiiu,Maydietoday,2,Sat Jul 11 19:41:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly. With the latter comparison, I was expecting the ""Empire""(HYDRA/Thanos/Loki) to strike back. It would have been crazy if the movie ended with Thor in chains before Loki on the throne, HYDRA acquiring a massive mind control machine using the stone, and Thanos pulling all their strings from a distance, all while Tony gets put under because of the Ultron incident and is forced to create a superhuman regulatory framework."

marvelstudios,3cxiiu,Tanokki,2,Sat Jul 11 22:32:46 2015 UTC,"Someone pointed out on this sub that it only makes sense for there to be a lot of humor in these films, especially The Avengers, because the films depict a group of friends that are experienced enough to handle anything that comes their way (Before Ultron that is) so it makes sense that they'd be cracking jokes through the battles; they don't really have to fear anything.  Plus, me personally, I'd much rather prefer to have a good laugh every once and a while then be constantly bummed out during the film. (Squints at Man of Steel)"
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,TheTartWhisperer,3,Sat Jul 11 22:34:24 2015 UTC,"It's all part of the ""Marvel villains suck so much even the heroes think they're a joke"" thread then."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,BZenMojo,3,Sat Jul 11 19:52:27 2015 UTC,"I take it as a case by case thing. Iron Mans 1 and 3 did it just right. Iron Man 2 didn't but that's because the whole film was kind of a clusterfuck. Neither of the Captain America films were very humorous and it worked out fine. I liked the humor in the Thor movies for the most part, and in the case of TDW the humor was one of its redeeming elements. Guardians of the Galaxy wasn't funny to me at all but I think it's a matter of the style of humor, not that it was overdoing it. Avengers 1 was alright but had a few joke stinkers, and AOU definitely got annoying. But so far only those two films actually annoyed me with their humor, which makes me think it's a fault specifically of Whedon rather than the MCU."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,AlleyOopToym,2,Sat Jul 11 20:28:25 2015 UTC,"I actually think IM2 had among the best humor and one liners in the MCU, because it was less kiddies jokes and more like adult oriented. That's my biggest beef with the recent MCU films actually, they all have become typical Disney 'we make movies for kids' property. It started with IM3 where Tony spend half of the movie with a kid instead of Pepper Potts. The jokes (and writing in general) for AoU was cringeworthy, IMHO."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,p-longstocking,2,Sat Jul 11 21:10:00 2015 UTC,"I think that the humor in Marvel movies is meant to make the characters more realistic and relatable. Maybe you guys are different, but most of the people I know do what they can to add some wit to normal life, and to see the god of thunder have that same sense of wit makes him seem more real to me. This makes for both a more fun theater experience, and characters that you can leave the theaters wishing you could hang out with. Where I do agree with you, however, is when the story is altered to fit in a joke, and not the other way around. That, at many points, brings me out of the movie (I'm reminded somewhat of the humor in Iron Man 3). This would be more excusable for some of their properties, like GotG and Ant-Man, but that's because those stories fall closer to comedies than action."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,Jeppo3,6,Sat Jul 11 20:29:43 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between wit and goofiness though! Wit usually involves clever writing, goofiness is more like what you get in a romcom or a Johnny Depp movie."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,p-longstocking,0,Sat Jul 11 20:51:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, but if you look at it, most of the MCU humor is wit. Some of it isn't, and that's usually the kind I don't like. When they do things like turn the Mandarin into a punchline, that's goofiness. Most of MCU humor isn't goofiness, it's wit."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,Jeppo3,6,Sat Jul 11 19:16:35 2015 UTC,"There was very little wit in AoU, some of the jokes were so lazy and dumb that it was almost embarrassing. Same with IM3, (allthough the Mandarin twist was actually very funny) which I thought was shocking since Shane Black was a co-writer and he wrote Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, one of the funniest and most clever comedies ever. In GotG it worked because the goofy jokes came across pretty fresh."

When Ultron threw Cap into the train and Hawkeye told Cap to keep him busy, Cap replied with ""what do you think I am doing"" You see that as a joke and a quip while I see that as something a normal person would say in that situation. Also these are blockbusters so there are bound to be one-liners."

marvelstudios,3cxiiu,youmonsterikill,0,Sat Jul 11 18:46:48 2015 UTC,I don't think it's overused. It keeps the characters feeling like people. Batman Forever/& Robin was an overuse of humor.
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,robertluke,0,Sun Jul 12 00:58:35 2015 UTC,"Marvel in the end, is for everyone. Like Disney, they target everyone. Humor is critical in having that ""feel good"" feeling watching the film.  I dont think its overused... however Whedon, he tends to like witty dialogues. The Russos for example dont overuse humor.  I think Marvel is following the right direction, as opposed to the ""so serious"" theme for DC films. Yes, I saw the BvS trailer... looks awesome. But as most DC films, I watch them once and thats it.  Marvel, I usually watch their films when I need to boost my mood."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,1UPZ_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:19:10 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. I only watched the DC movies to try to understand why people claim they're the best comic book movies. I genuinely enjoyed Batman Begins (Liam Neeson is amazing as a villain), but I did not enjoy The Dark Knight. I watched The Dark Knight half a dozen times, but those were my attempts to understand the commotion. The Dark Knight Rises and Man of Steel made a lot of money at the box office, but I can't find anything enjoyable about those movies. Yes, I enjoyed the Superman movies with Christopher Reeves, and Batman The Animated Series is one of my favorite cartoons. But watching the recent DC movies feels more like a philosophy lesson than a movie. I don't think the DC movies are bad, I respect the actors and directors for making comic book characters come to life on the silver screen. It's just frustrating when I see Batman brought down to low point and my friends keep telling me that I'll learn the meaning of life in the movie. I'll save my opinion on Man of Steel for another time, because making another two-hour rant on Superman doesn't work in my schedule at the moment. The majority of the Marvel movies have a lot for me to enjoy. Action, witty dialogue, cool special effects (my favorite part of the Iron Man movies), and interesting stories. While I don't like the Thor movies, I find the stories and Easter eggs interesting for the other movies. I'm looking forward to Thor 3: Ragnarok because that story (from what I saw in the comics) looks really interesting. Iron Man 3 is still my favorite in the MCU due to the story, character development of Tony Stark, and the special effects. While Tony and Rhodey have a lot of jokes between them, they go through a number of serious themes that occasionally need a breather. Age of Ultron is one of my favorite MCU movies, and I find the humor the same as the first Avengers movie. The themes were more serious than the first, and I found Ultron a lot more dangerous than Loki.  I like a little humor in my movies, since I can sometimes connect with the characters. People go through crazy things every day, and there will always be times people will joke around."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,kotb,0,Sun Jul 12 17:37:32 2015 UTC,"I think MCU use humor since all the movies are supposed to attract the whole family viewers. The humor level and subtlety depends on mostly on the Director I guess. For me, the best was the ""Captain America : First Avenger"" followed by Winter Soldier and Avengers.

Other than that I had no problem with any Marvel movie... maybe with an exception of the end of GotG. I think they made Ronan look stupid and weak for sake of Star-Lord's joke. It was embarrassing.
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,el_commediante,2,Sun Jul 12 09:35:51 2015 UTC,"I can see your point there, on the other hand Ronan's reaction to Star-Lord's joke seemed just about perfectly in character as far as he was established in the movie with thinking very highly of himself and taking himself very, very seriously. How else would a zealot on a crusade respond to just... lunacy?"
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,hrafnblod,-1,Sun Jul 12 17:15:23 2015 UTC,"The thing though is, Marvel is a much lighter commodity than DC.  So humor is sort of key in their properties.  Iron-Man is sarcastic, Spider-Man and Deadpool yammer, Scott Lang is a goofball.  I agree that more could be done with the Thor films, but I've always thought so.  That just leaves Cap and Hulk.  In Hulk's case, the humor is subtle and in Cap's case, the movies are usually a bit more serious or could be deemed just as subtle.    When the DCCU comes out, bowls of seriousness all around XDD"

You state that ""all the Phase 2 movies have had an over abundance of it"" yet you state that TWS and GotG did a good job on the humor. That really only leaves IM3, TDW, AoU, and Ant-Man. I haven't seen Ant-Man yet, so I can't comment on that. But TDW wasn't a humorous affair, IM3 was the same as any other movie. The example I can agree on is AoU.  AoU's problem was a Whedon problem. That's what you get when you hire Whedon to direct and write a film. I never really liked his selection as director because I'm not a fan of his work. I didn't watch Angel and Buffy, Firefly, or some of his other works. I've seen  enough of those shows to know I'm not gonna watch them.   Once Whedon is gone, his influence and style is going to go. I think Whedon's take is good enough for a single film franchise like Captain Marvel, but he had too much influence overall."

You can see at every step the movie didn't want any of the villains to be competent or threatening."

AoS was described by fans of his show as being a great example of what he does, especially at the beginning. And I've seen that."
marvelstudios,3cxiiu,matty_nice,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:06:34 2015 UTC,"Not to slam AoS, but it is (especially at the beginning) more like a poor attempt to copy Whedon's style. By the end of season two it figured out how to do more of it's own thing.  AoS doesn't hold a candle to Firefly, which was special. And Buffy varies a lot, and isn't for everybody, but is like nothing else that has ever been on TV. Dollhouse is crazy and different than anything else Whedon has done.  I don't know what happened on Age of Ultron. It's like he lost something important along the way."

marvelstudios,3cyq6m,009reloaded,2,Sun Jul 12 00:42:03 2015 UTC,"From what I recall, there was a pretty big uproar of AoS fans who had yet to see CA:WS and felt like they had it spoiled for them. So even people sticking out the (summarily regarded as) rough first season, and so presumably fairly into the MCU still didn't, as a whole, see it coming."
marvelstudios,3cyq6m,Islero47,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:00:47 2015 UTC,That would suck.   I don't know how you would watch Shield and not expect it to have a tie in though... or to have that show not be completely altered by the movie.
marvelstudios,3cyq6m,Friendly_B,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:10:58 2015 UTC,"To be fair the only tie-ins before that were minor references to iron man 3, the avengers, and an episode that built on but didnt really spoil much of thor 2. CA TWS basically was a game changer for the show."
marvelstudios,3cyq6m,Makelikeawillis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:03:42 2015 UTC,"I agree.    Don't forget though, that the show was still building into being tied in to the movies.  It had far less information to go on, earlier.    Were YOU upset by the television show Shield being affected by the movie Shield falling apart?  Would you have preferred that the movie Shield be held sacrosanct to preserve the status quo of the television Shield, or perhaps that the television Shield not be affected by the dissolution of the movie Shield?"
marvelstudios,3cyq6m,Friendly_B,2,Tue Jul 14 04:40:41 2015 UTC,"This was my TWS experience Before the movie: ""Cool trailers, I guess I'm following this universe now so let's watch it. Cap 1 was really meh, but not bad..."" During the movie: ""Huh. Cool. Wow. WOW. WOOOW. WHAAAAT."" After the movie: ""My body wasn't expecting these levels of surprise, that was absolutely fantastic."" Since then I've been obsessed with the MCU. I know I know, it's recent, and I'm not a comicbook nerd, but I can't help it. It's -mostly- fucking awesome."

marvelstudios,3cyq6m,Sinister-D-,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:14:23 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of fans knew Hydra would be in the film in some capacity, obviously going to return at some stage, I think it's primarily the fact that they were essentially inside SHIELD that was the biggest surprise. As for the general public though, there was never any hint they'd be in the film, so probably a complete surprise for them."
marvelstudios,3cyq6m,charlie2094,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:07:06 2015 UTC,"I'd seen a few threads on here that spoiled the winter soldiers identity, but no, I had no idea that HYDRA was coming"
marvelstudios,3cyq6m,kerbal314,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:37:01 2015 UTC,"Well, once they'd announced the title was going to be ""CA: TWS"", those of us who knew the comics knew it was going to be about Bucky."
marvelstudios,3cyq6m,sacredblasphemies,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:49:07 2015 UTC,"Here in Chennai, India, there was a small ad by a local cinema giving the showtime for CA2. In that HYDRA's logo was placed behind Cap, and that further aroused my suspicions. I knew that Pierce was going to be the villain. I knew that Zola was also appearing, although it could have been flashbacks. In the episode of Agents of SHIELD with Thomas Nash, the audio recording that played as he threatened SHIELD mentioned a far stronger force in a very ominous tone, and I knew that AoS was gonna change heavily after CA2 because of an interview I read. I'd also seen that Strucker was casted for AoU and I'd also seen very briefly that he was set to appear in the post-credits scene.  So all in all, yeah, my suspicions were pretty damn high."
marvelstudios,3cyq6m,Midhav,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:49:03 2015 UTC,"I got spoiled by AoS before I could go see it, sadly. Now, the identity of the Winter Soldier? I was one of like 4 people that surprised, lol."

(I was waiting to catch up on the rest of the season until I could watch TWS.) So I had both the Hydra twist and the fact that Ward was Hydra spoiled for me in advance by that one post >.>"
marvelstudios,3cyq6m,V2Blast,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:45:51 2015 UTC,I didn't see the movie until months after it came out so I was spoiled but before that I had completely no idea.
marvelstudios,3cyq6m,JuanRiveara,7,Tue Jul 14 18:04:09 2015 UTC,So what you're saying is you didn't know about it until you knew about it?
marvelstudios,3cyq6m,Keepitstrong05,2,Sun Jul 12 00:42:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I was really disappointed finding out by a bunch of people saying Hail Hydra. I would have really loved to be caught off guard watching it."
marvelstudios,3cyq6m,JuanRiveara,0,Sun Jul 12 01:45:37 2015 UTC,Then you should've seen it before it had been out for months.
marvelstudios,3cyq6m,Runninlovr14,2,Sun Jul 12 01:48:01 2015 UTC,"I know, money and time was really tight then. When those things were available it was out of theaters."

marvelstudios,3cyq6m,masturnation47,0,Sun Jul 12 03:51:49 2015 UTC,"It happened in the comics, so it wasn't a super-big shock."

marvelstudios,3d2dsa,doestthouevenhoist,15,Sun Jul 12 23:42:53 2015 UTC,"They're doing the ""street-level"" heroes, so there's more than decent chance. Agent Carter is apparently laying some possible groundwork for Cloak (and Dagger) this season, too, so fingers crossed!"

marvelstudios,3d2dsa,meme-com-poop,5,Mon Jul 13 18:54:42 2015 UTC,Why would thunderbolts be street based?
marvelstudios,3d2dsa,RobertGonzales,4,Mon Jul 13 06:04:42 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the conversation, dude. This sub has been buzzing about the prospect of a Moon Knight series since Daredevil was announced :p"
marvelstudios,3d2dsa,ksaid1,3,Mon Jul 13 04:52:14 2015 UTC,I feel the need to link to this movie outline whenever someone mentions Moon Knight.  Could probably be adapted into a show easily enough.
marvelstudios,3d2dsa,maxyyb99,4,Mon Jul 13 11:36:41 2015 UTC,As long as Runaways on Netflix happens relatively soon I'll be happy.
marvelstudios,3d2dsa,JuanRiveara,2,Sun Jul 12 23:50:54 2015 UTC,"I don't quite understand the Netflix revenue model. Is there a limit on their end to how many shows they'll pick up? Or is there concern from Marvel about the nebulous 'over-saturation' problem?   Daredevil performed phenomenally well. It's also one of Marvel's biggest critical successes at this stage. If they can repeat the formula I think this is actually going to revolutionize the industry.   Everyone is focusing on the big blockbusters, because they're amazing spectacles. The build tremendous amounts of hype and bring in a lot of revenue. But comics are serial by nature. All of the tremendous source material that's fueling this train exists in episodic format that they have to mine for value, keeping what pops and discarding what doesn't.  With Netflix they have a have a long format, uncensored, instantly accessible, playground to build and test a variety of characters and stories from the comics. Things that would have never worked on film or required too much time and effort to build up to. Civil War never should have been a film. In an ideal world it would have existed after several seasons of multiple shows when the impact would have felt like it did in the comics. That ship has sailed, but there are hundreds of other great crossover events that we might actually get to see if this takes off.  I might be alone, but even with all these great movies coming out of Marvel, DC and Fox, the thing I'm most looking forward to is Jessica Jones, Daredevil Season 2, Luke Cage and Iron Fist. The shear amount of content, real character development and surprises completely blows any of the films out of the water. They just can't compete with 10 -13 hours of well crafted story-telling it would take them years to try.  I hope these shows do well, and I hope we see more shows on the horizon."
marvelstudios,3d2dsa,youmonsterikill,2,Mon Jul 13 00:59:56 2015 UTC,Yes the Netflix stuff is good but I doubt they bring in the sort of revenue the movies do. AOU had close to $1.5B in ticket sales remember.  Also the movies are more family freindly and they can sell more merchandise.  I'm sceptical the Punisher is the sort of character you want to promote to children.
marvelstudios,3d2dsa,ralphuniverse,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:48:28 2015 UTC,"True, about the revenue.  I really don't understand how Netflix works.. On the merchandise issue, 5 years ago I would have agreed,  but walking through the Target toy Isle last night with my 4 year old I was astounded by most picked over Toys. Right there next to minecraft and terraria walking dead dismembered zombies sold out.  Call of duty black ops soldiers sold out. Assassin's creed, only one toy left,  Machiavelli. We are in a strange age where things made for adults are marketed to children across the board. They have Winter Soldier toys, like a lot. I can't imagine kids watching much less enjoying that film."
marvelstudios,3d2dsa,youmonsterikill,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:44:40 2015 UTC,"You can't imagine kids enjoying The Winter Soldier, really? When were you kid did you not watch Batman (1989) or the Alien movies, Jaws, Predator or Terminator? Kids have never exclusively just watched kids movies."
marvelstudios,3d2dsa,suss2it,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:29:56 2015 UTC,"Lol, I wasn't allowed to watch Simpsons, but I guess my experiences are hardly conventional."
marvelstudios,3d2dsa,youmonsterikill,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:32:54 2015 UTC,"Netflix has 50+ million subscribers that each pay $9 bucks a month. That's $450 million a month, so I'd say they've got deep enough pockets to fund a lot of original content. Their Game of Thrones rip-off, Marco Polo's first season had a budget of $90 million for example."
marvelstudios,3cy0n1,rhodetolove,83,Sat Jul 11 20:16:37 2015 UTC,"I doubt that Black Widow attended the SHIELD Academy like most of the AoS characters did, where they presumably teach things like the history of SHIELD and its founders. Widow was recruited by Hawkeye after spending her life as a rogue agent. The process of becoming a member of SHIELD for her was probably different, and she never had to learn too much about SHIELD's history."
marvelstudios,3cy0n1,ItsStevoHooray,21,Sat Jul 11 20:35:30 2015 UTC,"Widow was already an adult and a full on assassin before she ""defected"" to S.H.I.E.L.D. I'm sure there was some protocol stuff that they had to cover with her, but the rest wasn't necessary because she was so experienced already (that's what I get from the films as well as the general knowledge I have of the character)."
marvelstudios,3cy0n1,UmbrusNightshade,7,Sun Jul 12 03:17:37 2015 UTC,Similar to Skye
marvelstudios,3cy0n1,BiggChicken,45,Sun Jul 12 14:59:20 2015 UTC,"Black Widow's ""power"" is to get people to talk.  She does this through a variety of tactics to lower people's guard and say more than they planned.  Admitting she knew who Peggie was would not have gotten Cap to open up about his past and his relationships, which is what she was all about all movie."
marvelstudios,3cy0n1,mastyrwerk,15,Sat Jul 11 21:10:17 2015 UTC,Exactly.  She's a master manipulator.  She always knows more than she lets on.  To anyone.  Ever.
marvelstudios,3cy0n1,autojourno,6,Sun Jul 12 04:40:51 2015 UTC,"Nah, she didn't attend shield Academy she only defected a few years ago, she missed history class, even if she knew the name, doesn't mean she would recognize her in a picture"

marvelstudios,3cy0n1,your_mind_aches,6,Sun Jul 12 05:56:16 2015 UTC,"I was talking about Peggy being interviewed.  She was famous for being a Howling Commando, starting SHIELD, and dating Captain America.  It was pretty common knowledge."

marvelstudios,3cy0n1,CarbonCreed,21,Sun Jul 12 06:45:00 2015 UTC,"See, I always kind of read that scene as Natasha does know, she's just needling Steve in a weird is-she-why-you're-still-single kind of way.

marvelstudios,3cy0n1,JuanRiveara,3,Sat Jul 11 21:06:59 2015 UTC,"That would make the line very mean-spirited, which I don't think was the intent."
marvelstudios,3cy0n1,SuperCoenBros,15,Sat Jul 11 21:31:21 2015 UTC,She probably didn't care to learn.
marvelstudios,3cy0n1,kerbal314,12,Sat Jul 11 20:22:58 2015 UTC,Jemma is a SHIELD nerd. Natasha is a field agent and Fury loyalist with more important things to worry about.

marvelstudios,3cy0n1,jmoney777,3,Sun Jul 12 01:05:24 2015 UTC,I was always under the impression Natasha knew who it was but kinda wanted Steve to discuss her.  Her surprised look maybe came more from his reaction. Steve seemed outwardly bitter/sad and then left. She probably wasn't expecting that reaction.
marvelstudios,3cy0n1,your_mind_aches,3,Sun Jul 12 05:51:35 2015 UTC,"I have no doubt that she didn't know who Peggy Carter was, she just wanted to see Steve's reaction"
marvelstudios,3cy0n1,Tebeku,2,Sat Jul 11 21:18:16 2015 UTC,"Despite these no-prize explanations, I'd say this falls into the same category of problems like Banner not knowing about Vibranium in Age of Ultron despite having used it to build his own safe house in Incredible Hulk according to Agents of SHIELD."
marvelstudios,3cy0n1,Mike5482,2,Sun Jul 12 18:16:10 2015 UTC,The TV writers assumed that Peggy was well-known within SHIELD  (Ok maybe that's a poor argument because Peggy was a founder)
marvelstudios,3d0qdj,DeathFeind,7,Sun Jul 12 15:24:42 2015 UTC,They probably don't have much to show for their films and Netflix shows. I expect them to show a bunch of stuff off at Disney's D23 and New York Comic Con.
marvelstudios,3d0qdj,JuanRiveara,3,Sun Jul 12 15:37:43 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for Daredevil, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage for NYCC"
marvelstudios,3d0qdj,doestthouevenhoist,2,Sun Jul 12 18:25:12 2015 UTC,"Apperabtly the Agent Carter and AoS panels were fun though.  I mean of course movies get more hype, a lot of the DC TV people were there and you didn't hear much from them either. It's best Marvel didn't go if they had nothing to say than get beat by DC with BvS + Suicide Squad or even Fox with F4+Deadpool+Wolverine+X-Men+Gambit"
marvelstudios,3d0qdj,rhodetolove,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:13:37 2015 UTC,"I was talking about the panel for Arrow, Flash, Gotham and the new Legends of Tomorrow.

Id appreciate atleast a hint of who will be a secret warrior since its obv not going to be like the comics since everything now is retcon."
marvelstudios,3d0qdj,j4_jjjj,2,Sun Jul 12 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"theyre pretty much moving all the big stuff to D23. i dont know if this is permanent, but i assume if D23 grows in popularity because of it that they will probably continue trimming their comic con appearances. D23 is a competing con, they want to raise attendance, this seems like a good way to bolster attendance and revenue for the con."

marvelstudios,3cv7i9,soulbreaker1418,45,Sat Jul 11 20:52:16 2015 UTC,Emily VanCamp  They've been calling each other niece and aunt on Twitter lately.
marvelstudios,3cv7i9,wierdaaron,10,Sat Jul 11 02:17:39 2015 UTC,we kind of give it for certain she was her granddaughter but a 2nd generation niece is possible too
marvelstudios,3cv7i9,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,20,Sat Jul 11 02:18:57 2015 UTC,"Well originally Sharon was Peggy's little sister. Then they retconned her to niece. At this point though, you're right. The age different is so much that granddaughter is probably more realistic."
marvelstudios,3cv7i9,Rocketman_man,21,Sat Jul 11 02:37:01 2015 UTC,"This is the flaw in the otherwise beautiful contrivance that is Captain America, because the frozen-in-ice mechanic allows it to be modern in any era without having to change the backstory.  Consider Tony Stark, whose backstory always has to be updated to explain what war or conflict he was involved with when he was first captured. Originally it was Vietnam, today it's middle eastern terrorists, in the future it will be some other thing. But Cap can always be a WW2 guy who was frozen back then, and wakes up now. They never have to modernize his origin other than how many years he's been frozen. In the year 2525, if man is still alive, they can still tell Captain America stories as a guy frozen since WW2 who just woke up a little bit ago.  But having characters who knew him before he was frozen complicates it. As it becomes less likely for someone around in the 40s to still be alive, they can't have characters like Peggy who knew Steve before and after the ice."
marvelstudios,3cv7i9,TheJonatron,15,Sat Jul 11 02:44:09 2015 UTC,"The whole ""man out of time"" aspect of his character only gets better though. When they brought him back in the 60s he'd been in the ice for less than 30 years, sure things had changed but compare that to now."

marvelstudios,3cvpf3,JuanRiveara,33,Sat Jul 11 05:12:28 2015 UTC,"Alright, alright, alright, but Cranston would have fun with it as he's a comedian, goblin can't be too serious. He needs to LOOK like the god damn goblin for once. Similar to this compositeeffects.com/mystore/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=2390 He needs to be able to be charming and warm and flip the switch to controlling manipulative asshole on a dime to straight up laughing psycho. Picture cranston a scenes with Aaron Paul when he's acting like an upset dad in Breaking Bad. He could do that with Harry and it be perfection. They need to cast him and keep him around as a recurring character in the MCU."
marvelstudios,3cvpf3,monkiddo,15,Sat Jul 11 05:21:36 2015 UTC,"I think you're underestimating McConaughey's acting range. If you've seen Wolf of Wallstreet than you know he was hilarious in really his only scene in the film, I'm sure there are better examples of his comedic chops but that's the first thing that comes to my mind. I also think he could play a great father figure with good advice. I mean the man is one of the best actors of this generation and if he played anyone that performance would be great, Norman Osborn would just be the best use of all of his talents IMO."
marvelstudios,3cvpf3,JuanRiveara,4,Sat Jul 11 05:42:57 2015 UTC,He was pretty damn funny in Tropic Thunder.

marvelstudios,3cwsl8,SirHoneyDip,5,Sun Jul 12 18:31:27 2015 UTC,"I would think we can look to the Ultimate universe as a reference point for how they can shoe horn it in.  We are fixated on the MCU being grounded in realism but really in Thor all that was done was Odinson hand waving saying there is no difference (between science and ""magic"")  I think just explaining it briefly as tampering with ""the source code"" of the universe or interdimensionality influencing our petty realms, a throw away line when Strange is incredulous and we are on the ride.  Edit: in case someone doesn't agree with me, I concede that we as fans want to know the inner workings on the MCU, the sources of these powers and their hierarchy, we are the nerds and these movies are made for mass markets. The general consumer just needs a little context and not everything spelled out for them. Besides production will be preoccupied getting supernatural horror into the mix properly, it's the biggest hurdle for marvel since getting Asgard into the MCU. Which historically was an issue."

And it worked.  As for MCU, yeah I'm wondering too.

marvelstudios,3cuyjm,Mercpool87,5,Sat Jul 11 00:47:18 2015 UTC,This isn't about Punisher but Ryan Reynolds was brilliant in that scene.
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,JuanRiveara,3,Sat Jul 11 00:56:36 2015 UTC,What movie is it?
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,PCR12,3,Sat Jul 11 02:18:24 2015 UTC,Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle.
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,SwagBelow,7,Sat Jul 11 02:34:26 2015 UTC,"No, it really isn't. When he's doing recon or trying to just blend in with the city folk he doesn't wear the skull."
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,BLUNTforDANVERS,-11,Sat Jul 11 04:28:30 2015 UTC,But he does not blend that is not his MO. Punisher does not need to blend in or go undercover because he studies his targets when even wearing  the cosutme. Many Punisher arcs have him where the costume at all times even in casual situations.They could have just put the Skull because that is how criminals know him by.
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,SwagBelow,7,Sat Jul 11 04:37:21 2015 UTC,That wouldn't really fly in this series though.
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,BLUNTforDANVERS,-10,Sat Jul 11 05:12:40 2015 UTC,Why not? Its just a shirt i don't understand why people are defending this and  iam getting downvoted. Its a skull on a shirt and would have taken no effort to do.
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,SwagBelow,7,Sat Jul 11 05:19:40 2015 UTC,Well the Daredevil series is steeped in realism to some degree. The guy who brutally murders criminals wearing his costume he does it in while he's out kind of flies in the face of that.
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,BLUNTforDANVERS,-13,Sat Jul 11 05:23:19 2015 UTC,No it does not fly in the face of that.People have seen his face because he does not where a mask or have a secret identity. It still does not affect him. The Skull would been no big deal and Punisher just has a shirt with a skull design and the series would still be realistic.
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,soulbreaker1418,8,Sat Jul 11 05:30:47 2015 UTC,"It kind of does though. Seeing his face is one thing, but if he's also walking around in his costume, that would definitely look weird in the context of his show.   Hell, he's even covered his face sometimes in some newer graphic novels I flipped through."
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,SwagBelow,11,Sat Jul 11 05:38:54 2015 UTC,"that´s a little silly, he uses the skull like Batman uses the bat to streak fear in others not just to look cool"
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,longooglite,-21,Sat Jul 11 00:58:54 2015 UTC,But it is not silly though. Punisher is not like batman. the Batsuit is just a costume that Bruce Wayne wheres but the Punisher Skull that Frank wears is a part of him. He has worn it while in diners and eating lunch. Frank Castle died along with his family and all that is left is the Punisher. There is no secret identity there is only the mission. I am exicted for the season but they should have left the Skull on the shirt and it would have been no big deal. It is just a shirt.
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,SwagBelow,8,Sat Jul 11 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"Okay, Batman is not a costume Bruce Wayne wears. It's, if anything, the opposite"
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,Shermer_Punt,-15,Sat Jul 11 03:03:24 2015 UTC,Ok i get what you are saying but Frank Castle does not have a secret identity. He should have the costume on at all times.
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,SwagBelow,7,Sat Jul 11 03:34:07 2015 UTC,Now your just trolling.
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,soulbreaker1418,-11,Sat Jul 11 05:07:04 2015 UTC,I am being serious. I don't understand why more people are annoyed or irradiated. Punisher does not have a secret identity and putting a white Skull would have taken no effort.The Punisher does not blend in or go undercover.He just kills bad guys and they should have put the Skull on the shirt.
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,SwagBelow,8,Sat Jul 11 05:15:54 2015 UTC,"of course not, if you are a police a knows he wears a skull t-shirt you get him inmediately, bad people would run away if he wants to gather info etc, remember in the MCU that skull is unique  to him, nobody else wears it"
marvelstudios,3cuyjm,soulbreaker1418,-12,Sat Jul 11 01:15:08 2015 UTC,I get that but in the Comics the Skull is unique to him and he still does all the things you said he does with it on. I like the fact that when criminals see it they start to shit themselves and know they are going to die. It makes it cool. I just hope we see it a lot.

Darkforce, imo, is what powers the Obilisk in AoS. They will probably reference it in Agent Carter and bring it back in AoS as build up for Dr. Strange coming out late next year.  They are trying to keep the ABC series about the non powered people with some exceptions.

marvelstudios,3ctone,suss2it,3,Sat Jul 11 11:55:19 2015 UTC,"For me, Ultimate Cap comes off bad because of a mixture the team as a whole, as well as the writing, my own experiences, and when compared to 616 Cap. (been a while since I read anything Ultimate so feel free to correct me if Im wrong on some of the stuff below)  I think all of the ultimates are flawed / unstable / potential dick versions of their 616 counterparts. I mean, Hank actually tried to murder Janet in a jealous rage with ants (basically taking the ""wife beater"" incident of the character and amplifying it ten fold). And Banner actually also deliberately Hulks out so he can be useful because he feels worthless and not respected on the team.  In reaction to both of these incidents, Rogers uses violence. Captain America searches for Pym and beats him up, and also assaults Banner after he has turned back to normal. Arguably, Cap isn't a dick because of his actions during this run (if I found out a female friend of mine was hospitalised, I probably would want to teach the guy who did it a lesson as well)- he just is more prone to letting his anger, mixed with old fashioned values, get the better of him. He is definitely more prone to violence than the 616 Steve Rogers.  If I'm honest, the way he was written in Ultimates didn't gain much sympathy for him being ""the man out of time"". Every scene with him and Janet was him complaining about the world and how values have changed. This may be accurate, and i understand how frustration sudden change can be, but too much of it doesn't garner sympathy for me as a reader.   For me, he isn't really a dick. The writing just didn't make me like him as a character or relate to him as much as I do 616. I lost a few years of my memory a while ago, and seeing how much can change within the years that you ""missed"" can be shocking- the changes of the people around you, your home etc (even the inventions of Ipads and stuff like Iron Man having his own movie was a brand new and ""wtf"" thing for me). I know that my jump was miniscule to the generational jump that Rogers had, but I feel that I should in some small way be able to relate to a guy a who skipped time, or at least have a better idea than most people who never had to experience a jump in time, but Ultimate Cap never did that for me."

Yeah Ultimate Cap was more aggressive than Marvel or MCU Steve, and he was more jingoistic than patriotic and his ""chauvinism"" and ""racial-insensitivity"" (of which there was barely any and he got over very quickly) were there to make the character a far more realistic character from the 1940s.

Especially when they are introduced and then defeated/killed in the same movie. That's what makes the movie for and I like to feel some type of connection or emotion. Winter Soldier is by far my favorite MCU movie because of the back story. It was brilliant. Loki was the other one because he was already previously introduced and in a way I deep down wanted him to be king...I felt for him. I actually didnt like Ultron that much because I guess I got a false impression of what he'd be like from the trailers. The first scene he was introduced I was like, ""oh this is gonna be good!""

Like I said just my opinion but their one shot villains aren't really that entertaining to me and I never once feel a threat or deep down rooting for them or genuinely hate them because they are such a good villain."

Carol's background is the military, and Bigelow is the first name male or female that comes to my mind when I think of films about them. I do think that approaching Carol from the military perspective would be good for keeping it from being too similar to GOTG."
marvelstudios,3cuzhu,AlleyOopToym,11,Sat Jul 11 20:40:54 2015 UTC,"I think it should be a male director. I feel a female director would give Marvel the permission to only hire women when it is a female hero. So once every three phases at the current rate. I want a male director for Captain Marvel and female directors for Black Panther and InHumans.  A female director would allow Marvel to say ""Hey see we hire women"" when anyone complains about the lack of female creatives in the MCU films. But a female director for male led movies would set a precedent for women being more involved in all the films.  I think they should get someone like Luc Besson, JJ Abrams or even James Cameron for Captain Marvel. A male director that is known for having female leads. Luc Besson (Lucy, etc.) JJ Abrams (Alias) and James Cameron (Terminator 2, Aliens)"
marvelstudios,3cuzhu,actuallyliamX,12,Sat Jul 11 04:49:16 2015 UTC,"No. For the first female led film in the MCU, it has to be a female director. Marvel's gotten some serious shit in the past for losing some female directors due to creative differences,hell, some were already accusing Marvel of this when DuVerany walked out on Black Panther, claiming they care more about Infinity War then the other things involving the first African led superhero film in the setting, besides, I'm pretty sure a woman understands a female character better than most male directors. They can get female directors for the other male led films, but for this one, let's get a woman's touch. Agent Carter and JJ have female show runners, and that's awesome, so why can't the female led film get a female mind behind it?  If they were, and I'm just saying, WERE, to get a male director, the only choice I would be fine with would be Brad Bird (Incredibles), the Russos, or Del Toro, and we know Del Toro aint fuckin happening."
marvelstudios,3cuzhu,JNPR1996,12,Sat Jul 11 05:04:29 2015 UTC,"I personally don't care if it's a man or a woman, gay or straight; just give me a good movie."

marvelstudios,3cuzhu,hargendarsh,4,Sun Jul 12 01:23:53 2015 UTC,"Black Panther comes before Captain Marvel and InHumans comes after it. So I figured Marvel hiring two female directors would show true intention of including more female creatives. Marvel has female creators for female led projects only at the moment. Jessica Jones has a female showrunner, Agent Carter has two female showrunners and Agents of Shield has 1 female showrunner and 1 male showrunner (They're a married couple). All of these projects have major female leads. It is what makes me concerned that we are going to see Marvel put women in the box of female only lead projects.   Won't people just see through the female director and female writers for female led film bullshit. Since you've already got people dismissing (including Gunn) the contribution of Nicole Perlman to GOTG. When if it wasn't for her Marvel probably wouldn't even have considered Guardians as a possible film. She selected comic for her screenplay back in the day.  I'd be fine with anyone on your list apart from the Russos. And they're not even available most likely due to Avengers Infinity War."
marvelstudios,3cuzhu,actuallyliamX,0,Sat Jul 11 05:24:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's kind of concerning, but still, this is the first female led film in the MCU, we got two great female writers on the film, all we need is a good female director who knows what she's doing. Just this once, well, twice, DC's doing it with Wonder Woman, lets go with the one people want.  The Russos, and Markus and McFeely, but moreso the Russos on the other shows they've worked on, have shown that they can work with diverse female characters, each different than the last. I'll give you the involvement with infinity War, though."
marvelstudios,3cuzhu,JNPR1996,8,Sat Jul 11 05:28:42 2015 UTC,"If people want a female director for Captain Marvel that is fine. I'm happy to see an entirely female led project, I just wish it wasn't the only one with women creative.  Don't get me wrong I've got nothing against the Russos. They were great on Arrested Development and Community. I just feel like they've directed enough Marvel films in Phase 3. Given they are directing Civil War and both Infinity War. (As a community fan, I think it'd be interesting to see Dan Harmon's take on a female superhero or any superhero really)  It'd be nice to have a diverse range of visions on all these films every phase."

The best director for the project should be hired. Male, female, gay, straight, trans, black, white, Latino, whatever. It really should not matter."
marvelstudios,3cuzhu,TurkCLE,-1,Sun Jul 12 07:24:27 2015 UTC,"For this one, and Wonder Woman, I think an absence of male white directors is justified."
marvelstudios,3cuzhu,JNPR1996,2,Sun Jul 12 16:16:30 2015 UTC,So technically you should want a female director for all three movies.
marvelstudios,3cuzhu,BZenMojo,3,Sat Jul 11 21:25:22 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy with that. I don't see it happening 3 single hero films in a row. Which is why I chose two films broken up by two male directed films.  (We already know that men are writing all the Phase three films apart from Captain Marvel minus Spider-Man which hasn't been announced yet as far as I can tell)  The way I see it is that side bar has 22 films on it, women should have at least had a hand as writer or director in at least 5 of them minimum. You can't tell me there aren't enough women graduating film school, there aren't enough talented women to fill five creative jobs on 22 Marvel movies over almost 12 years. (That is 44+ jobs)  I'm going to see Captain Marvel, even if a unicorn directs it."
marvelstudios,3cuzhu,actuallyliamX,3,Sat Jul 11 22:35:31 2015 UTC,"I hear what you're saying and think it has some definite merit. ""Ghettoisation"" of women to work on women characters is only a half step to actual equality.  However, your valid point does not exist in a vacuum…  We should also consider that, like it or not, Carol Danvers was designed to be Marvel's feminist hero and her military backstory involves her as a woman having to prove herself against her male counterparts.  When we consider this characterization in conjunction with their exclusively white male MCU directors to date, it would be a bit tone deaf to give this character in particular to yet another man. Not because a man couldn't do the story justice, but because it would be another instance (and a notable one at that) of hiring practices at the MCU that keep going the same old way. Sadly, the film industry's preference for men is pretty entrenched."

marvelstudios,3cuzhu,SirHoneyDip,-7,Sat Jul 11 11:59:40 2015 UTC,"The bullshit comes from getting a director, acclaimed or no, simply because she is a woman if there is an arguably better male director available/interested/outspoken about the project.

marvelstudios,3cuzhu,suss2it,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:03:14 2015 UTC,Having a female director for Captain Marvel purely because she is a female character seems insulting.

It could mean that the film has a new story arc that hasn't been done with the character which may actually help establish her in the MCU in a better way."

marvelstudios,3cuzhu,AlleyOopToym,2,Sat Jul 11 19:16:11 2015 UTC,"Kinda like Iron Man in a way. Only really big stories I knew of him before the films were Extremis (which wasn't very long), some aspects of Armor Wars, and, well, Demon in a Bottle. But the first film managed to make it work incredibly well."
marvelstudios,3cuzhu,hargendarsh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:32:43 2015 UTC,"I suppose but even moreso. At least Iron Man had those stories which they did loosely touch on, Iron Man 2 was a poor excuse of a mashup of Armor Wars and Demon in a Bottle and Iron Man 3 obviously contained elements of Extremis.   Whereas Captain Marvel has adventures in space with her cat. A blank space can be a good thing too, whoever the director is will get to put their stamp on the character more heavily probably."
marvelstudios,3cuzhu,LanePhilly,2,Sun Jul 12 01:22:29 2015 UTC,"That's why I was hoping DuVarney would direct Captain Marvel. Black Panther just seems like a tough sell to someone who probably doesn't read a lot of comics. With Carol you could practically do anything.   On the other hand, DuVarney is good at making political films so maybe Black Panther would have been cool to see her make."

marvelstudios,3cuzhu,Dray_Gunn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:13:25 2015 UTC,I think the biggest part i read in her story was basically her feeling overwhelmed by the Avengers and feeling not good enough to be ranked among them and trying to find her place as a superhero in a world full of superheroes
marvelstudios,3cuzhu,BAIIPlus,8,Sat Jul 11 11:12:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this must be a real challenge.  Captain Marvel has never been that interesting a character to me.  She's got Superman's powers and Green Lantern's origin and seems a little boring.  I have a lot of faith in these two writers though, they both show TONS of creativity that I'm sure would make even the most boringest boring character fun and exciting."
marvelstudios,3cuzhu,JohnTruant,6,Sat Jul 11 05:45:08 2015 UTC,"It's important to remember that Captain Marvel is pretty much a baby when comparing available source material. She's only been around in this form since 2012. Even GotG had been around for about 4 years with that line-up before the movie started production.   However, what draws people to Captain Marvel aren't necessarily the stories, but the character, and what she represents.  She's a fairly unique character in being a woman of incredible power, and the knowledge and skill to back it up (remember, she out ranks Cap).  At her best she represents an equality to her male coworkers, and does it without being overtly sexualized, with a fairly decent proportionality body, and the ability to save her own ass. Combine this with the ability to represent these ideals without becoming an over the top caricature of third wave feminism, and it becomes pretty apparent how she became popular, even outside comic book fans.  So you've got a good base, and Marvel has the ability to potentially draw in an entire market segment that wasn't there before... And who knows? Maybe the movie will deliver the Carol Danvers story you've been waiting for! In the meantime I'll still enjoy the stories, because they're still pretty good, fun books."

marvelstudios,3cuzhu,JohnTruant,5,Sat Jul 11 20:52:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the shift in portrayal from Ms. Marvel to Captain Marvel is notable.   At the time of introduction, Captain Marvel was the first female character to get a solo book in a while, and the name change was a fairly symbolic one. As Ms. Marvel she had always been Mar-Vell's Bucky-In-A-Sexy-Outfit. Slowly she'd been becoming more of her own character, becoming an important member of the Avengers. But by giving her the Captain Marvel name, they made her legit. In the first issue Cap even says to her ""Quit being an adjunct, take the mantle.""   They gave her an outfit that wasn't overtly sexy, upgraded her name and position from a sidekick to a Captain, and in the process made her Captain Marvel to a whole new generation of readers. Turns out she'd become so popular that she became the poster girl for the shift in Marvel's increasing popularity, and paved the way for female characters like Kamala Khan (quite literally), Spider-Gwen and the A-Force... Introducing a whole new audience to Marvel Comics... And slowly changing the perception from comics as a male power fantasy, to a form of entertainment anyone can enjoy."
marvelstudios,3cuzhu,Mike5482,2,Sat Jul 11 23:20:07 2015 UTC,"Carol Danvers had been her own character for a long time now, separate from Mar-Vell.

For example, her relationships, rogue galleries were built up in her Ms Marvel days."

marvelstudios,3cwk16,NornInstinct,3,Sat Jul 11 21:09:13 2015 UTC,"Anything is possible, but the most likely answer is ""probably not."" While it might make sense from a story point of view, there are a lot more movie-only viewers than movie and TV viewers, so bringing Coulson back into the movie fold could alienate the former (more profitable) category of viewers. Even if it's given an explanation, the studio wouldn't want to spend significant time explaining how Coulson survived in whatever movie in which he's reintroduced, but a one-line explanation could be seen as cheap and uninspired by those who didn't see the whole explanation from the show.  I remember reading something from the studio execs saying that while the movies are going to feed the TV shows, the opposite won't be true. I can't find the article now, but that seems to be pretty accurate with what they've been doing so far. So while it would be great to have more crossover or back-and-forth from the TV shows and the movies, it really makes more sense to look at them as largely separate beasts.  EDIT: Also, while I don't know the details of Clark Gregg's contract specifically, general practice for Marvel Studios has been to sign their actors to multi-film deals, regardless of whether they plan to use them in multiple films -- that way, they at least have the option to do so without having to renegotiate salaries, etc. So even if Gregg has another film left in his contract, it doesn't necessarily mean anything."
marvelstudios,3cwk16,GunpowderX,10,Sat Jul 11 15:50:10 2015 UTC,"I have yet to see an adequate explanation about how this would alienate viewers. Fury lied about Coulson being dead. That's a 5 second explanation that suits everyone. They don't need to mention any of the specifics of how he survived. Fury lied, Coulson has been secretly rebuilding SHIELD. They even set this eventuality up in the first Avengers movie with Coulson not being declared dead on screen by anyone other than Fury. The last we see of him medical personnel are arriving. And Hill points out after the bloody cards scene that Fury was lying about the cards with his response being ""They needed the push"".  Considering Coulson is becoming more prominent in the comics as well including being on the main post Secret Wars Avengers roster I bet we do in fact see him again in A3"

I've had Coulson running special missions and rebuilding Shield the way it should be. He's the one who helped me get the Helacarrier out of ""mothballs""."" There. Done. Explained.

marvelstudios,3cwk16,benos4752,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:46:03 2015 UTC,"I think that explaining away Coulson's death with something like ""Fury lied"" would be alienating simply because it seems uninspired. I don't think movie-only viewers would be satisfied with it, as they won't see any set up for his return and will chalk it up to bad writing. But more importantly, I don't think the story that the movies are weaving needs Coulson to return -- his death set up a lot of character development in The Avengers, and was one of the more somber moments of the film. Reintroducing him may retroactively take away from those moments.  Of course, this is all just speculation. I may be completely wrong -- Marvel may find a way to do justice to a short explanation, or movie viewers might not care either way about whether the explanation is ""good"" or not. It just seems most likely to me."

marvelstudios,3cuuy8,gk306,12,Sat Jul 11 01:23:42 2015 UTC,Probably villain? Conflict of who controls the new inhumans that will be popping up. He's probably recruiting the new one's for Orollan.
marvelstudios,3cuuy8,BoiledPNutz,8,Sat Jul 11 01:42:28 2015 UTC,Chaotic Neutral maybe?
marvelstudios,3cuuy8,Worthyness,3,Sat Jul 11 02:19:56 2015 UTC,"I think this is the most likely.  Lash will probably have some sort of ""pure blood complex"" like Dracula but will mostly want him and his tribe to be left alone and will do anything to keep them safe and secret. I see Ennilux coming into the fold as well. Maybe Ian Quinn as like a financer/launderer for Ennilux in exchange for the promise of power(s). Maybe ward will try to break in to Orollan or Ennilux looking for weapons and tech."
marvelstudios,3cuuy8,offthebsides,0,Sat Jul 11 03:31:20 2015 UTC,Could be that too.
marvelstudios,3cuuy8,BoiledPNutz,3,Sat Jul 11 02:25:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree. I'm excited to see if they really will reveal Orollan because it's a sizable part of the Inhuman world and opens the door for more parts of the lore like the Ennilux Corp (Attilan and the Royal Family will probably be saved for the movie though)
marvelstudios,3cuuy8,gk306,9,Sat Jul 11 01:52:28 2015 UTC,I hope he looks more like the picture as opposed to just a muscular man.  Reina has been the only freaky looking Inhuman.

marvelstudios,3cuuy8,genchris,3,Sat Jul 11 04:30:47 2015 UTC,"Sure, but look at the Flash. It seems to do just fine going full comic book on a TV budget."
marvelstudios,3cuuy8,Lord_Arachnus,6,Sat Jul 11 06:54:39 2015 UTC,I'll give you that. Flash's CG work is really good for a TV show. But it's different than showing a near-complete CG character like Lash would probably need to be.
marvelstudios,3cuuy8,genchris,2,Sat Jul 11 07:01:19 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. You could possibly do some makeup work similar to Raina's and a paintjob for the skin to pull off his appearance.

The cosmic level is out of the range of Shield and quite frankly bringing Wakanda to the world stage or facilitating Danvers seems MORE plausible."
marvelstudios,3cw63z,pdthorn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:50:16 2015 UTC,SLJ is also rumored to be extending his contract.  I expect this contract extension to be a secret if it happens so he can turn up in another movie as a surprise.
marvelstudios,3cw63z,hohndo,2,Sun Jul 12 05:46:22 2015 UTC,"Fury was practically non-existent during Civil War in the comics. He was underground at the time and I don't think he physically appeared once. Like the Hulk and Thor, if Fury wasn't a part of the comic Civil War than it's easy to imagine the movie version without him. MCU Fury is kind of in the same boat as comics Fury at the time: Underground and low-profile.  I think Hill will be in Civil War, even if it's briefly, they just haven't announced it yet. Though, her role in the movie will be vastly different than the comics. In the comics she was director of S.H.I.E.L.D. at the time and was responsible for hunting down superheroes. If she's in the movie I just expect her to support Tony Stark and take a more bureaucrat role."

Good for him for being a good sport about this.  This couldn't have been easy for him to see.

Again though, I did not like those movies and I'm glad Marvel has more creative control again."
marvelstudios,3cvi93,BAIIPlus,5,Sat Jul 11 05:41:14 2015 UTC,It may be an unpopular opinion but i think TASM (the first one) is the best spider-man movie yet. The second one was terrible but i loved the first one. I really liked Andrew in the role.  But i may be biased since i cant stand Tobey.
marvelstudios,3cvi93,Manibudo,0,Sat Jul 11 14:28:18 2015 UTC,"I don't really like the types of actors they pick for these nerd turned superhero characters. Tobey, Andrew Garfield, and Grant Gustin (The Flash) all suck in my opinion."

marvelstudios,3cvi93,odiin1731,5,Sat Jul 11 03:17:55 2015 UTC,"well you don't have to be a jerk about it, sheesh."
marvelstudios,3cvi93,Apollo3519,2,Sat Jul 11 05:27:01 2015 UTC,I liked the Miles Morales shoutout and I also liked how cool about this whole thing he seems to be. I personally really liked the Amazing movies and I thought they were perfectly casted and captured the character of Peter Parker better than the Raimi trilogy ever did. Looking forward to what Marvel Studios can do next.
marvelstudios,3cvi93,suss2it,2,Sat Jul 11 12:06:29 2015 UTC,I liked them too but I always felt they were more focused on setting up for a sequel than actual delivering a good movie experience.
marvelstudios,3cvi93,sinces,2,Sat Jul 11 16:54:54 2015 UTC,Yeah that's one of my main complaints too. Like they could never fully focus on the movie in front of them. I think that may have been some studio interference with that.
marvelstudios,3cvi93,suss2it,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:01:42 2015 UTC,"His movies were enjoyable but I felt they went too dark in tone, especially in the first one. Part 2 was a huge disappointment. Critics were touting it as 'too many villains' and 'just like Spider-Man 3' and I defended the hell out of that movie until I saw it. I still enjoyed it for what it was.   Webb's movies captured most of the characters just right but I feel Rami's films captured the world of Spider-Man perfectly."
marvelstudios,3cvi93,Tbhjr,2,Sat Jul 11 14:31:53 2015 UTC,"I agree and disagree at the same time. Raimi's spider-man was good but had little to do with the comics books, a lot less than TASM."

marvelstudios,3cwsx2,mello_keyz,3,Sat Jul 11 17:21:02 2015 UTC,"What? I think Gwen dying is a big part of Peter's life. But we've already seen that on screen so, like all the people who don't want to see the origin played out again, I think it should be something that has already happened by the start of the movie rather than spending another few movie to build up to it."
marvelstudios,3cwsx2,OtakuMecha,3,Sat Jul 11 17:23:34 2015 UTC,But the reason it's so important is because A. She's his first love and B. It solidified Green Goblin as his main villain. Neither of those things are of importance if it happens before the first movie. She and Peter wouldn't really be in love and Green Goblin shouldn't be a thing yet. I think we should give Gwen a break and have her not die in the MCU.
marvelstudios,3cwsx2,JuanRiveara,4,Sat Jul 11 19:40:49 2015 UTC,They would already be a thing in the scenario I'm talking about. He would have already dated Gwen and lost her. This new film series could be after she's dead and it still deals with the repercussions of her death on him. And also leaves it open to have MJ be his love interest once he has emotionally healed.
marvelstudios,3cwsx2,OtakuMecha,3,Sat Jul 11 19:52:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with you here, considering he will be an established hero as of Ant-Man and operating in NYC, I have no real issue with him having lost some and established a gallery of villains.   In truth I think whats more likely is Gwen Stacy, because of her iconic status recently cemented in movie goers minds will fall the wayside and instead the films conflict will center on Peter rectifying the two lives he has (as an analogue to the conflict of puberty)   Furthermore the most recent Spider-Man movie told this story, whether it is the first or second MCU Spider-Man I sincerely doubt we'll have Marvel retreading what has been told/seen."
marvelstudios,3cwsx2,pdthorn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:39:15 2015 UTC,"Sure but you don't get that same impact in exposition as you normally. You don't get to see why he cares so much about Gwen, who would be some chick we don't even know, and why this random guy who was wearing a Halloween costume would do that to hurt Peter. Peter would only be around a year as Spider-Man, not enough time to have an arch-nemesis."
marvelstudios,3cwsx2,JuanRiveara,2,Sun Jul 12 04:38:46 2015 UTC,"It hasn't been that long since ASM 2. The general public knows who Gwen is, they don't have to reintroduce her and do that whole arc again. People get it. It's no difference from people understanding that Uncle Ben is already dead but he had a big impact."
marvelstudios,3cwsx2,OtakuMecha,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:41:47 2015 UTC,I highly doubt the most people would know who Gwen is. They know of the Emma Stone character who was with Peter and died. The important part of that is Emma Stone.
marvelstudios,3cwsx2,JuanRiveara,2,Sun Jul 12 04:45:53 2015 UTC,"Um no. More people saw ASM2 than Thor 2 so I'd say a decent amount of people know. And even the details are different, the story is still the same at its base: Gwen was a girl Peter dated who he tried to save but she died which messed with him. It's really no different than the Uncle Ben situation. The details were different in both movies but people have the general idea now and him getting shot will likely be just a mention or flashback. People get it, they don't need to see it again. Same with Gwen."

marvelstudios,3ctemf,jmoney777,23,Fri Jul 10 20:00:22 2015 UTC,"That's not an uncommon mistake when people are trying to pull cars out of water.   They hooked the wrecker cable onto the bumper. Even if the bumper was solid it can't support the weight of the whole car, plus all the water in the car.   In that situation the ideal hook up would be to make a large loop with a chain around one of the rear tires and then hook the cable from the wrecker into the loop of the chain.   Then you'd pull up the vehicle sloooowly until most of the water had drained. Then you could either drive the wrecker forward, or hook another chain and the second cable from the wrecker around the other rear tire. You'd really only do the second option in a situation like this, where your workspace is tight and you want the car to come straight forward.   If you're pulling a car from a lake or a canal you'd usually just drive the wrecker straight forward.   Source: Found and recovered cars for 10 years."

marvelstudios,3ctpwh,moralless,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:51:45 2015 UTC,"Well, the idea they have is that Peter's been around throughout the timeline of the MCU in a homemade suit so we may see him in a Spidey suit in his first appearance.   Or maybe S.H.I.E.L.D. or Stark will give him one, idk."

marvelstudios,3ctpwh,NDA_Fridge,7,Fri Jul 10 18:43:47 2015 UTC,Red morph suit + blue hoodie would be awesome for his first few outings.

marvelstudios,3ctpwh,rjpugs24,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:46:37 2015 UTC,"That actually works on many levels.    That particular suit (Ben Reilly's Scarlet Spider) looks far more homemade than just about any other Spider-suit.  It would be a great way to nod to Ben Reilly and the clones without getting into all that mess (which I don't see the MCU dealing with that, but who knows). It would be a little cheaper to pull off (again the Scarlet Spider suit) and since the suit is basically a placeholder one it would make sense.   Not sure if they would go with the straight up Ben Reilly Spider-Man suit. I could see a combination of it and the original suit (like blue on the arms could stay and the legs might be the same, but I see them doing closer to the original spider-emblem)."

marvelstudios,3ctpwh,LegoStevenMC,0,Sun Jul 12 04:16:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I wouldn't have thought of using it before the MCU because pre-MCU they tended to be a bit more cartoonish with their characters and they didn't really tinker a whole lot with the origin stories (especially with their more famous characters), but now they aren't afraid to change things. And honestly this isn't much of change at all. It is one of the best options when it comes to homemade suits."

I want a brand new, original suit that distinguishes itself from SM/TAS movies that and I want to see it in Civil War."
marvelstudios,3ctpwh,testcartest,7,Fri Jul 10 20:48:59 2015 UTC,"I wanna see a costume that's like Paolo Rivera's style of Spider-Man. Essentially it's the same as the classic outfit, but the blue areas are dark enough to appear black/are just black, and the eyes are very large but are more intimidating looking - sort of like a blend between Sam Raimi's outfit and TASM2.  And overall, the costume is very clean. Also, the eyes are still expressive - I don't know if they'd be able to translate it well in film if at all, but I feel like that would be a big way to have Spider-Man be emotional while keeping the mask on at all times. And though not in Rivera's artwork, I can dig some underarm webbing if it doesn't look too bad.  Examples: 1 2 (more blue here) 3 I think it'd be different enough to audiences yet immediately recognizable, plus Paolo Rivera is a great artist.  Examples of eye expressiveness: 1 2 + bonus Abraham Lincoln and Cap"

marvelstudios,3ctpwh,three_hands_man,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:55:29 2015 UTC,"It already has, we should get something original like the Captain America suits or the Iron Man suits."
marvelstudios,3ctpwh,legopieface,-5,Fri Jul 10 23:30:28 2015 UTC,"God no! As much as I've enjoyed how Cap has translated to screen, his suit has never looked good. In fact, all the Marvel Studios suits are too busy. Too many useless straps and extras that take away from the overall design. I really don't want Spidey's suit to go down the same path. Keep it simple. Simplicity is iconic because it's easy to memorize and revisualize. Think about it, if you were asked to draw Captain America from AoU and then asked to draw the classic, silver-age Cap, which would you be able to depict more accurately?"
marvelstudios,3ctpwh,three_hands_man,10,Sat Jul 11 00:44:08 2015 UTC,It's a movie set on earth. It's a realistic tone for non realistic characters. If Captain America had wings on his head no one would take him seriously. And the only reason Comic characters have basic costumes is because they don't want to take the effort to draw a good looking character multiple times.
marvelstudios,3ctpwh,Try_Another_Please,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:03:26 2015 UTC,"I guess we just have fundamentally differing opinions on what we want from a comic book movie. I don't think it's set on Earth, it's set on Marvel U Earth. I enjoy the unrealistic elements of superheroes. Superpowers, super villains, costumes, secret identities, etc. Because it's a departure from reality and logic, I enjoy it. And it's why I enjoy the MCU; they get that aspect more than Fox and DC filmmakers.  Captain America can wear wings on his head because he exists in a universe where, by comparison to everything else, the wings aren't really all that strange and he's so confident, he pulls them off. I still think it could work.  Also, simplicity in design does not stem from laziness. It comes from understanding what makes an iconic image. The purposeful withholding of elements that add nothing significant to the whole."
marvelstudios,3ctpwh,three_hands_man,6,Sat Jul 11 02:35:31 2015 UTC,I highly disagree. Other than maybe cap on avengers his suits look amazing. I can't draw at all. Aou cap looks better on screen though and that's what matters.
marvelstudios,3ctpwh,legopieface,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:45:58 2015 UTC,"I understand the apprehension people have about making costumes that look like the comics, but look at the new Deadpool costume. It looks perfect! Why? They just made the comic book outfit with quality materials.   I still think Marvel Studios, for all the good that they have done bringing the characters to the screen, have not gotten the costumes quite right. I just hope they can with Spider-Man."
marvelstudios,3ctpwh,three_hands_man,3,Sat Jul 11 02:16:21 2015 UTC,It looks good because the original design translated well with comics to film. Iron Man's comic design was a COMIC DESIGN in the fact that if it were translated directly to a film it would look ridiculous. Same for Captain America and in my OPINION Spider-man.
marvelstudios,3ctpwh,suss2it,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:30:00 2015 UTC,"To each his own, I guess. I still hold that Spider-Man's costume is like Deadpool's, and would translate really well. I also think a comic Iron Man would look sweet. Could you imagine a kind of liquid metal effect done on the arms and legs? Really shiny. Alex Ross is a good example of how it could look if given a fair chance. I think it would look sweet."
marvelstudios,3ctpwh,Tebeku,2,Sat Jul 11 03:33:51 2015 UTC,I think if we got that version of Iron Man and not the uber cool one we got the first Iron Man movie wouldn't have been nearly as successful and the MCU wouldn't even exist.

marvelstudios,3cwbbd,tk1178,8,Sat Jul 11 09:03:57 2015 UTC,"None of his motives are definitively ""evil"" or even ""bad."" Most of his intentions and actions work to prevent harming the innocent and to protect them. Of course we know things don't always go as planned, but that is mainly what services the plot.  I'm going to assume you're not familiar with the original Civil War comics storyline based on your post.   Long story short, a group of rookie heroes go after a villain way beyond their abilities and inadvertently caused an explosion that took the lives of many, including a whole elementary school.  After this incident and a huge public backlash against superheroes, Stark decides to do damage control (physical and reputational) on behalf of the superhero community by supporting and enforcing the Superhuman Registration Act, which prompts heroes to register with the government and go ""official."" This ensures the heroes are properly trained and would also ensure that proper teams are specialized to best combat a threat. Part of this act is known as the 50 States Initiative, which delocalizes the high concentration of heroes from New York to the rest of the Nation.  The war starts when Captain America takes his stand against the Act. He felt that heroes should not have to register nor go official and should remain free agents and vigilantes. Registering would also mean compromising secret identity. In short, heroes ought to be accountable on a personal/private level rather than answering to a higher authority. Things escalate and Cap evades registration along with Anti Reg supporters, while Stark begins hunting them down and arresting Anti Reg heroes for noncompliance.  To be honest neither of them are ""evil,"" they simply have a difference in beliefs. Now the MCU version will just be a watered down version of the original story and will focus more on hero Accountability for collateral damage rather than secret identity (since no one in the MCU really has one save for a few). But to answer your question, no Stark is not evil. He will be portrayed in an antagonistic light in the upcoming films, however opposition does not always imply a fine delineation between good and bad."
marvelstudios,3cwbbd,HoennBorn,5,Sat Jul 11 09:35:54 2015 UTC,"The comic book version of Tony Stark is kinda an asshole, and ever since I saw Avengers 2, I'm starting to dislike the MCU Tony Stark. It's probably a good thing. It shows how good Marvel is at adapting a comic character to film. I can fully understand why Tony left the Avengers. He just isn't a hero. He doesn't save people because he's a good person, he saves people because the world wants him to."
marvelstudios,3cwbbd,Mamsies,2,Sat Jul 11 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think MCU Stark is a true villain, so much as he is almost a classic Greek-style tragic hero. He's a mess of arrogance and insecurity, trying to do the right thing, and inadvertently creating many of the villains he has to fight.  There's a real hubris in him. He's matured somewhat by the end of IM3, but not enough to avoid inadvertently making a global threat. Again.   But he's trying to do the right thing, he's done more good than harm, and if you catch up on the TV side of the MCU, it's blatantly clear that he inherited his worst excesses from his father, and Tony is at least trying to work through them.   Sure, in the end, you could blame him for Obadiah Stane, Aldritch Killian and Ultron. His father, in Agent Carter, referred to inventions gone bad as ""bad babies,"" and it's a hell of a term because Tony's turn out to be actual sentient beings he has to kill.   But he's also shut down the world's largest arms manufacturer, is starting to spread clean energy worldwide, and has saved an awful lot of lives in that suit. In the end, he's been a net positive for the world of the MCU.   But, I suspect, Civil War will play off of the worst parts of his psyche, with all the fear that drives him to chase his ideas to fast and too far in hopes of protecting people."

That being said I am pretty sure Ultron was not yet in his supreme form when he first performed that trick. Come to think of it, first time he used it was right after his gang found vibranium stash, then again he used it on Ironman, so it might have been electromagnetic device by then and then he fused it with vibranium so he could attract anything.

I've seen like 4-7 films with him and he is ALWAYS the same character. He doesn't change his approach to acting and therefore is nothing but decent at best.   If you want an example of a GREAT actor look at Gary Oldman. I have seen him in like 7-11 films and NEVER ONCE had I known that X character was played by him until someone either pointed it out to me or I looked it up. That is great acting; the ability to become someone else entirely and mask your own personality. McCounaghey never does that. He is always in each thing I've seen the same old, same old.

In saying no to those things, I knew work was going to dry up for awhile ... Year and a half, still nothing. At two years, all of a sudden, in my opinion, I became a new good idea for some good directors.   He got fed up with the same roles you are talking about dude. You can watch anything he's done from 2012 and on, you'll realize that he's not a shit ""good with no range"" actor. Far from it. Everybody thought he was just the Male Lead in every generic romcom and light adventure movie. Then he stopped because he couldn't get any real dramatic roles. Eventually he started getting considered for more serious productions where he has since proven that he isn't just some average actor that Hollywood used to hype up. Go ahead, watch True Detective, Interstellar, Dallas Buyers' Club, and Mud. Get informed before you shit on the guy as if people can't improve as well pursue more challenging roles.   I know good actors, Gary Oldman is one of them. I'm not really faceblind so I  can ussualy recognize people regardless of their skill unless its a much older movie. For instance, it took me a bit to realize that Gary Oldman was the DEA agent in The Professional, but thats because he was so much younger."
marvelstudios,3cz4sg,pooptuna,16,Sun Jul 12 02:33:51 2015 UTC,did you see the new batman v superman trailer? how cool is that!
marvelstudios,3cz4sg,B-R-P,2,Sun Jul 12 02:53:28 2015 UTC,It was pretty awesome. Cinema is cinema.
marvelstudios,3cz4sg,DeathFeind,0,Sun Jul 12 03:54:50 2015 UTC,This so true. The Mods really need to start clamping down on posts that have nothing to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
marvelstudios,3cz4sg,TJBacon,-2,Sun Jul 12 07:09:31 2015 UTC,"We're all here because we like superhero movies, particularly Marvel ones. I don't see why we have to be snob nazis and be so strict all the time to just MCU films. We're all fans here.  Also, if there is a thread to a topic that doesn't interest you, you can always just ignore it."
marvelstudios,3cz4sg,PowerRangersLOL,-1,Sun Jul 12 15:01:09 2015 UTC,No. What you're saying defeats the entire purpose of any subreddit.
marvelstudios,3cz4sg,EveryGoodNameIsGone,-1,Sun Jul 12 19:24:40 2015 UTC,"Um...you do know that Sony and Marvel are working together now, right? ASM3 is cancelled. The new Spider-Man (Tom Holland) will first appear in Captain America: Civil War, then his first solo movie (while a Sony production) will be a part of the MCU, co-produced by Kevin Feige, and is heavily rumored to feature RDJ's Tony Stark in some capacity.  There's a rumor that Fox is working out a similar deal, but I think that's highly unlikely."
marvelstudios,3cz4sg,EveryGoodNameIsGone,5,Sun Jul 12 04:42:06 2015 UTC,"These posts aren't about rumors of the MCU and Fox working hand in hand. They are simply about Fox/Sony movies, and nothing to do with the MCU.   Yes, I'm aware of the partnership with Sony over Spider-Man, Tom Holland, Civil War, all that. That's old news.   Are you aware that these are the posts i'm referring to?  This one as well"
marvelstudios,3cz4sg,branmuffinzed,0,Sun Jul 12 05:09:45 2015 UTC,"Had not seen those posts, no. The only one I'd seen that seemed relevant to your complaints was the one about Marc Webb reacting to the news of the deal, and even that had Marvel Studios relevance."
marvelstudios,3cz4sg,Inspace96,3,Sun Jul 12 05:16:30 2015 UTC,"You're right, it certainly does. My stance is any post whether it's a rumor/question/casting dreams/twitter posts (while maybe not great content) has a place here, so long as it has relevance to the MCU even in a small way."
marvelstudios,3cz4sg,branmuffinzed,-7,Sun Jul 12 05:20:37 2015 UTC,It's /r/marvelstudios. Marvel Studios has production credits on all of Marvel's movies not just the MCU.
marvelstudios,3cz4sg,Inspace96,13,Sun Jul 12 02:54:18 2015 UTC,"No Marvel has a credit,  not Marvel Studios.  Before the Fox films the Marvel logo doesn't have studios under it.  This subreddit is dedicated to the MCU which is a production of Marvel Studios."
marvelstudios,3cz4sg,EveryGoodNameIsGone,-5,Sun Jul 12 02:59:22 2015 UTC,From IMDB  From Wikipedia  Marvel Studios is credited on both pages as having credits on non-MCU movies.
marvelstudios,3cz4sg,rhodetolove,6,Sun Jul 12 03:05:02 2015 UTC,"That IMDB list isn't accurate,  it doesn't list any of the X-Men films, still says a Daredevil reboot is in development,  and picks and chooses different marvel related works like the animes.  That Wiki has the non MCU films listed as Marvel Entertainment productions, not Marvel Studios. It also states that Marvel Studios has so far made 12 films, which are the MCU films."
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,dillpatriot,23,Fri Jul 10 17:31:42 2015 UTC,Lots of cool stuff in AoS S1. It doesn't deserve the slag it gets.
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,bflaminio,26,Fri Jul 10 18:50:29 2015 UTC,The biggest backlash this show gets is from people that have only watched 3 episodes. In which case their opinions don't matter. AoS is amazing.
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,pacotacobell,14,Fri Jul 10 18:53:31 2015 UTC,"Going back to s1 after watching s2, I actually kind of miss how simple things were. Back when the team could just relax and tackle on the case-of-week and come out alright, I miss that."
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,Gremzero,7,Fri Jul 10 19:28:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Ever since Turn Turn Turn, the show changed drastically. That's not a bad thing at all, but you do tend to miss the simplicity of it all in season 1.    Though I think starting season 3, we might be getting some of those old season 1 vibes. With the formation of a new super team, things might be a little simpler than it was in season 2."
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,pacotacobell,2,Fri Jul 10 20:20:27 2015 UTC,"A big complaint about the first half of season 1 was the ""villain of the week"" vibe it gave off. And I mostly agree. But I think that the show needs to have the occasional one-off episode like that (that could either be linked to an episode a ways down the line or could be used to foreshadow things) just because of the nature of what S.H.I.E.L.D. is supposed to be. It would also give us a nice change of pace every now and again."
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,UmbrusNightshade,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:00:46 2015 UTC,"The cool thing about the villain a week approach in the first half was that almost all of it linked back into the second half of the season. There weren't many loose ends, so I never felt bothered by it. Just seemed like the ideal way to spend time getting to know the team and how they'd operate."
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,Harish-P,3,Sat Jul 11 10:57:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, so much. It's sad watching the pre-Winter Soldier episodes and seeing how much of a team they were. The atmosphere was so much lighter then too."
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,nullkaze,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:40:59 2015 UTC,Amazing is an exaggeration but it's entertaining. It's certainly not the best show on TV but it doesn't aim to be. It does what it sets out to do just fine though.
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,hargendarsh,-5,Sun Jul 12 05:21:10 2015 UTC,"Nope, it sucks until the episode TRACKS. Everything up to that point is yawnarama."
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,AspsVeryDangerous,2,Sat Jul 11 02:13:15 2015 UTC,It does. Just as it deserves the praise its getting for the improvements made in S2. S1 was waaay too uneven before the Hydra shakeup. The characters needed more development and they had a habit of drawing out plot threads that ended with little payoff. Also a problem that still plagues it is that too many of the jokes don't land or feel forced in delivery. Most jokes are good but the ones that aren't detract from the moments
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,thatguybane,-5,Fri Jul 10 22:58:06 2015 UTC,"The show consistently fails to live up to its potential. It's not an awful show but with great actors, great characters and one of richest mythologies in all fiction, it's frustrating that the show consistently falls victim to poor plotting, manipulative character writing, and purposeless reliance on clumsy references to other properties.  I can't speak for everyone, but when I criticize AoS I do so as someone who watches regularly and hopefully.   I love Coulson and I want to love this show but it suffers from a lot of the same flaws that plagued LOST and Heroes.  I don't think it should get a pass because it's Marvel if anything we should hold them to higher writing standards because of the love we have for these characters."
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,youmonsterikill,-1,Fri Jul 10 20:40:07 2015 UTC,"As someone who hated AoS but went back to it, I think it deserves a lot of flack for that weaksauce first season half."

marvelstudios,3ctiyo,lightningboltkid,2,Fri Jul 10 20:21:44 2015 UTC,"During the attack on List's arctic HYDRA base, the bus (SHIELD 616) gets blown out of the sky. Thus, it was destroyed. The current 'event' storyline that Marvel is doing is called Secret Wars, which involved ending the 616 universe. In short, both the Bus 616 and its namesake were destroyed in a short span of time."
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,yodamann,3,Fri Jul 10 20:32:33 2015 UTC,"I thought Secret Wars was ending 1610, the Ultimates universe, and drastically altering 616... Bringing some Ultimates characters into 616, like Miles Morales."
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,jerslan,2,Fri Jul 10 20:51:31 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell, the universe ended, and was reformed into ""battleworld"", so 616 was destroyed. Whether or not it comes back is another thing entirely."
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,yodamann,4,Fri Jul 10 20:59:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the whole thing is just weird."
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,jerslan,2,Fri Jul 10 21:05:51 2015 UTC,"Well, at the end of one issue there was a page that said ""RIP Marvel Main Universe 1964-2015 Marvel Ultimate Universe 2000-2015"" so, they both ended and all that's left is Battleworld"
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,marvelking666,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:24:20 2015 UTC,That might explain the issues with the latest SHIELD issue... where they shoehorned in a bunch of MCU references that were really really awkward...
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,jerslan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:30:13 2015 UTC,"IDK bout that because I haven't read the current SHIELD series.. However, in my personal head canon the MCU isn't affected by Secret Wars yet because we are currently viewing the history of the MCU pre-Secret Wars. Eventually, Earth-199999 will have an end just like every other universe in Secret Wars but we are just seeing all the stuff before that happens."
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,marvelking666,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:42:07 2015 UTC,I thought they explained it as something that's effecting relatively close by universes?  Earth-199999 is so far removed from the others that it may never be drawn into that conflict.

marvelstudios,3ctiyo,marvelking666,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:26:20 2015 UTC,"Apparently the MCU is part of the ""Megaverse"".   From that link:   Group of alternate universes which is larger than a multiverse, encompassing realities with a certain closeness, such as all those associated with Marvel.   So I guess the Multiverse is only affected by Secret Wars, which keeps all the movies (including thr Fox movies), cartoons and any other media that are not comics safe from disaster."
marvelstudios,3ctiyo,alexjuuhh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:45:00 2015 UTC,"In Season 2 the plane that they use a lot is S.H.I.E.L.D.-218.

By the time he's revealed as a villain you've already seen how effective he is alongside the team so you have a very good idea of what his abilities are and know when you should be scared. You also never know if he's lying or not, he probably is but you can't be sure. I'm also a fan of him overly milking his tragic backstory to try and justify himself even though he gets called out on it. That right there is a level of characterisation in itself.

We also really have no idea what his motivations are. With the events of season 2 we at least know that he isnt redeemable and clearly on the bad side.

marvelstudios,3ctixc,TheGeekVault,10,Fri Jul 10 18:00:01 2015 UTC,His character is totally different in comics and I wasn't a fan of the changes. He is more neutral. I really think marvel was afraid to have the villain in GotG be a Church.
marvelstudios,3ctixc,offthebsides,4,Fri Jul 10 18:45:12 2015 UTC,I really think had Marvel had the rights to Fantastic four characters Annihilus would be a big part of the MCU and would have been the villain for guardians.
marvelstudios,3ctixc,Manibudo,3,Fri Jul 10 19:08:48 2015 UTC,Annihilus would be really cool. Although I think they would do him after Infinity War (GotG Vol.3).

marvelstudios,3ctixc,IrishGamer97,2,Sat Jul 11 10:53:40 2015 UTC,"My favorite villain as far as development is Kingpin. I just love how they developed him, and it just makes him the most relatable of all of them.  Favorite action scenes is Winter Soldier. That fight scene between him and cap where he pulls out that knife still makes my moist.  Favorite dialogue is Ultron. Every sentence he says is pure gold."

marvelstudios,3ctixc,IrishGamer97,4,Fri Jul 10 23:27:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly. They were both very complex and captivating characters.   While Kingpin was pure evil, you still felt for him when you saw the flashbacks of his childhood and when you saw how he cares for Vanessa (Anatoly scene aside).   Ultron learned humanity was weird and terrifying after spending a few minutes on the Internet, and that's beyond accurate."

marvelstudios,3ctu28,PoliticalOutsider,14,Fri Jul 10 18:52:19 2015 UTC,I sincerely hope that Marvel never makes a Civil War story for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.   /u/ImpressiveDoggerel
marvelstudios,3ctu28,nurdboy42,3,Fri Jul 10 20:13:49 2015 UTC,I'm curious to see how he feels about Stark's and Cap's views now on the registration act.
marvelstudios,3ctu28,Daxtreme,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:38:41 2015 UTC,"Curiosity: sated!  I still feel the way I did when I wrote that. I think Civil War was wildly out of character for Iron Man more than Cap, but neither did very well in that story.  I don't know what their stances are going to be in the actual movie, but I have to assume they will be different than the comic. It's possible that Civil War could be made into a good movie, but I still think it was a story they could have skipped adapting. There are better tales to tell.   Because if they still have Tony Stark suddenly be a pro-government oversight guy then that's going to be a pretty major 180 to his characterization in the movies so far. He spent a whole movie fighting to keep his tech out of the hands of the government and has been pretty hostile towards anyone wanting to take that control away from him.  So yeah, if they use the same justifications in the movie that they did in the comics, then I'm not too happy about it all. I have confidence that they won't do that because Marvel Studios has earned my trust in the last five or six movies, but I'm still wary. If they make Cap Pro-Registration or something like that I'll be very, very disappointed.  Civil War was a mess of a storyline in the comics. I don't think it's crazy to say I wish they would have chosen something else to adapt."

EDIT: That Inhumans twist in the second to last episode of last season was solid, though."
marvelstudios,3ctu28,youmonsterikill,-1,Sun Jul 12 03:41:57 2015 UTC,"The show consistently fails to live up to its potential. It's not an awful show but with great actors, great characters and one of richest mythologies in all fiction, it's frustrating that the show consistently falls victim to poor plotting, manipulative character writing, and purposeless reliance on clumsy references to other properties. I can't speak for everyone, but when I criticize AoS I do so as someone who watches regularly and hopefully. I love Coulson and I want to love this show but it suffers from a lot of the same flaws that plagued LOST and Heroes. I don't think it should get a pass because it's Marvel if anything we should hold them to higher writing standards because of the love we have for these characters."
marvelstudios,3ctu28,BLUNTforDANVERS,5,Fri Jul 10 20:53:05 2015 UTC,"The show had come in leaps and bounds since it started. Of course it's not perfect, but it had its own clear place in marvels world and season 2 has barely referenced the other films."
marvelstudios,3ctu28,youmonsterikill,-1,Fri Jul 10 21:20:50 2015 UTC,"I've never faulted the show  for stumbling early on, but sit down some time and try to plot the character progression of Ward. He had the potential to be a great character after that first twist and almost immediately he became an inconsistent and irrelevant mess. They continue to twist characters to serve the plot and to drum up artificial tension. And every major plot twist they pat themselves on the back for is molded for shock value without an ounce of foreshadowing or consistency."
marvelstudios,3ctu28,BLUNTforDANVERS,7,Fri Jul 10 21:49:42 2015 UTC,Ward was written to be a literal mess of a person.
marvelstudios,3ctu28,nullkaze,-4,Fri Jul 10 22:04:39 2015 UTC,Ward was retconned to be a literal mess of a person. Again none of these are part of the character until it's convenient for them to be. It's sloppy writing and shows how little forethought they put into the show.

marvelstudios,3cvv4b,Draconocturum,14,Sat Jul 11 05:15:03 2015 UTC,"Tough choice. I'm gonna have to go with Kingpin. Unlike Loki, who still hasn't really completed his first arc yet, Kingpin has. Kingpin went from believing that he was the 'good Samaritan' at the beginning of the show to realizing that he is the ill intent. Now, his viewpoint is completely changed. It no longer matters to him about rebuilding Hell's Kitchen, he wants to wipe it off the face of the Earth now. He went from an evil man who thought he was doing 'what needed to be done', to a full-blown villain who just wants to see the city burn.  Loki, meanwhile, hasn't quite moved on from his first arc. He's on better terms with Thor but his death was a ruse and his goal is still to take over Asgard, rule as King and get revenge on everybody he hates...which he's accomplished most of, but he's still in that vengeful phase. He can only pretend to be Odin for so long. I think that Ragnarok will finish Loki's first arc (with the presumed complete annihilation of the Asgardian people) and he'll enter the next phase of his character come Infinity War."
marvelstudios,3cvv4b,Kaweebo,0,Sat Jul 11 05:18:32 2015 UTC,"His first arc ended in Thor: the dark world. Ragnarok is Loki's new arc. A villian is a villian, there is no vengeful phase. Fisk had to become the King Pin. Loki is loki. His tricks make him who he is. Seeing Loki on the throne was a momentary victory which will see further of in Ragnorok. Also, from Thor, Avengers and Thor (2), we saw a lot about loki's development to agree that he is the better choice."
marvelstudios,3cvv4b,DeathFeind,7,Sat Jul 11 18:01:46 2015 UTC,"I personally would say Loki. I feel with Loki you get multiple dynamics to his character. You get to see that he truly believes he is the best choice to rule Asgard(and he quite arguably is) but goes through evil things like leading the Frost Giants to Asgard though he did betray them, leading the Chitauri army to please Thanos to let him rule Asgard, impersonating Odin, etc. to get the throne. You also see that he truly loves his family especially his mother but feels they hinder him from what he feels is his destiny especially Thor.   Though Kingpin is well acted and has a good arc he isn't as dynamic to me. His love for Vanessa makes him more human sure and his love for his city gives him a clear motivation yes but to be honest, and this just in terms of being tired of this trope, the destroying the thing you love to rebuild into something better has been kind of played out IMO. He was still a great character just his motivation is a bit simple.   Both Hiddleston and D'Onofrio wonderfully portray their respective characters but Loki adds something that I feel we've seen less of overall."
marvelstudios,3cvv4b,JuanRiveara,2,Sat Jul 11 05:27:22 2015 UTC,"I'm going with Loki on this one:  Kingpin: Poor boy, abused by his father, snaps and kills dear old Dad.  Sent away to live with family, he feels drawn back to the city and to ""save"" it.  Basically by ripping it down and rebuilding it for the upper class.  But I never really fully felt like that plan was thought-out.  He only feels like he's a villain at the end, but he's in business with drug dealers and kidnappers.  He definitely wins on the personal touch, as I legit felt sadness when he loses his only friend and his draw towards Vanessa.  But Loki?  I mentioned this in another thread...in Thor he goes from malcontent little brother just trying to ruin and delay Thor's ascension, to learning his origins and freaking out (I'M ADOPTED?!?), to betrayer of the realm....all so he can double cross his real father and show Odin that he's the superior son.  He's always wanted to impress dad, and lived in Thor's shadow his whole life.  He's like Fredo in the Godfather, but actually competent.  He wants to be respected, he wants power, to rule.  And then he goes on a spree of revenge against Thor, getting involved with Thanos to conquer Earth (or purposefully fail, if you believe that theory which floats around here) and get back to Asgard to usurp the throne....and perhaps bring on Ragnarok."
marvelstudios,3cvv4b,PJL80,2,Sat Jul 11 20:48:43 2015 UTC,I think I enjoy Loki much more. (I am still 3 episodes from finishing Daredevil so that may change)  It boils down to me liking Loki more. He has parts of him that are redeemable which makes him more of an interesting villain. He does things and I think Loki if you had only done this other thing you would have been fine. Why would you do this?   The Kingpin...everytime he talks to the public in the show I cannot believe anyone would not question him. He sounds so fake and mean spirited. Then again he talks to...Vanessa with a much sweeter voice. I just cant see him as a realistic philanthropist/politician type when he is speaking to the public. He just sounds so angry almost all the time.
marvelstudios,3cvv4b,phantomliger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:20:21 2015 UTC,"That ""anger"" is likely more thought of as ""passion."" Fisk believes what he is doing is right. He thinks that he will use his power to bring Hell's Kitchen up to what he thinks it should be. It's only after Season 1 that he realizes that he can't save the city with the methods chosen (likely he feels like the city can't be saved), so he seems poised to demolish Hell's Kitchen and rebuild from the ground up."
marvelstudios,3cvv4b,Serapius,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:25:16 2015 UTC,It doesn't seem like passion though. It comes off as very...I'm not sure.
marvelstudios,3cvv4b,phantomliger,3,Tue Jul 14 00:51:11 2015 UTC,"I'd say Kingpin only for that I felt that a real human element to his character. I felt like he was just disconnected from the rest of the world and humanity and that he didn't understand that he couldn't be a hero and villain at the same time. Loki is a good character, but I rarely feel bad for him and if I do, it's only fleeting. There doesn't seem to be as much evident internal conflict for Loki. A lot of what makes Loki a tragic character wasn't even very well presented in the movies. I had to personally piece together why exactly he wanted to rule Earth and kill Odin and let the Frost Giants in and whatnot. Granted, his shenanigans, once explained and understood, make him a very interesting character, but I think the way that these doings were presented in the movies compared to how Fisk's development and doings were presented in Daredevil make Fisk a better written character in that there wasn't as much individual deduction, if that makes sense."
marvelstudios,3cvv4b,fries_in_a_cup,2,Sat Jul 11 07:47:11 2015 UTC,"Echoing the two really great posts that are already here by /u/Kaweebo and /u/JuanRiveara, I think if your question is narrowed down exclusively to who has more development I think it is King Pin at this time. However Loki is absolutely a more multi-faceted character and thus is capable of experiencing growth in different directions over the course of the franchise. Both characters obviously benefit immensely from wonderful portrayals by their actors. As some of the few surviving villains of the MCU let's hope they continue to surprise us."

Like, I had a ton of fun watching Loki and the Avengers exchange blows in the Battle of New York. Watching Daredevil, though... every single scene with Fisk was just super-tense, like he was always an inch away from smashing someone's head or revealing some vicious villain plan.  Let me put it simply: I don't think an extended scene of Loki's morning routine would hold my attention."

Just like I don't read comic books because I like the MCU is my canon, if that makes sense, I don't really like seeing actors from other universes in the MCU.

marvelstudios,3cpt6l,rooney815,10,Thu Jul 9 21:47:03 2015 UTC,I want to see a new blade as a regular on a Netflix series. It'd be cool if Wesley snipes had a role (maybe a whistler type figure) to pass the torch. They should pile all their supernatural/horror characters into one show.

marvelstudios,3cpt6l,BValen7ine,10,Fri Jul 10 00:02:38 2015 UTC,I liked him as Blade... but he is even older than RDJ. Not sure how long they could keep him around as Blade without that age starting to show.

marvelstudios,3cpt6l,RedBarrel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:27:38 2015 UTC,I wonder if having to pony up the money he owed and screwing up his career has made him easier to work with?  That has to bring you back down a few notches.

marvelstudios,3cpt6l,dra39437,7,Fri Jul 10 03:49:04 2015 UTC,Why would he not fit? He's not already playing an MCU character.

marvelstudios,3cpt6l,RedBarrel,5,Fri Jul 10 01:58:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the Blade films, but it always seemed like they dealt with things far enough ""out there"" that it would be reasonable that the rest of the MCU wouldn't know about them happening and they'd have very little reason to reference the rest of the MCU (eg, SHIELD doesn't necessarily know about vampires being real, and vampires don't really concern themselves with people like Tony Stark, etc) unlike something like X-Men or Spider-man, where we need a new start for them to possibly be included. People that have seen the movies, would it be reasonable for them to be ret-conned in, or would it be too unbelieveable?"
marvelstudios,3cpt6l,ribblesquat,12,Fri Jul 10 03:49:37 2015 UTC,"You definitely have to watch Blade 1 & 2. At at time when superhero films weren't serious movies, Blade showed everyone how it could be done. It's basically kick started the modern comic book movie. And your feeling is right. Both Blade movies take place in the shows and seedy, secluded places. The world at large would never see or know about anything that took place."
marvelstudios,3cpt6l,stormz96,4,Thu Jul 9 21:23:16 2015 UTC,They can do a soft reboot and exclude Blade 3.

marvelstudios,3cpt6l,Worthyness,2,Thu Jul 9 23:13:58 2015 UTC,I hope it was a pity meeting. The first one was fine and I love the second one but the stoic acting of Stonewall McBrickface was not the highlight. Let's get someone new who can actually convince us that he's seen some craaazy shit.

marvelstudios,3cpt6l,3MinuteHero,2,Thu Jul 9 21:36:12 2015 UTC,Perfect as Blade... Did Blade have an apprentice in the comics? They can cast a younger actor for that role instead... Snipes doesnt look like a day older than 40... and he's fit.
marvelstudios,3cpt6l,RedBarrel,5,Thu Jul 9 21:57:38 2015 UTC,To be fair he could be old these days if he was born in Victorian England like he's supposed to.
marvelstudios,3cpt6l,Robotshavenohearts,2,Thu Jul 9 21:59:03 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna say, quite politely ""No."" He's just not a good fit as Blade within the MCU as it is now. Even if you go gritty with him he stands out like a sore thumb in Hell's Kitchen.   Find some new blood HAR HAR - but seriously do. There's a plethora of great, younger actors who would relish the chance to be Blade now."
marvelstudios,3cpt6l,badphish94,4,Fri Jul 10 00:03:24 2015 UTC,Don't confuse the tone of the movies with his performance as  the character. He could easily fit into Hell's Kitchen.
marvelstudios,3cpt6l,E-Miles,5,Fri Jul 10 00:30:26 2015 UTC,He'd stand out in Daredevil.  We don't know what tone the other shows will have. Iron Fist's origin is that he punches a dragon in the heart. Relatively realistic vampires would be fine.
marvelstudios,3cpt6l,3MinuteHero,2,Fri Jul 10 02:09:44 2015 UTC,Woah woah woah. Would this mean that Blade films are part of MCU Canon?
marvelstudios,3cpt6l,IITeMp3sTII,2,Fri Jul 10 04:03:18 2015 UTC,So apparently Blade was a part of the Civil War story line? Maybe it's not too late to write him in?
marvelstudios,3cpt6l,horselover03,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:39:21 2015 UTC,"very small part, and i'm not sure marvel has the rights to any of the characters he was involved with.

marvelstudios,3ctnwk,suss2it,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:46:27 2015 UTC,"Here's a thought I just had:   What if the ""villains"" who are in the stones (under this scenario) where actually released before Infinity War (Thanos gets the stones and releases some of them in the background ... meaning like stingers at the end of films) and one or two show up in various Phase 3 films (and some could get killed for real during this time) to mitigate the costs on Infinity War? That would allow some villains to make returns while not making the 2 IW films so expensive that they couldn't even break even.  Like I could see a stinger (if this theory was the actual case) of Civil War being where Zemo (assuming he doesn't die in his first appearance like most villains) is talking to someone who is shadowed out. At the last moment that person moves into the light and you see it's Red Skull."
marvelstudios,3ctnwk,UmbrusNightshade,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:54:12 2015 UTC,"That would be cool, yes.  Would Red Skull be in Infinity Wars then?  Or is it just a method to revive him to be used later?"
marvelstudios,3ctnwk,BAIIPlus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:24:50 2015 UTC,"I think he might be in IW but if he was it would only be one film out of the two. What I'm thinking is that maybe only 2 of the villains that ""sucked into a stone"" would actually make it into IW (and one of them would only be in one part of the film; the other would be in both).   But honestly I could see the Red Skull show up in another film before IW that we wouldn't be expecting and it could show how he is still alive and how he helped Thanos (for his own schemes not because he is loyal to Thanos) and then it would give him a story arc reason to not appear in IW, but would make it appear that he could show up in the future (this scenario would only really work if Hugo Weaving would do more films OR if they did the comic book thing were Red Skull's brian/mind ... not sure on which ... is implanted into a new person so he/she becomes the new Red Skull)."
marvelstudios,3ctnwk,UmbrusNightshade,2,Sat Jul 11 05:35:58 2015 UTC,I don't think Red Skull is trapped in the stone just trapped somewhere the stone sent him.
marvelstudios,3ctnwk,Galaxy_Black,2,Fri Jul 10 19:48:54 2015 UTC,I've always assumed Red Skull was meant to be sent to Thanos to return in the role Loki did in the first Avengers movie but with Hugo Weaving not wanting to return and Loki being so popular in the first Thor they altered course.

If this is true, it's clear Fox wants to keep the rights, but have nothing planned so they're creating a throwaway movie so they aren't forced to give them back.  However, again, I'm not sure if this is how it works."
marvelstudios,3cw27t,TwitchyCookie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:27:22 2015 UTC,My thought is that Marvel will be able to offer them enough money to buy the rights back. At some point Fox will want to stop taking losses in a market that is currently booming for everyone else
marvelstudios,3cw27t,UmbrusNightshade,2,Sat Jul 11 07:30:51 2015 UTC,"I think even if this one flops, Fox will cancel the sequel they have planned (highly doubt this is a legit plan, most likely a placeholder to save the date).   Fox will take advantage of the 10 years they get just to keep Marvel from having some of the characters they have. Characters like Silver Surfer would be great if Marvel could get their hands on for Infinity War."
marvelstudios,3cw27t,UmbrusNightshade,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:34:01 2015 UTC,"But the question is: Will Marvel think it's worth buying them back? My answer is that it isn't. They would really have to fidget with their origins and backstory and outside of comic book fans, most people don't know (or like) the Fantastic Four (at least from my interactions with people). I'm thinking Marvel may buy back the rights to certain characters (like Silver Surfer, Galactus, and Kang) but not bother with buying back everything from FOX (well attempting to at least)."
marvelstudios,3cw27t,rhodetolove,2,Sat Jul 11 19:38:17 2015 UTC,"All good questions, I feel like from Marvel's perspective the more characters in their pocket the better. Liked or disliked"
marvelstudios,3cw27t,rhodetolove,0,Sat Jul 11 20:16:16 2015 UTC,"I tend to disagree. When you start stuffing characters in that aren't well received you take focus away from characters that either are well received or new characters who have the potential to be well received. Not saying that they couldn't try to make the characters more appealing, but they have a ton of characters so I don't think it would be wise to go with these over someone else first."
marvelstudios,3cw27t,suss2it,2,Sun Jul 12 03:01:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think it works that way. I think the deal is more along the lines that they hold the rights so long at they make a movie every 7 years. If this flops then they'll probably wait a few years to do it again.   Sony decided to share Spidey after it was clear they had a hard time doing superheroes. Fox hit big with Days of Future Past and seem to be doing great with Deadpool. They'll probably push their better teams to Fantastic Four if it flops. With superhero films making more money than ever, good IP is a very precious resource. I don't imagine them selling the rights for a low price"
marvelstudios,3cw5k3,TonyMologna,5,Sat Jul 11 07:30:02 2015 UTC,Tbh silver surfer's role in Infinity Gauntlet is one of the ones I'd like to see the most. From his crashing into the sanctum Santorum to warn dr strange to his plan at the end with cap and warlock. Plus it makes a lot of sense for him to be the one to alert earth of thanos. Although the guardians make a lot of sense to fill that role in the MCU
marvelstudios,3cw5k3,rooney815,4,Sat Jul 11 07:36:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it looks like it will probably be Guardians who link the Galactic threat to our Earth bound heroes.   That loose thread about Quills dad... a being of pure light; perhaps Momma Quill was blinded by the intense reflections of a horned out Norrin Radd..."
marvelstudios,3cw5k3,rooney815,3,Sat Jul 11 07:42:55 2015 UTC,That would be so...Radd
marvelstudios,3cw5k3,My-Names-Jeff,6,Sat Jul 11 13:43:50 2015 UTC,Good luck.   FOX won't let it happen.
marvelstudios,3cw5k3,TwitchyCookie,3,Sat Jul 11 07:54:08 2015 UTC,You never know. That's what people were saying about Spider-man.
marvelstudios,3cw5k3,CherryOxide,3,Sat Jul 11 07:30:58 2015 UTC,Tru. Dat.  Fingers crossed that Surfer might soon find himself at home in the universe he belongs in.

marvelstudios,3cs81w,TwitchyCookie,12,Fri Jul 10 10:29:44 2015 UTC,As hallucinations from the mind stone maybe but if Thanos actually brings them back to life I think it would be kind of lame. It would kind of make their deaths less meaningful.

marvelstudios,3cs81w,Odin043,2,Wed Jul 15 12:08:17 2015 UTC,Vision is only holding on to the stone. He doesn't need it to function as far as we know. So Thanos would have to take it from Vision first.

marvelstudios,3cs81w,dilpreet64,2,Fri Jul 10 15:00:55 2015 UTC,"No you're right, they didn't need to kill him off. They just wanted to show us that he had changed and cared about more than just his sister and himself by being selfless I guess. We already started to feel that way though based on him fighting with the Avengers.  He'll probably be resurrected through Dr. Cho's cocoon though.. right guys?"
marvelstudios,3cs81w,JNPR1996,0,Fri Jul 10 15:17:01 2015 UTC,It was one of the many problems I had with the film. We could've gone into Civil War with Pietro alive and nothing would've changed. They just did that because Whedon had a quota to fill.
marvelstudios,3cs81w,TheWinterPatriot,2,Fri Jul 10 15:20:54 2015 UTC,"Even better, it could have been interesting if they found a way to put the two on opposite sides in Civil War. But nope, gotta show how dealt the conflict is after the fight is over."
marvelstudios,3cs81w,JNPR1996,-1,Fri Jul 10 16:45:15 2015 UTC,"They didn't even deal with the conflict at the end, they just shrugged it off like how Superman shrugged off killing the only other guy in his species and almost nuking the city in Man of Steel.

marvelstudios,3cs81w,punchbricks,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:50:56 2015 UTC,"No, its a ""whedonism"" in that it's a plot device that he resorts to more often than not. Whedon gets by on quirky humor and killing characters off for shock value. Hell, he's done it since Buffy.   I just get tired of directors that need to always do films in a like fashion;Tarantino is another director I can get pretty tired of for similar reasons."
marvelstudios,3cs81w,JNPR1996,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:33:31 2015 UTC,"He essentially turned 6 different characters development wise into the same one disregarding the development they went through That's another thing I don't like about his writing of characters, they all turn into the same fucker.  Also, the shock value doesn't work if the motherfucker to bite it only got 7 lines. Y'know what would've been better than wasting him and Strucker? Making Ultron so much of a threat the other heroes actually realize how much working with one another is taxing and threatening, which is what Whedon said would happen, or some variation: ""can these people actually stand each other?"" Make it so they don't! Make it so Ultron split the group up in a really deep way, so when they come back for Infinity War, it means something, they didn't need to kill Pietro off to do that, and they just shrugged it off."
marvelstudios,3cs81w,suss2it,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:42:25 2015 UTC,"Every single director has their quirks, and Whedon's are good ones IMO. He makes you care about characters and then rips them away from you too soon. Adds more weight to his stuff."

marvelstudios,3cq537,Sogeki,16,Thu Jul 9 21:48:02 2015 UTC,Would it really be that bad if any MCU movie got a score below 60% on Rotten Tomatoes?
marvelstudios,3cq537,timetravlrfromthepst,59,Fri Jul 10 00:41:42 2015 UTC,"Probably not but tbh I just don't want to have to deal with 11 months of ""the MCU is finished"" until Cap 3 is out."
marvelstudios,3cq537,AWookieeFromKashyyyk,23,Fri Jul 10 00:46:20 2015 UTC,You've summed up my thoughts on the issue quite nicely.
marvelstudios,3cq537,the1egend1ives,12,Fri Jul 10 01:32:21 2015 UTC,"Y'know I swear I've been hearing people proclaim the death of super hero movies, or say ""Is this the end of superhero movies?"" Since....hmmmm about 2005. I specifically remember Kic-Ass coming out and people said it was the movie that would kill superhero movies. I stopped reading after that thought because the sentiment that superhero movies will imminently no longer be popular is something that I feel people talk about all the time. But it's like someone walking out onto the street corner everyday and saying ""today the stock market will crash"", yeah, eventually it will be true."
marvelstudios,3cq537,1of7billion,5,Fri Jul 10 03:07:00 2015 UTC,"As a person who has been playing Star Wars: The Old Republic since launch, I've learned to ignore Chicken Little, lol. After a few years or so, you just start to womder why they want a thing to fail so badly."

Like the other guy said, it would be really annoying to keep hearing about the drama surrounding it, but I think Marvel could use a score like that to ground them a little bit. They have quite a few bland movies that got good scores simply because of the hype at the time of its release."

My only concern with critics is they won't be able to put the Edgar Wright stuff away, to them there will always be the ""what if he stayed?"" or ""it would've been better with Edgar Wright"".  Also, this is another MCU new character intro/origin movie and yet again it has a generic villain with similar powers as the hero so that might be getting stale for some critics."

marvelstudios,3coq5b,Rapidity,28,Thu Jul 9 15:35:25 2015 UTC,Doesn't seem like there are any hard feelings between him and Marvel. Just seems like there were some scenes he thought would flush the movie out more that Marvel didn't think were necessary but will make to the DVD. Seems to me he's still proud of the film and I personally thought he did a great job. I hope he's at least a producer on Infinity War.
marvelstudios,3coq5b,JuanRiveara,10,Thu Jul 9 15:59:38 2015 UTC,"Walking out of AoU I just felt so gloomy about how people were gonna come down on Joss for the flaws of the movie. I think if he had had carte blanche, we would have seen a masterpiece."
marvelstudios,3coq5b,drod2015,23,Thu Jul 9 16:46:03 2015 UTC,"While I love and respect Joss I feel the opposite. He may have had a bit too much freedom, and if the reigns were pulled in a bit we may have gotten a tighter, more concise film. I'm a firm believer in collaboration, checks and balances throughout the creative process, and think that AOU could've benefitted from fine tuning. He still did an incredible job on both films and understands these characters brilliantly."
marvelstudios,3coq5b,Heiroglyph,16,Thu Jul 9 17:43:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure he's the right guy for a movie with a serious villain.  Loki is a prankster, so it worked for Avengers, but AoU needed Ultron to stop joking once and be the menacing guy in the trailer.  It reminded me too much of IM3, another movie that desperately needed the serious villain they teased us with."
marvelstudios,3coq5b,Heiroglyph,3,Thu Jul 9 19:21:16 2015 UTC,He could have been if he had more than 5 minutes screen-time in the movie. :(   Or more than 2 or 3 rushed minutes of anyone explaining what the hell he was/is/could be.
marvelstudios,3coq5b,Ronocm13,5,Thu Jul 9 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't think of it as him not being onscreen enough, but acting as he did, I didn't really want to hear another wisecrack.  Assuming he was serious in any deleted scenes, more of him might have helped.  It might be better once I can rewatch it again at home, but that's how I remember the movie."
marvelstudios,3coq5b,Tom-ocil,2,Thu Jul 9 20:45:46 2015 UTC,"The wisecracking stuff didnt work because we saw him so little, we didnt get much of a varied view of him.  Its like they only left his funny lines in."
marvelstudios,3coq5b,HeavyOdin7,6,Fri Jul 10 00:44:51 2015 UTC,"I think he envisioned a LOT more ultron and to show much more of his side of things. Im sure he spent a lot of time writing and filming things, but in the end, the movie was Age of Ultron (Joss' suggestion originally remember) without any Ultron."
marvelstudios,3coq5b,Flamma_Man,2,Thu Jul 9 18:01:58 2015 UTC,"Seriously I think the movie could have been seriously improved from Joss being reigned in. Every character sounded and felt the same. All using ""joss speak."""
marvelstudios,3coq5b,batter159,2,Fri Jul 10 18:14:17 2015 UTC,"I hear you, but I feel like a lot of the muddiness of the movie was the result of two competing visions in a tug of war. Had Whedon been left alone to make the movie he wanted, it may have simultaneously been more sprawling and tighter."
marvelstudios,3coq5b,GalacticNexus,8,Thu Jul 9 19:06:31 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen it posted yet but this makes me very happy. If all the scenes we missed are going to be deleted scenes on the dvd/bluray, then I am okay with not getting a director's cut."
marvelstudios,3coq5b,Tom-ocil,16,Thu Jul 9 15:53:56 2015 UTC,I'm sure those wizards on the internet will stitch them into the movie somehow.

marvelstudios,3cq7l8,ashashin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:35:48 2015 UTC,Gotcha
marvelstudios,3cq7l8,HighTreazon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:43:49 2015 UTC,"AMC Theaters puts out a poster for every blockbuster or anticipated movie that releases, but you have to see said movie in IMAX 3D to get it. They did for Guardians of the Galaxy, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Godzilla, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Jurassic World, Mad Max: Fury Road, Transformers 4, etc. For Ant-Man, here's the poster you'll get if you choose to see it in IMAX 3D."
marvelstudios,3cq7l8,Ninja_of_Athens,2,Fri Jul 10 00:01:05 2015 UTC,"I thought Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and Guardians of the Galaxy were all amazing in IMAX 3D (and I'm someone who is generally skeptical of the medium). However Age of Ultron was practically un-watchable in 3D, even with the IMAX screen... I've been kind of turned off since then, but I'm tempted by Ant-Man just because of the crazy proportions... Any advice??"
marvelstudios,3cq7l8,gorillaPete,2,Fri Jul 10 05:26:15 2015 UTC,"Man, I echo your sentiments on the IMAX Age of Ultron experience. I thought it was just me, but those Avengers Tower sequences were so hard to follow.  LOVED the 3D in Winter Soldier and Guardians, though!"
marvelstudios,3cq7l8,crapusername47,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:30:22 2015 UTC,microverse in imax 3d will probably be amazing
marvelstudios,3cq7l8,CelticTalk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:19:42 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't be in a rush to see the film in an IMAX cinema because it's a IMAX DMR film, which basically means it has been upscaled for IMAX viewing and contains no real IMAX scenes."
marvelstudios,3cq7l8,blackwhitetiger,2,Fri Jul 10 17:37:46 2015 UTC,Still worth it for the larger screen and audio system. I just wish they also host 2D Imax showings.
marvelstudios,3cq7l8,Kingslayer360,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:48:37 2015 UTC,"Has IMAX always been this shitty of a company? I'm young so maybe I'm just not remembering, but I remember them being about big picture and big sound, something that immersed you, I remember actually feeling like I was moving when the screen moved. Then digital IMAX, and upscaling? It seems like they are a step away from releasing an IMAX iPhone app."
marvelstudios,3cq7l8,bflaminio,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:11:52 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen Ant-Man in any form, but I always try to see new movies I'm excited for in IMAX. There's the obvious visual upgrade, but it's worth paying more for the sound alone."
marvelstudios,3cq7l8,EST_1994,2,Sat Jul 11 03:39:37 2015 UTC,I'm hoping to skip 3D altogether.
marvelstudios,3cq7l8,zeroreloaded,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:47:59 2015 UTC,I did. It's useless. Like really useless. There's not a single effect. Really sad. Wasn't worth the headcache at the end.
marvelstudios,3cmsgn,Kewn,67,Thu Jul 9 03:05:00 2015 UTC,It's amazing... And way over my budget probably...
marvelstudios,3cmsgn,lce-Man,36,Thu Jul 9 03:18:47 2015 UTC,"Comicave actually has their flagship store in Dubai. These guys are huge into Marvel and make really detailed collector statues.

marvelstudios,3cmsgn,andrew991116,4,Thu Jul 9 09:26:05 2015 UTC,"hahahaha nah it was like $20. there are a lot of expensive statues/figurines/etc. in the store, but they also have funkos, comics, board games, cheaper figurines, and other cool stuff."

I was thinking about how The Avengers is a milestone in cinema and how I just watched the follow up. Also it reminded me of how big the franchise is, with the original cast being prominent figures and household names, even worshiped by some, like Greek Gods in a modern era."
marvelstudios,3cmsgn,rhodetolove,30,Thu Jul 9 03:24:33 2015 UTC,"Just think, thousands of years from now, historians will probably think that we worshipped Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson as deities, or that we all prayed to a raccoon with a grenade launcher and a talking tree."
