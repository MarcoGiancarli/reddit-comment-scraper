Most users just go because you can get ""superpowers"" but this is misleading and, while it gives the sub more publicity, it damages the public view of the movement.

They claim that the rocks there were precisely cut to 90 degree angles, and as the narrator says this one of the crew is holding a right angle to a rock which is clearly about 20 degrees off of square.  They also claim that all of the stones were diorite and granite, when a quick google search shows they are actually made of sandstone.  Puma Punku is an amazing feat of ancient engineering, but its not too advanced for the Tiwanaku civilization to have pulled off.  For more information, this is a massive debunking series demonstrating their false claims.  Just be warned that the person who made this video series happens to have some unorthodox theories himself, related to his Christianity.  He doesn't do anything dishonest in order to back his views up, and most of the series is solely about ancient aliens, but there's one part where he talks about how all large civilizations on earth have a very similar great flood story.  I don't think he's willfully spreading misinformation so much as he's misinformed himself, but this is just not true.

Creams that contain aciclovir, a topical antiviral, are probably the most effective thing to use. It won't fully cure the underlying herpes infection (the virus lives dormant in your nerves and will flare up from time to time) but it might help the coldsore die down faster.   The little clear coldsore patches that you can get to stick onto the sore are also good, not because they held you heal faster or anything but because they provide a much more robust physical barrier than toothpaste will, which will keep it clean and dry, stop you picking at it and getting contaminants in it.   And remember, when you have a coldsore (especially when it's at the ""weeping"" stage) you're infectious for the herpes simplex virus so don't share towels or drinking glasses with anyone, be careful who you kiss, don't give anyone oral sex and wash your hands frequently, especially if you're tempted to keep touching the sore."

IsItBullshit,3dee3y,DrSphincter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:46:52 2015 UTC,"Well, that seems like two different problems. Space for ""trash"" (whatever that means), and conservation of scarce resources. Lots of more educated commenters in this thread have made good points about the respective energy costs of recycling various materials and it seems like plastic's kind of a mixed bag when it comes to recycling. So there's that?   On a deeper, more personal note, I'm concerned about making a future where everyone's got to be homogeneously capable and good about anything, much less where what item of garbage goes where. Relying on humans being good at things is not sustainable. Build some recycling robots, have them sort the trash, then put them at the entrance to all the landfills. Until then (like most environmentalism) recycling is more about making people feel better, not actually changing anything. We gave up indulgences in the middle ages for a reason. **"

IsItBullshit,3dee3y,GnuRip,15,Thu Jul 16 07:49:23 2015 UTC,"Depends on the material.   Metals are almost always worth recycling. The refining and mining has already been done, just need to melt it and recast. It is both cheaper and more environmentally friendly than making more metal from virgin material.  Plastics usually aren't worth it. Breaking down the plastic into monomers is either a very dirty process or chemically impossible if the polymer has been cross-linked. You can just grind it up and use it as filler, but the applications for that are limited. In the end it usually requires more energy to recycle it than to make it from crude, especially when you factor in transportation.  Paper usually isn't worth it either. Recycled paper still needs to go through the same bleaching process as virgin pulp. Unless the paper mill is set up to sort through the trash, separate out the paper and shred it the transportation costs and impact make recycling it a loser. It is almost always cheaper and less environmentally costly to truck trees from the forest right to the mill rather than collect paper, truck it to a sorting facility, sort and shred, and then truck it to the paper mill. This assumes the trees are coming from sustainable tree farms, which is usually the case."
IsItBullshit,3dee3y,yellownumberfive,7,Wed Jul 15 20:28:28 2015 UTC,"If it's worth recycling, they'll come knocking on your door asking for it. Metal, yes. Paper, no."
IsItBullshit,3dee3y,nigelwyn,4,Wed Jul 15 21:40:03 2015 UTC,So we should really just stop using plastic then? We're going to run out of places to put it one day.
IsItBullshit,3dee3y,ThisFrickinSite,7,Thu Jul 16 09:16:52 2015 UTC,"It depends.  Some recycling is bad: in these cases, the cost (in money and/or the environment) is higher than what it saved. Some recycling is good: the cost to recycling is less than what is saved, or in some cases minimal.  Paper recycling, for example, is mostly good: instead of providing wood pulp to a paper mill, you provide it with paper pulp: basically the same thing, except you didn't need newly cut trees. There might be a slight environmental cost associated with bleaching the paper (make it white again); but you sometimes need to do that with wood pulp too.  Plastics, however, aren't always so good. Some plastics need a lot of chemicals to get them into a state you can use them again; and in some cases, the chemicals required to recycle or the byproducts of recycling them are worse than the costs associated with making new plastic.  You'd have to do specific research into any given recycling program to know where on the ""good-bad"" spectrum any given recycling program is."
IsItBullshit,3dee3y,ZacQuicksilver,7,Wed Jul 15 18:10:31 2015 UTC,"Paper can be good or bad, depending on what the plant does with the shreds.  Aluminum is the absolute best thing to recycle, though.

The whole thing is driven by ideology more than economics, but it is based on something that originally wasn't total bullshit.  Here's example:   Recycling scrap aluminium requires only 5% of the energy used to make new aluminium. For this reason, approximately 31% of all aluminium produced in the United States comes from recycled scrap.   By comparison landfilling is basically free unless you're like Hong Kong and really don't have space for it."

It's much vheaper and efficient to just make more stuff. landfills don't create much of an environmental concern because they are well built nowadays the recycling industry is not self sustainable and requires government funding   No sources other than the episode, but I think they have good points."

IsItBullshit,3dcx16,Koolaidolio,6,Wed Jul 15 07:53:12 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.   It's true that perfectly healthy enamel is see-through and the dentine (the layer of tooth tissue underneath) is a slightly yellow-ish colour. So teeth with really healthy enamel would appear slightly yellow.  This isn't the same thing as discolouration, though. Enamel is composed of lots of prisms, which are prone to ""trapping"" stains. Stained teeth don't always necessarily mean damaged teeth (tea/coffee stains are harmless, for example) but people often don't like the aesthetics, so they whiten.   There are two ways to do this. One involves using peroxide based solutions to bleach the stains, change the enamel colour and increase light reflection, which makes teeth appear a bright white (enamel isn't normally great at reflecting light). This can cause transient (and often very painful) tooth sensitivity but these effects are usually temporary. If used responsibly in appropriate concentrations, peroxide-based whitening is generally accepted to cause no long term damage to the enamel. It can, however, cause chemical burns to the gums if not applied correctly.   The other method of removing stains is by abrasion, which is how a lot of whitening toothpastes work. These work by using gritty/rough material to scrub off the stains and these can cause damage to the enamel over time by wearing it away."

IsItBullshit,3d81uy,cboski,17,Tue Jul 14 06:08:58 2015 UTC,"Nostradamus was a french apothecary that also wrote several books, including a series of books of prophecies, and a series of almanacs.  When he was alive the almanacs were by far the most popular of his books, but now we all remember him for his prophecies.  His book of prophecies is actually pretty bad, even for the day.  He was roundly criticized by other astrologers for getting the dates of astrological events wrong and for assuming that if something happened at the time of past astrological events, something similar would happen in future ones.  Most of the prophecies themselves are also paraphrases from older works like biblical texts.  He openly admitted to this as well, repeatedly saying that we was not a prophet, he was just compiling and re-using the work of past ones.  Of the prophecies that people actually talk about now, nearly all of them are vague enough that they could easily be ""predicting"" multiple historical events.  Usually these are also taken out of the original context that Nostradamus would have written them to be in, much like how the end of the Mayan calendar was actually supposed to mean the dawning of a new era, not the end of the world.  If you want to know more about Nostradamus as he actually was vs. how he is currently seen in pop culture, I found this podcast to be very entertaining."

It seems every few years he ""edits"" his publication to reflect a more accurate description of his predictions. I will see if I can find it. Authors name is John Hogue...  Found it. This is from a skeptic site:  Another reason to be annoyed with Hogue is his tendency to present the quatrains of Nostradamus as if his interpretation is the standard accepted version. This combined with the sheer volume of literature that he has promoted on the subject leads to a general acceptance of his voice as the voice of Nostradamus himself. This is a problem considering the heavy revisions that he has made to his books over the years when predictions that he has made turned out not to come true. As Randi discusses on Bullshit! with books in hand, Hogue had decided in Nostradamus and the Millennium that Nostradamus indicated the anti-christ as Ayatollah Khomeini, but when AM died he reprinted his book and updated the anti-christ to be Saddam Hussein  Source:  https://skeptigirl.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/john-freaking-hogue-and-his-pal-nostradamus/"

Drinking fresh water during a hangover can make you feel even a bit more nauseous, but pedialyte is extremely easy to absorb.  Gatorade works too, though gatorade is higher sugar, and sugar draws water into the small intestine at first.  (In the long term sugar breaks down into water.  In the short term though that's not as important.  Plus you aren't burning energy like an athlete.)  I would not just pour salt and sugar into water.  Salt will give you sodium, but you also want potassium.  And as mentioned sugar won't help at all.  It's far better to drink the stuff before you go to bed.  Being hydrated while you sleep means you can wake up without feeling sick.  Trying to rehydrate after you already feel lousy works, but why would you?"

IsItBullshit,3d7hdu,im_eddie_snowden,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:55:24 2015 UTC,"Actually I was partially wrong about it.  What the fast charge schemes really do is make the phone use sources that also transfer data like laptops as if they were AC power sources.  This can't damage the battery since its still using the recommended AC voltage, but it can drain the battery of the laptop you're charging from faster.  It could be quite useful if you regularly charge from a data source.  For example, my car has a USB port that charges significantly slower than AC for no reason other than the phone sees it as the same as a laptop."

IsItBullshit,3d7hdu,Ded-Reckoning,2,Tue Jul 14 17:24:12 2015 UTC,"The only way an app like that can truly work (on android at least) is if you've rooted the phone and have a custom kernel that supports a higher power draw than the default android value.  I've never tried any of them out and would not recommend messing with your phone's kernel unless you know exactly what you're doing, but they can work in theory.  Edit:  To go into a little more detail after double-checking the specifics, ""fast charging"" can refer to two things:  1) If you are charging off of a non-AC power source (like a laptop), by default the phone rates how ""safe"" the power source is and lowers the power draw accordingly.  A kernel that has a faster charging feature will either let you modify how safe it considers a source to be, or just disable that entirely and make it default to the AC value.  There are also special USB cables with the data pins disabled that trick the phone into thinking its on an AC source when really its using DC.  2) It can also modify the AC power draw itself, but only by so much.  There are software limits on the power draw, but also hardware ones as well (like the max resistance of the motherboard or fuses that trip if you go over their rating).  You can modify the software all you want if you have android, but the hardware is fixed.  Actually, looking at more sources the only places talking about this were random internet forums.  My friend also claimed this when I was rooting my phone about a year ago, but I'm going to say that this is probably not true."

Have you ever seen the experiments where they force people to laugh and when they ask why they laughed they made up a story?   When you reach REM sleep (as well as certain other stages), your brain is converting short term memories to long term memories. In order to activate the synapses required for this, certain synapses related to consciousness and interpretation must also fire.  Basically, a dream is your brain trying to interpret your day's memories. (this also brings up old, unrelated memories). If you thought a lot about being chased you might experience that in your dream; if you're worried about the future you might be worried in your dream, too; if you feel powerless as well as feeling that you must brush your teeth you might dream about your teeth falling out.   Usually, the way your brain interprets your memories is just nonsensical. Unfortunately, there isn't much mystical or enlightening about dreaming (other than the fact that we do it at all). Dreams can sometimes reveal the sorts of things you're worried about, but a lot of the time your brain calls on old, irrelevant memories so it's really hard to tell.

IsItBullshit,3czhxb,Jokesonyounow,3,Sun Jul 12 13:32:07 2015 UTC,"Using ""dream moods"" and other dream interpretation sites or books can be a little tricky. They are akin to utilizing a very dull tool to interpret the very complex state of your internal world. We dream in primal symbols and it has been said (by Jung) that everything in your dream is a representation of you, a mirror into your psyche. So, dreams can be a very powerful tool for understanding our circumstances in real life. Some dreams hit us over the head with painful information that we do not dare register in our daily consciousness. Therefore, these repressed emotions surface in our unconsciouness mind when sleeping. I highly recomend writing down your dreams in a dream journal.     Some of the evaluations on the above sites are too cut and dry and don't allow for personal interpretation. ON the other hand, they can also can be a somewhat decent jumping off point to ask yourself about what you think your dream meant. This is due to the fact that  we are often too close to our dreams to fully understand their true significance. If Dream moods suggests that dreaming about something has a specific meaning each time than it is not allowing for your own personal experience with the specific subject matter. So make adjustments as necassary.   Freud and Jung, among others, felt that they could glean significant insightful data from dream interpretation, which in itself, is definitly not bullshit when employed by a well trained psychiatris/psychologist. Historically speaking, Shamans of many cultures, American Indians etc. also weighed heavily toward the utilization of dream data. To summarize, dream interpretation is an art form that takes time to master. Perhaps you might like to read up  a bit on jungian analysis."

Furthermore, a serving of juice just has way more sugar than a serving of fruit (as much sugar, if not more than the same amount of soda).  A glass of orange juice contains 4 oranges worth of sugar.  It also has a fraction of the fiber content.   A medium 3.5-ounce orange has approximately 2.3 grams of total fiber, or more than 8 percent of your total daily needs for a 2,000-calorie diet.

You're a big dog. You are attacking my hand. I cannot free my hand, so I shove it down your throat and you cannot breathe. What is going to happen?  You're either going to freak out and let go, or die choking on my hand.   I think it's more of a thing to keep in mind than a thing to definitely do."

Unfortunately, I found it really difficult to search for a reference for what I'm trying to describe.  I'm sure this is just something I saw on reddit before.

More realistically the dog will be on your arm, shaking its head furiously. We're assuming you're in a frame of mind to decide to do anything - i.e. ""do I shove my hand down it's throat? do I poke its eye out?"" - and so if you are, you should focus your energy on grabbing one hind leg and then the other.

You need to grab the dog under the jaw, roll it's lip over a tooth and press down until it releases, then hopefully pin the dog. Second,  a husky bit fast and quick like jabs. The dog is defensively attacking, just scare it or get away. Third, the chow hits fast and hard. There's nothing you can do except hope he doesn't hit again. In all cases, stay on your feet."

It's not the immediate release you'd expect, or experience with a human. You gotta remember, when a dog goes into attack mode it goes into a form of primitive survival instinct that'll throw normal rules out the window. The only thing that's breaking up that fight is enough damage to make the dog stop. Even pain won't do it on some breeds, damage is necessary.  Sad, but true."

IsItBullshit,3ck2wr,hesheheman,27,Wed Jul 8 15:03:46 2015 UTC,"Motherless started off with a bit of a sketchy beginning  because it was basically an unmoderated (or under-moderated) video upload site. Any website that allows free uploading from potentially millions of people is going to have a some dodgy shit hosted there.  That was years ago and since then the moderators have cracked down and it's against the rules to post anything illegal on there. Sometimes it gets through (not every website has the manpower and processing power to automatically scan millions of uploads like Youtube), but it'll be removed asap if found.  TL;DR: It's not a honeypot, it's a very popular and 'raw' website with a focus on porn. You might not like what you see but it's all legal (surprisingly enough). Oh, and you can find motherless on Google in 2 seconds, so much for a 'secret' hangout for criminals."
IsItBullshit,3ck2wr,Lagsta,3,Wed Jul 8 16:19:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, reading this has told me two things:  1.) Anyone who truly knows if it is a honeypot can't say anything because they're part of an ongoing investigation and wouldn't jeopardize that for karma.  2.) Anyone who claims to know, especially on /b/, could possibly be lying, in fact that's most likely since their banner says it's to be taken as fiction.  Which still begs the question of whether or not this is bullshit or not bullshit. There's really no way of knowing unless you're an FBI agent or if you yourself decide to look up CP and wait for the SWAT team, and I don't think you want to do that. If it has a reputation ranging from videos which are sketchy at best to full on CP, my advice is to just stay away."

IsItBullshit,3chbu8,3dx4d,15,Tue Jul 7 22:26:39 2015 UTC,"You can do it, but you really need these things to make it profitable:  1) Spouse (or business partner) who is a realtor. 2) Other spouse (or business partner) handy with light-to-medium remodeling jobs from tile to sheet rock hanging to counter top replacement, etc. 3) Being able to quickly, and inexpensively, turn around a light fixer-upper sort of home in less than a month or two's time 4) Sell this same home to someone else before you have to make the first (or second) mortgage payment on the property i.e. ""the flip"".  The more mortgage payments you have to make on the property you are trying to flip, the less profit you are going to see, and you have to watch your remodeling materials expenses light a hawk, so you don't go far over budget.   If you haven't done this sort of work, it could get you into a bankruptcy situation very quickly. If you could apprentice with a carpenter who works with a realtor who does this sort of gig for a living, or apprentice with a realtor if that's more your speed, you can make money in it.   Source: I knew a husband-and-wife team who some years ago were doing this very thing. He could do most remodeling jobs, and she was an established realtor. I heard him describe some of the basics, and then of course there are all the DIY shows on television that cover the basics of what's involved.   You must have re-modelers you can trust if you're going to keep to your schedule and not go far into the red trying to remodel a home on a schedule. And then your realtor partner actually has to be able to sell the homes. It's not work for the faint of heart, but if you can establish a pipeline of houses to do light remodels to and get them sold for the right price, you could make some money. But it seems like it would take a lot of work and sweat equity on both sides."

If the housing market stays steady, then the work you put in, especially if it is cheap work that makes a huge difference, will make you a profit. And if the housing market is handing you rising prices, making a profit is easy.  However, if housing prices go down while you're holding a house, you could get stuck with the house (and the mortgage). And this is why I call ""BULLSHIT"" on the ""No risk"" part."

IsItBullshit,3chbu8,derleth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:55:02 2015 UTC,"I concur with both of your comments. If a person were going to do it, the safest thing would be to incorporate a small business and run all of the finances legally through that small corporation, so if the business you incorporated to flip houses went under, your business and whatever assets it held could be sold off for pennies on the dollar in bankruptcy court, but your personal finances wouldn't be touched as long as those were never made part of the small corporation.   But the realtor and carpenter/remodeler would both have to know how to do their respective jobs impeccably, and every house sold is always about location, location, location. Buying homes in the right neighborhoods that will sell quickly enough...this would be inherently risky as your team is competing against other realtors intent on buying the exact same houses i.e. the ones that are cheapest to fix up and flip, and if you weren't being taken under the wing of someone who has done it for a living, knows the ins and outs, and is willing to teach you over a period of years, you could easily lose your shirt and everything else without good mentoring.  It's better than Amway, but seems incredibly high risk if you have no prior experience. Buying a small house and fixing it up as a rental property would give you a second stream of income without the Vegas odds that house flipping could very likely involve."

Catcalling happens, it first happened when I was about 12 years old walking home from school and it hasn't really stopped since.   It happens so frequently though that you stop caring and become immune to it.   It doesn't tend to happen when I'm with a guy though, so it's likely that your presence is preventing it happening.

They're keen to impress their mates and the easiest way for them to do it is by objectifying women.  Most likely to be catcalled when I'm alone or in a seedier part of town.

IsItBullshit,3cd3rf,1ucy,2,Tue Jul 7 19:40:30 2015 UTC,How is it not objectification? Catcalling is one of the most common examples given for what objectification is. It involves seeing someone as a body that's only there for their entertainment before seeing them as a human being. Why is it a stupid word when it's one of the neatest summaries of what catcalling entailsm
IsItBullshit,3cd3rf,madhawkhun,0,Tue Jul 7 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"Objectification is seeing someone as an object, not a person. It is perfectly normal and natural to see an attractive body and think ""woah, he/she looks hot"", everybody does that, you can't see his/her personality and it's 100% natural for heterosexual men to lust after an attractive woman and vice versa. The problem isn't objectification, as it's just a biological reaction to a sexy body you don't know the owner of. Asking heterosexual to change being attracted to attractive women is like asking gay men to not be gay.   Your problem is with certain people (men AND women) letting you know that they find you attractive, it's fine if you don't like that, but it's their right to speak their mind, you can tell them that you don't like it and that's it.   Please mind that I'm talking about catcalling and NOT harassment, that's a legitimate issue and you can notify police about that."
IsItBullshit,3cd3rf,1ucy,2,Thu Jul 9 08:38:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not asking people to stop being attracted to each other, please don't put words in my mouth. Instead I'd like to see people (overwhelmingly young, male people) stop expressing this attraction in the form of lewd gestures and obscene language yelled from passing cars.   Just because it's legal to do something and it falls under free speech doesn't mean you're not a really shitty person for doing it.   It's one thing to come up to me on the street and say ""hi, I just wanted to let you know that you look really lovely today, that's all, please enjoy the rest of your afternoon"" (still not a comment I'd actually welcome for a whole host of other reasons but an improvement at least) But ""hey baby, show us your tits!!"" Is not quite on the same level and definitely not something I'm keen to defend. Furthermore, being unattractive doesn't make you immune to being catcalled, the comments you get can just be much more cruel. Catcalling is not people expressing a genuine appreciation for another persons body so please try not to categorise it as such.  Most catcalling in my experience is harassment. And if I reported it every time it happened I'd never get anything else done. What type of catcalling in your mind isn't harassment? I'm honestly curious."
IsItBullshit,3cd3rf,madhawkhun,-1,Thu Jul 9 09:31:39 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I wasn't trying to put words in your mouth. I tried to say that,  objectifying someone you don't know but are attracted to is inevitable and is NOT a bad thing, it's perfectly normal. Originally this is what I took issue with, not the part that catcalling is unwelcome and only assholes do it.  I'd like to make it clear that I don't condone catcalling either, I would never do it and I wouldn't want anyone to do it. But whistling or yelling ""hey there sexy"" at someone is very far from harassment in my opinion. Harassment has an aggressive and/or persistent element to it. A guy that follows you to your home, or keeps yelling at you or coming up to you, or grabs your hand or any part of you IS harassment, and I'd report that definitely.  Also I'd like to say that I'm not from the USA, and honestly I never encountered catcalling in my country, it might still happen, but if it was that common I probably would've encountered it. Apparently many other people even from the USA don't encounter it, so it seems to be a local trend or something.  Honestly you can't do anything about it except tell them to fuck off, and I agree, they are a really shitty person for doing it."
IsItBullshit,3cd3rf,1ucy,2,Thu Jul 9 13:05:24 2015 UTC,"Harrasment: In the legal sense, it is intentional behaviour which is found threatening or disturbing.  When you're alone and have a guy who's larger than you and physically stronger than you yelling stuff while a bunch of his mates look on and laugh. It can be pretty threatening. When you consider that 1 in 3 women in America will be sexualy abused in their lifetime it can definitely cross the line into disturbing. Telling them to fuck of encourages them. They've gotten a response out of you now and will conyinue to try and engage you. All you can do is ignore them and that can be really difficult at times.  Just because you don't see it as a particularly agressive act doesn't mean it's not percieved that way by the victim. What if you're the one that becomes the 1 in 3?  Furthermore, the only people in this thread who have said that catcalling doesn't happen are guys saying they've never seen it. As I said earlier, it's much less likely that a girl will be catcalled when she's with another man. So take what they've said with a large grain of salt.  Out of curiosity, whereabouts do you live? Because if it's actually somewhere where I will be able to live my life free from constant verbal assult I'd be very interested in moving there."

Also, the 1 in 3 women are sexually abused seems a bit of a stretch to me, can you show me what studies support this?  According to http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/harassment harassment is the act of systematic and/or continued unwanted and annoying actions of one party or a group, including threats and demands, so there is a persistence and/or aggressiveness involved."

However, it may be worth noting that I get accosted by the same types of people with a fair degree of regularity.

It made me incredibly uncomfortable, I had never interacted with boys romantically at this point (girls school), so to have far older men yelling sexual stuff at me was alien and horrible. I had also been taught that older men who found young girls attractive were dangerous paedophiles, so I couldn't understand why this seemed to be ok.  It definitely happens less now. I don't know if it's because men do it less, or just do it to me less. I'd say I get a few comments a month. They are very rarely outwardly aggressive, but I still hate them as much as I did as a kid.   Edit: One thing I find especially annoying is that sometimes a man will just make a completely normal friendly comment to me, that you can tell he would make to me regardless of gender and isn't meant in a lecherous way, and it always takes me a few seconds to get my guard back down from assuming he was about to say something inappropriate. I really hate this because it makes me seem rude and I don't want men to feel like they can't just talk to women they way the would other men. Sadly, my guard is there because the majority of times a stranger does talk to me, I need it."

The hell right dies anyone else have to tell me what to do with my face??   People will say that saying ""hello"" or ""good morning"" isn't catcalling, but imagine how many times you've randomly stepped into another dude's path to say ""good morning"" to him. Just a stranger on the street, walking by.   This is something people say to get your attention. Once you acknowledge them it escalates.  Catcalling is real, 100%.

I don't think it is as common for catcalling to occur when a woman is with a guy friend, so for people like myself learning that other men do that came as a surprise. I think the denial you might encounter comes from guys wanting to distance themselves from those who harass women on the street. Also genuine surprise and disbelief, because it sounds pretty absurd.    And just to clarify, you aren't saying that people shouldn't say hi to strangers are you? Because I say hi to people I pass on the street on a regular basis and it's never occurred to me that someone might compare that to catcalling.

I almost didn't notice it because I was so focused on looking for my friend that I practically walked through him, and after the fact I just thought, wtf, who does that to someone.   I compare myself to a friend of mine who is very good looking, and she would be approached constantly. We worked together and dudes would come into our job pretending to want to do business just to talk to her. Walking around in the mall, I could overhear dudes making comments, or see them actually pointing, it was so freaking creepy.

I'm aware of the threads you list, I'm also questioning the external validity such sampling has. I asked every woman who is closest to me in my life and none had experienced catcalls, but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Just like just because a bunch of people reported getting catcalled in a thread doesn't mean it's a overwhelmingly common phenomenon.   For you to claim my wife or other members of my family are lucky is utterly uninformed by any study whatsoever and should only be regarded as the anecdote that it is. This sudy clams 45% of women experienced street harassment in their entire life, that's a flip of the coin, hardly lucky.

I will also note, for full disclosure that that article also contains the following statement: ""In a third study, conducted in Indianapolis, researchers interviewed 506 women and men about street harassment; remarkably, every woman in the study could cite several examples of being harassed..."" I am from Indianapolis, so it could be more regional than I thought.

The first study is literally my source in my last comment, with which you misrepresent (possibly erroneously) the statistics, and so does the article that cites it. From the text itself ""More than half (57%) of all women had experienced verbal harassment"". You're lumping the violent/verbal harassment stats (65%) in with the verbal, that's a dishonest representation of the data and gets us back to a coin flip of ever getting catcalled in your entire life.  The second article cuts off their cited sources entirely, so I can't take it seriously.  The third is an online survey (really dude?) done via Cornell and could be spammed or manipulated by brigades, and being that you are familiar with reddit I take it you can see how brigading might lessen the validity of their results. Notice their report was unusually higher than the other figures cited ITT?  Finally, if there is such wild variation in % harassed across polled populations then there is an enormous confounding factor at play here, very likely in their methodology given they all had significantly large sample sizes. This is trash science at best and a total waste of the researchers' and my time.

The closest I can find is a 45% for women and men, meaning that figure is likely skewed significantly downwards from what women alone experience. In fact, right above where it says that, it says, ""Sixty-five percent of all women (two out of three women in the United States) said they had experienced some form of street harassment,"" which supports the figure I used.

The correct citation was in my last post for ""verbal harassment (57%)"".  The comment I made about it happening once in their lifetime is important, because that is the only statement you can accurately make given that datum of """"More than half (57%) of all women had experienced verbal harassment"" that I mentioned in my last post. ""Had experienced"" being the key phrase, that means ever in their lives.  The article continues and explains that ""Eighty-six percent of women and 79% of men who reported being harassed said they had been harassed more than once."", but all that really tells us is that it happened twice at least to that % of women, and it only states that women were more likely than men to experience catcalling daily, and it gives no real data on what % of women that actually happens to.

But I think now its generally considered to be pseudo-science. Though it seems there are studies that show that its possible to reinforce existing memories while asleep but not learn new information. This makes sense considering that dreaming, as we know it, is the equivalent of the brain's maintenance program; filing, categorizing, and deleting the memories and experiences we learned over the course of the day.   Essentially its all of our short term experiences cache being dumped out and sorted into long term memory or being deleted out right. The new long term memories then have to be physically encoded with new neural connections and woven seamlessly into the existing neural network. This triggers the randomness of dreams as the neural network is developed, cross referenced, and triggered over itself. A neuro-psychologist can explain it better, but that's the gist I got of it.  Edit: Wow I digressed. Sorry about that."

Individuals with various parasomnia disorders exempt obviously. (Having conversations with sleep walkers for example) However, I did best on the tests where I studied for a few hours right before bed and purposely didn't think about anything else while going to sleep. The trick being that those memories would be fresh in the cache and would be processed first without being cross-distorted too heavily with junk memories."

IsItBullshit,3c7cp8,Weeabo_vanquisher,15,Sun Jul 5 15:53:04 2015 UTC,"While I'd avoid this particular personality test (and call it fairly bullshitty), there are a few that have been shown to be fairly valid. The Myers-Briggs personalty test, based off of Carl Jung's theory of the 16 personality types, has been shown to have good reliability (that is, the results of the test are fairly consistent no matter how many times it is taken by a person) as well as good validity (that is, it actually measures what it is supposed to measure [personality] well).   This test (and the ten questions it asks) seem to try to determine your basic temperament and may try to reach from that to make further claims about you (""Ok, he answered he worries about big projects, worry can lead to intestinal problems."" etc.). It's kind of like cold-reading that stage psychics do, it's vague enough based on what little information you give to be at least partially correct, and if not: no big deal, at least one of the other statements of your personality will stick.  As for Dr. Ritberger, the psychologist who created this test. I can't find much on her. She has her own website that is filled with self-help materials, training and seminars, a gift shop, a link to her radio show, and a blog. She isn't the lead author in very many scholarly articles I can find, but her name is included in a few of them. Not to discount her based on her degrees, but it turns out her doctorates are in Theology, Esoteric Philosophy, and Hermetic Science. The straw the broke the camel's back for me, in her biography on her website was the passage:        ""As the result of a near-death experience in 1981, she is literally able to see the human energy system, the aura, to identify energy congestion, protrusions, depletions and blockages that are affecting the body's ability to function properly and sustain good health. Using this skill she is able to offer a comprehensive picture of why we become ill and offer insight into what is needed to heal.""  This seems like pop psychology to me."
IsItBullshit,3c7cp8,celt1299,16,Sun Jul 5 16:42:03 2015 UTC,I've heard the exact opposite about the Myers-Briggs test. Do you have any sources for the good validity and reliability?
IsItBullshit,3c7cp8,EtaoinGuitardlu,6,Sun Jul 5 16:58:10 2015 UTC,"Most articles on it are are quite dated (1980s or so), I found this one to be slightly more current (2002).   It essentially reports that the test itself is fairly reliable, and much of the error comes other circumstances outside of the test. This is summarized in the abstract: ""The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) was submitted to a descriptive reliability generalization (RG) analysis to characterize the variability of measurement error in MBTI scores across administrations. In general, the MBTI and its scales yielded scores with strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability estimates, although variation was observed."" (591)   Reliability is strong over time, and when variations do appear in test-retest reliability, it is fairly minor and usually only in one of the categories, especially when the distinction between the two types was relatively small (594).   The validity of this test is found by comparing it to other personality scales as well as self-reflection by the person taking the test (594). Overall, when it comes to validity of the MBTI: ""Statistically significant correlations have been found between MBTI scores, behaviors reflective of MBTI constructs, and persons’self-assessment of their own MBTI type"" (594). This correlation was found to be strong (594).  According to this study: ""Overall, the MBTI tended to yield acceptable score reliabilities."" (596). However, a major barrier to the test's reliability is the differences between populations, between which there are large discrepancies in scores. This means that the test's reliability has to be examined within each sample (596)."

Especially when it's a self-test.  All personality tests are flawed at their core:  Interpretation  Extremely vague questions will result in inaccurate answers.   You like to be engaged in an active and fast-paced job   How active is active? How 'fast-paced' are we talking?   You enjoy having a wide circle of acquaintances   10? 100? How wide is 'wide'?   You usually plan your actions in advance   Weeks? 5 minutes?   You often think about humankind and its destiny   Yeah, once a month is really often right? / Not really, only maybe once a week.

IsItBullshit,3btcy3,nguyen_,17,Wed Jul 1 23:59:44 2015 UTC,"A good way of looking at this is with coin tossing. Say you get 5 heads in a row. Should you bet on heads next because it's ""on a roll""? Or should you bet on tails because it's due to come up next? Probability states that the chance of another head is pretty slim, right?  No, it's still 50/50. The bottom line is that each discreet coin toss is independent of the last. It doesn't ""know"" that it hasn't had a tails for a while. It just happens. We may create a pattern and deduce that there's some kind of divine plan to it all, but the fact remains; the actual chance is still the same.   People talk about odds/evens, 1 2 3 4 5 6, numbers that come up a lot and all that. But it doesn't make any difference. 1 2 3 4 5 6 has the same chance of being drawn as anything else, it's just that it's one of 14 million random combinations that has meaning to us.  Sure, a lottery is more complex than a coin toss because you're drawing six numbers. But it's still 6 random events from the same pool with the same chances. You can talk about probability/statistics and all (ie consecutive numbers are considered less likely) but it doesn't change the fact that the numbers are all random, every time.   I do the lottery and I picked my numbers using a random number generator. I kept going until my lucky number 37 came up, and then just stopped and went with that. I made sure that it had never been a winning combination before, but I didn't question the numbers for their perceived randomness/spread or anything like that. And I was aware that it didn't particularly matter if they had won before or not.   Someone else might have a better answer, but that is my perspective!"

What you can do is change how much variation you'll experience when you buy multiple tickets to the same lottery. For example, perhaps you had the ticket ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5"" and you were considering between ""1, 2, 3, 4, 6"" and ""6, 7, 8, 9, 10"". If you go with the first option then there are more pulls that match zero of your numbers, but pulls that match some of your numbers likely match both tickets. If you go with the second option then more pulls win but they don't win as much. The expected value is the same either way, but you can modify the likelihood that you win  anything at all and the amount that you'll win when you do win.  The other thing you can do is avoid tickets that will likely be bought already. There's the popular TIL about lots of people winning the lottery when a fortune cookie company guessed right and printed that combination on thousands of cookies.

But it penetrates the skin, gets into the bloodstream and acts like estrogen in the body. It can trigger allergic skin reactions. Some research studies, while not conclusive, have linked higher concentrations of oxybenzone to disorders, including endometriosis in older women and, lower birth weights in newborn girls.   4) Retinyl palmitate   Nearly 20 percent of the sunscreens and SPF-rated moisturizers and 13 percent of SPF-rate lip products in this year’s guide contain retinyl palmitate, a form of vitamin A. Night creams with this chemical may help skin look more youthful. But on sun-exposed skin, retinyl palmitate may speed development of skin tumors and lesions, according to government studies. Why does the FDA allow this “inactive ingredient” in sunscreens intended for use in the sun? The agency has been studying the chemical for years but hasn’t made a decision. We have. The definitive study may not have been done, but we think we know enough to believe you’re better off without sunscreens with retinyl palmitate.   My cousin, who is a Dermatologist and clinical researcher didn't seem to be too concerned, but she did advice using physical UV blocker protection (zinc oxide or titanium dioxide) as apposed to the chemical UV blockers such as Oxybenzone."

It's not clear if the dosages in that toothpaste and their exposure times are sufficient to produce the observed effect, however. Be aware that theobromine is actually toxic to humans. But at sufficiently low doses, it has some desirable and even therapeutic effects.  It's reasonable to presume that the dose in that toothpaste meets federal guidelines for safety, and you shouldn't worry about it, as long as you use it as recommended. However, it's unclear whether those safe levels are high enough to produce the desired benefit.  I'd say that you've got nothing to lose for trying, though. Any toothpaste is better than none, especially if it's ADA approved. The next time you see your dentist, ask them about it, and ask them to examine your teeth to see if they notice anything related to this."

None of this is based on an actual plan to do this. It's basically just one person stating an opinion and another person objecting to that opinion.

As far as the government is concerned, you're not married unless you file the paperwork, which the churches aren't even a tiny part of. You can get married without going to a church, and if you get married at a church then the guy in charge has to be given the power to marry people by the government anyways.  So racist churches that didn't hold ceremonies for interracial couples were completely ignored, which is what's happening in this new gay marriage thing.

You can't choose your initial reactions, but you can choose how you act afterwards. People can change.  I'm going to stop here.

So they use scorn to ignore the point of an article. Clearly this person isn't all that interested in a discussion based on the subject in the first place.  'No, and I don;t know anyone who believes this. The author seems to be confusing the words ""can and cannot"" with the words ""should and should not.""'  This is called the 'is/ought' fallacy.  People, especially nowadays and ESPECIALLY progressives it seems are so convinced they are allied with the correct way of doing things they don't even need to explain themselves. Racism is wrong because...it is. No need to look into the why.  And my making that statement just there would cause this fellow probably to say 'SEE? Dan says racism is perfectly fine!' No...that's not what I said. I said you need to think through why racism is wrong besides just saying 'It's wrong because everyone knows it is' or something to that effect. That's not an argument.   'Yes, they can. Many people have had their views changed on these issues. It's not hard. Exposing yourself to other cultures (even if only through movies) will clear that right up for ya.'  The shooter of nine people in a black church in Charleston walked into the church, talked with the people there for hours THEN decided to kill them.  I'm afraid the idea that goodness is programmed into humans and can be activated just by dealing with other people is sadly misjudged. Knowledge is power, but power is not moral goodness.  'I just wanted to quote this for the benefit of anyone reading my comment. This is actually in the article. Yep, that's what we're dealing with here.'  Again, why bother saying WHY something is wrong when you can just say 'Look how wrong this is' and step back? Apparently this fellow doesn't have to explain himself very often.  'This article is going to change no one's mind.'  Clearly not his. Sort of gives the lie to his statement that you can change your mind after you're exposed to new things, doesn't it? Some people willfully don't.  And his accusations that I WANT racism and hate speech are unfounded. I'm just saying no one seems to think about such things apart from just calling them wrong...and his 'rebuttal' basically serves as another example of how complacent we've become.  Why is it wrong? Because liberalism says so. Any more reason needed?"

There is a strand of historical revisionism that claims Hitler's mind was on other things when the holocaust was being planned, as if that somehow absolved him of complicity in its conception and execution.  Irving was big on research and primary sources, but he tended to be very selective in the use of sources, leaning always in a direction that cast his subjects in a good light. As a consequence you can't trust his books. It's sad, because his first book - about the PQ-17 convoy - was well-written and appeared to have no political axe to grind at all. He didn't even bring up the theory that PQ-17 was deliberately sacrificed.  My impression of Hitler is that he was interested in the grand sweep of strategic policy and in tiny little details, such as the rates of fire of artillery pieces and the ranges of U-boats, without being interested in anything in between. He strikes me as the kind of man who would set a nation on a course to exterminate millions of people, and take great interest in the siting of machine gun posts, without caring much about the boring uninteresting details of how it would all work and what it was all for.

My google-fu names the following sources: * Science (1998;279:396-398)  From here :  The 1998 study, published in Science, seemed to demonstrate, astonishingly, that light absorbed through the skin could adjust sleep-wake cycles in the brain. The idea was that 'photic' signals are carried from the back of the knee to the human brain via the circulatory system. Some invertebrates seem to have a circadian response to light shined on various body parts, but for humans, many researchers have long thought that only the eyes could do the trick.  (...)  The new research, also published in Science, seems to refute the 1998 work effectively by maintaining many of the first study's experimental conditions.  (...)  Most important, the Harvard researchers took greater pains to ensure that the subjects' eyes were shielded when light was being shined on their knees.   (...)  Because of these changes, the results for the 'light-behind-the-knee' group and the 'no-light-at-all' group were virtually identical. The bodies of the subjects whose eyes were exposed to light seemed to reset themselves, registering the three nighttime hours as the beginning of the day. No such internal-clock resetting occurred in the other groups, regardless of whether or not bright light hit the back of their knees."

The same thing goes for dog food and treats. So in theory health food regulations could be that terrible in certain countries but its highly unlikely. But as for dog treats go in the US that wouldn't fly, The FDA has a section on their website explaining what is and isnt allowed in dog food. ""FDA ensures that the ingredients used in pet food are safe and have an appropriate function in the pet food. Many ingredients such as meat, poultry and grains are considered safe and do not require pre-market approval. Other substances such as sources of minerals, vitamins or other nutrients, flavorings, preservatives, or processing aids may be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for an intended use (21 CFR 582 and 584) or must have approval as food additives (21 CFR 570, 571 and 573). Colorings must have approvals for that use as specified in 21 CFR 70 and be listed in Parts 73, 74, or 81.""   While this is for dog food similar rules apply for pet treats, for example jerky treats are tested pretty rigorously as they are tested for: [  Salmonella  Metals or Elements (such as arsenic, cadmium and lead, etc.)  Markers of irradiation level (such as acyclobutanones).  Pesticides  Antibiotics (including both approved and unapproved sulfanomides  and tetracyclines)  Antivirals (including amantadine, rimantadine, oseltamivir and others)  Mold and mycotoxins (toxins from mold)  Rodenticides  Nephrotoxins (such as aristolochic acid, maleic acid, paraquat, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, toxic hydrocarbons, melamine, and related triazines)  Other chemicals and poisonous compounds (such as endotoxins).  Source  So basically what I am getting at is....

From a theoretical perspective, repelling pests with ultrasound would be highly useful because it would have very little potential to interfere with electromagnetic appliances, would not require large quantities of potentially hazardous chemicals and would be unlikely to cause discomfort for people. In practice, however, most studies are inconclusive or generally negative. Studies working with Cockroaches and Mosquitoes found no effect, or, interestingly, an increase in mosquito bites. Ants don't seem to be affected. There are some old studies (40s - 70s) looking into spiders and various insects, rodents and even goose, but they generally find no effect either. The consensus view is that once they realize that the sound is not harmful they adapt to it.   However, there are some promising results, such as those by Aflitto and Hofstetter, which show that bark beetles were deterred from entering pine logs using ultrasound. It is unclear, whether this would work in real world settings and I would consider it unlikely.  So, TL;DR:  In theory: there is potential.  In practice: currently bullshit."

Animals with incomplete or simple brains may not register pain strictly speaking, but it is a scientific point of contention.  See my primary reply to the OP for more information.

Since it's a very difficult subject to study and the research is plagued by anthropocentrism, it's difficult to draw any wider conclusions. For me, it's better to take a strictly mechanical stance towards pain (i.e. do the nociceptors trigger a mechanical response that is consistent with physical pain, not some anthropocentric idea of mental suffering) than sticking to the Descartian idea that animals are automatons. In both fish (at least bony fish) and many shellfish, such a mechanical response is seen and therefore it's reasonable to assume that they feel pain at least in a physical sense.   So it boils down to a different perception of what qualifies as pain."

He also doesn't define ""suffer"" so, I guess, whatever he considers suffering counts here? This guy gets to decide when anyone is feeling pain or not based on his personal, arbitrary definition? This is also not a scientifically supported idea. There's no requirement of suffering for neurons to register pain.  3) again, what does this guy mean by ""consciousness?"" No specific definition is provided, so according to the dictionary definition, all animals are conscious as long as they are awake and/or aware of their actions so that doesn't make any sense. If he means sentience, he's still wrong because most animals are proven sentient (and if they aren't it is, at least, scientifically disputed).  4) P.S., there's also no proven link between even sentience and pain, so he's still wrong, even if you're being generous to him."

From what I can tell, most of the references to charges and dust indicate a preference for dusting being positively charged, but it seems like it can go either way. The strategy is to use charged ions that bind with dust to make them neutrally charged. However, this is only part of the solution. The reason dust clings to things (such as records and film, where you will find most of these strategies) is because of its static charge. Neutralizing the charge doesn't eliminate the dust, it just makes it not as clingy so you can use other, more mechanical methods (brushing, blowing air) to then get rid of it.  Firing a stream of ions to do this isn't too bizarre either, as there are static guns which do exactly this. You point the gun at a surface, pull the trigger, a stream of ions is released, and then you can more easily clean off the surface. Furthermore, it appears that the gun uses crystals to generate this stream of ions!  Now, that said, I'm still inclined to believe this is bullshit. There is no evidence that the crystals in Himalayan salt lamps are the types of crystals that could effectively generate charged ions in this manner. It looks like Himilayan salt is just that: salt with some impurities (such as iron oxide which lends to their color).  Furthermore, static guns work by pointing at a solid surface. I doubt aiming it in the air is going to do anything. Even if it did, it's not going to magically make the dust go away, just make it so it doesn't stick to anything."

I wanted to chime in just to say that I really do believe in the curriculum - it is a proven path and our students get jobs.  Yes, 12 weeks seems fast, and many people react thinking that some of the current job perks of being a coder today are too good to be true (high entry level salaries, working from home, etc.) - but I assure you that it isn't easy. The course is very challenging and covers a massive amount of content because being a web developer today means juggling many different languages and tools, simultaneously. Also, 9-12 weeks is sort of the average web developer bootcamp length (just google 'web developer bootcamp' if you don't know what I'm talking about).  I was able to learn on my own but it was incredibly hard and I wanted to take my experiences and package them into a highly concentrated training program, so that it could be a bit easier for anyone else who is interested. That is what Coder Manual is and that is why thousands of students are taking this course and absolutely loving it.  Having your doubts is completely understandable - feel free to sign up and I will give you 100% of your money back if you don't absolutely love the content. No questions asked. Additionally, you can email me at rob(at)codermanual(dot)com and I'll answer any questions you have and point you to our nearly 100% 5-star reviews from a course reviews website so that you can get others' opinions who have taken the course.

When someone is making a proof about the nature of a number it's going to look like this, not like the link you posted.  When someone has brain damage and is a rambling fool they will post things that look like the link you provided.  Notice how the real proof is all math, starting from ""simple"" (in some sense) assumptions and building up from there, while the false proof is all words talking about how impressive it is that pi isn't what we think it is.  The false proof makes some attempt at performing a real proof about halfway down the page where it goes into a geometric proof, but this proof doesn't actually go anywhere—never is a value for the circumference arrived at; the best it does is to build up to the claimed value with straight lines.   As it happens, the link I posted is a proof that e and pi are transcendental, which is a step above ""irrational.""  Transcendental numbers are never the root of a polynomial of finite order with rational coefficients.  Stated another way, transcendental numbers cannot be represented with a finite number of integers and the use of +, -, *, /, and exponentiation.  This proves that pi cannot be 1/sqrt(phi) as the author of that site claims, since that would make pi = 4/((1+51/2)/2)1/2 which is not a transcendental number.  You can also use any of countless formulas to arrive at what the actual value of pi is and they will all tell you it's 3.14159..., not 3.144....  The guy is nuts."

Even if you don't actually deal with the precise value of pi very much in mathematics, the fact that it is this value and that so many things include it is what makes it special enough to have its own letter associated with it that is understood without clarification or context (something which I can only think of one other instance of- the natural base, e).

In California in the ’80's, the government sold the populace on the idea of a state lottery by promising that all the income from the lottery would go exclusively to the public school system. The motto for the lotto (heh) was ""Our Schools Win Too!"". But as soon as the California state lottery was approved by voters and lottery money started flowing into the public school system, the state legislature slashed the amount of general budget money going into the school system by the same amount. So the schools didn't really win, the state government's income won (on the backs of poor people who'd been underserved by the public schools' math teaching).

'Road repairs' is a very vague category, but obviously includes many different things across the entire developed world. But in pretty much every developed country, motorway infrastructure is subsidised by general expenditures from general funding paid for through general taxation. You can work up some broad generalities about it, to estimate proportions across broad categories of taxpayers, but you can't peg any given taxpayer to any given expenditure of this type.  The purchase of a bicycle goes towards road maintenance the same as the cyclist's purchases of many other things, just like other citizens. A driver may have paid more in car taxes, but they didn't pay more in tax on toilet paper and toothpaste. A given driver might be rich and pay a lot in income tax, and it's reasonable to believe that drivers in general make more money than cyclists in general, but plenty of drivers are broke as a joke and dirt poor, and plenty of cyclists clearly have money to blow, so that's an extremely weak line to argue.  So yes, most cyclists contribute towards road repair. How much would be difficult to estimate, and largely pointless to debate. The reason is that the bulk of road repair funding comes from state and federal sources, which makes it impossible to figure out who's paying how much for what."

IsItBullshit,3a7dfp,BuddhaRocks,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:04:32 2015 UTC,"It's partial bullshit in the US. In most states in the US, gas taxes, and depending in the state, registration fees are dedicated to road repairs and construction. U/spiffiness is right though, in that those funds simply replace general revenues that would have otherwise been spent on roads (but generally they cannot be directly used for other purposes, so they are only partially fungible.)  But, those revenues are generally nowhere near enough to pay for all the road repairs and construction that go on. General tax revenues are also used, so it's not at all accurate to imply that the roads are 100% paid by the people that drive on them. For that matter, most major roads are at least partially federally funded, and that clearly involves general tax revenues (although there are federal gas taxes too.)  But even if what they were saying was true, it's irrelevant. I like to ride my bike, but I also own three cars and pay a hell of a lot of taxes on them. Does that mean I get to bike on the road, but some guy with only a bike does not get to use it? Because one of my cars is an SUV, uses a lot of gas, and hence causes me to pay a lot more in taxes than say a Leaf driver, does that mean I get to use the road ""more"" than they do? What about pedestrians?  It's a stupid, inane and logically indefensible argument."
IsItBullshit,3a7dfp,ninerdawg,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:56:52 2015 UTC,"In addition to the other well reasoned points people have posted it's worth pointing out that the damage done to roads is not equal for all vehicles.  Naturally you'd expect a semi to cause more wear than a car which causes more wear than a bike.  What isn't immediately obvious is the margin by which heavier vehicles do more damage.  I forget the exact value, but I want to say that damage to roads is roughly proportional to weight3.  Naturally there are lots of variables—having more, bigger tires will offset some of the damage—but the general trend remains:  as a vehicle gets heavier it causes significantly more wear than a lighter vehicle.  When you look at a car vs a bike, then, you're looking at maybe a 15-fold difference in weight (I used 250 pounds vs 3,750).  Using the cubic relationship that's a 3,375-fold difference in damage to the roadway.  In other words, bikes are causing essentially no wear and tear.  A garbage truck (~64,000 pounds) is doing over 16 million times the damage of a bike, so one day of trash pickup is causing more wear and tear to the roads than every bike that will ever ride on it, to say nothing of the wear caused by weather.   Of course you can always make different arguments about how the costs of a road should be distributed—in some sense a cyclist using the road has an opportunity cost in the sense that they are preventing others from using that section of road at that instant—but at that point you can just fall back to all of the other excellent points in this thread.  Ultimately people should see the complaint that cyclists ""don't pay for the roads"" for what it really is:  an excuse to hate cyclists that is more socially acceptable than whatever reason that person would otherwise use."

He mentioned the fact that professors wrote text files and uploaded them to the BBS for students to download and read, and he said in that case it wasn't needed to go to the library to look up information. The newspaper took what he said out of context and shorted it to say ""Going to the library is no longer needed."" and the library got mad at him and us.

See also wikipedia/Intoxicative inhalant and Intoxicative inhalant#Solvent glue.   Even though solvent glue is normally a legal product, there is a case where a court has ruled that supplying glue to children is illegal. [..] it was decided that it was an offence at common law to supply glue sniffing materials that were otherwise legal in the knowledge that they would be used for self-harm. Two shopkeepers in Glasgow were arrested and charged with supplying to children ‘glue-sniffing kits’ consisting of a quantity of petroleum-based glue in a plastic bag. They argued there was nothing illegal about the items that they had supplied. On appeal, the High Court took the view that, even though glue and plastic bags might be perfectly legal, everyday items, the two shopkeepers knew perfectly well that the children were going to use the articles as inhalants and the charge on the indictment should stand. When the case came to trial at Glasgow High Court the two were sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.  38/50 states have enacted laws making various inhalants unavailable to those under the age of 18. Other states prohibit the sale of these items to anyone without recognition of purpose for purchase. Some states mandate laws against using these products for purposes of getting high, while some states have laws about possessing certain inhalants. Nearly every state imposes fines and jail terms for violation of their specific laws."""

IsItBullshit,39we0d,ryaniskira,0,Wed Jul 1 02:37:16 2015 UTC,"Although it is true that women are slut shamed more than men, men are not free from shaming.  (womanizing is the olden term).    Men are often envious of male sluts (""studs"") but rarely make negative comments about their behavior (though they may harbor negativity toward it).  It's just not how men deal with one another....and youthful fantasies aside, most all men really don't want to be a stud/slut...we want a life partner.  Men also tend not to be interested in having serious relations with a woman who is a ""slut"" (duh), but at the same time they don't go out of their way to shame them unless it's personal.  Women are the main ""slut shamers"" of women.  However women tend to see male sluts (""studs"") as desirable.  Conservative fundamentalism is where you see the real difference in attitude...shaming women who are NOT sluts for normal sexual behavior, while being less harsh to the men.  All of this can be traced back to the high cost women pay (pregnancy) when they have sex and the rights of the father to know that a child he is supporting is in fact his.  Women slut shame other women as a way to devalue their competition for the stud.    The community as a whole looks down on women fucking around because if the father is unknown, then no father will step up to help support the child causing a burden on the community as a whole.  This holds true to this day, though thanks to birth control it is less of an issue.  Interestingly, hardly anyone is actually a slut, most of us only ever have a handful of partners.   SO YOUR QUESTION:   Is it as big of an issue as people make it out to be?    Yes and no.  If you really are a slut (male or female) you nasty.  I kid a bit, but truth is you need to own it and face the fact that many folks find sluts undesirable and rightly question your character. Being slutty is often a very good sign, and expecting folks to ignore that because you have some sex positive ideology, are a nympho or have self esteem issues is nuts.  Where the problem really lies is when we equate any female sexual activity as slutty.  Very few people do this, but it does color social policy decisions (more so in the past than today).  It can also effects some women's sense of self worth and can cause sexual hang-ups, etc.  (I'm sure someone has a list somewhere.)  But it's way too easy to overstate this.  Where this ""debate"" goes off the rails is when you start claiming that slut shaming is some kind of male patriarchal mechanism to  control the sexuality of women (odd that if women are the most likely to slut shame other women and least likely to care about the number of partners a man has had). And call for all women to actually be the kind of sluts they (wrongly) think men are (hook-up culture).  Or to claim that it is some how part of a culture of rape (Slut Walks).  At that point most sane people say ""bah"" or ""meh""...and then these ""activists"" say ""See! Slut shaming! Rape apologists!"" and you see a video on reddit and wonder what the big deal is and try desperately to recall the last time you ever slut shamed someone: (Hint: it was that girl who fucked the entire football team in high school)."
IsItBullshit,39we0d,1TrueScotsman,-1,Mon Jun 15 11:21:33 2015 UTC,"It is a big issue.  Modern days they have other terms for slut, like ratchet, hoe, skank, and a few others.  It is mostly women who slut shame, I don't think men care if a woman is a slut or not unless they are in a relationship with them and they cheat on him.  Male sluts are called studs or players. Players are men who are only after sex with women and try to get as many women to have sex with them as they can. Sometimes women are players as well.  I think why women sluts are shamed is because women can get pregnant, and if they have sex out of marriage they have bastard children when they get pregnant.

Men were instinctively meant to reproduce as much as possible with as many women as possible. Women on the other hand were supposed to only reproduce with the best mate that they could find to produce the strongest child.  Slut shaming stems from this because women who reproduce with lots of men were seen as poor judges of mates and were therefore looked down upon.

You can have thousands of voodoo priests beating people with ""systema spetsnaz"" kai master energy, but if one fails to do it, then obviously something about the situation is fishy.  7+ billion people live on the planet. Weird things happen rarely, but rare in a group of 7+ Billion can involve many, many people. A large sample group increases the probability of certain events. For example, if a tsunami only involved one person, it would only be able to kill one person. However, if it involved, say, the population of Germany, then many more people would be likely to die."

On average, the two dice are about .0015 apart in their averages; but the average difference between any two rolls on the same dice is about 1.95.

In a bio anthro class I took, we were told that race is not a biologically useful concept.   The genetic differences within a race are greater than those between races.  Race is also a continuum of certain traits that don't have distinct borders.   That being said, to claim that race is purely a social  construct is a bit misleading.  It's obviously based on observable traits that groups of people share.  There are very obvious biological differences between white and black people: skin color, hair, facial features, etc.    That part isn't constructed. Where we draw the lines is."

There are many different, equally valid procedures for defining races, and those different procedures yield very different classifications. One such procedure would group Italians and Greeks with most African blacks. It would classify Xhosas--the South African ""black"" group to which President Nelson Mandela belongs--with Swedes rather than Nigerians.  Another equally valid procedure would place Swedes with Fulani (a Nigerian ""black"" group) and not with Italians, who would again be grouped with most other African blacks. Still another procedure would keep Swedes and Italians separate from all African blacks but would throw the Swedes and Italians into the same race as New Guineans and American Indians.

Also, you end up getting immune to the bacteria eventually no matter what food you eat.  Pathogenic bacteria and viruses, being adapted specifically to thrive inside of human hosts, will generally infect everyone regardless.  Microbes like salmonella, e-coli, and other nasties also tend to cause far worse symptoms than just diarrhea and can even be life threatening.

The question was ""do all Italian surnames end with a vowel"" I responded in the negative since I could think of a few names ending in non-vowels right off the top of my head, only to have two people tell me those don't count.   If your only reason for them not counting those examples as traditional is the fact that they don't end in vowel sounds, then I guess I can't argue with that, but that if so, why ask the question in the first place?   I'm sorry, but the answer to ""do all Italian surnames end with vowel sounds"" is simply that most do, but some don't. Italy has had presidents and prime ministers whose names do not end in vowel sounds, there's dozens of footballers (the most ready lists of italian names I can find are football teams, oddly enough). There's plenty of examples out there. If you're disqualifying all those Italians with names because they don't fit whatever definition of 'traditionally' Italian names you're using, then I guess you win?   So, yeah, I guess if you ignore the many Italian family names ending in non-vowels, then all Italian family names end in vowels."

I understand where you guys are coming from, but that's not all of Italy.  Italian is a complicated language, there's tons of dialects, which results in different last names. Tuscan (the 'official' Italian language) is not the only dialect of Italian in use today, and it certainly is not the only form of historical Italian that was used to form last names. So yeah, there are A LOT of Italian surnames that end with vowels, because south Italian and Tuscan names do for the most part. But names from Piedmonte, Liguria, Trentino, Aosta, Lombardia, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna have surnames that do not conform to these rules.   Now, those regions are all Northern Italian, historically the richer, more industrial part of the country which had less poverty and thus had fewer emigrants to the USA. So you'll probably find fewer of the northern Italian names in the US. That does not mean they don't exist, however."

So, this is actually pretty cool. You know Death Cap mushrooms? As the name suggests, if you eat them you're fuuucked: they contain a toxin that destroys your liver. Lots of people die this way every year, because the Death Cap looks just like the benign-n-tasty button mushroom. Half a mushroom is enough to kill you, and the poison works quickly. So yeah: bad news. Even worse? For a long time, pretty much the only treatment for Death Cap poisoning was a liver transplant.  But get this. It turns out there is another treatment: yup, milk thistle. It's been said to be a folk remedy for ages— people would grind up the seeds and eat them, with meh results— but in 2007, a researcher in the Bay Area experimentally administered extract of milk thistle intravenously and saved an entire family. Every patient recovered liver function. In 2009, he did it again (we have a lot of mushrooms, and therefore a lot of poisonings). It was kind of a big deal; he was contacted by the NIH, and a long-term clinical trial is currently under way. (See: Intravenous Silibinin for Amatoxin Induced Hepatic Failure.) Some day soon, milk thistle might be the standard treatment for amanita poisoning.   So while the pills/powders at the health food store are probably worthless (and unneeded in the first place), the idea of milk thistle ""detoxifying your liver"" note: that is not how it actually works is… not entirely bullshit!

IsItBullshit,390dyr,dds39,6,Mon Jun 8 09:35:42 2015 UTC,"IMO, it is bullshit.  I'll come right out and say I like Yelp. It has done me very well. I travel a lot for work to different places and don't always know someone there that can help me out, and almost never know someone who lives right near where I am staying. I've had great success using the app to find what I am looking for. It's a great tool for narrowing down your search results to what you are looking for, where you are looking for it. Is it perfect? Certainly not. But I've yet to find anything better in situations where I need to find something to eat nearby, in a place I don't know, and don't simply want to roll the dice. When I found out about these claims that they were acting immorally, I was not happy because I really liked the app. So I did my own research.  First and foremost, manipulating reviews in or to extort people is as old as reviews themselves. However, falsely claiming impropriety on behalf of reviewers is just as old. Considering all of the people making these claims have a perfectly clear conflict of interest when it comes to Yelp, that right there should bring any claim they make under very strong scrutiny.  Second, despite the numerous claims of review manipulation when it comes to Yelp, not a single person has ever provided me anything that could even remotely be considered hard evidence of this claim. I've heard plenty of people make the claim that Yelp has offered, over the phone, to remove bad reviews or threatened to remove good reviews if they didn't pay this or that fee. Yet, not a single recording of this exists. I'm not expecting everyone to have it, but if they are doing this wide spread, it is an absolute miracle that not a single person has ever recorded anything. The more claims come out, without any type of proof, the less likely I believe them.  The only hard evidence I've seen about this is a study out of Harvard (about fake reviews), where they did a statistical analysis to see if the reviews of advertisers were filtered any differently than the reviews of non advertisers, because if they are going to use Yelp in their data, they have to be reasonably confident that Yelp wasn't doing anything shady. They found no statistical difference between the two groups. They admit (and I am bringing it to your attention) that this isn't completely exhaustive, but it is by far the best evidence I have seen and it strongly supports Yelp's claim that they aren't doing anything.  Why are there so many complaints? I am sure it is for a multitude of reasons. Originally Yelp used to allow you to promote a review when you paid them. It was clearly marked as promoted, but I bet that many people thought that this was extortion, so Yelp stopped the practice. I am sure the salespeople at Yelp can also be aggressive at times, if not all the times, and I can see these high pressure tactics making people believe they are being extorted. I am sure some people are lying about it, because they've gotten bad reviews and want to discredit yelp. I am sure others have gotten bad reviews and are ""misremembering"" what happened and turning it in their head into some kind of extortion by Yelp.  But, for me, until I see some form of actual proof, I'm not going to believe any of these claims."

There was a high school event that advertised on Facebook about the pool party, but one had to be a member of the club that owns the pool or buy a pass to get inside the fence.   There was a security guard involved when the black teenagers tried to climb the fence to get into the pool. A woman started to yell racist things. Some of the teenagers trying to get over the fence were white as well. Some women got into a fight outside the pool, and the teenagers got involved with the fight.  I think it is a mostly white neighborhood and the teenagers came from a different neighborhood because they thought the pool was free. The Police got called because there was a fight going on.   The black teenager girl in the bikini was slammed to the ground I think the officer hurt her back. The officer later on resigned but had been on the force for 10 years and won an award prior to this incident.  But the teenagers weren't arrested because they were in a white neighborhood. They were arrested because they were fighting over access to the pool. The police over-reacted a bit and got caught on camera but they didn't show the whole video where the teenagers were fighting and trying to climb the fence when the security guard was trying to stop them.   A similar incident happened at a Rap Concert recently. http://www.gopusa.com/news/2015/06/08/nj-hip-hop-concert-turns-into-riot/  Black teenagers tried to get into a rap concert without a ticket. It was sold out and there were people there with a ticket who couldn't get in because a large crowd had gather of people without a ticket that wanted to get inside.  It is not a black thing, it is more of a youth culture thing. There were some white teenagers there with the black teenagers, but the news media only focuses on the black teenagers.

IsItBullshit,38lw1a,GuiltySparklez0343,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:16:47 2015 UTC,"This particular article is straight bullshit. The idea of finding THC in space though is not entirely implausible.

IsItBullshit,38lw1a,Azrael11000,4,Fri Jun 5 14:43:25 2015 UTC,"Ethanol is 2 carbon atoms, 6 hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. THC is 21 carbon atoms, 30 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms, arranged in a much more complex molecular structure.   Because there is so little heat  in space, it is extremely rare for complex molecules to form - there's not enough available energy to sustain most chemical reactions. Most of the matter in space is in elemental form, or very simple molecules like water. Even the presence of large amounts of alcohol was baffling to scientists at first, and there are various theories involving concepts I can't really even pretend to understand like quantum tunneling to explain how it might form at such extremely low temperatures. Bigger molecules are exponentially less likely to be able to form naturally in space. Finding alcohol in space was quite a surprise. Finding something as complex as THC would be absolutely mind-blowing.  Oh, and FWIW, there's a lot more methanol than ethanol in the main booze cloud we've discovered to date - just in case anyone had any bright ideas about drinking a nebula. It's nice and chilled, though!"

IsItBullshit,38eyn7,mymanonaplane,11,Wed Jun 3 20:29:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know, it's been relatively easy for me. 21 years old, 2.5 years of paid experience, one year of unrelated college and I've had one project that paid $40 an hour. My normal rate is not that high but it is always increasing.   I live in Missouri, not really known for its cutting edge technology and it's not that hard to find work. Yes, there are slow periods where I may only have 10 hours of work in a week, but there are also times when you have 60+ a week. I've worked on some cool stuff about art, beer, boats, farming, all things I wouldn't really consider myself super interested in have turned out to be pretty interesting.   Working from home in pajamas, not stuck with a crappy computer because I can't afford a better one, make my own hours, meeting cool people, have traveled to LA, Denver, Chicago, and St. Louis.   I would definitely recommend it if you can handle the responsibility of working on your own, handling your own taxes (quarterly estimated), are dedicated enough to keep learning and working alongside your paid work, and have the patience to spend your own time learning write code until you get a job.   My first programming job came after ~5 months of JavaScript and html, and then another 2 months of Objective-C. My first project was 6 months long, 15 hours a week, and $15 an hour. I've had a lot of help and this was a little more accessible to me than others probably, but if you are able to start and want to start, then it's definitely something. I still don't really know what i'm going to do with my life but it's started out pretty well so far"
IsItBullshit,38eyn7,zRobertez,3,Wed Jun 3 21:04:21 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. So you work from home? How exactly did you get involved in projects? Are you a freelancer? I'd really like to get more information, if you don't mind."
IsItBullshit,38eyn7,Hell_Libertine,3,Thu Jun 4 00:10:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have done at least 80% of my work through a company in StL. Most other work has been through people I have met through that. They only have a small handful of employees and are proud that everyone is freelance and can work remotely if they choose to. Now I would love to be closer to the city but I'm not for the moment for other reasons.  So really, almost everything so far has just fallen into place and I've just gone with the flow for most of it. I got started when a guy my dad has known for awhile interviewed me (I had to build a crappy 30 minutes Rock Paper Scissors app for him) and decided to give me a little work along with him and I worked with him on a few of his projects for almost two years (again most of that was this same company). Slowly, we got pulled into separate things  and I was still billing through him but the work was still for this company. Then the company offered me to bill straight through them and that is where I've been for about 6 months. Pretty much every single person I've met is nice, funny, and interesting and everyone is capable of being friends. There are tough times and it is hard work every now and then but it is most definitely worth it.   Also, I hear now and then people disagreeing that this is a very good field (and my personal story might just be that. Personal.) and that things are going downhill but think about it, the Internet is everywhere, smart phones are everywhere, everyone has so many ideas and some of them have a lot of money. Even if it's going downhill, it's still in high demand. If you learn a little bit and keep your LinkedIn updated, sooner or later, you'll start to get more messages than you care for from recruiters and people looking to pay you."

IsItBullshit,38eyn7,CampAsAChamp,5,Thu Jun 4 14:27:53 2015 UTC,"I can give some perspective to balance things out, as both of my parents are in the computer science industry: the industry moves fast.  You can get a great job with high pay right out of college, then five years later they give that job to another fresh graduate who isn't going to ask for as much money as you (since they're a recent grad  looking to kick a Ramen habit but maybe you're looking to start a family). You either move up or you get laid off.  With how fast CS moves you need to be on top of the latest trendy languages. My dad is an excellent C and C++ programmer but lost a job when the company moved to Java and he didn't adapt. The recent grads know the latest trendy languages or programming styles. OOP was huge several years ago but these days its completely standard. There'll likely be another similar revolution in the future that leaves another generation of outdated programmers. When this happens you either have to relearn your craft, go to a job where the older programming style is still used (there are a lot of legacy systems to support), or go into something like project management (which is the path my mom went once the state of the art outpaced how quickly she could keep up while raising kids).  If you haven't, I recommend watching the movie Office Space with the knowledge that they're making jokes that are only funny because of how believable the situations are.  I don't mean to completely discourage you from pursuing CS, though. I think it's a great field. However, be aware that the rewards from CS are more heavily weighted to the start of a person's career. With Reddit having a strong demographic of 20-something year-olds you've got a lot of voices that are seeing their careers leap ahead of their peers', even though things may get tougher to keep up with down the road."

If you're asking this because you're considering majoring in CS, here's something to keep in mind: having a degree in almost ANY field will get you in the door to a job that pays well enough to survive. And there are many paths to happiness / a great job / a big paycheck.

IsItBullshit,37utgy,SunDragon1947,2,Sun Jun 7 09:31:17 2015 UTC,"Glass is not a liquid.  On one hand, you have the solid vs liquid property. In physics this only describes whether the molecules or atoms in a material can move easily or not, and is defined using its viscosity. If something has a viscosity higher than 1013 Poise it's a solid. Hence, window glass at room temperature (including that of churches) is solid by definition.  Regarding the fact that in some churches glass pieces are thicker in the bottom, the viscosity of glass is too high to have a measurable increase in this respect. It's because they were mounted like that: if you have glass pieces with uneven thickness, it would be quite silly to put the heavier part on top.  :)  On the other hand, a problem here is what you mean by ""glass"". In physics ""glass"" it's a more general concept than in common language, intimately related to the struggle between order and disorder.  At high temperature, the atoms or molecules have a lot of energy that can easily overcome any interaction with the neighbours, hence, they are always disordered, constantly fluctuating from one arrangement to the other. When you decrease the temperature, elements don't have so much energy and become highly influenced by the interactions with their neighbours, so they tend to order because that requires less energy (such completely ordered systems are called crystals). However, if you cool down fast enough, you can ""trap"" them in a disordered state: they would ""prefer"" to be ordered, but they don't have enough room to rearrange.  If the property that you trap it's the position of the atoms or molecules, then you have a structural glass (such as window glasses or plastics), but other fluctuating disorders can also get frozen (their orientation, shapes, magnetic spin, etc.) and then you have different kinds of glasses.  A simple analogy: imagine a group of bicycles randomly arranged in a metro carriage that suddenly gets completely filled with people. An ordered arrangement of the bicycles would allow everyone to have more space and thus be more comfortable, but it is not possible to move the bikes at this point because there's already too many people. However, if the carriage gets filled gradually, the bikes can be rearanged as needed and when the carriage eventually became completely full, the bikes would be already ordered."

The only thing with ""crystal"" in its name that could become a glass is a ""plastic crystal"". They resemble crystals in that their molecules are arranged in a regular lattice, but in this case the molecules can rotate more or less freely, while in crystals the orientation of the molecules if fixed and highly ordered. This disordered rotation can be frozen to obtain an orientational glass (an arrangement of molecules in a regular lattice but with their orientations stuck in a disordered pattern).

IsItBullshit,37ntrk,FallenXxRaven,11,Fri May 29 00:28:34 2015 UTC,"I assume you are referencing this Cracked article, which only has one source, and that source is now a dead link. This seems to me to be, at best, wild speculation, and, at worst, blatantly false. I can't find many good sources, but this list claims that the earliest known use of the idiom is in Reynard the Fox, a German book published in 1180 by Heinrich der Glîchezære:   Kin-blood is not spoilt by water.   This article seems to draw its information from the Wikipedia article, which adds that authors Albert Jack and R. Richard Pustelniak propose that it originally must have been the other way around, for no discernible reason. It also has an interesting quote from H.C. Trumbull on the Arab interpretation of the quote:   We, in the West, are accustomed to say that ""blood is thicker than water"" ; but the Arabs have the idea that blood is thicker than milk, than a mother's milk. With them, any two children nourished at the same breast are called "" milk-brothers,"" or ""sucking brothers""; and the tie between such is very strong. [..] But the Arabs hold that brothers in the covenant of blood are closer than brothers at a common breast; that those who have tasted each other's blood are in a surer covenant than those who have tasted the same milk together ; that ""blood-lickers,"" as the blood-brothers are sometimes called, are more truly one than ""milk-brothers,"" or ""sucking brothers""; that, indeed, blood is thicker than milk, as well as thicker than water.   I speculate that the modern usage of the idiom matches its original intention, which, to the best of our knowledge, is presented in Reynard the Fox.    I would also argue that the original intention doesn't matter, and that idioms, like all other facets of language, are going to naturally change with time, and that sternly sticking with what you believe is the ""original"" meaning is more misuse than adopting with the times, but I'll leave that for you to decide."

I think at least part of the answer is because even though they are getting nailed with a one-shot KO, they have trained to the point of instinctual response (as opposed to conscious) and they are already moving to absorb the blow when it lands.

The OP posited a 'sneak attack' type scenario, which is substantially different from a situation where someone knows they are about to be hit and can dodge, block, absorb.  Most KO's are the result of cumulative impact shock combined with sustained trauma and exhaustion. A lot of the KO isn't actually from any single blow.

IsItBullshit,36vwkn,AreaManatee,5,Mon May 25 04:30:15 2015 UTC,"First sentence of the article:    When YOU release a toy gyroscope on its pedestal, it initially has NO precessional rotation around that pedestal. A moment later, it is merrily precessing around the pedestal! Both Kinetic Energy and Angular Momentum now exist where they did not exist a moment earlier.   By no means am I an expert in physics or gyroscopes, but I'll have a go. Before a gyroscope is released, the internal wheel must first be spun either by fingers, or better yet, a wrapped string that is pulled to initiate the spin. It is then set on a pedestal, where it will precess, like the author describes. Without getting into the complexities of the physics (because I'm too lazy to read up on it, but also mostly because I'm not terribly smart), the angular momentum of the precessing gyroscope comes from the angular momentum of the internal wheel. The motion of the internal wheel causes a constant torque force due to its spinning motion, but won't result in precession until you put in on the pedestal.    In other words, the force causing the angular momentum is already there. It just doesn't cause any angular momentum when you are holding it still, because well, you are holding it. When you put the gyroscope on the pedestal then the force is translated into motion/angular momentum.    As a side note, regarding this bit talking about kinetic and potential energy:    We will discuss below that the Kinetic Energy is easy to explain, as appearing due to the body of the gyroscope dropping a tiny fraction of a millimeter in the Earth's gravitational field, giving up exactly the correct amount of Potential Energy.     I don't think that tiny amount of potential energy from the gyroscope dropping a few millimeters max has any appreciable influence on the resulting motion of the gyroscope. The author doesn't seem to know what he is talking about.    But then again, I'm not an expert either. So pick your poison, I suppose."
IsItBullshit,36vwkn,Sirloinchops,3,Fri May 22 19:54:30 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty good explanation, just to clarify, it precesses because of the torque exerted by gravity. An analogy is, you put a ball at the top of a ramp. It's not moving exactly when you let it go. As soon as you let it go out starts rolling down the ramp. Is it magic? Obviously not, gravity caused it to roll."

On the other hand, dogs are more likely to start on a corpse than cats, cats are generally more interested in small animals like mice (which they still don't eat as far as I know).  I mean, if someone finds a study to prove either of the two that'd be cool, but a study directed at this question would be impossible without prisoners of war forced to do whatever their captor demands . All we have evidence of now is that dogs are more likely to eat humans but also more likely to show compassion. I haven't read any proof of cats eating their owners and I know I've read at least 3 or 4 of dog owners (multiple big dogs) who ended up being devoured by their pets after death.  So it seems like the specific question is bullshit, there's no reason a dog wouldn't eat his owner but a cat would.

The trend I've noticed is the more times I pick a scab, the more of a distinct scar it'll leave (I'm black, and the skin under a scab is much paler).  However, these scars do go away after a few months anyway; they're not, like, permanent injury scars.  Untouched scabs almost always fall off with a flawless recovery for me.  I don't really know why it works like that, though, and different people's bodies might behave differently.  As for scabs reforming, though, they always reform.  Sometimes they have different consistencies.  If I pick a scab like a day before it was gonna come off anyway, it might not bleed.

Now, it is likely that this will continue at the same rates (another 14% increase in CO2 is probably going to give less than a 11% increase in plant growth), but there is a positive correlation between atmospheric CO2 and plant growth.  So this is probably accurate: increased CO2 will tend to increase plant growth, all other things being equal. But what many people are afraid of is that that is dependent on all things staying equal: they won't. We are already seeing changing weather patterns, which will mean that some areas of the Earth will be less fertile, because there will be less rainfall."

It is not a scam as much as any loan is not a scam.  You own your home, or have paid off most of it, and you sign it over to the bank and they give you money each month (it's a loan), but you do not have to pay off the loan until you die (or move or otherwise not live there anymore) and you can stay in your house for the rest of your life.  When you die, the bank asks for the money back. Your heirs can either pay back the money and keep your house, or the bank takes the house (you aren't living in it anymore so that is probably OK)."

IsItBullshit,36huz8,LukeTheFisher,5,Tue May 19 16:20:22 2015 UTC,"They sell the house which is probably now worth much more than they loaned out as home values tend to increase over time. I think there is some government subsiding involved as well that make it more attractive to the banks.  EDIT: Let's say homes tend to increase in value about 5% per year. If they loaned you $100,000 in 2020, and you died in 2050, the house would be worth about $265,000. If the loan had been at 3%, your kids would either have to give them $180,000 or they would sell the house and property for the $265,000 (minus costs) without having to go through a costly foreclosure."
IsItBullshit,36huz8,hkdharmon,2,Tue May 19 16:25:18 2015 UTC,The subsidising would make sense because I can't see why they'd otherwise take on the risk of having a house that might not even sell or sell as well as they'd hoped it might. Then again what do I know about economics.

IsItBullshit,36huz8,hkdharmon,1 point,Tue May 19 16:55:28 2015 UTC,"The bank subtracts interest from the money they give you too.  Here's an over simplification for clarity: Say you own a house worth $100,000.  I agree to pay you $9,000 every year for the next ten years.  Every time I do this, you owe me $10,000.  After ten years, if you can't pay me, I get your house.  After ten years, you owe me $100,000, so you sell your house and pay me what you owe.  I get $10,000 more than I paid you, and you have been turning the value of your house into $9,000/yr in income.  But let's say you die after 5 years.  Your estate inherits a house that is securing our deal.  So your estate owes me $50,000.  Your estate sells the house, and pays me $50,000, and keeps the remaining $50,000 dollars of equity left in the home.  I get $50,000 dollars after only having paid you $45,000.  Like I say, this is a HUGE oversimplification, but this is basically the idea behind reverse mortgages.  Like any financial transaction there are good ones and shady ones.  But that's the basic idea."

IsItBullshit,36huz8,themassiah,1 point,Tue May 19 18:16:31 2015 UTC,"A regular mortgage is like slowly buying your home. As you pay off more principle, you get more equity in the home. A reverse mortgage is like slowly selling your home. As you receive loan money and as interest accumulates on the money you have received already, you lose equity, which probably means that when you die, your estate has to sell the house to pay off the reverse mortgage.  It's confusing because it's still functionally a loan. If you pay back the payments, then you're in the same position you would have been in if you just took out a second mortgage. The defining feature of reverse mortgages is that you are allowed to defer payments until you die, move, or sell the house.  I don't think you can make a blanket statement that they're all bullshit. In theory it should be a perfectly viable way to cash in on your nest egg that you built over the course of your life while still being able to live in your house. But there are strong concerns that people who enter into them don't understand the terms, and sometimes you pay higher interest than you would for a second mortgage."

Other apps can do recognition of arbitrary objects. So they can probably do okay with single units of standard food (notice they only demo with apples, bread, etc.)  That's going to completely break down with assemblies of food... even something as simple as spaghetti with sauce and meatballs, which they do have as an example... there's a drastic range of variability between types of pasta, brands and styles of sauce, and various meats you could use. I don't believe for a second that they can tell any of those things from image recognition.  Let alone something with more obvious layers, for example a sandwich. That can vary by 300 calories or more depending how much mayonnaise you put on it, and how would they possibly tell that with the product they describe?

IsItBullshit,367lin,CRCasper,5,Sun May 17 01:51:36 2015 UTC,"I have heard of these products and while it is possible, you really need to try multiple solutions yourself.  For what it's worth I suffer from hyperhydrosis on my armpits (I could be naked in Antarctica and still be sweating up a tsunami). I first used a product called Driclor which is a roll-on, but that was insanely painful. If you're not familiar with the chemicals used in these solutions, they can sting or itch a hell of a lot after application, especially if you skin has any moisture on it before application. Driclor worked well and I only needed to apply it every week or so, but my skin became incredibly dry and began cracking.  I now use a spray called Odaban and have gotten much better results. Before bed I clean my armpits with a damp wash cloth and then use a dry towel to dry them as best I can. Then I'll sit with my arms up and when all the water has evaporated, I'll spray the stuff liberally all over my armpits. Then I'll take the dry towel and just sandwhich it in my armpit to absorb the excess and I'll do the same to the other side. In the morning I'll use a regular antiperspirant which helps keep any odour at bay. This process has left me with almost no itch or sting at all and it'll last me almost a week too which is great.  In your case, as I said I'd recommend trying different products and seeing what works best. You may notice your skin becomes more dry that it used to be and if it chaps or cracks you absolutely must stop using that product. It's also worth bearing in mind that if you stop perspiring in your hands and feet, you may start sweating in other areas such as your armpits, back, and face. I've noticed that my face and feet sweat a bit more now, but your mileage may vary.  TL;DR Probably does work but not all brands work the same and you should try around with different products."

To get these towelettes you basically just have to drench the towelettes in the same substance as in the product I use, dab the area and you´re good to go. It´s no different from me pouring my liquid onto a towellette and using that."

Salt water makes a good antiseptic because dehydrates cells, which adversely effects microbes more than it adversely effects humans; and can help to reduce inflammation. Likewise, we do need salt in our diet to regulate biological processes.  However, salt therapy takes those basic facts and runs with them as far as it can, and then keeps going; well past where any licensed medical doctor would consider testing."

However, while popular, it is not statistically sound: taking a test years, or even weeks, later can change what category you are in; and three of the four spectra that it supposedly measures are unimodal: people tend to be near the center, rather than on the two edges; meaning that the differences between a ""Feeler"" and a ""Thinker"" (T/F in the third character) may be very minor, but just happen to fall on different sides of an arbitrary line.  It's bullshit."
IsItBullshit,35q267,ZacQuicksilver,0,Tue May 12 16:17:53 2015 UTC,"People's personalities and how they answer the questions can change years or even weeks later. That's not sufficient for a ""bullshit"" proclamation.  Seems like the best thing to do would be to repeat the test over an interval and average the results - that way you eliminate the noise caused by bad days and whatnot. Humans are remarkably terrible at self evaluation."
IsItBullshit,35q267,Karunamon,10,Tue May 12 17:28:01 2015 UTC,"The main criticism isn't that people's personalities change: it's that the distributions are unimodal: that most people are right in the middle, and that an artificial line right down the middle isn't meaningful.  To compare two things we deal with in normal life, let's look at height and sex:  Sex is bimodal, so it makes sense to divide people into two categories: male and female. While there are people who are in the middle (androgynous, hermaphrodites, etc.), those people are relatively rare; and most people tend not to be ""average"", and instead closer to one of two area.  Height is unimodal: most people are of average height; and the taller or shorter you want someone, the harder you have to look. For height, it doesn't really make sense to divide people into either ""tall"" or ""short""; because no matter where you draw the line, you are either going to get people who object; or you are going to see many cases of people who are very close in height, but on opposite sides of the line, and therefore one is tall, and the other short.  The Myers-Briggs personality traits tend to show distributions more similar to height than to sex: they tend to be unimodal, with dividing line more an approximation of halfway than any meaningful divide between how people are.  Said another way, if ""Thinking/Feeling"" was judged by 100 one-to-five questions where you are rated on each one; most people would fall close to 300. If this were a real divide between humans, we would expect to see most people fall close to one of two numbers; with relatively few people near the center.  Over time, I've changed how masculine/feminine I am; as do most people I know. But I've only known a couple people who are close enough to that line between male and female that this normal variation carries them back and forth over the line. I've known a lot of people whose normal variation in personality carries them back and forth over the lines that the Myers-Briggs personality test draws. And the statistics on the results shows that this is normal.  And because the Myers-Briggs test makes no mention of that, and does not take it into account, means that the conclusions that are drawn from it are exaggerated at best; and likely to be incorrect if more than 5 weeks out of date. Averaging over time might work; but statistical analysis might show that you can not say with reasonable confidence (90% or better) that you are in any category."

Why do the parameters of the test necessarily imply an expectation of any particular result? I think some of the institutes that run these tests professionally note that some of the 16 possible unique results are more common than others (with the INTJ type being something like 2ish percent of the tested population - only remembering it because that's what I usually get).  As to the ""line"" you mention, there's actually more than one line, and that's per trait. Personal example again - I take this thing roughly once a month (there's a Facebook app for it), and every time, for the last 5 or so years, I get ""IN*J"", with the T or F changing rather often. If you were to draw a graph of the results, it would look something like this:  +-----------------------------------+ |       |      |                    | |       |      |                 |  | |       |      |                 |  | |       |      |                 |  | |     I |   N  |        T |    J |  | +-------+------+----------+------+--+ |     E     S           F      P    | |                                   | |                                   | |                                   | |                                   | +-----------------------------------+       But how is that not also a valid result? Some traits can be stronger or weaker than others, and some variations of the test account for that.  My whole point is, so far, every problem brought up can be rationally explained - it's therefore not bullshit."
IsItBullshit,35q267,Karunamon,5,Tue May 12 20:26:18 2015 UTC,"I think I've heard this before - why, though? Why do the parameters of the test necessarily imply an expectation of any particular result?   If you are going to divide people into groups, it helps to have natural groups to divide people into. Especially for ""personality tests"" that claim to explain who a person is.  Like height: if you have to divide people into ""tall"" and ""short"" people, where is that line? Especially if you are doing something that may shape employment options, dating prospects, etc.  There is one line per trait: I'm aware. But for each of the cases, the line is pretty close to where the largest number of people score, meaning that a significant majority of people have at least one score that alternates over time: like your T/F. Imagine if there was that line for height; and when I woke up (people are taller than they wake up, and shrink very slightly over the day, due to which way gravity is pulling on you) I was tall, but sometime during the day, I became short. And then the next day, I wake up and am tall again. The same way that you're either an Architect (INTJ) or an Advocate (INFJ) depending on when you take the test.  As an extreme example of the problem of grouping people into two groups based on a unimodal distribution, using a dividing line close to the mode, imagine if we divided people into ""smart"" and ""dumb"" based on their IQ; with 100 as the dividing line. Now, that's clearly an extreme example, but it highlights the problems with the statistics behind the Myers-Briggs test.  I would be far happier if each trait was divided into three categories, with a middle ground for ""mixed"", and limit placing descriptors like ""Thinker"" or ""feeler"" on people who are more than 2 standard deviations from the average.  Because you are right that the personality traits that are shown are loosely based on reality (there are suggestions that a better statistical analysis could refine the test a bit), and if you go in knowing the statistics, and look at your scores AND NOT the 4-character codes they give you, the test is significantly more useful. It still needs a lot of work (look over the list of criticism on the wikipedia page: I've focused on the one I know best and hold against it personally), but the way you are using it makes it marginally useful.  But if all you see is the 4-character score, it's complete and total bullshit."

IsItBullshit,35q267,taw,0,Wed May 13 04:07:39 2015 UTC,"Kind of. What you linked to is the simple-to-understand caricature of 25 years of Carl Jung's studies of personality traits.  The interesting thing are the eight traits behind, which are: THINKING, FEELING, INTUITION and SENSING. You may thin ""but that's only four"" well each one can either be INTROVERTED or EXTRAVERTED dominant. So now you have eight.  The test asks you a bunch of questions then ranks you using these eight traits and gives you a slightly confusing four-letter name. I am ""INTP"" which means my four dominant traits in order are: INT THINKING, EXT INTUITION, INT SENSING and EXT FEELING.  Why this is useful is that I now know - to a certain extent - what my strengths and weaknesses are. For example, I'm pretty good at introverted thinking which is related to analysis and figuring things out. On the other end, is extraverted feeling which means (basically) talking and sharing my feelings.   So now I know - very broadly - that I need to improve my extraverted feeling to become a more balanced human.  This image here - https://zombiesruineverything.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/basics3.png - is the best one for understanding how each one of the eight traits works inside the sixteen personality types detailed in your post.  The bottom line: it is bullshit if you take it too seriously and believe you can reduce us all down into these dumb stereotypes. Obviously that's ridiculous. However, I personally believe there can be HUGE benefit to breaking down ones personality into these eight (or four) key components for self improvement and understanding strengths and weaknesses."

I did sleep with a relatively high number of women, but also alienated a lot of people.  The guys I've known who actually have hot girls chasing them consistently are generally handsome, friendly, outgoing, funny, and cool. (What a radical thought, right?) One of them was into PUA, worked as a dishwasher, and partied all the time. He is super social; he's very often a ""facebook friend in common"" when I meet someone new. He was a decently handsome scruffy looking hipster/druggy black guy. (I thought maybe he was homeless when I first met him.)   I know other guys who are popular with girls and they generally all seem to be handsome, funny, outgoing, and friendly.   Money doesn't seem very important. For example, another guy I know is a 30-something accountant, wealthy, tall, average-looking white guy, and he was also into PUA, but had zero success with it. I think he came off as a cheesy trying-to-get-laid guy rather than a cool guy with a lot of friends.  I don't have an awesome sex life where every girl wants me now. However, all the social experience I gained with women and people was somewhat helpful and I learned a lot (although I might have learned it on my own over the years anyway.)   Personally, I think I would much rather have a good relationship than occasional one night stands with girls I wouldn't actually want to date, but that's something I only realize through hindsight and experience. My favorite relationship was from before I got into PUA. Well, actually, I was applying a piece of dating advice I had read: ""Just ask, because the worst she can say is no""... I asked her out for coffee and we had a great relationship for over a year afterwards.   I would not recommend PUA stuff; I think for the most part it's a big waste. However, everyone's experience is different and you might get more out of it than I did. You could also say that I didn't/don't apply the advice constistently enough, rather than that it is bad advice."

Two books have actually made my stomach turn and made me nauseous to the point of having to put it down to take a break so I don't throw up: One of them is Hitler's Mein Kampf and the other one is this one. Yell ""association fallacy"" all you want to; some things really are like that.  First off, it is not only misogynist - that goes without saying - but racist and homophobic too. In fact, it goes out of its way to say something shitty about every walk of life except the ""alpha males"" who are ""smart enough"" to see the world for the garbage can it is and piss all over it. And then ends up calling the reader a punk for reading such filth too. Literally the angriest little book you could imagine. As for the misogynist part, it really does compare to Mein Kampf because it claims that all women have a conspiracy to deny men a piece of tail, to humiliate them, subjugate them, enslave them, etc.  Second, the author goes on vast flights of bullshit: He claims to have hooked up with major headline celebrities, traveled the world, rubbed elbows with the upper crust, and fucked everything on two legs from Egyptian mummies to the Queen Mum. He simply cannot go more than a paragraph without reminding you what a big shot he is. If you'd listen to L. Ron Hubbard for your dating advice, this is the book for you.  Third, the writing style does not inspire confidence. It rips off pop culture like the amateur piece of fan-fiction it is, naming characters things like ""Tyler Durden"" and ""Mystery"" without the slightest irony. In between, the guy forces you to learn his own made-up language of smug little acronyms like ""AFC"" for ""Average Frustrated Chimp."" A few chapters in, you can hardly comprehend what's going on anymore unless you've bathed your brain in this guy's Newspeak language designed to rearrange your thinking into that of a shallow, manipulative asshole.  Finally, it is nothing but a sociopath's manual. Serial killers would benefit from a read, because it's the ultimate guide to convincing people that you have candy in your van just long enough to slip them the chloroform. And not only does it advocate this attitude, it screams in rage at anybody who thinks differently. Are you a polite, nice person who likes to treat people decently? Then you are, according to this book, a piece of shit who deserves to have your balls chopped off so you don't infect the human race with your wrong thinking.  Final summation: Hate literature."
IsItBullshit,35i9oc,SarcasticSadist,5,Mon May 11 15:45:55 2015 UTC,"Huh. Interesting. I read that book too and had a completely different interpretation.  To me, The Game is about why PUA techniques are toxic both to the individual using them and the world around him. Sure, the first half of the book contains two or three PUA ""plays"" but the book is far from the manual of manipulation that it is often made out to be. The back half of the book (SPOILER ALERT) sees Neil Straus abandon his PUA ways in order to have a real relationship with a woman he respects as an equal. In fact, the very first chapter foreshadows his eventual change- it's a scene of him checking Mystery, one of the world's foremost PUAs, into a mental institution.  Also- do you realize that Mystery and Tyler Durden are both real people, not fictional characters invented by Neil Strauss? Mystery had a TV show. Neil Strauss had a career before the game working with celebrities on their memoirs, he's an accomplished writer."

What it does is help you process very troubling memories (like sexual assault, abuse) to break off the emotional connection to them.  The therapist has patient do repetitive taps and then just focus on memories, letting one go from one to the next.  I don't fully understand the tapping, but I think it is supposed to help with distracting person from critically analyzing each memory.  The therapist then stops the patient, asks for quick image of the last one and then instructs the patient to begin again with that theme in the image.    The concept is that our memories are all tied and basically falling through the chain of them, we can get to the core memory and then work through that memory and emotions that it raises.  Hope I explained well, I'm speaking from my experience and a doctor that practices emdr can probably explain better than I did. It does take several sessions to notice improvement.  While I still remember the traumatic things, I'm able to think back on them without having a panic attack now."

However, he says it really does work."
IsItBullshit,35iy6d,drpattijane,3,Tue May 19 15:49:33 2015 UTC,"micechasekittens is right - EMDR therapy doesn't make you forget, but it does metabolize bad memories and store them properly in the brain so they're not ""stuck in your throat."" The Bilateral Stimulation (taps, lights, and/or sound) have been extensively researched: (from emdr.com) Numerous memory researchers have evaluated the eye movements used in EMDR therapy. A recent meta-analysis of the eye movement research has reported positive effects (Lee & Cuijpers, 2013) in both clinical and laboratory trials (see above). It is hypothesized that a number of mechanisms interact synergistically. ...studies have tested specific hypotheses regarding mechanism of action and found a direct effect on emotional arousal, imagery vividness, attentional flexibility, retrieval, distancing and memory association.""  I use EMDR therapy as my primary psychotherapy treatment and I've also personally had EMDR therapy for anxiety, panic, grief, and “small t” trauma. As a client, EMDR worked extremely well and also really fast. As an EMDR therapist, and in my role as a facilitator who trains other therapists in EMDR therapy (certified by the EMDR International Association and trained by the EMDR Institute, both of which I strongly recommend in an EMDR therapist) I have used EMDR therapy successfully with panic disorders, PTSD, anxiety, depression, grief, body image, phobias, distressing memories, bad dreams, and many other problems. It's a very gentle method with no significant ""down-side"" so that in the hands of a professional EMDR therapist, there should be no freak-outs or worsening of day-to-day functioning.  The research on EMDR therapy, in addition to that on trauma and PTSD, includes its efficacy with generalized anxiety disorder, treatment of distressful experiences that fail to meet the criteria for PTSD, dental phobia, depression, body dysmorphic disorder, chronic phantom limb pain, panic disorder with agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and peer verbal abuse.  One of the initial phases (Phase 2) in EMDR therapy involves preparing for memory processing or desensitization (memory processing or desensitization - phases 3-6 - is often what is referred to as ""EMDR"" which is actually an 8-phase method of psychotherapy). In this phase resources are ""front-loaded"" so that you have a ""floor"" or ""container"" to help with processing the really hard stuff, as well as creating strategies if you're triggered in everyday life. In Phase 2 you learn a lot of great coping strategies and self-soothing techniques which you can use during EMDR processing or anytime you feel the need.   In phase 2 you learn how to access a “Safe or Calm Place” which you can use at ANY TIME during EMDR processing (or on your own) if it feels scary, or too emotional, too intense. One of the key assets of EMDR therapy is that YOU, the client, are in control NOW, even though you weren’t in the past, during traumatic events and/or panic/anxiety, or whatever disturbance(s) on which you’re working. You NEVER need re-live an experience or go into great detail, ever! You NEVER need to go through the entire memory. YOU can decide to keep the lights (or the alternating sounds and/or tactile pulsars, or the waving hand, or any method of bilateral stimulation that feels okay to you) going, or stop them, whichever helps titrate – measure and adjust the balance or “dose“ of the processing. During EMDR processing there are regular “breaks” and you can control when and how many but the therapist should be stopping the bilateral stimulation every 25-50 passes of the lights to ask you to take a deep breath and say just a bit of what you’re noticing, anything different, any changes. (The stimulation should not be kept on continuously, because there are specific procedures that need to be followed to process the memory). The breaks help keep a “foot in the present” while you’re processing the past. Again, and I can’t say this enough, YOU ARE IN CHARGE so YOU can make the process tolerable. And your therapist should be experienced in the EMDR therapy techniques that help make it the gentlest and safest way to detoxify bad life experiences and build resources.  Grounding exercises are essential. You can use some of the techniques in Dr. Shapiro's new book ""Getting Past Your Past: Take Control of Your Life with Self-Help Techniques from EMDR."" Dr. Shapiro is the founder/creator of EMDR but all the proceeds from the book go to two charities: the EMDR Humanitarian Assistance Program and the EMDR Research Foundation). The book is an easy read, helps you understand what's ""pushing"" your feelings and behavior, helps you connect the dots from past experiences to current life. Also gives lots of really helpful ways that are used during EMDR therapy to calm disturbing thoughts and feelings.  Pacing and dosing are critically important. So if you ever feel that EMDR processing is too intense then it might be time to go back over all the resources that should be used both IN session and BETWEEN sessions.   Many organizations, professional associations, departments of health of many countries, the US Dept. of Defense, and the VA, all have given their ""stamp of approval"" to EMDR therapy. There are 35 randomized controlled (and 20 nonrandomized) studies that have been conducted on EMDR therapy in the treatment of trauma, and many more on other psychological and physical conditions.   The World Health Organization has published Guidelines for the management of conditions that are specifically related to stress: Trauma-focused CBT and EMDR are the only psychotherapies recommended for children, adolescents and adults with PTSD. “Like CBT with a trauma focus, EMDR aims to reduce subjective distress and strengthen adaptive cognitions related to the traumatic event. Unlike CBT with a trauma focus, EMDR does not involve (a) detailed descriptions of the event, (b) direct challenging of beliefs, (c) extended exposure, or (d) homework."" (Geneva, WHO, 2013, p.1)"

But if you ask an acupuncturist what is going on they will tell you that disease is misaligned energy flow and that the needles realign your energy (or something like that).  The language drives me nuts too, but meditation, yoga, and breathing exercises are a great way to start and end your day with a clear mind. If I am working on the computer for hours and try to go to sleep without stretching everything out first, I often do not sleep as well. Slow deep breathing does stretch your lungs out, increases lung capacity over time and makes your lungs stronger. I know that poor breathing and related problems have a big impact on sleep and sleep quality.  Further, when it comes to yoga, there are a lot of right and wrong ways to do things. In my experience, so matter how simple, you are trying to engage your entire body in any pose. IMO, that simple body awareness plays a big role in at least getting the relaxation out of the experience. Could one particular tongue placement be superior to another? I've never heard of this before, but it makes sense there could be a preferred practice.  I think the real BS is how many people want something that seems as easy as taking a drug for everything, but in particular anxiety and insomnia, when all the science says nothing is more effective than proper diet and regular exercise.

If they used a similar level of physics bullshitting on a phenomenon that you have more personal experience with then it would likely just be downright offensive. Their claims are on par with saying that cars drive forward by tilting the road and letting themselves roll downward.  The first claim that showed that this guy has no idea how electronics work is that he is proposing a ridiculous reason for electronics heating up–that the electrons get lonely or something like that. He claims that with a higher current you could get less heating which is the opposite of the truth.  He also shows ridiculous things like a pair of electrons orbiting each other, or orbiting a magnetic field line. Both of these are completely contrary to physics. Electrons repel each other, and magnetic field lines are a visualization of a continuous field. They do not exist.  He also doesn't address the point that if this device were spinning then it would be inducing a force trying to slow it down. Even if it were producing an output there would still need to be energy input.  This device would be just as well supported if he had just waved his hands and said magic when asked how it works. Perhaps better supported, even, as magic isn't a well studied effect that would produce the opposite effects of what he claims."

IsItBullshit,352phf,humpers96,5,Wed May 6 20:39:20 2015 UTC,"Fat can only be lost by being physically removed (liposuction) or metabolized - used as fuel in place of caloric intake (which can be restricted through diet control) to cover the caloric consumption of the body (which can be raised by exercise). There are many approaches to optimize this mechanism but there literally is no way around or against it.  You can lose waterweight through dehydration which might slim you down by an isignficant amount but this will be reversed quickly by normal hydration. Decreasing water weight over the long term can be achieved through restriction of dietary sodium (salt) intake, this also not very significant.  A somewhat disputed aspect of losing waterweight is the ""whoosh"" effect. Following rapid fat loss the fat cells are filled with water and thus retain their volume (no decrease in size) which is then reabsorbed over time. There is anecdotal evidence that you can trigger a ""whoosh"" effect through very intense exercise or a big meal that will lead to rapid water weight loss (over the course of a day for example) that would deplete the water stored in fat cells. I've never heard of any kind wraps doing this though and is something that would happen inevitably in a matter of days or weeks, intentionally triggered or not. This whole part might also be bullshit though and is definitely not studied scientifically as of now.  As a rule of thumb you should never take water weight into account, it's either insignificant or temporary (be it solution or problem)."

However, I can judge whether or not these claims seem realistic based on the nature of academic research. I have peer-reviewed research in the field of mathematics (specifically machine learning), so I know how the process goes. I also know what getting a PhD (and doing PhD research) entails, as that is a career path I seriously considered for years.    With that being said, this seems like complete BS for a variety of reasons.    First of all, when you pursue a PhD you don't have a ""major"", you have a ""field"". A major is a fairly broad area, like Biology or Sociology that you dive into and learn about from various perspectives. When you get a Bachelor's, you have a major. When you pursue a PhD, you pick a specific field/area in your major to focus on. For example, I majored in math, but if I had gotten a PhD, I would have done it in the field of Ranking Theory. The correct terminology would be to say ""I got a PhD in Ranking Theory"" or ""I do research in the field of Ranking Theory"", with a less common approach (usually used to describe your degree to laymen) being ""I got a PhD in math"", and never ""I got a PhD, and my major was math.""    Second, formulas aren't that long. Papers (especially a PhD thesis) can be that long, but ""formulas"" are not. There are many reasons for this, most of which involve the simple fact that mathematical notation by nature is concise. Additionally, introducing new and novel concepts, such as being able to ""measure distance without light"", are usually created by providing a completely new technique, like something people have never thought of before, not as extremely long calculations. Long ""formulas"" are usually what little kids thing complicated math is about, but it is completely the wrong idea.    On that note, a PhD thesis is usually hundreds of pages long, and includes many different components, such as a literature review, discussion of past research, and discussion of your own research (which should contain multiple publications by the time you write your thesis). In other words, your thesis isn't ""one"" paper, it's an amalgamation of several years of research that discusses said research and its foundation, including the impact your research has on the scientific community and potential further areas of extending the research. I would better describe a PhD thesis almost as being like an autobiographical textbook. Furthermore, if she had actually gotten a PhD, her thesis would have been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and (as stated) it would be hundreds of pages long, she would have a known research advisor to trace it back to, and by the very nature of academic research it would be heavily documented and easily searchable. This isn't to say it would be ""popular"" or anything like that, as most PhD theses are published, cited a couple times, and then basically forgotten about, but they are damn easy to look up.    Because of these reasons, it seems extremely likely this is all just a sham. At the very least, the person who wrote her Wikipedia page clearly does not understand the nature of a PhD or how academic research works, so that information is certainly suspect. Also, the paper you linked to is not published in a peer-reviewed journal and the abstract seems simplistic for something written by a PhD candidate. It gives off the impression of being more like a senior thesis (Bachelor's degree) rather than a PhD thesis."

You don't need to actually watch the show but rather just check into it. It will give you points for that show or movie until it is over as long as you stay checked in.  -Always do the quests and streaks. These are easy way to get good points.  -Always do the music check in! ALWAYS!!! This is the easiest way to get points honestly. The only catch is that it always needs to be a new song so you can't use the same album each day. Spotify has lots of random playlists that can help with this.   -Right now is the off season but when football comes on you can get a bunch of points for just guessing the score of the games. And kinda the same for basketball.  -If you really wanna go hard core you can use wetpaint which is owned by viggle. Some videos give you points and you can watch it 10 times per day.

However, if OP's friend is saying that Fukushima was worse because it killed more people, then that is almost certainly bullshit."

IsItBullshit,346wug,SmugglingGrapes,16,Wed Apr 29 00:54:50 2015 UTC,"Nononono. Absolute bullshit. Chernobyl was a clusterfuck because the moderator graphite caught on fire, spreading radioactive particulate matter over a large inhabited area. People were not evacuated promptly, and many were exposed to nastiness like I-131 in the hours after containment was breached. Ultimately >200 firefighters/operators/responders died of ACUTE rad effects alone. Reasonable estimates of the total additional fatal cancer cases caused (using LNT) hovers in the 50,000-250,000 range, and cleanup is nigh on impossible because of geographic distribution.  Fukushima, on the other hand, caused ZERO deaths from acute radiation injury. There was no graphite to catch on fire, and containment was breached by a H2/O2 explosion (NOT a nuclear one). Evacuation was prompt, thorough and avoided potentially catastrophic exposure. Even the worst-dosed cleanup workers have not developed ARS. LNT predicts ~300-1000 additional fatal cancers in the exposed populations (statistically undetectable). The Cs-137/Sr-90 total outputs were on par with Chernobyl (depends on the estimate, ranges from 30%-150%), but most of it was swept into the ocean (a good thing) and diluted down rapidly . A recent survey by WHOI showed that the exposure risk from water-born radionuclides was confined to an area only a few km off of the reactor shoreline. Cleanup is ongoing (expensive as fuck), but going well. Topsoil/water remediation via ion-exchange resins has been extremely successful, and most of the leaks at the plant are under control (though it's a bit like playing whack-a-mole some days). The situation is stable, and we're slowly but surely digging our way out the hole we got ourselves into."

Greenpeace and other groups routinely claim as high as 1.2M deaths, but no one takes their methodology seriously. It all depends on how you account for low doses to large populations. Using the LNT model, if you get a tiny dose (sub background, even) and apply it to a large enough group, you get big scary numbers that don't reflect reality.   Also, that documentary is by a ""new world order"" conspiracy channel, so I wouldn't exactly take their word as gospel."

IsItBullshit,346wug,feckinghound,5,Wed Apr 29 13:17:17 2015 UTC,"While there are numerous subjective ways to define 'worse,' the generally accepted objective method for comparing nuclear accidents is by INES level (0-7, 7 being the highest).  On that scale, only two accidents in history score a 7 -- Chernobyl and Fukushima. Stopping there, they may seem about equal.  But there's a huge difference in the human toll. In the official record, ""at least two"" persons' deaths can be attributed to the accident at Fukushima. For Chernobyl, 56 deaths are attributed to the accident itself, and between 4000 to 985,000 to cancer traceable to the accident.  So starting with 'more or less' equal INES level, we could fairly rate Chernobyl at 2000-493,000 times 'worse' than Fukushima.  On a strictly objective basis, then, the Fukushima disaster, though about as serious as it gets, isn't even close to the Chernobyl disaster in terms of human casualties, and on the more cold-eyed 'what exactly happened and how bad was it' criteria of INES, it's certainly not worse.  Now that we've gone over the objective criteria, though, let's consider the more socially and culturally subjective criteria. Let's consider something less dramatic, such as, say, a civil engineering failure -- bridge collapse, elevator drop, phone poles toppling, take your pick. While on a strict one-to-one comparison, these same events are not objectively 'worse' in one place than another, if we're completely honest we're less surprised if they occur in projects built by Soviet engineering than in Japanese engineering.  That's because since sometime in the 1970s, Japanese quality control and strict engineering standards rapidly outpaced the infamously dodgy engineering of the Soviet era (such as that which built the Chernobyl nuclear facility). We almost expect bad things to happen there -- but much less so in Japan. Japan in fact has arguably the highest engineering standards in the world, challenged only by the best German engineering.  We know without having to look it up or even think about it very much that the standards Fukushima was built to far surpass those of Chernobyl, maybe by orders of magnitude. There's just no credible comparison. (This, even though the Soviets were capable of world-class engineering on a par with the best in the world. They were just very inconsistent about it, and often very lax. Sadly, the same was often true of their training and operations -- which in fact was central to the Chernobyl disaster.)  Considered from that perspective, Fukushima was 'worse' because nothing like that should have happened in a place like Japan. As much as Cherynobyl is an extreme example of the failure of Soviet engineering, we're just not that surprised: If a really awful nuclear disaster was going to happen somewhere, the Soviet Union seems one of the most likely places. But Japan? No, never. So when a Chernobyl-scale event occurs there, then it seems subjectively worse to us only for that reason -- and by some fair arguments is worse for that reason.  So whether Fukushima is worse than Chernobyl really depends on your perspective."

IsItBullshit,346wug,ThrowingChicken,3,Wed Apr 29 16:56:27 2015 UTC,"I don't have particulars on them, I'm sorry, and I have looked. It's difficult in this case because the manmade disaster occurred in the context of a serious natural disaster in the same area that killed thousands of people. In the aftermath of both, the majority of casualties are believed to be attributable to the extreme conditions and widespread confusion of emergency evacuation, though the evacuation is also credited with saving many lives. Nevertheless, a cold-eyed evaluation supposes that the evacuation killed more people than it likely saved. (Which is not an indictment of the evacuation as such, generally regarded as a prudent emergency measure. Rather, these deaths are apparently attributable to its poor prosecution -- poor organization, poor communication, and so on.)  As for casualties directly and exclusively attributable to the nuclear accident, only time will tell. There are none that resulted within the plant in the event's immediate wake. The ""at least two"" figure derives from a report that ""2 to 12"" deaths will result from exposure to excess ionizing radiation as a direct consequence of the accident. These people were at the site at the time of the accident and involved in its mitigation. The report was prepared in 2012 by John Ten Hoeve and Mark Z. Jacobson of Stanford University and may be viewed here. These deaths are predicted but have not yet occurred. They are based on known exposures of specific workers. While an order of magnitude lower than the levels of similar worker exposures at Chernobyl, they are nevertheless well above clinically prescribed lifetime exposure limits, and there is good reason to expect these people to suffer untimely early deaths as a direct result of their exposure.  It's perhaps worth adding at this point, since it's a concern of others in the world who fear they may have themselves been exposed to distantly deposited radioactive products of the accident, that a widely-circulated paper claiming as many as 14,000 U.S. deaths from the accident has been widely discredited. It is based on a measured increase in certain kinds of deaths in some California cities that it purports suffered low-dose exposures resulting from the accident. However, those same kinds of deaths are actually lower than average over the same period in some other places (including in California) known to have received higher doses; further, there is no clinically known mechanism for early death resulting from the low dosages measured. Rather, any of many other causes is much more likely to be the cause, such as radon emissions from California's extensive active geological system, or any of countless chemicals used in agricultural and industrial processes in the region. From the statistics at the root of the paper, though, there is no rational way to link those deaths to Fukushima."

The words mean different things, and which one you choose to use is not arbitrary.  The other, somewhat more linguistic reason why this is misleading is because languages often have nouns which inflect or change form depending on their role in the sentences. For example, Russian learners are taught that each noun inflects six ways depending on its role in the sentence (subject, direct object, indirect object, etc...). But it's still disingenuous to say ""OMG, Russian has  six words for mustache!"" based on this fact. Those ""six words"" are just six spellings of the same root word. They don't count as different words because the meaning never changes -- only the grammatical function.

Mass media coverage was based on excerpts from a French student radio interview with sport specialist Jean-Denis Rouillon, in Besancon, France. Over the past 15 years, Rouillon recruited 330 “sports” women between the ages of 18 to 35, and asked them to go without a bra. Rouillon used calipers and a slide ruler to record changes to the women’s breasts. He made no mention of the women’s weight, height, bra sizes, or whether a control group was enlisted to test his thesis. Ultimately, published research on the bio-mechanics of breast movement (led by women researchers) cite the reduction in pain and discomfort as the reason female athletes should wear sports bras. Right now credible research points to skin in-elasticity, repeated weight gain and loss, cigarette smoking, genetics, and multiple pregnancies as the main reason for sagging breasts."

They don't wish to engage on discussion so much as partake in an echo chamber. It's sad really.  I think I saw a post they made about pedophiles a while back. Someone on Reddit admitted to being one, but that they understand it is wrong to have sex with children so they don't and said they never will. That they will just continue their life with their SO. SRS took it at face value and started saying what a disgusting person they were. If you assert pedophilia is how people's brains are hardwired, they say you advocate for child rape.

Nobody said anything about either one being more offensive, just that that defense is really poor because the comparison doesn't really make sense because in intent saying ""faggot"" is worse.   ""Circlejerk"" is not an excuse for being stupid. Every time you do something stupid and then say ""oh I was just circlejerking I don't believe that what I was parodying is wrong"" you're no better than the people who say stupid shit and say ""oh I was just trolling lol.""

IsItBullshit,33md08,spwf,4,Thu Apr 23 20:16:56 2015 UTC,"The hospital one might be just because it's a highly stressful and efficient environment, so having people spacing out on their phones, getting sudden calls, etc. could be really annoying, especially to patients who need rest. Given the average number of people in a hospital at one time, the number of phones ringing could be really annoying, especially if you have an injury or are in pain and trying to sleep. Doctors and nurses need to concentrate on a lot of things and keep track of many patients at once in addition to listening to medical equipment or alarms in patient monitoring, so phone ringing would probably get in the way a lot. Also, a lot of people just freeze (or walk really slowly and obliviously) while texting, which would probably be a major annoyance. I think those reasons alone are enough to not use a cell phone.  The phone charging/gas station one is a persistent myth probably because most people don't know how cars work well enough so they become wary of using anything inside the car while pumping gas. In reality, the phone charging/cigarette lighter port in your car does not use any gasoline (obviously) and only uses the battery. I can think of two explanations as to why the phone charging myth exists:   People are confused as to what works using gasoline and what doesn't, as I mentioned before. The AC in your car works with engine power, and therefore needs gasoline to run. A lot of people don't know that. There may therefore be confusion over what uses gas and what doesn't. In order for you to use the cell phone charger, your car has to be turned on (to my knowledge) so perhaps some people are worried that you would leave the ENGINE on and not just turn on the car?"

The one place in a refueling car where a spark (which phones don't produce anyway) could ignite the fuel is right next to the nozzle (seriously, gasoline only ignites in a fairly narrow band of concentrations) and a spark from your hand to the car could cause a fire.  It only takes a couple instances of young people on their phones not grounding themselves for the myth to start that it's cell phones blowing up gas stations instead of the real culprit–static discharge.

IsItBullshit,33md08,Number_06,2,Sun Apr 26 18:37:58 2015 UTC,"It is not always true, but it is often true.  For petrol to ignite, it needs to be vapourised at about 8% to air. On a hot day when the bucket is left to stand a cloud of such concentration can readily form above the liquid in the bucket so permitting ignition. Nevertheless, it is perfectly possible at normal temperatures with a freshly poured bucket of petrol to extinguish a cigarette by throwing it in.  There is a Mythbusters episode where they completely fail to ignite a fuel tank full of petrol despite shooting it with incendiary rounds. Fighter plane fuel tanks in WW II were protected from ignition caused by enemy fire with the use of rubber bladders that prevented the fuel/air vapour from forming in the tank.  This is one of the reasons that liquid fuels can be so dangerous. The requirement of a vapour cloud prior to ignition can mean that such ignition is often unexpected.  So, yes the cigarette is true, but if you must try it at home, don't."

The supposed story is that early humans used alcohol to sanitize water, and ones that were able to break it down then passed their enzymes on. Something along those lines. It's also the reason Asians are not as adept at breaking alcohol down. They did not have this issue so they didn't develop the enzymes as efficiently"
IsItBullshit,33fbjy,neuropanic,7,Wed Apr 22 19:42:37 2015 UTC,"you're not wrong, yet you kind of are.   Let me clarify something. Pretty much all the things we ingest, drink, breathe are toxic, it all boils down to its dosage/concentration.  Think of the oxygen we breathe. Atmospheric concentration perfect; a bit more concentrated has different use like in hyperbaric chambers; increase the concentration a bit more and even something that is absolutely vital for our survivor like oxygen, can become a deadly poison.   Now, back to alcohol. Sure it's true that we evolved to ""break down"" alcohol more efficiently, but that's just how we evolved. That's a fact, nothing to worry about or to draw any conclusions on (unless you wanted just talk about human evolution, in which case sorry I misinterpreted your post). Low dosage of alcohol for long periods, or even high for a very short periods, can be good for you, depending on the situation and the person. But generally speaking, low and constant alcohol intake has the property to decrease the risk of thrombosis, and cardiovascular disease in general. Which is a very good thing of course (here's a decent review on the topic.).   Alcohol can also be pretty useful in the short run and at a bit higher dosage, during long flights. Heard about stretching your legs during long flights?That's because with altitude there's an higher risk of thrombosis. But what do we know has anti-thrombotic properties? Alcohol! So, next time they offer you gin&tonic (or a couple of glasses of wine), think about your health and sip it happily.   On the other hand, alcohol is doing all these wonderful things because it reduces blood coagulation. If the person drinking wine has already a reduced coagulation ( for example, due to specific medications or to genetic traits, like in the case of Hemophilia) then is not advisable for this person to drink. Same if you cut yourself, I would advise against drinking wine or vodka.  Final thought: if after reading this and you're thinking ""hell yeah, I gonna start drinking a glass of wine a day from now on"" (which I totally recommend- again a glass, not a bottle-) always choose red over white. Red wine contains more flavonoids than white wine, and flavonoids not only are great for the taste but also have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.     TL;DR: *So a glass of wine a day, can save you from an heart attack in the long run.   *Choose red over white wine  *Every time you take a long flight (more than 3/4hrs), drink that delicious gin&tonic. It can save you from a nasty thrombosis.    BUT if you have problems with your coagulation, or you cut yourself with a saw, please don't drink."

But where do you get that I believe in pseudoscience?  You seem to be rejecting that antioxidants and free radicals are a thing, but perhaps I am misinterpreting you. Free radicals have been linked to a myriad of diseases, including alzheimers and many neuro degenerative and other age related conditions. They are generated in the break down of hydrogen peroxide for instance.  Antioxidants are not the miracle drugs they are often portrayed as, and a lot of their effects are under harsh scrutiny. However there have been some promising results for their effects related to certain types of cancer. In regards to the wine, that may very well be one of the debunked ones, I was just confirming that free radicals and the role of antioxidants in neutralizing them is accurate.  The misleading part is that antioxidants is actually a very broad umbrella term. It encompasses a lot of different compounds that share a common feature but each have their own properties as well.  Your body actually makes many antioxidants naturally in order to deal with the free radical problem. There's heavy research currently going on regarding their effects of a lot of age related conditions. These of course take a considerable amount of time though.

Meaning, you can 'cure' them by almost any means imaginable -- pray to Ba'al, binge-watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer, go mall-walking four days a week from exactly 9:02 a.m. to exactly 11:04 a.m., eat a particular foodstuff you consider magical (can literally be almost anything that's not actually harmful), anything. Because most disorders will clear up on their own no matter what do or don't do, so long as you don't do anything to make them worse.  That's why people believe in this shit, even though actual scientists try to explain to them that they're just giving their money away to sly hucksters with carefully crafted marketing. It worked for snake-oil salesmen over a century ago, too, for exactly the same reason: Most of the time, it really did seem to work. Because almost anything would have 'worked' -- or nothing. But you can't make money selling people nothing, so you have stuff like this instead. And yes, it is bullshit.  Where it can get confusing is that in many cases, the origins of these ridiculous ideas are actually sincere, and may have even started with intelligent, educated, and well-meaning people, who happened to be completely wrong about something, or maybe just a little nuts. When Dr. Pol Henry devised gemmotherapy in the late 1950s, he probably really believed in it. He just happened to be wrong, and being an educated person he should have known better, but the point is that, as Wikipedia puts it:   Gemmotherapy, like many other alternative therapies, lacks an evidential basis and is not accepted as an efficacious treatment by the scientific community.   Amusingly, this statement is appended with the requisite ""[citation needed]"" . But of course, something that's not been validated does not require a citation of not having been validated. I don't need any proof that there are no unicorns in my sock drawer, in order for that claim to be credible. I would rather need some kind of evidence if I claimed that there were.  Likewise, no evidence or documentation is required to refute extraordinary claims. It is rather for those making those claims to provide their own evidence that there's anything to them. And so far, there is no such evidence for gemmotherapy -- other than the false 'evidence' that many people who try it get better. But most people would get better most of the time with or without it; the only difference would be having more money still in their possession, and a greater likelihood of trusting science-based help when it's really needed."

IsItBullshit,33dc8h,sylban,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:53:21 2015 UTC,"A very similar thing happens with car repair, and most people who've owned cars have had this same experience. The difference is that in that case, it's much easier to objectively prove that there's no rational connection between the perceived cause and effect.  When you have a car serviced, it almost always seems to run better -- even when the work that was done had nothing to do with how well it runs. Replace a wiper? Just listen to that engine purr! Had the interior detailed? Wow, check out that smooth handling! New stereo put in? Holy cats, is this my car, or a new one?!  This is of course a trick our brains play on us, and works by crude association. The car is better in some way, and we immediately (though irrationally) imagine we experience that 'betterness' as the one thing most intimate to our direct use of it: how it drives. Even if what was done had absolutely nothing to do with that. Even when you're conscious of this, and tell yourself it's only an illusion, and can prove that to yourself, you still feel it.  The effect wears off, of course, soon enough. But it repeats the next time, and nearly every time, no matter what was actually done.  The same is the case with fake medicines, and is well known as the placebo effect. If you believe you're getting treatment, then you'll usually feel better -- even if you're not. And you can have that same experience with each 'treatment'. The effect is so powerful, that it's been found that fake morphine is 'stronger' than fake aspirin. And, even weirder, is the 'nocebo' effect, where patients who sincerely and fervently don't believe that real (clinically proven) medicine is effective get less result from it.  The brain is a very weird and very powerful thing, and the brain-body connection, still not well understood, is surprisingly profound. You can reduce your sensation of pain by using optics to make your visible injury appear smaller. As in, you can literally look at your cut finger the wrong way through binoculars, so that it looks tiny and far away, and it will hurt less. You can cheer yourself up just by smiling and laughing, because your hypothalmus honestly believes that if you're smiling and laughing, then you must be happy, so you start to feel happier. (The same is true for any other facial gestures. Make an angry face, and you will start to feel angry. It's stupid and bizarre, but it totally works.) Craving some food you know you shouldn't eat? Just close your eyes and visualize eating it, as vividly as you can. Your brain will believe that you really ate it, and the craving will subside. Most food 'addictions' are just habits, and habits are just hardwired reinforcements of routine behaviours. Stop the behaviour, and the habit fades. Stop doing that thing for six weeks or longer -- addiction gone. (Works for just about anything else, too, from cigarettes to cocaine.) The hardest part about working out is going to the gym. So make just going there your only goal, and chances are you'll feel like working out once you get there. To develop any habit, just repeat it enough times, reliably enough, and your brain will make you want to do it.  I could go on and on, but you get the idea. All this stuff is in our heads. When scientists test a medical treatment, they use complex methods that are meant to get around all the ways we humans fool ourselves all the time. And then they do peer review -- retest, with other scientists and other subjects -- to see if the results match or not. It's never enough to merely establish what appears to be a correlation.  As with all mind tricks, awareness is the defence. But you run into a cruel catch-22 with people who believe spurious things: They're already clearly not well versed in the nature of evidence, doubt, and reason. If they were, then they probably wouldn't be in the situation they're in. And there are other factors, such as selection bias, confirmation bias, and more, that all work against real enlightenment. The most far gone are those who can no longer distinguish suspicion from probability. Once you've weighed anchor from the shores of objective fact, there's nowhere you can't travel on the ocean of the mind, stirred with tempests of paranoia and the certainty that somewhere just past the horizon is the undiscovered land of truth that everyone else is blind to or too afraid (or too cowed, or too brainwashed) to seek. Ironically, such people often feel heroic and courageous in this, and sorry for everyone else who can't see or accept Tha Trewth. This is why you're wasting your time if you argue with people like Birthers or Truthers. Facts don't enter into it. You are just plain wrong if you disagree, because it's so obvious what's really true.  Sadly, this is even more true when it comes to things like health and wellness, where objective facts are hard to come by, and much harder to demonstrate outside of a proper scientific study. And you're up against one more thing: It's impossible to prove a negative. Meaning, you can't prove that homeopathy doesn't work, only that it didn't appear to work in a given case. Which is, by no coincidence, very similar to the conclusion that even praying didn't save someone, for any number of unprovable reasons (not faithful enough, was their time, prayed to wrong deity, ""mysterious ways,"" ""Ours is not to question why,"" etc.), that doesn't prove that praying doesn't work -- because sometimes it does! (Though to my knowledge, no one has ever prayed a lost limb back into existence. Not sure why that's a universal exception. Just one of those mysteries, apparently.)  You can't prove that these things don't work, and they often seem to, for the people who believe in them. That's enough to keep people on it, and keep them from being talked out of them. People have to convince themselves, on their own time, and by their own will. They have to be willing to accept that it might not be true, and due to the human habit of foreclosure (the rejection of all contradictory points of view, regardless of argument or evidence), that will rarely happen under duress."

Basically, if I have a room with 100 sick people, and I give 50 of them medicine and don't give medicine to the other 50; the ones who get medicine will recover faster, on average.  Even if the ""medicine"" I gave them was sugar pills.  Because the human brain/body is a complex thing, and actually performs better if you can convince it that it should be performing better.  So Homeopathy and Gemmotherapy and eery other similar medicine does actually heal you. But no more than any other sugar pill that you are told is medicine will. Which is why medical science uses double-blind studies: they are trying to see if the medicine is better than ""medicine"" (sugar pills you are told is medicine)."

It's hard to argue with high cure rates with minimal drawbacks.  So, is it bullshit? Technically no: they do provide support (in the form of the Placebo Effect).  But since I can't find any double-blind studies on Gemmotherapy (which isn't gems, but flower buds), so it's probably not better than the placebo effect."
IsItBullshit,33dc8h,hkdharmon,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:25:35 2015 UTC,"It is likely the placebo effect just like homeopathy. The placebo effect is that sometimes people feel better simply because they think they are supposed to. You can give someone pretty much anything (tap water) and if you convince them they are supposed to feel better, they often actually feel better.   To further complicate things, sometimes people just get better on their own. We can heal wounds on our own and we have a pretty effective immune system. Placebos can sometimes help you sit down and wait for your body to do what it was going to do anyway.  The problem is that it really does nothing to cure actual diseases. The placebo effect won't stop cancer, or a bad infection, or things like that. And often people will use this stuff instead of real medicine that works better than the placebo effect. And if your natural immune system doesn't stop the disease, it is now even worse.  It might do something, since there are real medicines that come from plants. Aspirin is a good example, but I do not see anyone testing it properly to make sure. I would call it BS because it is marketing itself as something better than it actually is."

IsItBullshit,32l1uk,big_poop_breakfast,32,Wed Apr 15 00:44:30 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Imagine if every time you saw the color red, it hurt. As in, you physically felt pain.  If you saw a little red, it wouldn't hurt much. Most of the time, you could tolerate the pain from seeing a little red here and there. But if you saw a lot of red, it would hurt a lot.  So you learn where you can find places with no red in them. So that if you ever did see a lot of red, and it felt like your body was on fire and every little bit of red you saw made it worse; you could run (RUN) to the nearest safe space, and not have to see red for long enough that you could have the pain pass, and be back to normal again.  For people with PTSD, domestic violence, etc., it's a similar thing; the trigger is different, and maybe it's not physical pain: maybe it's fear, or flashbacks, or some other unwelcome emotional response. But it's the same basic setup: something triggers you, and you have a deeply unwelcome response.  So having some place to retreat to; a place that you KNOW you won't be triggered, is very helpful to retreat from the trigger and recover."

IsItBullshit,32l1uk,sniktawekim,4,Tue Apr 14 20:46:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, and no.  Yes, because in the short term the mind and body is relieved of stress factors/stimuli, and the body can quickly resume baseline function.  No, because in the long term, avoiding stimuli can increase said stimuli's effect when a person is subjected to them at a later time. Consider this:  You (your brain) is afraid of spiders. Suddenly, a spider appears. You (your brain) goes frantic (thank you amygdala), and you either fight, run or freeze. If you run (ie. avoid) stimuli, your brain will condition itself accordingly. Spider increases fear. Run away. Running decreases fear. The brain never unlearns spider/fear-dichotomy - in fact it becomes stronger by avoidance.  Same goes with any fear-related psychological disorder.  Another example: Do you know anyone suffering from fear of heights? Do you think it would be logical to overcome this fear of heights by never facing heights?  A ""safe room"" is only good for you if you want to continue suffering."

IsItBullshit,32lrnx,Koooooj,3,Tue Apr 14 21:27:49 2015 UTC,"Where did you get the idea that iq tests shouldn't be only pattern recognition?   Every description of IQ tests that I've ever seen uses more than just visual pattern recognition.  It's certainly a popular question type, but I've never heard of a respected IQ test only using that kind of question.  I'd like to see a Mensa test, since I really doubt they're as one-dimensional as this test was.  Literally every single question was the exact same format—a 3x3 grid of symbols and you have to fill in the bottom right.  Most IQ tests seem to use mathematical and verbal analogies (finger is to hand as toe is to ____), visual problems (e.g. here's a cube with symbols on each face; which one of these could be the surface of the cube, then they show the faces adjacent to one another all flat (a net), logic, and so on.   Does answering a on the second half mean you answered correctly on all of the first ones? Because I'm on cell, but if this is the test I think it is, some of the later ones are close to impossible. Answering half right and then some more might be 103, it's not unreasonable.   I believe I answered the first half all corrrectly; I stopped when I had to start thinking more than a few seconds on each one.     Of course it's not a real test, but... What the hell is?   One which has actually been developed to give a mean, median, and mode IQ of 100 on a statistically significant population that's being tested.  IQ gets a lot of crap for being an attempt to describe people with a single number, but it's used in real science.  I would describe a non-real IQ test as one where you cannot reasonably expect your results on that test to be an accurate indicator of what you would score on other, well constructed tests.   If you compare this to others who have done the same, and one of you gets significantly better, that person probably is better at recognizing shapes and focus, for what it's worth.   I agree.  The test isn't useless.  It just likely isn't a true IQ test, in the sense that it doesn't give you a good measure of where you stand among the population.  It's fine for comparative data; it just doesn't give you much more information than that."

Actually they were even simpler, the only difficulty was to do the questions really fast as there was like 15 minutes to do 40 questions and a lot of shuffling papers and finding the right box to cross. This is what an iq test is. There are other ways to measure intelligence, though.   You might know better than mensa, but I still think it's a mistake to answer so slam-dunky on this question.   Is the iq test supposed to be for the world population? Iq in different countries can vary quite a lot. You can't just say it's supposed to give the mean or median 100 for all that it has tested. Do you know how many people of those who do the mensa test get in? About half. It's quite a biased sample, though.   Iq tests are all very subjective and difficult to compare, but yes, if iq tests are ever going to be good for anything, it is to get into mensa, and for that, this test is very similar.  I know what tests you are talking about and I have seen and done them. They will give you some kind of analysis of what you are good at etc. You mentioned you thought that this test might be a scam and that you shouldn't be giving them money.

In people who don't have very compromised immune systems, it's unlikely to do any systemic harm. It can cause superficial infections, particularly vaginal yeast infections, but those are easy to treat.  It's easy to make an association between candida infections and ill health, because it's mostly very sick people who get serious infections with it, and for the more minor infections, they're most common after being sick and taking antibiotics. But that's because antibiotics kill some harmless bacteria too, and harmless bacteria help keep growth of pathogenic bacteria and fungi like candida in check. So antibiotics make most people with vaginas more prone to yeast infections for a little while after."

IsItBullshit,329g8m,abisnailtrail,6,Sat Apr 11 20:03:10 2015 UTC,Microphones are transducers and technically may not need to use power to function. However if the processing components have no power then there is no way for the outputted signal from the microphone to be used or stored in any way. Digital devices usually have capacitors in them that charge up under power and then discharge slowly when the power is gone to help keep clocks running when the phone has no other power source. You can notice this on some digital alarm clocks when you disconnect the power then reconnect it some time later and the time is still correct. So there is power in the phone when you take the battery out but likely not enough to run the processor. Although this would be a handy feature for anti theft. If a thief takes your phone and thinks he's smart by taking out the battery and it had enough stored charge to work a mic or a location based function then he would be easier to catch.

Modern phones do not ever completely turn off unless the battery is dead or removed. Instead, they enter a ""standby"" mode that - at the very least - monitors the power button so it knows when to come out of standby mode.   Using that for nefarious purposes with a regular mobile phone is difficult because the software on them is not meant to be updated very often and their standby modes are a bit harder to screw with.  However, if you have a smartphone, you probably have automatic update enabled, which connects to a secure server every once in a while to download and install software automatically. Certain organizations have a record of setting up ""fake"" towers that let your mobile connect and then pretend to be that secure server, letting your phone automatically download software that spies for them."

The reality here is that your 'feeling that most support weakens your feet' is irrelevant. Your feelings don't matter, your health does.  The best advice you will get from this thread is that you really should go to a podiatrist. Since you're not in pain, you likely won't have to do anything.

Whether you need orthotics will depend on a few different factors, but mainly how flat your foot is, and a podiatrist is the only person who can tell you. If you have very flat feet like myself, the joints in your toes undergo 2-3x the amount of pressure that they normally would, which in the short term doesn't affect you. However it can cause problems later in life that may even result in surgery to correct them (generally ligament damage and excessive wear on the big toe joint) orthotics prevent this."

I wore orthotics for a few years and eventually found that my feet were strong enough to support a certain level of activity without collapsing the arch and causing pain. So now I don't wear them anymore and just try to strengthen my feet, and the pain only occurs with long distance running, which I do rarely. Look up ankle stability exercises..

Prior to the current kind, I had those ones where you stand on the pad and it determines which insole you need and then you pay $60 for them.  Those did not work nearly as well at making long standing periods feel better.  On the flip side, I tend to be barefoot during a lot of the summer, (and the winter if I am inside), so it's clearly not crucial.  I remember when I was younger I used to get nerve pinches or something in my ankle that would make that leg collapse due to the pain.  I thought this was because of the flat arch, but I can't be sure.  Since the new insoles, I haven't had that issue.  So it's either placebo effect, or there's something to a nice supportive insoles.

IsItBullshit,3271ne,Finch2192,1 point,Sat Apr 11 15:03:02 2015 UTC,"Okay. So basically this guys arguments are that that our understanding our understanding of physics does not allow for new forces on ""everyday"" atoms, and that our understanding of physics is complete and unassailable, due to nothing else showing up in experimentation.    This doesn't quite get the football to the goal he's trying to make.  It's still a possibility that ghosts (or souls, or gods, or whatever) exist in a physical state which could not be considered ""everyday"" physics.  It's also possible that they exist in a state outside of physics.  Now you may be thinking that if they exist outside of physics, then they cannot interact with our world and don't exist in any meaningful way.  But that's not necessarily the case.    Imagine that that you have a very smart computer, on a computer network.  None of the computers have any external sensors (cameras or microphones), but they all interact with eachother over some kind of network protocol.  So you have one very smart, and well-programmed computer that can try to go through the network and attempt to understand how everything works.  And it succeeds, and gets a complete understanding of how the computer network structure, and computer programming itself, work.  If you tasked this computer with the question of whether or not humans exist (or dogs, or baseballs, or whatever), it would say that they cannot.  They cannot, because they cannot exist in its understanding of how computer space works, and that their understanding of how computer space works is complete.  It's true that its understanding is complete, and it's true that its understanding does not allow for humans to exist.  But it is wrong in assuming that computer space (which is all the computer has experienced) is the underlying set of laws which commands everything, and cannot be acted on by outside forces.  In the same way, we may be wrong to assume that physics, or quantum field theory, are the underlying forces which control everything and there are no outside forces which may periodically act on them.  I also find it funny that he talks so long about how we shouldn't assume things are true, just because we cannot disprove them, then later on says how Quantum Field Theory must be true because we have not had any experiment which comes close to disproving it."
IsItBullshit,3271ne,Azrael11000,-1,Sat Apr 11 19:21:58 2015 UTC,"I also find it funny that he talks so long about how we shouldn't assume things are true, just because we cannot disprove them, then later on says how Quantum Field Theory must be true because we have not had any experiment which comes close to disproving it.   In this paragraph you have completely failed to comprehend the critical concept of falsifiability. Which is why you probably do not understand why this paragraph;   In the same way, we may be wrong to assume that physics, or quantum field theory, are the underlying forces which control everything and there are no outside forces which may periodically act on them.   is correctly described as not even wrong.   It's true that its understanding is complete, and it's true that its understanding does not allow for humans to exist. But it is wrong in assuming that computer space (which is all the computer has experienced) is the underlying set of laws which commands everything, and cannot be acted on by outside forces.   Within the confines of the network, your computer is completely correct when it reasons that humans do not exist, and further until humans interact with it he has no reason to assume they exist. That said, he will have detected input devices like keyboards and mice, he will also be aware of his capacity via screens and speakers to transmit. So his worldview will be predicated on the knowledge that his network is constructed to facilitate interaction with other entities, and so he will allow for their existence in his model.  So, as your example so clearly demonstrates, within the confines of reality we are correct to assume that ghosts do not exist. Further, we know that there are no particles and forces (keyboards and screens) that would facilitate interaction beyond our reality, not because of the absence of evidence, but because of the absence of evidence that should've been there when we did the experiments.  This is why some of your fellow humans built CERN.  So, this escape hatch;   It's also possible that they exist in a state outside of physics. Now you may be thinking that if they exist outside of physics, then they cannot interact with our world and don't exist in any meaningful way.

In this scenario, the computer is not correct in reasoning that humans don't exist, because humans do exist.  The existence of keyboards and monitors wouldn't really prove anything.

IsItBullshit,31pxqv,RAPMEX,24,Tue Apr 7 06:04:31 2015 UTC,"1 - It CAN be good for health but, much like the rest of the things people eat, just because something is vegan doesn't mean it is healthy.  Peanut butter is vegan - if you ate nothing but peanut butter you'd die.  My friend owns and operates a very successful vegan bakery.  Everything in it is just as ""bad"" for you as the non-vegan variety it just happens to not contain milk or eggs.  There are very healthy vegans out there and there are very healthy omnivores out there.   Neither dietary option is a cure-all.  In general, if you ate a very clean, well planned, well rounded vegan diet you would likely be ""healthier"" than almost anyone you'd encounter in your day to day life (if you're an American anyway) but the exact same diet with the addition of proper animal protein would be just as healthy.  2 - the way animals are treated and processed at large scale ""factory farm"" operations is abhorrent.  I don't really give a shit about ""animal rights"" but holy shit.  Just go on youtube because I've seen things I never want to see again.  This dovetails nicely into something that is much more important than any ""ism"" and that's making an effort to know where your food comes from.  3 - Humans have evolved to be omnivores.  That means we can thrive eating a very wide variety of things ranging from nothing but plants to nothing but animal proteins.  I'm of the opinion that it is easier for us to thrive by meeting somwhere in the middle.  4 - bonus answer - your average american doesn't eat enough raw, fresh, fruits and vegetables.  We also eat way to much processed crap in general and way, way, way too many grains and refined starches and flours.  If you're looking to improve your overall health and want to work in broad strokes you should severly limit your intake of refined carbohydrates, severely increase your intake of fresh vegetables with a specific focus on dark colored ones and dark leafy greens, eat about 1/4 the amount of fruit as vegetables, and make sure your proteins are responsibly sourced and minimally processed.  Increasing your intake of fats will help dramatically as well - preferably in the form of non-hydrogenated oils (so use real butter), coconut oil, olive oil, and avocados."
IsItBullshit,31pxqv,rodion_kjd,5,Tue Apr 7 15:56:57 2015 UTC,"1 - I think the bonus answer above gets this one the closest. In the US we eat about twice as much meat as the world average (which is skewed up because of us and similar countries) and over 5 times as much as developing countries. A healthy diet is some fraction of what we're eating. Being vegetarian or vegan gets all the advantages of eating less meat, with very few negatives. Getting enough protein really isn't a problem, and things like getting enough B12 is easy unless you have other dietary restrictions.  2 - Not all animals are raised in factory farms, but most of them are. If we all got our meat from local farms where you could go out and see the animals, that would be amazing. If most people were reminded of what it's like at a factory farm, I think this is what would happen naturally.  3 - we definitely evolved to be omnivores. But we also evolved to eat a lot of raw fruits, veggies, roots and grains, and a tiny amount of meat. If you're really worried about a healthy diet the best advice is to cook for yourself. You'll eat less sugar, more raw foods, and less meat (because it's a pain in the ass compared to veggies), and probably less fat, and have more fun doing it (hopefully :)  A big thing that isn't talked about is that meat uses up an incredible amount of resources - land, water, fossil fuels, and is probably the leading cause of virtually every major environmental problem from deforestation to extinctions to global warming. We don't all have to become vegans, but if the industrialized countries of the world reduced their consumption it would likely improve our chances of finding a sustainable way to support ourselves more than anything else we could do."
IsItBullshit,31pxqv,newdefinition,17,Tue Apr 7 21:15:21 2015 UTC,"I asked my biologist sister about this once, and her response was scientific - our digestive systems don't resemble vegetarian systems, nor do they resemble carnivore systems.  We are 100% omnivores, and in her opinion, that's how we should eat.  That said - our society definitely over-eats meat.  When we were all hunters and gatherers, meat would come far less frequently, and in smaller amounts, and that is probably what's best for our bodies - mostly vegetables, fruits, and grains, with a supplement of meat once in awhile."
IsItBullshit,31pxqv,EvanFistfight,22,Tue Apr 7 11:47:19 2015 UTC,"Geneticist here. Your sister is right about the fact that our digestive evolution is truly omnivorous, but she's wrong if she takes that to indicate that that dictates what we ought to eat. It indicates what we can eat. There are a ton of other factors to consider when we try to figure out what we should be eating."
IsItBullshit,31pxqv,ShrimpyPimpy,5,Tue Apr 7 13:20:50 2015 UTC,"Absolutely - her view was based entirely on what type of system we have and what other mammals have the same types of system.  As a geneticist, how do you respond to the question?  I would be interested in knowing a nutritionists point of view too.  With the expertise only of someone who once worked in food services, while I won't comment scientifically, I will say observationally that folks with vegetarian diets generally have more colour and a a glow about them, and truthfully, the most beautiful and healthy looking people I worked with had raw food vegan diets.  I stress, this is not science, but just my observations."
IsItBullshit,31pxqv,EvanFistfight,8,Tue Apr 7 14:06:56 2015 UTC,"I think my view as a scientist mostly just applies to how our evolution works. So while eating animals definitely was a benefit to our ancient ancestors, there's really no evidence of our continued need of it in modern times. It was beneficial because it was a source of nutrition in times when foods may have been scarce in winter or drought or whatnot.  And I personally don't eat animals because biologically they're just so damn similar to not just our cats and dogs, but to ourselves even. Developmental genes in even mice show a huge similarity to our own in so many ways. So even though I don't think mice or chickens or pigs should be treated exactly the same as a fellow human, I think that genetically, biologically, psychologically... these animals ought to be considered as individuals who deserve better than to be farmed.  Also, I notice the same thing about raw foodists... that shit is tough, but goddamn it seems to be working for them!"
IsItBullshit,31pxqv,ShrimpyPimpy,2,Tue Apr 7 17:23:01 2015 UTC,"There's a serious confounding factor at work, though - vegetarians and vegans tend to be more health-conscious in general. More likely to exercise, to keep their weight in a healthy range, to limit alcohol intake, to avoid smoking, etc. So it's very hard to tease apart whether it's the diet or overall effort towards health that's making the difference. (My guess is it's the latter, combined with most of them eating less processed food.)"
IsItBullshit,31pxqv,CadenceSpice,2,Thu Apr 9 01:41:42 2015 UTC,"That's absolutely true.  And folks who would go so far as to go through the headaches and self discipline necessary to maintain a raw food diet must already be extremely dedicated to healthy living.

I'd be interested in seeing a source on this claim if you know of a good one. This is purely anecdotal on my part so take it as you will, but I know a ton of vegans and vegetarians and they are almost all heavy smokers, heavier drinkers, and not generally inclined to exercise (aside from a couple that use bikes as their primary mode of transportation). I'm not saying I think you're wrong, but I've heard this claim from a few people and though I agree that it sounds intuitively true, no one has ever been able to say more than ""well obviously they do, they're vegans""."
IsItBullshit,31pxqv,TheArmchairSkeptic,3,Thu Apr 9 17:15:42 2015 UTC,"We are unable to make vitamin B12 and it isn't available from any natural plant sources, except trace amounts if the plants are contaminated with bacteria that make it. We also can't digest cellulose and our digestive systems are equipped to handle protein-rich, fat-rich, and some carbohydrate-rich foods. Humans are naturally omnivorous, with hunter-gatherer groups differing dramatically in plant to animal food ratios but none are 100% plant and almost none are 100% animal.  Eggs and dairy products, though, can supply enough B12 and animal proteins, so vegetarian diets qualify as omnivorous and are much easier to get adequate nutrition on than vegan diets.  A big benefit of a vegan diet is removal of a lot of junk food from your diet - but you can dramatically reduce your intake of processed junk food without eliminating meat (or eggs/cheese/etc. if that's more your thing)."

Some source material for you:  The China Study https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_China_Study  is a great, scientific, review of this subject that is based on a 20 year longitudinal study of the extreme benefits of a vegan diet.  Another great, although a bit more pop-culture/propoganda is ""Eat to Live"" by Joel Fuhrman. In this he attempts to destroy the myth of the Mediterranean Diet and explains how it has kind of fucked up our health and food culture in the USA. Fuhrman advocates a Vegan diet.  Also read 'The Omnivore's Dilemma"" by Michael Pollan in which he takes a critical eye to our relationship with food, how it effects our bodies and what not only our health needs are but also what our moral/ethical requirements are.  These 3 books really changed how I viewed not only Veganism vs Vegetarianism vs Omnivorous diets but also how I viewed my place in our food production system.   I think its Not Bullshit based on these 3 books, numerous others and my own personal experiencing experimenting with Veganism for a year (in which I lost over 20 lbs, returned to government BMI norms and dropped my cholesteral from Oh Shit You Might Die to a very mid-range normal)."

It really helps you understand how real speciesm is. As for health, humans do have the capability to eat an omnivorous diet. But based on what I've read, we really lean far closer to herbivores on the dietary spectrum than omnivores. All the meat we eat needs to be cooked, or we'd likely get sick. We have long intestines for digesting as much of nutrients as we can, compared to carnivores, who have short intestines to dispose of the meat before it begins rotting. We produce little hydrochloric acid, instead producing ptyalin for the digestion of starches. So we can eat meat, but, the way I look at it, is really necessary? Considering the devastating environmental effects animal agriculture has  on the world (climate change) it really just isn't necessary."

Water, land, feed, fertilizer, fuel, and waste disposal capacity are all finite resources needed for the process, and even more energy & water is used to make components like fertilizer or fuel, which ends up multiplying the negative effects of the industry tons of times more, way beyond the levels of scope people normally want to think about.

Evolution and biology-wise, humans are omnivores and have evolved to be omnivores. We require proteins most commonly found in meat and we also can't really survive purely on meat, so we eat both plants and animals.   As for moral concerns, it depends on how you define ""abuse."" There are lots of practices which seem sort of cruel in industrial farms such as keeping animals in very small enclosures and the entire process of artificial insemination brings up a lot of questions about whether or not you're raping the animal.

IsItBullshit,31ez5j,LittleHelperRobot,4,Sat Apr 4 18:12:40 2015 UTC,"Fasting can mean a spectrum of things. Some are not as bad for you as others. Some minor gaps in my knowledge are being filled in by Wikipedia:   Absolute fasting is giving up food and water for usually at least a day and sometimes more. I'm sure I don't have to tell you that NOT drinking any fluids is bad for you and can kill you. Seriously, a lack of water over a couple days will destroy your kidneys since you'll basically stop peeing. Abstaining from food but not water for an indeterminate period isn't nearly as bad for you but still not great. Fat is how your body stores extra calories for use later (as well as liver glucose but I don't want to get into that). You won't keel over as your body will keep you fed on reserved sugar and fat, but it's feeding you pure energy and you'll be missing out on all sorts of helpful nutrients, including the ones you don't usually consider to be nutritious, such as salt; as a society, we tend to eat too much salt, but it is also an ESSENTIAL electrolyte. Even in this type of fast you need to be consuming some vitamins and minerals to keep yourself healthy. You can literally die from drinking too much water and not eating enough salt. Skipping a meal now and then is perfectly safe and healthy. Some people actually advocate for ""grazing:"" forgoing meals altogether in favor for frequent, small snacks. I actually managed to lose a lot of weight this way once upon a time: I would make a big sandwich in the morning and put it in the fridge. Since my kitchen at the time was fairly centrally located, I'd pass through it a lot. Every time I'd pass through, I'd refill my water bottle and have a bite or two of sandwich. I never really felt hungry because I was constantly eating, but I never would actually site down and have a meal."
IsItBullshit,31ez5j,lostat,4,Sat Apr 4 13:44:06 2015 UTC,"Fasting is guaranteed to cause weight loss, but not the good kind. You're being too extreme here- you don't have to not eat anything to lose weight. Weight loss is only able to be achieved through eating less than you burn, and anyone who says otherwise is lying or misinformed. In other words, eat less food and don't drink coke. People will recommend exercise and exercise is good but people try to use it as a substitute for eating less and it simply doesn't work. You can cancel out a lot of exercise simply by drinking a coke.   I was able to lose weight through common sense, but from what I've heard most people find this difficult. That means you're going to have to count Calories. A dietary calorie is a measurement of the chemical energy stored in a food. Typically, an average person needs around 2000 dietary calories a day.  The exact number varies from person to person on things like height and gender but if you're fat, you consume more calories than you burn, plain and simple."

Fasting for very long periods of time to lose weight is dangerous; it will cause weight loss, but a large portion of what's lost will be muscle mass, and if it goes on long enough, organ tissue. It can also quickly cause vitamin and mineral deficiencies and electrolyte imbalances. Best-case scenario: you lose some fat and plenty of muscle and gain back more fat and less muscle after ending it, plus you feel lousy for awhile. Worst-case scenario: death.  Occasional, short-term fasting is safe for most people (not everyone); a day or up to a few days on a water or clear liquid diet can be done in preparation for medical procedures, when feeling nauseated with a brief illness like ""stomach flu"", or for religious reasons. But when you do that, the small amount of weight you lose is mostly water weight and waste matter, so it comes back when you resume your regular eating pattern and actual body fat loss is usually trivial."

Once your body's storage of glycogen is depleted, you burn muscle to provide it, since you can make glucose from proteins. It's not a very efficient process but it works. So you end up burning a mixture of fat and muscle; most of your organs can run on fat metabolism but your brain can't run on fat metabolism alone.  The ratio of muscle loss to fat loss while fasting is higher than the ratio of muscle gain to fat gain after a long fast or crash diet ends, if you don't take serious measures to prioritize muscle gain, and after a very long fast that will be even harder than usual."

People on restrictive diets may tend to eat less because they get sick of eating the same thing.  So it's calorie reduction that actually causes the weight loss, but the restrictive diet makes it easier to restrict calories.  In a related manner, diets containing lots of bulky, low-calorie foods can cause weight loss by increasing the sense of fullness.  So because you've filled up on cabbage, you don't eat as much calorie-dense food.  In the end, it's the fact that you are consuming fewer calories that will cause you to lose weight."
IsItBullshit,31aar2,runcibleme,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:09:46 2015 UTC,"The problem with looking at it this way though is that these kinds of diets work for losing weight in the short term, but they're basically useless for keeping it off. Say you go on the all cabbage (or whatever) diet for two weeks and you really stick to it (even though you want to murder someone after the first two days), and hey! You lose 10 pounds! Totally worth, right? Well, not really. It's great that you lost the weight, but as soon as you go off that diet you're just going to gain it all back, plus maybe even a few extra since you're now in the ""I'm looking good these days! I can eat whatever I want!"" mindset.   Realistically, if you want to get healthier and stay that way, you can't just go on a diet, you have to change your lifestyle for the long-term. And more importantly, you have to do it in a way that's not going to make you miserable, or else the change isn't going to stick. That means eating better (and probably less) overall, and making regular exercise a part of your routine but not to the extent where you're torturing yourself. Back when I had about 80 pounds to lose and was discussing how to go about it with my doctor, he actually told me that if I really, really wanted a chocolate bar, I should just eat the goddamn chocolate bar. It's not enough to only eat for the sake of staying alive, you need to be able to enjoy food as well. Because if you don't, and you're forcing yourself to eat only foods that you hate but serve your health goals, eventually your willpower is going to give out. And when it does, that shit is going to blow like the Three Gorges Dam and you're going to wake up a month later in a pile of twinkie wrappers and McDonald's bags wondering why those new pants you bought don't fit anymore.  It's also worth mentioning that many of these heavily restrictive diets advertise themselves with claims like ""lose 15 pounds in 15 days!"" or something similar, and you absolutely can do that if you're starving yourself, but most doctors strongly advise that people trying to lose weight should not be losing more than about 2 pounds per week. Losing weight any faster than that is a huge strain on the body and will most likely lead to the yo-yo effect, where you're losing 10 pounds in two weeks, gaining 12 over the next two, and rinse and repeat.

IsItBullshit,31aar2,AnthropomorphicPenis,8,Fri Apr 3 17:17:36 2015 UTC,Complete bullshit.  But imagine how nice your shits must at the end of fruit day.
IsItBullshit,31aar2,taicrunch,4,Fri Apr 3 12:17:15 2015 UTC,"Count your calories (eat less than you burn), stay away from foods that make you hungrier (sugar), and drink lots and lots of water. It's that simple"
IsItBullshit,31aar2,thekeegs,3,Fri Apr 3 14:10:06 2015 UTC,"There is only one way to lose weight - consume less than you burn. You can achieve this in various ways, but rules like this are obvious bullshit. If there really were some miracle to weight loss scientists would study the shit out of it and there would be data backing up claims."
IsItBullshit,31aar2,Nowhere_Man_Forever,2,Fri Apr 3 18:03:09 2015 UTC,Baffles me that people still don't grasp this.
IsItBullshit,31aar2,Hollyw0od,4,Sat Apr 4 00:48:18 2015 UTC,Bullshit. All you are going to do is fuck up your digestive cycle and it would suck.

IsItBullshit,31aar2,strained_brain,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:18:52 2015 UTC,"Like all fad diets it can work if you actually eat less calories, also like all fad diets it's bullshit because for weight loss it doesn't matter how exactly you do this"

IsItBullshit,31aar2,barbadosslim,1 point,Sat Apr 4 20:50:29 2015 UTC,In my experience most diets are bullshit. Iv tried quite a few and a dietitian told me that diets success depend entirely on the person and that these named diets are too easy to flog to the masses because they get one person who it worked for and show the before and after shots then everyone is sold on it. He said to me that the best way to find a diet that works for you is to take small groups of food and only eat those for a week and if you find yourself gaining weight then your body must be opposed to one of those foods. If you do not gain weight then add another small group of foods to your diet and rinse and repeat.
