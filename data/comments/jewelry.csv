jewelry,3e63iv,landogocus123,3,Wed Jul 22 06:19:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't think you will need to spend more than $100USD, and that is on the high end of the spectrum. A small silver pendant, especially one not set with any sort of gem stones should not be difficult to find. Beyond that, most jewelers offer engraving services. If you feel the jeweler is asking too much for the engraving, take the necklace elsewhere (independent engraving services for everything from knives to lighters to jewelry are only a google search away) and have the engraving done.  In terms of silver, I would be sure that what you buy is .925 sterling silver.  This means that the silver is 92.5% pure. The last ~8% is, well, sterling. The addition of sterling helps slow the oxidation process of the silver (pure silver must be polished regularly to remove the black ""tarnish"" that accumulates otherwise). Generally, .925 sterling silver is going to be your best bet, and is the most popular purity for some high end jewelers (Tiffany&Co come readily to mind).  I hope this is helpful"

jewelry,3e0nuh,baldylox,2,Tue Jul 21 03:43:40 2015 UTC,"Well good luck to you. It's not easy. Especially with jewelry. You get lost in a sea of 2 million others.   It takes time and money to build up the collection of tools and supplies that you'll want and need. Ya gotta have a bench. Fire is going to enter at some point.   Look into enameling and acid etching if you like copper. Find a local junkyard that sells scrap copper and #400 stainless. Both are good for enameling and etching.   Wire and all those supplies are a LOT cheaper online. Don't buy ear hooks at the craft store for $2 a pair when you can buy a gross of the same ones online for $10.  And most of all, have fun. ;-)"

jewelry,3e1chm,bobcat009,2,Tue Jul 21 05:04:54 2015 UTC,"This video is pretty good at showing the process of getting your solder to stick. Although its a silver ring the same process applies to other metals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qywC-xvghhY  Also, make sure the ring bands are super clean and free of any oils or residue before you begin the soldering process. If your solder doesn't melt on the first attempt, pickle your ring to clean it from any soot or dirtiness from the flame. Always use flux on the joint to help the solder flow easily, and make sure it is as flush as possible. As you expose your flame to the ring, continuously move it around the ring and avoid only focusing it on the joint. The key to getting your solder to melt is getting the entire object the same temperature. Hope these tips will help!"

If you have concerns, why not take it to the jeweller who made it and discuss those concerns, they can help you come up with solutions. If they're not being helpful, take it to a different jeweler.

jewelry,3e0gd6,iluvbobsmith,2,Tue Jul 21 14:47:39 2015 UTC,It is fixable.  I would look around for a local jeweler that does on site repairs. What you are looking for is to have them do a half shank repair.  They will remove the thin part of the bottom (shank) of your ring and completely rebuild it to at least 2mm generally depending on the thickness higher up in the ring.  I'm guessing the ring is 14k an average price for something like that could be around $300 but it will vary store to store.  Edit: If you have the option of sending it back and having them fix it that might be the way to go with the least cost

Cheap, stretchy stuff that WILL break.  Get someone who does beadwork to string it onto wire for you.    It looks like dyed turquoise beads compose most of the bracelet.  Then we have brown tiger's eye, then what I'm 100% sure is white howlite, and I'm unsure about the center pinkish bead.    Depending on the size of her wrists, it seems like the white howlite beads are about 8 mm in size.  Based off of that estimate, I'd guess that the brown tiger's eye beads are 6 mm, and the center bead could be 10 mm.  I bet the dyed turquoise beads are 4 mm, if I'm not mistaken.    I do beadwork myself.  I have a picture of some beads that are white howlite.  These are 8 mm in size.  I have not sold this jewelry yet, so if you'd like I can take a photo of the jewelry next to something for scale.

Personally, I wouldn't buy any stone with a certificate from any other lab. (In the USA)   Only expensive stones are sent to GIA to be certified, because it is expensive. So, what the GIA trained jeweler said is correct.   If the first stone is graded and appraised by a GIA trained gemologist, and the shop has a good rep, go with that.   If you want a stone that is certified, get it certified by the GIA. In the eyes of most buyers, anything else is a waste of money. GIA is the standard. I think you can still do this yourself. It is NOT an appraisal.   If you are unsure, you could also ask for a second, independent grading, and appraisal, from another GIA trained gemologist. But if the shop is family-owned, you see the training certificates, they are Graduate Gemologists, and the stone is beautiful, that's the way to go.  No reputable jeweler is going to screw you over. It isn't worth it."
jewelry,3d6nt6,superthankz4asking,2,Tue Jul 14 05:36:21 2015 UTC,"So, to that end, would you suggest buying a smaller stone (.6) with a GIA cert over a larger one (.7) without?"
jewelry,3d6nt6,omni_wisdumb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:57:41 2015 UTC,"Depends on the certification. Is it really from GIA, or is it just an appraisal by a GIA gemologist?  If I was a novice, I would go with the smaller stone. Jewelers don't send crappy stones to the GIA.   Any other lab? Go with the larger, uncertified stone, but ask for a retail ( not insurance) appraisal."

Taken directly from Opals Down Under's FAQs:   Synthetic solid opal can be very difficult to identify, unless you are an expert, or have a lot of experience. Look closely at the pattern - Opal created in a laboratory (Gilson opal), displays bright colours in large patches of colour. The pattern is often 'too perfect' and ordered, and can also often display a 'snakeskin' pattern. If you are still not sure, take it to a gemmologist or an opal expert.

jewelry,3d1epv,Snoodog,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:54:47 2015 UTC,Well the carat indicates that it's an alloy usually with silver zinc copper depending on the color of gold achieved. You can always get it laser tested at any gold council in your city.
jewelry,3d1epv,flyingfcuk13,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:55:31 2015 UTC,Yeah but there are infinite combinations of alloys and tempers. They should have pretty varied properties
jewelry,3d1epv,withahammer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:57:24 2015 UTC,"Most jewellers that make their own work buy their gold by karat, colour, and sometimes by temper, which typically falls into categories of ""hard, half hard, dead soft."" Unless specifically asked, most suppliers don't send along information on the exact percentages of the alloy. Temper can change depending on how the ring was made, such as being hammer forged, or cast.  I imagine if you're going to a commerical store and asking employees, they're not going to have a clue about anything besides the karat, as the work is mass produced elsewhere.  The only way you could tell is probably by refining it, which would defeat the point. Gold testers only show the karat. Nothing will tell you what the temper is, but as a general rule the higher in karat you go, the softer the ring will be as the percentage of fine gold is higher, and gold is a soft metal."

Here's a photo of my ring by itself, and another (bad camera) photo of it worn next to my wedding band.   It was bought from a jeweller on Etsy. This is the actual listing; however, I bought my stone separately and shipped it to him, which decreased the price, and I didn't get the matching wedding band. The cost for the ring itself without the center stone was about $370 to $380. You can also ask for a different stone and he will quote a price.  If you're curious: my ring has a 5mm moissanite stone in the center, surrounded by a tiny halo that I personally think is in perfect proportion. The halo is raised just high enough to allow another ring to fit flush against the band, but it's not a ""high profile"" ring at all. I've never had any issues with it catching on anything, and it doesn't stand up off my finger in a noticeable way. It's white gold, and the band is about 2mm wide as far as I can tell.

jewelry,3cddw7,chasing_round,3,Tue Jul 7 01:10:58 2015 UTC,"In my experience, there are a few possible factors that cause this.  Either your torch is not getting hot enough (hard silver solder should do this job fine, and melts/flows at 1370-1400 I think) or the surface is not clean (which you mentioned you had cleaned it).  I can't tell if that was the way you were soldering the ring from the picture, but make sure the two edges are flush and tight together.  If you are using a 3rd arm, set up the ring so the seam is at the bottom - solder likes to flow with gravity and toward heat.  The flux will ""flower"" like you describe - turn white, brown, then clear, adhering your solder to the surface.  Then, circle the hottest point of your flame around the ring, evenly heating the whole ring.  Again, if you're using a 3rd arm, hit the side where the ring is clamped a little more to ensure even heating as the arm will be a heat suck.  After the silver turns uniform in a darker color and you can tell it is about to turn red, hit the area around the seam.  Both sides should go bright red and the solder should flow!  Hope this helps!  Edited:  left out a word, wrong word, and duplicate text."
jewelry,3cddw7,catesatomicgarden,3,Tue Jul 7 01:32:51 2015 UTC,"Seconding this - it really helps if you have an almost perfect joint (can't see light through it when you hold it up).

Is the silver getting orange-hot at any point?"
jewelry,3cddw7,ShesGotSauce,2,Tue Jul 7 05:13:40 2015 UTC,Is your torch hot enough?   Can you switch to medium or easy solder?   If you're just closing the join you don't necessarily need hard solder.

jewelry,3cddw7,redthoughtful,2,Tue Jul 7 01:19:04 2015 UTC,The difference in solders is the amount of heat required to melt them. If you're just closing that one join (no additional joins/embellishments to solder onto the shank) I would use easy.

For a join like this, I prefer working on a flat surface (charcoal block or other similar heat friendly surface) and laying a small piece of solder down. Place the fluxed joint right on top of the solder. Heat the entire ring up and then focus on the area you want it to flow last, since heat travels to the coldest spot. When the solder flows, you'll see the ring ""drop"" as it melts up into the seam.   The metal clamp you are using is pulling heat away from the joint, this shouldn't be a big deal though. What kind of torch are you using?   Everyone who is saying use medium or even easy solder is right. Hard is going to look best and should flow for you, but for a single joint in heavier gauge wire, it's not necessary to use hard."
jewelry,3cddw7,munroegeek,2,Tue Jul 7 06:07:57 2015 UTC,"i made a similar mistake when i started the entire ring needs to be heated, i greatly misunderestimated this when starting. heat everything and then finally focus on the joint. silver wicks heat like crazy. if you can use a broader flame it may help get the ring up to temp where you can get a good flow.   hitting just the flux will give you all the ""right"" tells but it can be quite misleading."
jewelry,3cddw7,munroegeek,2,Tue Jul 7 14:47:42 2015 UTC,your clamp is also quite large sucking even more heat away... if you can set it up in tweezers you may see it work easier particularly if your using a small torch.
jewelry,3cddw7,JamesTiberiusChirp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:48:39 2015 UTC,"I want to reiterate everything /u/catesatomicgarden said, and add some additional advice. The hottest part of the torch flame is going to be the tip of the inner cone. What kind of torch are you using? If you are using a weak butane pencil torch and additionally not using the hottest part of your flame, you are going to have a hard time. It also helps to hold the flame perpendicular to the surface of the item you're heating. What are you using for flux? It doesn't look like it's getting hot enough, so I think heat is your issue. Another thing that will help is to make sure your solder is also clean -- just as with your ring, sand it lightly and wash it before adding.  I also want to emphasize what a couple others have mentioned: that gap is far too wide. Even if you were able to get your solder to flow, it's not going to solder that ring together. You need to file and sand the touching edges so they are perfectly flat and meet completely flush. You should be able to hold that baby up to a lightbulb and not see any light coming through the joint.  Good luck!"

jewelry,3cc0mf,babytwins,2,Tue Jul 7 02:45:11 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Gemcutter here. I can't help you with the ring itself but I just wanted to point out a few things about the topaz.  I don't generally recommend topaz for an engagement/wedding ring or other daily-wear rings unless the setting is highly protective. Topaz has what's called ""perfect cleavage"", which means that if you hit it against something in just the wrong way, it'll split cleanly into two pieces.  The next thing is that topaz has a lower refractive index (RI) than stones like sapphire or diamond, which means that for an equivalent size (in milimeters! carats measure weight), topaz needs to be cut deeper. That means that a properly cut topaz, when compared to a properly cut sapphire or garnet or diamond, will necessarily need to be set slightly higher up. Princess cuts need to be deeper in general, as part of their design.  Also...in the past few years, vendors have been deliberately mislabelling topaz. So-called ""London blue"" or ""Swiss blue"" topaz refers not just to a color, but a specific method of irradiation used to create those colors. Swiss-process blue topaz should be a Windex-y color, slightly electric looking and a bit lighter, while London-process topaz should be darker blue, a bit inkier, and usually with a hint of grey. Make sure that there's good communication between you, your SO, and the jeweller/gemcutter so that you get the color you want :)"

Lower kt gold tends to be harder/less likely to scratch, but higher kt is richer in color. For something this simple (ie no detail work), the kt might not matter so much.  Bezel settings are very protective, which makes them ideal for rings. The stone does stick up quite a bit over the bezel, though."

jewelry,3c1a0q,Ashl3yb33,3,Fri Jul 3 21:05:25 2015 UTC,"Body jewelry really isn't entirely comparable. The materials have to be implant grade ASTM F136/F138 implant grade titanium/steel, 14/18kt gold with acceptable alloys, or platinum. Additionally, machining the threaded ends is more expensive than, say, an earring post. High quality, implant grade jewelry isn't cheap, but it is SO worth it.   I'd look at Anatometal and BVLA to start. Most of my jewelry is solid gold, but I have a few with gems - my nape has 1 mm diamonds as a flower center, I think I paid about $130 a piece. If you go with CZ over genuine stones, you'll save a good bit.  CZ is actually really beautiful, and I honestly can't tell the difference between that and diamonds in my jewelry. Here is the diamonds, and this is my piece with CZ. Both sparkle beautifully!   I've got a few piercings currently- nipples, nape surface bar, 3x lobes, daith. So if you have any questions about nipple piercings feel free to ask!"

I was assuming it wouldn't cost me more than a few hundred bucks each to get some nice stones in there, mostly because of their size. There is that part of me that relishes the idea that I would have a tiny ruby or moissonite or diamond in a body piercing.   I have to admit, I am not entirely sure of the EXACT grade of steel or titanium that is used by this shop. I spoke to them on the phone today and asked a bunch of questions related to pricing and customization, and was assuming quality based on the amount of recommendations for this particular place and piercer.   I'm pretty confident I want the nipple piercings at some point, it also helps that I can change the jewelry myself so I have that comfort of shopping on my own time for those pieces. At the moment I'm trying to go between the two types because I can't afford getting all of them right now.   I'm checking out those brands right now and I'm blown away. The store I spoke to did say they would order any jewelry they don't have in store and with everything I'm seeing on here, I almost can't resist."

I totally understand wanting genuine gems - I'm currently saving for the marquise sarai end with ruby from BVLA, and I definitely want a tiny diamond when I get my nostril done. You're right, assuming you want something only a few mm it shouldn't be more than a few hundred.   Can I ask which shop you're in contact with? I can check their site/portfolio or ask my piercer if they're familiar. Additionally, you can do a quick search at safepiercing.org and see if the shop pops up there or if something else near you does. Unfortunately price is not always an indicator of quality."

Mostly recommendations led me here and I'm just starting to ask more questions before I go in and meet the piercer in person.   Finding a balance between a professional piercer and some genuinely solid materials is worth spending the time on :)"

jewelry,3byclp,cowsruleusall,3,Sat Jul 4 02:48:06 2015 UTC,"Hey there OP, gemcutter here.  Emerald cuts are... very hit or miss, with a lot more miss. They're supposed to be used for two highly specific reasons - either to maximize the yield on a very long, narrow gemstone, or to highlight exceptional clarity in a gemstone that normally has a lot of inclusions. They are also infrequently used in dark materials to give them ""flash"", which allows the actual color to come through much more than any brilliant cut.  The downside to this is that pretty much all gems (other than tourmaline, beryl, and danburite) that are factory-cut in an emerald cut will be comparatively poor stones. They almost always have giant windows (dead areas where you can see someone's finger through the stone), and are usually cut far too shallow, eliminating appropriate flash and color. You'll see a lot of chipping along the keel (think boats), and asymmetric corners, along with shitty polish quality on the entire stone other than the table (top flat part).  Custom, precision-cut gems in an emerald cut will be significantly better, but even then, they aren't ideal just because of the style of emerald cuts. Now, an important question. Does your GF just want the outline to look like an emerald cut (meaning a rectangle with the corners cut off), or does she very specifically want something that's cut in a stepwise fashion, with no significant brilliance or interesting reflection pattern, and just kinda winks at you when it's tilted?  There are thousands of gem designs out there. I've published maybe 250+ myself. You could find plenty of gems with that particular outline, some with and some without traditional features of an emerald cut. Getting a better idea of what your GF is looking for would help me suggest something for you.  IIRC, Jeff Hapeman over at ""Earth's Treasury"" just put up an awesome emerald-cut sapphire, unheated, untreated, and a royal blue color.  Oh, and as for sapphires? Most sapphires are heated, in order to improve clarity and color, but this isn't disclosed nearly as often as it should be. Make sure you know if yours is heated or unheated. Also, if synthetics are an option for you, /u/flameswithin is a friend of mine who does excellent work with synthetic sapphires."
jewelry,3byclp,cowsruleusall,2,Fri Jul 3 16:51:57 2015 UTC,"/u/cowsruleusall  I was hoping you would respond to this. You've helped out alot of folks in this sub. Thanks for all you do here!  Talked to GF, she wants the type that winks at you when it's tilted. I was trying to push something with a brilliant cut, but she says she wants something that looks simple and sophisticated. I tried to push something with a little more shine and bling, but she didn't budge.  I am open to something lab created and have looked at /u/flameswithin site. Great stuff. Do you know if he does custom order sapphires? Or is it just whatever he has on hand? Sorry, like I said, total newb. This is the first and last time I ever want to do this.  Also, any suggestions for non lab created sapphires?  Once again, thank you, as well as the others who help news like me!"
jewelry,3byclp,cowsruleusall,2,Fri Jul 3 22:26:39 2015 UTC,"Hey! :D  No worries about the ""sophisticated simplicity"" idea. Shiny bling isn't always the most awesome answer, and although I have a personal dislike for traditional emerald cuts some people think they're amazing, and that's okay!  Was your budget $1k-$1.5k for the stone on its own, or for the ring as a whole?  Also, yes, Phil (/u/flameswithin) does custom orders. I know he's got a bit of a backlog and has taken longer than normal to get back to some of the Redditors I've sent his way, but he's my preferred option for synthetic spinels, sapphires, and moissanites.  The one problem I can forsee is that normally, synthetic sapphire comes as a semicylinder, with the blue color concentrated at the periphery of the piece. To do an emerald cut, you'd have to sacrifice a lot more of the boule than you'd normally do, so he might not be the happiest about it. On the other hand, a synthetic spinel has even color all the way throughout, and cobalt spinel (ask Phil about Djeva #114!) has the most intense, awesome blue color imaginable.  As for natural, check this one out. If I were buying a natural blue sapphire in an emerald cut, this 1.17ct Nigerian sapphireis exactly what I would get. Jeff (the owner/cutter) is a friend of mine, so I'm a bit biased, but still. If you'd prefer something that's a bit of a shorter rectangle, I haven't seen any on anyone's sites that I've particularly liked, but check out the following cutters and see if you like anything: Lisa Elser, Gene Flannigan, Jeff White, Jordan Wilkins, Peter Torraca.  Any other questions, let me know!"

I did reach out to /u/flameswithin and waiting for a response.  The nigerian sapphire is a little to long rectangle. But it's def the color I am looking for.  Question, are there any natural sapphire stores you recommend.  I'm torn between getting a natural one vs a lab created one. Mostly because the price difference is huge but the look is the same. Seems like the price difference is in the ""knowing"" of how it was made.  Def would love to hear your thoughts."

jewelry,3bt5qv,trolltollboy,11,Wed Jul 1 22:59:39 2015 UTC,"Hey there OP, gem cutter here! (Temporarily not cutting gems, sorry...) Hopefully I can answer all your questions.  When you're buying a gemstone for daily-wear use, like an engagement or wedding ring, the first and most important thing is hardness. Only gems that are Mohs 8 or harder should be used, and stones with perfect cleavage should be avoided. This limits you to the following materials: spinel (8)(natural or synthetic), yttrium-aluminum garnet (8.5)(synthetic only), cubic zirconia (8.25)(synthetic only), chrysoberyl (8.5)(natural only), alexandrite (8.5)(natural or synthetic), sapphire/ruby (9)(natural or synthetic), and moissanite (9.5)(synthetic only).  Brittleness is also important for reasons of wear and tear. We also consider the refractive index (RI, which correlates to maximum possible brilliance, and ranges from 1.43 to 2.92) and the index of dispersion (""fire"", the amount of multicolored flash you see, which ranges from 0.000 to 0.312), since these have a HUGE impact on how the stones look, and of course, the specific cut used on the stone is a MASSIVE MASSIVE easily underestimated factor, responsible for the vast majority of the stone's appearance.  For reference, diamond has a hardness of 10, RI of 2.42, and dispersion of 0.044.  Now let's talk about those materials. Yttrium-aluminum garnet (YAG) and cubic zirconia (CZ) are materials not found in nature. CZ comes in virtually any color imaginable, as well as some types that actually change color significantly depending on the lighting. I have a piece of CZ that's green in daylight and purple in artificial light. It's slightly more brittle than YAG, but far more available. The RI is fairly high at 2.16, close to diamond, and the dispersion is 0.057, a touch above diamond, so if it's well cut it'll be sparkly, brilliant, and have good flash. YAG, on the other hand, is a material used for lasers and high-end scientific equipment, and can also be used in gems. This comes in a limited number of very interesting colors - there's a lavender-to-blue color change, an intense canary yellow, a forest green, and rarely found are rich red and royal blue. YAG is more resilient than CZ beacuse it's slightly harder and significantly less brittle, but the RI is lower (1.83) and the dispersion is a bit lower as well (.028). Moissanite is absolutely ridiculously brilliant and fiery (RI is 2.62, dispersion is 0.104), more than twice as fiery as diamond, and it's incredibly resistant to wear and tear, but until the patents expire in August I wouldn't buy it - the price should drop significantly after that, and you'll see the range of cutting quality significantly increase.  Sapphires/rubies (which are different varieties of the same material, just like amethyst and citrine) and spinels are basically equivalent except for their rates of wear, which sapphire wins at. There are plenty of locations at which these are ethically and sustainably mined (Montana sapphires are the best example), and they come in a ridiculous range of colors, almost everything imaginable. Sapphire is dichroic, meaning that if you look at the stone from two different directions it'll have two different colors. Spinel does not have this feature. A strongly dichroic sapphire, if cut well, can eliminate an unpleasant color OR show two different pleasant colors at the same time. A key point to watch out for is treatment. Most sapphires are heated, which can lighten excess darkness, change white sapphires to blue sapphires, and make them appear clearer. This should always be disclosed, but in many cases is not. Sapphires can also be diffused with beryllium, giving them a strong yellow or orange color - this should also be disclosed, but frequently isn't, and most of the older-generation Be-diffused sapphires will lose their color if you ever need to have them repolished or repaired. Most lower-end rubies are filled with a molten lead-glass product to reduce the appearance of cracks, and this significantly weakens the stone to both wear/tear and to even weak acids (avoid these bullshit ""stones"" at all cost!). Some pure blue spinels are also diffused with cobalt - none of the diffused stones have ever been disclosed before sale, as this is a brand new treatment designed specifically to circumvent testing and legal standards.  Rubies, sapphires, and spinels are also available in ""flame-fusion"" and ""Czochralski pulled"" man-made crystals. They are chemically identical to the natural thing, but are flawless and inexpensive, and can come in a much, MUCH wider range of colors. /u/flameswithin happens to be an expert cutter of synthetic sapphire and spinel, although he's very busy and it's best to contact him from his Etsy store.  Alexandrite is a very special color-changing variety of chrysoberyl. Chrysoberyl is only really found naturally, and comes in yellow, green, minty, or champagne or root-beer colors. Alexandrite, when high quality, is a berry-red or bluish-green color in different lighting conditions, but is inordinately expensive even in its synthetic version (the synthetic is used in military lasers).  Now...cutting quality. This is HUGE HUGE HUGE. Whenever I show people why cutting quality is so important, I show them the difference between the standard ""factory cut"" stones, and a well-done precision-cut stone. Cutting factories, and even a lot of the older higher-end European cutters, cut gems not to optimize their color or brilliance or fire, but to save the maximum amount of weight physically possible. This is because gems were traditionally sold by carat weight. However...this leads to a lot of unethical practices. Gems can be cut with ""bellies"", which are a way to pack on extra weight, or they can be cut wide and shallow, a technique to make a stone look larger than it actually should have been if it was cut well. In both of these cases, the brilliance and color will be significantly worse than if they were cut well, and these stones frequently show ""extinction"" (black areas) and ""windows"" (dead areas where you can see someone's finger straight through the stone). I'd suggest you Google ""precision cut vs factory cut"" or some variation on that theme, so you can see how significant the difference is. I think John Dyer has a good comparison.  Your best bet for the ideal ring is to use a modern precision cut. The best current resources for that would be at the Gemology Project, a forum and information site for gemcutters and gem collectors. This link should take you to a page where you can see some incredible modern designs. If you're looking for a specific person to buy a stone from, there are many of us on Reddit who are precision gemcutters, certified by the US Faceters Guild. I think /u/bobsiv, /u/Turkinolith /u/flameswithin, /u/GreenStrong, myself, and a few others...  If you want someone with a fancy storefront or website, try Lisa Elser, Peter Torraca, Phil Lagas-Rivera (/u/flameswithin), Jeff Hapeman, Gene Flannigan, Jeff White, Jean-Noel Soni, Dalan Hargrave, and oh god so many other people that I know personally or professionally that do work that's leaps and bounds ahead of virtually everything you'll ever seen in a chain store or even a mom-and-pop jeweller.  Let me know if I can give you any more info, or help you out at all! I'd offer to cut you something but I've got boards for med school and I'm cramming my brains out."
jewelry,3bt5qv,cowsruleusall,3,Wed Jul 1 23:52:02 2015 UTC,"If you live by most large cities (NYC, LA, boston) there will be a jewelry district. They can be a little overwhelming, but often have the best prices. I also like brilliant earth http://www.brilliantearth.com/colored-gemstones/.   If you're choosing between non-diamond stones, make sure you check out their hardness. Diamonds are a 10 on the Mohs scale, which is awesome. They don't scratch, which is one reason they're good for rings which take a LOT of abuse. Sapphires/rubies are a 9, which is pretty darn good too. The softer the stone, the more likely it is to be damaged in a ring which is presumable worn all the time. Stones like pearls or opals, for example, are a poor choice for rings.   The jeweler you get your ring for will be able to set the stone for you. I would recommend finding the stone first, and then finding/commissioning your ring, since the size and shape of the stone will influence the overall design of the ring.   Something else to consider which tends to get overlooked is the actual type of setting. Personally, I think prong settings are a terrible choice for rings, especially an every-day. The prongs can catch on fabrics, scratch things and can be pulled apart, letting the stone fall out. Look into bezel settings- they're super secure, clean looking and easy to wear.   Hope that helps you get started!"
jewelry,3bt5qv,Lovelyfeathereddinos,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:14:19 2015 UTC,thank you. I dont live next to a large city. I was looking into a gemselect.com . I wasnt sure if that is a good option to go with. I have been checking out the mohs on stones and sapphires / ruby tend to be close to diamonds. And I was looking into those. It is still intimidating considering I am unsure on what I am getting. My total budget is 3000.
jewelry,3bt5qv,forwardseat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:25:12 2015 UTC,"For an engagement ring, I'd look at some different vendors. Gemselect is ok and has some nice stuff, but I'd look for something better quality.     Gemfix.com, earth's treasury, precisiongem.com,  etc.  The colored stones forum at pricescope.com has a sticky thread of recommended vendors, which is a great place to start (along with the recommendations of cowsruleusall)    (I second the mention of montana sapphires, I have one and I love it)"

jewelry,3bmj6u,eddytheflow,3,Tue Jun 30 12:42:12 2015 UTC,"Any ring can be custom made. I do custom jobs for a variety of different types of jewelry. As long as there is enough description or a picture to work from it can be made. Find a jeweler in which you are involved in the process though. Several people have gone to a jeweler that said they could do it for them and it came out nothing like was expected. This is a costly process and you don't want that to happen. The process my company uses is typically a cad/cam process in which you get to see a graphical representation before the ring is casted. You can make any changes at that point including changing stone size, filigree patterns, shank width or anything else. After you approve that we receive in an alloy replica of what the ring will look like. You get to actually see what the ring will look like before it is completed. Once you say its what you want it is then casted so there is no chance you don't get what you want.   Make sure you also have some knowledge of quality of stones as well. Stones can come in a variety of colors depending on the clarity grade of the stones. For instance, blue sapphires at a lower grade can look almost black or navy blue while a higher grade will look deep royal blue. Ceylon sapphires are absolutely beautiful but can run you a pretty penny.   Good luck!"

This would bring the overall measurement of the design to approximately 7mm.  It would require about 3 pennyweights of gold. If you were to do this through my company there is a flat fee which covers the jewelers time, skill, labor and materials to craft the mold needed to cast the piece. Then you just pay for the materials needed.  Fee: 600 14k gold: approx. 560 Dia: approx. 300 .75mm sapphires: approx. 380 Center sapphire: c quality approx. 100 - AAA quality approx. 500  Total: 1800-2500 depending on what you choose for a center stone."

jewelry,3bk5al,PhotogenicNudist,-1,Tue Jun 30 02:39:25 2015 UTC,A hybrid diamond is 95% lab grown diamond around a core of synthetic material. So it is molecularly the same as a mined diamond except for a small amount in the center of the stone. They are colorless unlike moissanite which is a synthetic polymer and closer to a cz than a real diamond. Hybrid diamonds have been around for at least 20 years so I'm not sure why you haven't heard of them. They are cheaper than a moissanite which is sold at huge markup considering its a piece of plastic that will yellow over time. Your pretty much paying for a brand with moissanite and it doesn't even look half as good as a hybrid.

Also I have nothing against moissanite or anyone having one in their engagement ring. My only argument is that there are cheaper options if you are looking for something that looks the most like a natural diamond.

jewelry,3bhl5v,jenesaisquoi,5,Mon Jun 29 07:46:28 2015 UTC,"As for the metal, the big drawback to using silver is durability.  The ring is traditionally worn every day for a lifetime, and that's the bigger reason that people use gold or platinum and such, it holds up much better to long term wear.  Since mining is destructive and that's important to them, I would look to find someone who can make a ring from recycled metals.  There are several such vendors on etsy, but if they ask around at local non-chain jewelers in their area they may find someone who can do this for them pretty easily.  Stone - there are several options in the colors she likes, but you can't 100% guarantee the ethics and mining conditions (both for workers and the environment) unless you see every part of the process.  About the best I can suggest is a sapphire from montana.  Sapphire is durable enough for everyday wear, and comes in purple and pink, though those colors aren't as common in the montana variety (they tend to be greyish-blue, or greenish-blue, or greenish-yellow).  But for a stone durable for daily wear, this is probably your best bet for something that's also natural.  I have a montana sapphire, purchased from Mountain Momma Gems on etsy.  It's worth sending her an email.  It's also worth contacting /u/flameswithin on here, I know he's had pink montana sapphires on his etsy shop.    Alternately, you can probably get much closer to the ideal color by getting a synthetic sapphire or spinel (or a pink moissanite).  You can also generally get a bigger stone for less money this way.  Only drawback ethically is that the raw materials used to create these are still coming from mining... nothing is 100% without effect on the earth and its people.  The same user I mentioned above has cut some lovely synthetic gems, so it's worth asking about that as well (he also does some neat modern precision cutting, so your friend could be totally involved in creating something genuinely unique).

Commercial quality stones seem to be traded in large quantities and commingled along the way, and many mines are environmentally suspect, using child labor, and/or dangerous for those doing the mining (those things are not always true, but even ""conflict free"" gemstones might come from less than savory sources).  Curious about the process gemvara uses in this regard..."
jewelry,3bhl5v,cowsruleusall,0,Mon Jun 29 18:28:00 2015 UTC,"That's a great question! You are right that it is extremely difficult to be 100% sure that a gemstone is ethically sourced, but as a company we only work with suppliers that we trust. We do everything we can to be as sure as possible that we are using conflict free gemstones and diamonds. All of our diamonds come with Kimberly Process Warrants, confirming they are conflict free. In addition, we are members of the AGTA. (American Gemstone Trade Association) They are a non profit organization whose sole purpose is to ensure that gemstones are represented ethically. Regarding proof of origin, that would come from a third party certificate like GIA or IGI, which we can provide upon request. I hope this helps! I am happy to elaborate or answer any other questions you have. :-)"

Thank you for the suggestion!"
jewelry,3bb69g,lovelyleffler,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:39:50 2015 UTC,"Lets see. If I wear sterling silver longer than a day, I get a red, raised, itchy rash and the part of the silver that touches me will turn a weird color not easily removed. Jeweler told me he's seen it before, very ho-hum, and suggested I paint the inside of the ring in question with clear nail polish. Seems to work just fine. He said I was probably allergic to nickel.  When I later got my first got my ears pierced, my grandparents bought me a pair of 18kt gold studs. The studs in question were a pair of ladybugs with the part against the ear on the bottom side of the ladybug being just a flat disc shape. Over a couple of weeks my ears got sore. My grandma looked at me one morning and asked why my ear lobes were swollen and red. When removed the portion against my ear holes / actually inside it was sort of eaten up and it took a few days for my ears to heal up.  From that point on, I had difficulty with earrings, especially the cheap metal sort. Those cheap plastic earrings made of nylon didn't seem to bother. There was a line for sensitive ears made with surgical steel posts sold by big box discount stores which were really bad for me. Guessing cheap grade of surgical steel maybe?   Even with the better surgical steel, I can only wear them for a day and must take them out overnight. Tried painting the gold earrings with clear nail polish and it seemed to just get them to a point I could again wear them for a day and remove.   If I get tired and leave earrings in overnight, my ear lobes will be slightly reddened in the morning. There will be swelling around the edge of the holes in my ears. If it goes 48 hours, I have a clear fluid that dries yellow that comes out of the holes in my lobes which I assume is puss. No matter how much I clean with alcohol, or that no more sore ears stuff that I think is just a scented alcohol maybe, 48 hours and there's that clear liquid, pain, swelling, and redness.  My spouse bought me a pair of platinum diamond studs. Found I can wear them forever with no issues. My mother can't wear gold or silver and says if she tries her skin weeps and the weepage eats the metal. She also has no trouble with platinum. I finally lost one of my platinum studs and now I just don't care. I quit wearing earrings for the most part, though on rare formal occasions I probably will put something in. Just seems more finished and posh than sporting ear lobes with empty holes.  I would suggest you select a variety of items, list what they're made of, and then wear them. Write down what happens and see which bother and which don't. Platinum according to several jewelers is not commonly a problem, but sterling silver and even some gold is. I've been told purer gold is much more rarely an issue, but it gets softer the purer it gets, so problematic. As far as coatings, I've been told by a few jewelers there is some sort of plastic dip for sterling silver but it wears off over time similar to clear nail polish and is much more expensive."

As for trusting Tacori, I understand your suspicion, but Tacori is a very reputable company, and they're not about to risk that so they can make $1k by swapping your stone for a cheaper one. Their reputation is worth FAR more than $1,000. Besides, if they're really out to get you, what's to stop them from inscribing another stone with the same number, or some other nefarious plot?  Honestly, as someone who works in the interest, it's really frustrating that a few bad apples out there have made the public distrust all of us. I would never even CONSIDER swapping a customer's stone, and neither would the people I work with. On the contrary, I often draw a plot of diamonds before I take them in, and make the customer sign it, so I can prove to THEM that I didn't switch it. And I hate that this situation exists. When you work with ""your jeweler,"" it should be like working with ""your doctor"" or ""your lawyer,"" not ""your car salesman."" We're not here to screw you! We are professionals, who are here to help you!  So, my best advice is that if you don't trust Tacori, you shouldn't send them your stone at all. And if you do trust them, then TRUST them."

What concerns me is an employee who will handle the diamond. People are very swifty and it concerns me. Do you think any employee of any jeweler has ever stolen a diamond from their employer and got away with it?  I do. Although very unlikely, it just makes me nervous. It was my grandma's stone and is irreplaceable. Don't use car sales man and jeweler in the same sentence. No comparison. I just don't trust people in general and rightfully so."

After a lot of back and forth I ended up doing it. Now very good cut, H or I but 1.5c. Is that normal? Losing that much during the recut to maximize the brilliance? Thought we would lose 20-25% but ended up losing 33%. I know I couldn't have set it as is stood in a tacori halo but I hope I made the right decision. I was told ballpark value was 10k before and ballpark value is 18k now but I find that hard to believe. When I look up similar stones online they range from 8-10k. Was it worth more before?"

Maybe your stone was a particularly poor cut before, which would explain both its dull appearance and the high loss to correct the cut."

jewelry,3aspwe,leafjerky,10,Tue Jun 23 05:08:54 2015 UTC,"Well.  Nice rendering. Nicely done. Beautiful.   However. Where to begin?  What is the stone? The edges are so exposed that damage is almost assured. Cleavage planes, even in a diamond, can cause stones to fracture. Girdle chipping is an issue.  If the stone is a diamond, the proportions are off, unless you want no sparkle.if it is another gem, it is still a difficult cut for the vast majority of stones.   If the stone is not a diamond, the flat table will be subject to scratches.  Just my opinion. I am sure others will come and tell you different things, but, as a gemcutter, jewelry maker, but most of all a wearer, these would be my concerns.  Good luck."

Have you tried tapering it so the sides and bottom are thinner than the top?

You need to find a professional that you trust, that has credentials.  A professional in my field will ask the questions that matter.  What does she do for a profession?  What are her hobbies?

jewelry,3anyd9,amuhl10,2,Mon Jun 22 01:54:09 2015 UTC,"I remember when gold prices were peaking and palladium was going to be the next big thing since the market price of the raw palladium was about a third of what gold was. But it didn't happen basically because of this issue and the fact that it presents greater repair and manufacturing challenges for the average bench jeweler. It is a denser metal than gold and very resistant to wear. But it is a relatively malleable metal. I have no trouble believing that you bent it without noticing when it happened, probably grabbing the ladder getting out of the pool, chlorine exposure is not the issue. I've seen the same thing happen with some platinum alloys which are in the same family of metals with similar density and melting temperatures. The rule of thumb that I work with is that a ring made in Pd needs to be 2-3 times thicker than a comparable design in gold. I really do hate to be the bearer of bad news but there is no way permanently fix this ring, especially since every one of those drill holes the diamonds are set in further weaken an already too thin shank."
jewelry,3anyd9,hammershiller,3,Mon Jun 22 19:34:32 2015 UTC,"Perfectly put!   Customers who do research online and understandably come to the conclusion that Palladium is a good option.   Very white,  strong and cheaper than platinum.. Seems like a win win.   But even though it's a member of the platinum family it works nothing like Platinum.     There is a reason you don't see many manufactures using it even though it seems like it should take over the industry with white metal so popular.    I've seen brand new rings with broken claws on a center stone and once it's broken you just can't weld it back together with any strength.  Once something happens to it it's basically ruined forever.    I feel like the bearer of bad news every day at my job because of stuff like this.   There is just so much in the retail jewellery industry that is only meant to look good long enough for the customer to pay for the ring and walk out the door,  little to no consideration for long term wear.  And nothing gets more wear than engagement rings/ wedding sets.    I just hope somebody doing research on Reddit first might find this."

jewelry,3anyd9,eoot,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:06:34 2015 UTC,"This is pretty common and is easier to do than you might think.   It is usually an easy fix with  gold and silver,  Palladium might be a little tricky.   Depending on how bad it's bent parts of the shank may crack when it's straightened out.  Our shop hasn't worked with it often but those times were a real pain.   It was brittle and cracked easily and very tricky to solder the cracked joints.    It can cause stones to come loose as well so make sure to take it to a good goldsmith and get it checked over.   The most common cause is just from the strength of your hand.  It can bend when you grip something tight and you won't even notice.  It can also distort from hitting something as well but that's easier to notice.   I've seen that and claws bent,  stones chipped and missing but lots of customers say don't remember anything out of the ordinary with their ring.     Some of the trendy styles today can be quite thin (too thin IMHO) and the thinner and the design of the ring the more susceptible to bending and other damage it can be.   Hopefully it's not that because you could have lots of problems with it over time.    Pictures would help for sure."

jewelry,3ao3e2,omni_wisdumb,2,Mon Jun 22 03:28:14 2015 UTC,"Budget: less than $1250, preferably under 1k.  I'd like a relatively simple, small, and low set design, using a silver metal (white gold or platinum probably).  She's a size 4.5 so I'm aiming for a <0.75 carat, round cut stone.  I'd like for it to be a single center stone with 2-3, much smaller ones on either side (like in the link below).  I'd like the side detail/filigree to stretch 1/2 or 3/4 of the way around and be either art deco or floral in style, and not too busy (so not too many tiny lines or beading). I'd also like the general shape to be tapered so that the upper shank meets the stone smoothly but is neither too thick as it meets the stone, nor too thin around the lower shank.  I'm also leaning towards moissanite for its affordability and fire.  This is the closest thing I've found online to what I'm looking for.  Things that I would change about the design in the link:  -I'd like the size of the side diamonds to decrease slightly in size along with the taper.  -I'd like the mount to be a little more stylized, so change the slits and squareness of the mount (as seen in the 3rd photo) to something more like my quick sketch. It doesn't need to be exactly that, but I like that it's more open, detailed, and smooth.  -I might want a 6 prong mount"

If you're doing lots of small wax and mold making stuff it wouldn't be power that would hold you back but the tiny travel in the router. From what I understand about the machines in that range even the models with the most accurate carriage movement have huge detail difficulty because of the router itself. I guess it depends on what you're doing as well. If your projects are reasonable big and uncomplicated and you don't mind a lot of clean up I think they would have use to you. If it's more 3d than it is 1.5d I would be cautious. The same range you wrote was my initial starting point, it kinda sucks that to have a dedicated spindle it's like a grand more.

jewelry,3aesen,Miss_Awesomist,3,Fri Jun 19 15:17:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you're singling out rose gold and palladium, but most platinum, yellow gold, and white gold will all be durable. Platinum a little more so. White gold is naturally a softer shade, so it's often plated with rhodium to make it shiny, but otherwise, it's fine.   If you want colored gems, make sure you go with a jeweler who knows how to work with them, as they difficult to set if you're used to diamonds. In terms of durable gemstones, you want ruby/sapphires (comes in most colors), spinel (comes in most colors), chrysoberyl (yellow green), alexandrite (color change, expensive and hard to find in good quality).   I don't know what your budget is, but for your ring, I'd look at Yvonne Raley and Julia N on Etsy. For his, I've seen Scott Schrieber of Two Claws make awesome engraving."

Do you happen to know any other etsy shops like Raley's? I've found scattered around etsy beautiful pieces here and there, but since right now he's broke, they're most likely gone by the time he's ready to buy. I think the budget is around 2k maybe 2.5?  Oh and I singled out rose gold because I like the color and palladium because it's cheaper than Pt"

jewelry,3aesen,notable_bro,2,Fri Jun 19 19:47:46 2015 UTC,"For your ring, if you'd like to use palladium and rose gold, I'd pick out something either blue or red. Blue will be a complementary color and looks great in rose gold (sapphire), a deep or bright red would make it pop (spinel/ruby/parapridasha sapphire). I would make sure that the head isn't TOO large, as you want to wear this everyday. However, you might need to build something custom to both accommodate your taste and keep it manageable for your lifestyle. I would use many small stones instead of larger ones to keep the height down.  For guys, I find that wide and simpler is always better. A simple comfort fit band with a pattern will do wonders, just make sure it has a pattern he likes. Even something as simple as texturing, like sandblasting or a satin finish can change the feeling of a ring.  As for the black on that signet, it's very likely a jewelers enamel. It can come out, but it can also be put back in. It could probably be made without it entirely as well.  My idea is to have a head layout that you like that can be modified into a repeating pattern on this band. bad example here"

jewelry,3aaepq,youngandstarving,4,Thu Jun 18 14:32:09 2015 UTC,"the difference in one size of a ring is usually about a 2mm sliver. it isn't actually worth it, to have it saved."
jewelry,3aaepq,lionbear,3,Thu Jun 18 15:31:33 2015 UTC,Generally there is 2 reasons.  1 for the small amount of sizing being done the amount of gold you would get back would be negligible to nonexistent.   2 This varies store to store but at ours the gold that is kept is figured into the price of down sizing the ring thus the gold is part of your payment for the sizing.  This being said if/when our customers ask for it back we just go ahead and do it for them.  This is not an often request though.  Edit: If they can't even explain why and adamantly fight you over it I would look around for another Jeweler.
jewelry,3aaepq,Descent,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:10:33 2015 UTC,"Standard procedure is to figure scrap value into the price of resizing. So unless we're offering you a REALLY good price on a resizing, we keep it unless you ask.  One question, though, is why would you want it? A piece of 14K gold at 2mm x 1.4mm x 1.5mm is probably less than $5-10 in value.  I would NOT get the ring resized from anyone who says that they can't resize up and fight you on simple requests like this, though. (Unless the ring is something unusual, like mokume gane, 22K gold, or Argentium silver - and they're just saying they can't match it.) That's a bit shady."
jewelry,3aaepq,notable_bro,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:24:03 2015 UTC,"I don't want it for the value of it, I want it so it can be added to the inside of my ring to make it fit me better because it will still be too big even after being sized down."
jewelry,3aaepq,BearSkull,5,Thu Jun 18 18:57:37 2015 UTC,"Go to a different jeweler, it sounds like these people don't know what they're doing. Unless your ring is very thick or has some unusual settings if they can size it to a 5.5 it can be sized to a 5. Tightening any stones that my become loose in the process is part of the job."

jewelry,3aaepq,LeGrandMuzzy,2,Thu Jun 18 21:56:01 2015 UTC,"What I would recommend is to have two balls of solder placed at 5 and 7 o clock on the inside of the ring. They will hold it in place and keep it from moving around on your hand, as I'm guessing that you're having issues with it being a little loose after going over your knuckle."

jewelry,3a6611,DrIcyHands,4,Wed Jun 17 15:16:10 2015 UTC,"Silver is a soft metal that will wear down quickly when worn every day like engagement rings often are. Because of this, it isn't really a trusted metal to set an expensive stone like a diamond in. White gold or platinum are both silver metals better suited for the situation."
jewelry,3a6611,JamesTiberiusChirp,5,Wed Jun 17 15:23:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is uncommon.  A 1ct diamond is expensive enough to make the cost of the metal insignificant, and silver is a softer metal than white gold.  Because of the softness of silver, the setting would have to be rather sturdy and thick, or run a risk of losing an expensive stone.  A bench jeweler could make this, but the skilled labor would erase most of the cost savings compared to a more standard setting in white gold."
jewelry,3a6611,GreenStrong,2,Wed Jun 17 15:29:49 2015 UTC,"you should be able to get one custom made, no problem from a local jeweler. Just be sure to not have the setting for the stone itself made from .925 or fine silver, it wont hold up. maybe use white gold or something. a thicker shank would be needed or you should just be aware that with daily wear it will probably require regular reshanking."
jewelry,3a6611,begaterpillar,2,Wed Jun 17 15:24:40 2015 UTC,"To be honest, yes. It is possible. I don't recommend it for the reasons below.  If you really can't afford the gold, you can do silver. It would have to be custom made. I would make it with a 14K white gold head for strength. Because a custom silver band with a stone setting would cost ~$100-$150, I would try and stick the stone in value no more than $600-700. Which means the quality of the stone would suffer drastically. I have an example in my shop with a .33ct stone in a silver band for $500, but it looks like a piece of heavily included Quartz.  To be honest, a real diamond with a decent quality at a full carat is going to run you a couple grand. The band itself, if you use a thin and plain one in 14K might be as little as $400 of the price of the ring.  If anything, go with real gold and a smaller/different stone. It'll make all the difference in the world."

Honestly if she's going to be wearing it for the rest of her life, you want something durable. That said, I know that Tiffany sets tiny diamonds in silver, for some of their more casual pieces. If you're on a tight budget, maybe get something used from Idonowidon't.com. Used hearts on fire is usually a safe bet in terms of stone quality."
jewelry,3a3lfd,Petit_Hibou,3,Tue Jun 16 23:27:14 2015 UTC,"Best bang for your buck are spinels or ""berry"" sapphires. They'll have that color you like, they're durable to everyday wear, and they have great refractive indexes, so they'll sparkle. If you want a larger stone with more sparkle, go spinel. If you want a smaller, slightly more durable stone, go sapphire.   For the most sparkle, use a prong setting, and for durability, use 6-8 prongs, or a split 4 prong setting. That way if they start to bend or wear, you'll see it before it needs vital repair.  As for your fingers, you're going to want as close to a comfort fit band as possible. It's rounded on both the inside and the outside, and it should feel a little bit tight. You might also want to make sure the ring doesn't move around in some way, solitaires are pretty top heavy."
jewelry,3a3lfd,notable_bro,3,Wed Jun 17 02:00:17 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Gem cutter here.  Spinels are closely related to sapphires, and for most of history spinels and sapphires were very easily confused between the two. They have similar refractive indices (think of this as ""maximum brilliance"") and hardness (8 for spinel, 9 for sapphire), and both of them come in a ridiculously wide range of colors. Fine spinels are a bit less known because of their historical confusion for sapphires - in fact, many of the ""sapphires"" in royal jewellery collections are actually spinels!  As for color in all light, spinels that have purple tones to them are colored by zinc impurities, and these are unfortunately are very lighting-sensitive. Outdoor lighting makes them look amazing, while certain colors of fluorescent lighting makes them dead. Sapphires don't generally have this problem unless they're very intensely blue."
jewelry,3a3lfd,cowsruleusall,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:41:48 2015 UTC,"Hm, that's too bad about fluorescent lighting, since I spend at least 40 hours a week in the office!  I've been looking at sapphires as well, but hadn't found the perfect color yet, so I switched to looking at spinels.  Thanks for your input."
jewelry,3a3lfd,bugabob,3,Wed Jun 17 16:49:39 2015 UTC,"I think you'd be disappointed in that spinel, although the price seems very reasonable.  I suspect it will be darker and more gray than the photos show it in most lighting situations.  Spinel is a great gem stone and it's gotten very popular lately, but my advice is to look for lighter colored stones to avoid them graying out under fluorescent lights."

I can personally vouch for pricescope.com, as I've gotten a lot of awesome advice on there.

What is the material the necklace is made of, and can you take a picture?  That would give us more information to base our responses off of."
jewelry,3a258y,Sylentskye,2,Tue Jun 16 17:23:07 2015 UTC,"It is safe to wear, but it is not advised to be eating it or putting it in your mouth.  Your friend used a low-heat solder, usually used in computer applications. One reason why people use low-heat solder is because it's the only thing that can bond base metals. It melts at 150 degrees and is safe for stones and plating if done right. So if it's pot metal or brass/copper/tin/pewter, that's all that can really be done for it.  Now, if the necklace is made of silver, gold or platinum, that's okay. All you have to do is tell a jeweler to remove the current clasp, attach a new one, and solder it closed. This process will cost you ~$20 for sterling silver and ~$40-50 for 14K gold."

jewelry,3a258y,gofluxyourself,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:02:12 2015 UTC,"Be advised that if that clasp is heated up again for a future repair, the lead in the solder is going to pit and eat in to whatever metal it's on. You'll have to replace the clasp completely."

Bad alexandrite kind of looks like muddy, with a color change from brownish green khaki to brownish reddish khaki. It's really hard to take pictures of, and so hard to determine color. Real alexandrite is hard to find as well, there are sooo many fakes out there, especially in vintage rings. Also, real, good alexandrite is expensive. So, yes, it is  really cool gem, suitable for everyday wear, but a difficult gem to buy.   Multicolour.com is a trusted site with a range of alexandrite. I know people on pricescope.com have had good luck buying from them. The stones are not precision cut, usually, but the color quality is good, or at least fairly priced. As you can see, most do not have dramatic color change or really pure, beautiful colors, but if you really comb through,  you can find something good. I believe they are fair and honest about representing the color and pricing the gems. They are not USA based, so I'm not sure about shipping and returns.  Mastercutgems.com is a small scale US based gem cutter. He is really nice and easy to work with. He has a couple of cabochon cut alexandrite. They all small, cabochon (smooth cut) are not of the highest quality but reasonable priced and not bad specimens. I like the tiny non-catseye cabochon (. 60 carats) and one of the catseye cabochons (1.01 carats). These are good examples of nice but perhaps underwhelming color change in small sizes. Depending on your GF's taste, though, they could be good options. The price of larger gems with this color change goes up exponentially.   How do you feel about lab made alexandrite? If you know it's a synthetic going in and you don't mind it, that can be a good way to get a beautiful, reasonably priced stone. Up to you and your girlfriend.  Then there is a question of finding a jeweler willing to set the stone. Many don't take outside gems for fear of damaging them in the setting process. This is doubly true for alexandrite as they can be difficult to replace. What kind of style ring are you looking for?"
jewelry,39wa09,LlamaDR,3,Mon Jun 15 12:42:32 2015 UTC,"A few notes about lab made alexandrite. Most material sold as lab alexandrite is actually lab made sapphire with added vanadium. It has a blueish purple to purplish reddish pink color change, and much weaker pleochroism. True synthetic alexandrite is much more interesting - depending on what direction you look at it from, it will be green, blue, or red, and in certain lighting conditions it can be anywhere from rich red to pure emerald green.  Make sure you know which you're getting. True lab alexandrite is significantly more expensive, and can be more expensive than many natural stones."
jewelry,39wa09,cowsruleusall,4,Mon Jun 15 14:31:29 2015 UTC,"This is a good point. I meant true synthetic alexandrite for exactly the reasons you mentioned. It's not super cheap, but it's cool and much cheaper than comparable real alexandrite."
jewelry,39wa09,LlamaDR,2,Mon Jun 15 14:41:09 2015 UTC,"I am fairly open to a synthetic alexandrite as long as it's worth the money I spend on it. I saw a bunch of styles with either a swirl or ones with 3 stone setting (two small diamonds in the sides), I know she likes these styles.   I am open to other gem choices if people suggest that there are options that get me more bang. Like blue sapphire or something like that.   Any known good sellers for synthetic alexandrite?"
jewelry,39wa09,cowsruleusall,3,Mon Jun 15 20:54:50 2015 UTC,"There are surprisingly few people that sell true synthetic alexandrite, and significantly fewer who actually cut it well. Most sellers use alexandrite produced for lasers, which has a ridiculous amount of chromium and is extremely dark. To compensate, they deliberately cut it poorly and excessively shallow, which kills brilliance.  If you want ""good"" synthetic alexandrite, look for the lighter material that's used in some of the more interesting optical physics labs, and make sure you're getting pieces that are precision-cut. Remember, depending on which axis you look at, alexandrite has different colors, so orientation is critical. Precision cutters take this into account, while factory cutters just cut for maximum weight retention.  Allen Brown over at All That Glitters might still have some. I think Jeff Hapeman at Earth's Treasury might also have a piece.  You're definitely not gonna get anything else that's this interesting. You could go with color-change cubic zirconia or color-change synthetic sapphire, but neither has that pleochroism (different colors from different directions)."
jewelry,39wa09,LlamaDR,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:03:24 2015 UTC,"In terms of it being ""worth"" it, it's hard to answer that. Resale or appraisal value is one thing, being educated about your options and what they cost and paying an amount you're happy with for a product you want can be another thing. You know?   Blue sapphire is a good option and easier to source. Sapphires come in many colors. Spinels are also a good choice and similarly come in many colors. Chrysoberyl is alexandrite green/yellow cousin and can be really cool. Those are the stones that are hardy enough for everyday wear.   What is your price range for the whole ring?   How big of a center stone are you looking for? Equivalent in millimeter size to a 1 ct diamond? Or bigger/smaller?"
jewelry,39wa09,LlamaDR,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:48:26 2015 UTC,"Those are very good points and I am still researching. I am targeting something under $5000 for the whole ring. Anything over seems like an overkill. As far as the centerstone is concerned, I looked at a couple and knowing my girlfriend, it'll have to be smaller than 1ct but bigger than 0.5ct - round shaped diamond equivalent (if that helps) - again I am still figuring stuff out.   I did look at Chrysoberyl but she really doesn't like yellow - like really doesn't like it. I am going to research on sapphires, spinels and other gemstones some more tonight but this gives me a good start."
jewelry,39wa09,dickyankee,2,Tue Jun 16 01:14:43 2015 UTC,"I think that is a very healthy budget. You can probably come in well below if don't have sizable diamond side stones.   First thing I would do if I were you is research local non-chain jewelers. Most areas have a few artisans who do great work. They can source gems, blue sapphires will be especially easy. Tell them you want a precision cut gem. For sapphire, make sure it's not too dark. Do some price comparisons, check in here and see if the prices are reasonable. Sometimes markups can be crazy, but sometimes they can be perfectly reasonable.  Check prices against the options I list next. Also paying for convenience and particular aesthetics is no small thing.   Next, I would look for something from a non-volatile jeweler who handles both the stone and the setting. That way, you don't have to worry about insurance on the stone during the setting, etc. For this, some of my personal favorites are James Meyer, Michael E of Gems hope, Yvonne Raley on Etsy, Julia B on Etsy.  The first one doesn't do custom but has a lot great work. The others are more flexible. Michael cuts gems and can probably source and cut for you a nice synthetic alexandrite if that's the direction you want to go. Yvonne and Julia have a good selection of ready made and customizable gems.   EDIT: Oh yeah,  check out Bario Neal, Erica Winters and Jewels by Grace, too.   Some ideas:  http://jamesmeyerjewelry.com/wordpress/1410-2/#.VX-E7qopA0M  https://www.etsy.com/listing/211510746/trillion-flower-gatsby-ring-in-14-k (pretty wow if you like the color, but look through her sold for other ideas)   https://www.etsy.com/listing/168378083/three-stone-blue-sapphire-engagement (could be done with diamonds)   Next I would look for a stone to set separately. For this, I like gemfix, mastercutgems, whitesgems, Jeff Davies, finewatergems, to name a few."
jewelry,39wa09,gEmilyParks,2,Tue Jun 16 02:21:56 2015 UTC,"Consider other color change gemstones besides alexandrite, such as garnet, etc. I looked at the Multicolor.com website and they list tons of them. Cool stones, price is minus 2 zeroes compared to alexandrite."
jewelry,39wa09,LlamaDR,2,Mon Jun 15 21:40:57 2015 UTC,"Alexandrite is beautiful but as everyone has said here, it can be hard to find good quality alexandrite at a good price.  Have you considered tanzanite? It's really beautiful and has some of the color changing qualities of alexandrite but it's more subtle. It is a bit softer so if you wanted to go with tanzanite I'd recommend a setting that will protect the stone, like a bezel setting.  Sapphires and rubies are also great choices for engagement rings and are closer to diamonds in hardness so they are great for everyday wear.   What do you think of this?"
jewelry,39wa09,LlamaDR,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:24:58 2015 UTC,Yea I was looking at tanazite and was going to go to some jewellers in Seattle today to get some eyes on it. In pictures it seems pretty but I want to see with my own eyes.   Instead of a bezel I was thinking of something like swirls or something similar with small diamonds or other clear gems.   I'll post with updates and pics

They authenticate and photograph it for you, which is interesting. Just don't know what sort of audience they have at this point. But I was poking around their site and they like brand names.

jewelry,39tw5l,gnomesrome,2,Sun Jun 14 18:58:07 2015 UTC,"0.925 silver aka sterling silver is ""real"" silver.  It is the type used for silver jewelry because fine silver (0.999) can be too soft to work with.

jewelry,39g2y7,cutpeach,3,Thu Jun 11 14:11:41 2015 UTC,Taking night classes at a local trade school or museum/art school might be a good option.

jewelry,39g2y7,VolundJewelry,3,Thu Jun 11 19:34:32 2015 UTC,"You can approach this one of several ways.  The traditional path is to go to school of some sort, get a degree, and then apply for a job at a local shop somewhere and eventually work your way up. Another (also traditional way) is to apprentice under someone, taking a more hands-on approach and learning bench jewelry work, incorporating that into your designs, and repeat until you are confident in both to take on independent jobs. Finally, there is the self-taught approach. Learn to draw, draft, 3d model and experiment in non-precious materials and prototypes until you get to the skill level that you desire. Then go out and get work.  Whatever you do, I highly recommend that you do at least some silversmithing/goldsmithing - i.e. actually see your designs to completion. This will teach you a lot about the process and give you a fuller understanding of what is possible, what works, why things are done a certain way, etc. Many would-be 'designers' take a course that is removed from actual execution and then carry on producing designs that are disconnect from reality. Their work is easily recognizable and not in a good way.  Best of luck!"

If I were to get into jewellery making, I think it would be with the express aim of being a designer/maker. I know that a lot of designer outsource computer generated designs to other companies. I feel I'd prefer to construct pieces myself, currently I deal almost exclusively in gold, so a proficiency in goldsmithing would be the goal.   By any chance, could you recommend any literature or resources which may be useful for someone wanting to teach themselves i.e. basic equipment and techniques tutorials etc? I see a lot of books on amazon but it's difficult to know what is and isn't relevant.  Thanks again."
jewelry,39g2y7,sterlings925,3,Thu Jun 11 19:32:27 2015 UTC,Check out your local community colleges and jewelry studios.  They may offer classes with a jewelry focus.  I took a couple levels of metalsmithing for jewelry from a local studio (which I found through a local college).  No tests or grades or anything... just learning new techniques and then making projects using those techniques.

jewelry,39ac6p,RareBeautyEtsy,4,Wed Jun 10 19:34:28 2015 UTC,"Have you polished it? If not, it could be low Karat gold.   It is basically a mid-Victorian brooch, probably a collar pin. It may have had black enamel in it at one point, but it looks like it is gone.   The solder could be newer, where it broke and someone fixed it. (not a jeweler)  It's worth taking to a jeweler, just make sure they have a test acid for 9K gold.   Otherwise, use a magnifier, and look very closely at edges where wear would occur. If you see a different color metal (usually a darker brown) it indicates it is rolled gold, also known as gold filled. If you see a lot of wear, it indicates gold-plated, but these pieces are not usually plated.  Look up base taille enamel, and taille d' epargne if you want to see examples that have the black in the grooves.    Hallmarks wear off, and it could be covered by the big solder blob.   It's not worth a ton, but it's cute. Especially for free!"
jewelry,397i1u,yertles,6,Tue Jun 9 20:31:15 2015 UTC,"You would think with the price you pay for Tacori that they would be somehow higher quality than others but the fit and finish/overall quality is not much better than what you can get from plenty of other manufactures without the markup.  My main problem isn't specifically with Tacori it's this light, delicate and highly detailed style of ring that just does a poor job of standing up to daily wear.    Most girls want to wear their ring 24/7 and some people are just way harder on their jewellery than others.  If you're one of those people you might end up with endless problems $$$.  That being said I'm sure there are a percentage of people who don't have any problems at all (besides the wear on detailed parts).   My suggestion would be to have a separate ring that you wear when doing more active things and try to split the wear time between the two.  And I’m not talking about your wedding band that goes you’re your engagement ring, I’m talking another ring/wedding set all together.   Do not wear another band up against your Tacori ring without soldering it together, that will accelerate the wear and tear by a big factor.   I've had rings that are only a few years old that have multiple stones fall out,  lots of the millgrain and fine detail worn off and even bent/broken shanks.   Some designs are worse than others and the one you picked isn't the worst offender but not great.   And again it's not necessarily the fault of the ring or manufacturer.   This is my personal opinion but it's backed up by dealing with many Tacori rings and others just like them."

Depending on construction and weight, you're looking at a lot of money. My suggestion would be to see if you can find someone to export the model, then use Shapeways to create something only for you.

jewelry,393nl8,notable_bro,2,Wed Jun 10 21:30:05 2015 UTC,"Ooh, a challenge! How's this?  First design is a heart shaped stone in a bezel shaped with feathers, based off of the Egyptian concept of your heart being judged on a scale. Second is a black widow spider. Simple, easy. Third is an oroboros design, the Greek symbol for eternal life ""as one snake eats another"". The fourth is just a morbid face. Not a skull, slightly different.  Anyways, all sketches, but my own concepts. Feel free to send them to other designers, but as all designers go, I have three conditions:  1) You cannot sell these. 2) You must modify these by 10% if you have someone else make it. (Artistic license and whatever.) 3) I must see pictures of the finished product if you do use these.  I'd recommend black spinel or black star sapphire for stones. They're much harder wearing and will last longer. And I'd recommend 14k gold for ease of fabrication/strength/allergies.  Best of luck!"

You can also try adding 'memento mori' into your searches for more overtly death related designs. I agree with u/forwardseat, memorial jewellery is really very pretty but in a subtle, unusual way. Would certainly make for a one of a kind engagement ring! Aside from the typical woven hair and enamel designs, there are also rings featuring glazed painted miniatures, often featuring grieving women or urns and other symbols of mourning."

jewelry,38xut0,925Copper,2,Sun Jun 7 23:05:31 2015 UTC,"This type of link doesn't have a standard known name.  You can sometimes find it only known as a double charm link because it was very popular in the early 90's for charm bracelets.  Styles of links have gotten thinner due to metal prices so most charm bracelets have changed their link type.  Typically you can find charm bracelets today with a rolo, a cable or curb link. There is one company, that I know of, that can still produce this link.  The name of this manufacturer is Herco.  They are a California company but I'm sure you can find a local dealer. The link is not available in lengths longer than 8"" (for a charm bracelet) but it can be custom ordered per your required length.  It will take up to 6-8 weeks to complete from time of order because they are currently back logged from their orders from the recent JCK Las Vegas jewelry show. You can expect to pay up to $700.00 for this type of link in a length of 20""-22"" in sterling silver.  The price varies per metal markets pricing and weight of completed piece.  The sale would be final with no returns or exchange because this would be made exclusively for you. One of a kind, so it is possible.  I don't find it unreasonable but only you can make that determination.  Best luck."

jewelry,38xut0,Remark-Able,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:28:22 2015 UTC,"Post these pics in the maille subreddit. I'm on mobile so I can't link...  This could be easily duplicated as its a standard 1-1-1 maille weave that's made from custom rings that were made then woven together. It would have to be made one ring at a time vs something that could be woven quickly. Each ring is a small spiral section and it would not be hard to duplicate but it would be costly due to how long it would take. It would also be wire hungry further driving up the price. It could be made provided you can find the right person but it won't be cheap.   It reminds me of the way NailMaille weaves some of his pieces. Mike works in stainless steel nails but his work might give you a jumping off point for further research. There is more space between the wire itself in NailMaille compared to your pics showing a tighter ring. This bracelet of his is a very similar weave, only with nail heads and pointier wires. In fact, the pointed wire in the edge is what reminded me of Mike's work. http://www.metallicreptilian.com/nailmaille-h3-bracelet-with-stainless-steel-rings/?page_context=category&faceted_search=0  This ring shows the exact weave you need, only on a much smaller scale. http://www.metallicreptilian.com/nailmaille-finger-ring  You might even want to email or message him and see if he has any ideas for someone to commission a piece. He's a great guy but he may take a while responding depending on his work and show/festival schedule. I messaged him once with an idea and he was very responsive and mind blowing in how fast he had a sample to show me. It was only a few days until I had it in my hands.    Of course, if you want it out of 14g stainless nails he can hook you right up. :)"

Though the collar will need to be pushed off toward the narrow end. Keep in mind acetone can damage some stones so if you go this route you will need to keep an eye on it!  If you can get your self a hammer, a vice, a piece of leather or cloth, and a small punch (something hard enough to hammer lightly but small enough to only contact the collar) then you might be able to gently tap it off while the stone is held by the vice (protected by the cloth). But I would try the acetone first."

Glue it for added security if needed. Fixing it like this would be quick and impermanent. So, you could find a better solution when you have more time."

jewelry,38mz5o,fluffyboby,3,Fri Jun 5 06:58:17 2015 UTC,"Uruguayan amethyst always comes out at this nice color, but always comes out at a hefty price tag. We have a could of 6mm cabs that we got a few years ago, and retail price is around $80 each. Same thing with Siberian amethyst.  A 1ct fine amethyst from Brazil can run you about $10-20 retail unset. You can check out eBay or gem auction sites to see the prices of Uruguayan and Siberian amethyst just to get an idea, but remember to factor in at least $50 for the ring and $30-40 in labor for setting it.  My advice is: do what you feel like. I'd be charging around $100 for a simple ring (non recycled silver with a 6mm prong holding a nice amethyst). So if you feel like that's a good good deal, go for it."
jewelry,38mz5o,notable_bro,2,Fri Jun 5 15:41:16 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a reasonable price to me. If you like the stone and setting worrying about maybe $10 in price isn't worth it.

Well I found it on their site  http://www.jared.com/en/jaredstore/diamonds-100259--1/blue-white-diamonds-men--146%3Bs-ring-1-2-ct-tw-sterling-silver  There it is listed as sterling silver, but the guy who was working and sold it definitely told me 16k white gold, my wife said the same thing I thought when I asked her out of the blue about it. Ah well, whatcha gonna do I guess."
jewelry,38mzai,RareBeautyEtsy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:48:00 2015 UTC,"By law, there must be a mark inside that indicates the metal purity. Look carefully inside the ring. Take it to a different jeweler if you have to.  If it says .925, it is Sterling Silver. If it says 14K, or 15K, or 16K, or whatever with a K, it is that Karat of gold.  If it says BOTH, it is BOTH.  What does your receipt say? Both the blue and black diamonds are generally irradiated, low quality diamonds.   If the seller told you it is 16K gold, and it isn't, take it back.  It is WAY overpriced at that amount. If I were to price that ring, in Sterling, with those stones, I would do it around $80.00.  If they fooled you, ask for a full refund. If not, go up the line to corporate. It isn't worth it to them to have the bad publicity, so tell them you will plaster your story on Yelp, Facebook, Instagram, etc.  The laws are very strict about this, if you are in the US. If you have proof it was supposed to be 16K gold, (which would be very odd, it's not a normal alloy percent in the US) then you need to get your money back."

I think it has more color and would be more noticeable on your finger.   I feel like the first one better stands alone and the second one looks like a stack ring that is missing its friends.   Of course, your opinion is the only one that matters so buy the one that makes you happier.   Have you gone to the store and tried them on in person?

jewelry,38hz3o,PapillonLaLune,2,Thu Jun 4 17:18:14 2015 UTC,I like the first one. The stacking band is much thinner so it can be worn next to other rings like itself.  I wouldn't expect the amethyst to look so good as pictured. Best chances are that they altered the images to show better color depth. For the price I wouldn't worry to much about it.

jewelry,38frjq,studyworkoutsleep,4,Wed Jun 3 22:39:08 2015 UTC,"i think if you have a jeweler review it it should be fine for every day use, sapphire and ruby are the only colored stones i would say are suitable for an engagement ring, the prongs look fine on it but if the jeweler thinks they are worn down i would suggest getting it repronged and depending on how worn the shank is a reshanking would make it like new again, other than those two things if they are even needed a good cleaning and it should make a wonderful engagement ring."
jewelry,38frjq,zydrateaddict23,5,Wed Jun 3 23:34:09 2015 UTC,"Love the ring! Really great. Take it to a local family jeweler and ask if they would inspect it for you.  I would ask for them to point out and color all loose stones and any that are at risk of falling out so you can see how many there are.  The prong health looks good from here. Nothing paper line or at risk or breaking or bending.  The star sapphire, if loose, could possibly be tightened but it is at risk of breaking. I would simply ask that they polish the ring then tighten all loose stones then re-rhodium the ring.  Then ask if they would please place a thin line of jewelers epoxy along the bottom of the sapphire to the mounting to ensure a tight set stone.  You did not provide a photo of the shank but I can't imagine that it is paper thin.  This mounting was originally a two piece casting, soldered together. Really nice! Wear it in good health.  You can expect to pay up to $75-90 for such polishing, tightening and re-rhodiuming. Just a heads up.  Lastly, ask what is the proper cleaning solution you should purchase and what procedures you should practice to clean it are."

jewelry,38eocg,chartreuselion,2,Wed Jun 3 18:42:52 2015 UTC,"re rhodium is fine most women do it about once a year what happens is they polish it and then make sure its reallllly clean and then run an electric current through the piece to make the rhodium adhere to the metal, it will look like brand new and remove the yellow tinge and make it chrome again, its a super common procedure"
jewelry,38eocg,zydrateaddict23,2,Thu Jun 4 05:18:43 2015 UTC,"Experienced jeweler here.  When you take a ring to a jeweler to have it re-rhodiumed they first have to polish the ring. When you polish a ring it is very similar to when you sand a floor. If you happen to have a scratch in your hardwood floor sanding it is the only solution to getting the scratch out. Sanding levels the surface to the point where the scratch is no longer visible, essentially sanding away a scratch.  This is no difference when polishing a ring. If you polish the ring to take out scratches and dings, the jeweler will polish the rings surface until the scratch comes out. But the scratch never comes out; you're just bringing the metal surface surrounding the scratches and dings down to an even plane, minimizing the scratches and dings appearance. You wouldn't go to a nail salon and expect them to apply fresh nail polish over your old worn out polish right!? You would expect them to remove the old polish and buff your nails prior to re-applying the new polish on. Same goes with rings.  When your 14kw jewelry begins to wear it will expose the true white gold alloy beneath. Sort of a vanilla color. This has nothing to do with a rings performance. Every time you take a ring for re-rhodiuming they are required to polish it. Every time you have it polished you will be removing an amount of that jewelrys metal thickness away bit by bit. Polishing literally strips away metal and thus, life from a ring.  The more you rhodium it (dip it) the more they're gonna polish it. I wouldn't expect rhodium to be free. Expect a $75 to $115 cost on this type of servicing.  Keep in mind that you, under any circumstances, shouldn't rhodium any ring without proper polishing.  When rhodiuming a ring, the ring is placed onto a hook of a small rack. The rack is grounded electrically.  The rack is then placed into a tank.  The tank contains a solution of rhodium minerals and water. The solution is positively charged. The positively charged rhodium minerals in the solution are then attracted to the jewelry placed on the grounded rack. After a little while the jewelry is then extracted, rinsed and wiped clean. Rhodium is not cheap. I believe it runs for about $10,000.00 per ounce. The rhodium is shipped in a small bottle and appears to be the color of black coffee. Some of this solution is added to distilled water to create the tanks rhodium solution for plating. No chemical cleaners are used."

Cleaned & inspected, definitely. I haven't asked to get them polished, at least. A good cleaning is all I think they ever needed until now.   Thanks for the info!! I feel like I know a tiny bit more now about the proper care for my rings.   ETA: I know I said I got my rings polished 2 months ago, but now I keep thinking about it and I'm not sure they were actually polished."
jewelry,38eocg,catpflug,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:18:05 2015 UTC,"Are chemical cleaners used? That can wear away the rhodium more quickly. It doesn't hurt and is a personal preference if you want them looking super white again. I'd recommend getting a polish while you're at it which will remove a slight bit of metal but smooth out some nicks and dings. I wouldn't polish too often, but every few years probably won't be an issue."
jewelry,38eocg,catpflug,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:11:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think they use chemicals, but, I'm not 100% sure. I got my set polished about two months ago, and that's the only time I've done it. If I understand the jewellers correctly, they do plating for free, which is nice. I'll have to look and see what cleaners they use. Thanks!"
jewelry,38eocg,JamesTiberiusChirp,2,Wed Jun 3 20:24:51 2015 UTC,Polishing can remove the rhodium. We always plate after a polish. Have you noticed more of a difference after the polish?
jewelry,38e87g,didolce,2,Wed Jun 3 17:11:51 2015 UTC,"I'm a hobby gem cutter that works with sapphires.  For that kind of money I think you need an independent, reputable lab report.  GIA and AGL are the best, you can tell the jeweler the sale is contingent on the report.  I seriously doubt that sapphire has only been heated, which leads me to seriously distrust this jeweler.  My money's on diffused, if not synthetic.  If heat only that price would have another another zero in it.  'It's their understanding...'  This looks and sounds like a very unethical jeweler.  Get yourself to the colored stones forum on pricescope.com and throw yourself on the mercy of the old biddies there who love to help naive gem shoppers find good deals on high quality gems."

jewelry,38e87g,cowsruleusall,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:21:55 2015 UTC,"It is gorgeous. I have a sapphire myself.  First, heat-treated sapphires are so common that many consider it a non-treatment. It's just something that is done, because it almost always enhances the color. Many consider it a natural treatment.  That said, a natural sapphire can often show white banding from different angles. The crystal grows in a hexagonal shape, and the white bands, to put it very simply, are where the sapphire decided to stay white rather than become blue. Think of rings in a tree trunk. They are not all the same color.  But then it gets complicated. Synthetics can also have banding, but it will look different. It takes an expert to tell.  My questions:  Do you trust the jeweler? Are they independent, reputable, family-owned? Do they have a GIA trained gemologist on staff, who has appraised the ring?  Are they willing to have it looked at by a gemologist, if not?   Ask them to dip the ring in mineral oil, or something that will change the look. They will know what you are trying to do, they may even have special liquids that they can use. (It won't hurt it) This will show you what it will look like when it is not in the jewelry store, spotless and sparkly. It will get dirty if you wear it every day, so you want to still love it, even when it isn't clean. Ask someone to go outside with it, away from the special lights. Turn it. Do you still love it?   TL'DR: I think it is stunning. Banding is normal, in natural and synthetic sapphire. Only the most expensive sapphires have no (discernible) banding at all. Keeping it clean will minimize the appearance of banding. Buy from a reputable, family store."
jewelry,38e87g,RareBeautyEtsy,2,Wed Jun 3 20:01:37 2015 UTC,"First, heat-treated sapphires are so common that many consider it a non-treatment. It's just something that is done, because it almost always enhances the color. Many consider it a natural treatment.   This is untrue. While heat-treatment of sapphires is extremely common, it is always considered a treatment and, in virtually every country, requires disclosure. There is no such thing as a ""natural treatment"".  Other than that, you're mostly right about the banding. Sapphires that grow in stages can frequently have alternating bands of color. The most common would be alternating bands of blue and yellow in Australian sapphires, but other combinations are also possible. Natural sapphires, hydrothermal sapphires, and some flux-grown sapphires will have hexagonal banding, while flame-fusion sapphires will have circular banding with bubbles.  Unrelated - this gemstone is terribly cut. It has a large ""window"", that fish-eyed area in the middle of the stone that looks dead. This is because the stone was (likely intentionally) cut poorly, as a ploy to artificially buff up the finished weight of the stone and increase the sale price to naive buyers. If the stone was cut properly, to maximize color and brilliance, it would have a smaller face-up area and a lower carat weight - sure, it would look significantly better and command a significantly higher price to educated buyers...but the goal for things like this is fast turnover and a less-educated consumer."
jewelry,38e87g,cowsruleusall,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:56:13 2015 UTC,"First, i was explaining in laymen's terms. I think you know that. Almost every sapphire is heat-treated. I think you know that, also. It is an accepted practice that is common knowledge. I was trying to help OP understand.   Bring up semantics, fine. Not helping OP. Heat Treatment isn't meant to deceive, like oiling or filling. It just is an accepted practice. It is permanent, in sapphires.   When I responded, there was only one photo, and it did not shoe any window.   Not my fault, ok? Please don't try to make it as if I am incorrect due to more info being posted.   Also, there is such a thing as diplomacy. I think you will agree that I brought up the right questions. OP loves the ring. I was simply trying to be nice about it."

There are plenty of tutorials online for that. I recommend checking local wiccan type shops. The ones in my area always have a variety of stones in different shapes and sizes, including the pencil point ones you like."
jewelry,38bozr,lemonbee,2,Wed Jun 3 10:13:14 2015 UTC,"It might not be that difficult to buy the ones with the metal caps and remove those caps. If you're going to have the jewelry made by a professional jeweler, they should be able to drill a hole if needed, and they might have a source where they can order stones like you want."
jewelry,38bbqg,MissBooWinkle,2,Wed Jun 3 02:48:23 2015 UTC,Sand. Lots of sand under pressure. Sand blasting is all you can do.
jewelry,38bbqg,z4cadpro,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:28:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe steel wool? I'm not sure if that would work on tungsten, but you could try."
jewelry,38bbqg,Argentis,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:28:21 2015 UTC,Nothing else will work. ScotchBrite pads would do wonders for alloys but not tungsten. Tungsten is not an alloy or a metal. It starts as a powder. Under strong magnification you would see tiny tiny golf ball shaped particals bound to each other from extreme heat. It can break and split but never really scratch or take extra abuse just because of its characteristics.
jewelry,38bbqg,z4cadpro,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:32:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll try sandpaper! And then steel wool if that doesn't work. It's not a big deal since the ring is pretty cheap so I'll get someone to do it professionally if all fails."
jewelry,38bbqg,z4cadpro,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:07:08 2015 UTC,Well finding a matte finished tungsten ring wouldn't be difficult. What would be difficult is when you're looking for one that is 3mm wide. That's almost damn near impossible because the ring needs its width for strength and overall durability. Best of luck.
jewelry,38bbqg,z4cadpro,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:03:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah it has proven to be difficult. They have tons of 2mm rings, though, just not many 3mm rings. The ring is for my fiance and he has delicate fingers. A 2mm would match my own band and be fragile, and a 4mm looks a tiny bit too wide. He has tried both widths and we agree that 3mm would be best. Thanks again!"
jewelry,38bbqg,z4cadpro,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:08:04 2015 UTC,"Go with the 4mm. It'll be best for a ""marry to bury"" ring. 2mm will have to be replaced over and over again; much to fragile and brittle. It's okay if his ring doesn't match yours. He will never get used to a 2mm ring. It's far to thin it fit comfortably. <- that is only my feeling"
jewelry,38bbqg,JamesTiberiusChirp,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:28:38 2015 UTC,Try sandpaper as a second option or method.
jewelry,38bbqg,z4cadpro,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:33:19 2015 UTC,diamond files?
jewelry,38bbqg,JamesTiberiusChirp,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:35:37 2015 UTC,Good suggestion. I only suggested sand blasting or sand paper because I had a client once return a ring to our store because it was completely damaged. The finish was abraided from his tours in Iraq. Sand is a motherfucker.
jewelry,38bbqg,z4cadpro,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:35:39 2015 UTC,"Huh! I figure it's easier for someone to buy a $10 set of diamond files (or diamond sandpaper? Is that a thing?) off amazon than get acces to a sandblaster, but maybe he could agitate it in a box of sand for a similar effect."
jewelry,38bbqg,JamesTiberiusChirp,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:51:40 2015 UTC,"I didn't know diamond files were so economical. It is a good suggestion.  If this were me, I'd find a local machine shop and take it there and ask them if a sandblaster would make tungsten carbide matte.  They'd probably do it for a few bucks or maybe just for free just for shits and giggles.  It would be just as economical.  Lets just hope he'll come back and update us."

jewelry,38bbqg,eoot,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:39:27 2015 UTC,"Those rings sure do look thin for being tungsten.  I speak about the ring thickness, not there width.  I don't think I've ever seen a 3mm tungsten ring.  Maybe, just maybe, the thinnest I've ever seen were 5mm. They require this thickness for strength and durability."
jewelry,38bbqg,zydrateaddict23,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:33:30 2015 UTC,I would be very surprised if you came up with a satisfactory result.   Most the alternative metal bands are next to impossible to modify or work with in that way.  If you do manage to get something to work I'd love to see pictures and a description.
jewelry,388ah4,Real_Emotional_Trash,8,Tue Jun 2 15:45:19 2015 UTC,"Hey OP! Gemcutter here. As much as I hate PriceScope (lots of inaccurate information about gemstone rarity, cutting quality, and how well gemstones hold up to wear), they're actually still a pretty good resource.  I'll tell you right now that all sapphires with warm colors have a high risk of being beryllium-diffused, even if the seller doesn't know it. Beryllium diffusion is basically an ""extra"" done during heat treatment, so any time a stone has a warm color AND has heat treatment, that's a warning sign. The Thais and the Chinese were doing this treatment for over a decade before any of the major labs knew about it. However...this sapphire doesn't look to be a shade that's normally produced by Be-treatment.  The GIA colored-stone grading system is terrible, unfortunately, because the way it's structured is such that you can't directly compare two stones of different species. From the pictures, this sapphire looks fine. Not too included, cutting quality is not terrible. The inclusion will, however, be very visible when you tilt the stone, because of the way light will end up bouncing off of it.  Is this a nice sapphire? Yes, if it's actually a sapphire. Is it worth $4.5k? No. It would be if it was that size and not included."
jewelry,388ah4,cowsruleusall,2,Tue Jun 2 19:05:25 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, why is beryllium diffusion bad?"
jewelry,388ah4,JamesTiberiusChirp,5,Wed Jun 3 03:33:03 2015 UTC,"It's...not, really. It's just another form of treatment. It's considered in the trade to be one step more ""severe"" than heat treatment, though, because you're artificially adding in an element that's not normally found in corundum, and you're using it to totally change the color of the stone rather than improve an existing color. Also, beryllium is toxic, so Be-diffused sapphire needs to be cut while wearing a better mask than normal cutting.  The main problem is undisclosed Be-diffusion. Normally, these colors are very rare in nature, and command a high price because of their natural rarity. Be-diffusion can create those colors, but it's artificial. Since the high price is due to rarity and not due to any particular taste in color, undisclosed Be-diffusion inflates the price of what would otherwise be common sapphire.  Make sense?"
jewelry,388ah4,cowsruleusall,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:27:48 2015 UTC,Definitely makes sense now!
jewelry,388ah4,JamesTiberiusChirp,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:49:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input. What in your opinion would you value it at?
jewelry,388ah4,cowsruleusall,3,Tue Jun 2 20:11:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe $200/ct, $2k max for the ring, $120 for the diamonds."
jewelry,388ah4,RareBeautyEtsy,4,Tue Jun 2 20:35:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, what cowsruleusall said. I belonged to a gem club, and the members were buyers, and we talked about this years and years ago.   Additionally, a standard appraisal is done under 10x magnification, not just looking at the stone. So, I am a bit hesitant.  This is not a terribly difficult ring to make, style-wise. I would find a stone, then get the setting. Spending that much on a ring you cannot see, with the issues I see with the appraisal-that-is-not-really-an-appraisal, make me kind of wonder."
jewelry,388ah4,tourmaqueen,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:46:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, agreed. With all the feedback I have received here and on pricescope.com, I have decided to move on from this seller."
