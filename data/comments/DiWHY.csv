DiWHY,3ct590,ZeroError,5,Sun Jul 12 23:42:33 2015 UTC,I was thinking the slot just wasn't cut all the way through so you couldn't actually put them in. Exceeded my expectations.

DiWHY,3ct590,FreeSammiches,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:25:16 2015 UTC,Wow that was the most intense exclamation mark. I literally watched every moment of him writing that shit.
DiWHY,3cvm7s,shelbzoo,8,Sat Jul 11 03:42:34 2015 UTC,It's deceptively difficult.
DiWHY,3cvm7s,StrewwelChris,6,Sat Jul 11 03:52:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, just drop it right onto the cold granite...  I've helped friends do this, if you don't have a heat lamp handy then it's one persons job to get a Hairdryer/hot air blower going constantly.  Also silicon mats are not that expensive and are your best friend."
DiWHY,3cvm7s,ChriskiV,4,Mon Jul 13 11:35:37 2015 UTC,"Your sister needs to lay of the sugar, at home or otherwise."
