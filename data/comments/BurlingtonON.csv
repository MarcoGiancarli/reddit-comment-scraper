Dymonds on Fairview between Appleby and Walkers is open late depending on how busy they are. Good on weekends in the winter when dueling pianos happen.   Beaver & Bulldog is good during the week, turns into a dance club on Friday and Saturday night though.   Queens Head, Sly Fox, Dickens, and Carrigan Arms are all pubs. All open late and no dress code at all.   Supreme Bar and Grill and Tin Cup are sports  bars, the same with Wendall Clark.   Depending on what area you are in, there is bound to be at least one bar open late. QB's, Clancy's, and Boston Manor normal close by midnight during the week. Downtown keeps open until 2am but inconvenient if you have to drive home."

And the bar areas are not physically separated from the dining rooms.  The Queen's Head bar area is in the middle of the major traffic flow to the bathrooms.  I love Wendel's for actually wanting to sit and have a few drinks at the bar.  It's a big bar - they have dozens of TV's to watch.  They will put on whatever channel you want to watch.  We've gone off the Dickens in the past year.  Used to go every week."

The tree companies just wanted to come in with equipment and chop everything down.  An arborist knows how to trim the tree to keep it healthy.  They also specialize in tree removal by dude with rope and chainsaws.  We have had great success with Thomas from Timberwolf Tree Care.  We were impressed by an initial consultation by Christian, from Roots to Shoots; but they were unable to come through with a formal quote so we didn't hire them.  I should also mention that our backyard is not accessible by heavy equipment; and our trees are all 55+ years old.  We are trying to keep them as healthy as possible, for as long as possible."

Guelph Line is non stop red lights, construction/city crews constantly shutting down lanes of traffic during rush hour.  The dear folks who likely should have surrendered their licenses on heir 80th birthdays blocking traffic at 40kph. It seems 25% of drivers are on their phones or otherwise distracted and can't maintain a steady, productive speed.  Stopping 40 feet behind the car in front of you?  Is it law in Burlington that the first car turning left at an advanced green must count to 20 before they start their turn....resulting in 2 or 3 cars making the turn before light changes?  It IS legal to turn right on a red in Burlington isn't it?  The first 30km of my commute takes 20 minutes, tops.  The last 5km are in Burlington and take another 15....with lights etc factored in it's an average of roughly 20kph.    I understand the aggressive drivers....more often than I care to admit I am probably one of those aggressive (frustrated?)drivers."

BurlingtonON,3ah0f0,bayoemman,8,Sat Jun 27 18:51:30 2015 UTC,"It's strange; I actually think that Burlington has some of the most passive drivers of anywhere I ever lived (Guelph, Windsor, Markham, Toronto, Oakville, Hamilton).  Maybe that's why I end up so annoyed while driving here.  The one thing I've noticed that I find completely enraging is that Burlingtonians can't seem to understand how to make left turns at lit intersections.  Fairview/Maple and Fairview/Brant are the worst.  People don't proceed and pause in the intersection if there is opposing traffic.  It's like we have a whole municipality with vehicular Zoolander syndrome.    I've sat and waited behind a string of cars because one person will not enter the intersection when the light turns green due to on coming traffic and then does not clear that intersection when it turns amber/red.  I've waited behind one of these jerks for multiple light cycles until they managed to get around the turn. You pull that kind of shit anywhere else, you'd have people knocking on your window to give you a piece of their minds..."
BurlingtonON,3ah0f0,thejoyouknow,-2,Sat Jun 20 12:54:36 2015 UTC,"They teach kids not to do that in Drivers Ed now.  They teach them to stop back in the left turn lane and only turn if the way is clear, otherwise they're supposed to stop and wait through another light."
BurlingtonON,3ah0f0,figtoria,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:49:28 2015 UTC,"False. I've completed drivers Ed with young drivers and we were all taught the S approach. Which is to enter a lane and match the opposing directions left turn lane. Something no one in Burlington seems to get is that doing this on both sides allows both drivers to spot spots of open traffic. So many times I'll be stuck at a light unable to see around the giant Silverado who refuses to S approach in the I left turn lane just cause they can see over my little hatchback.   There's definitely cities with worse drivers, but I at least expect bad driving there so I find it less road rage inducing. Burlington seems to get under my skin most. Between people immobile from texting to people just doing minor bad practises, it makes driving here almost unbearable on a regular basis.   Edit: it's not a disagree button."

BurlingtonON,3ah0f0,THISAINTNOPARTY,3,Sat Jun 20 17:23:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a terrifying city to bike in.  Drivers do not offer bikers any safety at all.  I once was turning left on a side street at a stop sign with a car behind me.  I signalled properly and started my turn and the guy sped up as I started to go, slammed on his breaks as soon as I started to turn they laid on the horn.  Fuck you guy, I was doing things properly.  Now I just ride on the sidewalk and cross at stop lights.  Doing things properly isn't worth the safety risk here."
BurlingtonON,3ah0f0,Tanag,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:50:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's a real shame to see people riding on sidewalks especially on side roads and streets with a bike lane. Try not to let one bad experience shake you. Be confident, establish yourself on the road and take the lane if need be. Don't let entitled drivers intimidate you. I think taking to the streets will force drivers to learn how to drive safely around cyclists and enforce the idea that we have just as much right to the road. Biking isn't a weekend pass time for toddling around the neighbourhood, it's time more people accept this."
BurlingtonON,3ah0f0,THISAINTNOPARTY,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:08:39 2015 UTC,"I have to say, since moving to Burlington I have seen some INSANE driving. I espeically hate the people who park their car right outside of the stores they are ""just popping in to"". Getting from Burlington Go to Upper Middle and Guelph at 5pm is a nightmare. The amount of times I have had to slam on the breaks on Fairview is crazy, between people merging lanes without signaling or looking, people making turns in front of me, or BMWs trying to cross three lanes through advanced turn lanes causing major delays...my temper, and nerves are frayed.  My only other day to day canadian driving experince has been in Guelph though.  In the defence of drivers, the pedestrian culture (i guess you would call it) in Burlington is even worse. I have never seen so many teenagers with death wishes. ""Oh what's this? A car coming? I'll just run out in front of it!"" The people that just casually walk along fairview during rush hour..Its 5 bloody lanes!! They just casually stroll across like it's no big deal!"

Seriously though, Burlington is not even in the same league as most other places in the world that I have been. Any larger city in southern Europe, Paris, Rome, Spain, Greece, Turkey, any non tourist area in Mexico, even Montreal is much much worse. In the USA, I have been to most large cities, Boston stands out for really aggressive drivers. I haven't spent much time in Asian/African countries.

I don't know where this came from, same with changing lanes in the middle of an intersection - neither are right and don't really make sense.  If you want to see some real stupidity just go down dundas towards Oakville. I've seen left turns from far right lanes, people nearly eating sidewalk because they waited way to long to merge, lots of brake slamming for no reason, people blazing through the community zone near the school going 40 over for no reason, people going straight through Dundas and Walkers well into a red light, leaving anyone that was set to turn stuck in the intersection, people going 30 in the 80, school busses leaving their lot just cut off 4 lanes with little attention given and as soon as a little snow dusts it you might as well use one lane because of how many accidents there are. It's fun.  Oh and while I'm at it, Burlington could save a killing on cars if they took out the turn signals - it's not like many people use them."

It's kind of a chicken and the egg problem, no one wants to use it because it's not very good, but until more people use it, it can't become very good. Seriously though, you can get by on transit in Burlington, but realistically Burlington is a city built on the automobile, and is not particularly transit friendly. Just the way neighborhoods are built are not really designed to be super friendly to getting around by bus. Even as a teenager our parents always drove us around, taking the bus just wasn't a thing. I haven't used transit in Burlington myself so I can't comment on the reliability. Burlington is suburbia, but I'm hoping you already knew that before you decided to move here.  As far as where to live in Burlington, one of the best things about Burlington is that there aren't really any bad areas, the only area I've heard bad things about is the apartments on Warwick Court (just south of the IKEA), and even then, it's Burlington so it's probably not that bad. Given your transportation issue, I would make this your top priority when considering where to live. Finding a home that is close to transit stops, and as short a ride as possible to your most common destinations is probably going to make the biggest impact on your experience. Get familiar with the transit services and maybe even do test rides on the buses from the areas you are looking at."

BurlingtonON,3abpr3,dober420,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:42:07 2015 UTC,"I think the best value for housing built around transit these days would be near glenwood school Dr. There is a pedestrian over pass that will put you right near the go station and Walmart. And the town house at the end of the road have relatively low condo fees.  Edit: I need to add that at this location you wouldn't be far from the core, Burlington mall and maple view mall, Goodness Me, holland park, nickel brook brewery and wine, all of the (4?)restaurants on Fairview St between Guelph Line and Drury. Plus plains Rd and Brant plazas. No a bad spot for  $350k 3bed 2bath townhouse with $250/condo fees."
BurlingtonON,3abpr3,turniptruck,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:16:52 2015 UTC,If taking out a 450k mortgage doesn't make you sweat surely you can just go buy a used car. Burlington is a place you drive around. Anyone I've seen waiting for bus looks miserable. And your hunch is right. The bus shelters are quiet inconsistent and sparse.
BurlingtonON,3abpr3,Calypsee,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:23:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the responses. My budget is stretched to the ends at $465,000. I'm really hoping I can get something freehold with less. If I can, maybe I can look for a vehicle. Right now I'm just trying to figure out where to look.  Again thanks to all of you for the info!!"
BurlingtonON,3abpr3,KingpinCola,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:21:30 2015 UTC,"Look on mls.ca for an idea of what $465k gets you here. If I cap the search at $450k, filter it by ""freehold"" and stay within the city bounds (especially since you don't drive), there are 29 listings and 4 of those listings are duplicates. The 29 listings drop to 25 if I look for 2+ beds.  If you don't have a vehicle, look for something within walking/biking  distance of your work. If that isn't possible, try to look at the transit map here to get an idea of which areas actually have routes that run through them."
BurlingtonON,3a94jl,MonsieurLeDrole,7,Thu Jun 18 05:18:27 2015 UTC,I was born in Joe Brant...29 years ago and Im Still kicking
BurlingtonON,3a94jl,bovickles,7,Thu Jun 18 06:12:09 2015 UTC,"My daughter was born at Joe Brant back in March (I'm the dad).  Had no issues at all.  Was treated really well.  We had midwives who did the delivery, but the nurses who came by afterwards were all very friendly and helpful.  The lactation clinic in JB we felt was especially great.  We did a hospital tour beforehand and liked what we saw.  I'd recommend doing tours at both places if time allows (book well in advance).  No experience with Mac, so I can't comment if it is a better or worse experience."
BurlingtonON,3a94jl,griebelking,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:31:27 2015 UTC,Same experience here pretty much. Midwives make all the difference I think.

They pushed formula after my daughter was born and the after care nurses were not very helpful. I remember waiting 20mins for someone to come help me latch. If I had the choice I would have gone to McMaster, I haven't heard any bad things from my friends who went there."

BurlingtonON,3a94jl,BurlGirl,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:34:42 2015 UTC,That's wonderful you had a good experience with her. I've heard good and bad things. My experience was awful.
BurlingtonON,3a94jl,littlemsmuffet,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:05:40 2015 UTC,She was my OB and delivered my daughter because she stayed 2.5 hours after her shift ended.  My first impression at her office wasn't good because I felt that she rushed me and didn't have time for questions.  But she turned out being great for us.  I think she stayed because I was such a high risk pregnancy and was also vbac.
BurlingtonON,3a94jl,Stircrazyq,2,Tue Jun 23 15:41:58 2015 UTC,That's awesome she stayed for your delivery. I had her a couple of times when I had a few false labors and she wasn't very friendly to me. Then when I was in labor I had an even worse experience. So maybe I just caught her on a few bad days. Lol
BurlingtonON,3a94jl,littlemsmuffet,3,Tue Jun 23 16:06:51 2015 UTC,I was born at Joe Brant. I'm pretty alive.
BurlingtonON,3a94jl,eandi,2,Thu Jun 18 20:05:14 2015 UTC,My daughter was born there 8 months ago. It was our first child and so we don't have any reference points. Nurses were very nice. We had our own room though which of you share a semi the husband isn't allowed to stay over night and has to leave.   My sister in law delivered twins at McMaster. They messed up her epi and had to redo it and the waiting room is just a blank white room with no TVs or anything. Joe Brant has a waiting area with lots of chairs TVs a play room for young kids.
BurlingtonON,3a94jl,Stircrazyq,2,Fri Jun 19 13:27:06 2015 UTC,"Both my kids were born at Jo Brant, but I honestly wish I thought to try McMaster.  I had midwives for my first and a doula for my second.    First experience at Jo Brant wasn't very good partly because it was an emergency csection.  I felt well taken care of up until the csection was over.  There was an assistant doc (I think he was a doc) who just stood beside me and stared as the two nurses cleaned me up.  I don't know what the hell he was staring at but I was naked from the waist down, so I felt really creeped out and I often thought back to those moments afterward and I wish I wasn't traumatized enough to actually complain.   After my son was born and taken to special care nursery, was our second bad experience.  There were 2 different Linda's in there taking are of the preemies.  The younger one was very nice but the older one was very bossy and rude to us.  I had instructions about not wanting my son to have a soother, but she gave him one anyway to shut him up.  She also told me he had to stay in special care while I recover, and I was allowed to take him into my room between feedings. I told my midwife this on her first visit to me and she went and got him and updated my chart to advise them he stays with me and they can come get him for feedings if necessary.   This pissed Linda off enough for her to storm into my private room uninvited, sit in my guest chair and start pointing her finger at me while I laid in bed. Telling me SHE should be taking care of MY baby because I'm trying to recover from an emergency situation.  She was very rude and I told her no, I know how to take care of him and he's not to get a soother and I'd like to be advised on anything else they plan on doing or giving him.    Thank goodness for my midwives to let me know I had a lot more rights with mine and my sons care while in the hospital.  That nurse tried to make me think they called the shots and if we didn't like it, tough.  My stay was 4 days and between that nurse and the creepy doc in the OR, it was one of the most terrible experiences in my life."
BurlingtonON,3a94jl,ma3x5,2,Tue Jun 23 16:00:26 2015 UTC,We had our daughter at Joseph brant and were not very happy with the staff.  VERY pushy with breastfeeding and when we made it clear that we were going to formula feed our baby the staff was incredibly rude.

Everyone these days thinks their older games are super rare and it shows particularly on ebay, and the shipping can be disgusting if it's coming from over the border.  There's nothing wrong with it if you have the cash, but starting on a budget I'd say Game Haven on Brant like the others have, and if you want online go with Lukie Games - http://www.lukiegames.com/ They have a points system for free stuff, and some of their stuff is fairly priced and you can reach free shipping if you don't mind the long wait for the package.  Don't do 1UP if you like your wallet, they have great stock but their prices are at ebay level, some higher."

BurlingtonON,38k4el,BBurlington79,6,Fri Jun 5 14:34:14 2015 UTC,"Aside from Russell Williams which was already suggested, there's a little place on Fairview called ""Harvest Table"". It's very simple and homely, the last time I was there the decor was still pretty out of date, but it's cheap and the food is generally pretty good, and the people there are very nice. It's got a very specific atmosphere though, which while some people love I could definitely see it turning others off.  The other one I can think of is Wimpy's Diner on Guelph Line, which is pretty good too. Obviously that one kind of depends on if you like the diner style or not, and whether that matches up with the ""homemade"" feel to you."
BurlingtonON,38k4el,-xe,2,Thu Jun 4 20:10:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed for Harvest Table, it's been a weekly spot for me for years.  It definitely has an older look but the food is consistent and the folks there are awesome."

BurlingtonON,35vazv,FreakyWays,2,Fri May 22 03:09:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with loudstar. Zesty Pita has some incredible halal burgers and grilled chicken wraps. Unlike subway or pita pit frozen meats, zesty pita chicken and Burgers are cooked fresh on an open flame. I am vegan so I always get falafel and Greek salad. Buy kids who go to Nelson High love their burgers and grilled shawarma chicken wraps. They catered to my work place  at  cogeco on Burloak 2 weeks ago and the food cost about $4 to $5 per person. The quality is amazing and value is incredible. It is by far the best in Halton for that type of sandwiches. Their Facebook page shows some catering photos and they have great reviews on Yelp. Not sure if they have other locations but one I know is on Walkers and New st in Burlington. Hope this is helpful"

As you all know, we just pulled out a lot of tires and garbage out of Bronte Creek this past weekend. There is still TWICE the amount of garbage at the bottom of the ravine. We have made repairs to our cart and are ready to do another pulley event to collect the remaining tires and garbage. We know that everyone's schedules fill up as summer approaches, but we would like to know if any of our volunteers would be willing to participate in completing the clean-up this spring, or whether we should wait until the fall. We need 25 confirmed volunteers to run this event, and propose the date and time of Saturday, June 6th from 10 AM to 2 PM. If you are available and would like to participate, please send us a message! Once we get 25 confirmed volunteers we will set up an event.  We have about 11 signed up as of right now.  I have attached a picture from our last clean up.  Best regards,  David Hulsman"

French is one of the very few languages spoken all over the world, ranked the sixth most widely spoken language after Mandarin Chinese (over a billion speakers), English, Hindi, Spanish and Arabic.   There's 4 more appropriate languages to offer immersion schooling in.  Teach mandarin if you're looking for ""opportunities""."

BurlingtonON,318tyx,CubeTurret,3,Thu Apr 2 22:31:27 2015 UTC,"I inquired about it last year.... here is the email I received when I asked when they were recruiting.  Hello, I am one of the Training Officers here at the Burlington Fire Department. You have asked about our next hire for the Volunteer program and I cannot answer the question specifically at this time. When we require additional Volunteers(retirements ect) we will set up a 16 – 18 week course on Saturdays and Wednesday nights. We will run the course in either the Spring from late February until June or in the Fall from September until December. We are currently having the Headquarters building renovated and I am not sure as to when our Deputy Chief will request another course.  When the course is requested by the Chief we will advertise the openings on the City of Burlington website and also in the Post newspaper. There will be a review of the resume’s received and interviews will be set up. Please note that you must be over 18 and a resident of Burlington to be considered. The selection will then depend on the size of the class required.  If you are interested in becoming a Volunteer  you are encouraged to attend the Headquarters building at 1255 Fairview Street  if you live south of # 2 Sideroad at about 6:45 pm on Wednesday night and explain that you are interested in becoming a Volunteer and they will take your name and contact information. If you live North of # 2 Sideroad you are encouraged to go to the Station at 2241 Kilbride Street in North Burlington.  Thanks  Mike  Mike James  Training Officer  Burlington Fire Department  905-333-0772 ext 6223  905-971-7236 cell  Mike.James@burlington.ca"
BurlingtonON,318tyx,blasma,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:43:34 2015 UTC,"This does explain & answer a lot.Since the answer I received was;    Yea I'm the exact same I live real close to station 1. I was unsure about exactly what station 1's duties are, but I know for sure they don't go out to calls. Look on the burlington website I'm pretty sure it even mentions something about that.    I have looked for the last hour on the burlington website and have turned up NOTHING about station 1 on fairview being a full time station and no volunteer's will not be going out to calls.  But I am looking for information that says that they do. I assume since station 1 & 5 are volunteer ""company"" stations that they do go out on calls all year round. If anyone else has information let me know  Thanks for the information"
BurlingtonON,318tyx,Shifty89,2,Fri Apr 3 00:21:58 2015 UTC,"I think right now, with the renos going on at HQ, the volunteers are running out of station 8(appleby and uppermiddle area). HQ should be finished late this year or early next year i think."

BurlingtonON,318tyx,Shifty89,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:19:57 2015 UTC,Yes station 5 is all volunteers. if there is a call in their area a call goes out to station 2 or 7. station 5 doesn't always have volunteer staff on hand to go right away. so they wait till they get people in. then go out.
BurlingtonON,318tyx,Shifty89,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:38:39 2015 UTC,IM TERRIBLY SORRY I mixed up stations. I meant station 1 this whole time (fairview street)

But as far as i know all the volunteer trucks are parked at station 8 right now. so Its my guess they are running out of that station for the time being.  (I just listen in on calls and go take photos when something big happens)  for the last bit I know the volunteer trucks have been returning to station 8 after calls.

Its just our IE ( implementation engineers) happen to work from Atlanta and travel pretty much anywhere in the US and Canada.

Parking/entrances are not far from the Mohawk racetrack at 10 Siderd and 4th Line or a bit up at 10125 4th line there's a little parking lot.  I reccomend bringing a GPS app of some sort since the trails aren't marked and rather mazey- there are WAY more trails than the ones shown on the maps on Halton's site."
BurlingtonON,2v4cyt,ptrin,4,Sat Feb 7 20:05:18 2015 UTC,"Downtown has a few nice places if you look around. The Martini House is a nice place.  The Boston Manor is a nice place during the week, but they may have a band on Saturdays."
BurlingtonON,2v4cyt,ArcadeRob,3,Sat Feb 7 21:21:39 2015 UTC,"In my opinion - the Dickens, The Queenshead, and the Poacher make up the core triumvirate of halfway decent bars in Burlington. It's in kind of a weird spot but the Black Bull is pretty alright too."

BurlingtonON,2v4cyt,Ganglebot,3,Thu Feb 19 20:35:28 2015 UTC,It's worth the trip downtown to The Poacher or The Queen's Head. Clancy's at Appleby and Fairview is pretty good too - they've got a good selection of beers and ciders on tap.
BurlingtonON,2v4cyt,szlafarski,2,Sun Feb 8 04:49:47 2015 UTC,"Most of these are pubs being suggested, so they may not be all that quiet, but the Martini House and the Downtown Bistro are both on the quiet side.  The Downtown Bistro has a really tiny bar, but very private if you can get a seat."
BurlingtonON,2v4cyt,PirateEyez,2,Sun Feb 8 05:12:14 2015 UTC,At Appleby and Walkers there is The Town Squire. It feels like a chain restaurant (used to be a Jack Astors) but its pretty quite.  At Walkers and Harvestor there is Rib Eye Jack's Ale House - which is a really awesome multi-tap beer place. Good food and awesome beers. Relatively quite too.  Dymond's Social Kitchen is nice too - but more of a restaurant.

Perhaps somewhere like Lowville Park (Guelph Line, just north of Britannia) in the northern rural parts would be better, and you might be able to find an area of the park without lighting, but even there you won't be able to see much. My parents house is on a dark, treed rural lot, and you can't see much, even though it seems dark. My cottage near Algonquin park has mind blowing stargazing in comparison."

BurlingtonON,2t45y8,LoudSar,4,Wed Jan 21 00:43:11 2015 UTC,We actually did have an offer but the developer backed out because someone from the other group of houses for sale asked too much. There are two groups selling their properties. 4 together closer to Seneca and than the 3 closer to Stinson. Each property doesn't know the price of the others. The plan is to sell to a developer to hopefully get a little more than selling privately.  (It's not on MLS because it's exclusive for developers. )  The plan for developers is to build some 2 Story town homes.
BurlingtonON,2t45y8,Kaylamfranklin,2,Wed Jan 21 04:02:51 2015 UTC,"If you own the brown more ""cube like"" house - that by far has been one of my favourite houses in Burlington!

Seneca and Stinson are by far two of the most beautiful streets in Burlington, we were looking in that area for a while.   I hope whatever goes up maintains some of the charm that exists in that area."

And the houses on the edges don't have signs up.  If you walk by some of them have flyers, sometimes. But I don't recall there being any prices on them. And each lot is sold individually, it looks like, so really if you wanted to build something you have to buy a chunk of them at least.  They've been for sale for a while though (although I've never seen them on MLS). Maybe next time I'm walking by I'll ask somebody if they're outside what the deal is."

BurlingtonON,2potai,Corsten,4,Fri Dec 19 02:52:34 2014 UTC,"For anyone interested in this development, I'd like to highlight the last item in the Mayor's post - ""If and when this proposal becomes official we will have a public meeting in Aldershot to discuss it.""  I'd encourage anyone interested to participate - The owner, councillor, planners (developer's and city staff), and usually the architect are there. They'll go over exactly what their proposal is and what it entails. The floor is open to questions so this is a great time to raise your concerns and get responses on how they will be addressed.   These kinds of meetings aren't prescribed by the planning act but are often held with large/controvertial projects to benefit all parties - It gives a forum for residents to speak, it gives the proponent a chance to answer and explain, and it helps the staff and elected persons understand the principal concerns of the residents.  It's unclear without more information if any zoning amendment or variances are required. I've had a quick look and the MXC zoning permits what they're proposing (6 storey residential) so it seems compliant.  Anyway, presuming it's in the cards, Zoning amendments and variances are part of the public processes - If there is still an issue at this time, you'll have an opportunity to speak at council if you wish. Keep an eye open for a board on the site announcing an ammending application, or write your councillor with your concerns and ask for help participating in the process."

If you smash 700+ people into that location it's going to turn commuting into a nightmare (more than it already is), as well as traffic in the area will only worsen. Hopefully this gets dumped for something a little more sane and rational."
BurlingtonON,2potai,Corsten,2,Thu Dec 18 15:24:00 2014 UTC,Plus that GO station is DESPERATE for more parking space. There are cars parked on the grass around the entire perimeter of the property all day long.
BurlingtonON,2potai,Corsten,1 point,Wed Dec 24 01:45:25 2014 UTC,Is the problem quantity/volume or location?
BurlingtonON,2potai,CarrionLuggage,1 point,Fri Dec 19 10:05:41 2014 UTC,"The problem will be volume of people at that particular location. As I pointed out, single lane roads in/out of that area. Now add up to 700 cars additional, and wait until 4pm and see what happens with people getting off the highway at Waterdown road, coming out of the GO station parking lot, and trying to navigate that space. It'll be utter hell every morning and afternoon. Yes, we're widening Waterdown road, but ultimately it dumps out to Plains which isn't getting wider, and onto the highway via a single right hand turn lane. Another 700 people living directly on top of that already constricted area seems like a terrible idea to me. Beyond that, who wants to live directly under a highway overpass and directly beside the train tracks?!"
BurlingtonON,2potai,Corsten,3,Fri Dec 19 11:33:26 2014 UTC,"I'm confident a traffic impact study would be required as part of coming applications. These studies model the trips to and from a site and analyze that against existing traffic volumes. You can use the result of this report as evidence for the need to improving roadways in Aldershot in further chats with public officials.  Secondly, it's adjacent to a Go station and highway access. If we assume 733 new units are part of the inevitable growth of Burlington, I'm hard pressed to think of what would be a better location.   I agree entirely traffic is no fun and new residential units don't help, but I don't think Burlington's going to cease growth. It becomes an issue of location, and the goal becomes convincing more people to use public or shared transit instead of individual cars. Having new development adjacent to public transit is great. Right next to a go station with daily service to downtown Toronto? Stellar."

BurlingtonON,2pb58w,szlafarski,2,Mon Dec 15 00:29:06 2014 UTC,Is someone from Joe Dogs downvoting all the comments complimenting The Poacher.
BurlingtonON,2pb58w,MonsieurLeDrole,2,Wed Dec 24 01:46:55 2014 UTC,"The Poacher burger is pretty tasty, and the bike racks are much appreciated.  Go get em boys!"
BurlingtonON,2pb58w,MAXMEEKO,1 point,Tue Dec 16 21:29:34 2014 UTC,i love the poacher!!!
BurlingtonON,2pbn6f,burgerlover69,3,Mon Dec 15 03:17:05 2014 UTC,I just missed the last one. I would be totally interested in another meetup!
BurlingtonON,2pbn6f,Ganglebot,2,Mon Dec 15 13:33:00 2014 UTC,A summer club for late night bike riding would be great too.
BurlingtonON,2olwng,1finewire,7,Mon Dec 8 02:49:58 2014 UTC,Just do what George Bush did.
BurlingtonON,2olwng,mattgrande,1 point,Mon Dec 8 14:17:49 2014 UTC,HAHAHA!
BurlingtonON,2olwng,rocks_rawk,4,Mon Dec 8 19:27:19 2014 UTC,"Could you report them to the city? I've had neighbours who had visits from by-law officers due to incredibly poor yard maintenance (like, 12"" high grass.) Like you said, 11 is quiet time, so I wonder if there's some formal complaint you could file with the city instead.   Or if all else fails, anonymously report it to the police as an underage party. I'm sure that it would warrant a quicker response from the police."
BurlingtonON,2olwng,dirty_birdy,1 point,Mon Dec 8 03:54:44 2014 UTC,The only thing the city might look into is the excessive dog barking when she's not home. I could report that also.
BurlingtonON,2olwng,szlafarski,3,Mon Dec 8 05:23:16 2014 UTC,Are you in an apartment/condo? Or house/townhouse?
BurlingtonON,2olwng,dirty_birdy,1 point,Mon Dec 8 07:25:24 2014 UTC,It's a townhouse.
BurlingtonON,2olwng,dirty_birdy,5,Mon Dec 8 19:27:44 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I would go over and just ask to chat for a minute. Introduce yourself properly and get to know her. Maybe she's in a major funk and the music is the only thing that keeps her head on straight.  Express your concern, but be sure to see her side as well. If things remain civil, surely an agreement can be reached. If not, that's what laws are for!"
BurlingtonON,2olwng,dirty_birdy,1 point,Fri Dec 12 00:27:56 2014 UTC,Is it in a townhouse complex or do you have your own landlord (i.e. freehold)?
BurlingtonON,2olwng,PirateEyez,1 point,Mon Dec 8 20:03:21 2014 UTC,It's a complex.
BurlingtonON,2olwng,Conte,1 point,Mon Dec 8 22:02:34 2014 UTC,"Is there some sort of superintendent or overseeing body for the complex? If so, I'd report the loud neighbour to them, in addition take a look at this page: http://cms.burlington.ca/PageFactory.aspx?PageID=10225&PageMode=Print  And also the additional Burlington official bylaw on noise: http://www.burlington.ca/clerks/by-laws/html/19-2003.htm"
BurlingtonON,2olwng,t0ast3d,1 point,Tue Dec 9 00:22:00 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the links, I will take a look there. We do have a co-ordinator for the complex but they aren't doing anything about it."
BurlingtonON,2olwng,marzoid,1 point,Tue Dec 9 02:54:11 2014 UTC,"I called a a bit ago because it was shaking my wall that joins us and I couldn't hear my tv, and the officer came to my door and said her music isn't loud enough for bi-law to do anything. Wow... that's fantastic!"
BurlingtonON,2olwng,mandanastudios,1 point,Tue Dec 9 03:31:59 2014 UTC,"Huh, that's too bad. I guess my only other suggestion would yo just be relentless in your complaints to the townhouse superintendent and the bylaw officers and police."
BurlingtonON,2olwng,marzoid,1 point,Tue Dec 9 08:02:50 2014 UTC,"I'm just going to keep calling when her music shakes my walls and then ask the officer to come here first and sit in my living room to witness it. I've had pictures, paintings, decorative plates all fall off the wall and break because of this."
BurlingtonON,2olwng,mandanastudios,2,Tue Dec 9 16:26:26 2014 UTC,"I live in Burlington now, but i had a loud neighbour when i lived in oakville.   I called halton police one morning when i could hear her music from across the street inside my house.  The girl i spoke to said that excessive noise at any time is prohibited, not just after 11pm.  Im sure its a halton-wide bylaw and would apply to burlington as well."
BurlingtonON,2olwng,ThisTimeTomorrow,1 point,Mon Dec 8 04:23:33 2014 UTC,"Oh, that is good to know! It is constant when she's home and when she's not home her dog barks. I'll give them a call when it's happening again to enquire. Thank you!"
BurlingtonON,2olwng,MonsieurLeDrole,1 point,Mon Dec 8 05:22:35 2014 UTC,Let us know what happens. I'm curious as to what the proper course of action about this is.
BurlingtonON,2olwng,thetwosandones,1 point,Mon Dec 8 12:27:43 2014 UTC,"You call the police every time they are a ""nuisance"". Time has no bearing on excessive noise.  Or, pour a concrete curb on your property line. Buy a concrete saw. Cut curb whenever music is too loud next door. Repeat."
BurlingtonON,2ogwqi,clocktimer13,7,Sat Dec 6 16:44:09 2014 UTC,House on Spruce Street. It's a holiday Tradition along with all the homes on Lakeshore.
BurlingtonON,2ogwqi,Chibey,1 point,Sat Dec 6 17:08:12 2014 UTC,There's lots of houses in Burlington with tons of lights but nothing tops that place on Spruce.
BurlingtonON,2ogwqi,dirty_birdy,3,Sat Dec 6 19:00:26 2014 UTC,If you park at John T Tuck you are right across the street from it. Lots of folks walk over with their hot chocolate! :)
BurlingtonON,2of2ml,coreythestar,1 point,Sat Dec 6 00:56:59 2014 UTC,"I haven't seen any signs up at the fire stations, which is unfortunate because I called them once a couple years ago and it was a wonderful service. I actually wanted to volunteer myself."
BurlingtonON,2of2ml,szlafarski,2,Fri Dec 12 00:25:28 2014 UTC,I did it last year - it was a lot of fun!
BurlingtonON,2of2ml,burgerlover69,1 point,Fri Dec 12 00:28:30 2014 UTC,"yeah if we could get some more info on this it would be great... i'd like to volunteer one night, and you know, maybe take it home another night"
BurlingtonON,2oaauf,Freaktography,2,Thu Dec 4 19:12:46 2014 UTC,Gorgeous.  Taken recently?  Noticed some great sunrises the past few days.
BurlingtonON,2oaauf,griebelking,1 point,Thu Dec 4 21:32:10 2014 UTC,Thanks! I took this at the end of September
BurlingtonON,2oajgi,Freaktography,2,Thu Dec 4 20:23:47 2014 UTC,How'd you get in there? Very cool!
BurlingtonON,2o6u8y,MonsieurLeDrole,2,Wed Dec 3 20:51:34 2014 UTC,Looks like no one can help you :( Goodluck though!
BurlingtonON,2o6u8y,clocktimer13,2,Sat Dec 6 16:40:58 2014 UTC,I seem to remember the Bistro on Plains Road having it a couple years ago. Would be worth looking into.
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,clocktimer13,9,Mon Dec 1 16:44:24 2014 UTC,D Hot Shoppe has some pretty awesome and authentic Roti: http://www.dhotshoppe.com/
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,the_doughboy,1 point,Mon Dec 1 19:53:47 2014 UTC,"I've been curious about this place but I have yet to check it out. Sounds promising, thanks."
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,dirty_birdy,1 point,Mon Dec 1 21:27:37 2014 UTC,My personal recommendation are the Goat as hot as you can stand it and the pholouries (Delicious savoury timbits)
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,the_doughboy,1 point,Mon Dec 1 21:39:38 2014 UTC,"Oh, but you have to pour the gravy over top of the Roti and eat it with a knife and fork! Not too hot though, when you can see flecks of Habenero in the goat, you're going to have a hot hot time. You still want to taste it.  Gravy on the side. Seriously awesome."
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,narfig_agar,1 point,Tue Dec 2 05:51:19 2014 UTC,Yes. Gravy is required. So awesome.
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,the_doughboy,1 point,Tue Dec 2 06:03:23 2014 UTC,lol  I had never heard of a Roti until two days ago and now that word keeps popping up everywhere.
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,psilokan,1 point,Mon Dec 1 23:07:27 2014 UTC,Seconded. Love this place and it can get pretty spicy if you like that.
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,tombradyrulz,1 point,Tue Dec 2 17:09:45 2014 UTC,This place is great! Try the pholuries for something different.
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,whoisgeorgesand,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:50:15 2015 UTC,I love the pholuries there. They are the perfect savory timbit.
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,the_doughboy,3,Tue Apr 7 21:04:19 2015 UTC,"Test Kitchen on Brant St is a new personal favourite. They pick a certain ingredient and make apps, mains, etc... based off it. The ingredient changes every few weeks."
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,w4mpa,3,Mon Dec 1 20:58:12 2014 UTC,"Two places come to mind: Red Canoe and Blacktree. Both have incredibly inventive cuisine, and the owner of Blacktree is really quite the character. Bring your wallet though, they're both pretty steep pricing wise."
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,FiveFootBunny,5,Mon Dec 1 19:22:05 2014 UTC,"Second this. Matteo of Blacktree is the greatest culinary personality in Burlington.  He once put a Thai-flavoured beef testicle on the menu, so he could ask customers how they liked the taste of ""Mai Balls""."
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,WildRyc,1 point,Mon Dec 1 19:37:59 2014 UTC,"I third Blacktree. Expensive, small portions, but truly exquisite. There really is nothing on par with it in Burlington, as far as I'm concerned."
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,dirty_birdy,1 point,Mon Dec 1 20:21:51 2014 UTC,Is red canoe still open? They were having issues paying for produce a bit back...
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,eandi,2,Tue Dec 2 02:08:41 2014 UTC,"I believe they're closed, for now, for personal reasons."
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,thinkgifty,4,Tue Dec 2 13:10:23 2014 UTC,The Alex is a small plates place that's delicious. Not normal for a suburb-y town like burlington. May not be abnormal enough for you though!
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,eandi,3,Tue Dec 2 02:07:51 2014 UTC,Blacktree is a must  The Alex does some interesting meat dishes  Becky's Coffee And Sweet Delights is not what it sounds like (sorta). They have the best Columbian food around. Top secret shit right there.
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,DrGrinch,1 point,Mon Dec 1 20:50:44 2014 UTC,"I haven't heard of Becky's, thanks for the tip. There is a dearth of Latin food in Burlington so any new options are very much appreciated."
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,dirty_birdy,1 point,Mon Dec 1 21:15:23 2014 UTC,Second on blacktree  for sure!
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,eandi,2,Tue Dec 2 02:08:12 2014 UTC,I just went to Rayhoon a few weeks ago.  Delicious Persian fare.
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,terryfoxrip,1 point,Mon Dec 1 20:45:19 2014 UTC,Awesome question!  It inspired me to try some of these neat unknown places.
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,RedShiz,1 point,Tue Dec 2 01:41:24 2014 UTC,"I have not been to it yet, but I noticed not too long ago there is a new Portuguese place across from Red Canoe where the old Adobo restaurant was."
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,tombradyrulz,1 point,Tue Dec 2 17:12:13 2014 UTC,Another vote for BlackTree! Also The Alex knocks it out of the park for me a lot too.
BurlingtonON,2nyarv,selinajane,1 point,Thu Dec 4 01:01:29 2014 UTC,"Not in Burlington, but in Hamilton - Cafe Zum Linzer  Its a traditional Austrian/German restaurant with schnitzels, goulash and giant drafts of beer in great atmosphere. A nice change from the usual pubs/bistros/big-chains in Burlington"

BurlingtonON,2nbeci,pauldrye,5,Mon Nov 24 23:53:32 2014 UTC,Yeah it looked like fireworks! I think it could have been a transformer exploding
BurlingtonON,2nbeci,l6harris,1 point,Tue Nov 25 02:15:48 2014 UTC,That's my guess too.
BurlingtonON,2nbeci,ArcadeRob,1 point,Tue Nov 25 02:19:29 2014 UTC,A friend of mine lives near Burlington  Mall and she said that a transformer blew near her place.
BurlingtonON,2nbeci,dober420,3,Tue Nov 25 13:44:21 2014 UTC,"Yup, saw it. I was wondering what that was or if I imagined if. I have no idea what it was but it scared me and it was really really bright."
BurlingtonON,2nbeci,Tubcat72,1 point,Tue Nov 25 01:09:25 2014 UTC,"I saw the flashes and I was on Fairview between Appleby and Walkers, so it was likely lightening. I waited to hear thunder, but I didn't hear any though."
BurlingtonON,2nbeci,I_live_in_a_shoe,3,Tue Nov 25 02:30:41 2014 UTC,I saw them too
BurlingtonON,2nbeci,rocks_rawk,3,Tue Nov 25 01:25:26 2014 UTC,I heard some hydro poles were blown half over from the wind near Walkers and Hwy 5. Could the flashes been from that? Some sort of electrical failure or transformer blowing?
BurlingtonON,2nbeci,1lIl1Il1lIl11lI,1 point,Tue Nov 25 03:26:22 2014 UTC,Power was out in rural Burlington until midnight.
BurlingtonON,2nbeci,Ganglebot,1 point,Tue Nov 25 13:59:28 2014 UTC,"I saw it too, coincidently when I was on the 407 as well. I kept waiting for the ran, but it didn't come.  I think it was a transformer as well. My power was fluctuation all night."
BurlingtonON,2n3b7x,LouisJoliet,1 point,Sat Nov 22 17:11:04 2014 UTC,You got to hand feed a woodpecker? Damnnnn. How?
BurlingtonON,2n3b7x,trolloc1,1 point,Sat Nov 22 18:52:25 2014 UTC,They are conditioned to visitors. In the summer Blue Jays and Yellow Finches will eat from your hand also. Unfortunately I've never been able to feed a Cardinal though!
BurlingtonON,2n3b7x,trolloc1,1 point,Sat Nov 22 20:04:24 2014 UTC,"I've gone there a ton! I have never fed a woodpecker, or bluejay. Best I've done is a nuthatch haha"
BurlingtonON,2n3b7x,tombradyrulz,1 point,Sat Nov 22 20:46:49 2014 UTC,For some reason all the birds love sunflower seeds. Try those if you haven't already. Being patient is also key. The woodpecker didn't eat from my hand for the first 30 minutes I was there but afterwards it was no problem.
BurlingtonON,2mac7j,t0ast3d,2,Fri Nov 14 14:39:45 2014 UTC,"Our neighbors got there roof redone this summer.    The workers doing it threw the removed shingles into our backyard, and the unused nails  We kindly dumped all this shit in my neighbors front porch."
BurlingtonON,2mac7j,dieth,2,Fri Nov 14 14:49:02 2014 UTC,"Just as an FYI. Roofs done in the 2002-2004 era may have had defective IKO roof tiles installed, this is only half way through their expected lifespan. My parents entire neighbourhood got theirs done over the summer as well as a few other similar sub divisions."
BurlingtonON,2mac7j,the_doughboy,2,Fri Nov 14 19:48:03 2014 UTC,"Yup. I'm aware. My shingle condition is nothing I would blame on them. They didnt make the shingles. They outright lied and said they were doing more work than they did. And I paid for all the supposed work and materials. No ice barrier, no tar paper, no repairs (I paid over $1000 for the ""wood repair"" alone!), etc."
BurlingtonON,2mac7j,the_doughboy,2,Fri Nov 14 21:25:49 2014 UTC,"There were about 5 different companies that did the work on 20 houses. The majority going to 1 company, they were the most expensive and in a number of people opinions did the worst job as well."
BurlingtonON,2mac7j,DrGrinch,2,Fri Nov 14 22:00:14 2014 UTC,"I'll plug the guys who did mine, Halco. They aren't as big as some other operators, but they are good guys and they do excellent work."
BurlingtonON,2mac7j,MonsieurLeDrole,1 point,Sat Nov 15 03:29:12 2014 UTC,"Plus like people think just because it's Burlington, they can charge super high labour.  Everyone is looking to make a big score buried in a flat feed that meshes labour and materials.  Like dude, I'm not gonna pay you $90/hour to landscape.  Good contractors are really hard to find."
BurlingtonON,2m81sr,MonsieurLeDrole,2,Thu Nov 13 22:17:57 2014 UTC,I know the YMCA has an indoor basketball court but I'm not sure if anyone uses it. It also has treadmills but no running track I believe.
BurlingtonON,2m81sr,trolloc1,1 point,Fri Nov 14 03:37:39 2014 UTC,"Yeah YMCA has no running track, but in my experience you can just go into the basket ball court and play whenever. I've played a few games in there. As for the running track, it doesn't have one of those but it does have a pool. It's the best time of year to get into swimming."
BurlingtonON,2m81sr,Some_Random_Nob,2,Fri Nov 14 03:45:23 2014 UTC,Cedar Springs has both (http://www.cedarspringsclub.ca/)  But it costs a lot.  And an annual commitment.
BurlingtonON,2m81sr,griebelking,2,Fri Nov 14 04:07:27 2014 UTC,Funny enough at Cedar Springs the running track goes around the basketball court!  After a year you can swap to month to month.  So only the first year is a commitment.
BurlingtonON,2m81sr,Tanag,2,Fri Nov 14 04:53:09 2014 UTC,National fitness on fairview has a running track inside . The gym is also empty 90% of the time which is awesome. They usually have groupon deals for around $10/mo. I don't think there's a basket ball area though. I usually just go float in the pool.
BurlingtonON,2m81sr,scottyxxx,1 point,Fri Nov 14 04:33:29 2014 UTC,They have a pool? Do you know how long it is?
BurlingtonON,2m81sr,ecatt,2,Sat Nov 15 17:31:53 2014 UTC,"Yeah they have a pool. I have no idea of the size at all sorry! You could probably call them up and ask, they are never busy."
BurlingtonON,2m81sr,scottyxxx,1 point,Sat Nov 15 21:59:46 2014 UTC,"Dirtiest gym ever. Most equipment doesn't work and the female locker room looks from the outside in the basement. I've never felt so uncomfortable in a gym in my life. It's empty for a reason. Be careful, National Fitness is Premier Fitness, who is known for their scams."
BurlingtonON,2m81sr,LoudSar,1 point,Sun Nov 16 16:32:46 2014 UTC,"I agree. It is VERY dirty for a Gym. The female bathrooms make me sudder - I think the changing room is pretty nice though, I like that it has a private large changing room in it too. I don't find the atmosphere offputting at all. I think its full of ""normal"" looking people as opposed to all the makeup toting pretty girls at other gyms - it's just not good for my self esteem jiggling beside them. I usually only see older women when I am there, which makes me feel reassured. haha!  It is really not a fancy gym at all, its very basic in terms of what they offer as well. Like, for example, if you take the classes, there are no rooms for this, its just right in the middle of the woman's old gym area. It's like a maze trying to find your way around as well - I can never remember how to get to the pool, an end up spanning all three levels before I get there.  The equipment is also fairly dated, I've never had one that was broken but I only stick to the woman's area.  What I HATE is how they don't have any water fountains? Like, seriously? I take my water with me now.  I paid for a Groupon, 3 months for $30. I think it's great value for me, as usually after about 3 months i'm done with the gym...until the next time I feel fat..."

The more calls they get about the same dog, the owners fine doubles, then triples, etc.   May sound extreme but this may make people think twice about letting a dog roam free."

Why not take your dog inside when it barks, instead of leaving it outdoors for hours upon hours. Why not get a yard with a fence so the dog doesn't stray and possibly get hit by cars (I've seen it happen and it's not fucking pretty!) Why not pay attention to your dog and supervise it when it's out and not in a fenced area so it doesn't decide to go off on its own. It's not my responsibility to take care of your animal who gets out of your control.   If you can't take responsibility for an animal.. DON'T GET ONE! Simple as that.

It was a common site to see packs of dogs in Hamilton. The only real benefit to that was less wildlife (such as skunks and raccoons) in the streets.   I'm glad they buckled down on that, I can remember avoiding certain alleys and streets because of mean dogs."
BurlingtonON,2ko8ql,carny666,3,Wed Oct 29 15:23:02 2014 UTC,I couldn't agree with you more! I'm not even a fan when I see cats roaming the neighbourhood. Some owners are just too lazy to take their dogs for a walk.

BurlingtonON,2kiyih,sudzy40,6,Wed Oct 29 00:56:41 2014 UTC,"The closest way I can describe it; like watching some one play that surgery simulation game for the first time. Ya know someone is in charge of what's going on but its obvious the patient doesn't have a chance.  The results feed display they were using had what seemed like random timing. So the banter between the two hosts was just brutal. Like a wheel barrow race with a one armed man. They'd start talking and it would switch to the next riding forcing them to change the subject. Next riding had two candidates the banter consisted of ""well, good job Joe. You won."" As they expected it to change change quickly. But it didn't, forcing them to ad lib more terrible dialog.  The results graphic itself wasn't sorted by vote count, as it would be traditionally with the most votes at the top, but alphabetically by the candidates last name. So more awkwardness from the hosts reading out the winners incorrectly.  They had a panel to help interpret the results. The one host couldn't seem to get along with them.

I didn't have my drains backup, but the entire street pooled in my backyard and spilled over the foundation wall into my basement. This was considered seepage and isn't covered. IT SUCKED HARD - but I can accept that.  The problem I had was with the agent. I'm new to home insurance, so I had a ton of questions. They're attitude was terrible. They were completely annoyed that I was making them explain all the ins-and-outs to me. Explain the product I'm paying for.  After each question they would ask, ""So is that all the questions for today"" in a tone that was trying to conclude the conversation. I had to politely tell the agent she would be on the phone with me for at least another 20 min. I then received short and curt answers with frustrated sighs. A few times she got super frustrated and said, ""OH! I don't know"". I asked if I could be transferred to someone who did know, but she didn't respond to that. Just kept answering me in an extremely rude tone. I also asked if it would be better to book a 15 min block of time with her the next day if she is really busy today. This was also not responded to.   Wawanesa doesn't want to help you, they just enjoy receiving your monthly cheque. DO NOT GO WITH WAWANESA EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE CHEAP.

Also I find this information more pressing than the information you've shared (and again I had to dig for this:   School councils are not even formed until the first week of October -- how is this even fair that the vote take place before schools can adequately inform the parents?

You'll see a sign and I think his hours are 11-3. The owner is from Quebec. He is a red seal chef and makes his gravy from scratch. I'm Quebecois too. This is the best I have had in Ontario. Real cheese curds and fresh cut fries. They only accept cash and I think a large is around $8-$10. It's enough to feed two people though.   He also has great hamburgers!

BurlingtonON,2f4gnb,Chibey,3,Mon Sep 1 01:21:51 2014 UTC,I believe he gets his cheese curds from St Albert which is in Ontario just outside Quebec. It's the cheese Capitol of Canada lol. They sell St Albert cheese curds at most Quebec grocery stores.
BurlingtonON,2f4gnb,Melraidin,1 point,Mon Sep 1 01:29:10 2014 UTC,Know anywhere nearby that sells these curds? For a few months last year they were sold at Walmart (St. Albert still mentions this on their site) but since the St. Albert factory fire I haven't been able to find them.
BurlingtonON,2f4gnb,Chibey,2,Mon Sep 1 04:10:28 2014 UTC,"No. I don't think anywhere around here does however the white cheddar cheese curds at Fortinos are an excellent alternative. Sometimes when I'm feeling like a comfort poutine, I'll go to Fortinos and grab a can of St Hubert sauce, shoestring fries, and the cheddar cheese curds. Takes away the edge. Lol"

My fiancé and I joined a smaller gym here about 2 months back and have met a lot of great people that way.   Also becoming a regular at non chain restaurants helps as a lot of the same faces tend to go.
BurlingtonON,2e1n1q,LoudSar,1 point,Wed Aug 20 11:08:41 2014 UTC,Well I was thinking of joining L.A fitness because its just down the road from me. I also like reading so sometimes I'll go to indigo or a smaller book store. I just find it awkward trying to meet people in a public place
BurlingtonON,2e1n1q,LoudSar,2,Wed Aug 20 13:00:48 2014 UTC,"Are you male or female? What do you like to read?   My fiancé tried to get some guys together to start a book reading club. He is a English lit major and loves talking books. It was hard to find guys interested!   I really recommend Trubody fitness. It's a smaller gym, you'll know everyone's name by the end of a workout and the environment cannot be matched. There is no ego (unlike what I find at Good life and la fitness). It's not crossfit too so it's uncompetitive. I was so nervous my first time going that I was sick and by the end of my first workout I felt like I had been there for years and everyone was an old good friend. Check out their Facebook page, you'll see the vibe between us members interacting. :)  There are aome awesome painting evenings downtown sometimes too at a bar where you are taught how to paint a picture (they give line by line instructions) and you drink the whole time. It's fun and a great way to meet people :)"
BurlingtonON,2e1n1q,Ifthatswhatyourinto,2,Wed Aug 20 14:36:11 2014 UTC,"Burlington isn't the best place to meet people imo, unless you're the type that can strike up and keep conversations with strangers. Festivals are a good place but people might be apprehensive, especially if you're by yourself. You could hang out at bookstores, you're bound to run into someone with similar interests sooner or later. LA fitness probably isn't the greatest idea for meeting people imo, most people come to work out, they are friendly for the most part though (be warned, lots of gymbros at that gym who like to call dibs on equipment and then talk with their bros while people wait).  In the end it's really dependant upon your personal interests."

Good luck on the wedding"
BurlingtonON,2dww6b,rr14rr14,3,Mon Aug 18 20:43:34 2014 UTC,Agreed. Kijiji is great for selling stuff. eBay charges money but has bigger market  Garage sale people expect cheap! You put $5 on something they expect to walk away with it for $2. Asking $20? They will offer $5. It's frustrating so take the time and try a few pieces on kijiji.

We also certainly did not have our roads cleared fucking overnight.  Seeing ""ripped up flooring"" and stuff it seems that a lot of these damage costs are simply because these people make a shit-ton of money on average. Get sump pumps."
BurlingtonON,2d1mhl,LoudSar,1 point,Mon Aug 18 10:05:20 2014 UTC,"A lot of my neighbours had sewage backup issues (Geneva Park Drive) and some had sump pumps. We had water come in our house through every level. From the sounds of it from the people who have been coming and quoting us on repairs - it's been unpreventable. Apparently the city has known for a long time about an issue with our homes draining right to the city sewer system. Every house on my street (and probably in my area) has buried downspouts. In 1966 I guess it was a good idea, but right now we have water seeping in at each spot.   Insurance also covers hardly anything. None of mine is covered and we're looking at between 20-30k with minimum damage.   These houses are screwed. Not only is the resale value in the shitter, but they have to worry about mold, repurchasing everything, etc. If that happened to me and insurance once covered 10k of 150k of repairs that need to be done this moment (you can't waste any time), id just throw up my hands and cry.   At least when we donate to these people, we know our money is getting our neighbours back on track, contributing to the local economy and is just a good deed."

BurlingtonON,2apr8t,terran_immortal,7,Mon Jul 14 23:49:27 2014 UTC,how can an event charging $22 for non drinkers and $35 for drinkers not afford staff to do this?   I mean im a little confused at how they are justifying those ticket prices without really advertising anything that SOM or Ribfest dont have already besides maybe a few more craft beer options
BurlingtonON,2apr8t,kevinnoir,2,Tue Jul 15 00:42:22 2014 UTC,They are trying to take advantage of the free labour provided by high school students who need 'volunteer' hours to graduate.
BurlingtonON,2apr8t,LionelHutz4,1 point,Tue Jul 15 18:01:33 2014 UTC,"I was really excited about this event when I first heard about it but when I heard about the prices, it was a deal breaker. I've been to KW beerfest and it's like $5 entry free for drinkers and free for non-drinkers."
BurlingtonON,2apr8t,AnonymousAlumnus,2,Tue Jul 15 02:14:48 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the KW beer/rib Fest is this coming weekend as well. It was like $6 for the sample glass and entry wristband, and only $1 to refill it. Much more reasonable."
BurlingtonON,2apr8t,SULLYvin,2,Tue Jul 15 11:59:30 2014 UTC,"OK, everyone calm down here, lol.  First of all, the KW beerfest is $5 entry because its in KW.  Second, it's $20 entry to the festival, not $22.  And with the extra $15 for drinkers, you get eight 4oz samples...that's less than $2 a sample.  I would love to see more beer related events in my city so I will definitely be there."

BurlingtonON,2apr8t,chucklz86,1 point,Tue Jul 15 17:22:31 2014 UTC,Maybe you can answer this for me as I've emailed the organizer and have yet to get a response. And can't find this info anywhere on the site. Are they going to be selling additional samples aside from those provided with entrance to the event? And if so how much are they?  Edit: Looks like I'm going :)
BurlingtonON,2apr8t,turniptruck,4,Tue Jul 15 16:54:27 2014 UTC,"I can answer!  My wife and I went to the beer tasting at Turtle Jacks 2 weeks ago and were chatting with some of the organisers about it.  Additional samples will be sold for $2 each (4 ounces).  They were also saying how it is all done electronicly and it's the first Beer Fest to use a debit style reloadable card to pay for the samples.    So if your ticket has 8 samples included, your card will have 8 preloaded with the chance to add to them for $2 per 4 ounce sample."
BurlingtonON,2apr8t,chucklz86,3,Tue Jul 15 17:20:48 2014 UTC,Awesome! Thanks chucklz86!   To be honest not having this info has pushed a lot of people I know away from this event.
BurlingtonON,2apr8t,turniptruck,2,Tue Jul 15 19:35:25 2014 UTC,"No Problem.  I can see that,  the website could host more information for sure.  It's something that needs to be passed on.

BurlingtonON,2a3m4i,burlmentorship,2,Tue Jul 8 00:38:38 2014 UTC,"Here are my thoughts:   Design's pretty tight, there's not a whole lot above the fold on my 13"" laptop (more on my main monitor). At very least I'd removed the padding-top: 52px; from #header I'd also shorten the height of .landing-page .banner-wrap Custom contact email. Currently you're using gmail (and I understand why) but it looks better if you're using something like contact@burlingtonmentorship.com, hello@burlington... it just looks better. Paypal Donations: Be careful when using Paypal. I've had them freeze accounts for absolutely no reason (""suspicious activity""). I've had a lot of success with Stripe. Mentors: Who are they? You have a number of photos but no bios.  Unnecessary Donor page under Volunteer section. This page (http://www.burlingtonmentorship.com/donors.html) currently looks bad since it's empty. I'd keep this off your site until you have some donors (being empty might keep people from donating, a lot of people don't want to be the first). The logo is awesome!   I'm a developer so that's where my view is coming from. I really like the site, it's quite easy to see what's going on. Great work!"

BurlingtonON,2a3m4i,In_Odd_We_Trust,1 point,Wed Jul 9 14:06:58 2014 UTC,"You may want to go over your website one more time and do a bit of proofreading. Just by quickly glancing at a few of the pages:   In the About section: ""(...) designed to promote informed career choices for (not in) today’s youth.  In the Our Staff section, under Kevin Kim: ""(...) I instantly wanted to be a part (not apart) of it"".    In the contact section you also mention an office location, yet I can't find any address or contact information other than a gmail account.   You state that your organization is entirely volunteer based, yet you have an ""Our Staff"" section. Will you or your partner be taking salaries as a part of ""Administrative costs"" or ""Running the organization itself"" ?  You might also want to look into obtaining your Registered Charity status with Canada Revenue, as it has a few advantages over being an NPO. A lot of people, myself included, prefer to receive donation receipts when making donations.   Good on you for getting started with your own non-profit though. I like the layout of the website and the overall idea for the organization."
BurlingtonON,2a3m4i,failture,1 point,Tue Jul 15 04:01:28 2014 UTC,"My two cents:  When you start a Non profit what you are basically doing is setting up a charity of sorts, that will at some point require some outside entity (person, agency, company) to participate. In order to entice that participation, your homepage should be a bold statement of some type. In your case, I would craft a simple ""here is the issue that faces my generation/the youth of today and here is what we propose to do to address it, and then of course introduce ""how you can help/be a part""   People like causes, and they like to be a part of feel good things (i am a Big Brother- why did I join? They advertised the need, and it triggered a response.    In business there is a concept of an elevator pitch. This concept is simple; say you are in an elevator with a stranger who asks about your cause (product, service -whatever)- you should be able to describe effectively what it is you are proposing/doing/selling before the elevator reaches the next floor. Your website should be an extension of this, it needs to GRAB attention, hold it, then pique interest to explore further. I would suggest that in the first page of your website, you do this.  Hope this helps, as a parent of teenage boys I agree that this type of mentorship is invaluable"

The aisles and aisles of parts in boxes now seemed to be reduced to a few ""Future Shop""-style aisles with a few things hanging on them."
BurlingtonON,292apz,museumsofburlington,2,Wed Jun 25 15:24:06 2014 UTC,2 & 3 look a lot like a hand powered generator that we had in my grade 9 science class.  The last one looks like what they used for morse code.
BurlingtonON,292apz,psilokan,1 point,Wed Jun 25 15:39:01 2014 UTC,"2 & 3 is close because it is a tool of some sort, but you got it with the last object! It's a telegraph key used for Morse code.  Here's some Canadian telegraph history -   In Canada, the first telegraph company, the Toronto, Hamilton and Niagara Electro-Magnetic Telegraph Co, was formed in 1846. The largest company in Canada during the early years of the industry, however, was the Montreal Telegraph Co (founded in 1847), controlled by Hugh ALLAN. It connected such centres as Sackville (New Brunswick), Detroit, Montréal, Ottawa, Buffalo and Portland.   In 1868 the Montreal Telegraph Co began facing direct competition from the newly established Dominion Telegraph Co and price wars broke out. In 1880 the Great North Western Telegraph Co was established to connect Ontario and Manitoba but by 1881 it had been taken over by Western Union Co of the US and was used by Western Union to consolidate the Canadian industry, attaining leases on the lines of both the Montreal and Dominion telegraph companies. As a result, for a brief time Western Union controlled virtually all telegraphy in Canada.   In Burlington - or what was at the time the Village of Wellington Square - we had the Great North Western Telegraph Company, meanwhile over in Nelson township they had the Montreal Telegraph Company set up, ""Sandy Fraser was Morse operator and taught in the village school"" in the 1850s according to Our Roots: From Pathway to Skyway."

They also have a pool, studio room and basketball court to use inside. There's a women's area, most of the weights are main floor and cardio equipment upstairs. Its really new and clean. The change room and shower area is also very clean. You can ask for deals too, like if you only want to go to that specific location you can get a deal on the fees so you just go there and don't have access to the other locations. The hours are great too and there's a juice bar inside. Its at Appleby and dundas. They also have guest passes so you can let a friend come for three days. Or I'm pretty sure you can sign someone in with you for the day."

The address is 1960 Appleby Line. The other docs in the building might be fine, I saw a cardiologist there and she was great, Dr. Mody. And if you ever find yourself needing a GI I cant say enough about Dr. Kumaranyanke (sp?) downtown! Everybody just calls him Dr. K but he has been an absolute lifesaver for me! Truely will do anything to get you better, and the front desk lady Shelly is great.. AAAAAND they have a sweet office dog  too hahaha"
BurlingtonON,25yd4d,rocks_rawk,1 point,Tue May 20 23:26:56 2014 UTC,"awesome, this is good to know. I was concerned that the whole practice might be bad, I think there is one at 1960 and 1900 or something on the Halton ""accepting new patients"" page."

They've only got locations in the Hamilton area right now, but I was in 2 days ago and they said they're opening a location at Appleby & Upper Middle soon.  They're non-profit, open 24H, and everyone is super friendly, so might be worth a check out once the new location is open!"

BurlingtonON,2567os,useful_idiot,1 point,Mon May 12 19:52:58 2014 UTC,What kind of line up would you like to see?
BurlingtonON,24ypu0,Calypsee,4,Wed May 7 16:50:02 2014 UTC,"Chances are they were travelling in that truck from Robert Bateman on that Friday. They decide that highschools are the best place to picket and shove their views into our faces, the impressionable teenagers, right? And the two girls you saw with the driver were probably volunteers from some of the high schools around here. As they stand outside the school, they hold up gory (probably artificial or misinterpreted) pictures of ""abortions"", they hand out pamphlets. Some of the volunteers are, in fact, students as well.  They do it on New Street, just west of school grounds so they stay there until our principal chews them out. Then they claim that it's freedom and all this bullshit and eventually pack up and leave. The police were called last time this happened."
BurlingtonON,24ypu0,WereRobert,2,Thu May 8 01:09:25 2014 UTC,"If the truck was going from Waterdown Rd to beyond Appleby on the QEW/403, they can't have been going to or coming from Robert Bateman. Not directly anyway.  One of the girls looked too young for high school. I'd put the youngest at 10? I was passenger at the time, so I got to stare a bit but it's still difficult on the highway."
BurlingtonON,24ypu0,Tamination,2,Thu May 8 03:09:11 2014 UTC,Nothing like making a difficult thing harder on a woman.
BurlingtonON,24ypu0,PirateEyez,2,Wed May 7 23:56:09 2014 UTC,"I saw the same truck on the same day westbound on the QEW, between Walkers and Guelph Line.  I had to double take when I saw it.  The pictures were horrible, gory images on all three sides...wtf.  Isn't this a form of public indecency or disorderly conduct?  I'm pretty sure I would be pulled over by OPP if I drove a truck down the highway with huge banners depicting extremely graphic sex acts or something similar."
BurlingtonON,24ypu0,PirateEyez,1 point,Thu May 8 13:14:06 2014 UTC,"Westbound?! That's the opposite direction. Do you remember what time you saw it at? (This may bust my theory about the three of them road-tripping to the prolife rally in Ottawa this week)  I have no idea if it breaks any laws. Does it fall under the right to free speech/freedom of expression? Or is it a distraction to drivers? What about children - we restrict them from 'mature' rated movies, but how can we restrict things like that?  I didn't call the (non-emergency line) police. It's so long ago now that there's likely nothing they could do about it, except for tell us whether we can call in if we see it again."
BurlingtonON,24w58j,turniptruck,5,Tue May 6 20:17:51 2014 UTC,"For me its the poacher before 10:30, but I like tired, old pubs."
BurlingtonON,24w58j,Tanag,6,Tue May 6 20:20:34 2014 UTC,I second the Poacher.  It seems to be the only place left that doesn't have some obnoxious band playing way too loud.
BurlingtonON,24w58j,bibowski,3,Tue May 6 20:43:21 2014 UTC,"Some people like loud bands. And its not like they play every night.  I've been out of town for almost a year now but Poacher, Queenshead, The Dickens or if you're feeling a little divey or after some sports Joe Dogs can be fun.  If you're looking for somewhere a little further north Pluckers isn't half bad."
BurlingtonON,24w58j,bibowski,1 point,Tue May 6 21:53:40 2014 UTC,"The Dickens is good for this, because you can sit in the lower area and still hear the band, but also have a conversation."
BurlingtonON,24w58j,bibowski,3,Thu May 22 02:40:33 2014 UTC,"If you're looking for the best selection of beer, check out rib eye jack's or Pepperwood bistro.   As far as genuine pub atmosphere, queen's head, poacher or slye fox."

BurlingtonON,24w58j,THISAINTNOPARTY,2,Wed May 7 04:12:13 2014 UTC,That's probably the only pub in the city I haven't been to. I always had this weird feeling about that place since it's right next door to a Stag Shop or one of those porn stores lol

BurlingtonON,24w58j,PirateEyez,2,Wed May 7 14:31:19 2014 UTC,Vacant I think. That plaza has taken a real beating. And all the old dudes hacking butts out front of the plow don't help.
BurlingtonON,24w58j,bibowski,1 point,Wed May 7 14:32:10 2014 UTC,lol... nice.   The plaza across the street has never been too great either.
BurlingtonON,24w58j,bibowski,2,Wed May 7 16:40:54 2014 UTC,"I don't think I'll ever go back to that place. My friends and I had a bad experience there. We had just finished a work shift and had a day off, so we head down as we live close (should mention it was our first time going here). It was a Wednesday night (we work 12 hour shifts.. hardly get a weekend) but the sign did say open until two AM.  We walk in at about 11:45 (keep in mind we do look young, however we all had multiple pieces of ID), and the waitress takes one look at us and says ""oh, no, you can't be here, we're closed."" And begins to shoo us out. I tell her the sign says 2AM, she retorts ""we close whenever we want"". There were customers at the bar, so this made no sense to me  So we leave. a half hour later we decide to call to see if it actually WAS open. We ask over the phone, and the person on the other end snaps back ""Who's this?"". Such professionalism. We were perfectly polite, in fact my friends didn't even get one word in before we were shooed out of there."

BurlingtonON,237bqr,DipteraDreams,3,Thu Apr 17 14:05:33 2014 UTC,"Another entry point close by is Upper Middle and Brant. You would turn left on Upper Middle from Brant (if driving North). You'll pass a little strip mall. Drive all the way to the end (maybe a 1 minute drive). Upper Middle will end and in front of it there will be a green meadow leading to the forest. Once you walk up the meadow the entry for the Bruce Trail is right there and you can take several different paths. One leads to an amazing view of all of Burlington, the other to Kerns, and another to a larger meadow. There are tons of little paths too, one shooting you out on the golf course. It's one of my favorite paths to take."

They are all downtown and close to the bars if you want to get shitfaced after dinner, which is always fun."

BurlingtonON,22pqgf,turniptruck,2,Fri Apr 11 01:07:56 2014 UTC,Pepperwood is a great place and my personal fav....amazing food and they brew their own beer!  Oh amd they might even have live music on saturday evening.  Also its nice to go for a walk out to the new peir afterward.
BurlingtonON,22pqgf,PirateEyez,2,Fri Apr 11 03:24:25 2014 UTC,"Dessert at Cafe Dimitri is good if you end up at the movies. That entire plaza isn't too great for an intimate date though, full of kids. If you drive and want to do the movies, the Oakville theatre has VIP which is 19+ and serves liquor, plus you reserve seats in advance.  It's supposed to be around 15 degrees Saturday night, you could pull off a nice walk after dinner on the way to drinks if you do downtown.   Is your date night time?"
BurlingtonON,22pqgf,eandi,6,Fri Apr 11 05:14:47 2014 UTC,"Canyon Creek is a steakhouse near Burlington Mall that has a great quiet atmosphere and excellent steaks for a pretty decent price. Earls is a bit more of a younger crowd with GORGEOUS waitresses, decent food, and a comparable price to Canyon Creek, located in Mapleview Mall. If you want a nice place for more ""ethnic"" food, August 8 is a good place, same with Pomellos. Bento Box is a nice place for sushi, but can be pricy. If you are looking to shell out a shit-tonne of cash, The Lord Nelson on Plains Rd. has some of the best food I've ever had at approx $100/person with appetizers and drinks. Think main dining room on a 5-star cruise ship quality.  Hope this helps. My gf and I really prefer either Earls or Canyon Creek overall due to the prices and the steaks. If you go to Earls, try the Bourbon Mushroom Steak. (Also, Canyon Creek has unbelievably gorgeous waitresses too... Better service too usually.)"
BurlingtonON,22pqgf,Conte,3,Thu Apr 10 19:10:12 2014 UTC,"Spencer's @ The Waterfront is the best ambience, view and food in Burlington, and is a nice segue to a walk in the park/pier, and downtown (several drink places mentioned by softmod are right down the street).  It may be overkill for a blind date (or if you're a teenager and looking for something more fun....it is a more ""stuffy"" sort of place), and is not inexpensive, but it is a very romantic place."

On certain nights (I think Sunday and Wednesday maybe, but not positive) you can bring your own wine for no corkage fee which can really help make a nice dinner much less expensive. Plus it's right down town so it's great to go for a walk or grab a drink somewhere afterwards."
BurlingtonON,2266yu,Pepsiguy2,5,Fri Apr 4 06:13:19 2014 UTC,"1) Game Haven on Brant and Upper Middle is decent for video games, the people who work there are really cool and imo cash is better than store credit which you'd get from EB Games.  To be honest the best way to do that is to keep the games and then trade them in when offers come up, but if the cash is necessary then yeah Game Haven.  2) You have a good amount of choices here: In Burlington, Conspiracy Comics is the go to across from the Wendy's on Fairview west of Guelph, but I am pretty sure their policy for buying is... not great.  I'd double check that if I was you.  There's a also a new one at 2446 New called Collector's Vault, can't vouch for them.  Then you have Oakville which has Comic Connection on 490 Speers Rd.  That place is awesome, I love going there just to look around at all the cool stuff they have.  Then finally there's Hamilton which has BigB Comics, another Conspiracy, another Comic Connection and something else.    This list is out of date but most are still around: http://www.the-master-list.com/Canada/Ontario/  3) I have no idea if anyone would even buy those anymore, I also can't think of a place where you can sell DVDs."

Everything from chocolate to sauces and biscuits and a real scottish loaf of bread. They also do pies and sausages!   As for the city besides spencer smith park, Bronte park is nice in the summer and Lowville which is not actually burlington but just drive up guelph line and eventually you are there!  Restaurant wise, try the pizza from Luganos or if you are in north burlington im a fan of a place called twice the deal at upper middle and walkers.  Indian food, I am partial to Kwality at guelph and uppermiddle its a buffet but also does take away and always been great. Chinese I would say Panda Express at Upper middle and brant is my favorite unless ofcourse Mandarin is an option which is a buffet if you arent familiar with it (dont know how long you have been in the country)   If you are looking to play pool there is Jerseys on upper middle between guelph and walkers or Boston manor at appleby and fairview  if there is anything specifically you are looking for lemme know and I can give ya some suggestions.. funnily enough I am emigrating to Scotland in May"

If you're into records, there's a record shop downtown Burlington called ""Looney Tunes"". Cool place for sure. Take time to go up on the escarpment and look over Burlington, and drive up to the top of Brant and Dundas or to one of the parks overlooking the city at night. It is truly awesome. On clear days from the escarpment you can see the C.N. Tower and Toronto.   Many more restaurants than people realize for all types of food downtown as well as throughout the city.

Further you keep your bin clean by using liners -- they're made of organic material and compose like everything else.  Funny thing about liners -- there are a lot of very silly people who think that they're bags that you're supposed to pull out. You don't. You tip and dump the whole of the bin and they dump out with the material. Or they stay behind and you use it again.

I'm not trying to be too much of a cynic, but when SOLD OUT keeps getting stated as some sort of excited exclamation, it seems a bit like a lie, no?  And then after complaining about the mayor being involved, this hilarious bit of irony-  ""The arts have to make it on their own merit.... ...Burlington built the Performing Arts Centre, to the chagrin of too many people in Burlington.""  Yeah, the chagrin was that it was taxpayers essentially gifting a small number of Burlingtoners involved in the arts. Of course it was sold on the notion that it would totally pay for itself super quick because it would take off, but instead exactly as predicted is yielding revenue far lower than expected.  Hosting the rare SOLD OUT film festival apparently isn't that lucrative for a $40 million building that needs a million+ contribution yearly from the city to not close its door."

At Guelph there is no reason for it, and by the new school they should build a bridge over the road if they're going to be stupid enough to build a school on a major 'highway' road. It will probably have a lowered 40 when flashing added when the first kid gets hit.

BurlingtonON,1uuwyz,lovehotbaths,7,Fri Jan 10 04:26:27 2014 UTC,"The best place to look is ontario.kijiji.ca and then filter by location, price etc. I would try to live closer to downtown (Brant, Maple, Hager)- it's a very nice area with comparatively lots going on. There are some apartment buildings at Olga and Hager that look alright. If you can find an apartment in a house those are usually the nicest. The condos downtown are nice but way more than they're worth."
BurlingtonON,1uuwyz,spizzak,3,Fri Jan 10 04:46:42 2014 UTC,How do you find an apartment in a house? Is that like the ads for Basement apartments? Coming from a state that can not have basements that makes me a little weary. Do you mind elaborating?
BurlingtonON,1uuwyz,chrisluyk,3,Fri Jan 10 04:54:30 2014 UTC,"I think basement apartments is what he meant, like you think. What makes you weary about it, other than the idea of living in someone's house? Or is that all. I can totally see why that would seem concerning. But realistically, you can find some really great looking and spacious basement apartments. They're designed to have everything a person(s) would need. And if you have a good landlord, it's probably pretty great. You'd probably have to avoid parties, though. At least I would imagine."
BurlingtonON,1uuwyz,spizzak,2,Fri Jan 10 05:05:00 2014 UTC,"Yes, living in someones home seems odd. Also how does parking work at a home? We will have two cars."

BurlingtonON,1uuwyz,vidi_images,5,Sun Jan 19 19:51:05 2014 UTC,"Do you have a job? And do you know where abouts it is located? I lived in longmoor terrace for a number of years before buying a house. I liked it because it is the only apartment in that specific area, so it's not too busy and crowded. Maybe that doesn't matter much, but to me it seemed like a slight perk somehow. The management was also quite nice and all my neighbours were good and quiet. When I first lived there, there were some riff raff, but they started to filter them out and turn the place into a nicer community. I believe plans were being made to upgrade all the apartments into a much more modern place and open it up a bit. I grew up in the area, so I liked living there.   People will always say to stay away from the Warwick area. Lots of apartments and rental condos. It was much worse a number of years ago, but I honestly would live there at this point. I don't think it's that bad. I used to work quite a bit in that community and I didn't really see any problems. I also have family that live in the apartments and it's always been quiet. Although, it's still considered one of the lowest ends of the city if you're going to rent.   There are a lot of condos between fairview and new street on Guelph line. Can't say I've spent much time in any of them. It's a decent location, but location in this city isn't really a huge problem. Everything is relatively close and accessible. I'd prefer to live in the south end of the city, personally. Just seems a little less busy.   Back to the Warwick discussion. The rental townhouses aren't all that bad at all. I've been in them. And if you have a few extra hundred a month, it's gotta be nice to have the extra space and not have to have neighbours above and below you. If that's something that bothers you at all. Really apartments are all shit if you have bad neighbours. I've lived in decent places where I had a neighbour that liked to party nearly every night all into the a.m. And it drove me insane."
BurlingtonON,1uuwyz,chrisluyk,2,Fri Jan 10 04:56:21 2014 UTC,"I will be working near Guelph and Harvester. My boss who recently moved there says he likes the Southern side better. He says it is not as uppity.   If I had the opportunity I would love to live in walking distance of a pub. Even more so I have a dog so a backyard would be fabulous.   We are looking to stay under 1300 including electricity, water and heat. If we can find a two bedroom or townhome I would be ecstatic!  I will take a look at Longmoore and the Warwick area! Thank you for the input :)"
BurlingtonON,1uuwyz,Bingbangyadda,5,Fri Jan 10 05:05:19 2014 UTC,"Kind of off topic, but a good pub to go to is The Queen's Head on Brant Street, across from Spencer Smith Park."
BurlingtonON,1uuwyz,Tamination,3,Fri Jan 10 05:08:44 2014 UTC,Very cool! As long as its a chill place with good beer I am happy :)
BurlingtonON,1uuwyz,AndruRC,2,Fri Jan 10 05:10:36 2014 UTC,Better place is the Beaver and Bulldog in the Waterfront Hotel. The back rooms and patio look out over the lake.
BurlingtonON,1uuwyz,Tranger66,4,Fri Jan 10 13:43:21 2014 UTC,"Yes, the north side is more newly developed. And developing. It often has very high priced homes with very little property, given how tightly everything is built. The south end has plenty of extremely rich neighbourhoods given the proximity to the lake, but it still has many older houses with with large lots and good character. Longmor, like many of the apartments is on the south. Btw, a pretty solid pub is practically your neighbour if you decide to look at longmoor. Couldn't be closer. I used to walk there for takeout too, cause the foods pretty good. Finding pubs around these apartments will not be an issue.   Guelph and harvester is a convenient location for many of the apartment areas mentioned. If you were to look at apartments on Guelph, you could easily walk to work.   The townhouses in Warwick are called Georgian court. A quick google search showed a unit for rent for 1400 utilities included. 611 surrey lane is what came up. Not bad given the city and  being able to avoid elevators and any other annoyance of having a dog in an apartment."

I'll be honest, many of the tenants are full of complaints, but there has been some major construction lately; the new building owners are completely renovating the entire indoor parking garage.

There are appartments at Guelph and New that has a grassy area in the middle that would work for your dog, but there are also a fair amount of park areas and paths if you don't get a yard.  edit: spelling"

I had friends renting a 2bdrm townhouse in the north end (with a tiny backyard) for $1600++.  One trick I used though when I was looking for apartments here, when I went by a building, if they had a permanent sign out front, I noted the location (easier to remember than a URL/phone number) and check it out on Google Street View later."

I'd second the padmapper recommendation, since it consolidates data from lots of different websites, plus you get to look at a map which allows you to look in proximity to your work. I was just looking around on there and most places seem to only have 1 parking spot.  When are you moving up here, if I may?"
BurlingtonON,1uuwyz,Ruckol1,1 point,Sat Jan 11 13:54:16 2014 UTC,I still have several months. It depends on when we break ground for my job. It is looking like it should be in May. I saw the one parking spot as well. We will likely have to shell out $ for a second one.   Coming from an area where everything shuts down if we get snow or ice... How bad is it to have a car without a garage? Is it super sucky or not that awful?
BurlingtonON,1uuwyz,Chibey,2,Sat Jan 11 15:55:39 2014 UTC,"Okay good, May should be snowless for you, so you won't need winter tires for when you get here.  Things only shut down here if the snow or ice is really bad. Did you hear about the ice storm that happened here over Christmas? Parts of Toronto were without power for 9 days or something? I was lucky and only lost power for a few minutes. But I know like, transit in Toronto was shut down. Schools probably were as well. But in general, a bit of snow/ice doesn't stop us here. I'd recommend getting out to a snowy parking lot with an experienced snow driver and learning how to handle your car, for when next winter comes.  Not having a garage kinda sucks. We opted for outdoor parking here (it's $10 cheaper). Basically, you have to get to your car about 10-30mins early (10 for snow, 30 for ice). Get in your car (if the ice is 2inches thick, this might not happen) and turn it on. Put the rear defrost on, and crank the heat and defrost everything. Then grab your scraper (we keep ours in the back seat, an extra in the trunk in our emergency kit (super warm blanket, flashlight etc) and an extra in the house as well), get out and shut the door. Start brushing or scraping. Have gloves and wear them. Once car is completely cleared off (roof, licence plates, all windows etc) put the scraper/brush back and get in. You'll need gloves to drive in, unless you have a heated steering wheel. They get real cold.  The time it takes to clear your car varies from day to day. There could be a foot of snow, or just a sprinkling. Maybe only some patches of ice, or a bad storm came and there is literally 2 inches encasing your entire car. Its important to leave enough time to clear your entire car... Too often I see fools driving here with a cleared patch on the drivers side of their windshield and rearshield. It's not safe - you can't see through it. And if you don't clear off the roof, snow will fly off as you drive and blind the people behind you. Or, it'll slide down onto your windshield as you brake and completely obstruct your view.  Anyway, yes, not having a garage sucks, but it's not the end of the world. Not everybody here has a garage. It would be nice to have one, but it's not so awful."

Here's my pain:  Google Maps is unreliable?  It said take the 10 from New St. to John St. Terminal and catch the 2 to goto Brant Street and get to Best Buy.  I took the ten to John st. Terminal and asked the 5 driver when the 2 would arrive since there were no signs around. He said ""It doesnt come here, get on mine and we'll goto the GO and you can catch the 2 there.""  so I went to the GO Station, asked him when the 2 came and he said ""not for another hour"".

Avoid the Headon Road area on Weekend nights from like 9pm-1am on foot, I literally have things thrown at me every time I go out during those times. Really, there isn't much around there anyway other then Pearson HS and Shoppers anyway (and Jerseys, my favoritest place ever, see 1) Want a game? There's Game Haven down on Brant - nice little place for the most part, and they're a lot better then the EB Games around here. Find a good hobby because it's gonna be a long boring haul if you don't man, luckily there's some good comic and hobby shops around you should really check out if you're interested (Conspiracy comics I've already seen in the comments, there's also Hobby Kingdom too however they really specialize in tabletop gaming and mtg) Burlington Mall kinda sucks, Mapleview Mall really sucks. It really depends on what things you're into should you decide to go to one of those places. Finally, if you ever want to go somewhere to have fun the busses and trains at the go will help you, Burlington's transit may be worse then your used to though, try to be a few mins early for the bus, With the Busses and trains you can get just about anywhere.

Spent countless hours emailing them and phoning them, never to get anywhere. After an hour of sitting on the phone while they checked anything they'd finally say they're sending out a bell tech and he would be there between 8-12 the next day, so I'd stay home and wait and wait and wait and no one would come.  So I'd call them back and they'd say ""Oh, it says the tech reduced your speed profile remotely and that fixed the problem so you're good to go."" Never mind the fact that they neither fixed the problem nor called me to say I didn't have to wait around. To add insult to injury they reduced the speed profile each time meaning by the end I was getting 1mb on a 5mb service, but it didn't matter because I couldn't use it.

These are just scenic spots i know, not sure what the specifics of doing a photo shoot would be.  Up near the cliff at mount Nemo is really cool. Or if you want the escarpment in the back ground drive up walkers line, north of #1side rd. Also Rattlesnake Point, just as nice. Behind the RGB building there is a rd called spring gardens. Take that all the way down to the bottom past woodland cemetery and you'll find a cool ""hidden"" spot thats very scenic. Or drive down north shore and you'll see a bunch of cool spots. Burlington Golf Club is one of them. Lasalle park is another. Hidden valley is nice which is North on Howard off of plains rd. Lowville has some beautiful spots. You can hike in from Blind line and its totally gorgeous. The lift bridge would be cool. There is always the old standby - village square. But personally, I think it's a pretty tired location.

Here are a few nitpicks:   I don't like hover states on elements that aren't interactive. It isn't a usable design. An example of this is the homepage column icons. If you click them they do nothing, so it's misleading that they light up when you mouse over. https://steep.ly/tea/ says ""Our Teas Teas"". It looks like your .hero-unit h1 needs a bottom margin of 20px or so. The text underneath is too close to the horizontal line of the h1.

BurlingtonON,1gepiy,jojodancer5,1 point,Sat Jun 15 18:28:19 2013 UTC,This is really not at all what I expected.  I figured it would be more like a Jersey or Atlantic City pier where little shops/food carts could open up during events.  Its far too thin to really be used for anything other than walking.

BurlingtonON,1gepiy,marcm6246,0,Thu Jul 18 21:15:17 2013 UTC,There was also a booth for the Accessibility Directorate of Ontario* just off the pier that happened to be closed at the time of the opening.  The viewing platform on the newly opened pier is not at all accessible.   http://www.mcss.gov.on.ca/en/mcss/programs/accessibility/index.aspx
BurlingtonON,1gepiy,but-I-dontunderstand,14,Thu Aug 8 15:23:42 2013 UTC,The entire world can't be made accessible.
BurlingtonON,1gepiy,marcm6246,2,Sat Jun 15 17:29:26 2013 UTC,"Seriously? It pisses me off that people are now onto the viewing platform bandwagon. That's just a last resort to get pissed off at Burlington about. It was never even intended to be a viewing platform (it was supposed to be a Windmill) and the view from there really isn't any greater than what you get from the pier 10 feet down. Also, give it time. They wanted to have it open for SOM, i'm sure more accessibility accommodations are on the way. Just be happy that it's finally open and not a construction pit for crying out loud."

BurlingtonON,1ff8ml,Calypsee,10,Fri May 31 19:45:19 2013 UTC,"The city is divided by the highway so there is a little bit of a north vs south thing going on. If you know what neighbourhood you're moving to it'll help focus what will be local for you. Regardless it's safe to say you can drive anywhere in the city in 15min.  There are a bunch of cool spots for good food scattered all over city. Everyone on here has their personal opinions about what they like best. Here's some of mine.  Denninger's on Guelph line has a cafeteria that has some pretty great food that is based around a German style specialty market. They have awesome fresh sausages. It's a great over all deli.  Zarkys on upper middle has amazing italian baked goods, prepared foods and grocery.  If you like Indian food there's (only) one Indian grocery store. It's on upper middle and headon rd. Best five samosas for $2 deal in the city. They have a takeout only restaurant next door which has good food and good value.  A real hidden gem is a little Colombian take out place called Becky's on Guelph line and mnt forest. They have deadly empanadas and taquitos.   Goodness Me on fairview and drury has all your healthy grocery/vegan/gluten/lactosfree needs covered.   Also the ""new fortinos"" on Appleby and dundas has really, really good food. Baked goods, prepared food, massive organic veg section.  The best lower cost vegetable shopping is at the no frills on brant. Hands down.  Greensville Gourmet on guelph line and new street has great seafood and meat if quality is more important then price to you.  These are all just my opinions, this is not a definitive list. Some will agree, some will not.   Anyway, let us know where abouts you'll be living and what you're into and the info can be more specific."
BurlingtonON,1ff8ml,turniptruck,1 point,Sat Jun 1 15:28:24 2013 UTC,"The new Fortino's has a Pane Fresco bakery in it. This is the same company that's downtown on Locust, one block from the Lake. Great food, just pricey. Used to be a fair bit better value.  Can definitely second Denninger's. Used to work there, meat counter, stock, and the barbeque/cafeteria. Great food, good value. Also the cheapest good cheese I know of in town. Only bad thing about the place: they stopped using what they called ""happy cow"" cheese on the Eggwiches. That was the best cheese ever for hot sandwiches. If anyone knows anywhere to get it I'd be thrilled to hear it. I've contacted the Austrian company that makes it (http://www.woerle.at/en/woerles-cheese-specialities/productdetails/kategorie/happy-cow/produkt/happy-cow-schmelzkaese-in-blockform/) numerous times but they only have outdated lists of companies that stock it from what I've found."

Thai/Vietnamese food: Pho Mi T&T on Brant downtown at the No Frills plaza. Reasonably priced for this area, great food.

Good portion sizes for the price) Lugiano's Pizza - the best pizza in town IMO The Poacher - amazing beer selection.

I'm in Waterdown up the hill which is it's own little town really - actually belongs to Hamilton but I so badly wanted to become part of Burlington way back when they were fighting over us haha.  And yeah, Alton Village is just a new, large subdivision that is quite nice from what I have seen. There is actually a small yoga studio/vegetarian eatery in a plaza in here.

Also, this town is pretty much dead after around 11pm if you're the late in the evening type. I know it sounds weird I'd highly recommend a walk down Upper Middle later at night if you ever have a chance, it's almost soothing due to the lack of anything other than a few lights.   As for food, we're more than good, drinking age or not pub food is fantastic around here and everywhere is great for their specials - I'd recommend Jerseys Bar and Grill on Headon and Upper Middle (Except say Monday or Saturday, The waitress on monday seldom pays attention and Saturday is always swamped) due to its decent prices and the full billiards room they just opened, The Black Bull on Guelph and Moutainside which is really well known around here, The Judge and Jury on Walkers and Mainway which has FANTASTIC FOOD, and Ye Olde Squire for its specials (And their award winning hot wings. As an aside, if you like small timey places there's the Harvesttable family restaurant over on Fairview by Walkers which has some of the nicest people I've been served by, and their food isn't half bad.   As for places to avoid I only need to advise against one - a little place called Carrigan Arms, worst food I've ever had, although from what I've heard drinks are cheap and the food goes down a bit later at night.  Anyway, this short novel should help you out if you like eating out a lot or just want a place to have a good drink with friends.  Cheers."

Don't sign a new contract or open a tab with anyone. I bought my Nexus 4 from Google and called Rogers shortly after and asked them what they could do for me because I can easily go to anyone else.   When you have an unlocked phone and no contract you can go to any carrier you want on a moments notice if there's a better deal. Most of the time your current carrier will match the deal within reason. Rogers won't try to match winds pricing however and I think that's reasonable as the coverage they offer isn't comparable.

BurlingtonON,1a6oyt,ptrin,6,Wed Mar 13 01:00:53 2013 UTC,"Lived in Burlington for the first 18 years of my life, still bus back occasionally to see family.  Two things need to improve.  Transit needs to change the routes they have and increase frequency in certain areas during high capacity times, certain areas have almost no use for transit, while others would benefit from an increased amount of buses, at least at certain times.    ***To any Burlington transit officials or planners reading this I will say this. Most of the people I know in Burlington SAY THEY WOULD USE TRANSIT MORE: if the design of routes were improved to reflect the demographics actually using transit, if the proper routes were used in higher frequency, if transit actually stuck to what it claims are arrival times and departure times (Buses are usually 5 min late or 5 min early, often more), and if price of transit was lowered (you are catering to demographics that might have a hard time putting 3.25 together for the sole purpose of traveling across town ie. students, the elderly, and low income families).  This last point of who your service benefits the most and who it should cater to should also be the inspiration for how to rework the current route system.  Stop improving the inside of the bus, and improve the service that you are providing to the public.  We don't need tap cards so we can pay you before we use the service, we need the services improved so that we justify paying you for it."
BurlingtonON,1a6oyt,LeviathanXII,2,Wed Mar 13 15:30:09 2013 UTC,It takes me 14 minutes to drive to work (Guelph and new to harvester and Burloak) If I took public transit google maps has it between 40 and 50 minutes. Theres no incentive for me to use it

BurlingtonON,19dn9w,Hitnrun7,1 point,Fri Mar 1 00:18:42 2013 UTC,"Yup passed first time. I'm assuming my perfect three point turn is what let me pass. Also my parallel park I asked if I could fix it, because I just hit the curb a bit."
BurlingtonON,19dn9w,tylertgbh,1 point,Fri Mar 1 03:53:04 2013 UTC,"Yea I hit the curb in the 3 point turn. Parallel park was just a mess. First time I turned the wheel too much. Same with the second try. 3rd time she had to walk me through it and I almost hit the car infront of me. That's when she officially failed me - she probably would have anyways though with the parking brake, blinkers, etc.   What pissed me off today is I revisited the route with my mother and gave the same parallel park a go. Aced it without even trying... Fuck. Going back in on March 21 so hopefully I have better luck."

Not too much on there right now, but both had lots of student jobs recently.  There's also the Ontario Parks website. I had a few friends work there throughout the summer in high school & loved it because they got to work outside all day.  The government also has lots of info on finding summer jobs. Ditto for the YMCA.  You can also check out localwork.ca. I always see a variety of jobs posted in the classifieds of Burlington Post too.  A few of my friends also did temporary work through Adecco when we were younger.  Other than that, I'd say just keep your eyes open for postings in stores. I know I've seen signs lately, but I can't recall where :(  I've also had friends who enjoyed working at Best Buy. IKEA too (just checked, and unfortunately they aren't hiring for any youth jobs atm). Also, this is really random, but I had a friend who worked at Pane Fresco (downtown) in high school and he loved it.  *Edit: Found an ad for Stonehouse Restaurant in Wednesday's Burlington Post.

BurlingtonON,16xqle,aatoth,2,Mon Jan 21 01:32:21 2013 UTC,Thai Coconut has some great food. Love their curries. Charcoal Pit is also great for Greek fare.
BurlingtonON,16xqle,shakeinthosepants,1 point,Mon Jan 21 03:15:27 2013 UTC,"Burrito Masters is such a good value! Definitely great for when you're really hungry. Sometimes they put out coupons in AdSavers, etc. (what one would normally dismiss as junk mail).  Mucho Burrito isn't bad either. Favourite is Adobo though!"
BurlingtonON,16xqle,bibowski,2,Fri Feb 1 17:53:40 2013 UTC,"Oh damn, thanks for the tip about the coupons. I always chuck those things out.  I only went to Mucho Burrito once and wasn't a fan. My wife loves it though, so I might give it another chance..  Adobo tastes like the most fresh and healthy of the bunch, for sure. Tastes like it's actually good quality stuff.  Other than Burrito Boyz in Port Credit though, Burrito Masters is the best."

BurlingtonON,132b4g,ptrin,2,Mon Nov 12 14:46:56 2012 UTC,"My comment is still awaiting moderation:   As I replied to you on Twitter, it’s not really possible to have an informed opinion on this without knowing the details:  “@RickGoldring What are the estimated annual costs of the private tree by-law?

BurlingtonON,132b4g,turniptruck,2,Mon Nov 12 14:58:13 2012 UTC,I'd support the tax increase if the program didn't include any expansion of city by laws. I'm all for education and assistance. But that's where I draw the line. By-law enforcers are drunk with power already lets not give them the trees too.

It's the busybodies who feel that they have extraterritorial control over other people's properties. Maybe you enjoy the shade from that tree next door, but your enjoyment doesn't give you an ownership stake over it (which, as we've seen in many letters to the editor, many people start to think).

From there the Trail continues into the Mt. Nemo conservation area across Guelph line.   Normally there's an entrance fee to get into Mt. Nemo but it's free if you're walking the Bruce trail. Maybe that's why people are parking there across the street?

BurlingtonON,vmhmy,turniptruck,2,Wed Jun 27 13:23:37 2012 UTC,"Good choice! Pomelo is a definite gem!  If you feel like some Indian food, Bombay Grill is really good (one of my favorites by far). The service can be a little slow at times so don't be afraid to give them a polite nudge if you feel its taking to long to get your bill. If you like an all day breakfast or a just a well made classic meal you can't beat Mount Royal Family Restaurant. The newest one my wife and I have discovered is The Purple Heather. They have GREAT food, a good wine selection and know how to pour a pint."

BurlingtonON,viih6,MisterMeat,2,Sun Jun 24 05:05:59 2012 UTC,"I think we should use burlingtonontario, but I wad wondering, do people get subscribed automatically to that one or is it manual? Also do you have access to the members here where you can message each one to subscribe there if it does not in fact happen when redirected? Also are links on this subreddit going to be moved to the other one?"
BurlingtonON,viih6,PSNDonutDude,1 point,Sun Jun 24 16:42:48 2012 UTC,My understanding is that links won't move nor will subscribers but it will redirect.  Please see /r/til for an example.  I don't have a list of individual subscribers but I'll post a welcome post over in /r/burlingtonontario suggesting people subscribe there.  I think there's probably a fair amount of overlap anyway.  If people are really concerned about links they can feel free to repost them in /r/burlingtonontario reddit is cool with reposts this isn't Digg or anything.

BurlingtonON,v2kwj,Martini1,3,Fri Jun 15 02:28:39 2012 UTC,I went here recently for a bearing replacement. Charged me for 1 hour at $69 instead of the 2 at $90 that Canadian Tire wanted. The mechanic was also very helpful and let me show him the issue in the garage on the hoist.

BurlingtonON,u0aq0,dacoz,1 point,Wed May 23 02:02:23 2012 UTC,"So I've called Cogeco and Tech Savvy and after installation charges and various monthly fees applied and averaged over 12 months, here's what the two offer:    Cogeco (Ultimate 30): 175GB @ 30/2 Gbps for $83.80/month  TekSavvy (DSL 25): 300GB @ 25/7 Gbps for $88.80/month    Based on this I would think the Cogeco package is going to be better. My only worry is going over the 175GB. Any thoughts?"
BurlingtonON,u0aq0,lightinthedark,3,Wed May 23 15:53:45 2012 UTC,"You're never going to hit the speed cap in real situations.  You'd probably notice the additional upload speed of TekSavvy more than the DL speed of Cogeco.  If you're only getting internet (no TV cable, etc), I'd go with Teksavvy; assuming the additional $5 a month isn't an issue."
BurlingtonON,u0aq0,dacoz,1 point,Wed May 23 16:32:35 2012 UTC,Wouldn't the cable connection be noticeably faster than TekSavvy's dry-loop?
BurlingtonON,u0aq0,malocite,1 point,Wed May 23 16:42:27 2012 UTC,"You would think so, but I have Ultimate 30 and I get anywhere from 5Mbps - 25Mbps. Mostly around 18 - 20."

BurlingtonON,u0aq0,eresonance,3,Mon Aug 20 20:39:34 2012 UTC,Teksavvy has lower price options. Ask about the ones that give unlimited bandwidth during off peak hours. Some will be slower speed but if you are mainly tormenting you can set those up to only run during off peak unlimited times
BurlingtonON,u0aq0,useful_idiot,2,Wed May 23 20:15:36 2012 UTC,Go with Teksavvy.  I am on their 6 meg line - 300 gigs a month - no metering between 2 am and 8 am (for all my big downloads)  the speed is more than enough for both my wife and I to watch netflix on separate machines.  If you need more speed their 12 meg offering is also very inexpensive.   You are going to get hit with overage charges on Cogeco.  There is no comparison.
BurlingtonON,u0aq0,Glenners,2,Wed May 23 17:09:14 2012 UTC,"unlimited download/upload  I've used Cogeco for years, have never had a problem and their speeds are superb (around the clock has always supported the peak of my plan. Right now 30Mbps, very low latency). They have caps, however, as all reasonable ISPs do."
BurlingtonON,u0aq0,malocite,0,Wed May 23 02:11:23 2012 UTC,"The 30 Mbps plan is currently at 175 GB/month cap (up+down).  It was at 125 until a couple months ago.  Previously there was up to 50 GB of overage for $1/GB and no charge past that, now it's $1/GB with no limit on overage charges."

BurlingtonON,jltbz,LuvBurlingtonTooMuch,3,Mon Dec 26 06:16:54 2011 UTC,"Lets be real, there are no good North Burlington bars... Have to travel down to Dickens or Eatalia"
BurlingtonON,jltbz,LuvBurlingtonTooMuch,2,Wed Sep 28 07:01:33 2011 UTC,TIL I need to open a descent bar in north BTown.
BurlingtonON,jltbz,bibowski,2,Mon Dec 26 06:19:35 2011 UTC,"I recently moved to north Burlington too (from south Burlington) and noticed a distinct lack of places to go. There are a couple of decent places, but are both way too overpriced (Purple Heather and Tin Cup).   Then there's the normal crap like Shoeless Joe's and East Side Marios (blech). It looks like I'll be going back downtown any time I want a decent beer selection while not breaking the bank too badly."
BurlingtonON,jltbz,jaydekens,1 point,Thu Aug 18 03:13:05 2011 UTC,"True, North Burlington is in a sad state of affairs when it comes to bars. Try Pluckers on Walkers and Upper Middle. A real mix of people (bikers, yuppies, hipsters) and not too many fresh off the golf course assholes"
BurlingtonON,jltbz,bibowski,1 point,Sat Oct 1 00:34:16 2011 UTC,"I've always tried to steer clear of that place, but maybe I'll give it a try.  I DID however manage to make it out to the Ivy Arms in Milton, which is surprisingly close to me (I'm at Appleby & Dundas). MAN, am I ever glad I went there. Tuesday's seem to be the day to go, with 2 for $8 pints (of GOOD beer), 55 cent wings (which are amazing) and a killer patio and 70"" tv inside for hockey."
BurlingtonON,jltbz,bibowski,1 point,Sat Oct 1 14:44:25 2011 UTC,"I've started to go to the Ivy Arms (it's in Milton) and it's DEFINITELY worth the drive. Cheap (good though!) beer, cheap awesome wings, etc."

BurlingtonON,jltbz,bibowski,1 point,Fri Jan 6 19:49:27 2012 UTC,"Do they have any good beer, or is just the usual crap?"

BurlingtonON,i1c4j,canadianviking,5,Thu Jun 16 16:33:55 2011 UTC,"There are a tonne of fantastic restaurants in Burlington. Further the Sound of Music starts tonight (and will be in full swing tomorrow), so awesome for you!  The Purple Heather and the Tin Cup are both fantastic non-chain inexpensive restaurants, and they're out of the action a bit (one up on Dundas and Walkers, the other at I think Walkers and Upper Middle). If you want something great, eat at Spencer's @ the Waterfront, though you'd run $60-$80 pp (and it would be impossible to get seats tomorrow). Otherwise there are the chains like Milestones or Canyon Creek, or if you want buffet Mandarin or a variety of Sushi all-you-can-eat places.  Burlington has no lack of great places to eat."
BurlingtonON,i1c4j,JezusGhoti,4,Thu Jun 16 17:20:00 2011 UTC,I really enjoy Bahn Thai at 4490 Fairview Street.
BurlingtonON,i1c4j,Annakana,2,Thu Jun 16 17:37:17 2011 UTC,"They've gone downhill, paradoxically as more and more Thai restaurants open. I used to be a huge fan of their incredible spring rolls and amazing pad thai, but they've seriously cheapened out and now both are pretty miserable.  Maybe other dishes have picked up the slack."
BurlingtonON,i1c4j,malocite,2,Thu Jun 16 18:11:33 2011 UTC,There's an indian place called Rice in the same plaza which is really good too.
BurlingtonON,i1c4j,eandi,2,Thu Jun 16 18:26:25 2011 UTC,"Viet Thai food - Ben Thanh on Appleby Line and Upper Middle road (just north of there in the same plaza as Canadian Tire.  Sotiris is OK, but expensive, and the food is very salty, there is a new place where Sotiris USED to be called Sokratis, but that food is punishment from God for past sins."
BurlingtonON,i1c4j,Pxtl,2,Fri Jun 17 02:13:31 2011 UTC,Big Tomato. Downtown.
BurlingtonON,i1c4j,DrGrinch,2,Fri Jun 17 05:57:02 2011 UTC,"Sotiris (Greek restaurant) was good last time I was there, but they've changed locations.  The old one was on Plains Rd, now it's on Harvester."
BurlingtonON,i1c4j,slice_of_life,1 point,Thu Jun 16 23:01:07 2011 UTC,"Best Indian: Bombay Grill on Fairview  Best Thai: Pomelo on Fairview  Best Quality Sushi: Saga on Fairview  Reasonably Priced but still decent sushi: Bento Box on Fairview  Wannabe Upscale with reasonable food: Earls @ Mapleview Mall  Directly beside Earls is Turtle Jacks @ Mapleview, which is also okay  Place with a reasonable selection of everything and inexpensive: Chaps on Fairview  Purple Heather is at least a 90 minute wait on a Friday and super overpriced for the quality of food. Tin Cup is a bar mainly and the food is only marginal.   I'm assuming you'll be meeting along the Highway, so Mapleview is your closest stop probably. Earl's is alright, I would probably hit that."
BurlingtonON,hse8y,slice_of_life,2,Sun Jun 5 22:43:29 2011 UTC,"yay! a post in r/Burlington. Its been awhile!  On a more serious note. Thanks for the link OP, This piece of information will come in handy."
