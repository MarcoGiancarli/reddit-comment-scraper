fulltvshowsonyoutube,3dl6ta,PopeInnocentXIV,2,Fri Jul 17 04:08:48 2015 UTC,Ahhh! I love this show. I love Jack Palance. His cool demeanor and flair for the dramatic really made this show awesome.
fulltvshowsonyoutube,3dl6ta,balanceofpower,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:07 2015 UTC,The Youtube uploader uploaded seven full episodes and one partial episode (I think that's all that would fit on one VHS tape). I posted two here but they weren't upvoted much so I didn't post the others. But if you follow the related clips at the end you can get to them.  I've watched them all now and now I don't have any more to watch. :( I haven't been able to find any other episodes online.
fulltvshowsonyoutube,3dl6ta,balanceofpower,2,Tue Jul 21 16:14:43 2015 UTC,Thank you for sharing these vids. It's a shame this show isn't more widely available. Would love to be able to watch the complete run again.

fulltvshowsonyoutube,3cmdsz,tvreruns,2,Thu Jul 9 22:59:26 2015 UTC,Your welcome I have plenty more episodes to add. Just takes time to convert them. Watch for more postings :)

The show was a spin-off of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, in which Harper between the years 1970 and 1974 had played the role of Rhoda Morgenstern, a spunky, weight-conscious, flamboyantly fashioned Jewish neighbor and native New Yorker in the role of Mary Richards' best friend. After four seasons, Rhoda left Minneapolis and returned to her original hometown of New York City. The series is noted for breaking two television records, and was the winner of two Golden Globes and two Emmy Awards.

fulltvshowsonyoutube,3an9xj,buckdubs,9,Sun Jun 21 22:06:29 2015 UTC,"All 6 episodes of this series are available on YouTube. Considering this was 1982, this show was years ahead of it's time.   Criminally cut short at only 6 episodes, this truly is a show that stands the test of time, and rewards the viewer upon repeat viewing, due to the sheer number of sight/wordplay gags crammed in to each episode.  A true gem. Enjoy, and thanks to the uploader."
