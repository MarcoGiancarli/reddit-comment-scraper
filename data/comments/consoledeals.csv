consoledeals,3da7cd,bongo1138,3,Wed Jul 15 13:47:35 2015 UTC,Yep. This has been discussed a lot before. And I have no idea why. Here's a breakdown before everything goes down in a tangent.  Some people would rather pay real money for in-game stuff they would like (there's a bit of a grind)  And others have the time to play and earn the in-game stuff.   Now why the hell would it bother someone how how someone else spends money? Their energy should be focused on other issues. I would only consider it an issue if an item could only be obtained by real money purchase because it's not available as a progress unlock. .
consoledeals,3da7cd,FancyJesse,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:02:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The only issue that I've seen is that because of the fake money, the regular game (without the money) has never gone on sale digitally."

consoledeals,3cplbd,SmilinGoat,2,Fri Jul 10 07:59:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah the strikes and the PvP maps are forgettable and there's much better weapons in the game. You should still wait two months for the next ""expansion"" because it comes with the base game and all the DLC so far."

You'll get Destiny the game, both The Dark Below and House of Wolves DLC, and the newest expansion. You'd save yourself way more money if you end up wanting to continue playing."

It's incredibly bland and has an extreme lack of variety and polish. I wanted to play it for the story, but couldn't even be bothered to. I worked at a used game store at the time and my boss let me take it home for free and for an unlimited amount of time and I still couldn't bring myself to play it enough to blow through the main story. It's an Activision game, which means it'll hardly go on sale for cheap digitally, so I'd say it's best to wait for a good deal on the physical version.  Hopefully Marvel will create a spectacular Spider-Man game now that Activision doesn't own the rights anymore and can't keep pumping out mediocre messes."

consoledeals,3cbmz5,redking125,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:32:47 2015 UTC,Are the strikes/raids any different?  Serious question; thinking about taking the plunge.
consoledeals,3cbmz5,PropellerScar,2,Tue Jul 7 06:08:47 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, there are 8-9 strikes now, and 2 raids. The strikes are somewhat tougher than the mindless story missions, but you can still play them pretty casually, and they only take three guys. There are weekly strike challenges that require a little more communication/teamwork, but they're still pretty straightforward. The two raids require teams of six, and they're quite a bit more difficult than the strikes—as in you'll need to look up a guide or have someone tell you how to make it through them your first time.  If you're still thinking about taking the plunge, it's worth noting that the first two expansions are on sale at least on PSN right now for like $10 each. Decent deal if you're looking to try out the next expansion when it comes out in September, since you'll have a character leveled for it by then.  Hope that helps a little!"
consoledeals,3cbmz5,KingOfCarrotFlowers,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:47:22 2015 UTC,"I've been out of it for a while, but last I knew, you had to grind through the same 4 strikes and raids over and over until you leveled up enough to be on the same footing as everyone else... so you could go back and do those same strikes and raids at a higher difficulty.   But that was a few months ago, sounds like they have 5 or 6 strikes/raids now"

I played the entire story campaign of Destiny and was able to do Patrol missions for a month before I realized I was hooked and decided to pay for PS+ in order to play Strikes, Raids, and PvP.

consoledeals,3cak6m,Falconfoe,2,Mon Jul 6 15:29:16 2015 UTC,I had the game before so I have the expansions I just need a digital download so I don't play the stinking trial the whole time.
consoledeals,3cak6m,Guesticles,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:45:30 2015 UTC,This is what I was hoping for. Went ahead and ordered it on Amazon for $30 new because it was selling to close to that price used on eBay.   Would be nice if there was a deal I the expansions though. $20 each seems way too steep to me.
consoledeals,3cak6m,ROFLBRYCE,3,Mon Jul 6 13:53:40 2015 UTC,"If you buy the Taken King edition, it comes with the original game, DLC 1 (The Dark Below), DLC 2 (House of Wolves) and Expansion 1 (The Taken King). All for $60 (I believe)."
consoledeals,3cak6m,Guesticles,2,Mon Jul 6 15:06:34 2015 UTC,"I just read that in another thread as well. I also heard GameStop is going to drop the price of the base game to $19.99 starting Wednesday, which is when my copy is going to get delivered. I'll see if Amazon will match it, if not, I'll return it and get it from GameStop.   I'll cut my losses on buying the base game and just pick up the Taken King edition when it comes out."
consoledeals,3cak6m,theginger3469,0,Mon Jul 6 15:09:54 2015 UTC,Why not just grab it from Gamestop in the first place and save the steps?
consoledeals,3cak6m,NeedMoneyNow88,2,Mon Jul 6 15:17:56 2015 UTC,"Because I ordered it on Saturday, and just saw today they're planning on dropping the price on this upcoming Wednesday."

consoledeals,3bvu72,delti90,2,Thu Jul 2 17:30:36 2015 UTC,I'm not even sure. I think I got some digital rewards at some point or something like that and they're expiring. It's silly; I don't know why MS wouldn't just let me keep it to spend at my own time.

consoledeals,3bvu72,AnghellicKarma,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:44:43 2015 UTC,I've always had a lot of luck with online chat reps. I got Halo MCC refunded after 100+ days. I showed them clips of me falling through the map and bullet lag that was not internet-fault. I usually use the fact I've had xbox live since 2003 and have been a loyal customer and ask to be treated as such if they want me to stay loyal.
consoledeals,3bvu72,nintendo9713,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:13:09 2015 UTC,Gift cards don't expire. However if you get promotional credit it typically expires on a certain date. You can find many of those on ebay. If the seller is decent then they tell you when it actually expires.
consoledeals,3bvu72,lumuba,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:36:14 2015 UTC,Ah alright. I was about to worry because I have almost $300 in my Xbox account from various trade-in things at the MS store and whatnot.

consoledeals,3bpsal,RevRay,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:58:42 2015 UTC,"I can't stand Nocturne. I own it for PS2, the only redeeming quality is the demon negotiation and combat in general. But even that gets tedious for me. Persona never felt like I had to grind, Nocturne totally felt like grinding with very little to care about. If that's your thing, go for it.  Devil Summoner 1 and 2 are excellent, but 2 is way better. They're action RPGs with very likeable atmosphere. Personally, those are my favorite games out of all of SMT, followed by Soul Hackers.  Not sure about DDS as I've never played, but it seems to be a fairly good and dark narrative."

But assuming you have it plugged in via ethernet it works fairly decent for actually playing the games. Plus you can play Vita games on it so thats a bonus. It doesn't include a memory card though so if you want to download titles onto it via PSN you'd need to pick one up.
consoledeals,3bltl9,AtomKick,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:24:47 2015 UTC,Is this really worth it when you already have all of the systems it covers?. Is netflix and hulu on it now?
consoledeals,3bltl9,CrossFire43,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:09:24 2015 UTC,"I only ever see people talking about it on here or slickdeals cause it's a cheap ""vita"" but if you one its probably pointless to have unless you like Sony a lot and want just to have it"

consoledeals,3bl2sz,tstorm004,3,Tue Jun 30 13:03:37 2015 UTC,"I like not having to change discs when switching games. It's nice to have almost my entire library available right there (I only have 3 physical games for my One)  I also find trade-ins don't hold value like they used to, so in most cases it's not worth trading in games for me. Which was probably the best thing about physical discs.   On top of that, with the One, the full game is installed on your hardrive even when playing disc games, so it's not like I'm saving any HD space by buying physical games, like I would on the 360.   Those are the main reasons for me."

consoledeals,3bbqn2,DealsPoster,3,Sat Jun 27 18:23:45 2015 UTC,"It's been $19.99 at Best Buy and a few other places quite a bit over the past month or two. I'd say it's a real borderline purchase at this price. It's a good game mechanically. There is just a few important things missing. You can't tune your cars for one. Also in each class the very best cars are always locked away as part of one of the many, MANY dlc packs. Seriously, there's like 20-30 DLC packs. It's ridiculous.   If you have PS+ there's a free version of this game available this month so I'd say give that one a try before you spend $20 on the full game. I got it for $20, played it about 8 hours, and then never touched it again. Project Cars didn't do it for me either. I'm still waiting for that one killer racing game on PS4."

consoledeals,3bbqn2,TravelingRomantic,2,Tue Jun 30 00:00:39 2015 UTC,If you have ps+ I believe it's free this month (ps plus version is different from retail but supposedly it's more or less the full game)

consoledeals,3awbkp,jusatinn,2,Wed Jun 24 10:51:31 2015 UTC,I don't even have a xbox one yet (I am getting one soon) but I bought this. Thank you for the find!
consoledeals,3awbkp,WilliamPancake,2,Wed Jun 24 04:03:32 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly fun game if you ignore all the hate. Plays a lot like GTA but with the hacking system on top of it. The story is a bit bland but still interesting enough to keep you playing. The multiplayer is TONS of fun, although I'm not sure how populated it is these days. Being able to invade somebody's world Dark Souls style and basically play hide and seek (with guns) is very interesting."
consoledeals,3awbkp,echolog,2,Wed Jun 24 12:34:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Ignore the bad talk about this game. I just started playing it within the last week for the first time and I'm having a blast, and you can't go wrong with a $10 price tag. Well worth it in my opinion . I play it on PS4 but the community is always active from what I've seen"
consoledeals,3awbkp,babaoreilymike,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:10:42 2015 UTC,"I picked this up when it was $16 a month ago or so, i love the game. No hate from me. People claim the driving missions suck because you cant shoot while driving.. but then that would make it GTA... people fail to realize that if they make a game too similar to another, they get called copy cats, if its too different then the game just sucks... they put emphasis on the hacking because that is what the game is ALL ABOUT!!"
consoledeals,3awbkp,echolog,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:03:43 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's a lot like Splinter Cell or Metal Gear Solid in that aspect too. A lot of people complain you can just take an assault rifle and kill everybody and it's no longer about hacking, but you can do that in those games too. You can also go pure stealth and hack your way out of nearly any situation. It's more difficult, but that's what makes it fun."
consoledeals,3awbkp,mrfreeze574,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:21:34 2015 UTC,Yeah its a game that lets you CHOOSE!! oh no! haha I love doing pure stealth though. Sometimes if I get caught in these types of games i reset the mission. im not fun to watch play video games cuz ill play the same segment over and over till I get it perfect.

consoledeals,3aon1m,ravenfan808,4,Thu Jun 25 20:59:57 2015 UTC,What's to stop me from turning in a PS3 for a ps4. Returning it the next day and repeating the process with another PS3?
consoledeals,3aon1m,Deathstroke317,8,Mon Jun 22 09:57:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's me being slow, but where's the gain or exploit in your scenario?"
consoledeals,3aon1m,RedTheTrainer,5,Mon Jun 22 10:12:37 2015 UTC,I think if you were planning on buying stuff at gamestop you could do this to keep getting 150 for ps3s while putting your own money you already planned to use at gamestop into store credit.   1st trip: 1ps3 + 250 dollars = 4xx dollars in store credit after returned  2nd trip: 1ps3 + 250 dollars = 4xx dollars in store credit after returned  together this yields around 8xx dollars where xx being dollars in the 800 realm for the actual cost of around 500 of your own dollars depending on tax for gamestop purchases. If you were to buy amazon gift cards itd be essentially you getting 300 dollars free for putting 500 something of your own dollars in.
consoledeals,3aon1m,ravenfan808,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:21:52 2015 UTC,Are you not able to just return an unopened item for cash?

consoledeals,3aon1m,ravenfan808,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:29:23 2015 UTC,Well as long as I don't lose the receipt between the day I buy the ps4 and when I return it the next day would I be able to just trade in a PS3 for the 150 and then return the ps4 for cash the next day?
consoledeals,3aon1m,sad_xbox,2,Mon Jun 22 12:40:20 2015 UTC,they aren't going to give you the store credit as cash. your receipt will indicate the amount of credit you got.
consoledeals,3aon1m,CardboardDoom,2,Mon Jun 22 16:22:45 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I believe that for the $150 you get in credit towards would have to be refunded as store credit, but the remaining money could be cash. Not 100% on that though"
consoledeals,3aon1m,Deathstroke317,0,Mon Jun 22 15:00:10 2015 UTC,Man you really thought this shit out didn't you?
consoledeals,3aon1m,ravenfan808,0,Mon Jun 22 10:28:31 2015 UTC,Essentially using the trade in offer twice and only paying 100 dollars out of pocket for the ps4.
consoledeals,3aon1m,Deathstroke317,2,Mon Jun 22 10:54:58 2015 UTC,"So can I stack? Or will it be ""depending on the store"" as usual."
consoledeals,3aon1m,Peatah,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:14:19 2015 UTC,I heard people saying that the last time GS ran this promo you couldn't stack two of the same console but they were able to do one of each towards a purchase (ie. $300 of credit towards a ps4 or x1). So obviously ymmv.
consoledeals,3aon1m,kahrido,2,Mon Jun 22 15:44:21 2015 UTC,Does it have to be 250 gb ? Anyone know if they will go a little bit less for a 60gb ?
consoledeals,3aon1m,landon34,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"It does have to be 250GB. If you click the link and click the ""find value for consoles"" link near the top you can find out what they'll give you for it -- I think it's only about $20-$40 unfortunately.  However, if you're looking to trade up to an xbox one you should check out the trade in deals at the Microsoft store they'll give you $100 credit for trading in a 60GB xbox 360. (And I think you can get the free game deal they're currently offering too!)

consoledeals,3aon1m,HeckleMonster,2,Thu Jun 25 14:50:40 2015 UTC,I know it says offers can't be combined but their online ad has the 150$ trade promo with a picture of an Xbox and above the Xbox it talks about the free game.

consoledeals,3aon1m,HeckleMonster,2,Mon Jun 22 20:28:13 2015 UTC,For real? Yeah it's the official Microsoft 250GB internal HDD.
consoledeals,3aon1m,Godofallu,2,Mon Jun 22 23:42:05 2015 UTC,Yep. I just traded in exactly that. 4gb slim with a 250 internal hard drive I installed myself.
consoledeals,3aon1m,LukeBanjomin,2,Tue Jun 23 00:39:05 2015 UTC,Did they check to see if it was an official Microsoft drive?  I wonder if it will work with a non-microsoft brand
consoledeals,3aon1m,therealstupid,2,Tue Jun 23 01:34:14 2015 UTC,"Mine was not ""official"" and it worked fine. They opened up the hard drive cover and looked at the little tag (which says 250GB) and that was about it (other than powering it on). So I'd say you should be fine but certainly  mileage may vary from store to store."

It's great thus far, only down side was the extra power brick (small one) and I just moved some plugs around on the power strip. With games like Halo MCC taking up 70gb it's getting crazy on the smallish internal HDD.  Also, the 4tb HDD is $130 right now @BB."
consoledeals,3a39xs,nomad113,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:24:35 2015 UTC,I got a 2tb because they dont require the power wire. Depending on how many games you have you may want to switch to something smaller like me. If you leave the hard drive plugged in and dont turn it off manually than the drive will constantly spin and itll die very fast.

consoledeals,3a1amk,ajpearman9,3,Tue Jun 16 13:58:32 2015 UTC,"Well its on sale for $45, so for those who don't want to wait its a pretty good deal, sure you'll have to buy The Taken King when it comes out.  I would def consider this more of a niche deal because of The Taken King deal you can get; others who love to collect, will want to get this because of the Ghost Shell, Ship, and Emblem you can get from this set if you didn't buy it on launch day."
consoledeals,3a1amk,JustMy2Centences,4,Tue Jun 16 14:04:27 2015 UTC,$25 difference to play for three months and build your characters before The Taken King. I'm sure a few people would look into it.
consoledeals,3a1amk,callthewambulance,3,Tue Jun 16 18:01:08 2015 UTC,Can somebody explain what all this includes? I'm thinking about picking it up but I don't really know much about the game right now. Is the game much different from when it originally released?
consoledeals,3a1amk,callthewambulance,3,Tue Jun 16 19:50:09 2015 UTC,"To add to my last comment, this means you will spend an additional $40 minimum for The Taken King when it comes out in September."
consoledeals,3a1amk,SludgieP,3,Tue Jun 16 20:00:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Yeah I did take that into consideration. Money isn't a huge issue since I'm 27 and work full-time (fun is always my biggest factor), but I'm just trying to decide how much I would enjoy it. When I (briefly) had it on PS4 I had some trouble getting into it, but it sounds like it has changed a lot."
consoledeals,3a1amk,SludgieP,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:02:59 2015 UTC,"Its a lot of fun now, I've always enjoyed it since day one, but the changes that came with House of Wolves expansion have been positively accepted by the community. You still have to grind for some things, just not as hard as it used to be; hitting the max level of 34 now is a lot easier."
consoledeals,3a1amk,tifugod,2,Tue Jun 16 20:06:21 2015 UTC,"How so? I'm interested.   I had a level 28 Titan about a month after the game released, and then three of my friends decided it would be fun to delete and block me, so I put it down after that. I tried a little to run the first Raid, but could never get enough people at the same time.   I haven't played since October."
consoledeals,3a1amk,Sincitysir1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:59:55 2015 UTC,"Oh man, where to start...  Since you've played, they've made it a lot easier to hit the max light level. You can hit level 32 with just straight up new vendor gear, and then lvl 34 can be had by using the new Etheric Light to ""ascend"" your current gear or any gear you have that's legendary. You can also play the Prison of Elders on lvl 32 which gets you an Armor Core which you use to buy the new end game armor which is maxed out when you buy it. So you can simply do just PoE lvl 32 to get the Armor Cores each week and buy the gear that's sold and hit lvl 34 (max light level).  The raids are still relevant because you can now trade in the shards and energies for different materials at The Speaker in the Tower.  The new weapons and gear are a nice refresh; and the new weapons can be reforged just like the Iron Banner weapons can.  The new missions for House of Wolves are pretty cool as well as the new strike.  If you get this, hit me up on Xbox Live and I'll gladly run some stuff with you."
consoledeals,3a1amk,Sincitysir1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:48:50 2015 UTC,"Dang, sounds like they did some work on the game then. I remember the last I played, you couldn't get passed level 28 without playing the Raid, and the Vex Mythoclast was ridiculous in PvP.   Did some looking, and I might pick up that Taken King Collectors edition when it drops. I've still got a shit ton of games sitting on my shelf that I need to play yet. I have games dating back to Wolfenstein that I barely have played. Hell, I bought Alien Isolation and The Evil Within and haven't even put the disc in yet.  If I remember, i'll either add you later or when I get it in September if you don't mind. I got a friend on Xbox that has Destiny, I don't think he plays it with anyone though. He'd probably be happy to jump in too."
consoledeals,3a1amk,Sincitysir1,2,Wed Jun 17 23:53:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was way harder to hit level 30 back in those days. Vex still wrecks, but its been balanced a little more and other weapons can finally compete with it.  And yeah, Destiny is my crack, I have other games but can't play them for more than an hour a week before I just pop Destiny back in lol. And yeah, if you remember this post in September hit me up and I'll add you."
consoledeals,3a1amk,Sincitysir1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:02:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen any major changes. House of Wolves is PVP oriented, but I wouldn't say it's a game-changer. There's very little new PVE content. The basic grind-loot equation is still there & isn't changing anytime soon. If you didn't like it earlier I honestly can't see how you would like it now."
consoledeals,3a1amk,Masterofunlocking1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:09:29 2015 UTC,"The game is pretty different, lots of updates and the recent expansion, House of Wolves, added things that the community wanted.

consoledeals,39wqb0,Otharsis,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:08:33 2015 UTC,They probably will test to see if it powers on. I'm still waiting on my 250gb drive to get here before taking it in. Probably won't be until Friday.
consoledeals,39wqb0,parisjackson2,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:49:49 2015 UTC,They did test to see if it powers on. See my UPDATE 2 at the top
consoledeals,39wqb0,mnsportsgeek,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:20:43 2015 UTC,"I know this deal is about to expire, but I just did it yesterday and you actually don't need a 250gb hard drive on it.  I actually had the old 20gb Xbox 360.  They still give you the $75 coupon and then I got a $28 gift card instead.    If you read the fine print of the deal (go to their weekly ad to find it) it says you get the coupon with ANY xbox 360, and if you have the 250gb hard drive you're guaranteed a $100 gift card."
consoledeals,39wqb0,Mofovader,2,Thu Jun 18 11:08:17 2015 UTC,"For the people posting unsubstantiated crap about the deal having expired, this is from the BestBuy website directly:  Receive $175 toward an Xbox One console when you trade in a working Xbox 360 250GB or Sony PS3 Slim console at a participating Best Buy store.  Valid 6/14/15–6/20/15. In store only.  So feel free to trade in those 360s you were hoarding and enjoy your backwards compatibility ;)  As for whether or not they'll accept it, my old roommate had the Arcade 360 and upgraded the HDD. They accepted it just fine. You may need to try a few stores if they get particular, but you should find one willing to take it."
consoledeals,39wqb0,tigershark627,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:54:09 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely correct! I called my local best buy and told them it was an arcade model with an upgraded 250gb HDD and they said ""You qualify!"". I am having a 250gb hdd shipped to me as we speak! As they only go for like $35. Totally worth it if this all works out! Will report back when I get the HDD and take it in. Also, the promotion is ONLY until Saturday  (6/20) at close, so don't miss out!"
consoledeals,39wqb0,ThisNilla,2,Tue Jun 16 13:05:13 2015 UTC,i did this today. I took my 20GB drive off my original 360 put a new 250 on and got the deal. No hassles.

consoledeals,39wqb0,ThisNilla,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:50:44 2015 UTC,It's extremely vague :). That's why I'm wondering who has tried this and/or who has found more info on the conditions.
consoledeals,39wqb0,tigershark627,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:04:40 2015 UTC,I did the trade today with a Super Slim 250gb. The associate didn't even pull the PS3 out the box. He just scanned the box and it came up as a PS3 Slim. I believe I got extremely lucky because from what I was hearing the super slim isn't part of the deal.  Friend just traded in a Super Slim as well today so they are included.
consoledeals,39wqb0,beepboopwooo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:33:18 2015 UTC,It's supposed to be ANY slim model for ps3 and ANY 360 model (provided the 360 has a 250GB hdd). The system also has to power on. That's it..

consoledeals,39snxh,DealsPoster,6,Sun Jun 14 11:14:21 2015 UTC,"This game is absolutely drowned in content. There is a ton of replayability due to just the nature of the game along with pvp, and a co op multiplayer system. They also added randomized dungeons to the game. There is a lot of depth but its a lot more digestable than other games in the souls formula. The combat system adds a new challenge but incredibly precise doging and movement. Very welcoming to those looking to get into the souls franchise."

consoledeals,39oxl2,DealsPoster,3,Sat Jun 13 10:03:16 2015 UTC,I would be cautious of buying the old controller when the new one is around the corner. It is supposed to have better bumpers and also contains a 3.5mm audio jack so no connector for headsets is necessary.

consoledeals,39f3p9,ActualButt,2,Thu Jun 11 13:24:31 2015 UTC,At 15 bucks I would buy this game. I regret buying the digital copy for 60 bucks. Nowhere near that much to me considering how pieced together I felt the campaign was.
consoledeals,39f3p9,GaussBoss,3,Thu Jun 11 16:23:22 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion, but the story doesn't make Destiny. The endgame content and the replayabilty are what really make the game shine"

consoledeals,39f3p9,ShifflesO_O,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:18:14 2015 UTC,That is not an entirely correct statement. You aren't able to play them when the content of the week is from the DLC which was announced with the release of the game.
consoledeals,39f3p9,Spinalfailed,2,Sat Jun 13 01:40:49 2015 UTC,That still doesn't change the fact that there is a paywall. If you don't mind do you have a source from Bungie where they did announce that at release?
consoledeals,39f3p9,ShifflesO_O,2,Sat Jun 13 03:04:34 2015 UTC,I agree. I've never played a game with so little content in the main game that costed 60$.
consoledeals,39f3p9,SharkieshasMom,-1,Mon Jun 15 03:52:03 2015 UTC,"You bought a game that from the start said they were consistently releasing DLC content.  Did you seriously think that you'd have access to all the features without paying for them?

So let me get this straight with what you're saying. I should pay $20 for Dark below and $20 more for House of wolves or buy a season pass( Which doesn't even cover THEIR THIRD DLC that they'll release) in order to play the weekly Heroic/Stike and night fall that they already had some set at base game?"

consoledeals,39f3p9,vonDriessen,2,Thu Jun 11 13:10:52 2015 UTC,"This is a great price for just the base game. If you end up liking that, you'd have to purchase the expansions to catch up with the rest of the end game though. There are still lots of people playing, with or without the expansions though."
consoledeals,39f3p9,wasabipeaz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:39:58 2015 UTC,I got it about a week ago (price match at Walmart for Amazon's going price of $20) and am enjoying it. I've been talking with people in Snoonet's #DestinyTheGame IRC channel and talking about playing together once I finish the campaign and level up. I think you can still get into it if I can.
consoledeals,39f3p9,TheoryofYou,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:10:11 2015 UTC,"No. But you will need to buy the expansions to do stuff with the current community, so figure it is really a full price game ($15 + $35 for the season pass).  Basically The Dark Below is a PvE oriented expansion, and House of Wolves is more PvP oriented. But the community is fairly mature, so most people are going to be doing the higher level stuff, so you will really need at least HoW."

consoledeals,391179,DealsPoster,2,Mon Jun 8 13:46:08 2015 UTC,"Bought this game a couple weeks ago when it was $16, it was totally worth it. If you like stealthy 3rd person shooters, this one is for you. If you like 3rd person shooters thats full blown shootout, this game is also for you. You can do both."
consoledeals,391179,Fjdijtsk,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:12:44 2015 UTC,"I've never had less fun in a game. There's no sense of exploration, there's tons of insta-fail steal, and the driving missions are completely broken; you can only run into the fleeing enemies' cars over and over since there's no way to shoot. I would be ashamed to release a game with such obviously unfinished gameplay. It plays like a museum exhibit.  Bought it for $15 used, sold it for the same. Just wasn't even worth my time."
consoledeals,391179,Fjdijtsk,3,Mon Jun 8 17:34:35 2015 UTC,I've never had an issue with insta-fail. Also if you are having a hard time taking down other cars you probably didn't spend your skill points wisely. There is an entire hacking section dedicated to car chases.   Tbh sounds like you don't know what you're talking about.
consoledeals,391179,CraziBoi94,0,Mon Jun 8 18:04:11 2015 UTC,"There is an entire hacking section dedicated to car chases   Yeah, but it doesn't work at all. There are always too many prompts on the screen when you're trying to raise the blockades, and the enemies just run into them and drive away like nothing happened.   I've never had an issue with insta-fail   There are sections of the game that are completely unintuitive and impossible to learn organically and on the fly. Failing to meet some obscure requirement like staying within 10 meters of some arbitrary point will cause you to immediately fail. Enemies seeing you at all, even though you could easily kill them, will sometimes cause missions to fail.  It's not a game you get good at. You're required to follow rules that are completely unclear and change from mission to mission. It's just bad design.   Tbh sounds like you don't know what you're talking about.   To be honest, it sounds like you've never played the game since you've never encountered these problems. It's a boring, frustrating piece of garbage."
consoledeals,391179,NastyNinja,2,Mon Jun 8 18:25:17 2015 UTC,"Again, I really dont think you have played enough to know what you are talking about. I'm well over half way through and thought the game nothing but enjoyable. (including collectibles, side missions etc.)  There arent too many prompts at all, the game even has an indicator telling you when the best time to activate a hack is, and it works 100% of the time and it always selects the proper device to hack (blockers, traffic lights, spike strips, pipe burst etc.) as long as you do it at the right time.  @3:07 you can see what i'm referring to, the guy does it way too early, and thats why it doesnt work. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y6P54d6nKM  If you follow objectives you shouldnt fail, just like any other game. I have absolutely zero idea what you're talking about, i've never auto failed a mission like you described.   there are no rules to this game, as you say. You can run in guns blazing, or you can hack your way through the entire game. Pretty sure thats about as open as a game like this can get."

consoledeals,38wuag,quasimotohumpback,4,Sun Jun 7 22:49:02 2015 UTC,I almost didn't get this price matched at Best Buy.  Best Buy has the version that says 'Bonus Content' and it comes with a card board sleeve. The Target ad has the regular box art and the cashiers argument was that they are different versions and therefore can't price match it.  I asked to speak with the supervisor then she proceeded to price match it.  Probably didn't want to put up with my shit.
consoledeals,38wuag,andyandthetuna,3,Sun Jun 7 23:33:14 2015 UTC,"My $41 Target copy had the same sleeve with the ""bonus content"" list. Sorry you had to go through the hassle of going to the super"

consoledeals,38wuag,quasimotohumpback,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:17:01 2015 UTC,Well that sucks. My argument was going to be that this game just released and the 'Bonus Content' versions are just like the regular ones. That it's just free content that was put there as an incentive for people to buy them near release. Both versions are equally priced!

consoledeals,388q4z,Girvil,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:32:57 2015 UTC,"This game looks like a much more hardcore version of left for dead, am I correct with that assumption? I've watched some twitch feeds and it looks really fun."
consoledeals,388q4z,Girvil,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:04:00 2015 UTC,It's not really horde mode like L4D. It's more like open world zombie RPG.
consoledeals,388q4z,Girvil,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:16:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly thats even better. out of the 12 games I have for XBone 8 of them are open world, lol."

consoledeals,387ivd,DealsPoster,2,Tue Jun 2 12:20:33 2015 UTC,Any word on how good these headphones are?
consoledeals,387ivd,RighteousMan,2,Tue Jun 2 13:15:46 2015 UTC,The other times this has been on sale people said the sound was good but the build was bad.  The headset would squeeze their head tight and hurt their ears.

consoledeals,387ivd,Lucosis,2,Tue Jun 2 20:24:35 2015 UTC,"I sent them back,  after reading through reviews. Supposedly it snaps from the middle because of the material they used. And also it was really tight."

consoledeals,387ivd,last_astronaut,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:55:58 2015 UTC,i used it every night for bout a week or two
consoledeals,387ivd,dragonisinogard,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:04:56 2015 UTC,"You should write to amazon, they might send you a new one or maybe a refund. If your looking for a new headset,  I would recommend Sennheiser headsets. Its more expensive but worth the quality."
consoledeals,387ivd,last_astronaut,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:41:09 2015 UTC,"I got them from Gamestop, and don't believe I have a receipt anymore. I am saving up for a pair of Turtle Beach Elite 800"
consoledeals,387ivd,dragonisinogard,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:00:34 2015 UTC,They are ok. They are comfortable for about 20 minutes then the pressure starts to hurt a bit after. I would not recommend these if you are using these for sessions that are over 30 minutes unless you can handle slight pain for long periods of time.
consoledeals,387ivd,obeseLadyGaga,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:03:38 2015 UTC,"Having had these for almost 6 months since I got them free with my PS4, I can definitely say that for that low price, they're worth the buy. The sound quality is good, the mic itself is great and I haven't heard any complaints from people I communicate with online. They also work as pretty good headphones that can plug into anything with an earphone jack or USB port.  However, there are some cons to this headset. The first would be that it's wired so if you don't like wired headsets, then this headset isn't for you. Also the headset tends to squeeze one's head too much causing discomfort after 30 minutes of use. This will gradually stop with more use. (Stopped hurting after two weeks of use)   Although, there's an easy fix to this. If you can find a thick enough object or several books to put the headset around, you can place the headset around them overnight and it should stretch it enough so that it doesn't hurt anymore.   Overall, this headset is definitely worth it and for that price now (Used to be $60 and then $40) it's definitely a steal. In addition, it almost acts as a demo for the Sony Gold Headset and because of this headset, I'm planning to buy the Gold Headset pretty soon."

consoledeals,3870xo,Maverick916,2,Wed Jun 3 02:45:56 2015 UTC,I'm waiting for more reviews myself before I decide to pick this up or not. A few people I follow on Youtube got one and are in the process of reviewing it. https://youtu.be/ZvMnVqdHjVo
consoledeals,3856jr,DealsPoster,2,Mon Jun 1 22:55:29 2015 UTC,"Be very wary with these. Hardware coolers are notorious for destroying systems, both consoles and laptops of the like. If it blows air in through the exhaust, do not buy. Also, I don't know if the PS4 is able to be set vertically. Would appreciate if someone pointed out whether or not it could, but I would leave it horizontal for fear of it getting knocked over. Not to mention with it getting hot, you don't have to worry about heat and gravity taking its toll on the hardware and flexing it out of the soldering much like with hardware in general if you leave it flat as opposed to vertical.  Looks like a good buy nonetheless. I'd buy it for the charging ports alone."

But I heard the game has a LOT of paid DLC and from what i've heard its not very fun without paying extra for the DLC.   kinda sounds like Destiny to me, which was ruined by the DLC because they basically force you to buy it otherwise people have much better stuff than you just because they paid.   I may pick it up, but only to add to my collection, not because its a great game."

Id say that the game is 75% playable in Matchmaking. Only a couple of the playlists have ranks still 6 months later. Campaigns seem to work fine.
consoledeals,36x9m7,GaussBoss,7,Sat May 23 07:07:17 2015 UTC,"$350 for a ""next-gen"" console, especially with a spiffy non-standard paint job, is pretty okay right now.  Most things worth playing are going to be multiplats and if you're invested in the Xbox ecosystem in some way(friends play it, there's one must-have exclusive, or you REALLY care about that Gamerscore stuff), then you have a reason to get the One.  If anybody is on the fence though, there are rumors of a price drop for the PS4 at E3 and, seeing as it's just a month away, it might be worth seeing what the big two announce at the show before pulling the trigger on one of these systems right now."

Great mic and the game audio sounds good. Only cons would be it takes up a USB slot (not too big of a deal) and if used for quite a while it may hurt your ears a tad bit. But for the price, you can't really complain. I can do a mic test if you want."

consoledeals,36kpl8,HeadCrusher3000,1 point,Wed May 20 16:52:14 2015 UTC,Buy the ps3 games on ps now I can play? Along with vita titles? Even though I don't have a vita or ps3? I bought one last time hasn't came in yet and I'm still confused as to what is does
consoledeals,36kpl8,SirTyronne,2,Wed May 20 17:30:18 2015 UTC,"Correct, best way to think of it is just a modem to the Playstation world. It will connect with PS Now (so you can play PS3 and PS Vita titles you rent/buy there) as well as remote play for PS4 (I don't believe it supports PS3 remote play... yet?). You don't need to own a Vita or PS3 to buy games from the Playstation Store and play them through your Playstation TV."
consoledeals,36kpl8,stryder_J,1 point,Wed May 20 17:46:03 2015 UTC,"To add to your statement - It does play Vita titles natively, both through the store and a Vita cartridge slot so you can get Vita games from brick and mortar stores as well as online at PlayStation's store.  Vita titles that require touch are an issue."
consoledeals,36kpl8,Logical_Phallusy,3,Wed May 20 18:34:50 2015 UTC,"Will it allow me to keep my PS4 at home and play it from, say a hotel room for when I travel for work?  I have one of those Gaems Vanguard portable gaming environment, but they are a bit tiresome to lug around."
consoledeals,36kpl8,stryder_J,1 point,Thu May 21 00:15:32 2015 UTC,I would assume that the lag/latency would be awful in a hotel room far from your house.

It also requires you to use Sony's SD cards which are $20 for 16GB and up... Cancelled the order.  Save yourself the $40 and get a chromecast, fire stick, or roku or something instead.

If it had Netflix and YouTube, and didn't have those latency problems - I'd consider it. But after $40 + an SD card, it's not worth my money."
consoledeals,35vzjd,ajpearman9,3,Thu May 14 00:57:00 2015 UTC,"Not sure why your original post got down voted. I found it very informative. Prior to reading your post if planed to rush out on lunch & snag one of these. Now I'm doing research & genuinely want to thank you for taking the time to post what you did. It's made me stop & think about my potential impulse buy which typically don't work out in my favor. With what you've said, this would have been another in a long chain of disappointments. I was buying it for Netflix & remote play in the upstairs bedroom. Thanks again for your post. I up voted you though it's still in the negative."
consoledeals,35vzjd,Mallion1,1 point,Thu May 14 12:03:08 2015 UTC,It works really good on my wired network.  I haven't needed a memory card for anything yet.  I haven't played a vita game for it but did down load a PS one game.    To me its worth not moving around my ps4.
consoledeals,35vzjd,fudnip,1 point,Thu May 14 01:32:13 2015 UTC,"Have you remotely played a PS4 game with it? If so, how was that experience? I have a vita & remote play it's lag-tastic on some games. I would be connecting this to my network via lan for use in the upstairs bedroom. I know it doesn't have Netflix natively but can you remote play that from the PS4?"
consoledeals,35vzjd,Mallion1,1 point,Thu May 14 11:58:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried to do streaming through it as I use my chromecast to do that ( I like using my tablet as a remote way better than a controller).   My pstv and ps 4 are both on a gigabit network and I'm able to play with no noticeable lag.   I'm sure if you played competitive fighting games or death match fps you might be more critical but it played dragon age, shadow of mordor, Lego batman, wolfenstein, far cry, and borderlands on it  with out issue.   When on WiFi it was laggyand disconnected lots unless you line of sighted the pstv and the ps4.  My bedroom TV is a 32inch 720p so there is no issues there. With it not outputting 1080p."
consoledeals,35vzjd,fudnip,3,Thu May 14 12:49:29 2015 UTC,"Explain to me how chromecast, fire stick, or a roku will allow me to play my PS Vita games on my TV.  Explain to me how buying a spare HDMI and power cable is going to make it more convenient for me to play my PS4 in my living room when it's located in my room on the third floor."
consoledeals,35vzjd,Zeldoon,-1,Thu May 14 00:27:11 2015 UTC,"If playing PSVita games on the TV is worth $40 to you then I guess it's worth it. But the Vita library is already really slim, I don't own any Vita games, and the PS4 streaming component of the PSTV requires a wired connection to be anywhere close to acceptable. And even wired, it is inconsistent and laggy.  Coupled with the absurd cost of sony's SD cards, and the lack of Netflix and YouTube - it's not worth it to me. If you love PSVita and have a good library, it might be worth it. It also might be worth it if you have a great ISP and want to play PS Now games. I have neither of those things, so to me the PSTV would only serve to let me play my PS4 from a different room."
consoledeals,35vzjd,ajpearman9,3,Thu May 14 01:00:28 2015 UTC,"I don't really know why you're getting downvoted for your opinion here. You're not stating anything wrong.  To me, a PSTV to play Vita games is worth it and I even picked one up when they were $80. I absolutely loved Muramasa on the Wii and I am trilled I got to play it, in better resolution and with additional content, on PSTV.  My PS3 burnt out on me and there were a few games I wanted to play, but didn't want to buy another PS3 considering I now have a PS4 and have exhausted most of the PS3 library. Games like Dragon's Crown and Final Fantasy X/X-2 (this was before the announced PS4 edition) were on Vita and PS3 along with Vita only games like Freedom Wars made it worth it.  I already had a Vita, so buying a memory card wasn't an issue. I just don't find the Vita particularly comfortable (even with the added grips and triggers) and the PSTV scratched that itch for several games."

consoledeals,35tmdj,DealsPoster,10,Wed May 13 12:17:50 2015 UTC,"Boxeddeal is legit. Got an email code for TLOU remastered within a minute. This is a good deal since the expansion pass is 35, meaning you can get all caught up for 60 in time for the new expansion release next week.   Be warned though, a lot of the criticism is deserved. It is very fun to play, but it is modeled like an MMO with relatively limited content, and that is certainly not everyone's cup of tea."

consoledeals,35thi7,Spure,2,Thu May 14 01:30:39 2015 UTC,"Purchasable content ruined this franchise for me. I used to pick up every Dead or Alive game on launch. I downloaded the demo for this one from the PS Store & that's when I saw just how much DLC was available for this game. None of that should exist, plain & simple. It was all available for purchase on day one & should have been included in the game as unlockable items through play. Who the fuck wants to buy clothing for a digital character in a fighting game? The unlockable items were what made these titles have significant replay value & some genius decided to monetize it instead. Nice work! On a plus note, when this game inevitably reaches the $10 bargin bin you should be able to pick it up & all the dlc for about what the game should have cost in total at launch. Again, nice work.."

It's like unlocking the end cinematic for each character. If they decided to suddenly start selling those cinematic endings rather than having them as things you earned through play they would essentially be trying to monetize a part of a game you supposedly already paid for with the games purchase. You may not give a shit if companies destroy their own intellectual properties but I sure as hell do. If they're going to change fundamental aspects a game in a dash to make themselves a quick buck or two they need to expect poor sales. It was an asshole move, plain & simple."

I'm sure I'll have tons of vita fanboys telling me they ""never had any problems with it,"" but this game is objectively garbage. It runs poorly in every way possible and just isn't worth the money. I couldn't complete the dlc because the game glitched out and I couldn't physically access the ramp to the dlc. Unbelievable. It was kind of neat having it on the go and I actually preferred the more cel-shaded look of the graphics (even though the water looks terrible), but the game is just fundamentally broken and isn't worth your money.

I say shady because it was a product page listed briefly on a Swedish site before it was taken down.  If I didn't already have these, I would buy at $9.99 without question. It's showing OOS, but you can just click to the vendor list and choose to buy from Amazon, and they'll send it when it's back in stock."
consoledeals,34wn88,undersaur,4,Tue May 5 05:29:46 2015 UTC,Uncharted 4 also got delayed to 2016 so maybe at e3 we will get a collection annocument . Also it's running on a older version of the last of us engine and that was ported over to ps4. Still if you are on ps3 then this is definitely worth 10$
consoledeals,34wn88,bookerdewittt,3,Tue May 5 12:49:09 2015 UTC,They are only rumors.  The artwork that gets tossed around is 100% fake and was made by a guy as a concept art.  There's no real proof or even hints at remasters.... not saying it's never going to happen just saying that you might as well just get the PS3 versions.

Although I did think I got ripped off for a second there.. So after making the purchase, you'll get an email and you have to click ""download"" near the bottom of the email receipt. Then, it opens up in a new browser and asks that you provide your phone number, not sure about you but that was (and still is) a red flag for me and I just hope I don't start getting telemarketing calls :-/  Anyway, not sure if they have to do it for legal reasons or something, but I figured i can always just block the callers if they come. So then after providing your number, they'll send you a 4 digit code via text or call (whichever you prefer), which you then enter to ""verify"".. After clicking verify, the page refreshed and then nothing came up!! I was starting to get a little mad by this point because I thought ""welp, this was surely a scam then, and you fell for it"" so I waited a few seconds and still nothing.. figured i should refresh the page.. then, viola! code appeared. There's a link they provide to the xbox website where you can then redeem the code. Redeemed it right away and bam, got myself 12 months of live at a deal. Definitely recommend buying for the price... Even if it means blocking a few telemarketers, haha"
consoledeals,34tjh0,MentalMenusha,2,Tue May 5 08:58:20 2015 UTC,The only issue I had is I can not redeem the code since I have a current active membership that ends on 06/15/15. Microsoft has a policy that does not allow stacking of memberships anymore but as soon as it expires I can redeem it and total price was $34.19 after 5% off so great deal.
consoledeals,34tjh0,WtFxMintBerry,2,Tue May 5 13:03:50 2015 UTC,It stated on xbox.com that the policy is indeed prohibiting the ability to stack memberships but I tried adding the 25 digit code that I got anyway and i'm good now till 5/18/16.  Strange but not complaining!

And through paypal shipping its only about $2 to ship. Actually I wasn't aware you could sell them to Amazon for gift cards.  Out of curiosity as an example I just did a comparison of net profit from selling/trading in Shadow of Mordor for PS4 between Amazon and ebay.   ebay: ~$17 CASH after their commission and shipping. Pro's: more $ and cash versus a gift card, cons: more risk - sometimes buyers try to screw you over by submitting tickets that they didn't authorize the purchase or you never shipped it. I've only had this happen once in years though amazon: ~$10 gift card after shipping (I assume you have to pay this). Pro's: safer than ebay, con's: only 60% of the profit and you're locked into buying thru amazon via gift card"
consoledeals,32uolz,FoxK56,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:45:47 2015 UTC,How much would you sell shadow of mordor for you to keep 17? And no amazon provides the shipping labels all you need is to drop it off
consoledeals,32uolz,Houseofcards00,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:09:32 2015 UTC,"I was calculating $22 with free shipping.

Ah cool about the Amazon shipping, that brings the profits a bit closer to each other"
consoledeals,32uolz,FoxK56,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:17:40 2015 UTC,"I see well yeah eBay is cash which is better , so once you sell it paypal offers you a shipping label for $2?"

Occasionally they offer ps4 games that have been opened and returned. The quality of the games is typically really good, no scratches or broken cases (typically. It can and does happen sometimes). I just got Watch Dogs for $12 from them. Check regularly though as they only offer one copy of the game when it does pop up."

consoledeals,32l3tu,AnotherUselessPwn,4,Tue Apr 14 17:42:29 2015 UTC,This does not work.  Target applies the cartwheel coupon first (even stated on their site) and then if the price match is still lower they just give you the lower cost.  If you are able to find someone at a local Target that does price match and then give you the coupon then good for you but that is not the norm.  I just tried this yesterday and ended up paying the price match cost.

consoledeals,31rg3f,IbanezHRC,-1,Wed Apr 8 03:07:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you. People these days never take their time with games. I have the collectors edition of it also. I only played the prologue and it was good to me. I'm always working though. Maybe that's why I enjoy games more. Also, they used to be a handheld console game developer. I say it's pretty good for a first time project on a bigger gaming console."

The sound quality was not the issue, the whole design shape is flawed.   It squeezes your head in constantly. I even had my brother try it and same problem.

consoledeals,31mnm6,IzeBerg,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:12:32 2015 UTC,"So to get the 7.1, you have to run a wire from the headset to the usb on the ps4? Or is that little extra plug on the controller a USB port?"
consoledeals,31mnm6,IzeBerg,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:25:36 2015 UTC,"If I understand it right, the USB must be connected to the console for 7.1 sound.  It can connect to the controller via 3.5mm, but it won't be 7.1 through the controller."
consoledeals,31mnm6,joshjcummings,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:36:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I was afraid that was the case (whats the point of that other connection on the controller tho?)
consoledeals,31mnm6,GeodesicGnome,2,Mon Apr 6 17:38:33 2015 UTC,"You can plug any set of headphones into the 3.5mm port in the controller.    However, using the USB-to-console with the Silver headset will take advantage of the 7.1 surround, as well as let you use the headset companion app that you can download to your PS3/4 for free.  The companion app has preset sound levels for some of the bigger games.  You can preload these preset levels into the headset.  I use the Gold wireless headset and I really like the presets for Bloodborne."
consoledeals,31mnm6,pr0adam,2,Mon Apr 6 17:41:26 2015 UTC,"I mean the ""ext"" plug, but it seems it's only good for charging docks. I am still kicking myself for not going on Black Friday to get the Gold Wireless headset for 40 bucks."

I've been really wanting one and have been waiting on a deal but the only thing is I don't have much interest in Nintendo Land. Should I hold out for a better deal or is this one probably going to be the best bet for a while?
consoledeals,31dxgw,Nikedawg,3,Sat Apr 4 14:55:00 2015 UTC,Yep. I think this is typically 300 bucks.
consoledeals,31dxgw,chipper747,2,Sat Apr 4 16:05:30 2015 UTC,"It's either this or the refurb for $200 that RightDeadFred mentioned. If Super Mario 3D World is something you're going to want, go with this (although the game is a digital copy, no disk). If you don't care about that game as much, or would want to buy it used, the refurb deal is cheaper.  You probably won't find a better deal than either of these. This deal for $260 comes around every couple months, but for me it was never when I wanted it. hah."

Just depends how much you want to save a little money."
consoledeals,31dxgw,RightDeadFred,-1,Mon Apr 6 18:23:49 2015 UTC,"Yes this is a really good deal and I'm hoping it ends soon because its driving the price of used Wii Us down while I'm trying to sell my console haha.  If you are in the market for a Wii U, that is a great price. The only cheaper option I know of is Nintendo's refurb program which is really cheap because they're just trying to get rid of those products."

Whether you choose next-day or two-day shipping, Dell will automatically change it to standard shipping (3 - 8 day).  You can take it up with Customer Service, but since outsourced Indian call centers don't have an incentive to actually resolve issues (they are scrutinized on how many calls they take, not how many issues they fix), you probably won't get anything out of a dispute with the company. - okinawanmatt"

In a year that saw the release of Grand Theft Auto V, The Last of Us, Bioshock Infinite, Super Mario 3D World, Fire Emblem: Awakening, Rayman Legends, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, and DOTA 2, that a game with a Metascore of 79 could actually have the balls to claim to be ""Game of the Year"" would be funny if it wasn't so sad.  I suppose it could have been the Xbox One Game of the Year for 2013, but that's really more of a sad commentary on how lackluster the Xbox One launch lineup was than on how good Forza 5 was.  Sorry, not trying to trash this deal or even Forza 5, just how sad and desperate so many of these ""Game of the Year"" claims are."

consoledeals,30xi82,DCTiger5,2,Tue Mar 31 16:58:48 2015 UTC,Still 14.  But its been adequate for me.
consoledeals,30xi82,DatClubbaLang96,2,Tue Mar 31 18:41:40 2015 UTC,"Last Fifa game I really got into was '10. I've been wanting to get '15, but I haven't seen the right price yet. Anyone know of better deals for it around?  Also, at this point, should I just wait for Fifa 16?"
consoledeals,30xi82,wastingxp,2,Tue Mar 31 14:51:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like $30 is a fair price at this time. FIFA 15 would be a good restart for you then. A little bit of gameplay improvement and enhanced graphics. The focus clearly shifted to UT but career mode is still decent.  Unless you're going to shell out $59.99 on release date for FIFA 16, I would grab this now."
consoledeals,30xi82,Awake00,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:32:01 2015 UTC,"I've really enjoyed FIFA 15. It's fresh and challenging. Personally, I haven't liked any FIFA since 12, but 15 feels like a proper restart."
consoledeals,30xi82,Awake00,0,Tue Mar 31 15:01:49 2015 UTC,"Fifa games come out in may June. The online shit is extremely competitive, so if you're just wanting to play against the cpu or friends and don't care about updated rosters then sure.   I always sell off my fifa a month before the next year comes out. You might be able to find even better deals on Craigslist."

consoledeals,30w14r,joeismoe,3,Tue Mar 31 03:58:34 2015 UTC,Is this website legit?
consoledeals,30w14r,Dethwi5h,3,Tue Mar 31 04:54:24 2015 UTC,It's a key reseller.  There's no way of knowing how they got the cd key but it for sure was not given to them by the publisher.  It seems a little sketchy.  I bit and bought it.  The  key came right away after a verification.  But what I received was a link with a picture of a scan of the cd key.  Worst comes to worst I'm out 2.25 if the key was stolen and gets reported.  There was the incident a while back with Ubisoft revoking a bunch of copies of Farcry 4 from people that bought through unauthorized third party sellers(G2A and the like).  AFAIK your account won't get banned but you will lose the game more than likely if it was a stolen key.  Always be cautious when you purchase a digital key for a game through a third party reseller.  If you're ever unsure publishers usually have a list of some sort with the official resellers.
consoledeals,30w14r,V4nd4L22,2,Tue Mar 31 05:14:31 2015 UTC,"Like the other guy said, the keys from these sites are keys that came with the console bundles then resold. Site itself is similar with G2A with the differences being; smaller catalogue, direct seller (G2A is more of a marketplace for other sellers to sell their stuff), no hidden fees (G2A transaction fee is rather high + have to pay extra if you want insurance), faster processing (since they sell the codes directly, they email it immediately after payment)   I've used them many times, no issue yet."

consoledeals,30tfiq,thorlord,2,Mon Mar 30 17:41:57 2015 UTC,It seems like a very good price. Cowboom doesn't typically come with controllers.
consoledeals,30tfiq,GUI_VB_IP_Tracker,2,Mon Mar 30 18:26:40 2015 UTC,"Keep searching the lists for ones with controllers. I got my PS4, controller included, on the 4th or 5th page of listings."
consoledeals,30tfiq,thorlord,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:32:42 2015 UTC,I read the listing carefully as I saw it listed what it did and didn't have.   The one I ordered says the only things missing are the HDMI cable and the manual.  Ill probably still order a controller anyway. Having at least two controllers is handy.   Mostly Ive been wanting this to get the new dance central. I lost 100lbs playing DC3 and need to get back into shape again.
consoledeals,30tfiq,Zombiii,1 point,Mon Mar 30 23:46:14 2015 UTC,Cdkeys has it for $2.25 right now. Never ordered from them but other people have voucher for its legitimacy.   http://www.cdkeys.com/xbox-live/games/dance-central-spotlight-xbox-one
consoledeals,30q26d,wiidiculous,4,Sun Mar 29 18:50:26 2015 UTC,The early bird gets the worm but the second mouse gets the cheese. I've wanted this game for a while but the bugs and glitches turned me off. Target had a $20 deal last week but I couldn't do a Price Match plus GCU at Best Buy.  Assuming that Best Buy would do a deal in the near future: http://i.imgur.com/H6HAs1M.png  Thank you reward certificates. :D

consoledeals,30q26d,FalloutLoneWanderer,2,Mon Mar 30 03:01:27 2015 UTC,"I borrowed it from a friend release week and compared from then to now in the first few missions there definitely is an improvement but I did have one moment of framerate drops for a few seconds, but before it was every two or three minutes or so."
consoledeals,30q26d,ajpearman9,2,Mon Mar 30 15:45:00 2015 UTC,The frame rate seems to be smooth to me. It had noticeably dipped only one time during a cut scene. The dip occurred when I was replaying a mission and constantly trying to skip the cinematics. Other than that the frames seem constant.

consoledeals,30q26d,wastingxp,5,Mon Mar 30 04:06:44 2015 UTC,Walmart's trade-in value for this game is still $17 so you could easily play it and then trade it in for pretty much nothing.
consoledeals,30q26d,FalloutLoneWanderer,2,Sun Mar 29 19:58:19 2015 UTC,I'm thinking of getting this or Watch_Dogs. I have a $5 coupon and GCU...   Which one do you think is better?

consoledeals,30keou,ScubaEli,2,Sat Mar 28 18:51:39 2015 UTC,I also got the $35 difference refunded but they said they can't give me the $20 gift card.
consoledeals,30keou,redafa,2,Sat Mar 28 22:24:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't even notice the $20 dollar gift card, so I imagine I didn't get it either. Still better than no gift card and costing an extra $35, so I'm not too disappointed."

consoledeals,30keou,Benemy,4,Sun Mar 29 16:00:11 2015 UTC,"Bought. That's effectively $80 worth of discounts, if you were going to pick up Bloodborne at launch (and realistically, it's the first killer app for the system, so most people were)."
consoledeals,30keou,DrunkWiseman,3,Sat Mar 28 14:16:59 2015 UTC,Think this may be the bundle I have been waiting for. Any upcoming deals I should wait for?
consoledeals,30keou,RonMecca,3,Sun Mar 29 04:02:45 2015 UTC,"As a person whose been diligently waiting for a good PS4 deal, I jumped on this as soon as I saw it. I would say go for it, I doubt you will have any regrets, maybe $10-20s worth of regrets at most, but now you don't have to worry about it anymore and just enjoy the console."
consoledeals,30keou,DrunkWiseman,2,Sun Mar 29 17:21:07 2015 UTC,"I recommend you spend the $20 to get the Diablo 3 Ultimate Edition. For $10 more, you have a LOT of game. (or buy Hellraisers.)"

consoledeals,30hf9t,danny0wnz,3,Fri Mar 27 12:15:20 2015 UTC,"As with everything on Cowboom... ""heavy scuffs and scratches"".   Does they buff each console they receive with sandpaper?"
consoledeals,30hf9t,JARL_OF_DETROIT,9,Fri Mar 27 14:30:49 2015 UTC,"My hunch is they make it sound a lot worse than it is so people don't complain.  If they said ""light scratches"", somebody could easily get upset because they feel the scratches are worse than ""light"".  Realistically speaking, how scratched up can a console get?  It may get the occasional scratch or two by carelessly throwing a controller on it or something, but it's not like consoles often get moved once they are setup."
consoledeals,30hf9t,junkit33,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:56:18 2015 UTC,That's possible. A lot though come with pictures and you can tell how scratched they are.
consoledeals,30hf9t,JARL_OF_DETROIT,8,Fri Mar 27 16:14:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but while my ps4 I orderd was listed the same, it came virtually flawless."

consoledeals,30hf9t,Lucosis,2,Fri Mar 27 15:41:33 2015 UTC,"Adding to the confirmation. Bought a grade 4 Xbone last year, it had 2 scratches that are only visible when tilting the console while under sunlight. It looks flawless otherwise."
consoledeals,30hf9t,serfis,2,Sat Mar 28 03:26:41 2015 UTC,"I can second OP, I ordered my PS4 through there and it said the same thing, but when it came in I was (pleasantly) surprised to see that it was in great shape."
consoledeals,30hf9t,flyufools,0,Fri Mar 27 15:45:51 2015 UTC,"I ordered one a month or two ago. Mine had a similar description, and it was pretty true to its word. The scratches covered most of the gloss and even some of the front portion of the console.   I was lucky enough to get one with all the accessories and cables and it even came with a Titan Fall controller. I've been using it consistently since then and have had no issues whatsoever. I consider it a pretty great deal. My suggestion is to take the chance if you're on the fence."
consoledeals,30hf9t,JARL_OF_DETROIT,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:08:13 2015 UTC,"Yea, I don't get the listings at all. They all say significant scuffs and scratches as well as no controller. Some people say they got a controller anyway, so I'm not sure how that works. Every single one is listed with all cables and cords but no controller..."
consoledeals,30hf9t,flyufools,0,Fri Apr 3 15:30:38 2015 UTC,It's pretty rare that you get a listing that has a controller included. My listing did have a controller listed. Just keep an eye out for a listing with controller. You'll get lucky eventually.
consoledeals,30hf9t,SMB73,2,Fri Apr 3 15:35:46 2015 UTC,"Do they offer extended warranties on these consoles? Cowboom is part of Best Buy, aren't they?"

consoledeals,30hf9t,mattinm,4,Fri Mar 27 13:45:06 2015 UTC,I got my PS4 through them for around $270 back in November. I know they've had at least one similar sale since then.

I actually played through the first two both alone and then again with my wife (who has never really played games besides this) and we had a lot of fun! Salem and Rios were the perfect combo. Co-op players in the first two could switch weapons, do back-to-back mode at times, be strategic, high five (or play air guitar, or something) and do the dumb little things that made Army of Two what it is—a popcorn action-comedy flick in shoot-em-up game form. Perfect for what it was.   Devil's Cartel chopped out every single good part of the series that gave it that personality. They made generic heroes that were supposed to feel more ""personal"" and failed miserably. Then of course there's the —SPOILER ALERT — fact that they somehow decided making one of the heroes from the first game the BAD GUY! Total WTF moment. It was so obvious I guessed it as soon as you didn't see Salem die. And it went completely against character for a glaringly obvious shock factor. Salem was an asshole, but that certainly wasn't him. So stupid.   I still occasionally play through Army of Two 40th Day and love it. If I can get my wife to play, it's all the better."

If you have played some of those titles in the past, it's just more of the same in a city that's supposed to be Chicago but in fact doesn't really resemble the Windy City all that much."
consoledeals,309po0,materialking,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:45:18 2015 UTC,"Overall, it wasn't worth passing up half a copy of Hellraisers."
consoledeals,309po0,junyah54,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:29:14 2015 UTC,"I played I dunno...maybe 30 minutes of it.  To me, the main character was boring, the setting was grey and boring, and you just did a lot of the same shit. The hacking thing was a thing, but it was more of a gimmick then a mechanic (although making people smash into traffic ballasts will never ever get old).  Plus, it created this odd vigilantism where you became like an even more insane version of the Punisher. Some guy cheats on his wife - drain all the money of his bank accounts. Votes liberatarian? Drain all the money out of her account. Domestic violence? Shoot them in the head. Petty Theft? Run them over with a car.  It was like somebody wanted vigilantes and somebody else wanted GTA and they couldn't quite reconcile it."
consoledeals,309po0,materialking,2,Wed Mar 25 20:52:50 2015 UTC,Hold the extra game until you get one of those triple trade-in values from BB or Target and bazam!

consoledeals,309po0,DrunkWiseman,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:04:21 2015 UTC,"As a note - I had Best Buy price match this, and they groused a bit (mostly trying to make it somebody else's fault for giving me $120 retail worth of stuff for nothing), but didn't have any issues price matching it.  My roommate tried to convince them to add the free stereo headset (it's a BBY promo), but they didn't like that idea, and I didn't fight it."
consoledeals,309708,sgspace321,5,Wed Mar 25 14:29:52 2015 UTC,"if you regularly have people over, this game is PERFECT for couch co-op. It's also fun solo and online, but in a world where couch-co-op is quickly disappearing, I feel like that's worth mentioning."

consoledeals,309708,dark_delight,3,Wed Mar 25 18:38:27 2015 UTC,Very faithful port to the PC version with some tweaks added in.  Beware of online play though. Full of dickhead cheaters and hacked gear.

consoledeals,2zjytu,badgerprime,6,Thu Mar 19 21:25:54 2015 UTC,"Also note, you can turn in two PS3s if they have different sized hard drives. I did this yesterday with two PS3s and a 360.  Edit: Actually, here's how I took full advantage of this: First, I traded in Destiny on ps3 for $17, and used it to reactivate my powerup rewards membership. They now give you monthly coupons as a powerup member, and this week only, on my receipt they printed a coupon for a free year of ps+ with the purchase of a new ps4.  Then I traded in a 250GB 360, a 250GB PS3, and a 320GB PS3, all for $175 each. The PS3s both had a lot of dust so I had to eat ~$35 refurbish fees on both. Still, enough to get the $400 Last of Us PS4 bundle, and then use the year of ps+ coupon as well.  Then I traded in all my ps3 games and accessories. With that trade in credit and what was left from the consoles, I bought a $100 used 360, and used another powerup coupon that was printed on the receipt for a free 20GB used 360 hard drive with the purchase of a used 360.  So basically traded two PS3s for a PS4, and still had a 360 for my wife to continue playing Minecraft on."
consoledeals,2zjytu,Indoorsman,5,Thu Mar 19 13:55:14 2015 UTC,70 bucks for dust?  Wtf.

consoledeals,2zjytu,Indoorsman,4,Thu Mar 19 15:15:11 2015 UTC,"Former Gamestop employee here: a complete trade includes a/v cable, power cable, system, and 1 controller. If you trade in to a store, they will test the console on a tv in the back. If you trade in by mail, they will require a credit card and will charge the difference if they find the console defective. It's in the terms and conditions you agree to before the trade.  Edit: /u/Indoorsman is right, forgot to clarify controller has to have its charge cable. Doesn't have to be the OEM one it came with though, same for the video cable."
consoledeals,2zjytu,X_SADBOY_X,2,Thu Mar 19 18:17:50 2015 UTC,Also if you trade in a PS3 you have to have the controller charging cable I was told.
consoledeals,2zjytu,thesingingnerd,0,Thu Mar 19 21:46:11 2015 UTC,Do they have to be a/v cables with a ps3 or can it be an hdmi cable?

consoledeals,2zjytu,Sport6,3,Thu Mar 19 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"Former GameStop employee here, Let me tell you some tips and tricks you can use.  For trading in towards an Xbox One, buy a PS4. Then return the PS4, as they will give you full value for the console, and then buy an Xbox One.  Want to sell your games too? They almost always have deals where if you trade in towards a specific pre-order, you'll get anywhere from 10% - 40% more. Ask them. They have a book thing.  Make sure you sign up for, at the very least, a basic membership so that you can accrue points for a large purchase like a PS4."

consoledeals,2zjytu,theabolitionist,-1,Fri Mar 20 00:48:01 2015 UTC,0.75 for a game trade in? that is a horrible exaggeration.

consoledeals,2zjytu,thesingingnerd,-3,Fri Mar 20 05:31:10 2015 UTC,Gamestop sells that game for $4.99..... it's not like you're getting really shorted on the value.  But to pretend it's the norm to get $.75 for any game trade in is an exaggeration.  Games that they sell for 20-40 (most of their stock) would net you much more in trade value.

I'm done with the system (had it for like 5-6 years and played every game I want to on it) so I'm ready to get rid of it. I could try selling on craigslist, have them pull out the ""Gamestop only charges ____"" so that's all I can sell it for, or I can eat the $25 I know I'll lose anyway and trade in for the system I want (a PS4!). Hope that explains at least one man's reasoning."
consoledeals,2zjytu,junyah54,4,Thu Mar 19 18:22:13 2015 UTC,"Really, you don't think you will ever want to play a PS3 game again? And to sell a game you paid $40+ for for a $0.75 just does not make any sense to me."

consoledeals,2zjytu,redeuxx,1 point,Sat Mar 21 14:47:02 2015 UTC,It's not worth it especially when we see in a 10 years that the systems and games we sold for pennies on the dollar are going for 10 times that. I don't think the games from this pic are a good example of what will be sought after in a few years but I know that people will regret sales like these none the less. I've lived through 5 generations of console gaming and EVERYTIME I see people regret it.   It just sucks that people get ripped off by GameStop/best buy and the like. It also chaps my ass to see these retro shops & ebay sellers inflating prices of games just to make a buck. I hope that changes soon.

I don't really care for any of the 360 exclusives, most of which I can get on my PC anyway.  As for the games, if I've played them enough times to feel I'm done with them, then I figure I got my money's worth and it can just be some bonus cash on my trade."

Buying from CowBoom normally (not DOTD) will give you a list of consoles to choose from and their respective conditions; sometimes there are consoles in very good condition and they're all the same price.  This deal looks like it only includes the console and power cable. It likely does not include the controller, headset, HDMI or USB cables.  This may be a great deal for someone with multiple controllers already who is looking for a 2nd console, or if you are able to pick up a controller for cheap at your local gaming store or from a friend."

I think the biggest variations come in the condition of the outer case with some having close to perfect surfaces and others having scratches/scuffs.

I have two PS3s and a 360 I was considering trading in, and they did a dummy transaction to see if the system would accept it, and they all rang up for $175. They even called their store manager to verify and it's all on the up and up. Only thing is that if you have two of the same console, it'll only work if they have different size hard drives."

I politely mentioned that I called ahead to confirm and that it was the only I came into the store.  He didn't seem happy but he said he had to do it because an employee told me.  Seems like he easily put the $175 towards the MCC Xbox ONE bundle I bought with free 3 month xbox live.  He didn't need to do any cash register loops holes.  Made me think they just really want to sell more PS4's.  This was an awesome deal because I bought my Xbox 360 250 gb Slim for $130 off of Craigslist."

Groupon is so dumb...someone showed me a great deal they were selling the assassins creed bundle for $350.  Saving $50.  Uh no that's not a deal its the current price.

consoledeals,2ybpnd,meatmacho,2,Sun Mar 8 09:37:51 2015 UTC,I thought this was particularly intriguing when I believed it was a 12 month Live card.  Now it's just...better than nothing (maybe $40 added value).  So I'm still happy with the bundle I got a couple of weeks ago with Wolfenstein and an extra controller for the same price.  But it does seem that they're trying to throw all kinds of combo deals out there to entice anyone who's still on the fence about an Xbox One.
consoledeals,2ybpnd,Zombiii,1 point,Sun Mar 8 09:42:32 2015 UTC,Wish I got in on that deal. Wolfenstein and an extra controller for $349. Great deal. Does a deal like that come around often?
consoledeals,2ybpnd,Zombiii,2,Wed Mar 11 22:46:07 2015 UTC,"No, that was pretty much the best deal that I'd seen since November.  I was waiting for a deal, trying to justify buying an Xbox.   This one was just hard to pass up.  I had been trying for a while to get a cheap deal on an Xbox 360 on eBay, since Microsoft has a pretty generous trade in offer going.  All I needed was a bare console since I have everything else from my old one.  But that was a lot of work to save about $50 that never panned out.  Microsoft will also give you like 5% off in their store if you sign up for some text alerts or something.  There was a good deal on Groupon for like $303 OTD, but it included no games or anything, and I wasn't even sure they'd be considered an authorized seller for warranty purposes.    So all in all, yes the deal I got was great, especially since I already had $400 in Amazon credit.  But I expect to see them rotating in plenty of other similar deals to keep gaining market share from people like us who are waiting on the fence with cash.   Don't wait too long or you'll just waste time not playing, but see what the next deal might be after this NBA2k15 thing is done.  And don't forget you'll need to buy games (I've already picked up 3 more), a Live subscription, maybe other extras like a charge cable or fancy headset, extra controllers, etc.  I get pretty sheepish each time my wife walks in with a new package from the doorstep lately.  :)"

consoledeals,2y8abx,Wadderp,2,Sat Mar 7 10:16:45 2015 UTC,What's everyone think of this game? It looks pretty sweet to me

consoledeals,2y8cn3,cooldito,8,Sat Mar 7 18:20:10 2015 UTC,It almost certainly does not behave exactly like the official model.  See the calibration test in Dolphin for the mayflash model.  This isn't mayflash but I doubt it works 100% like the official.
consoledeals,2y8cn3,hypermog,4,Sat Mar 7 19:09:10 2015 UTC,It doesn't look to be THAT far off. Additionally a lot of the reviews seem to be positive. I think I'm gonna bite and see what happens.

consoledeals,2y8cn3,hypermog,4,Sun Mar 8 03:08:43 2015 UTC,I can confirm that it works perfectly. I bought one and was skeptical but it works just as well as a normal one
consoledeals,2y8dy1,DealsPoster,2,Sat Mar 7 11:28:07 2015 UTC,Can anyone comment if it is worth it at this price? Reviews are middle of the road. Just wondering if price would effect opinions any.
consoledeals,2y8dy1,WesWarlord,4,Sat Mar 7 18:28:06 2015 UTC,"That probably depends on why you're hesitating to begin with.  Yoshi's New Island isn't a bad game, per se, it's more of a ""why does it exist"" game.  When Yoshi's Island DS came along, the designers came up with some pretty significant changes to differentiate the game from its predecessor.  The problem is that none of those changes were well received, so this time around they stuck closer to the original format and introduced only minor changes.  But in doing so, they ended up with a game that feels almost entirely unnecessary, as fans seeking that style of gameplay can still get it from playing the far superior original game.  Add to that a lackluster plot rehash that actually manages to screw up the heartwarming plot of the first game, and you have a game that clearly only exists because someone decided it was time to make some money off of the franchise regardless of whether or not anyone had any good ideas for it.  Personally, I quickly gave up on trying to score 100 points in each level, settling for the bare minimum as I raced for the goal just so I could get a feel for the changes and experience the paper-thin plot so I could move on to a better game.  And the physical copy I bought cost me less than this, so getting it at a discount certainly didn't improve my outlook on the title.  I think the only reason to buy in at this price is that it seems like a really low price for a digital copy (though I don't follow Nintendo digital pricing trends too closely so I can't say for sure.)  And even if a physical copy would be okay by you, it appears that copies are rare enough to inflate the used price — Best Buy is charging $34.99 and GameStop is charging full MSRP.  The other reason to own this title is, perhaps, if you've never played a Yoshi's Island game before, and have nothing to directly compare it against.  But then again, if you haven't, the original SNES masterpiece is still a better game and something you would be better off playing by any means necessary."

consoledeals,2y6n2g,PyroSpark,2,Sat Mar 7 07:05:28 2015 UTC,"That is mostly true for the US. However, in Canada those Ebay deals become negated with the conversion and the shipping. I'm assuming the extra $25 they added to this is because SM3DW is included now."
consoledeals,2y6n2g,DirtyTurtle,1 point,Sat Mar 7 14:24:56 2015 UTC,That mario game makes a 60$ difference usually. But apparently they're selling them on the nintendo site for 33$. So either way you're getting a discount. Especially compared to the normal Mario World bundle which is 300$.

consoledeals,2xt4nb,Siggy778,1 point,Wed Mar 4 00:53:32 2015 UTC,"Like I said in another thread about Halo MCC:  The online experience right now is very shoddy.  People have workarounds (using party chat because in game voice doesn't work after 1 round), and many other problems of dropping players while searching, etc.    Matchmaking works great if you play by yourself.  I played hundreds of matches by myself with quick search times, but in my two months of playing, if I had a friend search with me, we either never found a game or it kicked one of us then threw us into a game.  Now for gameplay, that's a whole other level.  Here  is  my  experience  I linked those to a chat rep and I got the game refunded from a digital purchase.  In Halo 1 you fall through the map consistently, and the games end at random times (not at 50 kills or objective).  Halo 2 hit registration does not work at medium+ range, it'll show you hit them but they don't take damage.   I didn't play 3 or 4, but I did play the 2 Anniversary and that worked well."

consoledeals,2x8cd1,richardsquidly,1 point,Fri Feb 27 00:00:39 2015 UTC,"possibly, I don't own it, im on the fence for this one. I would think so, because you likely wont find it (much) cheaper for a good while, and it wont be broken forever...its ultimately your call."
consoledeals,2x8cd1,pizzaguy4378,3,Fri Feb 27 03:14:11 2015 UTC,It has been partially broken for long enough... 343 is not focusing on this as a priority.
consoledeals,2x8cd1,Roseysdaddy,1 point,Fri Feb 27 03:56:17 2015 UTC,"My brother and I play it mostly for campaign. Zero issues with that across all 4 games.

Take it however you like."

Technically, according to Sony's requirements for warranty service, ""auction sites"" (such as eBay), are not eligible for warranty servicing. Now, I'm sure there is wiggle room for Buy-It-Now items from legitimate sources (i.e. Newegg and Buy.com), but I personally wouldn't risk it."

consoledeals,2wydyr,Stay_Toasty,2,Wed Feb 25 08:01:39 2015 UTC,"I've been looking too. I read an article that said the lowest this exact deal has ever gotten was $259.99 so this isn't too bad to pull the trigger on. May not see anything lower for awhile, but we really don't know"
consoledeals,2wydyr,ExposDeezNuts,2,Wed Feb 25 15:21:23 2015 UTC,Lowest was $249 (Canada).  This was right after xmas mind you but if you're not desperate and can wait I'm sure that deal will pop up again.  This was at Shoppers Drug Mart but FutureShop price matched it.
consoledeals,2wydyr,HotShane,2,Wed Feb 25 20:53:02 2015 UTC,I've also been on the lookout for a deal. This is probably the best discount we're going to get for a while. I'm still holding out hope that the Nintendo store restocks their refurbished units.
consoledeals,2wydyr,armaghetto,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:37:33 2015 UTC,"This is pretty damn good, yeah. I was waiting for a while for a ~$250 system and it just didn't come. Jumped at the Walmart deal where I got the system for $300 and a $40 GC, which I put towards Smash Brothers.  If you wait a month or two, and are vigilant, you may see another similar $260 console on eBay or refurbbed from Nintendo, but if you want one, i'd just jump on this."
consoledeals,2wydyr,goldenmonkey1,1 point,Sat Feb 28 22:42:30 2015 UTC,"I picked it up online last night. If you're going to as well do yourself a favor and pick up the Best Buy 10% off coupon in the USPS ""Mover's Packet"". If it is a newer version packet the coupon can be used both in-store and online.  Note, I've heard that it can be hit and miss. Some USPS Offices just tell people to do it online, but mine asked me how many packets I wanted."

consoledeals,2wtxeq,DealsPoster,2,Mon Feb 23 03:07:28 2015 UTC,If you are a Best Buy rewards member you should check your email for a 10% off a single item coupon. I brought this in to Best Buy today and picked this up! But once they scanned the free Playstation TV it removed the 10% coupon. But they override it because its not an actual TV which is an exclusion mentioned on the coupon. But it worked!
consoledeals,2wtxeq,leoislucky,1 point,Mon Feb 23 04:29:56 2015 UTC,Would there be a way to price match this with the deal Target is having where it's any PS4 bundle for 10% off?

Either about 343 and how they're the devil, or about how the bitching has killed the sub. Single player fans left to /r/halostory because the anti 343 circlejerk derails story conversation.

consoledeals,2w7jf4,Nofxious,2,Tue Feb 17 17:24:28 2015 UTC,"Depends how many and what kind of games you buy, and where your nearest Best Buy is.  For someone such as myself, it's utterly invaluable.  As of Friday, my total savings for 2015 will hit $33.44, which is $3.44 in real savings over the price of this two-year membership with over 22 months to go. (I already had the membership prior to this sale, but I'm using the calendar year period 2015–2016 as an example.)  But let's say you only buy a game every two months.  That's 12 games and a potential discount of $144.  But circumstances vary.  What if four of those games are new $60 titles, four are used titles at $25 each, two are new Vita games and two are new 3DS games?  Then your actual discount is only $88.  Now suppose if you hadn't bought from Best Buy, you could have found four of the new titles on sale at other retailers for $5 off.  Now your actual discount is only $68.  And suppose Best Buy is two miles farther out than other retailers.  You'll pay about an extra $10 for gas over those two years.  So your actual discount is now only $58, from which you have to deduct the price of entry — $30 — making your real savings $28.  Even then that's nothing to sneeze at, but a person also has to account for their time and what that's worth to them too.  And this is for a person buying 6 games a year in varying prices and conditions.  If you buy even fewer games, and/or are patient for sales, and/or rarely buy new, and/or stick to portables, and/or live far away from Best Buy, you're more likely to be near the break-even point, or even underwater on the deal.  Some people are also willing to pay more for the convenience of a digital collection.  And for people who fall into these categories, it's not dumb at all to pass on this."
consoledeals,2w7xoa,lKenV,15,Tue Feb 17 18:46:28 2015 UTC,"Ehh, to be honest I'd consider that ""very good condition"" assuming it works perfectly fine.   I mean, when you say it's in pristine condition aside from one minor cosmetic blemish, I'd call it ""very good"". If it said ""like new"" that'd be different."

consoledeals,2w7xoa,dotherussell,1 point,Tue Feb 17 21:35:42 2015 UTC,"I'm agreeing that it is in very good condition when it comes to the device condition section rating. However in the additional comments it should've been noted when others listed minor scratches & stuff. If an additional comment says ""very good condition"" I wouldn't really expect anything wrong with the system. I'm just being nitpicky for the sake of the review really. I'm not too bothered by it since it doesn't effect how the system runs, but it is something I wish the tester listed as there was another very good condition system listed w/ no comments that I could've possibly gotten instead. (i specifically remember picking this system because of the additional comment)"
consoledeals,2w7xoa,zambezy,2,Tue Feb 17 22:59:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the write-up, I've always been wary of Cowboom but this makes me a little less concerned. I think they should have listed that there was a chip on the corner and would probably just call it ""good"" condition, as it seems to be very noticeable and more than just a scratch.  Let us know if there are any problems down the road!"
consoledeals,2w7xoa,PS3s,2,Tue Feb 17 22:53:30 2015 UTC,"Will do! & thank you. I was very skeptical too. & yeah it is just a dent to some people & that they still consider it in very good condition, but the important part is it looks like it was dropped on the corner so there could possibly be internal damage. So it is something that should've been mentioned. I wanted to be as thorough & nitpicky as possible, so I'm planning on doing an update edited in once I use longer."

If you do buy the PS+ and a PS store card you do get 20% off the store card (I believe this is what OP meant) but if you buy digital content it's basically free money.

consoledeals,2vhmrw,FoxK56,1 point,Wed Feb 11 14:53:57 2015 UTC,"This past weekend I did the Best Buy ""trade in a qualifying PS3, get $150 toward a PS4"" even though I have had a PS4 since launch. I brought in my PS3, got my credit, picked the The Last of Us PS4 bundle, and bought it for about $275 after tax. I took that bundle across the street to Target and said I wanted to exchange it for an Xbox One bundle since I already had a PS4; I didn't tell them I bought it at Best Buy, but it was unopened so there's no reason for them not to exchange it. I got the AC Unity One bundle for ~$350 and got the difference on a target gift card. I used that to buy another controller and game.  So at the end of the day, I basically paid $275 and traded in my PS3 for a new Xbox One Unity bundle, 2nd controller, and about $25 toward a game (Forza Horizon 2). You could do the same with this deal at GameStop. Just don't open the PS4 bundle and go to Walmart or Target, since they don't require a receipt to exchange."

(It's almost recommended you play again as plastic man)  And as for random characters, there are way too many count.  You get black canary, Nightwing, Superboy and Geoff Johns & Kevin Smith.

consoledeals,2v6t4a,jobst526,2,Sun Feb 8 13:07:20 2015 UTC,I got a similar deal on black Friday. These are eligible for a 3 year extended warranty for $70. Highly recommend. To purchase the warranty you will need to call though. The serial numbers dont work to purchase online.
consoledeals,2v6t4a,DCTiger5,0,Sun Feb 8 15:54:49 2015 UTC,Can't you buy one new for $350 without the Kinect? I have the Kinect for xbox360 and it just sits there.
consoledeals,2v6t4a,DMS0205,8,Sun Feb 8 13:35:17 2015 UTC,Don't base your kinect opinions on the 360 1. Kinect for 360 was garbage. Totally different  story with the kinect 2.0
consoledeals,2v6t4a,evilrastan,5,Sun Feb 8 14:32:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I use it for voice chat/commands and scanning QR codes, it's pretty cool and feels like a quality piece of hardware"
consoledeals,2v6t4a,SySTeMaT1c,0,Sun Feb 8 15:15:33 2015 UTC,"I have read some reviews on it but still seems to not be all that good.  Also now that Microsoft has chosen to not include it with the console, a lot people think it is dead.  Now game studios don't have to include kinect features as some people will not have it.  The voice commands sound cool but I am really not into that and don't feel that I need an extra component for this. IMO, Microsoft could have put this on the control itself (and rechargeable batteries cheap f*cks) to have this feature."
consoledeals,2v6t4a,DMS0205,3,Mon Feb 9 03:14:55 2015 UTC,I  disagree.. The Xbox one kinect is a great product that doesn't compare to to the Xbox 360 kinect

The 2nd one is for those that don't want to use Kinect or their equipment is inside a cabinet. However, you'll need to purchase an IR blaster cable like this one... http://www.monoprice.com/Product?c_id=109&cp_id=10110&cs_id=1011009&p_id=8059&seq=1&format=2"

I'm ready to buy a Wii U as soon as the right deal comes along. No NEED to do it right now since I'm neck deep in The Last of Us on PS3, but if I could get this today I might have done it.   The eBay deals selling it new for $260 are also tempting me, but they're all sold by antonline which I've never heard of and supposedly specialize in refurbed products, and I'd rather buy legitimately new rather than ""new."""

Edit2:  comment from youtube (yea I know its a youtube comment)   Hahahahaha is this a joke?

It got way too difficult way to fast for my kids (8 and 6) so they don't play it anymore, and I have no real desire to play it either. I'd save my money if I were you.  Edit:  In case you didn't know, it isn't made by Media Molecule (the maker of the first two) but is made by a different studio instead. We liked the first two but this one just seems to not have the same charm, and gets really complicated with all the different abilities and tools and such. We're not too much into the creation aspect of it though so can't comment on that. We only tried the built-in campaign."

I've played it a whopping four times for all of a total of maybe 90 minutes, and all four times I've been disappointed (although admittedly I have no one to play with).

consoledeals,2uou1r,FaFaFlooey,4,Wed Feb 4 00:43:48 2015 UTC,site looks kind of sketch. is it legit and safe?
consoledeals,2uou1r,_GreyFox,2,Wed Feb 4 01:54:52 2015 UTC,They have a PayPal purchase option. I would use that if you have it available and you're worried about it being legit. That way you can dispute it and get a refund if anything goes wrong pretty easily.   I purchased the choose 1 of 4 game pack and was in and out in a few minutes without any problems. So it seems safe to me at least.

consoledeals,2uou1r,idleactivist,3,Wed Feb 4 05:26:41 2015 UTC,Site looked sketchy but I saw that they accepted PayPal so I gave it a shot (I'd dispute the payment if I had issues) I got my voucher code immediately after clicking the link from their email to verify the order and had zero issues on Sony's redemption site.

I consistently have a party of people that I can do the Weekly Strikes and Nightfalls with. So I can't recommend that enough.

consoledeals,2uj0r2,Savedme2,1 point,Tue Feb 3 02:43:47 2015 UTC,"Please elaborate. I'm not interested in this deal, but I'm sure everyone can benefit from your anecdote and avoid if things aren't up to snuff."
consoledeals,2uj0r2,dark_delight,7,Tue Feb 3 04:03:04 2015 UTC,"Okay so it's a bit long but I'll try to format it to where it's not awful to read.  I pre ordered 3 ps4 games from Dell when they had a similar sale (shadow of mordor, the evil within, and advanced warfare) so I paid around $200 after tax and everything.  The first game to came out I got about a day after release which wasn't an issue but the problems started upon the second game's release.  I got the evil within a week after release date which I feel is not acceptable but I wasn't about to make a big deal of that. Then some time went by and I didn't receive my promotional gift card so I reviewed the terms.  Basically you are supposed to get a code in an email 10-20 days after the item ships and it had exceeded that time frame so I decided to call Dell.   I talked to someone and they assured me that I would get my gift card the next day. More time goes by, still no gift card. I had to call them 3-4 times and finally received the three after advanced warfare came out.  Now the next set of problems, I now have 3 $25 gift cards for Dell, but their pricing is pretty bad. I mean worse than walmart's. They have games amazon and best buy list at $30 for $60 so I decided to wait for a deal to use them.   Too bad they are only good for 90 days, now they were coming up on expiration and I decided it was time to use them before it was too late so I went online to order a $50 playstation plus subscription and 2 $18 and it said I needed to call to use more than once gift card.  So I call and talk to someone (by the way their automated system isn't very good and it took me to the wrong department literally every time I spoke to them) and he goes on to yell me I can only use three forms of payment (like 3 gift cards or 2 gift cards and a credit card)  So I had to split up the purchases and it was a huge hassle.  TL;DR: Dell will never get my money again."

EDIT: Sooooooooo - I got the system, all the hardware looks really great, so far its up an running no issues. Only problem is, I bought the Destiny Bundle, AND THERE IS NO DESTINY GAME. Amazon told me sorry but because it was used there is nothing they could do. I ended up wheeling and dealing with them to pay for a digital download (most of it). I am a bit disappointed but I felt committed to it now so that I could play some Destiny. Overall not horrific but I don't know if I would go back to AWD for a console deal."
consoledeals,2ul5sk,Fozee,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:12:04 2015 UTC,"I did the same and got a very, very faulty PS4. But from what I've read, Sony will not honor their own warranty if you've bought pre-owned, so I sent it back. It was worth the gamble."
consoledeals,2ul5sk,casdmc,1 point,Wed Feb 4 02:34:01 2015 UTC,How could you tell it was faulty? Was it very noticable?
consoledeals,2ul5sk,Fozee,1 point,Wed Feb 4 04:25:53 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. It would turn itself on randomly, and the drive fix didn't work. It would turn off in the middle of games, no errors, just turned off. It also had to rebuild its data a couple of times in the 2 weeks I had it.   I didn't get a replacement from Amazon, I just decided to get a refund (which took about a week, understandably) and bought a new one. I got it for like $80 off though, so it was worth the try."

consoledeals,2uhdrg,snowbell55,2,Tue Feb 3 18:59:00 2015 UTC,This is a really good deal especially given you need PS+ for most online play on the PS4.
consoledeals,2uhdrg,chandleross,3,Mon Feb 2 15:33:45 2015 UTC,I see. I don't have much experience with the ps4 yet. I like what I have played so far. I actually played my brother's ps4 and realized how much better it is than the xbone. I just sold my xbone to get a ps4.
consoledeals,2uhdrg,smashedasshole,1 point,Mon Feb 2 16:04:47 2015 UTC,"I just got a ps4 too, and have been wondering whether I should have gone for the XBoxOne  Could you share how you found the PS4 to be better, it would help cull my buyer's remorse"
consoledeals,2uhdrg,dbmichell2,1 point,Mon Feb 2 18:25:24 2015 UTC,"I thought the graphics were a little better and the controller to be smoother and more comfortable. I also like the exclusives that the ps4 will have.  Additionally, I became tired of the problems I had with my xbone not wanting to load games and randomly freeze. Often, I had to unplug the power cord and turn the console back on in order to be able to play my games."

consoledeals,2uhdrg,Logical_Phallusy,1 point,Tue Feb 3 18:59:44 2015 UTC,Man! That's bull crap! I think the deal would be even better if last of us was a physical copy. But free Psn is cool!
consoledeals,2uhdrg,meandrunkR2D2,3,Mon Feb 2 05:19:21 2015 UTC,"It is awesome. Not as great as the deal from a few days ago where you got The Last of Us and Dying light for $430, but still decent.  I barely noticed the free psn. They don't even advertise it. You have to click on the product listing to find that."
consoledeals,2uhdrg,dbmichell2,1 point,Mon Feb 2 08:03:13 2015 UTC,I believe this deal is better honestly.   PS Plus is $50 and Dying Light is $60  Thanks for sharing :)
consoledeals,2uhdrg,junyah54,1 point,Mon Feb 2 08:26:17 2015 UTC,Hopefully there will be a PS plus deal soon. If I can get it cheaper I would be really happy.
consoledeals,2uhdrg,JasonDeSanta,1 point,Mon Feb 2 13:12:18 2015 UTC,A great deal indeed. I just wanted dying light in the same package. The deal made even sweeter considering I was able to get Battlefield 4 for $14 dollars just the other day (which I was able to find through a post on this site).  And no problem!
consoledeals,2uhdrg,dbmichell2,0,Mon Feb 2 14:15:35 2015 UTC,"Aside from reselling it, why is a physical copy better?"
consoledeals,2uhdrg,JasonDeSanta,1 point,Mon Feb 2 05:43:17 2015 UTC,Reselling is the only way that it would be better in my personal opinion.   But not having to pop games in and out constantly when you want to play another game is huge to me since I enjoy being lazy when playing games.
consoledeals,2uhdrg,junyah54,1 point,Mon Feb 2 06:22:43 2015 UTC,I would have resold mine. Or traded it in to Gamestop.
consoledeals,2uhdrg,JasonDeSanta,-2,Mon Feb 2 13:10:49 2015 UTC,Takes up less hard drive space.
consoledeals,2uhdrg,junyah54,1 point,Mon Feb 2 13:45:17 2015 UTC,Wrong.  Both physical and digital games take the same amount of hard drive space. Games no longer work like they did on PS3. Games need to install everything from disc to hard drive in order to work.  So the only difference is the disc itself.
consoledeals,2uhdrg,JasonDeSanta,1 point,Mon Feb 2 14:30:27 2015 UTC,And being able to trade-in the physical copy is a plus too.
consoledeals,2uhze8,italkgames,3,Mon Feb 2 08:27:20 2015 UTC,"Someone in the Xbox One subreddit said this site looked sketchy so let me copy and paste what I wrote there before someone loses out on a good deal:  Shop Rite is a supermarket on the East Coast this is just their online site. http://www.shoprite.com/ hitting ""Shop Online"" takes you to that shopritedelivers site.

consoledeals,2u659c,CaspianX2,2,Fri Jan 30 05:44:45 2015 UTC,"My personal recommendations this week:  Well, firstly, unless you've been living under a rock, you know how eagerly Wii U owners have been awaiting the Wii release of Metroid Prime Trilogy (Wii), the digital version of a Wii game that had a limited production run and as a result was one of the most expensive Wii titles to get ahold of. It also happens to be a collection of three of the best games Nintendo has put out in the last decade or so. The first Metroid Prime, in and of itself, is still ranked #11 on Gamerankings list of highest-rated games of all-time, and that's only a third of this collection! And to answer the question that's inevitably coming, yes, you will need to get a Wii remote and numchuk to play it. But please do not let that stop you - we're talking about a game that is not only one of the finest titles Nintendo's ever produced, it also happens to be by far one of the best deals of 2015 so far.  If you've never played Super Mario Kart (SNES), now is a good time to pick it up. It definitely shows its age, but it's still an excellent game that's stood the test of time.  And for those looking for something newer, Mario Kart 8 is, in my opinion, the best game in the series if you're looking for pure cartoony racing goodness. The gameplay is damn near perfectly balanced, the graphics are some of the most beautiful of the current generation so far (yes, even next to PS4 and Xbox One games). If it wasn't for the fact that the Battle Mode just outright sucks, this would be the perfect Mario Kart game.  Also, among all the Curve titles, many of which are superb, I have to extend my love to Thomas Was Alone. The graphics are as simple as it gets, the gameplay isn't anything especially new or extraordinary, and the game is really short for the price they're asking. Why the hell would I recommend it, then? Because it is one of the most beautifully-told stories I have experienced in a game in a very long time, and one that makes good use of the video game medium. You might want to compare the pricing for this against what it goes for right now on other platforms (I haven't checked), but please please please get it on one platform or another - this simple, unassuming game is one of the most beautiful pieces of art I've come across in a good while."
consoledeals,2u659c,ltllama,1 point,Fri Jan 30 05:45:20 2015 UTC,How are the wii controls for metroid prime? I played the first two back on gamecube but would love to play all 3 if it handles decently!
consoledeals,2u659c,paulwesley91,1 point,Fri Jan 30 15:01:20 2015 UTC,"It's definitely different. It's not bad, and I know a lot of people prefer it. For me, I would have liked to have the option to play the older games with a normal gamepad, but using the Wii remote and numchuk is a decent replacement for that."
consoledeals,2u659c,ev6464,1 point,Fri Jan 30 15:54:52 2015 UTC,"I really like them. It reminds me of PC controls for shooters, except you use the Wii Remote pointer instead of a mouse."

This is the second product that I get from Amazon Warehouse(the first one was a GoPro camera) and again if Amazon have sold it as a new product I would believe. The PS4 came like new, it seems to have never been used actually. The GTA V was factory sealed and the code for The Last of Us digital game was never used. The controller was still with the ""protective plastic"" and all the accessories was in the box. The only thing that didn't came exactly as expected was the cover from the Black Friday bundle that it is missing, they send only the PS4 original box. Anyway, definitely great deal!

Ended running me $321.xx since I was able to add on the Redcard discount and my FIL's team member discount.  Plus I talked the electronics manager to toss in Assassin's Creed Unity for free on top of it all.   Took that $40 and applied it to a 12 month PS+ card (sadly no other discounts worked).  As far as the redcard goes, I have it attached to my checking account so it doesn't hit my credit at all, since it's not a CC, but a debit card.

consoledeals,2tmfqs,enginedown,1 point,Mon Jan 26 07:00:21 2015 UTC,"My Target store was still advertising the GTAV + TLOU bundle from black friday, and since they didn't have any in stock, they also threw in another game of my choice.

I think what you said might be their policy, but if you get someone who doesn't know/care or be persistent with it you will probably be able to get it.

consoledeals,2tiio8,scubacell,1 point,Sun Jan 25 06:34:07 2015 UTC,Yea the guys were totally on point for me. Said they didn't know if they would price match Sears anymore after the Wii u thing haha. Which I also fucking missed! Went to the same damn place and talked to a different guy. I just can't get one of these :/
consoledeals,2tiio8,Thats_an_RDD,2,Sun Jan 25 06:40:31 2015 UTC,"I think that secretly the Sears/Kmart family recognizes that they're not up there with the ""big boys"" and does things like absurd sales with very limited stock and 'glitches' in their pricing just to fuck companies that price match them over. Pretty sure that's why a lot of stores have had to stricten their price match policies. I wish I would've gotten a WiiU too, or a $70 3DS XL bundle ;)"
consoledeals,2tiio8,scubacell,1 point,Sun Jan 25 06:49:41 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking too while I was walking away lol. That and it's kinda put Sears back into relevancy.

consoledeals,2tiio8,scubacell,1 point,Sun Jan 25 07:09:58 2015 UTC,"The first time it was posted it said that BestBuy would price match, so it might be worth a shot. Their policy is very wishy-washy though, so who knows if it will actually work or not. Retailer's price match policies were so lax even as short as a year ago, but after all this crazy sale stuff and other things like misprints, glitches, and hacks I start to wonder if the golden age of discount price matching has passed. I'm glad I was at least able to grab a cheap XB1."
consoledeals,2tiio8,scubacell,1 point,Sun Jan 25 06:57:50 2015 UTC,"O yea forgot about best buy. Luckily my Sears and bb are right down the road from each other. How much you get xb1 for?

Btw they are sold out online AND in stores in my area, but sears website is crap and shows in stock until you try to put it in the cart. As long as they dont click ""add to cart"" you should be fine for the price match.  Walmart price match policy  I posted this on   /r/XboxOneGameDeals also."
consoledeals,2ti2lt,italkgames,4,Sat Jan 24 09:55:02 2015 UTC,Played the trial today. Went through the tutorial which actually tried to teach basic football strategy to you. I'd say it's worth $24 for a digital copy. Good deal for a good game. Played probably 3 hours and can't wait for more.
