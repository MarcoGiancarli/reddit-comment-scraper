Horses,3e3xwg,thevoodoothatyoudo,8,Tue Jul 21 20:26:57 2015 UTC,"These are stunning. As an equestrian artist myself, my only constructive critique is that the proportions are just a little long in a few of the images. I find it helpful to measure the body as I go by using the head as the relative measurement, though you need to change the measurement slightly when accounting for foreshortening and recessing . Otherwise, you are quite talented and creative. Nice job!"

Horses,3e2qj0,Kir10sBlue,11,Tue Jul 21 14:39:12 2015 UTC,"If she is still nursing, I would give her some time before cutting her calories, unless you really think she's in danger of foundering.  Producing milk is a huge calorie burner and it's more common for foals to ""suck all the beauty"" out of their dams--they usually tend to get ribby rather than chubby.  Her body needs those extra calories to be able to sustain her foal in addition to herself. Is it definitely excess weight (fatty deposits over her topline, cresty neck, can't feel ribs) or is it just her post-baby belly?  Is she on very rich pasture during the day?  Consult your vet before making any changes to her diet and ask about how to best bring her back into work.  Otherwise I would sit tight a little longer (again, unless she looks in risk of foundering)."
Horses,3e2qj0,RonRonner,3,Tue Jul 21 14:45:31 2015 UTC,"Hello, equine vet here. First, nice job paying attention to your mare's body condition!  I  cannot think about or discuss your case specifically without seeing your mare.  But in general, I agree that making diet/exercise changes in a broodmare with a foal at her side is risky. As mentioned, nursing is a very calorie intensive job. Baby is going to start exploring other foods soon and you may be planning to wean in another 3 months, at which time a progressive return to exercise or diet may be better timed.  But either way, this is a decision that could really benefit from your vet's input, as far as necessity, timing, and method."
Horses,3e2qj0,drquiqui,2,Tue Jul 21 19:47:36 2015 UTC,"I've been told that keeping them up during the day and turning out at night is actually the correct way. Grass produces sugar during photosynthesis,  which is done during the day. So that means the grass is less sugary when it's nightime as they are not doing photosynthesis.  I don't think starting her in a work out routine now will hurt her any. Just adjust her calorie intake if you see her getting too thin."
Horses,3e2qj0,nopesalot,2,Tue Jul 21 18:06:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/RonRonner in that you can even just make a quick call to your vet to ask their advice on how/when/if you should cut her calories.  That way you can save on the price of a farm call and get accurate advice that won't harm her or her foal.  In my experience, my vets have always been ok with giving advice over the phone, especially if they are familiar with the horse.  They also enjoy not having to make a farm call unless necessary as well."

Horses,3dyq02,freakitikitiki,3,Mon Jul 20 16:51:42 2015 UTC,"What is your price range?   I ride in a Dixieland Gaited Saddle (http://www.dixielandgaitedsaddles.com). They're not just for gaited horses though - they use Steele Trees (http://steelesaddletreellc.com/index1a.html) which have a whole assortment of trees that fit all types of horses, from your narrow TB to your stocky QH or draft and everything in between.   I looooove my Dixieland and I've owned about 4 of them total. So many because I bought for 3 different horses. I only have 1 currently but I'm going to get another eventually.   Dixieland's are high quality, all leather saddles with a ton of options. They're not factory built saddles like some other popular trail saddle brands. They're all hand made, Amish quality saddles. They look fabulous and the owner, Cynthia, is wonderland to work with. You can customize to your hearts content.   Mine is an 16"" endurance model with no horn, dropped rigging, light oil colored with black smooth supracor seat padding. I have trooper fenders, with leather covered endurance stirrups. I have two extra long leather latigo's for enduro-balanced rigging. I have the cheyenne roll on it, and regular tooling. I added coachmen loops on it for extra places to hang stuff while trail riding.   This is my saddle on my mare: http://i.imgur.com/0t7zA3N.jpg & http://i.imgur.com/GtBxHgU.jpg (ignore the discoloration. my mare rolled with me on her in some water, I was wearing dark jeans and had to ride back to my trailer, and I didn't oil it/clean it when I got back to the barn, so my fault) It's pictured with a CSI saddle pad.   As long as they're in business, I plan to buy all my saddles from them. I wouldn't ride in anything else. Check out their website. I know a lot about them (from owning 4 of them!) so feel free to ask me any questions :)  I can also recommend a variety of other trail saddles if Dixieland aren't your cup of tea. :)"
Horses,3dyq02,bearxfoo,2,Mon Jul 20 17:39:15 2015 UTC,"These look great!  Thanks so much for the reply and the info!  As far as budget, I was looking to go less than $1000, but would go up to $1500, so I think these saddles might be just about right, for my price range.  They are beautiful saddles, too.  I am going to look these over and consider the customization options.  Out of curiosity, what are some of the other trail saddles that you could recommend?  Just to give myself options."
Horses,3dyq02,bearxfoo,2,Mon Jul 20 18:24:20 2015 UTC,"Allegany Trail Saddles (http://trailridingsaddles.com/) is another company with great saddles, but a little pricier than Dixieland. They also use Steele Trees. I like the way they look but they've always been out of my price range.   Steele Saddles are okay saddles. Just to be clear, they're NOT the same company as Steele Trees. Two different Steele's, lol. A few friends of mine rave about them but honestly I do not like the way they look so I've never ridden in one and can't give an opinion one way or another. They're VERY pricey. http://steelesaddle.com/  The Imus Gaited saddle is a good trail saddle for a reasonable price. They too use Steele Trees. http://phoenixrisingsaddles.com/ I've never ridden in one but they're ok looking, I would consider buying one.   Synergist Saddles are expensive but I've seen a few here and there and generally, people like them. If I recall correctly, they use a special kind of tree that is supposed to ""mold"" to any horses back, therefore ""eliminating"" saddle fit issues. I think it's hit and miss. http://www.synergistsaddles.com/horse-saddles/custom-horse-saddles/endurance-saddles/  Crest Ridge Saddlery is a good saddle for a decent price but the cheap price tag is related to the fact that their base models are mostly cordura and not leather. If you like the look of cordura, then it's no skin off your back. I use to ride in a cordura Big Horn and while it was ok, I bought my leather saddle for a reason. However, the owner, Debbie, is very knowledgeable and super friendly and she is very committed to making saddles that fit. http://crestridgesaddlery.com/  http://specializedsaddles.com/ is another company but I honestly don't know much about their product to give an opinion. If I recall, however, they're very expensive.   http://www.stonewallsaddles.com/ This is a smaller, not as well known company that makes extremely light saddles but for a price tag.   Of course, you also have your big box factory saddle companies, like Tucker, Circle Y, Abetta, Big Horn, etc.   If you're looking for primary English, your best bet is a dressage saddle or an Australian saddle. I don't ride in either, so I can't say one way or another.   There's probably another dozen or so companies that I know I'm forgetting and can't find much info on. Henry Miller saddles, Orthro-Flex saddles, JJ Maxwell Saddles (http://jjmaxwell.com/saddle/traditional-western-saddle/) and Jay's Custom Saddles (https://www.facebook.com/JaysCustomLeather, a few of my friends ride in their saddles and like them a lot but I'm not a fan).  Hope all this helps! There's so many saddle makers out there.... lol (and of course, out of all these, my vote is a Dixieland. I just love my saddle, lol)"
Horses,3dyq02,bearxfoo,2,Mon Jul 20 18:49:46 2015 UTC,"This is great information, thank you SO much!  I think out of all of them I might actually go with the Dixieland, too.

Horses,3duocn,surefoot_,21,Sun Jul 19 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"No no no no no.  I am half leasing my horse out and our contract specifically states that the Lessee is only liable for vet bills if the injury is from negligence on her part. There is NO reason you should have to pay for the vet bills for a horse you don't own, unless you specifically cause the injury. That's my $0.02 anyway."
Horses,3duocn,wbdane86,6,Sun Jul 19 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, I half lease and am responsible for 0 at the farm and 100% off farm.

Horses,3duocn,MyHorseIsAmazinger,2,Sun Jul 19 20:00:17 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your input this is what I had in mind.  The horse is staying on their property and it was agreed that I am only responsible if the horse is injured as a direct result of negligence on my part.

Horses,3duocn,Picklejuice_Patron,5,Sun Jul 19 20:24:39 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on where the horse is. If they are keeping the horse on their own property, or the same boarding facility they were already at, they should be responsible for anything colic related or similar. If the horse was to get hurt riding that's obviously your problem.  If you are moving the horse to another facility or your own property, I would say you are 100% responsible.   Edit: words"
Horses,3duocn,carbonarbonoxide,2,Sun Jul 19 17:55:39 2015 UTC,great point.  The horse is staying on their property.
Horses,3duocn,mrflossin,3,Sun Jul 19 18:20:00 2015 UTC,"Horse on their property, under their care for feed- their bills.  The last lease I did, I was responsible for most injuries as they pertained to use (ie, if I had to call the vet for cuts or swellings) but the owner paid for ""maintenance"" such as joint injections, and in the event of a colic surgery, because she had insurance on him."
Horses,3duocn,Atomicblonde,3,Sun Jul 19 18:28:13 2015 UTC,"Agree with this. Get insurance on the horse if you can. I once leased a horse, I would never lease again, horrible experience for all involved. The horse was quite nice, but the one thing I learned was really really read the contract and expect all the unexpected possibilities. Other more specific things I learned:  Try before you buy so to speak, and if the horse isn't experienced or if it seems like the owner is trying to pawn the horse off on someone else to get benefits for the horse, you probably shouldn't be paying. A lease is for your benefit, not the lease horses. If they want you to exercise their horse they should be paying you or it should be free.  Figure out what being ""humanely treated"" means specifically and make sure they have little say in the horse's training as long as you work with a decent trainer. I was told that using a figure 8 noseband on my bridle was not okay by the owner even though my trainer was the one who recommended the horse be ridden in it.  Even if you don't plan to show, figure out a show plan, as in you retain exclusive rights to show the horse. The owner of my leased horse treated me like an exercise rider and tried to have other people show her when I was full leasing her and paying for everything for her. On this note also be clear on who can ride the horse. If you are full leasing you should be the only rider.  Get a trainer, if nothing else they can help you back up what you do with the horse. So if the owner asks ""what are you doing jumping my horse without boots on?"" your trainer can stick up for you and say ""It's just one time, and in Hunter they never use boots"". It just helps to have someone in your corner during times of stress.  Personally I would never lease again, it's a good way to start, but when you are leasing someone else's horse you're really putting your finances in their hands, and they can screw you at every opportunity. I found with all the money, blood, sweat, and tears I spent on that horse, it made much more sense for me to just buy my own."
Horses,3duocn,happinessfilled,2,Sun Jul 19 19:57:16 2015 UTC,"Think about duration and what constitutes early termination of the lease. You never want to be stuck in a long lease supporting a horse who will never get sound. Even if its month-to-month, think about terms of cutting of the lease. Also, I didn't see anything about farrier bills. I have usually split those with the owner."
Horses,3duocn,Perry75,2,Mon Jul 20 02:24:48 2015 UTC,"I've had a full lease that said that we were liable for all vet bills, but it made sense because the horse was in our full time care and the owners were 4 states away. Because of this, we got Dietrich equine insurance on him so that we had coverage should some injury or illness occur while he was in our care. That seems a little heavy handed if the horse is on the owner's property and is more of a half lease."

Horses,3droun,silver_slinky,4,Sun Jul 19 05:14:38 2015 UTC,"Lol, agreed completely. No need to be so angry of a person as he is all the time... nor critical."
Horses,3droun,daydreams356,4,Sun Jul 19 07:04:55 2015 UTC,"I was so surprised too! It was such an educational video too, I thought maybe he'd get kicked or something to get that many upvotes.   I have mixed feelings about Rick Gore (i.e. blatant sexism), but beneath all that he really does care for the horses."
Horses,3droun,shh_im_not_here,5,Sun Jul 19 00:18:03 2015 UTC,"He is against a lot of things like even touching a foal. Which seems ridiculous to me. I get the anger against interfering between a mother and her foal, but you need to accustom a horse to the human world. Horses get a lot more dangerous when they are older and its a lot kinder to teach them when they are mold-able than to let go for longer. I deal with mustangs and while they are AMAZING creatures, it is still a hard process for them to cope with humans at an older age. Here is a video at how idiotically sexist he is. This video makes me unfathomably angry. There was no need to lash out at the woman who posted the photo (if you watch the whole video) and there was no need for that level of anger. Educating the lady would have been enough... she didn't know better. But blasting her over 13 minutes and calling her every imaginable word because she put a halter and rope on a foal? Give me a break. He lost every ounce of respect from me in that video. He is also against helmets! Cool dude... because protecting yourself brain injuries from a 1000 lb flight animal is dumb.  I respect the natural horsemanship, but this guy doesn't even do things safely or normally. He is constantly allowing the horse to throw her butt into him and towards him... a big no-no with ANY horse behavior knowledge. I was dishearted to see him as the top video of reddit as there are much better examples of horsemanship from people like Monty Roberts and his joining up or Warwick Schiller dealing with problem horses. But, it was nice to see a horse video like that with positive comments of respect for the horse and how horse training works instead of anti-horsewoman crap you normally see on reddit."
Horses,3droun,daydreams356,3,Sun Jul 19 00:28:03 2015 UTC,"Great, for the next month I'm going to be trying to weasel a Warwick Schiller video to the front in that sub, lol.  I came to one of Rick's videos where he proceeded to whack a horse many times with a lead rope to show some point or other about how to move its feet and how confusing it isn't good practice. He would give the horse signals to follow him, and then purposefully take a wrong step to show what an idiot looks like, to which the horse responded coming into his space, obviously thinking that was what he wanted--- he then would yank and smack the horse around like a nut. I thought, okay we understand.... confusing the horse and whipping it up into a frenzy is bad. You didn't need to demonstrate it. That's like saying Rolkur is bad, and proceeding to train a horse in Rolkur to prove your point-- wtf?"
Horses,3droun,daydreams356,3,Sun Jul 19 00:38:20 2015 UTC,"I've watched hundreds of his videos and been to a clinic and never seen this, but I suppose it happened. He is a little strong to me on some things, but I don't take everything a trainer says to heart as a god's word. I mix it in my little knowledge Chex Mix I pull things out of. I've seen him show an example though and its been an amazing help to me to see what doing things wrong looks like. The horse has dealt with bad training for years so doing a little more isn't a huge backstep. He has been a great help and his videos are easy to understand and a lot cheaper than things like Cinton Anderson. I personally, for example, prefer a horse walking next to me than behind me like warwick likes... but I've usually dealt with hot horses that would happily trample you from behind. However, it does make a big difference to the way a horse thinks of you."
Horses,3droun,shh_im_not_here,3,Sun Jul 19 00:50:13 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that he was against imprinting, like what Clinton Anderson does (putting fingers in mouth, making them lay down, separating from mom). Many people think it causes more stress than needed (like Rick), but others believe (like you) that it makes the horses safer. There isn't one ""right"" way to do anything.  I will disagree that they get more ""dangerous"" as they get older, I got a mustang who wasn't touched until 3 and he was far from dangerous. He did, however, have great socialization skills that humans can't teach. It took longer to gentle him, and was harder in the sense that I had 900lbs to work with instead of 100, but you don't ""need"" to imprint horses. Many people work with older horses very successfully.  That all being said, I'm not vehemently against it like Rick. But I still think there's education to be gained from watching his videos. Yes, he thinks barebacking horses is terrible and helmets instill a false sense of security, but it doesn't mean people can't learn from his ideas if you look past the rage.  My advice would be to research training techniques and go with what you think is correct for you and your horse and go from there. Don't rely on any one person for all your training needs and stay educated."
Horses,3droun,daydreams356,4,Sun Jul 19 00:40:38 2015 UTC,"Horses are dangerous as their size increases, which is what I meant. I've worked with plenty of unhandled horses, though the older a mustang gets the harder they are to gentle typically. From experience, a 9 year old mustang is quite a bit harder to work with then a 3 year old. And this guy, if you watched the video, is against people even touching their foal. ANY touching to him is bad. There are a lot more human friendly horse trainers with the same (if not better) timing, techniques, and passion for horses. His yelling, hate-slurred speeches give nothing good to the horse world."
Horses,3droun,shh_im_not_here,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:44:18 2015 UTC,"This is the vid I'm talking about, seems he's just saying that you shouldn't obsess over the foals or crowd them, not that you shouldn't touch them ever. Correct me if I missed it though. I think he has a point in that it can lead the mare to get uncomfortable, depending on the mare.   You're correct about mustangs though, they tend to develop a strong sense of self-preservation as they get older. My point was though that you don't need to touch a foal within the first week, and that it is pretty easy to break them at 1 and 2 years of age without any contact prior."
Horses,3droun,shh_im_not_here,2,Sun Jul 19 00:52:25 2015 UTC,"I think his older videos were great, the ones where he's just raging about something to prove a point are awful."
Horses,3droun,daydreams356,2,Sun Jul 19 00:20:55 2015 UTC,"He's definitely prone to rage, no argument there!"
Horses,3droun,daydreams356,6,Sun Jul 19 00:27:21 2015 UTC,"I know it was friggen weird! I hate that Rick Gore was at the top though and not someone like Warwick Schiller. Rick has taken some huge cheap shops at women and has always come across a bit oddly to me. Still neat a horse training video was at the front page of reddit, especially considering how anti-horse the mass of reddit always seems to be."
Horses,3droun,desertedcities55,4,Sat Jul 18 21:53:30 2015 UTC,"Oh my god Schiller. He's my favorite! I almost never hear of him from other people though, but his techniques have worked on all my animals.  I'm at least glad Rick Gore's older video popped up. His more recent ones have that grouchy tone to them without much purpose except to rage. A long time ago he blocked one of my Youtube accounts when I tried to tell him arguing with someone on his channel wasn't worth it (in a nice way). I was on his side of the argument even, haha...  It seems difficult to gauge what non horsemen would like, right? What I think is cool, they think is too confusing or boring xD Then this basic stuff comes up and they're all amazed, heh."
Horses,3droun,daydreams356,3,Sun Jul 19 00:19:16 2015 UTC,"I thought this video was super boring... I was actually surprised it was loved so much. I've seen much more impressive examples, but huh... people obviously liked this one! lol"
Horses,3droun,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:52:58 2015 UTC,"It was really boring for us who know how to do it, but for somebody who has no idea what's going on their mind is blown that someone can change a horse's mind without ever touching them."

Horses,3ds57r,brileee,2,Sat Jul 18 22:54:19 2015 UTC,"Epona's Song - born 9:10p Wed, 7/15/15.  Long story short - its been a horrible 72hours but mom and baby have a clean bill of health now.  There was some thoughts that Epona was a dummy foal as she couldn't grasp where to nurse from and appeared to have some cognitive issues.  Vet ended up milking mom and tubing baby to get Colostrom into her.  Took baby another 8 hours to nurse on her own.  Since then she made drastic improvements and is now a royal pain in her mommy's behind- just like she should be.  Mom didn't pass the placenta for 48 hours despite half a dozen doses of Patocin and numerous uterin lavages to try to get it to detach. She finally went into ICU 23hrs after birth where they did more lavages, put her on IV antibitotics and liquids.  After she passed the placenta she had a blockage so got mineral oil from both ends and then more IV fluids.   Finally though both mom and baby have clean bills of health and are coming home in the next couple of hours."
Horses,3ds57r,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:00:48 2015 UTC,"Is she at a breeding farm or vet clinic for foaling, or did you have to just watch and then trailer her to the vet? I'm thinking of breeding my mare in 3-5 years and stories like this kinda scare me off of it. I'm glad everything turned out great!"
Horses,3ds57r,Katara012,2,Sun Jul 19 15:18:53 2015 UTC,"She was at my boarding facility when she gave birth, but after 24hrs we decided to trailer her and baby into the clinic where they stayed for another day and a half or so.   I'll be honest- i'm not inclined to do it again- wayyy too much emotions involved not to mention strain on my bank account.  But if I did it again (I'd eventually like to breed my akal-teke mare a few years down the road) I'd just have her foal at the vet clinic right from the get go. Don't let stories like mine scare you off- the vast majorities of foaling go superbly.  I just happened to be one of the unlucky ones at first.. but we're all good now!"

He is due for a trim, I don't approve of the trim jobs but I can think k of any trimming error which could cause this.  He did just have a chiro visit, but he was fine for a few days after that too..."
Horses,3dt92u,wildfire0858,3,Sun Jul 19 06:05:00 2015 UTC,"To me, it looks like his rear right foot is too short which could make his foot tender.

Not very complicated :)"

Not worth it, imo!

I've learned quite a bit from him, for example he has great barefoot videos and desensitization stuff. Also, his videos are all free on youtube, unlike most ""trainers"" who do just try to sell things. But the whole extreme natural horsemanship (only halters, no bits) I just take with a grain of salt, he's trying to do what he thinks is best for the horses and that's what counts imo."

Every carriage horse I see here is in excellent weight, shiny coats, feet in good condition and quiet and chill about their work and environment.   I stopped by one of the stands the other day and chatted with one of the drivers. He gave me an ear of corn to feed his horse, Lucky, who was a very sweet draft cross. Every carriage horse has to take a mandated 5 week vacation and Lucky's was about to start that Monday, except he was getting a full 2 months off. They have an arrangement to rent pasture from Amish farms out in PA, which is where they seem to get a lot of their horses. I suppose this guy could have been lying to me but the driver really did seem just as into his horse as we are into ours, and he was very attentive to Lucky, fly spraying him as soon as some flies started bugging him.    He seemed proud of how they care for their horses and and their whole industry is under the microscope right now. The horses show no sign of distress from the noise and traffic around them and as for exhaust, they're breathing the same air I do.

Horses,3djxzm,I_Will_Remember,-1,Fri Jul 17 01:05:21 2015 UTC,I used that combo for about 6 months with my guy to help him build a topline without having to constantly fight him. The running martigale was more of a oh shit button then anything else and we kept it on during rides so we could remove the running reins to see if he held the connection. For quite a while my guy liked to go like a camel. At times he would be round then BOOM flip his head up sometimes knocking me in the chest or face. It was not good times.

Horses,3djubq,IndustrialTreeHugger,2,Fri Jul 17 01:04:46 2015 UTC,"It just smells like horse poo. But then without poo. Tbh I don't think it smells that bad? Horse poo and farts are probably the least bad compared to other animals. Maybe rabbits do better I don't know. They just produce a lot of gas because of the way the digest hay and grass... sometimes when they fart I think it's a sign of relaxation..  I don't know what everyone is feeding their horses though.. When they have diarrhea the farts are worse ofc, then they smell like horse diarrhea ...   cat/dog farts are worse, humans can vary. Sometimes it smells as if they're rotten inside and are the worst, sometimes it's just air or something. I think plant eaters probably have the least smelly farts. Cows imo don't really count if they are fed for production of meat and milk, they get a lot more protein and corn and stuff that isn't so great for their digestion system I think ... I gotta stop talking about farts."

HE may think his brand is better than horses, but I assure you it isn't."

Horses,3dcefs,sweetcatofmine,5,Wed Jul 15 12:34:28 2015 UTC,Yep! Eggs and larvae are found in the soil and can attach themselves to a host (you) through skin contact.  http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/sth/index.html  http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/hookworm/index.html

Horses,3dcefs,RonRonner,2,Wed Jul 15 13:32:27 2015 UTC,Didn't think of that. Is it better or worse of its just in our arena and a fresh puddle?
Horses,3dcefs,bearxfoo,4,Wed Jul 15 13:29:50 2015 UTC,"Nah, not really. It's all on a farm where there's ample manure being deposited by animals with a pretty generous parasitic load. I was always warned in particular about hookworms but a little googling (which I don't necessarily recommend) says that there are lots of other kinds of worms you can pick up by walking barefoot in contaminated soil as well. The eggs and larva lay dormant in the soil until a suitable host comes along.  Warm, wet environments seem to increase the risk but areas with reasonably good health care and hygiene seem to mitigate it.  I really wouldn't worry too much about this one time but it's probably not a great practice. Our grandparents who grew up running around barefoot around on family farms were also generally given anthelmintics (wormer) at school or at home as well."

Horses,3d861y,melanieeex3,3,Tue Jul 14 21:02:33 2015 UTC,"Lol, I've collected all of it over the past 10 years I've been riding. I use to work at a horse rescue where I was in charge of training 6 different horses each week so I would find a saddle pad that looked cute on them and then find matching polos and it kind of just escalated from there. The rescue had a donation tack sale where all profits went to the rescue and 90 % of my tack came from that because the prices were really low. I started out riding hunters and then moved to jumpers and that's what I got many different colored polo and splints for. I now do dressage and acquired a schooling bridle and show one. The western pleasure saddle and trail saddle were given to me for free. But honestly I don't need half of all the stuff I have lol but its so hard to part with it"
Horses,3d861y,wildfire0858,2,Tue Jul 14 21:12:44 2015 UTC,Okay that makes A LOT more sense now. In the course of 10 years that doesn't even seem like a lot anymore lol I've only had my horse for one year

I can't even imagine having to stick to an ""I'm allowed to be out of the house x hours a week"" schedule.   Having hobbies is a good thing! Although riding can get rather expensive, it's physical exercise, and gets you out of the house (or your spouse's hair) for a few hours - I don't see why having a spouse that rides is seen as such a huge burden for some people."

For instance I know some Western riders that think that all English riders are stuck up and force their horses into unnatural positions. There are horror stories in every discipline and style of riding.   Yes, ""western style riding"" is weird if you've ridden English your whole life. Someone who has ridden western their whole life will find English very weird as well. Cruel? again, depends on on the person, and is not limited to Western or English."
Horses,3d4fs7,Ejoriah,5,Mon Jul 13 14:52:37 2015 UTC,"I ride one of the ""cruelest"" events. Barrel racing (it's a rodeo event). And I'll be honest. A lot of other girls ride harshly with bit leverage bits that hurt and whip excessively for speed. But there are also plenty of girls who can run the pattern bit less or in a smooth snaffle without kicking the crap out of their horse to make them run faster. Saying one discipline is the worst is really bad. Each of them has their issues and bad riders. You can't judge a whole discipline by a handful of people."
Horses,3d4fs7,dunmorestriden,6,Mon Jul 13 17:06:29 2015 UTC,That is so funny. As some one who has ridden western and english I can tell you both groups can be pretty cruel to horses.   You girlfriend sounds like she is making a lot of assumptions.
Horses,3d4fs7,notantisocial,6,Mon Jul 13 21:04:10 2015 UTC,"The United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) is the governing body for equestrian sports in The United States. The discipline you are most interested in is called showjumping. Here is the URL that will direct you to the 2015 USEF Rulebook. Your girlfriend is making assumptions but could be partially correct. There are bits and training methods that are illegal in the competition ring and on the showgrounds. What someone does while schooling at home is their prerogative but a reputation will follow them throughout the equestrian community if they utilize methods that the rest of the community does not approve. International competitors are subject to the rules and guidelines of the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) and links to the rules in jumping can be found here: http://www.fei.org/fei/regulations/jumping. I would just read the rulebook like professionals do every year. There are also restrictions on drugs/medications and lists of riders and horses that are banned as a result from making violations. Currently, no American riders are under FEI suspension but there are riders from Poland, Lithuania and France: http://www.fei.org/system/files/Table%20of%20Suspensions_0.pdf  Statistically speaking, Americans do a great job of playng by the rules compared to their counterparts on the other side of the ocean. It is also worth noting that when I lived in Europe, I saw horse meat for sale in the grocery store but I do not assume that Europeans are horse killers. Neglect is far worse than slaughter in my opinion, but maybe your girlfriend has a negative stereotype of Americans. If she researched the issues more she would be able to make more educated statements on the sport."
Horses,3d4fs7,NeverendingStarchild,11,Mon Jul 13 18:06:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but she's forming her opinion based on watching a fictional TV show. That would be like Americans basing where you live on the Borat movie or Dracula. Absurd!!"
Horses,3d4fs7,KittenVicious,3,Mon Jul 13 16:51:58 2015 UTC,"I think its weird Heartland was brought up. I don't know if I've seen anything ""Amy"" did that made me cringe (other than hollywood cutting). The main character is actually a very developed horse rider and owns a ranch with cattle. Just as an FYI. You can see her photos on instagram https://instagram.com/amber_marshall_farm/?hl=en"
Horses,3d4fs7,simplyjessi,4,Mon Jul 13 18:19:54 2015 UTC,"I've been riding both English and western since I was about 9, and I'm 17 now. The metal part of the bridle that goes in the horse's mouth is called a bit. The simplest bit that is used on many horses is called a snaffle it. It is joined by a loop in the middle and has free moving rings on either side that attach to reins and are held on by straps that go around the head and behind the ears. The way a snaffle bit works is when you apply pressure it will squeeze the bars of the mouth and apply pressure on the tongue. When a horse is properly trained and ridden correctly you will never have to use more than a very small amount of pressure along with leg cues, or with western riding the bits are RARELY used and horses are mostly neck reined. Horses respond to pressure and as soon as they turn or slow down or stop correctly the pressure is released and they know they did what they've been asked for. However, some people make the decision to use more severe bits or to use bits very harshly on horses. In high stress competitions where there are a lot of horses and the horse gets nervous, a rider may incorrectly opt for a more severe bit (such as a bit with a hackamore. A hackamore is a band that goes around the horse's nose and squeezes it upon applying pressure and can be very painful if used improperly), such as one that is very thin and contains plates that will press hard on the tongue or saw on the edges of the horse's mouth. I would never recommend bits like these.  You can find a lot of horror videos on YouTube of people abusing horses by using very harsh bits on horses that just need a gentle hand and an understanding trainer. A sensible rider will focus on what their horse is telling them through its body language and how it responds to certain tack. I'm not too sure about showing in Europe (also your girlfriend is a showjumper I believe. There are also hunting classes, dressage, etc in the English discipline) but American shows also have rules about what tack you  can present in and what kinds of things are not allowed when pertaining to whips and spurs and unnecessary training devices. But even things such as spurs have good use, for example I was riding with very very small spurs (just tiny rounded metal stubs) when I was 13, for a horse that was being trained with leg cues more so than reins. Anyway if you have more questions feel free to ask."
Horses,3d4fs7,slippers456,2,Mon Jul 13 14:04:23 2015 UTC,"Is it possible she's talking about Tennessee Walking horses doing the ""Big Lick""?  Even though I don't show in Western or English, I don't think either is cruel but IMHO there's no way to spin BL in a positive light."
Horses,3d4fs7,Pablois4,6,Mon Jul 13 19:46:08 2015 UTC,"When people complain about Big Lick walkers, the bit that is used is usually at the very bottom of the list of cruelties involved..."
Horses,3d4fs7,Synaxis,7,Mon Jul 13 21:50:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right.  Big Lick is a horror show and the long shanked bits are the least of it.    I have never heard of the show mentioned by the OP but I guess it's about western riding?  While some western events are not my cup of tea (IMHO Western Pleasure is about as exciting as watching paint dry), overall I don't think it's abusive and have no trouble defending it.  If OP's girlfriend was talking about Big Lick, I'd hang my head in shame to admit that yes, it started & continues to exist in the US."

Horses,3d34mi,simplyjessi,2,Mon Jul 13 03:36:43 2015 UTC,"You could probably find an online retailer that sells fly sheets, masks and leg protectors. Look for a spray that is not a repellent but is actually an insecticide. The repellents are ""natural"" but also don't work at all. When the equine has been sprayed with insecticide, the fly will ingest some upon biting and will die. You can also spray the swarms and it will kill them. Fly predators work well when they are distributed throughout the property in fresh piles of manure in paddocks/pastures. They need to have a food source in order to grow so if they are just released will be ineffective. You can try hanging a bug zapper maybe on the back side of the shed (somewhere where the equine will not chew the electric cord) which will help with mosquitoes at night. I've also used mosquito repellent made for humans on horses because I don't think the mosquito products designed for horses are effective."
Horses,3d34mi,NeverendingStarchild,3,Mon Jul 13 19:07:24 2015 UTC,EDIT: Try to remove the manure from her pen twice a day. The farm I am at now hauls out and spreads manure daily which is very helpful. I suggested online retailer for fly protections sheets etc bc it is generally hard to find products for miniatures in store.
Horses,3d34mi,NeverendingStarchild,4,Mon Jul 13 19:09:49 2015 UTC,"This. No one had said it until you did, but removing the poop is a biggun. For mosquito control, keep the grass cut and routinely clean all water buckets/troughs- put some goldfish in the trough to eat larvae!! If you have ponds or wet ground though, you're fighting an uphill battle.  Also, OP, I use human mosquito spray on my horse because most sprays suck."
Horses,3d34mi,carbonarbonoxide,2,Mon Jul 13 19:30:46 2015 UTC,"I can't help you with mosquitoes, but I've known a couple of people who have used fly predators and been very happy with the results from them."
Horses,3d34mi,Synaxis,2,Mon Jul 13 04:40:58 2015 UTC,I feel like I've read about that in a horse magazine now that I'm seeing the website. That's definitely something to think about. Thank you!
Horses,3d34mi,AtomicPenny,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:13:42 2015 UTC,"Every barn I have been at with fly predators has been absolutely miserable, so ymmv. I have read plenty of reviews where people say they are greatest thing ever, but I have never heard a first hand experience where one positive thing was said about them. Maybe they are more effective in certain regions or something like that."
Horses,3d34mi,TurbulentDescent,2,Mon Jul 13 13:49:57 2015 UTC,"I think if you sprinkle them around and expect a miracle you're going to be disappointed. They're a part of controlling flies, not an all in one solution. I use predators, traps, and pick up and compost the manure and a bad fly day is maybe 6 of them buzzing around my mare. People without animals usually have more flies than me.  I personally have also found Fly Predators to work better than their competitor, Fly Eliminators. Like you say though, YMMV."

Horses,3d2lvi,Allyz0r,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:21:43 2015 UTC,"Hahaha yeah I think if I owned a horse or rode more frequently, I'd be spending that $250 fast, but I only have 1 hour lesson per week in between school and work so I really don't know what I'd use that much money on... I don't show or want to do anything competitive. I don't need any actual horse tack or food, and I don't think I need $250 worth of more breeches lol. I literally don't know what else I could justify buying. I mean I could hold on to it and I'm sure one day in my life I'll spend $250 there again but money is tight so I'd rather not... I considered going in and asking if they'd refund my ~$300 purchase and re-ring it with the gift card but that seems rather tacky and presumptuous when I've already been riding in the stuff for a month... I tried to offer it to my instructor (that's 6 weeks of lessons!) but she didn't want it.  First world problems, right?!"
Horses,3d2lvi,NeverendingStarchild,2,Mon Jul 13 01:25:30 2015 UTC,Gloves? Crop? Grooming tools? Fly spray? Saddle pad? If you stick with the sport you will easily be able to spend that $250 down the road. I started riding again and thought that I would not want to go back to jumping. It has been 7 months. I have been to a show and am jumping 3' courses. In life we often end up doing things that we did not think we would end up doing is my point. Give it time!
Horses,3d2lvi,hoofbeats,2,Mon Jul 13 19:13:27 2015 UTC,"My instructor provides crops, grooming tools, fly spray, and a humongous pile of saddle pads. :) I suppose gloves might be a good idea though.  What do they help with? Grip? I thought we weren't supposed to really grip tightly on the reins?"
Horses,3d2lvi,NeverendingStarchild,2,Mon Jul 13 19:32:08 2015 UTC,"Gloves are very nice! In the heat they prevent sweaty reins from giving you huge blisters and in the winter provide some relief from the cold. If you ever start lunging gloves are a nesecity. I'd also invest in your own crop. My barn provides them as well but they get gross and break over time and it feels nice to have one you picked out yourself. Also an extra pair or two of britches are nice, so if you forget to do laundry one week you can still have clean pants! (Or that might just be an issue for me! )"
Horses,3d2lvi,melonmagellan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:33:14 2015 UTC,"As the horses you start to ride get more athletic and the riding work you do gets more complicated then gloves become a necessity. I'm in AZ and the sweat factor is real. The reins get so slippery and the horses I ride like contact so I like having an extra layer of skin. Plus if something freaky happens then I won't get rein or rope burn. I've always taught and have been taught to keep the fingers closed on the reins then tighten the fist when asking for a half half, downward transition or other kind of adjustment."

Horses,3d1qbu,genuinely__curious,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:29:17 2015 UTC,"I think your theory is valid. She is moving away from unwanted contact. We use cruppers usually on ponies for hunter/jumpers because the ponies sometimes do not have withers to keep the saddle back. However, sometimes the ponies have a bucking response to the crupper so I would test it out before taking him/her out on the trail. Have you tried desensitizing the mule? I'm think that you could maybe lunge him or her at a slow trot in the tack minus the load and over time the mule would get used to the feeling. I have two weeks of backcountry experience with horses/pack horses and  do not have access to the photos I took so I am relying on memories from awhile ago. I think that some of our pack animals only had breastplates. Is it possible to pack her without the britchen or does her confirmation require one? If the withers are no well pronounced it will be annoying to have to readjust the pack after every decline but might be the only option if the mule doesn't get accustomed to the tack. I remember that the deck we used was wood and had two horns that made an x on the front/pommel and back/cantle so that when the load was on then the handles would go over the horn that was furthest away. Then we would use a rope technique to secure the load as high up as possible and never maxed out either pannier past 70 lbs (140 lbs total). It was a rather simple set up compared to my Google image search of britchen. Do you have a picture of the current set up?"
Horses,3d1qbu,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:17:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. The saddle you're referring to is called a saw buck and is primarily used for donkeys. We have one of those but it does not fit our mule. The ""rope technique"" most commonly used is called a ""single man diamond hitch"". We are using a decker. I do not have pictures of our set up but I'm thinking to take some and re-post this.  We just got back from packing her about 15 miles total. She didn't have a bad response to the crupper mentally but it did start to rub her raw so I took it off.  She did really well most of the way home but  on any down hill she basically crow hopped about every ten paces because of the britchen.  Never bucked but she sure didn't like it.    As a mule who has a skinny front end, a wide belly, and hardly a wither, the saddle naturally wants to ride up on to her neck.    I think more miles or desensitizing is the way to go as the saddle does not appear to be hurting her after 15 miles."
Horses,3d1qbu,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:27:44 2015 UTC,Hopefully she settles in over time! Desensitizing seems to be the way to go.   Is her belly wide enough where a back cinch could used instead of the brichen? Might end up being more of a bucking strap than the brichen. Would the load shift more or less if it was positioned higher on her back or lower by her sides? Sorry not my area of expertise but pack equines are amazing and I enjoy brainstorming solutions. My trip was back in 2006 and I remember the horses having to put their hindend so far under them that their hocks would touch the ground on some of the descents.

Horses,3ctp5y,LilyIsHotterThnRobin,5,Fri Jul 10 19:21:36 2015 UTC,"Do you have a bill of sale from when you bought the horse?  I would actually consider cross posting this to /r/legaladvice, as it basically sounds like a legal property and contract issue, the type of stuff whole law school classes are built around.    It sounds like the papers you're referring to are breed registration papers, right?  Was there any sort of written contract or bill of sale drafted up by your mother?  I would definitely play nice for now--this dude who has your horse can pretty easily make her disappear.  You need his cooperation until you are absolutely sure you have the law on your side.  From his point of view, he could potentially claim she was abandoned property.  Has anyone from your side been contributing to her expenses at all?  All I know is that there are a lot of nuances to this stuff--""Possession is 9/10s of the law"" and all that.  You may very well need a lawyer.  http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/possession-is-nine-points-of-the-law/   Even if a person is the rightful owner of the property but has no possession over it, the person who is in possession will be in a better position should the property ever be subject to challenge. This is especially true with adverse possession. However mere possession alone does not grant the possessor rights in the property superior to those of the actual owner. This adage “possession is nine tenths of the law” is not a law but a logical rule of force that has been recognized across ages.   ie, lawyer up"

Papers alone are not proof of ownership. He cannot, legally, sell the horse to recoup board. He can sue you, though. I would calculate the amount of board you would owe (particularly if there was some sort of written or verbal agreement, though a judge may take into consideration average local board when calculating fees/fines) and if that number is greater than $2,000 pay the $2k and remove your horse to a different location immediately.

Horses,3ctp5y,rhapsodyknit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:39:37 2015 UTC,registration papers don't prove ownership unfortunately.
Horses,3ctp5y,Orthonut,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:04:21 2015 UTC,"There's that old saying that possession is 9/10ths of the law, or something like that.  I'm not sure how true that is, but given that he has possession of your horse IF you went to court you would have to explain how she ended up in his care and IF you have not paid for any of her care during that time, you probably would be ordered to pay SOMETHING back.    Also, as much as I hate to say it, registration papers give you very little bargaining power.  They're good for your case, but I have sold several horses whose registration was never changed from my name.  I do not legally own those horses, the paperwork is just a formality."
Horses,3ctp5y,windsor81,0,Sun Jul 12 02:19:01 2015 UTC,If there was no bill of sale I'd say she is still legally yours as long as you have the bill of sale under your name. I believe you could also go to the local police and claim that he has stolen it as long as she is legally in your name. But I'd ask a lawyer first.
Horses,3ctp5y,dunmorestriden,6,Fri Jul 10 20:31:06 2015 UTC,"You could own a horse, board it, and then stop paying board. The barn can then legally do whatever they want, including selling it, if the horse has been abandoned there and they try to recoup costs. The horse becomes the barn owners prooerty, official sale or not. It's an extremely common clause in boarding contracts.  My question in OPs case is what kind of paperwork was exchanged and what sort of money changed hands? Assuming no hard paper trail of contracts or receipts I would lean toward the barn owner getting the leg up, he has technically been caring for the horse, and if OP didn't even know that this horse had been bred twice, he could probably go up with an abandonement story pretty easily. Signed contracts are ALWAYS a must to protect both parties.   OP has left out a huge amount of information in her post though. There is no way for us to do anything besides assume or speculate."
Horses,3crrev,komal021,4,Fri Jul 10 06:26:53 2015 UTC,Worth mentioning he's only a month-old foal. He doesn't appear to have dwarfism so I have no doubts he will grow well out of contention for any kind of 'smallest horse' titles at adulthood.

Horses,3cqqu2,taxtaxtaxxx,13,Fri Jul 10 00:42:36 2015 UTC,"If you're in Texas go to feedlots that are going to ship horses to slaughter. You can find a well trained hunter jumper, papered horses, babies, older horses. Any breed or color. And they need saving more than a horse at a rescue in my opinion. There's a face book page called Auction Horses South that regularly posts horses at feedlots that are about to be shipped for slaughter."
Horses,3cqqu2,dunmorestriden,3,Fri Jul 10 00:54:31 2015 UTC,"That is a really good idea, thank you. I've never been to a horse auction before - Do you know if there would be anyway to get them vet checked before purchase? Or do you just have to wing it and make your best guess? Thanks again."
Horses,3cqqu2,dunmorestriden,4,Fri Jul 10 01:13:38 2015 UTC,"If your vet would be willing to go to a feedlot and just look at the horse I think you could just to check there aren't lameness issues or serious conformation defaults if you don't know much about good conformation. But to be honest most feed lot horses will have something like a cold or a cough that can be cleared up easily. They may need some groceries before being ridden but not always. It really depends on what you find. You can find the horses that kind of make sense for being there, horrible conformation, illness, injuries, age. (Does not mean that they should be there it just makes more sense why they are.) And you'll find papered proven horses, some show horses, kids horses, someone's horse that they obviously loved and took very good care of but didn't truly know who bought their horse. I would do research, know if you have a place that you can quarantine for 30 days just to be sure no other horses get sick."
Horses,3cqqu2,dunmorestriden,4,Fri Jul 10 04:59:51 2015 UTC,"Also don't go to the auctions, go to an actual feedlot. Well you can go to an auction but there are already tons of horses at a feedlot that may have less than a day before being shipped off. Like just the other day 3 colts all under the age of 3 that were Dash to Fame (very expensive proven barrel stud) bred that were in danger of being shipped. I think only two got saved even with their breeding..."

A lot of the younger ones come from breeders who have died and the families don't know what to do with the animals so they just auction them off."
Horses,3cqqu2,Greenjourney,3,Fri Jul 10 05:08:19 2015 UTC,"Hi, horse rescue volunteer here!  Horses that are well-trained in a certain discipline and that are sound are not unheard of at shelters/rescues, but it's pretty rare. It would be much more feasible to adopt a youngish broke horse with the right conformation, then pay to have it trained as a hunter-jumper. The downside of this is that you'll have to wait a few months before you can compete. The great part about this is that your trainer can work with you AND the horse, so you have a much better handle on how the horse responds. Buying a totally pre-trained horse is kind of like buying someone else's used cell phone-- it has apps, wallpapers, pics, ringtones, alarms, and other features pre-programmed that you may not like (or even know about until it's too late).  Of course, just like with small animals, there are also some ""rescues"" that are really hoarders, horse dealers, or insane people. I'm guessing Houston SPCA should be just fine, but it wouldn't hurt to read some reviews and ask around locally.  If, in the end, you ""shop"" instead of ""adopt,"" don't beat yourself up too much. It's OK to buy when you need a working horse or dog for a specific sport or profession. You can always adopt later."
Horses,3cqqu2,Synaxis,2,Fri Jul 10 18:46:13 2015 UTC,"I would not advise going to kill auctions or pulling from a feedlot unless you are willing to take on a horse that could potentially become a serious project, more than you bargained for. It might sound like a really great thing but there are risks involved, just like with adopting a dog from a shelter. If you want to risk getting in over your head with a horse that might be too much for you or might have serious behavioral, soundness, health, or training issues and you will have to deal with quarantines and such. If you don't mind that risk and you have the experience to deal with and evaluate a horse like that, go for it! But most people probably aren't suited for this, which is why I mention it.  The local SPCA where I live doesn't really do horses. However I do volunteer for a rescue and we do all that hard stuff for you.. Our horses are fully evaluated, UTD on shots, teeth, farrier, etc. and if an adopter ever has a problem with the horse, needs advice, needs help, needs to return the horse, the rescue will help and provide a safety net in the event the home can no longer keep the horse. This would be my recommendation if you wanted a rescue - go through a registered nonprofit that has already evaluated the horses and gotten them UTD on the things they need. They can help you find a horse that is suitable for you and your goals the first time."
Horses,3cqqu2,singcoralfang,3,Fri Jul 10 20:28:44 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is to find a horse that will suit your needs and and one whose needs you can meet. I suggest considering all your options carefully. Adopting a horse is not a bad idea, neither is buying one. Some things to know about adopting a horse from the HSPCA 1)you must fill out an application and be approved as an adopter before you can even see the horses in person 2)getting approved means providing name and contact information for the vet and farrier you will use, as well as the address where the horse will be kept. So those are some thing to consider. Getting approved isn't a problem as long as you can provide that information and they can contact those professionals for confirmation.  *Source - I worked at the HSPCA for years. I'm sure you'll find a lovely horse wherever you look, happy hunting!"

I cannot even begin to tell you how many people went off on their own and bought a horse, only for it to have a problem that a trainer or someone else who was more knowledgeable than them could spot. Hell, most of the trainers I know currently still prefer to take someone with them just to have a second set of eyes."

Horses,3cq7w9,IneptInvalid,3,Thu Jul 9 22:09:57 2015 UTC,"It needs to stay a 3 sided shelter so that it does offer actual protection from the elements.   I think 7'x10' is big enough for a nice small shelter-- and the snugness of that will offer more warmth from the horses body heat in the winter.  Use the other parts of the shed to store hay and feed in-- stick a wall up on the front of one stall, add a door, lay pallets and wood sheets down on the floor, and you have massive hay/feed/tack storage.  In all truth, the horse probably won't even use it. But they come in handy for throwing hay into when it is raining/snowing/windy outside. Horses aren't animals that like to be trapped in boxes. My two wouldn't use them if their food wasn't inside. Even when it's pissing freezing rain outside, they'd rather be out in their blankets getting soaked.  Edit: 7'x10' is ONLY suitable for a run in shelter. Not as a stall for any extended amount of time! Just to clarify there. :)  Also, good on you for taking the horse in, and I hope you enjoy your new addition! My mare was a free giveaway and she's a wonderful horse even if she is a diva."
Horses,3cq7w9,Ephemeral_Halcyon,3,Fri Jul 10 01:45:57 2015 UTC,"Hi! I think it's really awesome that you're giving a horse a home, too many end up in shelters/slaughter houses. Have you ever owned a horse before?   In my neck of the woods a ""good"" sized stall for a full-grown horse (over 14 hh), is a 12' x 12' box stall. Depending on how big the horse is, 7' x 10' could be a little tight for the horse to be able to fully lie down in and avoid their own manure/urine spots. Keeping a horse 24/7 in a stall that small would be far from ideal...however your horse will have access to a run-in as well. I'd be more concerned how big the run in is, to be honest, since the horse will probably be spending most of it's time out there.  Ultimately this is gonna be a judgement call on your part, I think. Maybe get the horse in and settled, see how the housing situation works for it for a few months, and then decide if you need to change the run-in structure. The other thing to think about is the other stall area will probably be a good spot to store hay, grain, tack, and all the other horse care related stuff."
Horses,3cq7w9,energyequalscake,2,Thu Jul 9 22:30:20 2015 UTC,"I think the shed is ok, but will the horse be ok by itself? Many horses do not like being alone. You may need to get a goat, llama, or small donkey if you don't want to have 2 horses."
Horses,3cq7w9,ellevt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:03:30 2015 UTC,"Does your area experience extreme cold? If you have harsh winters and wind chills are a frequent reality then make sure that the run-in shelter is protected from the direction that the storms most often come in from. For example, with the lake effect snow in Michigan the entrance to run-in sheds are most commonly found on the east side because it is very rare to have the winds come in from the east.  In order for the horses to share body heat, I would recommend removing the middle wall because it would be too tight of a squeeze in 7'x 10' for two horses to get in/out of the space together and sometimes horses get territorial in confined space."
Horses,3cq1zo,what_the_duck29,6,Thu Jul 9 21:25:17 2015 UTC,"I'd say the most important thing to remember is safety. Horses are 1200 lb animals, getting too close to their personal space, and letting them get away with things is just plain dangerous. In everything you do, make sure you are firm.  For basic care I'm assuming you'll get training. Things like mucking stalls, cleaning tack, grooming, etc aren't terribly difficult, but they can be refined. Learn how to shake out shavings from manure, how to identify a wet spot verses dry shavings.   Ask questions! Don't be afraid, one of the things that annoy me most is when people don't ask how to do something. Even if it's something simple as to which one's the water bucket and which one's the feed bucket, it never hurts to ask.  Don't wear sandals. Running shoes work okay, but something with a hard toe is best. Pack a pair of running shoes so you have a back up or something to wear on break. Also, bring rain boots. I can't count the amount of times I went out to the field to catch a horse and came back with my foot covered in mud.   Most people say wear long pants, and this is solid advice. Not going to lie, I have worn shorts to do chores like stall mucking before, and it won't kill you, but in general long pants is a good idea. If you're stacking hay be sure to wear long pants and gloves, unless you like scratches everywhere.   Learn the signs of a sick horse. A horse that is lame will kind of look like how a human limps. If you see a horse constantly biting its sides, pawing, getting up and down, rolling consistently-get the barn owner. This is most likely a colic and can be deadly if left untreated. Until they come try to get the horse standing and moving. It'll take a bit of time to learn to identify a sick horse, but once you learn their routines you should be good.   Stuff like haying and watering will probably be covered by any training, but in general a few fork fulls of a round bale or two flakes of a square bale constitute a meal.   Keep things organized. Nothing worse than tripping over a rake someone forgot to hang up, or trying to find the scissors while in the middle of haying.   Honestly, most things will come with time. I know Reddit has this image of crazy horse people, and there are some, but try to have fun. Don't get involved in the barn drama, and listen to what your boss says. Horse people are some of the most hard-working and determined people I've met, and I'm having the time of my life working with them.   Good luck!"

Your safety is number one, and don't ever be too prideful to bounce out of a sketchy situation, then learn from the sketchy situation so you're better equipped the next time it happens.  2, ask questions. Always ask questions. Caring for horses and riding horses is a life long learning experience. Don't ever think you know enough. Always be looking to learn more, and learn from a someone who knows what they are doing.  Everything I want to say won't make sense without the application. It all requires hands on learning.  Have fun!"
Horses,3cq1zo,queenmamabee,3,Fri Jul 10 03:40:52 2015 UTC,"Staying calm, especially turning emergencies (if you ever experience one) is pretty important. If anything ever happens between a person and a horse, make sure the person is ok before going to get the loose the horse. Don't turn your back to a horse. From a professional point of view, do not treat the horses as pets. If the owner wants to treat them as their pet vs a performance athlete then that is the owner's prerogative. The owner is allowed to say whatever they want about their horse and the caretakers role is to not have any favorites or anything unfavorable to say about any of the horses. For example, say Horse A owned by X was a lunatic on his way to turn out and X asks ""How is my horse today?"" You're thinking well he dragged me to the paddock, bolted through the gate and I barely got the lead shank off without loosing a hand but the professional response would be ""Your horse was very excited about turn out today."" If you see something say something but a wise horseperson also knows when to keep their mouth shut. Learn to think like a horse so you can learn to anticipate their reactions down the road. Learn what is ""normal"" for each horse and the basics of equine body language. If a horse that is usually calm in its stall is bearing its teeth and acting aggressive one day then I would watch the horse to see if it exhibits any other signs that signal illness. Be very gentle when working around a horse's face. If the horses are shod (wear shoes) and you frequently walk on a concrete aisle get into the habit of listening to the sound as they walk. Many times I've realized that a horse has thrown a shoe by listening rather than looking. Getting in the habit of doing a quick scan on the horse before and after turn out will make you a great employee. You'll learn which bumps are old injuries and when something is new and needs treatment. Telling the horses apart by their white markings makes it easy to differentiate horses of the same color. You're going to make mistakes. Learn from them and make a different mistake instead of repeating the same mistakes and you'll be fine. Being able to have a good attitude with your boss and the ability to build rapport with customers will make you successful. Horse care is a serious grind any many folks get easily burned out. Stay positive!"

Be firm, try not to be too tentative and scared as this is when they may take advantage. Use big body language if you want to be bossy, small looking down if you want their trust."

The more he saw, the better he understood what I wanted. We didn't have much time before our walk/trot dressage suitability class though, so he really didn't have a chance ""leg"" or ""spur."" So we just kept to our voice commands since that's what we use downtown."
Horses,3chzp3,eessennet,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:57:01 2015 UTC,We have done this sort of and it seems like a good idea. We just can't take him into the arena with our other horse because he gets excited and jumps/bucks. If he's in a field he trots/canters alongside our other horse just fine because he must be near his buddy at all times. I might just take him near the arena when we're schooling our other horse and let him just watch though.
Horses,3chzp3,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:27:33 2015 UTC,Would it help him focus more on the cues more if he had blinders or fuzzies on the checkpieces of the bridle? I would think that the biggest change besides pulling vs carrying the weight would be that the pony can see what is going on behind him which might startle him. Have you tried carrying a dressage whip? If his usual cue to go forward comes from a whip then it might be easier to get him to associate leg-tap with whip-forward then leg-forward which has no meaning to him.
Horses,3chzp3,NeverendingStarchild,2,Fri Jul 10 17:38:15 2015 UTC,"Blinders might be a good idea but I've never seen him spooked by anything but it could help focus his attention forward. We do carry a dressage whip to reinforce the leg and voice cues. He just doesn't seem to get it. Unfortunately, we have no idea what his old cues were because he came from a rescue that bought him at a slaughter auction."
Horses,3cgmdt,equustotallus,7,Tue Jul 7 19:26:25 2015 UTC,"A new environment can definitely affect them, but they adjust. It's extremely common. After a month of this though with no improvement (and because tack, health, etc is good) I would put money on the rider(s) exacerbating the problem.  The quiet steady boy was full of himself and spooky and the rider starts muckling on, riding tense, and anticipating the poor behaviors.  Seen it a million times. At that point it becomes a vicious circle. He's nervous, then the rider gets nervous, now he can't relax because the rider is telling him things really are scary, now the rider really can't relax because he's still worked up, and so on.  That's what I would be looking for. You just ride him through it and ignore all the crap. Be long, soft, and following, and ride forward with him in front of your leg. Be confident. If you seem secure and sure in the space and what you're telling him to do he'll take a deep breath and start chilling out.  If he's only being used for beginners then  you/they may not have all those skill sets necessary. I would put an experienced rider on him on a regular basis until that relaxation happens for him, as they will be better able to get him moving forward instead of the stilted, behind the leg movement you're describing.  Tldr: if the rider relaxes, he will relax"
Horses,3cgmdt,AtomicPenny,3,Tue Jul 7 20:44:23 2015 UTC,"As the others are saying, keep trying and working. I moved my horse to a new barn and I couldnt get her to do anything. It took a while to even get her down to the arena. I had to walk her down more than once but eventually I got her to hack out alone. I found that working on ground manners and trust building excercises went a long way."
Horses,3cgmdt,randomguy1411,2,Wed Jul 8 16:53:55 2015 UTC,"I moved barns a lot with my horse and he was always the nervous type. What I'd do is lunge him first, making sure that he went into the corners he normally spooked at because I felt safer working him through that on the ground. We'd spend a lot of time working on ground manners in the ring, and doing things like asking for his head to drop, turning left and right with a light tap of the whip (I actually trained him to drop his head with just the command ""head"" accidentally). Then I'd ride. I'd keep him really busy. Circles, transitions, trot and walk poles until he relaxed, then I'd praise and let him just walk or trot normally."
Horses,3cgmdt,hoofbeats,2,Wed Jul 8 18:25:01 2015 UTC,"I think its pretty common for a horse to react to a sudden change in his environment. For example, most horses exhibit more animation at a competition then they do at home. Its more challenging to ride in the open then in an arena because there is no fence/railing/wall to stop the horse. Embrace the challenge the horse is giving you as an opportunity to ride more effectively! Stay safe obviously and listen to your gut, especially if you think a situation could be dangerous. Work on getting a good, consistent, confident trot in the field for a few weeks and once comfortable with that then ask for the canter for a small period of time then back to walk. Take a walk break, canter for 30 secs then walk again. Over time you will be able to canter longer in between the walk breaks. Keep the horse mentally focused by asking for changes of direction frequently and making turns / circles frequently. Keeping the horse's world small and focused will help his nerves. I would also make sure that the grass is trimmed low in case the horse does not like the tickling feeling on his legs and so that you can inspect the ground for any holes and rocks prior to each ride."
Horses,3cgmdt,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:44:34 2015 UTC,"a little lazy for a TB, but like i said, very willing and very quiet   Sounds like my TB! I actually just moved to a new barn last Tuesday and my horse has been very anxious. Yesterday he was a saint. What I've been doing before every ride is lunging him until he gets pretty tired and seems relaxed. Also, if there are certain areas he's spooky at, why not hand walk him around the new barn/facility so he can scope things out? I moved from a 2 acre facility to a 10 acre facility and there's a lot my horse hasn't seen yet but on my off day from riding my trainer says I should hand walk him around the entire facility. In addition, try and make sure he gets out of his stall every day for the first few weeks."

Horses,3cchw5,Pablois4,2,Tue Jul 7 11:31:05 2015 UTC,Their manes are braided that way to show off their necks. The ribbons or rolls as they are called is for decoration. The tail is done the same way to show off the muscles in their butts.
Horses,3cchw5,TharBeSquirrels,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:53:58 2015 UTC,"For the mane that's mostly just decoration. Often they use the national colors, the local colors, or some kind of color combination for the event (e.g. a hunting festival in some places would require red, or green and white), or to represent the team/stable they are from so spectators can tell the teams apart."

Of course, your mileage may vary because every horse is an individual, but I have ridden and ridden with Foxtrotters on the regular and they're some great trail horses.   Are you familiar with gaited horse? If not, it wouldn't hurt to enlist the help of a professional who is or a friend who is. Gaited horses are wonderful horses and I, personally, prefer them to walk/trot horses (trotting hurts my back). But there's a lot to learn about them so having a professional to help is always a plus.  I suggest googling your little heart out about Foxtrotters and gaited horses in general (if you're not already familiar).

Next time insist that the vet comes as soon as he is lame. No drugs, poultices or anything- how he moves may give him a clue as to what's going on."
Horses,3c80gy,carbonarbonoxide,2,Sun Jul 5 21:04:55 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% with make the vet come out before treating him.

Horses,3c80gy,hoofbeats,3,Sun Jul 5 22:34:09 2015 UTC,"Navicular, abscess, osteoarthritis, all of these may come and go as they please and can be masked with bute successfully.   I'd xray."

I've seen a horse with absolutely no outward signs of an abscess act like she broke her leg. She was fine and then it broke out the side of her hoof. Also realize that what looks like lameness in a leg can also be due to pulled/tight muscles elsewhere. Loin and back issues especially will eventually transfer down the leg when they have to compensate."

Horses,3c80gy,dunmorestriden,4,Mon Jul 6 03:47:00 2015 UTC,"If you're sure it's a foot problem, have a farrier come and check out your horse. Sometimes calling the vet means spending tons of money on x-rays and tests when all that's wrong is a shoeing/trim issue. And if a farrier can't fix it, then definitely call the vet!"
Horses,3c80gy,poetoflove,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:34:02 2015 UTC,"Sounds like abscesses. You can try palpating around the coronet band and just above the bulbs of the heels to look for tenderness which could indicate a bigger issue (navicular) but with the pulse not being elevated it is less likely. If it were me I'd have a hoof care professional out to confirm abscesses (or to tell you that's not it and to get a vet). Then you at lease know what's going on if it happens in the future. Shoes will likely not help, as they will decrease circulation in the hoof and promote structural weakness throughout the internal structure of the hoof."
Horses,3c80gy,-00-00,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:44:09 2015 UTC,"What is the footing in the area where he is turned out like? The first instance seems like the classic case of an abscess. When a horse is gets an abscess, they can look three legged until it blows. The abscess will blow out depending on where the trauma occurred. They can sometimes be a reaction - literally like a bruise that turned into a cyst.  Stone bruising is the next thing that comes to mind. I've had a horse go out sound in the morning, get tacked up to ride, come out head bopping lame, get the black tar style hood packing, stay in, and jog sound the next day. Lameness can be freaky. If you ever think the horse might be in pain, listen to your instinct and do not ride. I generally do not think that horses fake lameness. I have experience with situations where an arthritic horse needs additional time and a specific warm-up but this is not the horse being a whimp. Horses get loose and it is frustrating! Most horses that go into long-term rehabilitation will have some medicinal help after the stall help to keep spirits at bay and prevent reinjury from happening. Some can be administered orally. Using a lead shank is also helpful for horses that go too quickly through their groundwork/leading. Hand walking in an arena can help control external factors that could contribute to a horse's misbehavior.   So long as the horse's pain is able to managed properly before he vet (ie Bute, Banamine, etc.), I do not think that it is unreasonable to wait 2-3 days before calling. That being said, I am not familiar with the AAEP scale. If a horse is on three legs. I am calling the vet probably at 2 AM. If he bobs his head a couple of times, there is no reason to pay for an emergency vet visit. I would probably standing wrap /hoof pack/hand walk 15 mins 3x/day and use epsom soak after/if an abscess breaks.   EDIT: The effects of bute will likely metabolize in 12 hours and I would show the horse to the vet without any NSAID or pain reliever in his system."

Horses,3c3yd8,AtomicPenny,3,Sat Jul 4 16:32:15 2015 UTC,"When I see products like this I always imagine terrible info-mercials.  Tired of using those ziploc bags for your supplements?! -insert someone struggling to open one, ripping it by pulling too hard and spraying the contents in their face-.  Well now you too can be baggie free!!  Same with that pill dispenser treat.  I just see someone flailing pills all over, falling down because the horse moves suddenly or trying to put paste in the horse's mouth and getting it all over and in their eyes.  If you are at the stage where you have horses and have been giving them wormer and supplements and medicine...you've probably figured out your own system.  These are not very innovative and just because you can hang it on a wall by the string doesn't keep it safe from rodents.  They climb walls o_O"
Horses,3c3yd8,Allyz0r,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:14:52 2015 UTC,Yes! I've also seen people use the littlest ziplock/Tupperware containers meant for salad dressing or snack portions for them too. Very rodent-proof!!
Horses,3c3yd8,carbonarbonoxide,2,Sun Jul 5 13:04:57 2015 UTC,I would honestly never ever use this. It's really not that hard to store or move grain and supplements for free without paying for a weird bag I would have to wash. Buckets work better and smartpak has made supplement packing or storing ridiculously easy.
Horses,3c2h0w,Redefine_Sass,2,Sat Jul 4 03:38:51 2015 UTC,"I own a horse who is, by textbook definition, a lot of horse to handle. She's a 10 year TWH mare who's had something like 5 or 6 owners in her short lifetime. This is because she's a lot to handle, has a ton of attitude, is spooky, and is very stereotypical of a mare - has horrible heat cycles, very mareish, etc.   I've had my fair share of very bad days with her where I've sit and cried and thought I'll never get what I want from this mare and that I'm wasting my time. Then, she'll do something awesome like walk up to me when I'm upset, cross an obstacle we've never come across before, or just show me how great of a horse she really is buried deep underneath her anxiety and angst and I realize that giving up on her would be the worst decision I could make.   Working with a 1200lbs animal is tough - they're strong, determined, and above all, prey animals who move faster then they think. We're the predators and we don't always understand their actions but I think most horses, deep down, just want to bond and please their people, even if they can't express it or show it.   My mare has gone from being a horse that nobody could handle, to biting at you, disrespecting you, stepping on you, throwing her head up when putting a bit in her mouth, dancing around to saddle and mount, taking off on you when you're riding, no gait in her anywhere, pinning her ears and running from you in the pasture, refusing to trailer load, refusing even the simplest of obstacles, not road safe, not car safe, not tractor, four wheeler, etc safe to being an excellent trail horse who I can bring anywhere and do anything with. Of course, my mare is who is she, and some days we revert back to those behaviors, and it's frustrating and embarrassing, but I just remember the days where she's impressed me beyond belief and then I know she's worth it, even if I have to fight to get to the horse she can be.   Good luck with your mare, and if you aren't already, enlist the help of a trusted experienced friend or professional, it can really make a huge difference."
Horses,3c2h0w,bearxfoo,2,Mon Jul 6 11:31:02 2015 UTC,"So at my lesson barn, it's pretty typical to ride out the barn and down the long dirt driveway after a lesson in the indoor. It's a nice way to cool down.  About a year ago I started working with a late teens 15 hh Oldenburg mare that my trainer described as ""challenging"" and ""a good next step"" for me.  After my first lesson on her, I asked my trainer if it would be ok to walk her down the driveway. Trainer says ""ok...she might be a little tricky"". We walk out the barn and the mare has an instant panic moment - head up, eyes rollin' a bit, nostrils flaring, dancing in place, feels like she's thinking about rearing. One of my top five ""oh shit that could have really ended badly"" horse moments. Me and my trainer talk to her, get her calmed down and move maybe 4-5 steps down the driveway, turn around once she's calm. Later get to talking with the owner who said she'd given up on getting her working outside, the mare freaks out too much. I thought, well, this horse goes out for turnout in a big field away from the barn, she's probably not totally barn sour, I bet with some patience she could probably get over herself.  For the past year I've been taking lessons on her every week and about 6 months ago I started a half-lease on her and started riding 2 times a week on top of that - after every ride, if the weather was ok, I'd walk her down the driveway a bit with a handful of sugar or a carrot to give her when she was calm. Once she got a handle on that I'd ride her out a few steps, a little bit farther every week. I finally got her to walk all the way down the driveway today without too much upset, just had to boot her along past some tasty grass :-) We'll get to the trails eventually, I hope."
Horses,3c2h0w,energyequalscake,2,Tue Jul 7 01:39:21 2015 UTC,"I bought a lovely Arab stallion sight unseen a few years ago. I had spoken to people who knew him, previous trainers etc and not heard a bad word. I'm very experienced with naughty horses, Arabs & stallions but when this horse arrived, I think I cried for a week.   Although he was/is beautiful, he was nasty. He pinned me in the corner of his stable, struck me and broke two ribs and my collar bone.  He would lunge at me in the round yard. He can easily open gates and stable doors. All 14hh of him can jump 6ft fences from a standstill. I was at a complete loss of what to do with him, as you can tell from my username I live in the outback - Australia, where another horse person that had more experience than me that was close enough to help was impossible to find.   Day in, day out we worked together, I learnt how harsh and heavy handed sometimes you have to be, my partner was always within eyesight incase something went wrong. It took a 6 months of constant, consistent handling to even consider putting him in a paddock, 6 months later I was able to easily ride him, 2 1/2 years after buying him, I've gelded him, have competed heavily on him, he became my most reliable, trustworthy pony. I recently sold him to a 9 year old girl who he takes through pony club and looks after with his life.   He was a one in a million pony, who was very spoilt, and very naughty but will never be able to be replaced."
Horses,3c2h0w,OutbackSheila,3,Sun Jul 12 08:59:29 2015 UTC,"Hi!!  When I was 13, I was working full-time to pay for my pony. She was an awesome little mare but I was growing and all the other stablehands had real horses that were winning real shows.  A local racing stable was being shut down and dispersed over an animal cruelty direction so with my whole $500 in savings, I went over to have a look.  In the back paddock there was this hella ugly mare with her leg half hanging off from a fence wound. All skinny and missing fur and no mane or tail. Price tag? $2500.  Well, I worked a little harder and earned a little more and bought this walking money pit.  Her leg was pretty well destroyed but many vet bills later she started to look physically better.  She wasn't getting mentally better though.  We're talking rearing, spinning, spooking, you name it.  Long story short, I spent two years studying natural horsemanship while the real girls competed their real horses.  By the time I was seventeen me and my mare were cleaning up at a 1* eventing level.   At 19 we ran our first 2*.  By the end of it, I could ride this horse literally anywhere. She succeeded in everything. Not once did she say 'no.'  I ended up passing her onto a young boy, maybe, 11? They needed something safe for him to ride on the station around stock. Her old leg injury was holding her back and she needed to stop competing hard.  She was my hero, and boy did she teach me some lessons! I miss her every day but they love her so much. Now I have her younger sister. Same story again hahaha.   Except this time around I've had a couple of nasty falls so I'm quite nervous, but I have hope!"

Horses,3c2hvm,Crohnsmonkey,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:16:55 2015 UTC,Rubbermaid containers or trash cans are what I use.  Rodents will eat through the feed bags so clipping them shut is not usually sufficient unless you have a bunch of talented barn cats.

Horses,3c2hvm,hoofbeats,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:38:23 2015 UTC,"Good question. I would just store in a big trash bin with a secure lid in your garage. The most important thing is to keep rodents and bird feces out of the grain (and hay) because improperly stored feed can put your horse at risk for EPM: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Equine_Protozoal_Myeloencephalitis_life_cycle.jpg  You'll also want to control the moisture content to prevent mold so if you have more grain then what will fit into the trash bins at one time then I would store the bags of grain on a pallet or off of the ground. To be extra safe, I would set some rodent traps around the grain. EPM is often career ending for most horses."

Horses,3bsej6,NeverendingStarchild,7,Wed Jul 1 19:38:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think voicing your concerns is rude. You have a legitimate question on the practice and a concern for the horses well being, and having a conversation about that doesn't mean you're a huge bitch or that the owner/trainer is an incompetent jerk. It's simply a discussion.  I also think, based on your description, that your trainer's morals or experience leaves something to be desired if the second horse's pastern is visibly swollen and he offers immediate pain signs when it is so much as touched, and she blows it off.  Along the clubbing lines, my gelding's left fore is clubbed. Obviously each case is different but I'll give my experience with it. My farrier did an amazing job mitigating a lot of it when he was little (I've had him since he was born), but it still is what it is, and you notice when you look at him that it's not like the others. I have never had it X-rayed, he has never had a lame day in his life, nor has he ever had any pain with that foot/leg. But I also don't  fight it now that he's grown and we did what we could initially, his angle is not perfect, and we just work with what's there rather than trying to shoot for an ideal. His heel is a little longer on that foot and his toe a little shorter. The big concern with that hoof is breakover so he moves evenly. A shorter more rounded toe allows him to break at the same point in his striding that he does with the normal legs, when he's long it starts getting a bit off and his action in that leg becomes more severe as he starts having to ""pull"" his leg off the ground. It's not lameness, it's barely noticeable, but when you ride you can feel it or if he's really strutting and moving out in the pasture you can see that teensy bit of extra action. It could definitely develop into sore pasterns, knees, shoulders if left unchecked, and then ultimately into a whole lot of extra wear and tear."
Horses,3bsej6,AtomicPenny,4,Wed Jul 1 21:06:46 2015 UTC,"I'm a farrier. You are right to be careful about voicing opinions. I'm not suggesting you bury your head and look the other way, but be careful. For instance,  wedge pads do not cause coffin bone rotation. heels will crush, the digital cushion can displace and if done without impression material and frog support it can lead to a prolapsed frog. On the other hand,  a negative palmer angle will cause more damage, so we wedge to deal with the bigger issue. Wedges are also great for arthritis,  giving the hoof some lift reduces the amount of flexion needed to move, particularly with bad knees.  Lots of guys get club feet wrong,  and I really don't know why. Other than being poorly educated.  Clubs can reach a grade in which heel cannot be taken off. Or I should say it can be removed however the horse will not be able to put their heel on the ground, and it has to be wedged to relieve the tendons. Cutting toes back is a common way of adjusting breakover. Long toes are terrible for a horses long term soundness.  The guy may be doing well or he may be an idiot, I have no idea. But I can say that from the professionals perspective, mine at least, reading a few things online doesn't give you enough perspective make value judgements on horses that are not yours. Use it as a springboard for asking questions and find out what the guy under the horse is thinking. Then say something if you like."
Horses,3bsej6,horses_fart_on_me,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:29:14 2015 UTC,"Heels will crush, the digital cushion can displace and if done without impression material and frog support it can lead to a prolapsed frog. What would this look like in early stages?   Wedges are also great for arthritis, giving the hoof some lift reduces the amount of flexion needed to move, particularly with bad knees. This is very applicable to Horse 1 and perhaps the reason for the wedges. I was under the impression that wedges were generally used just for situations where a horse has a low heel or is developing navicular so this certainly brings some clarity. What signs would you look for to determine when the cons of the wedges (crushed heels, etc.) would outweigh the pros (relief for arthritis/knees)? Horse 1 has wedges and Horse 2 is the horse I think has a clubfoot. Horse 2 does not have pads.   I agree that I'm really not qualified to determine whether the guy is doing well or not. Being a farrier is tough work and something that I know I would have difficulty doing. I'm terrified of trimming my dogs nails and never get it right on my own feet either. Hoof care is something that I am really interested in learning more about and I am curious about what is going on in situations I have not seen before. I would feel really bad if I had a ""hunch"" about something, never said anything, kept riding the horse and then experienced a problem down the road."
Horses,3bsej6,horses_fart_on_me,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:15:38 2015 UTC,"Great question. When heels crush they move forward and contract. The bars are pushed forward and flatten. The frog narrows and the heel angle changes, rather than growing tall it grows forward. The same amount of measurable hoof growth, but at a useless angle. That  cannot be corrected,  in most every case. From the top you will see the heels bulging,  from the bars moving forward and outward and the digital cushion displacing. The hairline will jam between the quarters and the heel. Most changes occur on the underside, obscured by the pad. The pro vs con would be whether the horse can walk without them. I really don't care for wedge pads, unless it is for a severely arthritic or broken back hoof. Adding the wedge from the ground rather than a pad does more to correct leverage such as we would for a navicular horse or one with tendon tears or sheath injuries. Long story short if a horse goes sound without wedging then don't do it, if they don't then nail em on. Walking sound is always the goal. If what you see isn't right then by all means as customers and animal owners speak up. There are alot of guys out there that have no business climbing under horses."
Horses,3bsej6,silver_slinky,3,Wed Jul 8 01:24:22 2015 UTC,"The fact that you're concerned about sounding rude when voicing your opinion says to me that you're probably not known around the barn for being unpleasant, rude, or frequently sticking your nose where it doesn't belong.   That said I think you can fairly easily voice your opinion without it coming off the wrong way. You probably ought to restrict what you say to the horse that you you are half leasing. Just phrase it as a question so it doesn't come off too demanding: ""hey It was my understanding that xxxxxx because ""cite reasons"" but we're doing yyyyy with lease horse. Is there a reason for yyyyy?"""
Horses,3bsej6,AtomicPenny,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:35:14 2015 UTC,"I think I can innocently ask about the lease horse out of curiosity about if the pads are for early stage navicular or for another reason and then explain how wedges are not something I have seen before (which is true).  I can also ask if prolonged time in wedge pads will eventually change the angle of the coffin/navicular/pastern bones (like I have read it will) and hopefully foster a constructive conversation.

Horses,3bsej6,hoofbeats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:14:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for understanding. I mentioned something about the toe being cut back...literally a triangle of the hoof wall about an inch high was removed...and asked what had happened. She said that it was something the farrier wanted to do and left it at that. I explained how I wasn't comfortable riding the horse with the hoof like that because if anything happened I would feel responsible. She was understanding. Unfortunately the heel on the one foot is now about an inch off of the ground while more of the toe has been removed which is a red flag for me. I should probably post pics.  By no means do I think that any abuse/neglect is happening. I think that neither direct care providers have experienced treating the condition before.
Horses,3bsej6,feralhund,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:02:37 2015 UTC,"literally a triangle of the hoof wall about an inch high was removed   White line disease maybe? I do think you have a good frame of mind about it. Too many owners just follow directions and don't ask enough questions.    I do think in the case of low heels, you have to pull the toe back (because the heel grows forward not down). However, if the horse is also in wedge pads I would think that's counter productive."
Horses,3bsej6,ellevt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:44:48 2015 UTC,"I did not think about white line disease for Horse 1, but that makes more sense - especially because when I asked about filling it the owner said that the farrier wanted to leave it open. I guess I was originally thinking clubbed foot because the one hoof looks so different (especially in heel/angle) from the other.  The rounded/rasped back toe is much more severe in the hind than in the front so it also makes sense that if the horse has low heels in the back then that is why. The wedges are in the front and when I started working the horse he had almost no heel - just a shriveled, cracked area where I am used to seeing bulbs. With regular work and some topical treatments, I am pleased with how the heels look now.   Its tough because I am in the opposite climate from where I did most of my learning. Coming from the Midwest, the most common problem I would see were hooves that were too soft - especially in horses that lived outside 24/7 where mud/snow kept the horses basically standing in ""water"" 24/7. Rarely would cracks happen and the worse damage would happen when a horse threw a shoe. Now I am in the Southwest where dryness is the culprit and I am seeing things that I don't have much experience with.   Really good ideas! Thanks!"

Horses,3bosk4,Ephemeral_Halcyon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:35:19 2015 UTC,It was tough. We just had to coat him with creams and hope for the best! But yeah you're very fortunate that nothing more was damaged !

Horses,3bosk4,jennygirl,3,Wed Jul 1 03:12:42 2015 UTC,Tell me about it. My girl's #1 pasttime is hurting herself in some fashion.  Rubbed ointment over 7 different wounds this afternoon. There are at least 3-4 more healed over enough that they don't need any more care.   Ridiculous.

Horses,3bosk4,TheEthalea,3,Wed Jul 1 04:33:33 2015 UTC,I knew about raw honey but I had never bought of using turmeric for inflammation- thanks for the tip! Can I ask quantities and types for the turmeric you fed her (ie. Raw or powder? How much?) nice job!
Horses,3bosk4,RagnodOfDoooom,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:46:13 2015 UTC,"for both internal and external I bought powder, organic, the highest quality I could find. you want the really dark almost orangy colour, not the pale yellow stuff.   I mixed the turmeric into her grain, about 1/8 cup per day. I split it between two feedings because it is a large amount and she HATES the taste. some horses will lick it up and love it, others just can't stand the stuff. I had a mini who foundered and he was on apple cider vinegar, cayenne pepper, and turmeric daily and the sassy little thing loved his spicy dinner so it really is a personal thing as it is with human tastebuds. if your horse won't eat it I recommend mixing with warm water and syringing it down their throat. wear old clothes. lol"
Horses,3bosk4,RagnodOfDoooom,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:40:30 2015 UTC,"I was feeding a very high quantity by the way, you can totally start at a tablespoon and work your way up as you see fit. you can't really go overboard on it, they will simply refuse it if it is too strong"
Horses,3bosk4,leahlemon,2,Wed Jul 1 14:41:46 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad she had a caring and dedicated owner! Looking at the wound and how it healed I would have never guessed it was that bad. Good job, OP!!"
Horses,3bosk4,SuperRicktastic,2,Wed Jul 1 03:11:29 2015 UTC,My moms TB bratty mare did the same thing. She was pissed she wasn't allowed out in her attached turnout so she kicked and kicked her door all night long and somehow loosened the slide latch but not completely. She got caught in the corner of the door and it closed on her leg. Thousands in surgery to immediately close it. I actually was there as a kid holding the light for the vet. Closed it up similarly by cleaning and treating it daily. I think Corona cream that thick yellow cream became our best friend.
Horses,3bosk4,SuperRicktastic,2,Wed Jul 1 03:51:24 2015 UTC,TB=TurdBrain... gotta love them though
Horses,3bosk4,mommisalami,2,Wed Jul 1 04:31:16 2015 UTC,"Looks great! Nice job caring for it. I had a mare who skinned her hind leg down to the bone (you could see bone and her tendon moving around!) and it took three frustrating years to heal. Hers was closer to the inside of her hock joint, so really really tough to bandage abd keep supple. Lots of battles with proud flesh. Yours looks amazing!"
Horses,3bosk4,rivensky,2,Wed Jul 1 04:11:32 2015 UTC,that sounds horrific!! I am so so lucky that this wound was superficial.
Horses,3bovn5,Bittz,3,Tue Jun 30 23:12:18 2015 UTC,Does that horse seriously have both a martingale and a running rein? :(
Horses,3bovn5,I_like_your_unit,3,Wed Jul 1 08:29:04 2015 UTC,"I really hope /u/Bittz chimes in. She posts a lot of pictures and the occasional ones come through with equipment like this, never before seen bits, etc.  Curiosity killed the cat and all that I suppose, but I'm just always dying to know the why behind those sorts of decisions."
Horses,3bovn5,AtomicPenny,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:36:45 2015 UTC,What are those and why is it bad?
Horses,3bovn5,TheEthalea,3,Wed Jul 1 10:41:40 2015 UTC,"Martingale is not bad per se, as long as it is loose enough, it just makes sure that you can still use your reins when the horse decides to throw his head in the air :) (the rings on the rein go to the girth)  A running rein is a rein from the girth through the front legs and the bit, and extra rein in addition to the one connected to the bit. It keeps the horse from raising his head (depending on how tight you hold it). I personally don't like seeing that one on horses, as it is very easily misused by tightening it too much and essentially forcing your horses' head down. It's also completely unneccesary to have both martingale and running rein."
Horses,3bovn5,I_like_your_unit,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:57:29 2015 UTC,"He indeed does have both pieces of equipment. They help keep him round; sometimes I use a running and a spur or this set up. Depends on the day. This was actually our first ride for him at this stable & chose this under the advice of a former Olympian. He usually just needs a little correction every now and then in order to remind him to carry himself & is ridden on the buckle most of the time while being trained in the ring. I took him out for a hack instead of ring work and used this. He's an eventer and has some spice to him, but is also super sweet."
Horses,3bmc8y,bearxfoo,7,Tue Jun 30 11:20:36 2015 UTC,"Fun! How was it?  I haven't done the overnights with the horses before, but it's always been on my list. My guys acted like they were going to be murdered any moment when I tried do nighttime turnout in the summer, so I don't know how they'd take to being in the big bad woods at night with all the boogeymen lol"
Horses,3bmc8y,AtomicPenny,10,Tue Jun 30 13:22:51 2015 UTC,"It was awesome, but camping with horses is A LOT of work. I've never put my mare on picket line before so I had no clue how she'd act but she was totally fine. The only issue is that she came into season while there and kept putting her ass in another horses face that she shared the line with (a gelding, of course). So there was some fighting on the picket line but after being kicked a few times she stopped.   My mare is pastured 24/7 so nighttime is no biggie for her. We rode the hairs off of our horses so honestly they slept most of the time, they were TIRED.   it's awesome, you should do it at least once!"
Horses,3bmc8y,randomguy1411,5,Tue Jun 30 13:45:23 2015 UTC,I have some leave coming up and I plan on taking my horse camping. Care to share any tips for a first timer?
Horses,3bmc8y,Barren23,5,Tue Jun 30 14:47:06 2015 UTC,"I think the best advice is to be prepared for anything, and, try to camp (for your first couple times) with somebody else who is experienced.   I haven't camped in years and never with this mare. She wouldn't drink the water from camp, and luckily the people we were with had alfalfa pellets that you can hydrate with water and make kind of a slop. I didn't even consider she may not drink the water so this really saved our butts as it finally got her to drink some water, plus some extra.    Also, look into what kind of camping you're doing (rustic, sleeping in a LQ trailer, motor home, etc). Does the camp site have picket lines or stalls? If you're picketing for the first time, try to match your horse with another horse they'll be comfortable with and try to minimize fighting. Also, decide if you're going to use a lead rope and their halter, a lead rope and collar or something else completely (the people we camped with picketed their horses with a collar and a bungie rope, kind of like what people have in their crossties, with a quick release snap on it, so if they get tangled up, and pull enough, it'll let the go). I'm a nervous wreck with picket lines so I prefer places with stalls, but many don't have them. Some people bring portable electric fencing but that is also kind of hit and miss.   There's a lot of ways to do things, and it takes time to figure it all out, and you'll probably make a ton of mistakes before it seems easy. Also, common sense but make sure you have enough hay, grain, etc for your horse (we generally feed about half a bale a day).   Good luck! It's hard work but worth it."
Horses,3bmc8y,mrflossin,4,Tue Jun 30 15:21:26 2015 UTC,"My wife and I are planning to do a short test trail ride off-site sometime late summer, with hopes of doing overnights next year.  There is a trail less than a half hour from the farm that is very flat and wide, so it should be a decent test.... if that goes well, we may move up to a day-ride option that is a state park with a fair amount of hills.  Once we've mastered that, we'll move to some overnight options. :)  I think we'll stick to places with stalls or paddocks though, I don't want to worry about a high line or picket line all night.  As others have asked, I'd love to hear about some basics for first timers."
Horses,3bmc8y,numberjack,3,Tue Jun 30 15:22:28 2015 UTC,"That's a good plan! I've been doing day rides for years and I honestly prefer it because camping is so much work with horses. It's not like ""let's pull in, park, put up our tent and we'e done!"" It's constant work. Does the horse need hay? water? is it time to grain? and the worst is if they're left alone on the picket line. I had to skip a few meals because my camping buddy would take her gelding off the picket line to lunge him or mess with him and my mare lost it, she panicked thinking she was getting left alone.   Start off slow and don't overdo it. :) You'll get there though! I replied above with some tips, but if you have specific questions feel free to PM me!"
Horses,3bpx33,egghorsego,3,Wed Jul 1 05:04:19 2015 UTC,"No. It's not. Honestly, as long as you have the owners permission, nobody really cares what you do with your horse/your lease/whatever. You're leasing the horse with the owners permission, where you board them at is your business and your decision only (well, the owners decision too). Boarding barns don't care as long as you're paying your board, and taking care of the horse you bring onto their property. As long as there's legal contracts signed appropriately."
Horses,3bpx33,bearxfoo,2,Wed Jul 1 13:20:36 2015 UTC,"I free leased a horse for nearly two years with the understanding that I would never be able to buy her due to my college plans. I think as long as you clarify your plan with the person you lease from, it'll be totally fine and not at all frowned upon."
Horses,3bpx33,glyndwr67,2,Wed Jul 1 19:10:01 2015 UTC,"Under the lease agreement you are responsible for the horses care I assume. As long as you are doing that, no one should care where you board."
Horses,3bpx33,feralhund,0,Thu Jul 2 05:21:11 2015 UTC,"Often a free lease comes with the caveat that the owner does have a say over where the horse lives and who the vet/farrier are. These are usually informal arrangements because no money is changing hands, and typically both parties need each other.   Though you're right- if the other barn is also better quality the owner might even like the idea."
Horses,3bpx33,carbonarbonoxide,2,Thu Jul 2 08:11:22 2015 UTC,"One issue with ""barn jumping"" is that it is more difficult for barn managers to keep a closed environment/control potential health conditions when there are many horses coming in/out or when there are boarders/riders who travel between barns. So long as all the facilities maintain a diligent vaccination program then I would not worry. Some facilities require boarders to take lessons and others don't so I would also check with the place you are thinking of boarding at to make sure that training is not a requirement for boarding. So long as the owner is cool with everything and the lease conditions/contract reflects the agreement accordingly then you should be fine."
Horses,3bpx33,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:46:02 2015 UTC,"I have a sorta free lease, I buy my horses food and I literally can do anything I want with him. Mess with his feed, shoe him, cut his mane and tail, board him somewhere else and his owner will even trailer him where ever I want. So I don't think that its weird to board him somewhere else as long as you have permission."

I have a variety of beasts ranging from blindly eats anything you offer in an open hand to wont even eat 2 grams of bute mixed well into 5 quarts of grain.

When the wound was at the point where the moisture in the honey was no longer assisting the healing process, I began to dust the cleaned wound with straight turmeric. this also created a corn-starch like barrier between the bandages and the wound.. this was an amazing discovery because nothing stuck and pulled off the fragile fresh skin! You would think it would sting, being a spice and all, but she barely reacted to it so it must not be too bad. On myself I'll make a turmeric and milk paste for wounds that does not sting!"

I did call out a vet, who did a really crappy job at throwing 5 stitches up the inside of the cannon bone and saying that there was no point in doing any more as the flap of skin was going to die and fall off and the leg would be lumpy forever. I didn't listen.   my treatment protocol consisted of these things;  -daily (twice daily for the first week) cleansing with sea salt and warm water.   -applying raw honey and turmeric topically, honey for control of infection as well as prevention of proud flesh and excess scar tissue and turmeric for inflammation, promoting circulation, stimulating hair and skin regrowth.  -she was also fed turmeric internally as an inflammation reducer   -on top of all that, properly, snugly done bandages to keep her leg together in the shape we wanted it. it was a hell of a lot of washing and wrapping."
Horses,3blu8y,swearsies,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:06:48 2015 UTC,"I'd have called out a second vet, that first one sounds useless!  I've heard of honey before but never tumeric (internally or externally) for wounds and inflammation. Interesting!  What was your turnout regimen towards the beginning? Did she leave bandages alone enough to be out or did you have to keep her in more? I'm an outside when possible sort of person, I would imagine moving around would help keep blood flow high and speed up the healing.  What was the timeline between photos? What was the timeline between the injury and progress milestones?"

Horses,3bef9f,showmebevelle,2,Sun Jun 28 13:30:27 2015 UTC,I know nothing about eventing but would love to piddle around and maybe do some novice/ training level stuff. Really I want to do one competition just to try it out. What would you recommend someone do to get started? I suppose find a trainer that does haul-in lessons and doesn't mind a casual student.
Horses,3bef9f,carbonarbonoxide,3,Sun Jun 28 13:36:46 2015 UTC,Definitely grab a trainer - it's a complicated thing to get into with all the rules and phases if you've never done it before.  It's super fun though so definitely give it a go!!  And find a nice easy course to start out on :)
Horses,3bef9f,carbonarbonoxide,2,Sun Jun 28 13:49:26 2015 UTC,Thanks. Congrats on your win too btw! How rude of me to not say that first.

Horses,3bef9f,daydreams356,2,Sun Jun 28 13:57:35 2015 UTC,"Grab a trainer and do a few schoolings, you've got areas pretty close to you that have awesome courses. If I was you I'd start Novice or BN and see how your mare handles it. I'm guessing she won't have any issues with the height or the dressage, she might be lookey cross-country though. Sometimes the horse I've competed that have only done primarily SJ in the past have to be trotted through most of the cross country until they're more comfortable"
Horses,3bef9f,Found_your_marbles,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:07:24 2015 UTC,"The best thing is to get a trainer who will take you out to an event. Eventing is a complicated sport in a lot of ways and its REALLY helpful to have someone walk courses with you. Intro level is pretty basic and will let you ease into it relatively easily though. There are also ""Horse Trial (HT) Schooling shows"" that are just dressage and show jumping that can give you a bit of a taste of the experience without the cross country part. The sport is VERY welcoming and a lot of fun.   Training level isn't really ""training level""... its actually quite difficult and challenging. At training level the cross country questions are getting more complicated and you can jump up to 3'11"" with brush jumps... 3'3"" with normal jumps. The width and scope of the cross country makes them very intimidating though. Start at beginner novice or intro and move up from there."
Horses,3bef9f,ze1da,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:37:03 2015 UTC,"In eventing you typically start off at beginner novice (or intro in some places) btw. I wouldn't aim to start off at training, training XC is a whole different world from novice:). I'd definitely suggest getting a trainer!"
Horses,3bef9f,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:07:48 2015 UTC,"I've seen several of your videos and posts, so I know you are a very good rider, I think most of the push to start low in eventing is because of the rush. I've had a horse who is consistently jumping 3'3 easy in the arena and schooling novice xc, but thought starter (2'3) xc was terrifying. There's something about the galloping, and the extreme rush the horse (and rider) gets out on course that turns their brain off for some horses. They don't look at any jump till they are 3 strides out, and if you can't get them organized for that jump 4 strides after a big drop on a sharp bending line, you have a fly by.   Mostly we recommend starting with beginner novice or novice because you don't know how your horse will respond to the adrenaline rush till you're out on your first course. So you want it to be about a foot lower than you are used to jumping, because injury is much more likely and common on xc than on a show jump course."
Horses,3bef9f,Found_your_marbles,3,Sun Jun 28 14:13:37 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I see. It just seems... I dunno- like I'm being too much of a wimp if I start with baby stuff on a fairly well trained horse. I always thought beginner novice was for juniors on ponies and beginner adults. I'd feel the same about jumping a 2'6""-3' classic at a local show and beating the kids on school horses because it's straight up not fair to bring a gun to a knife fight, but I suppose maybe there's not such a culture of ""what class is for whom"" in eventing?  (And I'll be honest some of it is a personal pride thing because of a past/ongoing issue I've had with a person in my area who, long story short, screwed a friend/trainer of mine who did her a lot of favors and now thinks she is Queen Tits because she schooled XC twice and now ""is an eventer."" I know- not a smart or mature reason to want to push my limits as a rider, but there you have it.)"
Horses,3bef9f,ze1da,2,Mon Jun 29 13:49:00 2015 UTC,try schooling shows! They're great for someone just getting in the sport and you could see how your horse would do on XC without the pressure of a real show.  That's just my suggestion:)
Horses,3bef9f,Found_your_marbles,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:04:42 2015 UTC,"lol, I understand, I looked at the eventing levels and was like, no way training level could be considered that hard! But put a maxed out table on an a steep uphill or downhill, and they are suddenly totally different beasts. I've never seen or heard of anyone starting a horse on eventing higher than novice the first time, even the super pros, so no one will call you a wimp for sure!  Anyways, any reason to try out eventing is a good reason! It is the most fun ever, horses usually love it, and the people are super awesome."
Horses,3bgt0y,HatPants,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:28:35 2015 UTC,"Have you contacted Fish and Game, tje conservation officers, animal control, and any other similar authorities you may have in the area?  I agree with /u/showmebevelle about the risks you are taking. I would NOT be attempting this search and rescue mission solo. A loose panicky horse is a huge liability and causes havoc under the best of circumstances (relative contained at home, at a show, etc). And somewhere in miscellaneous wilderness is hardly the best of circumstances. If something did happen and you were tossed, 2 escaped horses are exponentially harder to catch than 1. The stupid gets contagious!  Or what if the horse is injured? Two or more people could allow someone to stay with the horse (either caught or location monitored) while someone else rides off for a trailer, vet, etc. Or what if the horse is injured and has attracted predators?  I don't know what you have in the area, but even a desperate coyote could be a huge threat if you get off to go tend to a big cut and try to slip a halter on or something.  A lot could go wrong here. Or you could ride out, find the horse in 10 minutes, and have him be ""thank god I'm rescued! The real world is scary let's go home!!""  Just be careful!   Edit: I just read your other post and that this horse went missing all tacked up. I would definitely consider his risks of being injured to be higher and finding him quickly to be even more imperative.  What have the owner and barn owner done already to help the process?"

I think it can also depend  on whether you and your house are accustomed to the heat or not.  At my barn, we generally don't ride between 11 & 5 if we can help it.  When and if we do, they are short rides, and we don't push it too hard.  If we didn't ride when it was over 75/80 degrees, we'd never ride!!"

I don't like to go out if it's much over 75, and at that temperature I'll turn around if my horse starts sweating in places the tack doesn't touch him, especially if he hasn't been working hard.  I hate being hot, and I know I'd have a total meltdown if someone forced me to keep doing physical work in the heat with no relief, so if I think the horse is uncomfortable, that's the end of our ride.  But this is only my second summer riding, and my first in a place that gets over 80 or so, and there's no way to hose him down without turning his entire pen muddy (leased horse, someone else's property), so I might be overly cautious.  I'd love to hear opinions from someone more experienced."
Horses,3b9749,I_like_your_unit,2,Sat Jun 27 16:42:20 2015 UTC,"I think I would hose him down anyway, if it's hot enough his pen won't be muddy for long.

Horses,3b8sin,ThisGirlsGoneCountry,6,Fri Jun 26 22:08:56 2015 UTC,"When I first got my OTTB, we had her shoes pulled off because she was being put into a shared pasture and I didn't want extra harm done. For background, I live in Texas on a plot of land that's very hard, rocky, and dry. She lived her life in a cushy stall or on otherwise soft ground, with shoes on as well. When we pulled them off, she was not a happy camper. Her hooves were trimmed short along with having the shoes on, so with them off she was constantly sore. Constantly bitchy. She only had aluminum racing shoes on, but they made all the difference.  So, we had the farrier come and put a new set of shoes on her so that her hooves could grow. We kept them on until her hooves were overgrown, then pulled them off and trimmed her down again. He paid a lot of attention to keeping them long that time, and doing so gave her the time to get used to the ground on bare feet. After a couple of trims leaving her just a little long, he finally trimmed her down to the proper normal length that he does on my other horse and she did great.   While we did this, she also got a scoop of knox gelatin and a double serving of Dumor hoof supplement in her feed twice per day. I do believe that also went a long way in helping hoof growth and strength.  Haven't had a hoof problem since. She races around the pasture on her bare feet, happy as a clam.   TL;DR, it's worth it to try the shoes until her hooves are grown out enough that she's not standing on her soles. I would have her shod ASAP. Also, invest in some supplements. At the very least, powdered Knox Gelatin.   Edit: Also, it will cost you much less in vet and chiro bills. haha.   Edit 2: Also, she is no longer on any supplements or gelatin. Once her hooves were properly grown out, she was good to go."
Horses,3b8sin,Ephemeral_Halcyon,3,Fri Jun 26 22:26:58 2015 UTC,Shoes for now.  Spray the soles with iodine to help toughen them up.
Horses,3b8sin,kryrinn,2,Fri Jun 26 22:50:10 2015 UTC,"Growing a strong bare hoof takes time. Some people have the patience  and consistency to do it, others don't. If you want to put shoes on , just do it. If you want to keep her bare there are a few things you'll need to do to make it successful. Get her a pair of hoof boots that fit and until she is 100% sound put them on when you ride every time. Check her diet for any sources of sugar or carbs. This means getting your hay tested and only letting her graze at low sugar times of day, and no grain. (Carbs should stay below 10%). She needs to live on the same terrain that she will be ridden on. You must always make sure she can land heel first, that may mean boots all the time at first. Be meticulous about thrush. I am a bare hoof care practitioner and would be happy to answer any remaining questions that you have. You sound at least a bit horse savvy (knowing how to see dead sole) so that's great. If, however, this particular circus doesn't seem worth it to you, you can always go with shoes. Best of luck!"
Horses,3b8sin,-00-00,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:40:23 2015 UTC,"Second all of this.  The diet is extremely important in growing better hooves.  If you're not up for all of this, then it probly won't work.  If you go for shoes, there are some excellent plastic and composite shoes that allow for more natural hoof flexion and more shock absorption."
Horses,3b8sin,skipsteejsprat,2,Sat Jun 27 06:23:59 2015 UTC,If that were my horse I'd be getting radiographs to determine solar margins just to be safe. Make sure her she hasn't rotated or had a sinking coffin bone. You can get a couple of other views at each hoof to help the farrier plan a course of action to get her sound.
Horses,3b8sin,Ryveting,2,Sat Jun 27 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"It's good to know if there are internal problems if you plan on competing. Short term - glue-on composite shoes would really help her grow a healthy barefoot shape. Nails and metal shoes decrease circulation in the hoof. Also - navicular, arthritis, etc benefit from supportive shoes anyway, so if you can't afford the xrays, they would be your go to anyway if she did have a bone problem. Supplements with biotin, methionine and zinc really help too."

You only put them on for trail rides and rides on hard ground / gravel. It shouldn't be necessary in the arena though.  From what it sounds like i would recommend having the farrier put shoes on your horse again to recover and maybe try it again when her hooves are back to normal. Your horse is probably in pain, it's like us walking bare feet all the time without having enough callus on our soles. Someone else mentioned getting xrays done, do it! And maybe have an other vet look at her. Hooves are very delicat and wrong trimming / shoeing over a long period can change the angle of the bones in the leg and cause a lot of damage to the horse."
Horses,3b8sin,picala,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:17:22 2015 UTC,"It is not necessary to have shoes. I would find a competent barefoot trimmer in your area, many farriers only know how to pasture trim and not performance trim the barefoot hoof. You can use boots when riding, there are a number of options but Easyboots and Renegades are the top rated. It will take a while for your horse's feet to grow, but once they slowly start to toughen up you can cut back on the boot usage. Expecting to pull shoes and have her go perfectly is unfair to the horse and that's why people always say ""oh my horse has to have shoes."" If you transition slowly from shoes->hoof boots-> barefoot the process is very doable, just more work and lots of patience."

Horses,3b5acu,MsRenee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:42:27 2015 UTC,"They posted a photo and it's a weird one.    Mullen means a solid mouthpiece, snaffle is a jointed mouthpiece with no shanks.  It can be other than a d or o ring (e.g. Baucher) .  Something cannot be jointed and solid at the same time."
Horses,3b5acu,ZzShorty,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:24:24 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that snaffles weren't necessarily jointed and jointed bits weren't necessarily snaffles.  I've seen mullen mouth snaffles a number of times and never thought anything of it.  Tack terminology is so regional though.

Horses,3b8m4m,Splashathon,2,Fri Jun 26 21:16:55 2015 UTC,"In order to get antibiotics you will need a vet's prescription. SMZ are commonly used for general equine infection and there many topical solutions. I'm pretty sure I have administered Terramycin Ophthalmic ointment before. In the meantime, you can carefully rinse the eye with a saline solution and moisture the lids with petroleum jelly. In the dessert here, the horses get what looks like an eye infection from exposure to dry air, sun, dust and bugs especially if they do not wear a fly mask. Happy to hear the vet has been dispatched. Why did your neighbor not call you about the first infection?"
Horses,3b8m4m,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:30:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. We unfortunately moved to a place without cell service, and hardly ever left. We communicated over email, but Im also curious as to why she didnt tell us. Anyway, Ive been cleaning out his eye and having a fly mask on him, and the infection went away on its own. Makes sense, he was in a dustier than usual pen, its almost completely gone now, and the flies are getting pretty bad now."
Horses,3b8m4m,NeverendingStarchild,2,Wed Jul 1 06:07:04 2015 UTC,"Glad it cleared up! I was a bit freaked when the horse I work with could barely open his eyelid one day, but same thing - the flies/dust were irritating and the mask did the trick!"

Horses,3b903d,breannabalaam,6,Fri Jun 26 23:17:52 2015 UTC,You can see the dished face when the horse turns its head.
Horses,3b903d,dancingmillie,2,Fri Jun 26 23:20:37 2015 UTC,There are different types of Arabs. Polish and Egyptian.

I was going off of a comment by a friend about her convex shaped Arab vs my concave one."
Horses,3b903d,theawesomestest,4,Sat Jun 27 00:14:24 2015 UTC,"Having a straighter face does not mean the horse is poorly bred. There are different sub-types of Arabians and some have less of a dish. If you look at pictures of the foundation American Egyptian Arabs, they don't really have the tiny-super dished head."
Horses,3b903d,ellevt,2,Sat Jun 27 03:17:24 2015 UTC,"Usually the dish is more prominent on halter-bred Arabians, but lacking a dish doesn't make it poorly bred. Arabians are bred for lots of things and not all of them are just looking pretty."
Horses,3b903d,qwinz,3,Sat Jun 27 08:25:57 2015 UTC,"No doubt about them being Arab. There are so many types of Arabian horses. Egyptian, Polish,Russian, Crabbet, American, even Australian-bred Arabians have a bit of a different look to them.  these horses are a bit under-muscled, and that is contributing to the disproportion maybe. If the body was bulked up that head would look a lot daintier I think. that VERY dishy face you see in popular modern Arabians is nearly always seen on the Arab circuit (mainly in the halter ring) where it is truly becoming a cosmetically bred for trait. So terrible to see the breed going downhill... as is any popular breed unfortunately"

Horses,3b36nf,GeniusIamnot,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:47:29 2015 UTC,When he first cracked I went way forward and the reins went over his head. So when I got back to the middle they were on the one side.

It was always an oxer too. I yelled shit as I was going over. I had a lot of parents giving me the stink eye when I walked out the gate. Oh and the one time I volunteered to announce at my barns show, let just say a lot of shits and fucks where said before I could switch the mike off. I still get made fun of for that one.    Edit: I'll also add my arab LOVED for me to talk to him, so you bet whenever I was on him I was talking to him the WHOLE time.

Horse bucked, saddle slipped, my legs did something strange, and I was catapulted into a somersault into the ground. I was young and stupid. Now I always tighten the girth before I get on, once I'm on, and even after warmup sometimes. The back pain will never go away though."

Horses,3b0q4z,OneBigUhOh,3,Thu Jun 25 01:09:12 2015 UTC,"Probably just a benign cyst, wart or tumour.   If you're really worried keep the lump and give it to your vet to send off for testing.   Keep the wound area clean and put a wound salve on it. If it's under where your saddle pad goes I'd suggest a gauze pad of some sort to make sure dust and hair aren't getting ground into the open hole."
Horses,3b0q4z,altf4life,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:18:57 2015 UTC,That was my line of thought but do those sorts of things just pop out?
Horses,3b0q4z,altf4life,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:32:30 2015 UTC,a cyst will definitely.  warts generally fall off.   tumours don't usually
Horses,3b0q4z,billerz15,3,Thu Jun 25 02:24:49 2015 UTC,Could also be a warble fly larvae that died before it could exit the skin. Make sure you get a vet to have a look next time he/she is out at your place! You're right though probably not worth the service call in itself.
Horses,3b0q4z,silver_slinky,2,Thu Jun 25 09:19:44 2015 UTC,"Alrighty, my horse has this little hole in his back that you see in the picture. This came out of that hole. He had a little lump on his back for about two years that I assumed was a wart or something benign because it didn't appear to be tender, growing, or otherwise bothersome. Last night I was removing some dead skin from the area and this little thing just popped out. There was a teeny bit of blood just outside the hole that you can see near my finger but otherwise no fluids. The ball is slightly smaller than a pea and is solid but when i press my nail on it, it gets an imprint. It doesn't appear to have any legs or face and nothing looks like it ever had anything attached. I intend to get the vet out but since he has had it for two years I didn't think it was an emergency so I just cleaned it and let it be for now. Has anyone ever seen anything quite like this?"
Horses,3b0q4z,Splashathon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:10:12 2015 UTC,It really just looks like a cyst that has burst. If it were my horse I would probably just keep an eye on it and hold off on the vet for now.
Horses,3b0q4z,daydreams356,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:10:26 2015 UTC,It looks kind of like a blackhead. Maybe got big enough to come out without being pressed?
Horses,3b0q4z,qwinz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:32:14 2015 UTC,Bot fly larvae/warble emerging. The hole left can also collect dirt/etc which may be what you are seeing if it wasn't pupae casing.
Horses,3azs77,dyskutant,7,Wed Jun 24 20:38:30 2015 UTC,"Yes I play for a college team.   How did you get involved?     heard about it from a friend, it is the cheapest equestrian club at my school. ~300$ a semester, and there are no experence requirements to join the club. You have to try out to compete,  but not to play.   Did you have riding experience before you started?     I have been riding for 14 years, so I am one of the better riders, and it does help to know how to ride first. However anyone can join the club at my school so I'd say about half of the people who join each semester have little to no rideing experience. If you're a woman you're unlikely to be able to compete without previous experence because of how many women try out. As a man however... we had one guy make the team this year who had never ridden before this year (because we only had 4 guys try out). He did okay, only one bad injury.   Polo is a lot of fun hope you enjoy it."
Horses,3azs77,am-weiser,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:58:31 2015 UTC,Which school? If you don't mind me asking. I almost went to a school with a Polo team
Horses,3azs77,hoofbeats,3,Thu Jun 25 15:36:36 2015 UTC,"Only if wiffle ball bats and beach balls count!  I just discovered a polo barn about 40 minutes from me last fall when I did some training on a horse there. I mentioned it around the horse crowds and NOBODY had any idea it was there. Apparently it's totally separate and hush hush from every other barn and discipline in the area and I still never see a stitch of advertising,  notice of competitions, etc. My 17hh boy is not conducive to the sport haha"
Horses,3azs77,AtomicPenny,3,Wed Jun 24 21:45:11 2015 UTC,"Same here! The Houston Polo club never advertises and I was told that's because it's on land belonging to one of the most exclusive old-money societies in the area. A girl I ride with is friends with one of the players (lol she's the number 1, so self-proclaimed ""shittest"" on the team, but plays against male pros, so kudos!) and we get fancy box seats to the last game of the season. It's really cool to watch how nimble the horses and riders are, though I feel American players have exaggerated chair seats compared to the Argentinians they play with."
Horses,3b0etd,khillzzz,5,Wed Jun 24 23:32:13 2015 UTC,"What boot you use depends on the shape of your horses feet.  Easyboots are super great for oval shaped hooves. Cavallo are great for very round hooves. I've never heard of softride.   I use cavallo boots and they've been ok. My mare has VERY round hooves and her hooves grow out very flat, like a dinner plate. They're also leather so they shrink a bit. Last road ride I used them on this year, one of the boots kept twisting on her hoof. Just one.   Last season I used them quite a bit and was very happy with them. I'm going to try and look into easyboots in wide, but I don't have high hopes."
Horses,3b0etd,bearxfoo,2,Thu Jun 25 01:03:21 2015 UTC,Easyboot now makes a 'wide' line in the glove and back country to fit round hooves.  I ride in gloves on the rough trails and love them.  Never come off no matter what speed or terrain.  My horse takes a wide on the fronts and a regular on the backs (front feet a round and back feet oval)  I had easyboot epics without the gaitors when they first came out and I hated them.  They would fly off all the time at anything faster than a jog but they have come a long way.  Cavallos are alright but to me they have more play side to side than a well fitted glove and thus I wouldn't trust them at high speeds or grueling stuff but for meandering around they are more than sufficient.  Never heard of soft ride.
Horses,3b0etd,Allyz0r,2,Thu Jun 25 06:57:58 2015 UTC,"I haven't used these myself, but the endurance crowd really likes renegades.  http://www.renegadehoofboots.com/"
Horses,3b0etd,theawesomestest,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:41:55 2015 UTC,"I have used cavallo and they did what they were supposed to do. They're less elegant than some other brands.  No personal experience with easyboots, but people seem to be happy with them. Sometimes they lose them?   Renegades are often used in my country aswell, sometimes trouble with twisting around feet..  Don't know softride.  My current shoes are floating boots, but I don't think they are available where you are? You can heat them, which makes them flexible to make them fit around the hooves better, after they stay that shape. I don't think I have heard of much problems with the floating boots yet? Only that the 'sock' part crawls upwards. App a cavallo sock stays in place much better, but floating boots are still new and updating and trying to make it better every time. I heard they were going for better socks now :P   Whatever you use, FITTING IS IMPORTANT. If it doesn't fit it'll be all rubbing the wrong places and losing shoes :P Keep the shape of their hooves in mind too!"
Horses,3b0n4x,Helpmyhorse,6,Thu Jun 25 00:43:06 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I can't offer too much in the way of guesses, my honest suggestion would be to have a different vet come out, since it sounds like the first one isn't too helpful.  I'm saying that because if it's spreading, it could be almost anything - an allergy, something with her immune system, mites, maybe she's somehow rubbing it off, fungus, (I know your vet said it wasn't, but  a second opinion might still be good here.)  Good luck!"
Horses,3b0n4x,Confidence_Trickster,5,Thu Jun 25 01:45:24 2015 UTC,"I second the second-vet opinion. Thoroughbreds are notoriously thin skinned and sensitive to the weirdest things sometimes. They can be allergic to any number of things and even though one vet said it's not fungus/bacteria, it looks an awful lot like what we call rain rot. It can be brought on by the horse not being cleaned off and groomed when it sweats. I've also seem them allergic to their own sweat but this is typically accompanied by hives as well as hair loss.   Have you tried bathing the horse in anything- Microtek shampoo, hypoallergenic-oatmeal-type soothing soaps?"
Horses,3b0n4x,carbonarbonoxide,2,Thu Jun 25 02:02:27 2015 UTC,I know you live in dry heat so it could be mud fever (just a rash from the mud/ dirt) use medicated shampoo and keep it dry and clean.  He could also be rubbing his self and that causes hair loss like that.

Horses,3b0n4x,thedrcoma,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:47:52 2015 UTC,"The crusty white part is dried sweat. I'm in Arizona too. After cool out from a good ride, the horse I work with always has his butt covered in dried sweat while other parts like under the saddle pad, under boots, etc stay wet. Even if the horse is not being worked, he is sweating in the 100+ degree heat and the sweat leaves a salty residue. I would recommend offering your horse more shade. If night turn out is an option, try keeping him/her indoors during the day with the fans running. The hairless patches look like sunburn prior to blistering. Sunburn is more common on pink skin but dark skin can still burn."
Horses,3axcr3,Redefine_Sass,8,Wed Jun 24 06:51:38 2015 UTC,"Going gray for certain. Gray starts off as some other 'normal' like black or seal brown and progresses each year until eventually the horse snow white. Not all horses go gray at the same rate; as a 2 - year old this horse is going gray a little bit more slowly than the average gray, but not unusually so."
Horses,3axcr3,FirelordSprout,3,Wed Jun 24 07:29:43 2015 UTC,Thank you for that info! He'll be three in November so he is a little bit slow. Very exciting that he'll be grey and not a plain brown! :)
Horses,3axcr3,apopken,3,Wed Jun 24 07:37:11 2015 UTC,"I would suggest you look at the pedigree if available. The grey gene is dominant therefore one of the parents must be grey for the foal to grey. If neither parents are grey I would say this horse is brown with white hairs throughout, or maybe some type of roan/rabicano. Also, does he have grey around his eyes? That is usually a huge give away."
Horses,3axcr3,carbonarbonoxide,2,Wed Jun 24 10:25:20 2015 UTC,"You say that, but I had a grey mare with 2 bay parents (Cathalido and a TB mare), and 3/4 grey grandparents... Horse genetics are weird."

Besides, I think it's important that we understand how economics and policy influence the horse market.  It seems to have a large effect on what we breed into our horses, and can help explain why some bloodlines or conformation traits are favored over others.

Horses,3avx6m,DreamRaid,2,Tue Jun 23 22:51:03 2015 UTC,Maybe not directly. But breeding a lot of horses without a thought toward their use as a performance/working animal has probably had knock-on effects leading to that conclusion.

Horses,3awtdh,checksfan,5,Wed Jun 24 03:24:35 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing he still isn't 100% back to a good weight. What happened, if you don't mind me asking? Age, history of injury, and illness all make a difference when building a conditioning routine.   Assuming he is sound and healthy at this point, honestly the best thing to start with is a lot of walking. Hills are great- if your dirt mounds are nice and stable (won't sink his legs in and such) may be a good option. It also gives you an opportunity to get him bending through his body and following through/seeking contact with the bridle and building up his back at the same time. Everyone likes to say ""trot trot trot"" but that is physiologically the hardest gait on a horse (which is why it's used for lameness exams), and shouldn't be done a whole lot until he's built back some of that muscle, though it's great ""cardio"" for building fitness once you have the foundation."
Horses,3awtdh,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:32:53 2015 UTC,"He is 21 years old he is a chronic colicer and was diagnosed with laminitis about a year ago and was pulled off all alfalfa and put on grass hay. He has been moved from the place he got diagnosed at because they couldnt use him for lessons so they wanted to charge double the price. I moved him to a friends house where he recovered from his lamitis and became sound again. Her dog then attacked my boys stomach and when he ran her over in an attempt to get away (she survived with no injuries other than some bruising) I was told I need to find a new home for him.  He is now boarded at an old teacher of mine who became a friend's house. They feed bremuda grass hay, 1/2 flake of alfalfa is occasionally added to help with weight, and he gets beet pulp 2-3 times a day. I have also added integrity Promise which is low sugar and oat hay pellets once a day with beet pulp to help him gain and it is finally working. Rice bran which use to work great on him was having no effect.  Thank you for the suggestions i will definately start him with some walking in the arena and start utilizing the hills. I would post a picture to show where is is weight wise but i dont know how."
Horses,3awtdh,ze1da,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:31:16 2015 UTC,Don't be afraid to push him forward into a nice big walk with overstep. If you can get him power walking it should build up muscle really well through his whole body.
Horses,3awtdh,RonRonner,3,Sun Jun 28 04:26:36 2015 UTC,"Be very careful with soft sand and an unconditioned horse.  Deep sand can be very taxing and can put your horse at risk of soft tissue injury, which are very slow healing and a nightmare to rehab.  I totally agree with /u/carbonarbonoxide's advice and can't emphasize enough the importance of walking to build up muscle and condition.  It is absolutely the safest, gentlest way to rebuild fitness and muscle."
Horses,3auqw1,ShinyLikeACrow,2,Tue Jun 23 17:47:26 2015 UTC,"It's either a learned behavior or pain.  Rule out the 2nd first for both your sakes with a farrier and vet visit.  If that is clear it's learned. Maybe she had pain there previously,  some fluke bad experience,  etc. With learned behaviors they can get worse before they get better as they get called on it (2 rears vs 1) and you just continue with it, ignore their shit, and make them deal with it and eventually they knock it off."
Horses,3auqw1,AtomicPenny,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:52:19 2015 UTC,"or try to re-learn it, might be worth a shot after the pain is ruled out. I had a horse with a simple trust issue once and good results. he just didn't like his hooves cleaned or debris removed from his feathers. the owner always kindof wrestled with him to do it. Naturally that didn't convince him that hoof-cleaning could be good for anything.  I brought itty bitty carrot bits and said ""hoof"" everytime I wanted the hoof (and initally also kindof picked it up by myself). Once the hoof was clean he got a carrot bit.  After some time I could say hoof, he shuffled around a bit until he was comfortable to give it now and then lifted it up by himself. :)  I caught it and made sure to handle it gently, also to continue to give him a carrot bit for being so brave. Maybe bribery, but it was much better than the wrestling imho."
Horses,3auqw1,dunmorestriden,2,Wed Jun 24 21:31:03 2015 UTC,If you have a round pen with really really soft dirt and a good rope (like a roping rope not  lead rope) hook it around her pastern and pull gently until she picks it up. Take baby steps until she'll hold it up calmly. It's what we do when we start colts to get them calm for farriers and things. I've  never had a horse get hurt doing it (not even rubbing around the pastern) as long as your careful and patient it'll work
Horses,3auqw1,ClassicHoof,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:04:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, my 2 year old has this problem too. I did  not have a good roping rope so I used a leadrope at first, it was too ""dull"" for him so I switched to baling twine which also did not work, but rubbing it back and forth for the ""ask"" worked well! After one rub he would pick it up with pressure alone. Then after he was safe at picking up his foot with the rope, you ask them to hold it up with the rope. Use your hand only when you feel safe to do so!   My horse was wrestled into picking up his feet from 6 months to 2, he would be in his stall and shoved up against the wall to get his feet trimmed for the farrier. So proper training had to fix his mental breakdowns he had about picking up his feet!"

Horses,3auow5,Quiinton,4,Tue Jun 23 17:33:48 2015 UTC,"Physical issues that I've seen result in behavior changes: uveitis, lyme disease, ulcers, kissing spine.  Of these, I think the fact that he's more reactive sporadically and that it's worse outside point more to uveitis than the others, where I would expect either dramatic bucking (kissing spine) or more of a description of crankiness/nastiness/ticklishness (ulcers and lyme). Has he had a teary eye or eyes recently?  That said, in most cases I think this type of behavior change is environmental more than physical.  It's good to rule out physical (don't forget to check saddle fit too, but the fact that it's episodic doesn't make me think back pain right away) but you mentioning that you've struggled with nervousness makes me think that you may be more tense than you think and he's feeding off of it.  I say this as someone who is naturally a nervous rider and whose last three horses started out as bombproof and became explosive or reactive during the course of my riding them.  All from very different backgrounds, with extensive diagnostic work to rule out pain and the only common element among them was me. Inevitably one of them would have a normal horse-with-a-pulse reaction to something scary and then we'd enter into this negative feedback loop of me being afraid the horse is going to explode, and the horse exploding because I'm spending my whole ride hoping he won't explode.  Then I get mad at myself for getting nervous and sabotaging my own rides and spend my time at the barn tense and guilty and disappointed. It's not a good starting point and I tend to get stuck in ruts there.  I don't know that you're feeling that way but I will say that a lot of what you wrote sounded familiar to me.  If you're genuinely feeling comfortable with him, then just ride through his naughtiness and don't acknowledge it.  When he bolts, put leg on and make him go a lap or two longer than when he wants to stop.  Make silliness more work than it's worth.  It's empowering to you and annoying to him.  Eventually his focus will return to you and I bet he'll settle back down into quieter, more reliable work.  If you're not comfortable riding through it, start with baby steps.  Get him back in a solid program like you're already planning, longe him before you ride him (every ride! It takes the edge off of him, establishes a routine, and helps act like a lucky talisman that tells you he'll be good today), do some in-hand work before you get on, take him for long walks around the property in-hand and refocus on your time out of the saddle.  Keep your rides within your comfort zone until you get bored, and then slowly expand your repertoire.   Don't feel guilty and don't beat yourself up over it.  Another reason I think this is probably environmental rather than physical is that it's so common.  The number of quiet horses that stay quiet horses with nervous riders is very small.  The number of quiet horses whose behavior eventually changes is very, very high.  I think the only way past it is through it, and then it tends to resolve itself quickly."
Horses,3auow5,RonRonner,2,Tue Jun 23 18:54:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all the advice! He hasn't had teary eyes lately, but yes I think it may be that I'm more tense than I think.   I'll make sure I lunge him before I ride, and if he's in more regular work that'll help as well - I think once he starts to stop (if you know what I mean?) it'll clear up fairly well, but if nothing helps I'll probably get him vetted. Thanks again!"
Horses,3auow5,DreamRaid,2,Tue Jun 23 19:22:11 2015 UTC,"I have seen ""bombproof"" horses turn nutty and into brats when a person who is nervous rides them regularly. I have also seen complete nutters make a huge change in one ride when the rider's confidence is up. It sounds to me like you are more tense than you realize. I've had the same issue of turning a horse into a mess because I was nervous, and I'm still not quite sure how I got over it. I just walked out one day and decided that he and I were going to do this--and we've been a team ever since.   I would ask your trainer for help and ideas on how to control your nervousness. I know how hard it can be to even realize you're nervous!"
Horses,3auow5,DreamRaid,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:08:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think he's so much better at shows because we have more of a routine at shows, and when we're competing I have the attitude of ""We ARE doing this, and we ARE going to do our best, and we ARE going to make perfect rounds no matter what."", whereas at home I'm more tense and not really sure what's going to happen.

Horses,3auow5,Msustarr,2,Tue Jun 23 23:50:38 2015 UTC,This horse likely wasn't as well trained as you thought in the first place.  Any change in a tightly controlled routine for a horse whose training is not generalized for environment will likely have the problems you have with the horse.  Proper training is varied enough to Generalize for environment and overcome any changes.  I would discourage you from the lunging instead of riding. Perhaps you are not riding as much so this Iunging is becoming more frequent.  Mindlessly lunging a horse is training without scientifically based thinking behind it.  It is largely tradition and teaches learned helplessness. This learned helplessness can transfer to being ridden in an arena because it is so similar to where they are coerced into being lunged without any escape.
Horses,3auow5,TheNapier,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:15:02 2015 UTC,"No, he hasn't been trained extensively. Nobody knows when he was backed, but we know he was a trail horse until he was 9, which is when I started riding him. At that point in early 2012, he was out of shape, and couldn't handle being away from other horses at all, as in couldn't work without being right behind another horse (trail horses...). As of this year, it's his third year showing in the hunters, and what he's been doing has been largely varied - we did dressage for a long time, he's done hunters, he took a break from dressage when the owner didn't allow me to ride him for a few months, we were just getting back into it when my coach retired, etc... so his work has been quite varied over the last few years, although it hasn't followed any kind of strict training plan or routine.   Honestly at this point he's only been lunged once or twice just to work him, and any other time has been for the vet/because he's been lame so to check on him/etc.   Can you elaborate a bit more? I'm not sure what the learned helplessness is, or what effect it will have on him. My thought with the lunging is so that he could get out his ""explosive"" energy, get listening to the person on the ground, and hopefully start coming more onto the bit so he can work his crest muscles and start coming into a frame again (when we were riding dressage regularly he was starting to get it, although couldn't hold it for long because he doesn't have enough muscle - when I was taken off of him we lost it and because of no dressage haven't been able to get him working in a frame regularly)."
Horses,3auow5,TheNapier,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:30:31 2015 UTC,How did he go from being herd bound and only willing to walk in line to doing hunters and dressage?  The trainer?
Horses,3auow5,randomblonde,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:44:52 2015 UTC,"Just lots of work, getting him used to being away from the rest of the horses, etc. I would just take him out and do whatever exercises with the other horses on one side of the ring, and us on the other, until he could do them without being by the other horses. Of course there was a lot of veering back to them, breaking to a walk/trot when we would pass the other horses, but he got used to it after a few months.   Now it's not an issue at all, for the most part we ride alone at shows (since I have to ride alone in the ring to do my rounds), and there's no problem.   *EDIT: At that point the trainer wasn't riding him at all, it was pretty much just myself and the occasional ride by another lesson kid at our old barn. The new owner bought him from the old barn after that, and that's when the trainer took over. He was just flat/simple exercises until the new owner bought him, at which point the trainer started training him hunters, and I started working with him dressage."

Horses,3au09o,sweetcatofmine,5,Tue Jun 23 14:29:22 2015 UTC,"How long has he been at your barn?   Seeing as he is medically okay and his tack is fine, it's probably due to a painful saddle earlier in his life and being spoiled by a past owner. It's fixable, but it will take time. The trick is to be super confident and very patient. If he's in your personal space, make him back off by just waving your arms around and claiming your space back. If he's threatening to kick you, a short smack on his butt may help. Don't praise or feed him anything unless he is calm and respectful towards you. if he's calm and patient, release pressure by taking a step back yourself and standing still. It takes a LOT of time, but at one point he will understand that acting up = uncomfortable and being nice = release of pressure.  I'd also advise you to do groundwork to define your relationship better. You want to be a leading figure for him who he can trust."
Horses,3au09o,I_like_your_unit,2,Tue Jun 23 15:55:26 2015 UTC,"He's been at the barn for 7 months. Newish.  I'm going to try to be a lot more sensitive to my position when I'm working with him. It has never really occurred to me to reward him by taking a step back myself. Thanks for the advice, I will definitely try it.  Unfortunately I can't do a lot of ground work with him because I'm only there for my lesson slot. We're supposed to arrive 20 minutes early to groom and tack up, but I've been going 40 minutes early so I'm not rushing him. I have about 30-40 minutes with him before my lesson every week, and about 20 minutes after.   Do you think he will remember what we've worked on week or week, or will the next student who comes along and rides him just undo what we've accomplished?"
Horses,3au09o,I_like_your_unit,2,Tue Jun 23 16:25:04 2015 UTC,"That's tricky. It's definitely possible to teach him things while the other riders don't actively train him, but if they are going to accidentally reward him for his bad behaviour then it could be very hard. Maybe you can discuss it with the owner? It's also in their interest to have a well-behaved horse."
Horses,3au09o,AuntieChiChi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:43:29 2015 UTC,"I think that will depend on his personality.  My lesson pony (who is my half-lease over the summer) acts differently around me than he does around other students and his owner. He's also an older dude (just turned 21) and set in his ways a bit now. His owner spoils him rotten, but that includes letting him be rude.  He drags her when he's on the lead rope, head butts for attention & scratches, and is an absolute dick if there is food involved (treats included).    I don't put up with that kind of behavior.  Of course, that means a lot of correcting of his behavior and telling him NO and all that.  This is the 2nd summer I have half-leased him, and our third year together total.  Until last summer I only rode him once a week during our lessons, with time before and after to hang out, with an occasional extra ride here and there. With the half-lease, I get to ride him 3-4 times a week, but only for the summers; the rest of the year it's back to once a week.    I have worked and worked to teach him that I don't take the bullshit from him like everyone else does.  It took him quite some time after I started working on those behaviors for him to realize that I meant it, even if everyone else lets him get away with it.  My trainer has noticed that he doesn't pull his shit with me like he does with his owner or some of the other students, so it has worked.  He's still a dick about feeding time, and I don't do treats often because he's an ass about that too (he gets a big bucket full of gatorade at the end of our ride as a treat from me, that's it!).  He will periodically check to make sure I really mean it by trying to rush while we are walking, or by headbutting me (much more gently than he used to), but I just remind him that we don't do that.  I am working this summer on teaching him to respect my space a little more, and it is slow because the other people he spends time with don't do this with him, but I think that if I am consistent, he will understand this too.    It can't hurt to try it, even if others are ""undoing"" your work.  Good luck!"
Horses,3au09o,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:46:47 2015 UTC,"What is his facial expression when he is lifting the leg? Are his ears pinned back? Is he showing you his teeth? Lifting a leg is not a sign of aggression unless the body language of an aggressive horse accompanies the leg lift. He could have had a fly on his belly. He could just be really cinchy. If it happens while you are grooming he could just be anticipating what hoof you will pick next. Obviously, be careful - you're working with a horse, don't turn your back on a horse ever but I would give this guy the benefit of doubt. I would make sure he is covered in fly spray and rule out shivers. My friend's GP horse had mild shivers and whenever his back feet were being picked he moved the leg around like he was trying to kick when in reality he had a neurological condition beyond his control."
Horses,3au09o,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:51:04 2015 UTC,"Does he actually strike out? While you are taking off the martingale you shouldn't really be in a spot where he could really nail you. This is going to sound terrible, but many accomplished show jumpers and just about every TB I know are sensitive and quirky in their own way, and sometimes it's better to ignore things like that if they aren't actually hurting anyone, particularly in an older horse who may have always done it.   My friend's GP mare will chomp the air near you (like, mouth open 8 inches and clap it shut like a freaking dragon) and raise her legs like she is going to kick the shit out of you for anything from currying, tacking up, putting on sheets/blankets and fly spray. But she never actually makes contact or aims it at anyone but the air. So you just do what you're gonna do with a hairy eyeball on her, and realize that while it looks terrifying, she isn't going to hurt you.   BUT that said, there is a difference between a harmless scary-looking quirk and a horse that is trying to hurt you. Outright aggression is the only time i feel it is okay to hit your horse on the ground without any kind of warning. I would definitely stop giving him any treats by hand for several months, until the rude/bitey behavior stops, and ""bite"" him back for invading space (slap on the nose is my go-to, because that is the offending part). Make sure you pair it with a verbal command, so that in the future, the verbal is all you need when you feel his head getting too invasive, to let him know that the next step is a slap on the nose.   I wouldn't harp too much on the leg lifting until he actually attempts to strike out at you- I've known lots of horses that do it and it's just a thing they do without trying to hurt the handler. If he lifts AND swings it, a spank with a hand or crop (after my horse learned to bully a farrier that was afraid of her, I had to keep a crop in my boot/pocket for a few weeks to remind her that I won't tolerate that crap, and she IS a bad kicker) paired with the word ""NO"" every time. Immediate reaction is the key.   As far as the pawing, focus on positive reinforcement when he just stands nicely. I find most horses that paw excessively are actually doing it for attention. If every time he paws you go tell him off, he is kind of getting what he wants. Not unlike a child. I got much better results by utterly ignoring the pawing and praising the heck out of my horse for standing quietly."
Horses,3au09o,carbonarbonoxide,2,Tue Jun 23 16:04:20 2015 UTC,"The pawing is actually the one behaviour I have been ignoring, because I can keep track of my own feet and he won't hurt me that way. The only time I tell him ""no"" is when I am trying to put his boots on.  The barn I am at is really low tolerance for horsey-antics. The grooms get aggressive with the horses if they catch them acting up, and they aren't coddled at all. The barn expects the horses to behave politely and most of them do. I get annoyed because I'll just get Venti in a calm, relaxed state and if he happens to paw when a groom walks by they will jump in and smack him and yell. That puts us back to the crab stepping antics we started out with.   We don't give them any treats by hand, ever. The barn staff will give them mints or carrots from a bucket, but only after the lessons are done for the day. The students are not permitted to feed them anything.  As for the leg lifting, he didn't strike out. We didn't give him a chance. I was talking to him and my co-rider was taking his tack off slowly, and stopping every time he lifted his leg until he put it down again. We avoided striking distance. We didn't push him far enough for him to strike out, so I don't know if he would. He's never even lifted his leg at me before, so I wasn't taking any chances.  I definitely hope we can work on it. The barn acquired a stunning Warmblood with a big dressage background a few months ago and then promptly got rid of him for stuff like this. I'm really hoping they don't get rid of Venti also, because I am learning so much riding a horse like him."
Horses,3au09o,LiEnBe,7,Tue Jun 23 16:34:58 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'd never heard of grooms going out of their way to discipline a horse that they weren't even handling at the time. Poor guy- no wonder he is nervous! It's probably a bit confusing for someone to just pop in and punish him randomly. We usually leave discipline up to the person that is actively riding/handling the horse to avoid confusion and creating a fearful attitude that any passers-by can punish them even though they're not offending that particular person. I think that system messes with their head, honestly, because herd instinct/dynamic doesn't work like that- the lead mare doesn't come up and bite horse A for annoying/disrespecting horse B.   I suppose owners aren't doing their talented horses any favors (me and my friend included) by picking our battles and ""letting"" them be quirky. But a lot of talented horses, again, are sensitive and exhibit strange behaviors (especially after years of showing) and aren't cut out to be deadheads on a lesson string. It's a shame your stable doesn't understand stuff like that, because I imagine they miss out on having some nice animals because of stupid shit like pawing/biting the air. I get it if your program is full of timid people and children because they need a little extra supervision around horses like that, but it's no less a shame."
Horses,3au09o,carbonarbonoxide,2,Tue Jun 23 16:48:50 2015 UTC,"I used ""grooms"" to be polite, but it is a girl who works in the barn who looks to be about 14 years old. I've asked her to stop stepping in a few times, but I get the impression she thinks she is showing off that she knows what to do. Don't get me wrong, she's a very accomplished young rider, just overzealous.  The barn keeps quirky and talented horses who are in the show program, but if they're intended for regular lessons they don't seem to stick around. It is unfortunate because there are many talented riders who could handle quirkier horses who simply choose not to participate in the showing program, but I suspect they must be attempting to protect the beginner students by limiting lesson horses who are too quirky. The barn is a ""complete beginner to advanced showing"" type place.   Venti is done showing for now, so hopefully he'll stick around just based on the fact they are reserving him for a limited number of adult lesson students.   Thank you so much for your thorough responses!"

Right here you ""praised"" him for lifting his leg. He lifted it because you were doing something that he didn't like. Whenever he lifted it you stoped what you were doing and thus lifting the leg made you go away. When a horse reacts wrongly to something you do you need to keep doing it untill he stops and then you stop.   This is important in all training of horses, animals, kids etc. You apply a force (pressure from the legs, bit etc) as soon as the horse reacts correctly you let go of the pressure. If he doesn't react correctly you escalate pressure or keep it at whatever level you are at, untill he reacts correctly."
Horses,3au09o,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:31:07 2015 UTC,"I was definitely picking up on that error as it was happening. That is why I walked away from the situation knowing he had won and feeling concerned about it repeating next week.   In the moment, I was intimidated and wasn't willing to get kicked to push the issue. In reality, I had him cross tied in an open stall with his butt to a wall - he probably couldn't have nailed me anyway.  I need to work on my own ground confidence. Due to my old barn, I have more riding experience than ground experience and I just learned to tack up myself six months ago. I still get nervous bridling Venti because the moment you flinch he puts his nose up to the ceiling (and he's tall!) and I feel like I've lost control of the situation.   I'm working on upping my lessons to twice a week, so hopefully more horse time will improve my confidence and I will be able to be more assertive on the ground and more able to handle these pesky moments."
Horses,3au09o,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:39:14 2015 UTC,"Has anyone showed you how to bridle with your forearm along the poll, hand between the ears? My mare is tall and a dick about ""giraffing"" sometimes too!  In case they haven't shown you:   Undo the crossties so he is standing in just his halter, and see how he reacts to poll pressure from your fingers first. If he doesn't yank his head up, he should ""break"" at the poll and lower his head. This is when you grab the crown of the bridle in the right hand, slide your forearm over his poll to maintain the lowered head, get the bit situated in your left hand, and slide it on. Don't worry about all the straps on the sides until the crown and the bit are secure, then you can straighten out everything else. It's a bit awkward but will get better with practice!"
Horses,3au09o,LiEnBe,2,Wed Jun 24 15:58:39 2015 UTC,"This is brilliant! I am definitely going to try this out next week. I usually reach under his head and hold above his nose with my right hand so he can't ""giraffe"" (love this, by the way, perfect description) but it requires holding the bridle awkwardly in my right hand (below the brow band) so that the bit can reach his mouth.   Holding the bridle below the brow band so I can keep a hang on his head collapses the bit, and I always end up with one of his rubber bit guards in his mouth, which he hates (I don't blame him - I hate picking it out, also!)"

Horses,3arxni,Marcosprochovs,8,Tue Jun 23 00:50:19 2015 UTC,"I would NEVER buy a horse for someone who has never ridden before. Even if they are serious about riding and the animals, they cannot possibly know the extent of the commitment they are getting themselves into. Get the person to try some riding lessons under a reputable instructor in your area on ""school horses"" or the stable's horses (most lesson plans include horses that are offered for use). If this person like riding and is looking to further invest into the sport/animal try a lease horse. There are sure to be many lease horses in your are that are suitable for a beginner and thus this person can experience the responsibilities of full ownership without the legal commitments of actually owning a horse. After this person has gained some experience in the horse world and has confirmed that horse ownership is right for them then they may be able to look for a horse. As the what they should look for: a clam trusty steed that has room for them to improve their abilities while being trained well enough to let this new rider gain confidence."
Horses,3arxni,mistymouser,6,Tue Jun 23 01:03:09 2015 UTC,Somebody who has never ridden before is absolutely not ready to have their own horse. I would not even consider the idea. They need lessons for a while before they'll have enough hands-on experience to be ready to own.

Plus, even if you don't like our advice, think this way. Every rider is different and will like a different type and personality of horse. Much better to have them ride and figure out what they like and then have them choose a compatible horse, rather than being stuck with a random one for 20 years. What you want to do is kind of like an arranged marriage, whereas it's better to let them ""date around"" and then choose their own."

Horses,3alyyx,ponybloom,3,Sun Jun 21 15:06:05 2015 UTC,"I've played My Horse for years. It got silly for me so I only play  it rarely now. To many unicorns, zebras, etc. What I liked: competition, grooming, opportunities to play with your horse (feed snacks, etc), tack What I disliked:  silly tack (really? Santa saddles?), not being able to see all your horses at one time, competition is easily won by buying expensive tack, nothing to do outside of competition  Make a good one - I'd buy it!"
Horses,3alyyx,dorkofnight,2,Sun Jun 21 21:48:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely most of the game should be centered around other things than competition. All horse people know that it's what we do outside the competition that is the most important.   I also want tack to be a big part of the game, but only real life tack, and you have to be the best leatherworker in the game to make the best equipment. Also, all equipment is worn by the actual horse in the graphics. when you unequip it, it disappears from the picture."
Horses,3alyyx,stridersriddle,2,Mon Jun 22 21:07:56 2015 UTC,"I played Howrse (enjoyed) and neopets, but not the others.  I also had all the riding star games, equestrade, Final stretch, Riding with Pippa Funnel ect.   I really liked Howrse, but wished there was more graphics.  I always pictured a game that sort of combined Howrse with a Zoo Tycoon sort of game, so you'd see your horses out in pasture, and click the pasture to manage the horses in it, and you can add different paddocks for different breeding objectives.    The mobile phone game ""My Horse"" was pretty fun, but I lost interest within two weeks, but take a look at it, the graphics were decent, and I liked that there were competitions that ranked you based on how other people did, but you didn't have to wait like in Howrse.  I know nothing about code.  But I'll test the game when you're done."
Horses,3alyyx,hoofbeats,6,Sun Jun 21 16:49:41 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with your point of having a game like zoo tycoon but with horses, I'm an adult and I'd play that in a heartbeat. I was also really into playing howrse when I was younger. Also horseland."
Horses,3alyyx,hoofbeats,2,Sun Jun 21 18:07:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment, I'm far away from having 3d-graphics like some of the examples, but I've only just started. I'll definitely consider your points."
Horses,3alyyx,hoofbeats,3,Sun Jun 21 17:37:16 2015 UTC,"Amazon has a game called pocket Stables where you own your own racing barn and train your horses. Super fun, check it out if you'd like some ideas. It would be cool to have something similar but for all types of riding and more about horse care."
Horses,3alyyx,myheartisstillracing,3,Sun Jun 21 18:10:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, the plan is to focus more on horse care and give the player the opportunity to have different professions. Not only vets and farriers, but also leatherworkers that can make equipment like saddles and bridles, farmers that grow food etc. Basically the whole picture should be part of the game.  I'll research on how to make the game more ""tycoony"", I also love tycoon games."
Horses,3alyyx,hoofbeats,2,Sun Jun 21 18:29:49 2015 UTC,"I've wanted a game like that for years, you rock for doing this!"
Horses,3alyyx,rottingseams,3,Mon Jun 22 16:05:53 2015 UTC,"Wow, I just looked up Horseland for the first time in probably almost two decades. That website was how I learned there was more to ""the internet"" than the AOL interface. Let's just say that game looks like it's come a long way since I was using Netscape Navigator to find horse pictures to assign to my horses.  I think it would be fun to see all aspects of horse care. Need to make sure the farrier come by, etc."
Horses,3alyyx,mynameismilton,2,Mon Jun 22 02:27:30 2015 UTC,I remember sneaking downstairs really early in the morning to play it since my mom didn't approve of me being online.
Horses,3alyyx,mynameismilton,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:07:14 2015 UTC,Definitely! I hope to add as much as possible of what we do in everyday life to care for our horses.
Horses,3alyyx,sochelsey,2,Wed Jun 24 18:37:19 2015 UTC,"I feel the same, I prefer the games that feel realistic. I haven't got the color genetics up yet, but that is a must have in my game. And of course, the colors should also look right.  Speaking of personalaities, the horses in the game actually have a couple of personality stats. It's not fully incorporated yet, but horses have to have a specific personality to work well in some disciplines.   Riders will definitely be a part of the game, I think I'll add it as one of the many professions a player can have."
Horses,3alyyx,OliviaRBG,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:24:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that means a lot. You're right, making the forum is on my to do list, but still it's nice to have it confirmed that someone else also thinks it should be up. It will be up soon, probably this weekend :)"
Horses,3alyyx,esticiet,3,Wed Jun 24 18:16:55 2015 UTC,I see it's called pocket pastures - although I'm wondering if it's open for anyone to sign up for now?

Horses,3alyyx,jlm0305,3,Thu Jun 25 11:26:40 2015 UTC,"I played a Barbie Horse riding game once and honestly it was amazing. The best part about it was the free feeling of it. Barbie could go galloping through woodland trails (but you had to be careful! Too fast and the horse might tire, or you wouldn't see those pesky logs you had to jump and branches you had to duck). There was an immense feeling of freedom despite being confined to the path, and the cantering horse motion is quite soothing...  Similarly, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time had nice horse riding segments. Same freedom feeling, and you had to point Epona at fences at the correct speed and angle or she'd refuse and rear up.  So, hacking segments? Not just horse in stable, horse in show ring."
Horses,3alyyx,poetoflove,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:59:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, the riding in Ocarina of Time really is special. I would love to have segments like this, but I'm afraid that is some way down the road. I hope that the game can still give a feeling that you can ""do whatever you like"" even if it isn't 3d. Thanks for taking your time to comment!"
Horses,3alyyx,diamonte,2,Wed Jun 24 18:17:37 2015 UTC,"No worries, I love helping with game design ideas! Best of luck with it :)"
Horses,3alyyx,qwinz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:41:09 2015 UTC,The Barbie one! Wasn't there a kind of mystery to solve? I remember a magical stallion of some sort.
Horses,3alyyx,qwinz,2,Wed Jun 24 18:20:55 2015 UTC,"I used to play My Horse for Android and I really really loved it, but as you progress in levels it wants more and more in app purchases... Also, a lot of the tack was unrealistic and there were limited coat colours and only one real breed besides unicorns and zebras (I think it was trying to be thoroughbred, shows how much developers knew) I'd definitely play something that allowed players to have any horsey profession, and maybe had little quizzes about horsey knowledge that became harder as you went up the levels? If you made it a story where there were scenarios that you had to pick the right answer to get the most coins or something..?  Please keep us all updated though, I am really keen to see what you've made! Also, you say its already up and running, so whats it called?  Good Luck!!!"
Horses,3alyyx,indusbutt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:22:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, the game is up, but its more like a framework for a game than an actual game. You can't do much other than like buy and sell horses and equip items + a little more. But it is open because I want people to tell me what they think and if they like the feel of the design and the features as they are know. I've certainly got loads of ideas from all the comments, so I'm really looking forward to the weekend when I can get started.   The game is called pocketpastures.com and Ive been working on it for about a month, so please remember that it's only a baby :)"
Horses,3alyyx,ColourMePretzel,2,Wed Jul 1 04:11:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the link!! I'll definitely give it a shot and tell you what I think of it. I already want to give you an award for doing this. I'm playing Howrse right now and even though I like the game, it gets kind of boring. Not to mention it's next to impossible to actually rank well if you don't spend real life money on it! (I suggest you find alternatives for better items than only spending money for it)"
Horses,3alyyx,bsaana80,3,Mon Jun 22 13:33:36 2015 UTC,"I think many people experience this when playing most games/apps today. Apps are almost always purely made so that some people in suits can earn as much money as possible. They are made to be annoying unless you pay, and there is no way you can be a well ranked player if you don't use real money.  My game will have a premium subscription, and perhaps some other features that you have to pay for. At the moment I am paying for the servers and everything out of my own pocket, and I hope that some people after a while will like the game so much that they want to support it, or that there are features that they like so much that they want to pay a little extra to access more of them.  I will never allow anyone to pay real money to ""ungeld a horse"", make a horse younger, guarantee twins or anything like that. The only way to succeed in the game is to play it and if you really like playing, perhaps you will help me pay for the servers."

Horses,3amyut,Put_a_dick_in_it,2,Sun Jun 21 22:07:45 2015 UTC,Sunnybrook stables is right down town and offers beginner lessons. You might also look at the horse palace riding academy at the CNE fairgrounds
Horses,3amyut,thevoodoothatyoudo,2,Sun Jun 21 22:20:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely check out the Horse Palace at Exhibition Place. I go to the Royal Winter Fair held there every year and the stables are really nice, multilevel. The ring is a bit small but it is indoors and the ceilings are two storeys high and there is a ton of natural light."
Horses,3amyut,sweetcatofmine,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:55:07 2015 UTC,"Do you know if they have an outdoor ring there at all? I may be moving to Toronto next year for university, and since I'm fairly close, would like to bring my horse - but he doesn't enjoy small indoor rings and gets bored over the winter, so I like to keep him working outside as long as I can."
Horses,3amyut,Quiinton,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:00:56 2015 UTC,"During the show they have two small outdoor rings - think lunging size, but they are contained by 2 storey stone walls on all four sides. The only thing that makes them ""outdoor"" is that they don't have a roof.  However, I'm not sure if that is something they keep year round or if the footing is just placed for the show.   The stables are shared with the Toronto police horses, also :)"
Horses,3amyut,sweetcatofmine,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:38:53 2015 UTC,"Ok, thank you for the info! I'll probably take a look, but from your description I'm not sure if it's somewhere I would want to board long term."
Horses,3amyut,Quiinton,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:23:13 2015 UTC,"I would take lessons there, but I probably wouldn't board there either, to be honest. It is also literally downtown Toronto so you are stuck on site unless you haul out a good distance."
Horses,3amyut,sweetcatofmine,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:39:24 2015 UTC,"Mmm yeah, it does sound like more of a lesson barn than a boarding barn."
Horses,3amyut,Quiinton,2,Tue Jun 23 16:44:17 2015 UTC,Sunnybrook Stables and the Horse Palace are both downtown TO but very expensive due to location unfortunately. Most of the barns near Toronto are in the nearby towns such as Stouffville.

Horses,3ajwjg,corrikopat,6,Sun Jun 21 01:29:40 2015 UTC,"My husband gets it, but a lot of my friends aren't so lucky. Notably an outright yelling match about their show bill: ""YOU WANT A 39¢ RIBBON?

Horses,3ajwjg,AtomicPenny,2,Sun Jun 21 02:10:12 2015 UTC,I agree. I can easily put all my ribbons up. if I had a two dozen horse trophies it would get annoying. I think for big shows they are great. But I don't need a trophy for getting second at a local show.

Horses,3ajwjg,TheMilkSlut,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:05:35 2015 UTC,"I've seen people get pretty lucky at auctions. You can pick up an OTTB, yearling, or cruelty seizure horse for very cheap, particularly if it's an auction known for slaughterhouse patrons. The downside is you usually have to train, if that's a downside for you at all.  Some can come with issues that don't necessarily show up at auction, though."
Horses,3ajwjg,AtomicPenny,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:58:30 2015 UTC,"I was really just being sarcastic, because any person, particularly in my area is spending much more than $500 on any show horse.

I don't usually like orange or lemon zest.  I have been thinking about making a honey based cheesecake instead of white sugar. I was thinking maybe heating and mixing the sour cream and honey together first then mixing in the honey sour cream. I'm not sure if that would make a big difference but it would help the honey mix in better. Or maybe trying brown sugar?  Oh! For the crust, (I knew there was something I was forgetting) I do a sugar & cinnamon to add flavor to the graham crackers (you could get the cinnamon sugar crackers but putting fresh ingredients results in much better flavor."

Practice good posture everywhere- I struggle too because I have a desk job, spend a lot of time on airplanes and in the car where it's easy to slouch. And I have mild scoliosis, so my right shoulder always hunches and to get it in the right spot is a big effort and feels super awkward. Everyone has mild incongruities in their body and you have to learn what ""right"" feels like and do it consistently. A trainer on the ground or a mirror can be a great help."
Horses,3acw9d,Synaxis,8,Fri Jun 19 02:13:47 2015 UTC,"I have used a cooling vest, and they are very climate-dependent. In California desert land here, they're very helpful. I get heatstroke easily and miserable heat rashes, even hives. Cooling vests keep it under control. When I lived in Houston, it really didn't do much. Now mind you, Houston has the climate akin to being sandwiched in satan's armpit. It's likely that God never intended humans to settle there, in which case the lack of options makes sense. Anyway, it wasn't that it didn't help, I just really struggled having not been raised in that kind of humidity.   A few other things I do that make a difference for me:   essential peppermint oil in water, and a sprayer. I put a few drops in one of those fan/squeeze bottles. I don't care if I look like a menopausal woman before my time, I'm all over it -- it HELPS. if you board, for me it was worth the extra 10 minute drive to a facility that had lights and a covered arena. Fewer bugs, and I could actually handle the evening temperature rather than the afternoon. I even started coming sometimes in the early morning before work.  wet that hair, girl. The blood vessels in your ears and head are closer to the surface of the skin. It's a great cooling system. I stick ice cubes in my ear (don't laugh at me) -- and literally pour water over my head from the hose. You will be shocked how much cooler you stay. Now you'll look less like a hormonal woman and more like someone off their rocker. But a cool one. in the same vein, bandanas were originally worn by Cowboys for good reason. They'd get them wet and wear them around their necks to help keep them cool. It actually really helps, and if you rock it right it's adorable.  wear linen or cotton long sleeves. There's a reason they do it in the Middle East. It's not just an idle thing, I'm a fiber/textile nerd, polyester and nylon retain heat. They don't wick moisture. Don't underestimate that, and keeping the sun off your skin and allowing it to breathe will help a lot. Unless of course you live in Houston. If so? Abandon all hope.   At any rate, cooling vests are worth a try, so is the little cooling yarmulke they make. Even my horse learned to love the peppermint oil and the misting fan, it's very helpful. Hope this helps!"
Horses,3acw9d,thelurkess,2,Fri Jun 19 04:50:23 2015 UTC,"This is great, thanks! I'm so glad to know I'm not the only one who struggles with the heat. I never realized how sensitive to it I am until I began riding. I was leading the horse back to the barn after my second ever riding lesson and passed out before I took ten steps.. and so began my summertime struggle. I've tried all the basic stuff - drinking a ton of water, lots of electrolytes, a light snack, spending more time outside to try to 'adjust' or whatever.. The only thing that made a difference at all was completely avoiding situations where I'd wind up with heat exhaustion, which means keeping strenuous physical activity to the early morning, late evening, or on especially cool days and stopping as soon as I start feeling crappy. It's lame, because everyone else is out there having fun and riding and I'm just sitting inside being jealous.  Unfortunately up here in NJ the humidity is half the battle, which is why I haven't bit the bullet and gotten a cooling vest already. I'm not sure how well they'd work here and I don't really want to spend the money on one just to find out it actually makes me feel worse.   essential peppermint oil in water   I'm not familiar with essential oils. Does this make you sticky? I'd rather be a little sticky than overheated, of course. Do you just spray this on the head and face and neck every so often?    facility that had lights and a covered arena   The barn where I take my lessons has a lighted indoor, so this is covered! Unfortunately ""the latest lesson you have"" is seldom late enough to beat the heat, but this one is covered! The barn where I do my pleasure and trail riding is outdoor only with little to no shade, so... :(   I stick ice cubes in my ear (don't laugh at me)    NGL when I first read this this morning, I did giggle. How do you even get them to stay?! Wetting the hair is doable.   bandanas    Hmmm I can try this one! Never even thought about it.   wear linen or cotton long sleeves   Never even thought of this! Will have to do some shopping. Thanks!"
Horses,3acw9d,thelurkess,2,Fri Jun 19 20:06:35 2015 UTC,"Hi hi! I'm glad it gave some ideas!   I really only do the ice cubes when I'm overheating, I'll find some shade and just sit for a minute. It's surprisingly helpful, and more discreet than it sounds ;) my mom used to force me to put them in at shows when I was melting down.  The peppermint oil is only a few drops so it's not sticky at all. But it's quite a bit like menthol, where you feel the cool sensation on your skin immediately. If the pure oil gets on our skin it will last for hours, so you can increase it if you need it. You can get them for just a few bucks on Amazon, pretty easy. :)  Yeah, with the cooling vest I'm thinking maybe you might try the little under hat/helmet one first. Much cheaper and you could test it that way.   Good luck out there! :) :)"
Horses,3acw9d,AuntieChiChi,2,Fri Jun 19 20:13:51 2015 UTC,"I am sensitive to the heat too and I live in Florida... Is so brutally hot right now, so I can understand!    Try the moisture wicking shirts, I find they help a bit, but I don't like them too tight.  Also, I bring my water-bottle-fan (filled with ice and water) in the arena with me while I ride.  Make sure the sound of the fan doesn't freak out your house though!  I spray/fan myself throughout my lesson or ride.  As soon as I am done riding, my helmet comes off and I pour a little bit of my ice water on my head.  When I hose off my horse I make sure to mist myself as well.. Mostly just the top of my head.  Lots and lots of water during the ride.  I ride really really early for my lessons (some time between 7 & 830) and for my personal rides I try to be on the horse either before 9 or after 7pm. It is just too hot otherwise.    And it sucks because summers are when I have all the time in the world to ride since I am a teacher the rest of the year."
Horses,3acw9d,AuntieChiChi,2,Mon Jun 22 19:12:54 2015 UTC,The oil in the water is the only one if these I have not tried.  That sounds like a lovely idea!!

Horses,3acswg,party_atthemoontower,3,Fri Jun 19 01:43:26 2015 UTC,Citronella definitely. I think it can be applied full strength out of reach of mouths.
Horses,3acswg,TheBostonLady,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:12:33 2015 UTC,Zonk It smells terrible and doesn't work. I like Toad Mist because it works and smells good. It list the ingredients but I would hate to mix it incorrectly. Do you use straight citronella or what is you ratio?
Horses,3acswg,TheBostonLady,3,Fri Jun 19 02:20:21 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure you can use citronella full strength in small doses. My friend uses it full strength by putting some on her hands then wiping the horse's face/legs/belly. A great fly spray is the pyrhana in the can. Good shit right there.
Horses,3acswg,Hypergraphiclane,2,Fri Jun 19 03:14:31 2015 UTC,"Don't know about essential oils... but I don't rub anything on my horses that I would not apply to my own skin. This is why I use good old fashioned Bag Balm. It runs about $9 for a large tin. Here in CO, black flies, mosquitoes, gnats and horseflies are common. I use a pair of old leather gloves to apply a good dollop to the chest/front legs, belly, sheath/inside of hind legs in the morning, then use a clean cloth to wipe down the dirt and excess goo at the day's end. Re-apply if necessary. It is great for wound care, too. It works exceedingly well, even for my thin-skinned mare. The horses like the smell of it, and the pests hate it! I'll even rub a little on if the flies decide they like me too! It does get sticky and it will grease stain your clothing, so don't wear anything too nice, but the same can be said about poisonous pesticides."
Horses,3acswg,fishwithfeet,4,Fri Jun 19 17:34:17 2015 UTC,"Just buy a natural fly spray if that's what you're going for. There's a ton on the market with active ingredients that are only oils. Don't buy into the scam that is essential oils.   Ultrashield Green Fly Repellent: Geranoil .7%, Clove Oil .08%, Citronella Oil .06%, Rosemary Oil .05%, Lemongrass Oil .05%, Cedar Oil .05%, Thyme Oil .01%"
Horses,3acswg,AtomicPenny,0,Fri Jun 19 02:58:49 2015 UTC,I just thought I could save some money making my own vs $20 for a spray bottle every week. 3 horses and one is very sensitive and gets welts and drippy eyes.
Horses,3acswg,chybaby7,3,Fri Jun 19 03:23:29 2015 UTC,"If you buy the gallon jugs of concentrate and refill spray bottles it's far cheaper than continually buying the smaller size. Bulk anything is usually more economical.   But the cheap diy is citronella, which you seemed opposed to in a different post, so I don't know what to tell you. We made our own a lot growing up with citronella and listerine..and then tried straight citronella. And then gave up and went store bought because the natural stuff doesn't even slow down the damn horse flies!! And those things hurt!  Have you tried feeding through garlic or similar?"
Horses,3acswg,AtomicPenny,2,Fri Jun 19 12:01:31 2015 UTC,"I know your looking for natural, but all the natural fly sprays I've seen say to apply every 4 hours. Which is something I don't have time for. My personal favorite is the Pyranha Wipe N' Spray. It last the longest and seems to do the job better than any other fly sprays I've tried. I had a mare the would get giant welts from the fly and the vet said she would probably need to be on steroids. This helped but didn't solve the problem."
Horses,3acswg,ImaCheeseMonkey,2,Fri Jun 19 03:43:19 2015 UTC,I love the Pyranha! The Bug Block (purple bottle) also works awesome.  My boy gets hives from gnats. He'd be screwed in the wild.
Horses,3acswg,phoxphyre,3,Fri Jun 19 12:09:47 2015 UTC,My boy gets hives from gnats.    Mine does too and he gets Diphenhydramine(Benadryl) and it really helps keep the bumps down.
Horses,3acswg,ImaCheeseMonkey,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:03:42 2015 UTC,"I am just starting to investigate allergies in my boy: how much Diphenhydramine do you use, and is it expensive?"
Horses,3acswg,hoofbeats,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:03:16 2015 UTC,Not expensive at all if you go to Walmart or Sams Club and get a big huge bottle. My barn owner gives 4 or 5 pills each day mixed in with grain. It seriously makes a huge difference this time of year.
Horses,3acswg,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:28:54 2015 UTC,My boy also got like baseball sized welts from the flies. Unfortunately it turned out I'm allergic to the pesticides in a lot of the heavy duty sprays so I'd douse him in citronella and use those fly zappers around the barn and hope for the best. Thankfully the flies weren't as bad there as other parts of the country.
Horses,3acswg,nefariousmango,2,Fri Jun 19 14:16:58 2015 UTC,Ditto on the Pyranha being the poison of choice.
Horses,3acswg,WishMaster1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:08:30 2015 UTC,"I came here to say the same thing.  Even with daily application I have never had a natural fly spray work nearly as well as the nasty chemical ones do.  We swear by Endure.  The real trick is to clean your horse thoroughly, then spray your horse, and then brush them backwards to get the spray down closer to the skin."

Horses,3aae7n,showmebevelle,20,Thu Jun 18 14:27:23 2015 UTC,She isn't your rival.  You are your rival.   You go into the show ring focusing on doing better than your last shows.    Showing is about assessing the improvement of your skills and your horses training as time goes on.  As far as her behavior: she's not a rival to anyone.  She's insecure and petty. I'd feel bad for her and not give her a second thought.
Horses,3aae7n,funchy,14,Thu Jun 18 15:45:53 2015 UTC,your...... rival? is this high school? I'm so glad I don't show.
Horses,3aae7n,bearxfoo,0,Thu Jun 18 14:55:52 2015 UTC,"It's childish and embarrassing, but whenever we go to the same show she spends a lot of time pointing and whispering behind her hands with her friends... It hurts, and for no explainable reason.  She's really competitive with me - even when we're not showing. Buy something? She's gotta have exactly the same."
Horses,3aae7n,bearxfoo,8,Thu Jun 18 15:01:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe you need to focus on other things instead of people. I don't want to be mean but, how old are you? Because I'm almost 30 and I couldn't even imagine beginning to even consider somebody as a ""rival"" - I have a mortgage, a job, a degree, two dogs, horses... I have bills, I can't be worried about some childish girl somewhere talking shit about me.   Redirect your attention. You're (I'm assuming) an adult. Not in high school with some petty rivalry."

Horses,3aae7n,carbonarbonoxide,3,Thu Jun 18 16:35:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have these things too. And the girl is much older than me - by five years. I am twenty two.  It's never bothered me before, I've always ridden for me. But as soon as I saw her entered I felt sick and am considering withdrawing.  I don't really have a problem with her... She has a nice horse, she rides well, but she pointed and laughed at my jump round this Sunday just gone and I've never been so embarrassed."
Horses,3aae7n,silver_slinky,8,Thu Jun 18 15:21:37 2015 UTC,"Don't waste your time on people who are ugly to other people just for the sake of it. Rivalries are for children, and even though she's older, she clearly thinks it's okay to act like she is younger. Maybe she has something going on internally that she needs to do that to feel better about herself. Plain don't acknowledge it- she will get bored eventually. Focus on riding better, and enjoying what you are doing FOR FUN as an adult with limited free time."
Horses,3aae7n,missbeeeem,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:30:02 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add, I come from a very nasty circle of showing. I quit western pleasure initially because my trainer would gossip with her friends - not just about people's riding, but about their lives. Beat my trainer at a show? She's a lying, thieving, w#*@$, who deserves to die.   I didn't want to be around people like that so I just stopped. It gets very, very nasty. These are people who will run your name into the mud every second they get, so much so that I know other women who can't get farriers, dentists, occasionally VETS, because people have bullied them out of the 'in' circle.  We just purchased property 30km out of town so we don't have to deal with it. It's making me a nervous wreck.   One of my trainer's was an RSPCA inspector, when we fell out because I didn't want to buy her quarter horse that she was pressuring me into, she started doing random health checks on my pets, once letting herself into my house and then writing me a fine 'coz my cats food bowl was empty...  Oh, and once, she shut down an entire vet facility for three weeks because one unused turn out paddock didn't have shade... because this lady told someone she didn't like the QH stallion the inspector was showing.  People have had manes cut off, tails hacked, once someone ran a clipper blade through a horses coat randomly, yards opened at shows, tyres slashed, hay stolen, shoes ripped off, rugs cut up.  It gets crazy. I'm not scared for no reason!"
Horses,3aae7n,breannabalaam,4,Fri Jun 19 02:25:17 2015 UTC,That's completely absurd. It sounds like all of those people are crazy. Maybe you really should consider not showing in that environment it really does not seem like much fun.
Horses,3aae7n,raychul78,2,Fri Jun 19 02:54:09 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I'm isolated by about 300km. As soon as we can venture further down south to compete, we will!"
Horses,3aae7n,hoofbeats,4,Fri Jun 19 03:43:11 2015 UTC,"In my experience, the key to success in the show ring (defining success as having a good time and doing what you love) is to focus on yourself and yourself alone. Showing is hard on you and your horse, and if you are worrying about things outside of your bubble, you're just going to make things that much more difficult. I'm an extremely competitive person, and anytime I tried to ride to beat someone, it invariably did not go well. (Secretly I think my horse knows I'm just trying to beat someone and he responds by giving me a humbling ride, thus forcing me to refocus). Focus on you. Ride better than you did yesterday, because ultimately, that's the only thing you can do. Your rival could have the ride of their life. The judge could just plain not notice you. You could have the ride of your life. In the show pen, there are only so many variables you can control, so why not focus on those, and keep yourself and your horse happy? Because that's why we do this isn't it? To have fun and be happy! Best of luck, I know it's easier said than done."

Shovel your damn roof - problem solved, death avoided. I'm still torn up about a few horses that were lost in my area due to that negligence.  Thankfully planning for severe weather isn't too bad where I am.  -We keep extra hay in case the following year only allows for one cut due to drought or too much rain.  -Barns are placed high and all pastures have serious ditching and french drains to allow for winter melt and spring rains and any associated flooding (mud season is a legit 5th season).  -Temps can be well below zero for extended periods, snow loads can be crazy - we shovel roofs, close up barns, blanket as necessary, and plan for getting water to them in case pipes freeze.  -We get random high winds from the errant hurricanes moving up the coast, nor'easters, and the fluke tornado. Keep an eye on tree growth around barns, trailers, etc and things are all right there.  -Summers can be over 100 and humid for lengths at a time. Good well and great ground water up here so I could fill a darn swimming pool for the horses even in a drought if I wanted. Shady areas, breeze, water, good to go.  As far as natural disasters and horses are concerned the one that seems the scariest to me by a long shot is tornadoes. Anyone here in tornado alley that can weigh in on that? I have seen images that people build concrete storm shelters for their horses...is that common in barns in those areas? Should you turn a horse out and take chances with debris or do you bring them in and hope the barn isn't in the path?"
Horses,3a6rv7,AtomicPenny,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:04:45 2015 UTC,"When I had my horse we worried about fires all the time! He even got evacuated once and then evacuated from that place to another. Thankfully my instructor lived at the barn and guarteened I had a spot in her trailer. That was the worst, there were often more horses than trailer room. Thankfully our whole barn survived."

And, I'm not half bad apparently (so my trainer says).  Now, if I could only learn to canter better, lol.  ;)"

Horses,3a6dsa,carefreeams,3,Wed Jun 17 16:12:02 2015 UTC,"Did you treat the wood? It's a bit of a pain in the ass to paint/stain every year or two, but it gives you much more protection against rotting and cracking and longevity. Did you install pressure treated or cedar, or plain untreated pine?  I'm in the northeast US, not all that far from the border, and the seasonal extremes definitely wreak havoc. Wood or skipping substantial fencing entirely and going with hot tape are the two that seem to age the best in my opinion in these climates (again, assuming they're being maintained properly). Wood is obviously a much more aesthetically pleasing option, but will have a bigger time investment to keep up on.  If you're turning out in there or the paddock shares the fence a strand of electric wire along the top is the best way to keep a horse's mouth off of it. If they're going to chew and play with a fence they will do it with any type of fence. Flex rail will not be immune to their chewing. There are a billion commercial and DIY versions of chew stop products out there, I've never found one that worked for any length of time. Electricity is all the jerks understand haha  I personally am not a fan of RAMM and other flex fencing options. I have never seen one that didn't look like complete shit after 6 months. They bend, warp, stretch, and look like drunken waves.  The PVC ""board"" fencing looks beautiful. But it's expensive, and I've seen some awful injuries with it becoming brittle and horses getting shards of it in them. However, if it's only being used in a riding ring situation and not for turnout and all the daily wear and tear that fencing is subjected to I would happily install a bunch of it.  No fence is going to last forever, but properly maintained wood should last at least 25+ years."
Horses,3a6dsa,AtomicPenny,3,Wed Jun 17 16:27:27 2015 UTC,"I've been at barns with the PVC boards for arenas and they definitely look beautiful. I agree that I wouldn't want to house a horse in them 24/7, but for an arena it held up really well. Daily use with multiple trainers & horses, we would only very occasionally break one of the boards due to something like an errant kick. Like you said, they do break into sharp bits when they break, but they do stand up to a lot of abuse and the boards are easily replaceable."
Horses,3a6dsa,shh_im_not_here,2,Wed Jun 17 18:20:12 2015 UTC,Is metal fencing not done in most parts of the country? When I rode in southern California every single barn used metal piping except for the occasional arena. Now that I'm out of that area I haven't seen it much at all. I guess I'm just curious
Horses,3a6dsa,hoofbeats,3,Wed Jun 17 17:16:38 2015 UTC,Metal panels for round pens or gates are common. I have never seen piping used for a whole ring or pasture up here.
Horses,3a6dsa,AtomicPenny,2,Wed Jun 17 17:24:16 2015 UTC,The whole structure of barns in southern California was weird. Instead of barns and pastures we had outdoor metal stalls with overheads to provide shelter
Horses,3a6dsa,hoofbeats,3,Wed Jun 17 17:27:14 2015 UTC,I've never seen it outside of AZ and CA. I should think it's very expensive and probably not great in wet/ humid areas due to rust.
Horses,3a6dsa,ellevt,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:51:48 2015 UTC,I thought it was odd when I moved to AZ but it seems pretty commonplace here.
Horses,3a6dsa,NeverendingStarchild,2,Tue Jun 30 22:37:51 2015 UTC,The next fence I am buying is the Centaur fence hands down. I love their stuff. It come with a warranty as well. Cleaning power washing or bleach spray depending on the climate.
Horses,3a6dsa,notantisocial,2,Wed Jun 17 17:05:15 2015 UTC,"Check out something called horserail, they make an electrified version called hottop too.  It's high tensile wire, but it looks like PVC from anything further than a few feet away."

I especially like them because they talk about horses in general, riding, and taking care of your horse in equal amounts.   The D-Level book would be a good start right now if your daughter is an advanced reader, or if you don't mind reading it to her and explaining things. Otherwise, you may wish to hold off a year or two with it because it is a kind of serious book with no colored illustrations (line drawings only) and it's pretty wordy."

Ann Arbor is the closet major city @ 10/15 minutes away, although I'm pretty much in between many large cities, including A2, Belleville, Saline, Milan, Dexter, Chelsea, Canton, Wayne.... etc, those are all close by 20/30 minutes tops.   Yes, I work for a hospital, so it requires at least being near a hospital  I own 2 horses  I board them both  I don't keep them on land but land is very abundant here and it is not difficult to have it correctly zoned for horse ownership  I board 20 minutes away from my house, I use to be closer @ 10 minutes but I recently moved  Full care, $275/month  Where I board at is extremely horse friendly  There is a good healthy mix of boarding and private ownership  I love Michigan, I wouldn't change anything (except our cold winters, ha)  Michigan is extremely horse centered state. We have some amazing trails, tons of shows, tons of barns, boarding, lessons.. I mean, I don't know how other states are, but I consider myself lucky to be here. Also, we have Michigan State University. MSU is probably one of the best veterinary schools in the nation and is a leading school for equine health and management. People travel from all over the nation to bring their horses to MSU when they have medical emergencies and problems. I live about an hour and a half from State and it's a simple drive, so I feel lucky to have that.   Also, non-equine related, we also have U of M which is an not only an amazing school but a top notch teaching hospital.   Michigan ftw."
Horses,3a0uj5,bearxfoo,3,Tue Jun 16 12:23:39 2015 UTC,"Gonna add on my Michigan comment, but on the other side of the state.   My girlfriends parents live in south west Michigan.  Closest city - Kalamazoo, about 45 minutes. Second Closest City - Grand Rapids, about hour and 45 minutes.  Her parents are retired, but our occupations will require us to be nearish to cities (engineer and pharmacist). End goal is to eventually build a house near her parents farm.   Her parents have 11-12 horses. They are kept on their own property. I am not sure of the amount of land they have, but its acres. Enough for small, single horse turnouts, a large multi-horse turn out, like 6/7 barns, alfalfa field, another field they rent out to a farmer. Its not difficult at all, because they live in a very farm heavy part of town.  Three of their horses are boarded elsewhere for training. Two a few hours south, and one in Kalamazoo with my trainer.  The town is very horse friendly. There are a lot of amish people living in the area, as well as other cow/horse/chicken/goat/pig people.  It is absolutely beautiful out on their farm. One of my favorite places in the world. Yes, its a drive to everything, and it took me, a Detroit native, a bit of time to adjust, but the peace and tranquility is amazing.  Michigan is a very good area to have horses, imo. Lots of good trainers, lots of open and quarter horse shows all over the state. Lots of state parks that have horse trails. We have 4/5 great lakes as well, and probably the best damn beer you will ever drink."

In a school/boarding stable owned by my friend and trainer, currently 30 horses in the stable Less than a miles. I moved in that particular apartment to be close to my horse. I usually go to the stable twice a day.  Full care but I'm a part-time trainer and groom so I do much of it myself. And I like it better done my way anyway. 375 CAN$, horses fed twice daily, including hay and pellets. Stalls are cleaned daily. One arena, one huge outside track, no fields to let the horse free (land is expensive), minimal trails. No, it's not horse friendly. No trails, roads are too dangerous to use (people around here are not used to horses on the roads and will basically push you off the road), a few good stables around, decent regional and provincial show system in place.  Mostly boarding facilities, land is expensive and there isn't many legal place to keep horses since we are so close to a city.  Like : amazing city, lots to do and see (it's a well known touristic city). Hate : 6 month of freezing crappy snowy winter and riding at 30 C below 0.    Relevant : The Montreal's Olympics facility is relatively near my place and I get to compete there every summer. Beautiful set up and facility. Amazing footing.  Somewhat relevent : Quebec is mostly a French speaking province so we are isolated from other provinces/states and have somehow different associations and systems, making it hard to travel and compete elsewhere.

Horses,3a0uj5,Murlau,3,Tue Jun 16 17:23:56 2015 UTC,"Wisconsin  Madison - 35 minutes from the barn where I board  Yes, I work at a large company in the city.  1 horse  Board - Pasture is $220/month, Full care is $350/month  There are definitely some good horse people and instructors in the area, even if some of them don't advertise as well. Madison is a wonderful place because you can be 20 minutes outside the city and be surrounded by farms. When I'm driving around, I see a lot more horses than I'd expect!  I always wish there was more dressage people in the area, but then again, I spent the winter in Wellington so I got a bit spoiled. ;) I have to say, after being down there versus up here, I can't imagine a better place to have horses than the Midwest. Our hay is cheap ($3-5/bale for some great quality hay), we have plenty of land for turnout, and while I might not appreciate it, the temperate climate is a lot easier on the horses compared to Florida. We have some good instructors in the area, three dressage showgrounds within 2.5 hours, and Midwest Horse Fair every year.   Plus, despite what those Michigan people say, Wisconsin has the best beer ever. And cheese. Not to mention the beautiful landscape. There's a little of everything - some bluffs and beautiful rock formations on the west side of the state, lots of lakes, gorgeous forests in the north, some nice beaches along Lake Michigan, and prairie."
Horses,3a0uj5,sarzipan,3,Wed Jun 17 00:22:39 2015 UTC,"What state do you live in?     Georgia   What is the closest major city (minutes/miles)?     Atlanta (about an hour north)     Does your profession require you to be near a city?     Sorta. I'm an engineering student, so though there are jobs all over, all the ones I'm interested in are in cities.     How many horses do you have?     One     Do you board or keep them on your own property?     I board.     If you keep your horse(s) on your property, how much land do you have, and is it difficult to find properties zoned for horses where you live?     There are tons of agricultural zoned properties near my house. Unless you go to a neighborhood, I almost think it would be harder to find a plain ol' residential zoned lot.     If you board, how far is the facility from your home?     About a minute drive (1 mile away). I feel so spoiled with how convenient it is.     Is it full care or self care?     Full care. Two feedings a day and turnout, but no riding or training provided by the barn.     How much do you pay to board?     $530/month     Do you consider your town/city to be horse friendly?     Very much so. This town prides itself on being horse country. There's horses and tack stores literally everywhere, as well as a huge equestrian center. Hell, there's even pictures of horses on the police cars.     Do many people keep horses on their own property near you, or do most use boarding facilities?     I'd say it's 50/50. As you get closer to the downtown areas, there's more boarding stables, but as you head toward the country, everybody and their dog has land with horses.     What do you like best about where you live, and what would you change if you could?     I love how horse friendly it is. It's also super fancy in certain parts of town and there are some seriously nice barns. Unfortunately, there are a lot of stuck up snooty people who I really don't want to deal with. However, they tend to hang out around the show rings and I don't show very often.     Any other relevant information? Or irrelevant, for that matter?     I feel like I'm in a somewhat similar situation. I'm still in college, but I'm going to graduate in a year. The company I work for is moving their offices around the Atlanta area and I have no idea which one I'll end up at. Since I'm very likely to work for them once I graduate, it's really difficult to plan where to keep my horse and where I should live. I'm so used to being close to the barn that I can't imagine being more than ten minutes away, but at the same time, I can't stand a long commute. I'll have some tough decisions to make in the upcoming year."
Horses,3a0uj5,chickenfriedswag,2,Wed Jun 17 00:46:28 2015 UTC,"What state do you live in?  Indiana  What is the closest major city (minutes/miles)?  Indianapolis 20-30 minutes depending on what part of the city you're visiting.  Does your profession require you to be near a city?  No.  How many horses do you have? 3  Do you board or keep them on your own property?  We own our property, but have boarded in the last 2 years.  If you keep your horse(s) on your property, how much land do you have, and is it difficult to find properties zoned for horses where you live?   We have just under 5 acres, 20 stalls and an indoor arena.    If you board, how far is the facility from your home?  There is a decent boarding facility less than 5 minutes from our house and a really nice one about 10 minutes away.  Is it full care or self care?  The first barn is mostly pasture board, but they'll supplement, grain and stall your horse in bad weather at no extra cost.  The nicer facility is full care and includes blanketing, turn out, grain, supplements, but also requires you to take at least one lesson per week.  How much do you pay to board? (feel free not to answer this one if you would prefer)  Barn 1 was $300/mo for one horse $275/mo if you boarded 2 or more.  Barn 2 is $500/mo.  Do you consider your town/city to be horse friendly? Yes  Do many people keep horses on their own property near you, or do most use boarding facilities?  There are actually tons of both.  The neighbor to the left of us has a horse, there is a house behind us with horse facilities but no horses and a few houses down the people have at least two.  What do you like best about where you live, and what would you change if you could? (this does not have to be horse related)  The people here are really friendly and it's far enough away from the city that you still get the rural feel, but close enough that driving down there on a weeknight isn't an inconvenience. If I could change anything I would have a few more acres of land and not live on such a busy road.      Any other relevant information? Or irrelevant, for that matter?  There's a great mix of disciplines here and it's incredibly easy to find a facility that fits your needs.  I have friends  who do everything from mounted shooting to 4th level dressage."

I have 2, but there are 6 between everyone in my family and it's kind of a group effort.  We lease a whole barn with pasture, and we have one boarder. I don't keep horses on my property anymore because I only have an acre. It's not really hard to find horse property in my area (we actually have more horses per person here than anywhere in the state) but I see this changing in the future because of development.  About a 10 minute drive away. Completely self care.  The whole facility is $450/month.  I would say my town is very horse friendly.  I'd say it's pretty much half and half, there's lots of acreage available but many people have to board anyways to get out of the rain.  I don't really dislike where I live, but I get really tired of the rain in the winter."

On my property, were boarded until last month.   If you keep your horse(s) on your property, how much land do you have, and is it difficult to find properties zoned for horses where you live? About 5 acres. And it depends on where you are in the town.   If you board, how far is the facility from your home? It was 10 miles  Is it full care or self care? They offered both, but I used partial board.   How much do you pay to board? I paid $225/horse for partial care, full board was $625  Do you consider your town/city to be horse friendly? Not really, but there are some that are close that would be considered so.   Do many people keep horses on their own property near you, or do most use boarding facilities? Most folks use boarding facilities, though there are ""pockets"" of houses that have land and horses. (I now live in one :) )  What do you like best about where you live, and what would you change if you could? I love that you can ride all year round down here. It does get hot in the summer, but you can ride in the morning or evening and all winter long.   Any other relevant information? Or irrelevant, for that matter? Vet care is particularly expensive down here. I spend about $500 annually on each horses shots, teeth floating, coggins, and general health assessment."

If you want plays or comedy/arts go to Akron or Cleveland (1 hr) or Columbus (1.5 hours).  Not if I work remotely but I drive to work.  4 horses total  It is my mom's property so board them I guess.  There are 25 acres and no there are lots of properties zoned for horses and many have barns/pastures set up already for sale. Usually due to divorce  If I boarded the closest facility would be 5 minutes away, the next closest would be 7 minutes away, but if they were not open I could easily find something within 20.  Full care (not many self care around me that I know of) would be 300-325 for average places with an arena/stalled and outside for half a day. It would be double that for anything fancy like Chagrin (800 maybe).  My town is very horse friendly, you drive down my road alone and there is a horse in the pasture every mile! There are lots of disciplines too, but I only do dressage/trail riding. I have jumped with some trainers before too. Lots of western, some backyard western ""trainers"" and some respectable.  It seems like most people keep their horses on their own property near me, but many people from Akron and Cleveland keep their horses at boarding facilities. Most people around me group up and go trail riding at lots of local parks  Best part of where I live is that it is quiet and smells beautiful outside compared to the cities. Also housing is pretty cheap, especially if you buy a house. Snow is peoples biggest complaint, but I think the worst part is the humidity in the summers. Been a hot one the past couple years! Southern Ohio like Cincinnati does not get snow much at all, if that is your thing. I do not think even Columbus gets snow all that much either, HUGE horse culture there, that is where lots of regional breed shows are located, or things like Equine Affair!  I would highly recommend Columbus but I have never lived there"
Horses,3a0uj5,UniquePlainJane,2,Tue Jun 16 16:27:50 2015 UTC,"Florida I'm in Tallahassee. Jacksonville is only 2.5 hours, Atlanta is 4, Orlando I think is 5. Not exactly. I just graduated FSU Law and am prepping for the bar.  More law jobs are available in larger cities, but I've managed to find a job (thank goodness!!) in a suburban/rural-ish area only 20 minutes from Mobile, AL.  Just one :) I board. The facility is only 20 minutes from my house, and 15 minutes from downtown where I was studying and working.  Full care, pasture board. Sometimes I have to be present for the farrier or vet though.  $250, but that doesn't include feed, hay, supplements, vaccinations, or wormers.  Very!! There are a variety of affordable barns in this area, some with very talented instructors from across all disciplines.  Rick Wallace, Elisa Wallace's father, is located about 40 minutes east of Tallahassee.  Some great clinicians roll through. There are a great variety of trails.  Several barns have fabulous cross country courses.  Oh, and did I mention Red Hills International Horse Trials is hosted here every March? We have a great horse rescue, and we're not too far from Ocala. Several places for barrel racing as well, but I've never been out to watch them.  It's probably a 50/50 mix.  Tallahassee has a lot going on... we're the center for Florida government, we have the school close by, and tons of fun events going on. The City is growing and developing, and just built a new amphitheater that's hosted some famous musicians. Lots of great restaurants and shopping.  I also like the political diversity. But if you drive just 20-30 minutes outside of the city, you're in the Florida wildlife. There's something for everyone here... great parks for outdoors enthusiasts, a artsy/hipstereqsue area in Railroad Square, a more high-end/preppy area in midtown, lots of suburbia. I wish we were closer to the beach though. It takes about 2 hours to get to a good one. Our drivers are slow. The heat and humidity are a pain, but I find it manageable before 10 am and after 7 pm when summer's at its peak. This does mean that winter is manageable though!  I wish I could stay here longer!"

The facilities are much nicer than I could ever have on my own land, and it's social. The barn is 15 minutes away from my house. Most of the horses are full care stall board, which I think runs close to $800 per month (not sure on that exactly) and it involves EVERYTHING--feeding 2 or 3x a day, blanketing, holding for vet/farrier, etc. I choose to do field board because it's cheaper, plus my pony likes living outside. $300 per month. I think the going rate is actually more than this, but I'm friends with the owners and me/my pony are VERY low maintenance so we work things out. Yes, I live in a very horsey area, mostly english but some western too I have lots of friends who keep horses on their own property, and I also know a lot of people who board. There are lots of choices near where I live The humidity, haha. Honestly though, I like it in MD I don't think so?"

Technically I am closer to Cookeville but it isn't as major of a city.  Does your profession require you to be near a city? No but I am not a professional. I have a part time job to pay for my horses and stuff they need or I need as well as teaching some riding lessons.  How many horses do you have?  I have two full size and two miniature horses.  Do you board or keep them on your own property?  I keep them on my property.   If you keep your horse(s) on your property, how much land do you have, and is it difficult to find properties zoned for horses where you live? I have 17 acres. Only about 10 or so is fenced for the horses though. The rest is wooded, or fenced off because of barns or other animals, and my dad wanted a driving range for golf so had to fence that off for him too. Lol. I live out in the Country so land is very abundant here. It's just finding places that aren't completely covered in timberland or rocks that is hard.

Horse friendly, kind of.... English riding friendly, not really.  Do many people keep horses on their own property near you, or do most use boarding facilities? Most keep them on their own property but I know of a few boarding barns.  What do you like best about where you live, and what would you change if you could?

Sometimes I am just so tired after work that I am dragging my feet to go out there... so it'd be nice to know they are getting fed at the same time every day.  But at the same time I'd love to be a billionaire and own my own boarding and training facility and hire staff and just manage it all, make it all work like clock work lol. Polar opposites I know.."

My family owns a farm/ranch.  The horses currently have about 10 acres.  I live about 75 miles from the farm.  At the farm if you are coming down our road you are coming to our house. But if I am road riding most people know me or are still very respectful of my animals.  We are the only horse owners for about 30 miles in either direction. I wish I lived closer to home. It is a very quiet area and it would be nice to have a neighbor a mile and a half away instead of a few feet. I often miss the community of riding with other people but I enjoy being able to get out and ride without any noise or distractions. Plus the horses all have a job of working with cattle so they do get a break from certain routines."

If you board, how far is the facility from your home? ~30 minutes away. Is it full care or self care? Full care - including feed, turnout, one lesson a week, indoor board with box stall, etc. How much do you pay to board? I pay $465 a month for half board, however I also have a half leaser for my horse who also pays half board. I also pay an additional $140 a month for an extra lesson each week. That doesn't include vet and farrier bills (I think it's $300 annual for vet bills, and $130 every month and a half for farrier), and show costs (which are up there at about $400/day, not including misc expenses, and showing ~twice a month from May to September).

We have our THJA provincial show circuit, ""developer series"" shows for schooling, plus A-shows in Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, etc. However, there really aren't a lot of western riders or shows here (or at least that I know of). It's really mostly a Hunter/Jumper scene, and some dressage. Trails and roads sort of possible, but really everyone stays on property. It's more of a competition area here, less trails or working horses (farm work, ranch work, etc). But we do have a lot of top-notch facilities for A-shows and championships, like Wesley Clover, Caledon/Palgrave, Bromont, etc. that you can travel to. Do many people keep horses on their own property near you, or do most use boarding facilities? Boarding facilities - although the barn owners usually own most of the horses, and riders full or half lease for the year to compete on the horse. What do you like best about where you live, and what would you change if you could? It's too cold. Riding in -40 degrees for a good part of the year is not fun. As well, from about November to April you have to ride in an indoor ring, since you'll have a few feet of snow and ice at any given time, and it's just not safe to ride outside during the winter here.

My profession did require being near a city (microbiologist). I had 1 horse while in WA that I boarded. At first the facility was about 15 miles away, 30 min drive, then 10 miles away 20 min drive, then 10 miles the other direction 15 min drive.  Facility one was a partial self care for 325/month (I provided hay/grain, stall cleaning and turn in) with indoor/outdoor, stall with run and directly on a pipeline trail, second facility was 375/month full care, minimal amenities, outdoor only but TONS of pasture board, never ran out of grass in the pasture, had trails on site and was a 1 mile walk from a local park with equestrian trails. Third was indoor arena only but great pasture board for 450/month full care, GREAT atmosphere and trainers.  I lived in a very horse friendly area.     I moved to Michigan for my husband's new job. Closest major city is probably Flint, Detroit is second I'm not sure on miles yet. I have not yet found a job, currently I'm a stay at home mom. I still have 1 horse, I'm about to acquire 2 donkeys. We own our own property now, 5 acres already set up for horses with an outdoor sand ring. It was NOT difficult to find properties where horses could be kept, we had a few places to choose from while house hunting. We found quite a bit and the area is extremely horse friendly. It seems like most people keep their horses at home, or will board in the winter only for amenities like an indoor arena.   I would change new place to be transplanted back to Washington with the MI cost of living.... but WA trail systems.  Damn I miss WA right now."

I'm going to school to be an automotive tech, but I'm also in the insurance business. How many horses do you have?  -Two. A mare and a gelding.

If you keep your horse(s) on your property, how much land do you have, and is it difficult to find properties zoned for horses where you live? -I currently live on two acres, but am not allowed to have my horses on my land because I live in the city limits.

As long as you live in the county, and not within city limits, you can have pretty much whatever you want.

Do you consider your town/city to be horse friendly?  -It is, but isn't. There are quite a few horse people around, but it's hard to get in with the right people, if that makes sense. Do many people keep horses on their own property near you, or do most use boarding facilities? -It's about 50/50. If the people can keep their horses on their own property, they will. Otherwise, they have to board them. What do you like best about where you live, and what would you change if you could? (this does not have to be horse related) -Northeast Tennessee is gorgeous. The only bad thing about my town is the chemical plant that's smack dab in the middle of it. There is a LOT of land and farms for sale close to the Virginia line, as well as out towards Bristol. If I were able to keep my horses on my personal property, I would, but unless we were a farm that was already established before they threw in the ""no livestock in the city"" law, then we can't have any livestock, or ""farm animal"". Which is ridiculous, because they don't even enforce it with chickens, pigs, rabbits, etc... But if I had one horse, or one cow, all hell would break loose... Any other relevant information? Or irrelevant, for that matter? -You may also want to check out Southeast Kentucky. I lived there for the first bit of my life, and loved it. It's VERY horse friendly, and the people there are amazing."

No, it's not difficult to find homes with acreage that's already fenced or cross-fenced or has a barn in areas like Semmes, Wilmer, and Theodore (they're like their own little towns with shopping/grocery/etc available, but they're all about 20-30 minute drive down interstate or highway to DOWNTOWN).   I live three miles from downtown, and it takes me about 20 minutes on the interstate to get to the barn. My mom lives suburbia and it only takes her about 15.  I'm at a full service barn (includes senior pellets 2x day, hay, stall cleaning, turnout, blanket service). It's $375/mo and I pay $30 for supplements every 5 weeks, $40 for farrier every 4-6 weeks, and wormer is ~$10 quarterly (we do fecal examinations to determine that). We have three barns, an air conditioned tack room w/restroom, one lit area, one regular arena, two round pens, a show quality obstacle course, and miles of trails around three lakes.  Yes. We have facilities that are on national show circuits, and have a lovely county-owned covered arena for shows.  We have riders of all disciplines - everything from cart drivers (or whatever it's called), to timed events, to endurance, to three day eventers, and we even have a facility that trains racehorses.  Because Mobile is a big city plopped down in the woods, we have plenty of both.  I can name maybe a dozen full service boarding facilities off the top of my head, not counting over in Baldwin County, but I also know a bunch of people who keep their horses at home.  What do I like best about where I live? Have you ever seen our beaches? Or our beautiful historical areas? Did you know that Mobile was celebrating Mardi Gras before New Orleans was founded, and is way safer and more family friendly than the one in New Orleans? Did you know when they're in season, there's a free crawlfish boil somewhere in town at least three days a week?  On the down side: the humidity. If you're from a really dry climate, this is something you'll probably never get used to or learn to dress for. We also don't get snow much (I'm in my early 30s, and I've seen it stick to the ground maybe half a dozen times), and when we do, the entire city shuts down (because we don't have salt trucks or snow plows), and there's always a chance of another big hurricane. (Mobile hasn't been devastated by one since Frederick in the 1970s).  Best of luck! If you have any non-horsey questions about Mobile, check out /r/MobileAL"

Horses,39xflz,spinnereate,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:07:35 2015 UTC,Coyotes are crazy around where I live and there are these two wild dogs ( at least we think they're wild) I just got lucky that my horse was basically raised around guns so it doesn't bother him. But steel bb guns are a great alternative. Barely any noise and will still scare a lot of things off if you're a good shot. Or just tie a baseball bat behind your saddle.
Horses,39y1kl,FrancaisYorkMorgan,5,Mon Jun 15 18:50:20 2015 UTC,"Treat wild horses like you would treat wild dogs. Don't feed them or try to pet them, just give them a wide berth while keeping an eye on them. Some wild ponies are accustomed to people enough that they will try to approach you for food (dangerous because they can get nasty, if they do, wave your arms and make a loud noise to shoo them off). I would NEVER try to startle a herd of horses, because they outnumber you and you can't always predict which way they'll run. Only attempt to shoo away horses when there's only 1 or 2.  The safest choice is to go around them. NEVER walk through a herd of unfamiliar horses. Even though horses are flight animals, you never know if there's a stallion in the group or a boss mare that might just decide to fight back."
Horses,39y1kl,zerachechiel,6,Mon Jun 15 22:59:43 2015 UTC,"I would never, ever, ever walk through a herd of feral or semi-feral horses. I wouldn't even walk through a herd of horses at my barn. Horses are fast and dangerous - one can turn to kick you faster than you can even process whats happening. A kind of ""rule"" for horses is never have their backs turned to you, especially within kicking distance. A horse could ""kick"" out at another horse and hit you in the process, even if they aren't being directly malicious towards you.   If I were walking down a path and IN FRONT of me was a herd of feral horses, I'd make a loud noise to send them running, away from me. Horses spook easily, especially a feral horse, and they'll run away from the perceived danger. Getting close to a feral herd is extremely dangerous. Anything can be the ""danger"": a branch cracking, a plastic bag flapping - anything like that can spook a herd and send them off, away from you and you don't have to be close to achieve that. Probably your safest bet to get them off the path and away from you."

Horses,39xzf9,EventingJunkie,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:35:46 2015 UTC,"I'm really not big into critiquing but one thing really stood out to me watching your video.   I think overall you're both fairly effective but I feel like you almost have a ""no release"" release. I don't notice your hands moving forward, down, back, up or really anything. Though I do have to say, you're not pulling on his face and you seem to have independent hands, which is really good. I feel like you're trying to have an automatic style release but to really do that you'd have to move your hands several inches lower, so your line is straighter from bit to elbow and it will allow him to use his neck more effectively.   I know you are an eventer from your username, but a good look at good old George Morris in his prime is a great example of what I'd rather see from an automatic release.   I think pace and tempo was great for eventing show jumping. Swift but effective, didn't let you get ahead of yourself. I thought 90% of your distances worked as well, you had that one awkward jump in the middle but other than that it was a smooth course! Keep it up :)"

Horses,39xzf9,ZzShorty,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:57:11 2015 UTC,"Distances are ALWAYS hard to master. I'm still working on them and I rode schoolies for years who could find a spot to anything and everything by just pointing them. Just work on developing your eye. There is no shame in a lesson calling out 3, 2, 1, jump as you approach a fence. It really helps give you a realistic idea of where you might end up putting yourself once you get the hang of it.  As for the release, I do agree with what the other poster said, going with a good crest release would do you both wonders. You would be able to stay deeper and he can stretch forward. I would work on that before working on the automatic style I am describing.  Best of luck! I do think you two make a great pair, and will really shine with some polish! :)"
Horses,39xzf9,altf4life,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:33:10 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see a lot more weight in your heel. Your knee is pinching, causing your leg to swing quite and bit and your support base is off.   I think this is causing the lack of release- you don't have the security to be able to release fully over fences.   Practicing a half/galloping seat in the canter, lots of two point in the trot and no stirrup work will strengthen your legs.  Provided your horse doesn't dirty stop/run out- tie a ribbon halfway up his mane and grab onto that a stride out from the fence. This will help you get used to the idea of moving your hand over the fence. You can work up to an automatic release when your support base get stronger. The lack of release is causing your horse to jump hollowly- with his head up and back sunken. Lots of bounces and grids with big releases will help him develop a better bascule and jumping form.   edit- especially seeing the way he wants to stretch out when you go into the trot, I really think a bigger release will improve his jumping form. You're holding him too ""up"" over the fence and he can't use his neck effectively."
Horses,39xzf9,altf4life,2,Mon Jun 15 20:11:28 2015 UTC,"I will work on getting a good crest release down, and do two-point and half seat sets!  I think riding horses that were likely to refuse over the years has given me a tendency to be shorter in the release. I will work on getting that good, big release. Thanks for your input!"
Horses,39xzf9,hundredacrefield,2,Mon Jun 15 21:09:24 2015 UTC,"Ah yes- the learned defensive riding. It happens, but if you trust your horse you can work to create a better ride.   Check out this video of McLain Ward (or really any video of him riding). He has the best equitation in the big jumper ring. You can see him change his releases a lot through the video- he does a mix of crest releases and auto releases. His seat/legs are also perfect.   https://youtu.be/nWizU8qrEJE"
Horses,39xzf9,hundredacrefield,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:37:47 2015 UTC,"I like the comments posted so far :)  You have consistent rhythm for the most part, and your horse definitely knows his job. He is limited in his movement due to your short release, as already mentioned, but this is a fairly easy fix.  The harder fix will be learning not to depend on your knees as a base of support, and learning to use your hip and calf properly. Flat work flat work f flat work! With a coach. 2-point at walk/trot until you can do it for half an hour - CORRECTLY. Practice with no stirrups, work on your half seat at canter, using your full corner to circle at canter, etc. Etc. I think it's more a muscling problem on your behalf than lack of skills or knowledge. You just need to correct your position, build the muscle memory, and keep practicing. You grasp the whys, just need a set of eyes on the ground with experience and constructive advice and exercises.  You are pumping with your seat a bit as well, which interferes with his natural movement. Gridwork over trot poles, progressing to canter poles, then slowly adding small fences, will help you practice waiting for your fence and letting your horse's motion close your hip into 2-point, rather than throwing your weight onto his front end right before he takes off. Once your muscling muscling/leg position/seat improve, you will probably find it easier to keep the horse moving off your leg, rather than having to pump with your seat to feel like you're maintaining speed/rhythm. A bit quieter riding all around would make a lot nicer picture, and your beautiful boy and the fact that you fit him well already make a great picture imo.   Good luck, looks like you guys are a great team in the making, and being so open and accepting of critiques is the sign of a true student :) kudos!  Edit: watched again and you actually don't tend to throw your weight forward before the fence, you are just tipped a bit forward throughout the entire course because of the knee/support base issue. Guess I should have watched twice before critiquing."
Horses,39xzf9,mrflossin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:16:58 2015 UTC,"Noted! I will hit the gym. That's the thing about sports, you have to be fit to do them well. I guess I just didn't realize that was my real issue, and I think my coach is a little too nice to straight up tell me to lose weight and hit the gym. Reality is that way though. I'll make sure to take a few days each week to work on pole work and keeping my balance perfect without worrying out him like I usually do.  Thanks so much!"

Buying nice breeches is must for me as the cheapos wear out quickly.  Edit: Tuff Rider's bamboo breaches only lasted two rides and the crotch had a hole.

I got Ariat Paddock boots from Ebay, that were only $50 and are practically brand new.  They are lace up, but your half chaps go over top, so having a lace come loose is never a problem.    I went middle of the road on my half chaps and got some suede ones for $50, and they are starting to show some wear after riding once a week for the last 5 months.  I think spending $100 on a better pair would be worth it.  When I tried them on I liked the Tredsteps better, but its all personal preference.   You really need to try on breeches, everything fits everyone differently.  I wear Tuffriders because they are cheap, and I like the ribbed versions, they don't show panty lines as much.  I would suggest low rise, unless you want ones that come up to your belly button.  Low rise is really only half an inch lower.  It wouldn't be terrible to buy a pair of more expensive breeches, and a cheaper pair.  See what works better and lasts longer."

They're very comfortable. The only con to them is that they don't have as much as a heel as I'd like. However, I've never had any problems with the zipper and bonus, they're water proof so when it rains and I have to go through mud or water, I don't get wet socks and feet.

Horses,39y29b,dancingmillie,2,Mon Jun 15 21:24:29 2015 UTC,"I prefer suede or synthetic half chaps. Leather is too hot for the summer and requires maintenance. It's nice to be able to wash them in a machine, and the sporty synthetic ones breathe really well. You could also try tall boots instead of short boots + half chaps - they often give better ankle support but they suck to walk in. Unfortunately a lot of horse people are about the image and spend a lot of money on expensive gear just because it's pretty. Oh - you can usually get quality used stuff cheaply on eBay but you should probably try on in store first."

They don't rub against my boot at all, and have lasted me through shows and riding 3x a week for more than a year now. Although they may be a bit out of your price range, I can't remember exactly what I paid for them.   If you can't get a pair of those, the most important thing is that you don't want any kind of heavy elastic or velcro on the bottom of the breeches. Ankles... ow. You'll want to find something with a stretchy material on the bottom, almost like the bottom cuff of the pants are like a stretchy legging."

Horses,39y29b,silver_slinky,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:20:01 2015 UTC,"I actually work in a tack shop part time so this is my time to shine! What the best value is for you is going to depend on what you're looking to get our of your equipment. Provided that you think that you are going to continue to ride for at least two more years here's what I would suggest.  Boots: Splurge here. This is important. Ariat or blundstone are excellent value. They will last you forever. Don't worry about zippers, they can be replaced.   Chaps: First, consider a tall boot instead. The ariat heritage is the same price as a leather boot and half chap at $289. I prefer this option personally.   The synthetic leather chaps by Saxon are ok. Moxie makes a less traditional looking chap that is a better value at $35. They are very light and breathable and people who purchase them are happy with them. Leather chaps are nicer and will last longer but the value on a budget is questionable.   Tights: Riding tights will hold up to the friction of riding better than running tights or leggings.  Tuffrider tights are the cheapest and are ok quality. Do not buy their breeches if you can help it.  Kerrits flow rise tights are a good value. Nice light material. Buy them in store as I believe the ones dover has in stock still have the old style draw string in them which is irritating.   Irideon tights are fantastic. Moderately priced and wear like iron. I've had some for 4 years and they look like new. And I ride five days a week. They material is very breathable and comfortable as well. Note: If you normally wear a woman's small you can wear a child's XL in these, it is the same size."
Horses,39y29b,whomad1215,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:02:55 2015 UTC,"I got boots and chaps and helmet! So excited. I have a really stupid question.......... How do I tell which chap goes on which leg? I got home and tried them on and realized I wasn't sure.  I didn't get tights or breeches. I tried on several breeches but didn't love any of them. I liked both the kerrits and the irideons a lot. Your glowing review for the irideons makes me lean that way, but I think the grippy carrots all the way up might be handy. Or weird? I dunno. Any advice?"
Horses,39y29b,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:01:58 2015 UTC,"Chaps will go with the leather panel on the inside of your leg and the zipper on the outside. If the zipper is in the back there is probably a stretch panel that goes on the outside.  About 8 out of 10 people put them on backwards the first time so you're not alone in your confusion!  Kerrits makes a great tight and if you prefer the way they feel that's the way you should go! I have a pair of grippy Kerrits tights that also have icefil in them that I like very much. The faux full seat grip feels more secure than a tight without that feature. If you like a little extra grip this will work nicely. The icefil material is great if you are going to be sweating as it keeps you cool and dry. To me it feels a bit warmer than other tights when I am not sweating, however.   Best of luck!"

Horses,39x9ul,KittenVicious,2,Mon Jun 15 16:58:44 2015 UTC,Be sneaky about it if you go to a laundromat.  Last time I tried to wash my blankets at one the attendant yelled at me and then made me pay for another wash afterwards (I guess to rise out the stink and hair)
Horses,39x9ul,Kimgoesrawrrr,2,Mon Jun 15 18:52:54 2015 UTC,It was either pay for another load or she was going to report me for damaging the washers because I guess heavy blankets (these were winter ones)  damage washers? Idk.  Never went back there though.
Horses,39x9ul,Kimgoesrawrrr,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:10:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't want to be yelled at. I took my dog bedding in once and got screamed at."
Horses,39x9ul,KittenVicious,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:16:45 2015 UTC,"Glad you never went back, they scammed you: How does running another load fix a damaged washer?"
Horses,39x9ul,theycallmehavoc,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:24:19 2015 UTC,Do you think it would work if I put vinegar in a spray bottle and sprayed them down and let them sun dry them out?
Horses,39x9ul,NeverendingStarchild,2,Mon Jun 15 20:28:39 2015 UTC,"If you can't send them to a professional, I have found that the Rambo blanket wash works really well to get the wet blanket smell to go away. It also protects the waterproofing! (I bought mine through smartpak)"
Horses,39x9ul,acmspirited,2,Mon Jun 15 21:27:15 2015 UTC,Make sure to treat them after washing since washing is going to destroy the water repellent. Some blanket companies make special detergents that are not supposed to break down the waterproofing but if you need to re-apply just get a spray from a sporting goods store.

Horses,39tjv7,samacc,3,Sun Jun 14 19:21:09 2015 UTC,"I know how you feel. We were forced to sell our first horse, a QH gelding, a few years back. We could not have hoped for better buyers. Home farm, mom and daughter both ride. He had bad hooves, as most qhs do, and his navicular got really bad shortly after they bought him. He's mostly a pasture ornament now, occasionally someone will get on for a short walk, and he's happy and fat and has better care than we could have given him. It's scary selling a horse, but we got lucky."
Horses,39tjv7,astrodog88,2,Sun Jun 14 21:24:12 2015 UTC,"QH's do seem to have a major problem with that. Our one rescue we had come threw had navicular really bad, the vet and farrier decided to put him in egg shoes and rubber pads. Where things got bad, is the people in charge of that particular rescue sent him a barrel racer and the new owner followed what she said and raced him like that, back to back for about 4 months. He was completely stallbound after that, poor guy."
Horses,39tjv7,randomblonde,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:00:18 2015 UTC,Apparently it's because they're bred to have small feet.

Horses,39tjv7,ponies-n-tardises,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:24:56 2015 UTC,"I'm jealous!  When I sold my first horse I sold him to a girl and her mom who kept their other horses on a huge acreage at her grandparents house. They told me that because of all this land they'd never have to sell him and he could live out the rest of his days there once it was time for him to retire. She's had him for four years and trying to sell him because she's too busy. Part of me gets it, but the other part is mad.   And sadly I already have one horse I can barely afford....."
Horses,39tjv7,hoofbeats,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:44:48 2015 UTC,"That's a tough spot to be in. I'm sorry you're going through this right now. It hurts to not be able to snatch them right back sometimes. I am still searching for a horse that was sold by people I free leased him to. More just to see if he's okay than to buy him back.   Some very fortunate few people are able to keep one or multiple horses their entire lives, but that's not the majority of us. All you can do is find them a good home when yours is no longer suitable.   I have passed lots of good riding horses on to new homes while keeping a small herd of retirees. I don't have lots of riding time but LOVE giving school horses I rode as a kid their final retirement home. Sometimes horses I have sold or given to good homes end up where I didn't place them originally, but that's life, and none that I know of have hit bad situations.   as long as you look after what you have committed to, from purchase to sale/end of life - all you can do is all you can do!"
Horses,39wlia,bearxfoo,2,Mon Jun 15 11:48:49 2015 UTC,"Pretty good! She still has a little bit of a dip in front of the withers and behind the shoulders. Keep encouraging her to lift the base of her neck by allowing her to come into the bridle as she engages her hind end. Also if you haven't recently you might think about having the saddle fitter out to double check your saddle, especially if her shape has changed a lot recently as an I'll fitting saddle may stagnate your progress. Seems like you're doing the right things though, best of luck!"
Horses,39wlia,silver_slinky,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:32:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much! Unfortunately I already know that my saddle is not a great fit... I'm not really sure what to do, as this is the second ""custom"" made saddle I've had done for her (the first one was a PERFECT fit but the seat was too big, originally made for my husband, and I kick myself every day for selling it). I currently ride with an CSI saddle pad to try and mitigate some of the ill effects of it."
Horses,39wlia,AtomicPenny,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:53:46 2015 UTC,Is your saddle flocked?
Horses,39wlia,AtomicPenny,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:26:08 2015 UTC,"I ride western, no flocking here. :P"
Horses,39wlia,silver_slinky,2,Mon Jun 15 17:52:19 2015 UTC,I should have finished scrolling through the pictures - I always default english!
Horses,39wlia,imakemyownluck,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:14:51 2015 UTC,"I can sympathize as I'm no stranger to the saddle struggle. If it's a western saddle there's not much you can do besides using corrective padding with it. Anything with flocked panels can be adjusted by a saddle fitter. You might consider using an Australian, edurance, or dressage saddle. The seat is going to be different than what you are used to and a new saddle is an expensive solution, but it doesn't need to be a custom saddle, and you will have more flexibility to adjust the saddle as she develops."
Horses,39wlia,imakemyownluck,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:46:29 2015 UTC,"I ride western. :( It's a bummer, I paid $1400 for this saddle. And the manufacturer is no help. This is my saddle. It's tight on her left shoulder, but fit perfectly on her right shoulder. Otherwise, it's a great fit."

Horses,39r1ty,demon8rix,3,Sun Jun 14 05:09:37 2015 UTC,I've always wondered what makes these relatively popular for horse people to collect. Is it the history of the company or something? Did it just sort of happen?

That said, I absolutely want to finish collecting the Halloween specials, but beyond that I don't think I'll ever buy new ones."
Horses,39s6jw,Aktta,14,Sun Jun 14 06:10:34 2015 UTC,"Take farrier/barefoot trimming classes before you do it again.   It sucks that you don't have a good farrier where you are, but each individual amateur trim isn't going to fuck up your horse's feet- consistent amateur farrier work will though.  Farrier school where I am costs about $2000 (including tools) and takes about 9 months. Ideally you'd do a practicum or an apprenticeship as well. Maybe you can be the non flakey farrier in your area (provided you don't already have a good job you like).   At worst you invest some money that will save you a shitload of cash in the long run.   Please don't become the sole trimmer of your horses. If you are serious about doing it- go through the training process. Otherwise you could be shelling out hundreds or thousands for corrective shoeing."
Horses,39s6jw,altf4life,3,Sun Jun 14 07:24:44 2015 UTC,"Thahaha :D  A small course is recommendeed! But it's possible to learn on your own too. Or go with a trimmer for a while so you learn to handle the tools better. It gets easier.  I started trimming mine yeaaars ago after a one day course, but we had to read 2 books and did a test before practicing a day on dead hooves. We only used a rasp and 2 hoofknives. The idea behind the course is to trim so frequently you don't need nippers, and have a farrier/trimmer check up on you a few times a year, especially in the beginning. You learn most by just doing it!  After those years I went to farrier school to see if I could learn  more and now I'm obsessed with hooves. You can always send pictures if you want to hear my thoughts about it, I don't know where you are from but I think I can recommend some good books. If they're too hard in summer, soak them in some water for a few minutes, sometimes the structures get more visible too after that and what's loose will come off easier too.. When you just start you are dead after 2 hooves usually.. It gets easier :p"
Horses,39s6jw,Yindaisy,2,Sun Jun 14 16:54:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! Dead after 2 hooves was about right lol.
Horses,39s6jw,silver_slinky,2,Mon Jun 15 03:59:50 2015 UTC,"I know plenty of people who trim their horses feet themselves with good results. I did it for a period of four months when I was between farriers and my mare was fine. If I were to suggest a couple of things  the first would be that you not leave the feet long. Cutting a foot to short may leave a horse sore for a few days, but leaving them to long will cause the shape of the hoof to deform over time. This is where you can run into issues. Do not be timid, take what you feel is the appropriate amount of foot. Especially do not leave the toes to long or the heels will start to run under and the easiest way to correct that is a four point shoe. Second see if you can't have the farrier come out some to check up on how you're doing. Third,   buy something like this https://www.valleyvet.com/ct_detail.html?pgguid=8cbde050-5625-416b-80eb-91b35c44fbdd&sfb=1&itemguid=d2531e85-9891-4214-a4d7-c8bb997e113f&utm_content=15510&ccd=IFH003&mr:trackingCode=1C01A364-3C81-E211-BA78-001B21631C34&mr:referralID=NA&mr:device=m&mr:adType=plaonline&mr:ad=43741068043&mr:keyword=&mr:match=&mr:filter=84506586163&gclid=CJyqi7mcj8YCFY8vgQodFDAABw It will make your life easier."

Horses,39p9o5,LeSpy2,7,Sat Jun 13 12:41:56 2015 UTC,"Has docking it up high been discussed with the vet? If she has no use of it then  it's offering no positive benefits to her. If it gets cut it could then fill with fecal matter and get infected, she could roll and break it and end up with an emergency vet visit, etc, etc.  Docking for cosmetic reasons is one thing, doing it from a medical standpoint is another. A horse at the barn I rode at as a kid had a horse with an amputed tail, he got kicked smack in the middle of the ass when he was a yearling and it was broken, vet took it off. He was fine like that, if a bit silly looking."

Horses,39cl95,surefoot_,8,Wed Jun 10 21:22:04 2015 UTC,"I have purchased a horse from auction with very good success.  I went in knowing it was a gamble (but it was very worthwhile for this deal) and set my price limit.  He is a canadian warmblood and at the time of auction he was in bad shape.  Horrid horrid horrid feet, totally wasted topline and had the appearance of a drugged horse.  I checked his pupils, he was not drugged.  He looked about 40 years old.  Checked his teeth.  Teeth said he was around 7/8.  I was shocked.  They led him in the ring and he drug his feet along with his head almost touching the ground and I bought him for 25 over meat price.  They announced him as an 8YO canadian warmblood (consistent with my observations so I took the plunge and added him to my herd).  I couldn't BELIEVE that I was the only one bidding on this horse other than the meat guy.  I thought for sure people (I knew some of them- compete against them) would see what I saw.  But they didn't.  Got him home, on a good meal plan.  His improvement plateaued for a bit recently so I treated (still am treating) him for ulcers and he is now improving rapidly again.  This was him in March - looks even better now  When I go to look at and buy horses I will add this.  No under saddle issues are of great concern to me at all.  I was the right hand gal to a very talented trainer for nearly a decade and in that time have started and retrained all types from simple to the so nasty you thought you were dead that one time you tripped and fell in their pen.  I restart every horse I get.  I've never bought a 'finished' horse mind you but even one they say is well broke gets restarted.  I poke and prod and push until I find the major holes.    Soundness checks are my main concern.  I first look at confirmation and make sure it lends itself to soundness.  Then I look at obvious things like clean legs/free of soft swellings/bony protrusions etc.  I see them move if at all possible (in the case of this horse his feet were so awful and he was so depressed that I did not get a good chance which added to my risk).  There are ALWAYS people who will nerve block/previcox/1000 other tricks to make their horse seem sound but this is a problem buying anywhere with no contract (not just auction).  Anyway, Maverick is awesome and I would do it again in a heart beat.  He is beginner safe, has spooked one time ever (dog hiding just outside arena door so he couldn't see it lunged at him when we went by).  He placed first in his first ever jumper class last month and has several ribbons in the hunters (quite hunteresque and enjoys his flying changes).  He did well at his first little dressage show too.  He was a bit of a poop about water at first but once over it now crosses everything out on the trails.  I lucked out and kept thinking any minute now he would go dead lame or flip over backwards every time he saw a kid in a red tshirt or some other silly quirk for him to end up at auction.  Hasn't happened in over a year though ;D"
Horses,39cl95,Allyz0r,3,Thu Jun 11 00:12:12 2015 UTC,Oh and I will add -  dont believe any of the info on the write up about it being good at this and that and the other.  It's all fluff and BS and you are better off assuming the horse is MAYBE halterbroke at best.  Go in with that mind set and you might be ok.  If you are not super experienced do not go this route.
Horses,39cl95,Allyz0r,2,Thu Jun 11 00:15:30 2015 UTC,"I enjoy torturing myself by watching End of the Line horse rescue on Facebook. They offer horses bought by the kill buyers prior to the horses shipping to Canada. People update the organization on their horses and some are the best riding horses ever and some are so broken and destroyed by the Amish that they are simply finding a kinder end.  Because of the possible exposure to disease, the organization recommends a 30 day quarantine. There are some beautiful horses though that come out of there and I've considered a few. If I lived closer, I'd probably have one or two.  But buying at auctions is a gamble.  My friend had a gorgeous, young horse named Buck back in the 80s. He lived up to his name and multiple trainers were thrown before the final old horse guy said he wasn't getting on him because Buck had hind leg stripes. He said he'd never seen a horse with leg stripes trained and advised her to sell him. She did and he got passed around. Buck ended up at an auction, all prettied up and sold for $7500. The woman who bought him, said his info said he was a hunter/jumper; she ended up putting him down because he was unridable and wanted to stop the cycle.   That all said, I'd buy at auction, but go into it though knowing the info that comes with the horse could be mostly fictitious."
Horses,39cl95,dome_sweet_dome,2,Wed Jun 10 22:26:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's hit or miss. It depends a lot on where you are and who frequents the auction. I will say that I've seen a lot of quality horse flesh go through the ring, but at the same time we've brought some home that had some holes in them.  Some it was physical issues, some mental, some ended up being wonderful horses.   If you have a good eye, don't plan to bring one home no matter what (be willing to go a few times to find what you are looking for), and have the financial capacity to pick the wrong horse, I'd say go for it."
Horses,39cl95,ksully913,2,Thu Jun 11 00:00:39 2015 UTC,"I have purchased Premarin foals from auctions in Canada, you buy them by the pound so just outbid the kill buyers to get them. I was thrilled with the girls I bought and they turned out to be wonderful horses...but it was a completely soul crushing experience for me. The few times I did that sort of auction were enough for me. I knew the fate of most of the babies and mares being purchased and it was just a lot to deal with emotionally. Even if it was the best outcome for them it's still a whole lot of death about to take place.  I have bought a few OTTBs for people at track auctions and that environment was better (even though many probably met the same fate).   To veer back toward the question asked, diamonds in the rough are completely possible even for the slaughter bound horses. You need to be able to quickly recognize and process a lot of information though - if you don't have the experience to take in conformation, lameness, verify age, signs of injury, and a host of potential red flags then be sure to bring someone with you who can.  Go into it hoping that what you are being told is true but prepare as if everything is a lie. It's a whole lot of reading between the lines, judging the horse on their own merit, and really trusting your gut on what you see and what 'vibe' you get."
Horses,39cl95,AtomicPenny,2,Thu Jun 11 00:01:02 2015 UTC,"I've bid at New Holland auction for myself and on behalf of a local horse rescue.   There are a lot of nice horses dumped at auction.  But there isn't an honest disclosure at these cheaper auctions.   You're lucky if you get a current Coggins.   I have yet to get any sort of records of any type from any horse.  Occasionally you might get papers, but some sellers throw away the papers because they don't want it traced back to them they dumped a nice purebred whatever at that sale.    There are horses given drugs.  If nothing else the horse may be on something like bute.  So there is no soundness guarantee unless that specific horse was sold as sound,  and even then the most they'll do for you is refund the purchase price.     Assume the horse will need training.  Sometimes the horse may need professional training or have some tough behavioral issues.    The way they act run through the ring may not be how they really are.  You must quarantine any horse coming from any auction or broker lot!   I've had Strangles come to my farm 2x.  And unknown shipping sickness once or twice.  You don't want that stuff spreading.      When I go, I always bring someone with me as a 2nd set of eyes.     It is a gamble.   I've gotten some horses I really loved.   But I've also had some horses with serious soundness or behavioral problems.   Budget for the possibility the horse might need something."
Horses,39cl95,funchy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:27:56 2015 UTC,"I purchased my once in a lifetime horse from an auction. At the time, he was an unproven 2 YO quarter horse that the then owner just wanted to get rid of. He was calm and quiet, on a level not typical of a 2YO. We purchased him and then vetted him and drug tested to make sure his calmness wasn't fabricated, and thankfully he was clean. There was trouble getting the owner to transfer the papers, but that was solved through action by the AQHA. 10 plus years later and he is a two-time World Champion (AQHA), multiple top 5, multiple top tens, a top five AQHA congress in the youth, amateur, and open divisions. Even without his accolades, he is the greatest horse I have ever known. Sound body, beautiful and generous mind, brave.  Do I think I will ever have another purchase like that again? No. But I know I'll never find another horse like him anywhere. I think that just because a horse comes from an auction, doesn't mean they are going to have limits to what they can do. If they have the mind and the heart, they can take you almost anywhere."

She didn't have an ounce of gait in her; all she did was completely hard pace.   Now she's a great horse, they trail ride together, has an awesome flat walk, running walk and rack, they enter shows together and they both seem to make a great team.   Auctions are a risk but really, so is buying a horse from Mr. Joe Nobody online who's advertising ""the perfect horse"". People lie whether its on an online ad, the auction ring, or at your barn. Make informed decisions, and be ready for anything, with any horse you buy. :)"

I've never had a bad experience buying from an auction, but I'm always buying young unbroke projects or the old skeletal ponies that even the meat buyers don't want, and would be bolted on site and shipped deadstock if I didn't throw $20 at them.

I have never ever seen something like that with horses. Dogs however sometimes have breed rivalries, which is more based off of what they are bred for. My border collies only really like other border collies because their energy levels match and they all generally play the same way. But that's dogs, not horses, they're a little different."

She's scared of them but will stand at a safe distance and do nothing but growl at them. They come wagging around her at all and she hightails it out of there yiping, and then resumes her growling.

If they are a dominant horse, they will have a harder time getting along with everyone. A laid back horse will just do whatever makes him happy.  There are some stereotypes to breeds. Like Shetlands being cranky and hard to get along with. Arabs and Thoroughbreds being batshit crazy and therefore might stir the pot.  Also, I wouldn't be surprised if a Shetty took on a Clydey and won haha"

Horses,39c035,llamacardigan,3,Wed Jun 10 19:10:57 2015 UTC,"i practice relaxation/calming techniques in general, and they work for when I am riding and find myself getting anxious, which used to happen all the time (but that may be because I was in my thirties and sitting on a half-ton animal for the very first time only 3 years ago).  Basically, remembering to breathe is essential.  A relaxing breath is one that you breath in through your nose (smell the roses) and then exhale through your mouth (blow out the candles).  I remind myself to do this when I am riding and am nervous.    Anxiety/nerves is in your head, so repeating the mantra you already stated is really going to help too.  You KNOW that you are a decent rider, that you are comfortable, that you are safe, etc.  You know this trainer will be ok, that the horse is ok.  You keep in the back of your mind that there is always a risk, but that you are doing everything you can to mitigate that risk and keep it as low as possible because you are ALWAYS safe and attentive, etc.  That's how I keep my cool at least.    calm breathing and remembering to think at the first sign of anxiousness."
Horses,39c035,AuntieChiChi,3,Wed Jun 10 19:40:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you! It's sometimes hard to keep all of these things in mind, but it does really help. My trainer always tells me to breath too, especially when I'm approaching a jump. It's an odd combination of letting go and focusing, but it's begining to become more natural."
Horses,39c035,AuntieChiChi,5,Wed Jun 10 19:48:07 2015 UTC,"i too have a tendency to hold my breath at random points in my riding.  It's funny that she has to remind me to breath because I teach phlebotomy and have to remind my students to breath!    And I agree, it is a weird combination of letting go and focusing - same with your muscles - you have to relax them at the same time you engage them!  Sounds confusing, but once you get the feel for it, it doesn't seem so weird!"
Horses,39c035,heybabalooba,2,Wed Jun 10 23:04:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah today with the trainer we worked a lot on keeping my shoulders relaxed and core tight and seat forward and fingers tight and arms loose, etc. It's a lot to think about at once, but it's gratifying to watch more and more of it become natural and muscle memory. I remeber when I first started riding and I couldn't even remeber to keep my heels down, or when I couldn't figure out the posting diagonal but now those things are easy for me."
Horses,39c035,hoofbeats,4,Wed Jun 10 23:18:36 2015 UTC,What's there to be nervous about? I find riding more relaxing than most other activities
Horses,39c035,bearxfoo,2,Thu Jun 11 03:24:26 2015 UTC,"As someone once suggested to me on this site: singing definitely gets rid of nerves, helps you breathe and can help with rhythm. Also counting your strides out loud or in you head. I also found that taking the time to stretch my muscles out before walking into the barn can be very calming and improve your ride."
Horses,39c035,sam-29-01-14,2,Thu Jun 11 14:50:28 2015 UTC,"The only time I'm ever nervous on my horse is if I think she's going to spook or act goofy at a time that could seriously get us both hurt. For example, I'm not fond of bridge crossings with my mare because she IS a spooky horse and spooking on a bridge could certainly cause both of us harm or even death.   When she does get goofy, I just breathe, talk to myself, and try to stay as calm as possible. Horses pick up on your nervousness so if you're nervous, they become more nervous and its a vicious cycle.  Overall, though, I find riding to be relaxing, calming, and really the next best thing to therapy and medication. And I'd never be nervous while riding if I had a horse that wasn't as high strung as mine."

They'll also step on their own feet and not feel it, and I think that's another reason people use them in the hunt field.   I'm in the ""thanks, but I'm okay"" camp. Maybe ask her why she is concerned- has your horse run this woman over, or are you the one taking primary care of her while she's there? Is she just afraid of her? Does she just like you and want to hang out? (I'm imagining a timid lonely-ish ""cat lady"" type person, because I also have a friend who always suggests natural horsemanship, and she's like that. Less self-righteous, more just enjoying sharing ""the gospel"")"
Horses,39dho0,mrflossin,3,Thu Jun 11 03:10:36 2015 UTC,"Ha! Yeah I've known my mare since she was a long yearling and it's just been how she treats new people, I think. If you get after her once she's fine. Previous barn had no issues and she could be brought in with her pasture mate, so it makes me wonder if it's just people doing turn out not being firm enough. As I mentioned, I have no problems with her.  I did ask her for clarification and she just mentioned the pushiness again, no specifics, which is made me more wary to set up training. I think she wants clients since I had mentioned seeking out trainers, just not groundwork trainers. She does do some of the handling, and teenage girls help and handle my horse a bit too. I'll be leaving at the end of this month and moving my mare home so I'll be handling her completely from that point out.

As a note, I work at two different barns, and I would never tell an owner that their horse is pushy or rude on the ground. If they are out of control I would let the trainer know, but as a horse person she should be able to handle a pushy horse. Most horses honestly don't have good ground manners and most horses' owners make their ground manners worse by coddling them or seeing what their horse is doing with rose colored glasses. She's not your trainer and it's not her job to train your horse, just like it's not my job to train other people's horses at the barns that I do work, and it's not my place to tell the owner their horse has shitty ground manners. Every horse I work with respects me though. As a horse owner I would actually be quite insulted if the BO or someone who was not my trainer told me that, it's just not their place."

Horses,399gqh,kalaibii,27,Wed Jun 10 05:31:49 2015 UTC,"I would not, and to be honest, I would switch barns. I've met instructors like ones you describe, and they're basically only in it for the money. They'll buy a cheap horse (thoroughbreds are going for something like $500 where I am) and put a green rider on it, even if they're mismatched. If she's really pushing you for this lease, I'd stop and ask why? Is it really because none of the schoolies are at your level? If they're all little quarter horses for little children, maybe switching barns would give you the opportunity to ride some more challenging horses. Also, even dead broke school horses can use a more advanced rider to tune them up. If you've only been riding again for six months, riding a dead broke horse might not be a bad thing.   $1000 a month for a lease is very expensive, depending on your location and facilities. I would talk to some other barn owners in the area and ask what they charge for lease. At my barn we get basically the same, asides from the lessons, (only one a week) for a fraction of that cost.   See if your instructor will let you come up for a portion of the lesson cost in an ""open-ride"" style to perfect your skills. Offer to muck stalls in exchange for riding time.   If you're dead set on leasing or buying, don't rush into it. I know it can be tempting when a trainer is flashing this pretty horse, saying how well you'd do on it, but take a step back and ask why. I'm not trying to discourage you, leasing is vey fun! But maybe this horse isn't for you. Maybe you'd rather wait a few more months and spend that time learning exactly what you want. I would definitely talk to some of the other people leasing and boarding at your barn, get their opinions. I would also talk to other barn owners in the area. I've seen all too often instructors pushing their students into a horse they're not ready for for money.   Also look into a part-board. Is one of the boarders at your barn not up very often? Talk to someone, and say if you pay half the board you might be able to exercise their horse a few times a week. A few people I know do this, and they love it.  I wouldn't worry too much about time. If you can already make it out two to three times a week, and the horse is getting fed and watered by the barn staff, then you're good. Two to three times a week is a lot more than tons of owners I know!  Whatever you do, be cautious. Take time to think, make a pros and cons list, and see what happens. If owning a horse is your dream, (like mine!), and you think you are financially able, then spend a few months perfecting what you want. A horse is a large investment for thirty some years. It's worth it to wait a few months.   You could go for a shot in the dark and get a winner with this horse, but I'd wait and talk to some people and really think before deciding. Look into helping in exchange for riding, open rides, or part boarding. Good luck in whatever you choose!"
Horses,399gqh,fivefootnothing,2,Wed Jun 10 06:00:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you all SO much for the feedback. I wanted to update with a few comments as I was in full fledged ""panic I'm gonna go broke"" attack last night and was like ""REDDIT SAVE ME!!!!"" (I'm an anxious person). I standardized this response as I feel like it's applicable to all but I'm SO appreciative of the advice! Three things that I feel I need to point out because I've painted my trainer in an unfair light: a. I've told her I want to lease a horse. I've been telling her this for months, it's not like she's looking or trying to pressure me without me bringing it up. I've told her no to a few much older horses before, and she hasn't had a problem with it. This horse isn't hers, it's at another barn. This horse isn't for lease, it's for sale, and she's offering to buy him FOR me and let me lease from her and buy at end of year if I like him. She would keep him if I don't... so I don't think she's trying to just get a deal out of me, she actually thinks the horse is good enough to buy herself. calculating out what she pays at the barn/horse, she's only making a $200 profit above what I already pay her for my current lessons (and I was going to increase that with or without leasing a horse). I REALLY don't think she's just trying to make a sale. b. I'm lucky enough to be really close with another friend who has been riding in the bay area since she was a toddler (she's 25). She actually recommended my trainer as they rode together since they were in elementary school (she's more biased in my favor, and would warn me if anything was unfair, don't worry). At other barns, she says there are riders that pay $1000 a month just to ride twice a week and have the opportunity to show. I tried out 3-4 barns before settling where I am... they're all more expensive than what I'm getting here (and honestly, I feel like most of our schoolhorses are in better shape), the $1000 is for not only board, my 3 lessons a week, but also my trainer would work with the horse additionally on days I don't ride, turnout, feedings, etc. And obviously I can ride whenever I want. She's trying to introduce me to the costs of actually owning your own horse. c. The thing that hit home from most of the comments is how green the horse probably is. Why can't I continue to learn on a schoolmaster? Why can't I get an older horse? These concerns hit me, and I emailed her this morning explaining my concern. She said she understands and is going to fight to get us a trial period. And I would LOVE to continue to ride on schoolmasters. Honestly I love love LOVE the horse I'm riding now. But what kills me is that because of his age, we're capping out pretty quickly at what we can do, how high we can jump (we're at 2'6 right now and pretty much plateued). I don't want to jump from horse to horse, it's going to be hard to walk away from him as I feel like each horse is different. I want a horse I could potentially ride for the next couple years, not one who I'm going to fall in love with and then won't be able to move with me to the next level. Is this horse going to be that horse for me? Maybe not, maybe, as you all have mentioned, he's too green. I am committed to making sure I am firm with myself and realistic... is the horse mature enough for me? I also asked my trainer if my close friend, the one who's been riding since she was young, could also ride the horse during the trial. I HOPE THIS SATISFIES ALL OF YOU. I am open now to saying ""No"" to this greener horse and keep looking. If we trial him and he's awesome, great. I do want to lease, but I'm really in love with my trainer and this barn. If I have to keep riding my schoolhorse all year, I'd be happy with that, I just wanted to find a partner to help me grow."
Horses,399gqh,fivefootnothing,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:01:17 2015 UTC,"Good luck! I really hope you find yourself the perfect horse to lease or buy. Trust your gut, if you think this is the one, then go for it. If not, wait a little and something will come around. Asking for a trial period is a great idea."
Horses,399gqh,Found_your_marbles,21,Wed Jun 10 18:09:16 2015 UTC,I would be very cautious about a trainer that wants you to lease a green horse when you're still a green rider.  I suggest looking for a horse in whatever discipline you are in that is retired from upper level but can still do lower level stuff for lease when you outgrow school horses.  Good luck!
Horses,399gqh,Found_your_marbles,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:44:06 2015 UTC,"Is it impossible do you think for a horse to be mature at the age of 7? Some of the horses I have tried out (before finding my current one I'm obsessed with) have been super stubborn, that's true, but even the current one I'm riding has issues we have to work with consistently (picking up the wrong lead, rushing, coming off the rail, etc). Will it be 110% worse with a 7 year old horse?"
Horses,399gqh,ksully913,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:02:54 2015 UTC,"A 7y/o most likely does not have the experience that an older horse would have.  The problems you described  do not sound dangerous to a beginner (well it depends on the extent of the rushing and if it's over fences).  7 years old is not necessarily young, but for a new rider it is.  Riding a horse could ruin your confidence, and the horse's confidence.  If you have a choice, I would say lease the horse that you could have fun on and not worry too much so you can learn to ride safely.  Save the 7 year old for when you are competing and want a horse that can go up the levels with you:)"
Horses,399gqh,showmebevelle,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:11:05 2015 UTC,"No, it shouldn't be 100% worse. It all depends on the horse.  An off the track TB was probably broke at 2-3 years old and has a lot more experience at 7 than your average warmblood.  It all depends on how they are trained, who started them and how much time they have spent under saddle.  For example - rushing doesn't ever need to be an issue with a horse started correctly over fences, no matter the age. Same with coming off the rail."
Horses,399gqh,nspikeu,12,Wed Jun 10 18:49:41 2015 UTC,"I had a trainer like this. She pushed me to buy a green broke QH for 5,500 off her and sell my sweet little paint horse.  I rode the horse three times and he nearly killed me.  I got so terrified I quit riding, sold off my stuff, and she talked me into giving her the horse because now it wasn't safe to sell.  A while later I bought my two horses that I have now and I've had to relearn everything because my nerves destroyed my ability to ride.  Think long and hard. There's no actual harm riding horses that are a little 'below you.'"
Horses,399gqh,amousecaledmicky,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:18:09 2015 UTC,"That's awful :( I'm really sorry about that experience and I definitely don't want that to happen. When I originally started at this barn the horse I was riding bucked me 3x (not on lesson days) and my trainer immediately got me onto a different horse. That's why I feel like she wouldn't knowingly put me on something she thought would be frightening. She's not making a profit off this deal, she's buying the horse for me."
Horses,399gqh,funchy,12,Wed Jun 10 17:04:23 2015 UTC,"Nope, nope, nope. Nothing can dash your confidence more then hopping on a green horse that's way to much to handle.   You do need to try out different horses, and find one that you feel comfortable with, but that can challenge you. There are so many types of horses locking onto one is something people do alot, but I think there is huge benefit to different horses and what they can teach you, and how you will progress.  I am a beginner rider, and worked on a ranch for a bit. I rode mainly four different types of horses:   The dull horse: all he does is go head to tail eith another horse. Calm, solid and boring, you would be lucky to get him to do anything interesting. Poor guy.  The experienced asshole who is brilliant but takes full advantage of newbies by displaying all sorts of bad and cantankerous behavior that can be quite scary. (Like disregarding the reigns altogether and running off)  The horse that feels like a ferrari: I rode a huge standardbred, a nag by any experienced riders standards, but compared to the asshole, he was incredibly good willed, soft and interesting. I was one with him, he didn't accept just a passenger, I had to have an active role all the time with him. He was nimble, fast and a little flighty, but at the same time a confidence builder, he felt very safe and solid. He was a honest horse. He taught me alot!  The teacher. After riding the asshole (who ran away with me and I nearly fell off on a steep downhill) this horse could feel fear, so he went slow. He was steady as a rock. He never went faster then a trot (I was afraid of the canter) As my confidence progressed he began to walk faster, make different movements, and he started to canter and challenge me. He accepted either a passenger or an active rider, but never resorted to cantankerous or really naughty behavior. He was consistent, he never did anything unexpected and that was a huge boost. He was my favorite, I would trust everything to that horse.  Green horses: I didn't ride any of these but many of the other people did. These were unpredictable, they required constant attention, a thing which really seemed exciting for some people, however it was not so exciting when during a lax moment her horse jumped the stream instead of wading through and she ended up in the hospital.   The ferrari: these are top notch horses that do everything, but they take cues so small you had better be an excellent rider.  It would be better to pay attention to building your own skill rather then having to worry about teaching your horse or preparing yourself for a random buck, spook or other unpredictable behavior.  There are always green horses, save them for when you are experienced enough to know what you are getting into."
Horses,399gqh,notantisocial,2,Wed Jun 10 08:24:03 2015 UTC,I agree with the fact that I should be trying out more horses. I mentioned this to her this morning.  Thanks I feel like I've gotten those horse stereotypes as well. SO ACCURATE! lol
Horses,399gqh,horses_fart_on_me,8,Wed Jun 10 17:05:01 2015 UTC,"Op please listen to advice here. Your post seems to look for qualification and someone to tell you yes. But if you are asking strangers on the Internet what you should do when concerned, and as you said tend to make impulse decisions, THEN DON'T!  you don't really list any good reasons for taking a lease,only concerns. I strongly suggest waiting this out and stopping your research for a horse to lease or buy."

Horses,399gqh,cyberthief,4,Wed Jun 10 17:05:45 2015 UTC,"I feel like the instructor may be exploiting your dreams a bit.  If you're paying her for lessons and this is a lesson barn,  it's her job to provide suitable horses.    If you've had lessons for 6 months, i think it would be fair to assume your not looking for an upper level show horse.   What you need to be riding is a good schoolie who maybe did lower level shows awhile back.  You do not want anything green or project right now, even with the instructor offering to help.   Thoroughbreds are rather inexpensive to buy,  unless he's got extensive training or show wins.  If he's green, in my area he'd sell for $500 to $1000.   Maybe she truly believes this horse is worth $4k.   But I hate to see you get locked into a long term commitment especially on a horse that may not be worth it or perfect for you.  If he needs more training than he gets when you ride, it'll be additional fees to have additional pro rider/trainer work with him  Be aware that if she isn't getting suitable school horses and he comes out of the field lame (such as with a hoof abscess), you now have zero horses to ride.     does she discount the monthly lease fee if he's got an issue that takes a month to resolve?     If you're ready to go to the next level and this lesson barn doesn't have the right horses, I'd seriously consider looking at other lesson barns.  She may be a great instructor.   But you need to be matched with both great instructor and great horse.    And a lesson barn that has well trained horse tends to have several,  so you're not taking a huge risk if a horse can't work some days."
Horses,399gqh,ksully913,2,Wed Jun 10 14:22:49 2015 UTC,"I think leasing a horse is a good idea if you can afford it and its the right horse. Many trainers offset their cost by having people lease horses, which is fine, it is hard to make money in the horse industry, some people do this more ethically than others.  There is no rush. There are plenty of good horses out there and you have the rest of your life to ride and enjoy horses. So start with a horse that is SAFE, bombproof, older, slower. In 6 months you might be ready for something else. Make sure you are doing it because you are ready and you have the time or money.   If you are paying a fortune and don't have a ton of time to ride, and then rushedly ride, as a beginner you may make inexperienced mistakes and fall off or get hurt. I will promise you that NOTHING will be a joy kill faster then getting hurt and being scared. Why take that risk?"
Horses,399gqh,ksully913,2,Wed Jun 10 12:32:10 2015 UTC,"At 7 a thoroughbred is close to mental maturity, are over being awkward and will be close to the horse they will be forever. Be that honest, brave, nervous or dirty. It is the best age to get that breed and know what you will have. Sounds like you have put alot of consideration into this and covered  all your bases.  Try him, vet him and trust your trainer.  It seems to me some of those that responded didn't read your entire post, or are unfamiliar with the cost of quality horse care and training on the west coast.  My girlfriend trains in Temecula and charges $1200 month for board and full training/lessons. I see thoroughbreds that can coarse going for 12k at 4 years old. You know where the horse is coming from, clearly not an auction horse being hustled onto an unsuspecting rube."
Horses,399gqh,showmebevelle,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:21:19 2015 UTC,"Hi! I agree with everyone here -- definitely not the thing to rush in to, and it seems like this horse might not be the best fit. The last thing you want to do is pair a green horse with a green-ish rider -- most riders have a hard time and lose their confidence, and then struggle to regain that.   Also, you'll have a lot more time now in school than when working. Where in the bay do you ride? If you're looking to switch schools to ride more advanced horses let me know. I used to ride in the Portola Valley/Woodside area."

Horses,399enz,Cat_Diesel_Power,3,Wed Jun 10 05:11:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about minis in particular, but I can give some insight into preventing a founder. My mare's the same, she's a morgan pony and although she's never foundered before, there's a possibility with her.  First of all, limit his grain. If you have to feed him, or if he gets anxious when the others get fed, give him a quarter scoop of low energy pellets. Try to avoid any meds that are heavy on steroids.   Exercise. Even if you can only take him for walks around the property, or even if you just go out into the field and snap a lunge line a few times. Getting him moving will burn off the excess energy.  Check for a ""crest line"". Basically feel the top of his neck, where the mane is, and see if it's starting to feel thicker. The thicker it is, the more likely he is to founder. Also check his feet. If you can feel a heavy pulse above the bulbs of the heel, that's a bad sign. If there's heat in the hoof (can be subjective, since some horses stand in cool mud compared to hot stand, use your judgement skills), that's also a bad sign.   If the mini's only out in the morning and is in the rest of the day then he should be fine. If you're really worried try and see if you can get a line of electric fence and divide the pasture so he only has access to some of it. Or close the gate to the big pasture every other day. If he only has access to the big field four days out of seven, that will also reduce his risk to founder.   If you do find him foundering, you'll be able to tell. He won't be able to walk and will look like he's trying to hold all his weight on his back legs. Throw his feet into a bucket of ice water and call the vet.   Good luck, I think your mini will be okay with what you've got with a bit of management!"

Horses,3989iv,dunmorestriden,6,Tue Jun 9 23:40:30 2015 UTC,"I'm a vet and farrier and I disagree about the wedges.  Wedging a horse will make him feel better temporarily, but it will end up crushing the heels more.  Most, if not all, horses with negative palmar angle (where the back part of the coffin bone is lower than the front) have very poorly-developed digital cushions.  The digital cushion sits between the frog and the coffin bone, in the back of the foot.  It forms a sling, along with the lateral cartilages, to support the coffin bone.  In a healthy foot, the heels should be low.  In a poorly developed foot, there is not enough soft tissue to prevent the coffin bone from dropping in the back.    To solve this problem temporarily, use the wedges.  To solve this problem permanently (potentially), remove the shoes entirely and put the horse on river rock (4-6 inches deep) daily, starting with 1 hour at a time.  This will stimulate his feet to produce better, tougher soft tissue to support the coffin bone.  It's like sending the hooves to boot camp.  It may also help produce more sole, reversing the flat-footedness.  Here's an article that goes more in depth about the different treatments, including those using hardware.  I still highly recommend the river rock therapy, regardless of what you decide to do, especially if he's fairly young.   You never know what the hooves are capable of until you send them to boot camp."
Horses,3989iv,skipsteejsprat,3,Wed Jun 10 00:31:01 2015 UTC,River rock? Like as in take him down to a river and walk him around on the rocks? And he's only 7. He's has this problem since I bought him when he was 4 and it never showed up as an issue until last week :/
Horses,3989iv,skipsteejsprat,2,Wed Jun 10 00:55:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, river rock, although it's better to make a pen and lock him in it, or put some in a stall.  If his soles are thinner, get smaller sized rocks, like pea sized.  If his soles are thicker, you can go up to nickel sized.  I'll put this in italics for effect: River rock has the power to transform a hoof in a way that no farrier/trimmer/shoe can.. It really is amazing stuff.  It stimulates without being painful.  Even if the horse is actively avoiding his heels, the hoof will sink and the rocks will stimulate the frog, sole, lateral cartilages and digital cushion.  He can also adjust the angle of his hoof while he's in there to rest his tendons and ease any pain.  It also keeps the hooves dry, which is vital to sole and frog health.  We start with 1 hour at a time because it really is intense stimulation.  Sometimes it's the only way I can get a horse to start landing heel first on his own.  Boots and pads are not enough if he's actively avoiding his heels.    Edit: I was trying to find a link to some studies for you, but I'm on my phone and my service is shit.  Google 'pea gravel hoof Bowker'.  Dr Bowker has done some studies showing it increases blood flow.   River rock is expensive, but IMO, worth every cent.  Every stable should have some available.  Better yet, every horse should have access to it, starting from birth.  Then maybe we wouldn't have half the hoof problems we do."

I really believe that if more horses grew up with it, their hooves would be so much stronger and more resilient.  People nowadays raise their horses on soft stall bedding, soft pastures, etc.  They pick all the rocks out of the pasture.  All this bubble-wrapping is leading to weak hooves and bodies."

Horses,3989iv,skipsteejsprat,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:24:22 2015 UTC,"What do you think about the natural balance aluminum shoes(my farrier uses them, I don't remember the exact name)? They work the same as pads and are wedged but you can set back the heel and breakover point wonderfully with them. Would those be helpful at all in this situation?"
Horses,3989iv,DreamRaid,2,Wed Jun 10 19:34:44 2015 UTC,"Bringing the break over point back is good for pretty much all situations.  A big problem with these shoes (and all shoes), however, is that they don't allow proper use and stimulation of the caudal foot.  The frog, digital cushion and lateral cartilages are made perfectly to absorb impact and concussion.  When a shoe props the heels off the ground, even a little, it does two things.  #1, it transfers shock and concussion directly through the hoof wall and into the bony column.  (I could go into much more detail on this one, since it involves not just concussion, but also blood flow.)  #2, it allows the structures to become weaker over time, or at least not develop like they should.  80-90% of the horses I see have some degree of degeneration or lack of development with the caudal foot structures.  I think a big part of that is shoes raising the heels off the ground.  Also lack of exercise, stall-keeping, etc.  Horses desperately need the caudal hoof to be on the ground."
Horses,3989iv,skipsteejsprat,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:57:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you! That's very interesting. My horse I recently acquired has pancake feet, and my farrier recommended the aluminum shoes. Would they be good for correcting pancake hooves? I'll be riding her 5-6 x a week, so he recommends I put shoes on her."
Horses,3989iv,DreamRaid,2,Wed Jun 10 20:08:19 2015 UTC,"If her soles are thin, stimulating them with pea gravel may kick-start them.  Usually in middle aged or older horses, I don't see as good of a response.  Another thing to try is using a shoe or a cast that wraps around the outside of the hoof wall.  This seems to stimulate sole thickening in some.  If I can't get any sole growth at all and the horse is uncomfortable, I'll use plastic shoes.  They reduce concussion better than metal.    Just be sure that there are no flares.  As long as the wall is not supporting the inner structures, you'll never get good sole depth.

Horses,3989iv,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:37:39 2015 UTC,Would gravel (like bigger sized round gravel) work too? I mean obviously not as well but would it help at all?
Horses,3989iv,skipsteejsprat,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:45:34 2015 UTC,"Depends on the state of the hoof in question.  For healthy hooves, any type of gravel is no problem.  For slightly weak hooves, driveway gravel is too sharp and therefore painful.  For moderately weak hooves, even larger round river rock (quarter sized) may be too much.  For very weak hooves, you'll need pea sized smooth rocks to distribute pressure more.   Think of it as Boot Camp 1, 2, 3, and 4 (small, medium and large river rock and then 4 is sharp driveway gravel).   As far as benefit, as long as the horse is comfortable, whatever gravel he's on will be beneficial.  If he's not comfortable, you'll cause more harm than good."

On top of that I pay about $20 a month for grain that I buy at Tractor Supply and feed myself when needed.  My barn prior to that was $400/mo per horse for the same thing as my current one but was right on 100's of miles of trails, so the bulk of that board was paying for the locale. Aside from vet/farrier costs I usually look at feed, cleaning and extra's like turn out, blanketing, fly masts on/off, etc.  The 2 barns I've been at have all charged extra for those ""extras"".   I hope that helps!   Happy Trails!"

Horses,398h3b,AtomicPenny,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:37:50 2015 UTC,"And it's actually cheap for this area, in terms of places with grass turnout and a good arena and a trainer that travels to both A and local shows. I could board at other places for less, I'm sure, but I want to compete at the A-level, and need someone to ride my horse as I travel a lot for work.

Horses,398h3b,Supakwe,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:10:01 2015 UTC,"I live in southeastern Virginia and board here depends on how much you have your horse turned out for. I have my horse turned out from 7 am to around 4:30pm for $475. If you let your horse be turned out 24/7 (only taken into their stall AM and PM for grain feeding) it is $425.   Most other barns are closer to $500, $600, or even more, but this farm is not for profit. The barn owners breed some Arabians and half Arabians, so they make their own profit for their own reasons. They just want to keep the farm going and be able to maintain it.   They do not charge for fan use, heated buckets automatic bug sprays in the stalls, or having the morning person put fly masks on your horse. The morning person does not usually put on or take off blankets though.    They provide hay during the winter months in the stall and out in the field and also if your horse is in the stall half the day like mine. No extra charge.  You pay for them to feed grain AM and PM (they provide it, but you can also provide your own and other supplements if needed/wanted and barn feeders will feed them whatever you want), fresh water in stalls, and a cleaned out stall.   You worm your horse yourself, bring in a farrier of your choice, and a vet of your choice.   They have a 6 acre grass field where most of the boarders horses go out on (up to 10 horses, which I think is too many due to lack of grass growth, but my horse is the easier keeper so I'm okay with that). There is another small 2 horse field if your horse needs to be more isolated.   They have two riding arenas, both with jumps, and many farming acres that has a path around it along with other trails within the woods and access to connected property that you can ride on limitedly.   Overall, I'm pretty happy with the price and the quality of grain, hay, and turnout available. I feed on occasion and am able to work off some board, but if your looking for a show barn this isn't the place to be :)"

I board my horses at my grandparents for dirt cheap, I am very thankful for that! Would not mind the $300 a month ones but they  do not have as much property to ride on!"

Horses,398h3b,ColourMePretzel,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:41:35 2015 UTC,"Around my area you start at about $400 for full care and go up from there. If you want to do rough boarding you might be able to find something at $250 or so but then you're the one doing all the feeding, you're the one doing all the cleaning, you buy all your own hay and grain, etc.  The barn I do my trail riding at is $450 a month and includes feeding hay and grain 2x a day, administration of any supplements or medications provided by owner, daily stall and paddock cleaning, night checks, daily application of fly spray provided by owner in the summer, changing of blankets if requested (we only have one horse who is blanketed), fly mask on/off if requested, use of the outdoor riding ring and round pen, use of tack locker, and 24/7 turnout weather permitting. If it's nasty out the horses come in but otherwise they only come in twice a day for breakfast and dinner. It's a very low-key backyard type barn. No trainer, no lessons, no revolving door of people and horses, no nonsense. If you start shit you get the boot.   You're probably not going to find a good indoor around here for under $600 at the lowest."

Oats and beet pulp are included in board but they will feed anything you provide. 5 acre pasture my gelding is turned out in every day with 7 other geldings, four round bales available 24/7 and a giant shelter. In the winter he goes out at dawn and comes in at dusk, right now in early summer when it's mild they come in to eat and then live outside, and once it gets extremely hot and buggy they are in during the day and out overnight.   His stall is matted, 14x18, and the barn is open concept with bars between the stalls. 100 acres of open field to ride in, a small sand ring, close knit barn family.   I pay $45 for a trim every 6 weeks, and $120 for a reset and trim when he has front shoes on. Deworming costs me about $18-$25 depending on the brand. He needs some weight and support after colicking a few months ago so this summer I'm expecting to pay an additional $200 on him per month."

Horses,398h3b,DreamRaid,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:31:10 2015 UTC,"I pay $275 a month per horse, and its a full service barn. It includes A TON. I board at an all pasture board facility, with 7 pastures and each pasture can ONLY have 5 horses. They have 1 pasture that is a rotational pasture.  They feed in these neat standing stalls. I love them. They're fed house grain twice a day (unless you buy otherwise), and every pasture also has free access to round bales and two pastures are hay 24/7. Hay is included in the price of board, and that includes any hay you take for camping or day trips.   They also have a large barn with an indoor arena, personal tack lockers, some stalls, grain room, cross ties, hay storage for square bales, and an observation area for the arena. There is an outdoor arena, obstacle course, and bridle trail that circles the property @ about 1 mile in length. There's a bathing stall outside with hot and cold water. They also have trailer parking and storage.   Every pasture has automatic waterers. My barn does not charge extra for stuff like turn out (because it's pasture board, they're turned out 24/7) or blanketing and whatnot. 99.9% of our boarders do all that themselves (blanket, fly mask) and everybody is so nice that if you needed to do something like that in a pinch, somebody would gladly do it for you. Here, though, you do have to hold your own horse for vet and farrier but again, everybody is so nice that if you can't, somebody is always willing to grab your horse for you.   I really, really love my barn! This place is also popular and there's a waitlist.   Good luck. and PS, I'm in S.E. Michigan.  Reading these other replies, I'm so happy to live in Michigan and have this awesome barn for a great price."

Horses,39776e,shmee256,3,Tue Jun 9 19:21:30 2015 UTC,"I never like adding sugar to a horse's diet because it upsets gut flora and causes energy spikes and troughs- ulcers over the long term become more likely. But the intended use is short-term, coming back to work type situations, and maybe the algae has some gut-protecting effects. At best it's extra protein, which can also be added through alfalfa and other traditional sources. At worst, it's just snake oil and a waste of money. But you wouldn't know because there is no scientific research on it regardless.  What are you trying to accomplish by changing your horse's diet, exactly?"

They're being worked 3-5 times a week and have 10hrs of grass turn out, several flakes of hay at night when they're turned in, and a substantial amount of grain. I've been giving them soy-bean meal and corn oil in addition to their grain. They're up to date on shots and worming, and otherwise healthy. They need a concentrated source of protein. I doubt I can get any more volume of feed into them."
Horses,39776e,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:56:02 2015 UTC,"What kind of feed do you give them? Can you post a photo of the crude analysis tag?   How are you working them- too much work may be turning them into lean machines (ie- look at endurance horses).  Have you had a soil/grass analysis done on your pasture or your hay as well? What breed are the youngsters- some mature late and some just aren't built to be muscular. I know you've talked to the vet, has he said anything specific?  Alfalfa and Beet pulp are good low-sugar feed options with protein in addition to bulk fiber, which is always good for horses. Soaking and rinsing is the caveat with beet pulp, but a lot of horses I know have had success with it. The soy meal is also a good addition. Please be aware that more than about 18% protein in the diet can lead to kidney disease."

Horses,393jpp,19PatchesForever89,5,Tue Jun 9 00:24:11 2015 UTC,"The gallop is a natural gait, after the walk trot and canter. The gallop involves the use of all four of the legs moving together, instead of two moving in pairs at the trot, and three moving at the canter. Most horses, as long as they are sound, can gallop.  To ask for a gallop first make sure you are in a large area, something like a field or large arena. Also be sure that the footing is solid and there will be no accidental tripping. Pick up a canter and then go into two-point position. Once in two-point release a little rein pressure, hands up the neck, and give a squeeze or a kiss. If your horse is a thoroughbred, just going into two-point will give you a gallop! If you have a lazy quarter horse, your horse may need some encouragement!  Galloping does include some speed, so make sure you are ready for it. If you're looking at a website, maybe try asking a trainer first instead, just to be sure that you're ready! :) Good luck, galloping is a lot of fun!"

Horses,38z3ua,bearxfoo,5,Mon Jun 8 01:42:21 2015 UTC,"My friend has a Grand Prix jumper who is spayed. Honestly, she is still what I'd call ""hard to handle"" so I hate to think what she was like before. It happened before she came to the US from the Netherlands so I can't tell you what the procedure itself was like. She doesn't go into heat, and she loves clover (it's got estrogen). I wonder if some of her ""quirks"" such as being allergic to her own sweat (loses hair if you don't wipe or hose her down after a ride) are due to hormone imbalances, similar to to menopausal women."
Horses,38z3ua,carbonarbonoxide,4,Mon Jun 8 02:48:13 2015 UTC,"A barn I rode at a lot as a teen had a gorgeous little mare that was a huge fucking bitch. When she was in heat she couldn't be ridden, hell, you couldn't even brush her because she was so hugely uncomfortable. Like when my mare refuses to pee at shows and then pins her ears because I dared put my leg on her at the end of the day when she was nigh to exploding...but way worse.  She'd be biting at her sides, kicking out, constantly rolling. It was classic colic symptoms due to her being so uncomfortable, plus the glorious combo of bitch mare hormones.  She was born at the barn and they let her go through years of this hoping the severity would lesson because they wanted to breed her so badly in the future. But she was a nightmare, had to be pulled out of work every time she was in heat, and was hurting and miserable. They finally ended up deciding to get her ovaries removed.  I'm not hugely familiar with the actual surgery, but I know they did the laproscopic route with her. She was back in full work within a month, and while she was still a difficult mare nobody hated her anymore because it was world's better."
Horses,38z3ua,AtomicPenny,3,Mon Jun 8 15:28:30 2015 UTC,"They are certainly safe and effective means of fixing your problem. I've met a lot of mares that have had spaying done and it basically turns them into geldings.  Have you tried other solutions first however? Simple things like 1/2 a cup of raspberry leaves a day can have a giant change in your mare. Its what Maremagic is but you can just find and buy it in bulk and its a third of the cost. Its safe, effective, and they LOVE how it tastes. You can literally just feed it out of your hand like a treat. I did that with a mare when I was younger and she mellowed out quite a bit. It took about a week or two before I noticed but it was a huge change. I'd try something like that first before surgery.   While spaying is super safe, its always dangerous to have surgery... especially for an animal like a horse. You also have risks associated like huge hormonal imbalances that can come with spaying a horse, or any animal for that matter, which will make your problem not any better. It isn't common, but it can happen. If she is calm during the winter, that is basically how she will act being spayed as long as everything goes well. Here is an article that might help you out. Shots and other types of therapies can work just as well as spaying, depending on her issue. Good luck and I hope you find the right path for your moody mare! :)"
Horses,38z3ua,daydreams356,2,Tue Jun 9 16:49:55 2015 UTC,"The barn I went to from ages 8-12 had a Welsh pony mix who was temperamental at best once the heat cycles started hitting. She was horrible under saddle, in hand, anywhere near her really. She was one of the best schooling mares, though, and they weren't ready to retire her in her prime years, so they had her spayed. For a long while she was on stall rest, just to be careful, and she ended up her old calm self, great with the kids and perfect to handle on the ground."
Horses,38z3ua,fparkyr,2,Mon Jun 8 04:55:15 2015 UTC,"I had my mare spay about 10 years ago.  she was very restless and unpredictable around other horses, would kick any thing or anyone who walked behind her, etc.  she was like this all the time.  Also would raise her tail and squirt whenever she had new horses around her.  I think the surgery gave her some measure of comfort.  there was no dramatic change in her behavior, just a little less intense.  She had her ovaries removed and they just put 2 little holes in her on both sides and that was that.  she made a full and very quick recovery.  I'm glad I did it.  I think her heat cycles were very messed up and I think it made her a little calmer, but did not change the fact that she is a kicker and very unreliable around other horses."
Horses,38z3ua,horsecrazy71,2,Tue Jun 16 21:23:17 2015 UTC,"I know a couple people who have gone the marble method and they've all been happy with the results. Though I'm not sure what the costs related to it are.  I've been having problems with my mare as well. Great in the winter, but as soon as May came around her went full drama-bitch. I started her on a magnesium supplement to help her relax and it's done really well for her. Though my girl is lovely on the ground and could be a terror under saddle.   The supplement wasn't very expensive and I thought I'd give that a shot before getting vets out for potenially expensive/unnecessary experiements. Happy with the results so far."

Horses,38z3ua,theawesomestest,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:29:01 2015 UTC,"I have thought of it, and did some research. It can be very pricey ($250 for 2.2 mg) but the biggest concern is that it can have serious side affects to the people, mainly women, who handle it. I don't think its fair to risk the health of my BO, her employees and even myself to calm my mare down, so I opt'd against it. It also has to be prescribed by a vet.   Marbles vary but the going rate is generally around $200 give or take. I'm calling MSU today to get a quote on spaying, but I've heard it can be around $1500 to $2000."
Horses,38z3ua,silver_slinky,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:35:45 2015 UTC,"Have you considered something like regumate? I'm considering putting my mare on it in the future, there are too many stallions where I board. She is crazy!  http://www.regu-mate.com/how.asp"
Horses,38z3ua,pandamonium27,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:41:40 2015 UTC,"Before you do any of that I would take her and have an ultrasound done just to make sure she doesn't have an issue. Especially considering the change in her cycles. I have know of one person who marbled and it worked well until she ejected the marble several times in quick succession. Still, that would be the thing I would try first since if it works, it's the most economical, it's reversible, and requires no chemicals. Failing that your choices are depo shots and regumate. Be aware that regumate can be administered for a week prior to a show date, which can make it a more economical option if you are showing infrequently. They also have a mechanism for admisistering it which does not require it to be poured. Rather it is deposited on the grain in the appropriate dosage via a syringe. Still, expect an extra charge from your BO for the trouble to handling it. Depo is to be administered intravenously every six or eight weeks, I'm unsure. The sticker price is cheaper than regumate but I don't know what the regulations regarding who can administer it are currently."

Horses,38xcx7,Confidence_Trickster,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:19:16 2015 UTC,That sounds really interesting! I'll be sure to check it out!
Horses,38xcx7,naphthoylindole,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:24:23 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of books titled ""101 riding exercises"" or similarly. Check amazon's book section for ""riding exercises"" and you can find tons of books. Or you can ask horse people you know if they have any books or could get you one."
Horses,38xcx7,bearxfoo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:28:03 2015 UTC,"Usually what you do with your horse is specific to their needs. For example, my mare is a Tennessee Walker. Her previous owners did not encourage her gait, in fact, they specifically wanted her to trot. I, however, do not want her to trot, so we've spent time figuring out what makes her gait. Any arena rides are generally focused on her gaiting, with some desensitization thrown in for random fun. We also do a ton of ground work, obstacle work, and lots of hand walking around the property."
Horses,38ukue,happyfriedmice,3,Sat Jun 6 23:22:14 2015 UTC,I cried and screamed as he was coming down the final stretch. When Materiality fell back and Frosted didn't move I knew he'd pull it off. I will never forget that race as long as I live. It was a beautiful thing to see a real champion at work.
Horses,38x6pk,zarallama,3,Sun Jun 7 16:35:08 2015 UTC,"Rain rot, maybe?  A vet would be able to tell for sure, and do a skin scraping to check for mites, but in the interim, my horse is super prone to rain rot, and this stuff has been great for his legs.  I use the shampoo and the moisturizing cream afterwards."
Horses,38x6pk,Confidence_Trickster,3,Sun Jun 7 17:21:20 2015 UTC,"If you have a vet coming out soon it wouldn't hurt to ask them to look. None of us are qualified to make a diagnosis. It could be fungal, bacterial, liniment burns, and I've seen horses allergic to fly sprays or even their own sweat.   Fwiw, usually mud fever is very red and oozy, looks like someone garroted the horses pasterns with piano wire and often they act lame because it's painful.   Do you leave boots on him? Or have you been using boots/wraps? It seems like it's where boots/wraps go which would make me think it's maybe a heat thing. Is there swelling, bumps, hives?  Regardless, shave the legs and keep them clean and dry. Diaper rash cream mixed with some athlete's foot cream can't hurt them. If it helps, congrats you have rain rot. If it gets worse after 3-4 days, definitely call a vet."
Horses,38x6pk,carbonarbonoxide,2,Sun Jun 7 19:08:35 2015 UTC,"In my experience mud fever usually happens on the back of the pasterns, and is always scabby and red. The pictures aren't focused well enough to tell for sure, but I'd say it's something else."
Horses,38x6pk,naphthoylindole,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:15:41 2015 UTC,"Not mud fever. Mud Fever is red and angry looking.   My money is on some kind of fungus/rain rot. I always use MTG for that kind of thing. Wash the area, and try some MTG or similar on the areas, no improvement call the vet.  If you ride him with boots/wraps make sure they're getting washed and dried regularly."

Every other horse and rider that rode in that race wanted to see AP lose because they want the fame, like last year with California Chrome. People have debated whether or not it was impossible to get a Triple Crown Winner, but honestly it just takes an exceptional horse and that doesn't come around too often."
Horses,38vw1z,Sutemos,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:16:31 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about standing when in cross ties or tied elsewhere, ground tying (drop reins, leadrope, etc and they hang out), or standing while you move around them and such (checking girth, bug spraying, etc)?  It's all has the same base of simply knowing 'whoa' and that their fidgety crap won't be tolerated and you'll kept telling them what you want, but then you progress on from there and I'm not sure what situation you are talking about."
Horses,38vw1z,AtomicPenny,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:25:19 2015 UTC,"They (Two of them) stand perfectly still while i check their legs or girth.  Or when they are prepared to be saddled up.   I was thinking more in the way ""stand here while I walk away 10 feet and come back""."
Horses,38vw1z,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:57:10 2015 UTC,"Look for tutorials on ""ground tying""- that may help. It's teaching the horse to stand without being physically restrained by crossties, a lot of Western horses are trained this way."
Horses,38vw1z,bearxfoo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:55:11 2015 UTC,"I've taught my mare a very solid ""whoa"" (I actually say ""ho"" but doesn't matter). She knows that que means stop and stand still. I can say whoa, and start to walk away. Incorporated with that, I've taught her ""stand"" or ""stand nice"". I started with these ques on her back since it's easier to begin teaching a whoa when its combined with the bit and reins. When I give a small pull back on the reins for the stop, I always included the words. She will now stop without any bit issue from just my verbal que. Once that is mastered I moved to the ground when I would get off of her, say whoa or stand and then walk away, and then call her over to me, usually with a verbal que of ""walk on"" or a simple ""come here"", to which both she responds.   Looking up info for ground tying is probably exactly what you want too, and I'd look into that."

Horses,38vh22,AtomicPenny,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:30:17 2015 UTC,"Good thought- I'm thinking European breeds like dutch warmblood, Holsteiners. Some pony breeds like Connemara and Welsh ponies, and lastly, thoroughbreds!"
Horses,38veif,flooranddoor,4,Sun Jun 7 03:55:25 2015 UTC,"Horse racing is controversial, but so are many of the extreme horse sports that push them to their limits. The top horses in any discipline are treated with great care, while those who don't make it are discarded. It's a complex issue that's not black and white, good or bad. There are lots of shades of grey: so if horse racing is bad, then is riding a horse bad? Technically they'd rather just be in pasture eating all day, are we ""forcing"" them by going on a trail? Again, it depends on where you draw that ""line."" Some people draw it at jumping, some people with horse racing, etc."
Horses,38veif,shh_im_not_here,2,Sun Jun 7 04:34:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think racing itself is bad. Most domestic horses would rather have a job, and the stereotypical thoroughbred loves to work. As a horse person, I try and respect every sport for their own skills and mastery, and this is one of the oldest ones around for horses.   The racing industry, however, does incentivize bad breeding practices by encouraging owners to breed for speed and not necessarily longevity and soundness. I posted an article recently on a study in the use of Lasix, and now the majority of racehorses are on a diuretic drug even if they aren't proven to be ""bleeders""- I think drugging anyone/thing for a condition it doesn't have is just poor management. At the lower end of the money spectrum, they breed too many mediocre horses and this produces a surplus of racing ""flops"" which end up in auctions and rescues- usually after they are injured which limits their value for second careers. I don't like the culture of sucking the horse dry and then discarding it after maybe only 15% of it's lifespan- but again, there are good owners that thoughtfully place their ex racers, and bad owners."
Horses,38veif,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:49:34 2015 UTC,"My barn owner keeps several racehorses for a client during the off season. He treats them well. I cannot speak for how racehorses are treated in general, though."
Horses,38veif,battlemage999,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:28:48 2015 UTC,"It depends.  I dont have any first hand Experience, just stories I've heard.  In my opinion its good, its the people who make it bad.  They push the horses that cleary dont want to go and in the end you get a 6 year old horse who is practicaly broken, with legs destroyed and very nervous.  But I could be wrong, and probably am, there are some owners and trainers that ""do the right thing"".  But in general i would say that its more bad than good."
Horses,38veif,Sutemos,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:44:33 2015 UTC,"Horse racing can be bad or it can be good.   Horses break down and die suddenly sometimes, although that's very rare and if the horse has been properly examined by a vet and cared for it's highly unlikely to happen, but it still does. Horses that don't make any money on the smaller tracks might have unfortunate ends, but a lot of them are sold fairly cheaply now before they even start racing.  Just like any activity with an animal, there are good and bad owners. You hear a lot more about bad owners than good owners, so it might sound worse than it is.   People drop dead in sports all the time, break legs, get injuries. Some people seem to think this is worse when it happens to animals(can't provide consent most would argue), although a horse that's never been raced can have as many injuries as a race horse. It depends on the situation, there are bad dog owners, bad football coaches, bad horse trainers. Can't hate on a whole sport because of a few bad people."

On foot, walking I can't keep up with him on the way to the ring, and when he wins he gets all collected and fancy, but when he loses, or even when he's just walking back after a round he drags his feet and you feel like you're dragging a sack of potatoes back to the stall."

Horses,38pmum,Synaxis,3,Sat Jun 6 04:38:56 2015 UTC,"Just a moment in time, rollkur is almost the exact opposite of what a saddleseat rider wants their horse to do and is never used even in training. Saddleseat horses are ridden with very high head carriage regardless of breed and they cannot tuck their noses to the vertical or behind it while maintaining the high head carriage."
Horses,38pmum,Sawfeather,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:20:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering :) at first glance I saw dressage and then saw it was saddle seat and I googled to look but didn't see anything like it. Photographer myself and I know I got crap for a photo I liked but the horse had a harsh bit. I got a ton of crap over it, like what kind of photographer post this? Uhh me. I'm a photographer, not my job to say what rider should and shouldn't be doing, at a 4 star event no less. Sorry for the rant but I'm not trying to put the photographer off or rider at fault. So any ways that's why I threw out maybe it's just an angle thing or a moment they caught."
Horses,38pmum,Synaxis,2,Sat Jun 6 16:10:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is a case of just a moment in time. I'm at a saddle seat show as we speak, this is my discipline. The noses are never pulled in to the chest by a rider but they can absolutely do it themselves."

Do not just grab one and think that bonding, and love, and midnight story time will show them how wonderful you are and lead to some fabulous connection.  Someone will get hurt.  Definitely get a trainer. As far as boarding goes make sure communication is completely open and honest about what you plan on bringing in their barn, but training board is definitely a viable option. Many trainers absolutely welcome the owners to participate,  but until basic ground manners are taught your participation may simply be watching and listening."
Horses,38nxi7,AtomicPenny,3,Fri Jun 5 13:50:34 2015 UTC,"Hey! BLM Mustang lover here. There are a lot of programs to help you out!   First of all, you don't need to be an experienced trainer but having basics is important. The horses are wild and take some time to gentle and to start under saddle. If you pick out a horse from a facility you will see a lot that are quite friendly and will be as easy as domestic horses, however. Many of the horses born on the facility from captured mares are really, really tame and will walk right up to you and let you pet them. At the Extreme Mustang Makeover, VERY young kids handle and train their own 2 year olds... most of which are horses born on the lots.  However, if this is too much for you there are three programs for you to consider. First is the mustang makeover program. If you go to the auction, you will have some amazing horses up for bid for really low prices. These are handled, mostly saddle broke, and usually nearly bombproof. At my last EMM, the most amazing horse we had sold for $1,500 and some REALLY nice mounts sold for about $400.  A second option for you is the TIP program. You work with a trainer who will gentle the horse for you. You only pay the $125 adoption fee, they get paid $700, you get a gentled horse who trailers/picks up feet/halters, and everyone wins.   The third option is working with a prison inmate program. Here in Colorado at the Canon City Holding facility, inmates will train a horse all the way to saddle broke. For saddle broke you pay about $1000 but for about $300 you can get a gentled horse who trailers. You can even pick out your own horse and send them through the program.  I LOVE mustangs and know a lot about them, so if you have ANY questions please ask!!    If you are an English rider, trail rider, western rider, anything.... these horses are AWESOME. I can show you a ton of amazing dressage and eventer Mustangs. These are smart and wonderful horses that have no comparison.  If you are an English rider, check out Elissa Wallace and her mounts (especially Hwin who is now eventing) to see how awesome these guys can be! Here is Elissa and Hwin at their EMM event freestyle    Here is the fan favorite from the Colorado EMM. Loved Lilo! Its amazing how far these horses come in just 100 days. Plenty of amateur trainers there too who did a wonderful job! The facility at this EMM was crap for new horses (versus the wonderful facilities of years past)... it was held at a HUGE and busy event so was overwhelming for these babies! However, I'm so proud of how everyone did regardless. Most horses handled it super awesome."
Horses,38nxi7,daydreams356,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:47:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for these great comments! I have always enjoyed watching the makeovers, but as a dog trainer who rides horses I am of the mind slow and steady...My mom is from a town where they have BLM roundup pens and I've always wanted to adopt one of the mustangs I saw there. Earlier this week I was browsing the adoption page for TIP and fell in love with the look of a strawberry roan gelding with a wide blaze on his beautiful face. I don't have training experience outside of observing and jumping in to help desensitize some feral horses, so I certainly am not qualified to do it myself. I didn't know if creating that bond with the horse while they are in that fearful state was better than being handed off to someone more experienced at training at first and then introducing me as the ""person"" while horse continues into a more thorough gentling."
Horses,38nxi7,daydreams356,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:44:30 2015 UTC,The TIP program is great. Certainly look into that if you want one. Often you can ask a trainer to continue working with them to saddle broke and they will for a decently priced fee. They already know the horse's querks so can work with them faster than an outside trainer.  And is the roan you are looking at this one?
Horses,38nxi7,daydreams356,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:16:28 2015 UTC,Whoops! I was basing it off the photo I saw earlier this week--strawberry roan ain't the right color at all. This is the man!
Horses,38nxi7,Hunterx700,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:03:20 2015 UTC,He was my favorite of the bunch as well! You have good taste. I was going to say the other roan looks like he will be for a more advanced rider to start though I'm sure he has settled well since the video.
Horses,38nxi7,daydreams356,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:40:37 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to add that theres also a separate inmate training program where they take mustangs, spend about 4 months training them, 6-7 hours a day 5 days a week, and then auction them off. Thats where i got my boy and so far he's proven to be everything i've wanted from a horse. The one i went to was in Carson City, Nevada and i'm not sure where others are and there are any others"
Horses,38nxi7,misskinky,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:47:32 2015 UTC,"I know! I mentioned it above for the third option! :) The inmate program where you pick a horse is the same as the ones they sell off. There are varying programs in the US, and most are great. Thats the best option for those who don't have experience, though I've heard both good and bad things about the outcomes. They are pretty stuck to their ways on how they train as most do not have horse experience so only know what they've been taught there. Some methods don't work for some horses and those don't do well in the program. Most are great, however.   ""The third option is working with a prison inmate program. Here in Colorado at the Canon City Holding facility, inmates will train a horse all the way to saddle broke.

Horses,38i3ge,Charlottecello,17,Thu Jun 4 10:47:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, this horse is completely unfazed... Wait... I don't know whether that is the right response if there is someone with a chain saw chasing you... :) I think personally I'd opt for a different reaction."
Horses,38i3ge,monkeybusiness127,10,Thu Jun 4 12:37:24 2015 UTC,haha seriously  A kick to the face of a chainsaw wielding maniac that's chasing you around really wouldn't be an over-the-top reaction
Horses,38i3ge,AtomicPenny,9,Thu Jun 4 14:02:17 2015 UTC,"LOVE this!  When I worked trail rides, we had to usher wild life off the trail sometimes. Including bears. I have high expectations for ""bomb proofing""."
Horses,38i3ge,DLCoopaTroop,5,Thu Jun 4 18:31:05 2015 UTC,"This is impressive, especially in the arena. That said, you should expose your horse to everything imaginable. The first time I rode my 3 year old mare on the trail solo, went through a forest area that had a managed fire the day before. Trees were still flaming and there was smoke everywhere. She handled it like a champ!"
Horses,38i3ge,gnossos_p,11,Thu Jun 4 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"I was completely annoyed with the fact that I spent 60 seconds of my time watching such a ""brave"" horse that it could canter around with a couple umbrellas so I skipped ahead and there was a nutjob chasing it with a chainsaw and I about near laughed up a lung."
Horses,38i3ge,numberjack,5,Thu Jun 4 20:10:18 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know how you can tap into this kind of connection and partnership with your horse? Do bombproofing clinics really work?  Both of my lease horses have been spooking, explosive messes lately and they can get a little too dangerous for me to want to just ride it out.  I know I have to do my best to stay quiet and not get tense but it's tough when I'm afraid of getting hurt.   How do you build up to what this horse and rider are demonstrating in the video?"
Horses,38i3ge,RonRonner,17,Thu Jun 4 14:09:10 2015 UTC,"Consistency and repetition. Continually expose them to things and stay level headed and calm while doing so. You are with him, so he's safe and there's no reason to be upset or scared. They will slowly gather more confidence in their own right but for the nervous dudes you become the rock that makes it ok. Don't react and go with the ""you're ok - see you're fine - it's all right"" type of reactions, you just give them conformation that that really is scary. Steady, kind of just ignore it and continue, and they'll realize that you don't think anything is wrong so it can't be that bad.  A local place was holding a clinic and the barn owner asked if I'd give them my gelding as a demo horse. I was boarding him there over the winter for the indoor and giving lessons in exchange, so figured what the hell, it's something new and would keep me in the owner's good graces. My boy is very hot, and quite reactive, but generally holds it together really well because I ask him to, and he likes working, likes his job, and wants to do well. I can feel the inner turmoil a lot of the time, but he sticks it out and does a great job. The clinician (whose name I can't remember for the life of me) had me do scary things, gelding didn't give a shit. Had me hold my horse while he did scary things, gelding didn't give a shit. Had me leave the ring, and then did scary things. The noises (cracking lunge whip, banging things, etc) he completely ignored. When he picked up scary things and came near him he did a quick scan, called for me, and then lost his shit when he realized he was alone and the objects were going to murder him for sure. Odd boy."
Horses,38i3ge,AtomicPenny,4,Thu Jun 4 14:25:19 2015 UTC,"Aw, that's a sweet story!  Thank you for the advice, it definitely makes sense.  I can't blame them for freaking when I'm not stepping up to the plate to tell them everything's cool.  I know they don't understand it's them I'm afraid of and not the fox playing on the hill outside the ring!"
Horses,38i3ge,RonRonner,7,Thu Jun 4 14:27:36 2015 UTC,"Groundwork. Over and over and over. Also, spending time with your horse, in general, to build a relationship and bond. You have to gain their trust, they have to believe that you're going to protect them from the evil, scary things.   I do enjoy the bombproofing clinics, I think they build more of a relationship between you and your horse than really desensitizing them. The more they trust you, the more willing they are to do something you're asking."
Horses,38i3ge,bearxfoo,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:49:25 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you! Ground work and quality time are both things I need to dedicate more time to, for sure."
Horses,38i3ge,RonRonner,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:31:36 2015 UTC,I like Clinton Anderson's method of desensitizing horses. There are a lot of good videos on youtube if you get a chance to look them up :)
Horses,38i3ge,theawesomestest,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:37:30 2015 UTC,Will do! Thanks!
Horses,38i3ge,RonRonner,2,Thu Jun 4 16:38:23 2015 UTC,"I really like Clinton Anderson but my issue with him is that he trains desensitizing to a stop--releasing the pressure when they stop moving their feet.   I just acquired a horse that had that done until she was dull--and she still freaked constantly and bucked her previous owner off! :) She had been taught to stop moving her feet when something was scary, and stuck feet create a bronc.   I really like Buck Brannaman's groundwork. He uses a flag and desensitizing to movement--releasing the pressure when their feet move forward in a relaxed manner. I have not had one issue with my horse once I started using the flag and getting her to walk along with the flag flapping everywhere.   You can still definitely use Clinton's desensitizing, I'm not saying it's not incredibly useful, but just be aware that it can create problems. It also takes a lot longer to desensitize to a stop rather than desensitize to a walk. :)"
Horses,38i3ge,DreamRaid,2,Fri Jun 5 02:38:49 2015 UTC,"Groundwork, repetition, high expectations.  A lot of people have already responded, so I don't want to be a parrot.  By ""high expectations"", I mean that the horse should be focused on you first, and listen regardless of outside distractions. I recently took a class with Buck Brannaman's daughter, and she stressed the importance of this. You can let them smell and look at the scary thing as much as you want, but it's better to carry on as normal because unless they're listening to you, smelling it doesn't matter.   Obviously every horse and situation is different, so do what's best and safest for you and your horse.  Some more sacking out and ground work near problem areas could help."
Horses,38i3ge,DLCoopaTroop,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:26:29 2015 UTC,"That's a good call, thank you! One of them is a space cadet Arab who I think really would benefit from the higher expectations.  She's a sweet mare who I wouldn't really describe as alpha (and she's not overtly disrespectful and certainly never aggressive) but she's basically lacking submission, in the sense that she would rather do her own thing and get wrapped up in her own head than listen to what I have to say.  If I get after her a little to zone her back in,  she just gets more worked up.  She reminds me of a Tennessee Williams' southern belle with the vespers.  She's very dramatic and prone to histrionics.  I've been longeing her though and I think just the principle of making her move her feet while I stay put has helped.  I should really do more groundwork for sure.  The big guy is just a worrier who goes into panic mode.  It's tough to get through to him once his mind goes, he just whites out.  He had gotten pretty good at checking in with me before he'd panic but I fell off of him this winter after a good, hard spook and we're both working back to where we were.  Thank you again, it helps to hear these things from different perspectives!"
Horses,38i3ge,RonRonner,2,Thu Jun 4 18:36:29 2015 UTC,"Oh I know how that goes! Both the falling off breaking confidence and the mare who is prone to hysterics and would rather do her own thing. My mare is a thoroughbred and the same way, and we spent the first 6 months of my owning her just trying to trot a circle.  She's prone to using spooking as an excuse for attitude.  Another tip (that my trainer drilled in to me for months) was that you can ride most anything as long as it's forward. My mare likes to hang out behind my leg, and if I'm not strict and let her stay there, it's way easier for her to throw a fit and buck me off. It's terribly counter intuitive and scary, but making them go forward through the craziness makes a world of difference.   Now anytime my mare starts with the sass, we go forward. She's since realized it's way easier to behave than do laps around the arena."
Horses,38i3ge,DLCoopaTroop,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:49:59 2015 UTC,"I'll give that a try tonight, thank you!  Thank goodness for her long mane, it's been an oh-shit strap more than once ;)"
Horses,38i3ge,RonRonner,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:51:11 2015 UTC,Sometimes spookiness is just because they have a lot of extra energy and that makes them want to bolt at the slightest provocation. Weather changes also make my boys act like the whole world looks different.   Try lunging your horse for a bit before riding to see if it gets some of the spazzes out.
Horses,38i3ge,DystopiaNoir,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:19:23 2015 UTC,"Excellent point, thank you! With the Arab, there's just no hitting the bottom of her energy but you can definitely see her eye soften after she gets some of the nervous energy out.  The big guy isn't being silly so much as he genuinely freaks himself out but longeing seems to help him too."
Horses,38i3ge,RonRonner,2,Thu Jun 4 18:38:24 2015 UTC,"My horse now is an Arab (and former endurance racer) and I completely agree. I don't think he can ever be tired. During the winter, however, he is a spooking/bolting machine. So far this spring/summer he has done nothing but jump a little at a noise."
Horses,38i3ge,daydreams356,9,Thu Jun 4 18:47:52 2015 UTC,"I never ever see dressage riders taking the time to train their horses like this. Ever. Its always ""arena arena piaffe passage now circles more circles train train train stay in your stall"" This was extremely refreshing to see."

Horses,38frxh,AtomicPenny,3,Thu Jun 4 09:33:13 2015 UTC,"Crossbred Friesians are cheaper, and sometimes prettier :D (from a biased owner of one). Weanling/unbroke is cheapest, sometimes you can gets a steal from a well-known breeder/stallion. Just make sure it is always registered to prove  the heritage. Purebred Friesians have a lot of health issues compared to other breeds, crossing dilutes some of that."

They'll work really well and then have enough laziness in there that they're not spooky or full of bucks and bolts.

Horses,38d2ex,AtomicPenny,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:08:17 2015 UTC,"The ideal foal is usually a perfect 50/50 melding of the parents. But some form of this is what my mind keeps going to haha  Anything that can help balance out the fact that a friesian is a carriage horse and give it some conformation adjustments better suited to be an undersaddle horse is a cross I'm all for. The friesians and crosses are a big ""in"" thing though (as all breeds are at some point I suppose) and the ones I've worked with were simply around because they're black, fluffy, and statuesque...they certainly weren't in any way suited for the jobs their owners wanted them for. The akhel-teke is hugely opposite and a perfect melding would really be a huge balance to both (although still far more high headed than I would find ideal except for maybe a dressage mount or lower level jumper), hence my curiosity. Like the arabs or tb with the straight draft crosses, very opposite, but I'm a big fan of the sturdy athletic babies most of those churn out.  Friesian/Teke.....it'll go really good or really bad!"

Horses,38fit0,iamfizzly,5,Wed Jun 3 21:42:17 2015 UTC,"Groundwork! Everyone is so quick to jump on their back, but you can get so much accomplished from the ground. I like the idea of ""playing"" with the horse on the ground too, teaching them boundaries, and building trust by going over obstacles, even teaching them things using food reward.   Each horse is an individual when it comes to adjustment, some take a few weeks while others could care less about a new environment. My advice is take things at your horse's pace, they'll let you know if you're pushing too hard too fast."
Horses,38fit0,shh_im_not_here,3,Thu Jun 4 18:03:26 2015 UTC,"Perfect, I don't even have a saddle yet as I've been horse shopping and figured the saddle could come after the horse.  I did purchase a bunch of grooming materials though, so I think I will take it slow with him - lots of attention and grooming, while also doing groundwork exercises to build our relationship and get to know one another!  Thank you!"
Horses,38fit0,carbonarbonoxide,3,Thu Jun 4 21:48:45 2015 UTC,"Spend lots of time just hanging out- grooming sessions are great. You will figure out where his tickly places are, if he likes it ""rough"" or has thin skin, if there are any ground manners you need to work on later. I always liked to feed mine personally for the first month or so (I have to board until we find some affordable land) so they know is their person."
Horses,38c1hq,Shawmee,5,Wed Jun 3 06:30:28 2015 UTC,"Yep! 4' of crusty icy shit that you can't walk through let alone work in? Not to mention the horrors that is manure control since you can't roll a cart around.  No thanks!  It will come back around soon enough, but I definitely don't miss it when it's gone."
Horses,38c1hq,AtomicPenny,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:23:56 2015 UTC,Though where I'm living now sometimes I'll take the snow over the ridiculous amounts of mud that comes with the winters in my current location.  Summer and fall are my favourites..

Horses,38fzon,greengryphon,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:33:58 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much traveling and how often you intend to be gone. If it's longer than a week and more than once a month or two, I'd definitely board at a reputable facility. If it's like a week or two out of the year, not such a big deal- you could probably find someone from a local barn that would like to make a little cash. I would definitely not go the family route, because if something happens, it can get ugly and unless they're horse people, they won't be as likely to pick up on something like cellulitis or colic nor as motivated to clean stalls and feed on time as paid help.  If you want to do long-term travel (months+ at a time), I'd probably just hold off on buying a horse until you're done.  I travel a lot for work (in bursts and lulls)- last November I was in Germany, China and Singapore, and home for maybe 7 days that month. I couldn't do it without my boarding stable. I trusted a friend to look after my barrel horses for two weeks, and came back to a foot puncture from a ripped shoe with swelling up to the knee, they were all crusty with sweat and the beginnings of rain rot, the stalls hadn't been cleaned but maybe twice in two weeks. My barn has a head trainer and two assistant trainers, as well as 3-4 grooms and the horses are supervised by a person about 20 hours out of the day (night watch sleeps from about midnight til 4am). I can rest easy knowing that if anything happens, the vet will be the first call and I will be the next, and with all those experienced eyes, nothing will be missed. The assistant trainer also keeps my horse fit while I'm gone, which is important because I enjoy competing.   That said, if you just have a trail/""general purpose"" horse you piddle around on, you probably don't need the training- just someone with experience who is responsible enough to feed on time and knows how to call you, the vet, and the farrier if something is not quite right."
Horses,38fzon,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:49:09 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what hired barn managers are for. :) what you described is pretty much exactly what I am working toward. A home base farm, but traveling 1/3-1/2 of the year. However if you just want a horse or two, you should board them. Unfortunately I can't give more experienced advice, but that's what I plan to do"

Horses,38c0qf,flofromproggresive,4,Wed Jun 3 06:22:01 2015 UTC,"Depends. I always give my horse a day off after a show and after the day long trail adventures.  My guys are fit with no health or soundness issues and are generally fine with that amount of R&R time.  Older or younger horses I would stretch it, soundness issues I would be extremely cautious, the weather and heat can play a role. Basically you just need to be very mindful of your individual horse and how they are feeling and not worry about a specific rule."
Horses,38c0qf,AtomicPenny,3,Wed Jun 3 11:40:29 2015 UTC,"It depends on your horse, really. I trail ride on the weekends and ride at the barn during the week. Some weekends I will ride both Saturday & Sunday. I might give my mare Monday off or I might come and ride lightly after work. Some weekends I only ride one day and then a couple days later during the week. If I'm camping I might ride every day I'm there (usually a long extended weekend, Thursday to Monday or so).  If your horse is in shape, no health issues, well fitted tack, most horses can be ridden continuously within reason (like a camping trip). Some get sore and need a day or two in between. Keep an eye on your horse and you'll know what they can and can't handle."
Horses,38c0qf,bearxfoo,2,Wed Jun 3 13:34:47 2015 UTC,"Mine doesn't always get a ""day off"" after shows, per se. She doesn't work, but I'll hop on bareback and mosey around the fields at a walk in the afternoon. I do this because she gets AM only turnout and if she sits in the stall all afternoon after a hard weekend at a show, she stocks up. If your horse is outside a lot, they probably move enough so you're good.   And you know how when you're sore from a workout, you actually feel better moving around a bit? Light movement helps to work the lactic acid out of the muscles."
Horses,38c0qf,carbonarbonoxide,2,Wed Jun 3 15:48:59 2015 UTC,"Good point on the stocking up and stiffness. Mine get full day turnout and there's generally enough scary things happening that they have periodic ""real"" movement throughout the day instead of just aimless wandering and eating. If they're inside more (or are lazy as fuck) I definitely agree that you should dedicate time to be sure there is actual movement and stretching going on even if you don't work them."
Horses,38c0qf,AtomicPenny,4,Wed Jun 3 17:24:27 2015 UTC,From endurance folk I always hear for every 10 miles of trail covered you give them a day of rest. So 50 miles would be 5 days of rest.
Horses,38c0qf,fishwithfeet,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:20:49 2015 UTC,"It probably depends on his condition, how you feed after a long ride to get him fully rested, as well as other factors.   I'd talk to my trainer and see if they can advise you or even your vet to see his condition status."
Horses,3897ka,Molly_Wobbles,27,Tue Jun 2 18:46:51 2015 UTC,"Can you put it in containers that lock?  I know it's a pain, but I used to have to do that at the barn I boarded at.  I had a metal trash can and I ran a chain through the handles and padlocked it so nobody could take the lid off.  Just an idea.  Don't know what else to suggest other than a locked room.  BTW,  where are these children's parents??  I would talk with them as well.  Most especially, the ones you all have caught in action.  Let them know they will be responsible for any vet bills resulting from feeding horses feed they aren't supposed to have.  (Not sure how you could really enforce that, but just throwing it out there)"
Horses,3897ka,gidget106,8,Tue Jun 2 19:01:09 2015 UTC,I second this. I don't ride horses but can understand the worry of horses getting the wrong feed. Locking containers might just be the best and only option. Just make three copies of the keys so all the employees have one.
Horses,3897ka,RagnodOfDoooom,4,Tue Jun 2 19:30:39 2015 UTC,"We just replaced some of the bins so I'm not sure my boss would want to get another set of them, but using a chain on at least the sweet feed bin sounds like a great idea.  Unfortunately, we have no rules about parents sticking around so some of the kids (there's quite a few) just get dropped off for lessons/ to run around for a couple of hours. We've talked to the parents we could find, but we're still on the lookout for the rest of them."
Horses,3897ka,KimberlyInOhio,3,Wed Jun 3 02:22:21 2015 UTC,Yep. Lock the bins.
Horses,3897ka,shh_im_not_here,2,Tue Jun 2 20:53:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed! Maybe where I live people are untrustworthy, but absolutely everyone's supplements are in a locked container. Locks keep honest people honest as they say."
Horses,3897ka,carbonarbonoxide,2,Tue Jun 2 22:21:47 2015 UTC,"We used broken deep freezers. You can bolt latches and padlock those suckers shut tight. Bonus, keeps mice and birds and bugs out."
Horses,3897ka,RonRonner,19,Wed Jun 3 01:29:33 2015 UTC,"Parents.  Any child caught wandering off path or abusing privileges is no longer permitted on premises without a parent's supervision.  Any continued issues, the child is asked not to return.  Lesson kids pay money for the privilege of being taught how to ride in a safe environment.  Boarders pay money for the privilege of knowing their horses are being cared for properly and in a safe environment.  These kids literally need to be put on a leash or you're endangering your boarding business.  I can't see any other way around it, and I used to co-run a lesson and boarding business.  I grew up as a barn brat hanging around the lesson barn all day and helped raise up lots of other wonderful barn brats.  It's an incredible way to learn and I understand that kids get excited but anything that a child does that endangers a horse's or human's health is a stop, go to jail, do not collect $200 moment.  Nobody wants to board at a barn where kids are running amok, it's a HUGE liability."
Horses,3897ka,Yummy_Chewy_Scrumpy,9,Tue Jun 2 20:05:35 2015 UTC,"OMG.  Cannot fathom this happening.  If possible, have the feed locked up either in a bin, or a sign on the feed room door that says authorized personnel only.  If possible, call a barn meeting that emphasizes the danger in proceeding this way, not to mention that feed is not FREE to begin with.  If anyone is caught, threaten that they are suspended from riding for a week, or something to that affect??  I would be LIVID if this was me, so I hope that you find a solution soon."
Horses,3897ka,misskinky,10,Tue Jun 2 20:01:27 2015 UTC,"Lock the container, and put a sign directly on the container that says ""do not feed this to any horses. Staff only. Anybody found giving this to ANY horse will be responsible for vet bills."" Also, is it possible to have a meeting with each kid and explain why it is dangerous? Like, maybe make it instructor policy to mention it at the beginning of every lesson for the next week or two, just long enough that you can be sure every kid will hear it at least once.   Edit: just had a somewhat funny idea but it could work... Put a sign on the feed saying ""this feed is being watched by camera and all non-staff members who touch feed will be held responsible."" Or something like that. You don't need any actual camera... Just something that looks convincingly like a camera somewhere in the room. Ha. People (especially kids) are much more likely to do bad things if they think nobody will see them; this could prevent that?"
Horses,3897ka,misskinky,3,Tue Jun 2 20:55:39 2015 UTC,"I just had another possibly stupid or possibly creative idea. Any chance you could fence off the alcove with a baby gate with a sign saying staff only? Clearly it wouldn't be enough to stop somebody who is determined, but it might be just enough of a barrier to make it clear ""you are not allowed here!"" Plus it might be more convenient than having to deal with locks and keys, and tall enough staff members could just step over. They even make baby gates with doors in them haha but I don't think you wanted an exspensive solution"
Horses,3897ka,theawesomestest,7,Tue Jun 2 21:46:19 2015 UTC,"How does your barn communicate with the kids, facebook email? Call people if you have to to let them know that this is very serious and put punishments in place for anyone who is caught feeding the horses?"
Horses,3897ka,Finalsaredun,3,Tue Jun 2 19:10:42 2015 UTC,"Simplest solution is simply to lock the container the feed is in. Harder solution is to actually block off the entire alcove with a lockable gate or barn door or something similar.   Why are all these children running around inside the barn where there is presumably no riding happening? And I don't mean in a ""where are the parents?"" capacity, but why are the barn owners allowing them to run everywhere when it is obviously causing a big problem?   You boarders need to speak up and voice your dislike at all of this! Including the kid who entered your horse's stall. A kid entering a random horse's stall, talk about liability! Let the barn owners know that they have a boarding side of their business as well as riding lessons, and that they need to fix this before a horse or a kid gets hurt. They could ban all children under the age of X from the barn/stall area unless accompanied by parents, for example."
Horses,3897ka,Diamondbj,5,Wed Jun 3 05:35:42 2015 UTC,"How old are the kids doing this? If they're on the younger side they should be with an adult or older kid that is more advanced. If they're 4th-8th grade kids then a stern talking to from an instructor should do the trick.   Lock the container if need be, and keep up with the signs. If the instructors are willing, have them take time to teach the kids about feed as part of a 'horsemanship lesson'... Maybe include a little bit about medicine too or something like that. I have seen many students, even younger ones, get excited to learn about taking care of horses even with the monotonous stuff."
Horses,3897ka,zerachechiel,2,Tue Jun 2 19:32:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely lock feed up. Call barn meeting to discuss with parents & kids. Put alarm (something annoying like a cookie jar alarm) on feed to alert staff when someone goes in grain. Also, educate all members that it may be harmful to some horses, in layman's terms tell them it can be like a diabetic & sugar. If they are kids, im sure they arent ill intended. But scare the bejesus out of them & kick out eventually"
Horses,3897ka,spellboundsilk92,2,Tue Jun 2 22:03:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe make a rule that children must stay in a certain area outside the barn and can't enter the barn without an adult/supervisor with them? And put up ""DO NOT FEED HORSES, ANYONE SEEN FEEDING HORSES WITHOUT PERMISSION WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE""signs everywhere."
Horses,3897ka,dunmorestriden,2,Wed Jun 3 00:42:52 2015 UTC,Put a sign on your stable door saying 'do not feed'. I would also find the parents and have a word with them about their little darlings and how expensive a vet bill could be for them if the horse was harmed by anything it was given.

Horses,385kw5,Traceyt715,5,Tue Jun 2 02:56:19 2015 UTC,I once had to pull over and yak because I had a human hair in my breakfast on the way to school.

Horses,386am9,NYCHCP,12,Tue Jun 2 03:53:39 2015 UTC,"I will never support a campaign which intends to put well cared for horses out of a job and a useful life and risks them winding up in unsavory situations, such as in a kill pen or in front of an Amish plow.  The biggest supporters of the carriage horse ban seem to never actually be horse people. Why is that? Why is it that I can count on one hand the number of horse people I personally know who think the carriages should be banned from NYC completely? Hmm. Strange.  Maybe it's because most horse people recognize that those horses are very well cared for and actually have a fairly easy job that gives their lives some security and some purpose?"

Horses,37z68b,Puddock,9,Sun May 31 17:18:38 2015 UTC,"What kind of horse?  I'm always surprised when people post these shots with the reins so loose (I see you have them twisted in the throatlatch). Maybe I am just way too paranoid haha, but I tie those up like the horses are going to try their hardest to get a leg into it or flip them over their head. My guys also really stretch down on the lunge so that's going to promote sliding right there."
Horses,37z68b,AtomicPenny,1 point,Sun May 31 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, I'm going to guess she's a Welsh A but she looks to have a bit of something else in her.  I'd never leave her unsupervised like this, because I don't trust her an inch when my back is turned. I've never had them slip or pose a problem before; I think they're actually a bit more secure than they look in the picture, as I always check before I lunge her that they can't come over her head and that they can't slip sideways enough for her to get a foot in. I think in the photo, she's stretched out and the reins have slipped as far as they are going to towards the inside (I think they're tight on the outside). I mean, all of this said, you've got an excellent point - I should really be less lazy and take the reins off the bridle."
Horses,37z68b,daydreams356,0,Sun May 31 19:42:27 2015 UTC,If you loop them like this through the throatlatch and twisted the way she has its nearly impossible for them to snag a rein. It won't move much at all. Its no different then having a guide rope around their neck.
Horses,37z68b,AtomicPenny,3,Mon Jun 1 00:02:23 2015 UTC,"The things I have seen them manage put getting those reins low enough to get a leg in a cakewalk - I definitely don't think it's ""nearly impossible"", far from it. I choose to tie it up differently, and I wouldn't lunge with a guide rope.  Other people clearly feel differently and choose to do it another way. To each their own, some things just surprise me when I see how other people do them, just as I am sure people would be surprised how I do some things."
Horses,37z68b,daydreams356,-1,Mon Jun 1 00:36:37 2015 UTC,"If it is done properly, yea its pretty hard to happen. I think there is a point when people overthink these things a bit. Thats like saying they'll get their legs caught on loose sidereins... which is a lot more likely. Have you ever heard of that happening though? Horse's legs don't really move the way they'd need to to get in reins done up on their neck."
Horses,37z68b,AtomicPenny,2,Mon Jun 1 06:00:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing at all, I fully admit to thinking a lot of these things through to horrible conclusions. Maybe it's the engineer in me lol - always design for a margin of safety!  But like I said, I've seen some shit. Like that jumper (whose name escapes me at the moment, I'll have to look it up) that got his shoe caught in the martingale attachment at his girth twice in like a weeks time. I've never considered that a possibility, but they manage some weird shit. I have seen a horse get his legs up through sidereins. A girl at the barn was lunging her guy, they were longish but properly set for his build and skill, he stumbled, and bwoop, the impossible happened seamlessly enough.  His reaction was thankfully to stand there going ""Mom! Something's wrong!"" and she was able to rush over and unhook it a moment before he tried jumping away from the monster that was grabbing his leg.  So it didn't end badly at all, but it could have.....and that's basically the essence of everything with the horses. They're the perfect example of Murphy's Law and have an ability to get themselves in some weird ass situations and injure themselves in remarkably stupid ways.  Like people letting horses graze with the leadrope trailing around on the ground. I was always told as a kid to keep it off the ground. They'll step on it, snap their head up, break the leadrope or halter, and then you've got a loose horse on your hands. Explanation made sense to me, it takes very little effort to hold it up, and I've seen countless horses racing around at shows because of that exact scenario. Or the pole stock gates a ton of places have that I'll never use. Or feeding hay off pallets like I saw on here. Or other random stuff that I wouldn't do that other people have done for decades with no problem. I see it going badly, have other alternatives that seem less iffy to me, so do it my way.  Other people can do it there way. Is what it is. Not everything is right or wrong.  A lot of stuff I consider them doing has a very slim chance of actually happening, but can be easily prevented or given even better odds against it by doing something slightly different or putting an ounce more effort into my end of it. So I do it just because. If my paranoia eliminates one injury, one bad experience, or one piece of busted equipment then so be it, that sounds good to me. Because they're still going to manage that with other stuff that I never considered to be dangerous or upsetting in any way, because they're magical injury attracting creatures!"
Horses,37z68b,AtomicPenny,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:46:20 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. I'm still a newbie really; this is how her owner lunges her, so this is how I've been taught and is how I lunge her. I'm not trying to pass the buck, it's just that I've yet to experience anybody having issues with side reins or tied reins so it's never occurred to me to do it differently. In order for her to catch her reins, she would have to trip. It could happen, and I'm not actually prepared for that; even though it's only a slight chance there's really no reason I can't take the reins off just in case.  For the most part, I employ common sense. I don't leave ropes trailing, I don't let a tacked-up horse out of my hands, I don't leave halters on unnecessarily. I wear a helmet. When people give me good reasons, I listen. I don't want you to think I'm some sort of crazy, careless lazy person who risks other people's horses. I really, genuinely, try to be sensible and diligent. And I really, genuinely, thought twisting the reins was the done thing, and was safe.  A few months ago, my first ever part lease, an irish cob called Leo, colicked and died. His large intestine just flipped over, prolapsed and died, for no good reason, and there was nothing anybody could do about it. I've been riding for only 2 and a bit years, and had been leasing him for about 4 months prior to this event. I constantly wonder and fret about my lack of inexperience as a contributing factor to his death. If I didn't have a great bunch of friends at the yard supporting me, reassuring me and encouraging me, I probably would have fretted myself out of the horse world by now. This pony belongs to Leo's owner. She lets me exercise her to keep my confidence and groundwork skills up.  I'm just giving you context because I want you to know I'm taking what you say on board because I agree with you; and because I don't want to give you the impression that I am careless. I'm just inexperienced (and that still scares the shit out of me).  Actually, forget the horses, I fret so much it's a wonder I haven't done myself an injury. :/"
Horses,37z68b,spasticpez,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:32:47 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to make you feel like a terrible person or anything - please don't take it that way! Tying up reins like you were shown is super common. And everything we do at some point is because that's what we were told to do. ""Hold reins this way."" OK! No harm in that.  I'm just a worrier and spin all sorts of ""maybe"" and ""what if"" scenarios through my head constantly. Like Leo, there is so much shit with the horses that just happens. We have absolutely no control, there is no fault, there is no blame, things just happen. So if I can have any ounce of control or prevention over other aspects, no matter how small or inconsequential, I get all excited that I'm actually helping or have a say haha. I've been around horses for basically my entire life, and in those 30 years (stupid birthday!) I'm still constantly faced with new things they manage to do that make me change things, or have someone pipe up with ""don't do it that way! I once saw X, Y, Z"" and then you're scratching your head wondering how the hell they did it.  At least they're never boring!"

Horses,382a9i,Sutemos,3,Mon Jun 1 09:53:58 2015 UTC,"You need to meet this horse to get a sense of his personality.  Arabs get a bad rep as being hot and crazy, but I've met Arabians who were therapy horses.  I've also met(and used to own) a crazy, bi-polar Quarter Horse.  It all depends on their temperament and what their environment growing up was like."
Horses,382a9i,ImaCheeseMonkey,2,Mon Jun 1 15:28:29 2015 UTC,"This horse, like all horses, could literally have any personality.  If it makes you feel better, Arab horses tend to be the most loyal in the world."

Horses,382a9i,theawesomestest,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:03:30 2015 UTC,"I think most horses breeds are good on the trail :) especially a half Arab! But more importantly, do you know what his personality is like? Is he spooky? What kind of training/experience does he have and does that match your level of riding? I thought my Arabian/QH mare and I were ready for the trail, she bucked me off and left me with two fractured ribs! Don't want this to happen to anyone else! Although trail riding seems easy and relaxed, if your horse is not familiar with being outside on the trail it can be really dangerous and they might want to run down the trail or spook at everything!  So I would 1. Make sure his training matches your level. 2. He has been on the trail before. 3. He is not overly spooky/sensitive. :)   Edit: for some reason I missed that he is 3 years old. for this age, unless you're a seasoned/horseman trainer I would recommend professional training before taking him out on the trail! Broken ribs are not fun!"
Horses,382a9i,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:55:05 2015 UTC,"Every Lippizaner I've known has been a LOT of horse. They do airs above ground in their free time and are super athletic. Even the 23 year old mare donated to a riding school I volunteered at in college, caprioles at the end of the lead and really kinda pushy during feeding time. I think they are born with big egos. But they're gorgeous so it works for them.   That said, if you're a strong horse person and not timid on the ground or in the saddle, you should be okay.   Arabs you never know. They're bred for so many different things that there isn't always one ""stereotype"" that fits them. Can you meet the parents?  And of course, individuality and training blah blah blah."
Horses,382a9i,bearxfoo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:52:23 2015 UTC,"I tend to find that a horse is a horse and that breed has little influence. There are ""breed"" stereotypes, such as Arabs are crazy, Thoroughbreds are hot, Quarter Horses are slow and dopey, but those are just that: stereotypes. I wouldn't expect much different from that horse then I would any other."
Horses,382a9i,mrflossin,-1,Mon Jun 1 11:48:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is true at all. A horse is a horse to a certain extent. For example Thoroughbreds are so interbred that a Thoroughbred is a Thoroughbred is a Thoroughbred, I haven't found them to differ from each other all that much. But from breed to breed absolutely there are HUGE differences. A holsteiner is not the same as a quarter horse, not even close. Their conformation is so different, their personalities are so different. People have been focusing on breeding certain traits into breeds of horses for a very very long time, so you can bet your ass each breed is totally different. For example, thoroughbreds were not bred to pull the cart, plow, and then go to hunt, so their personalities and general way of going reflect that, they were bred to race primarily so obviously horses that were bred primarily to race are not going to be the same as a horse like the Irish Draught or most of the warmblood breeds that were bred (originally) to do everything their family would require of them, this means they have a great degree of versatility, generally good way of going, and are easy keepers. This is what they were bred for. I'm guessing by your flair that you own Tennessee Walkers. I have a couple as well. A Tennessee Walker is not even close to the same thing as an Arabian. They were bred for totally different things. You have to look past the ""breed stereotypes"", but a lot of the time there is a reason for those stereotypes, and I think the examples you offered up are an extremely dumbed down version of it. I can describe the average Thoroughbred, Arabian, or Quarter Horse and it generally fits the breed. I wouldn't use words like ""hot"", ""slow"", or ""dopey"", but there is a way of going and personality that different breeds demonstrate generally, and that is worth looking at.  As far as what you are talking about OP, a lot more information than just the breed of horse is needed before making a decision to buy. If you have basic questions like this I'm just guessing a three year old is not the way to go for you they are a lot of work and extremely green all the time no exception. That would be more of a red flag for me than breeds. However, I would say that I would expect something pretty fancy out of the mix of those two breeds, flashy is my guess. I've seen a lot of Arabs going dressage that look absolutely fantastic, and obviously Lipizzaners excel in classical dressage. I can't say anything about personality because most horses generally have great personalities, but are ruined with people who don't know what they are doing or pushing too hard etc."
Horses,382a9i,bearxfoo,2,Mon Jun 1 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, some horses were bred with different tasks in mind. But what I meant is that all horses are, really, horses. Some breeds may do better at some things, but each horse is an individual. I've seen some very calm, collected Arabs, I've met TB's who have done everything under the sun, I've met QHs that were crazy and unpredictable, and I've met Walkers who were the worse trail companions.    My point was that in the grand scheme, a horse is a horse and I expect a horse to poop, eat hay and grass, spook at dumb shit and in general, be a horse, and I wouldn't expect a Walker, QH, or TB to be any different in that regard. Personality traits are individual more than across a breed."
Horses,382a9i,zerachechiel,0,Mon Jun 1 17:26:01 2015 UTC,"Everyone is saying ""oh every horse is unique breed stereotypes are dumb blah blah"" which is not untrue, but those answers aren't actually answering your question. Horses were bred to be a certain way so there is a degree of predictability in their offspring. In terms of nature vs. nurture, nurture has the biggest impact on a growing horse, but nature isn't to be discounted entirely.   Arabs are considered hot-blooded, so they tend to be on the more lively side. They can be very smart and curious, which also translates to being spooky when they get too curious. They are very lovely, kind horses, but they aren't the quietest things out there.  I don't have much personal experience with Lipizzaners, but some quick googling says that they are very smart (makes sense because they were bred to do the Haute Ecole and be warhorses).  Now, the more important factor is how the horse was raised. Show Arabs are NUTS because their fiery temper is prized in the show ring as being flashy. A backyard-bred Arab could be the sweetest, chill puppydog ever. Again, I don't know much about Lipizzaners, but I'd expect them to have a bit of a spark since they're generally used for some kind of showing as opposed to being workhorses. 3 years is pretty young, so it being goofy now doesn't necessarily mean they'll be like that once they grow up.  This is all in my terribly unprofessional opinion of course :)"

Horses,37vb8k,misskinky,6,Sat May 30 18:23:37 2015 UTC,"My husband and I did a horse honeymoon with Mountain Equestrian Trails in Belize for a week http://www.metbelize.com. It was fabulous! He wasn't much of a rider but became pretty good -- like he equivalent of a few years of horse camp I'd say, just bought him his first horse two weeks ago too so my plan worked;) The horses were great -- Barb QH crosses, comfy gates and boy could they traverse the terrain. It was really important that I knew they were taken care of and this was one of the few places in Belize that prided itself on that.  We'd go into areas you wouldn't get to without a vehicle and a long hike so it wasn't just a trail ride. It was just us and a guide for the week on the rides which was nice to canter when we wanted, swim for as long as we wanted and tie up at the bar on the way home. An all around amazing experience!  Would definitely do another horse vacation. There was one trip in Peru that looked fun...maybe for a very future anniversary."

One of my bigger worries is that I'd like to be able to canter, etc but I don't really know anybody else who rides, so it seems like it would be difficult to find a tour that could please a complete newbie and me too. Hearing that he got pretty comfortable quickly, is reassuring! Belize sounds amazing, too. What time of the year did you go?"
Horses,37vb8k,dome_sweet_dome,2,Sat May 30 19:05:57 2015 UTC,"We went in April.  Here is an album of our trip http://hannahandjamie.net/image/tid/6 The place was really good about placing us with appropriate horses.  My husband, being a newbie, got a steady eddy with pep and I got a horse that is the lead mare of the herd and usually only ridden by the guides  --  on the front page of their website, she's the palomino in front. She was still better than 90% of the horses I've ever ridden, but I tend to stay within the free to few hundred dollars price range and look for not ""completely out of its mind"" and ""potential."" Just spent more on husband's horse than on all my horses I've ever owned combined -- his comment after looking at the horse and both of us riding him was ""wow, he's so friendly and doesn't do anything bad. I want him."" Yeah, horses like that exist outside of Belize.   The saddles were nice too.  I didn't want to be tied down to a western and was really happy with the Wintec endurance they used. Guess leather rots in the rainforest so they use synthetics and nylon bridles.   A bonus was we were the only people there for most of that week -- except for the three brothers who were there for a night to go out on a hiking expedition -- my husband was in boy scouts with them in Saudi Arabia over 20 years ago. Totally random meeting! Talking about it is making me want to go back! If I could convince my husband to let me go, I'd go and canter with you! But really, a person with a little balance and a sense of adventure could do it.  My husband said he was sore, but the scenery and love made it all worth it."

Horses,37ro9j,mango2407,8,Fri May 29 21:05:38 2015 UTC,"Having horses is a luxury, not a right. I'd definitely call a vet/SPCA agent to look in on them for a welfare check. They probably also need vaccinations and dental work as well.   It's a shame you don't know who the owners are- friend/favor or not, I wouldn't want my horses to be kept like that. But then, there might be more to the story, such as the owners not paying the keepers for farrier/board or something. Maybe say something in conversation about it, casually mentioning they could use a trim and see what the neighbors say. You kind of have a bit of ""pull"" to say something like that, being that you're helping feed them with your field.  It's very noble of you to want to help look after them, but I think calling the farrier behind their back isn't the best way to go about it. At best, they'll be taking advantage of you and at worst, they may get angry."
Horses,37ro9j,carbonarbonoxide,9,Sat May 30 01:49:42 2015 UTC,"No, don't pay for other people's fuckups.   Call the local appointed vet anonymously, say you were out hiking and saw the horses.

Horses,37ro9j,bearxfoo,2,Fri May 29 21:21:08 2015 UTC,"I might be on a different side of the fence here, but... there may be more to this then you're realizing?   Sometimes horses hooves can ""look"" really bad but not be. For example, my one gelding had very WIDE hooves and even a week after being trimmed, he'd look very ""dinner plate"" with his hooves. He'd also get superficial cracks from the dry weather which would work out by the time the farrier returned again. Flat, wide hooves and some cracks are not abuse. Some horses have crappy hooves, some have great hooves naturally. Cracks are common especially in overly wet or dry weather and can be difficult to treat or prevent. My mare always gets cracks no matter what I do, including farrier every 5 weeks or so and hoof dressings.   Also, it depends on the horse and how long you go in between trims. Some horses feet grow very fast but others, slower. My senior gelding has slowed down in his hoof growing and can go quite some time before a trim and this is even more true in the winter.   Just some food for thought... I wouldn't be assuming the horses are ill-cared for based one some hooves. If they're in good weight and have food and water... also, it's common for horses to eat up a whole pasture in the summer and need a substitute of hay, especially if the pasture is smaller."
Horses,37ro9j,voicesinmyhand,2,Mon Jun 1 12:13:35 2015 UTC,"Good response.  I wanted to add - Cracked hooves are also common when the weather switches from dry to wet often, or when the weather is dry, but the horse stands in mud."
Horses,37ro9j,voicesinmyhand,-2,Tue Jun 2 07:12:10 2015 UTC,"This is not a fun situation to be in. I do not envy you one bit.  On the one hand, this kind of thing is exactly why non-horse people can't stand us - constantly meddling in other people's business and insisting that they meet our arbitrary level of care.  On the other hand, animal abuse is terrible, and the horse (probably) didn't do anything to deserve it.  For the rest of my post I'm going to avoid focusing on this as everyone else will only tell you this.  Seriously consider whether your neighbors are abusing the animal or just not caring for it the way you would.  You kinda have to live next to them after the fallout of all this, and given what you said, a vet is likely to not be able to change the situation at all.  Instead of looking just at the length of the hoof wall, check whether thrush is developing on the sole.  Overgrown hooves are horrible to look at, but usually don't bother the animal much. (limping or refusal to walk is a good sign that there is a problem)  For comparison, take a walk through state land in Nevada and get a good look at the wild horses there.  Some of them get their hooves worn down reasonably, but a lot of them don't and are severely overgrown.  They are all skin and bones, and yet they are reasonably happy for wild animals.  I'm not advocating that horses should be left like this, I'm just pointing out that the typical level of care is way beyond what a horse actually needs.  Or...  There is a way easier solution.  Trimming a horse's hooves isn't all that hard.  I have been doing mine since 15 years ago.  In general, the big thing is that you don't go too deep and that the angle of the hoof lines up with the angle of the hock, but watch out because some horses simply can't grow hooves that way no matter how you trim them.  Something something advise a person to at least read a vet book or watch the farrier a few times while asking questions, something something it's not all that hard.  To do it, you'll need nippers (like $100 at a feed store, or $8.95 at Home Depot), a hoof knife (~$8), and a rasp (~$25).  Use the knife to cut away the excess material between the frog and hoof wall (the sole) - You usually don't have to cut this very deep at all as mostly you are making it easy for the nippers to do their job.  If the hooves are severely overgrown, then you might not be able to access this part at all.  Also, some horses have ridiculously hard soles and you simply can't cut them with a knife.  It should come off either as a flaky powder or as smelly, hard clippings of hoof-like material.  If it is oozing or spongy to the touch you have a problem warranting a vet visit.  A hideous smell with no other symptoms probably just means that the frog is rotting, which it will do twice a year pretty much no matter what you do.  Clip the excess wall, using the frog as a guide (never cut past the frog as that is too deep, I usually leave a quarter inch excess or so, but most farriers I have used go flat even with the frog. YMMV).  Lastly, rasp the bottom of the hoof so that there are no sharp edges, verifying periodically whether the horse is able to stand straight on it.  In the end, if the horse is standing straight up on level ground, the hock and hoof should line up on the front and back and the hock should be even left-to-right, not tilted one way or the other.  Good luck with your neighbors."
Horses,37ro9j,qwinz,4,Mon Jun 1 06:19:41 2015 UTC,"sorry but trimming them yourself is a bad idea, (for OP) if you have never done that before. if they are as bad as you say, or even if they aren't, you can royally fuck up a horse with one bad trim job. I'd talk to the owners and ask them if you can recommend a farrier."
Horses,37svkw,E-Rocka,5,Sat May 30 03:00:41 2015 UTC,"Her conformation seems nice for that age - her pasterns are a little more on the vertical than I'd like, and she's a little long in the neck, but she might even out a little as she grows. Her legs seem to be very thin right under the knees, but again that might even out when she grows up a little more.   I don't know how much I would trust the seller on height - she'll grow a little more but you can never be too sure what they'll make.

Horses,37svkw,Quiinton,2,Sun May 31 03:27:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Aztecas tend to be pretty slight horses, and they're usually not any more than 16 hands. She looks cute in the videos, but there's not really enough there to tell her movement - maybe go see her and put her on a lunge line before you buy? She seemed to bob her head quite a bit at the beginning of her trot on the left. The only thing that's possible to definitely tell from the videos is that she's going to be fairly desensitized to clucking noises, haha."
Horses,37svkw,Quiinton,1 point,Sun May 31 03:57:00 2015 UTC,"I know, going to see her in person would be much easier, but I live on an island so its not as easy to get to the mainland haha. I will do a pre-purchase exam when I am feeling like ih have found ""the one"", as I dont want to spend the money on every horse Im looking at. I have widened my search and found some really nice yearlings, new fav is a draft warmblood x who is going to be a big girl and has lots of bine thanks to the clyde, so I know I will fit her better. Fingers crossed on this one! :) I have a video of her if you are interested, thanks for the response!"

We have to be polite generally, though in reality we see far more thin cases than fat ones, particularly in the horse world. In small animal land, we've actually had to invent a new body conditioning score scale, because we had animals coming in that would be a 12 or 13 on the old 1-9 scale. Its kinda sad."

Horses,37pznz,mrflossin,2,Fri May 29 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do it with my mare fairly often. She can be pushy so when I need to move her feet out in the pasture without a rope or anything I just pretend I have one. I'll twirl my whole arm like it was the rope if she's trying to be lazy about it. Everything else is just her reading my body language to stop, change direction, etc.  I'm not sure why she doesn't just say ""screw you!"" and head off across the pasture when I'm making her trot/canter in circles around me. I just tell myself there must be a good horse buried in there somewhere!"

Horses,37o7en,amousecaledmicky,5,Fri May 29 02:24:13 2015 UTC,"You have great elasticity in your elbow for a beginner! Keep that!  Still posting the wrong diagonal sometimes, and try not to absorb so much of the impact in your lower back (ask me how I know! That was me for a long time!)- you tend to rock your hips and then bend your back on the ""down"" phase of the canter stride.... instead try to have more flexible knees and ankles with your leg under you to act as shock absorbers, if that makes sense? You should break at the ankle, then the knee, then a swing of the hip with a straight back. It takes time and practice, no worries. But doing it the way you are right now is gonna be something you really feel in about ten years when things start to stiffen up!  Other than that, fantastic!"
Horses,37o7en,carbonarbonoxide,3,Fri May 29 03:34:51 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU. Im 30 years old but look young for my age. My lower back has been hurting after lessons. I'll really heed your advice!  This wasny my normal trainer, but my normal trainer always tells me to have ""oily elbows"" so its been a focus for a few weeks. I practice all the time. Walking with a glass of liquid?  Keep it stationary with tight fingers as I move!  It was only a month ago or so when I realized I can use my thighs to cushion my weight. My trainer had me do no stirrup posting trot practice and a lot of things just clicked all at once. However, I am starting to use my lower leg less and less during sitting gaits. I have really powerful thighs and just cheat and hold my weight there. Riding today, I was thinking about trying to put my weight in my feet as sometimes my feet shift around in my stirrups. Thank you so much for your critique! Feel free to dig in more! You never know when you can shift someones perspective!"
Horses,37o7en,Unicornz20,5,Fri May 29 03:44:07 2015 UTC,I wish i looked this good when I was learning to jump! You look great!
Horses,37o7en,altf4life,1 point,Sat May 30 08:22:58 2015 UTC,Thanks!
Horses,37o7en,ellevt,3,Sat May 30 12:34:21 2015 UTC,"I think you need to bring up your stirrups a hole or two. Not a ton, but your lower leg is swinging a little and your heel is not as down as it should be. Your heels are also a bit far forward in a ""chair"" seat. Focus on keeping a straight like from Ears to Shoulder to Hip To Heel.   I know you're a guy, and testicles and everything but you have a pretty severe roach back. You need to close your hip angle a little bit (stick your butt out), a 2 point or ""half/galloping seat"" in the canter is going to be your best friend to keep your eq on point for jumping bigger jumps. Remember to keep your shoulders back as well, you're leaning forward quite a bit at some points.   Your hand is quite soft, but remember to keep a bend in your elbow and thumbs on top. You're giving from with your body and shoulder with straight arms when you should be allowing your elbow to act as a the ""giving"" joint.   A little bit more advanced- but try to keep a bend to the jump. This will help your horse land on the correct lead. You had it for the first jump, but lost the bend at the second and your horse landed on the wrong lead. Alternatively, give the canter cue (shift outside like slightly back and squeeze) over the jump. It's hard when you're riding school ponies used to ignoring everything, but it'll help you later on.   edit- I love that you're looking up, ahead and where you want to be going."

Horses,37o7en,ellevt,2,Fri May 29 02:28:36 2015 UTC,"Doing great!  Leaning forward a touch at all stages, I would work on staying up right a little more - it will help with the occasional bouncing you seem to do.   But your elbows are really, really good.  One thing I REALLY DON'T LIKE is that you are very early in your riding career but you are carrying a whip.  Beginners tend to lean on whips instead of learning to do it properly, be careful this doesn't become you. Sometimes they are necessary but I find mostly good riding makes up for a lack of whip.  I'm telling you this because I carried mine as an excuse for a weak canter aid for years, only now is my leg strong enough to push lazy babies into that canter and I've been riding for twelve years.  So be careful, but doing great!"
Horses,37o7en,showmebevelle,1 point,Sat May 30 03:19:25 2015 UTC,"I think I only had to whip Jack once... and this was after a solid 30 seconds of kicking to trot. The trainer got me a crop. Kick, kick, tap, smack. After that I just had to occasionally waive it in eye sight or lift and let it fall.   I recognize your concern, but my normal training horse really needs a crop to get going at all. Even my trainer carries one when she rides him. And I think it's only been to get up to trot."
Horses,37o7en,ellevt,2,Sat May 30 03:24:35 2015 UTC,"I understand using them as training aids, but just remember if you go to compete there's so many disciplines that don't allow whips to be carried, dressage especially.   My old school master needs a bit of a tap to get cantering and quite frankly I haven't got the foggiest how I'm going to compete him next month.  Just remember to train without a whip for a week or two before a show to refine the aids, or else face a lazy pony on the day. (Unless he gets mildly hot at shows, and then you're just lucky.)"

Horses,37l8ur,Laura_Wingfield,9,Thu May 28 13:13:25 2015 UTC,"Horses are my therapy. When I'm riding is the only time that my mind is 100% focused and not wandering, sad, anxious, stressed, etc. All I can think about is how I'm holding myself and how to work best with the horse under me. They keep me sane."
Horses,37l8ur,misskinky,3,Thu May 28 16:08:57 2015 UTC,"I started riding when I was 7. My mother told me that on my seventh birthday, I could choose a sport to play once a week. I chose riding Shetland ponies, because my friend from elementary school did that too. My mother wasn't very happy because she was scared of horses, but she did promise me the sport that I wanted.   Almost 16 years later, I still ride and my mother isn't scared anymore. Horses are one of the few consistencies in my life. They give me peace of mind. In everyday life I'm a stressed undergrad student, introverted and socially awkward. With my lease horse I just feel like he likes me and wants to work together with me. I just love that I have them in my life and I imagine my life in 5 years with a horse of my own by my side."
Horses,37l8ur,I_like_your_unit,3,Thu May 28 15:41:11 2015 UTC,"I feel like horses are the one thing that is inherently me.  I'm the type of person who picks up the interests of the people that I'm around the most, and a lot of things that are important to me are important because of someone else. I know that is the case with a lot of people, but it seems to be exaggerated in my life, but horses have always been just mine. Growing up, I didn't have any ""horsey"" friends that introduced me to riding, and my family were and still are completely horse clueless. It wasn't an interest I adopted from someone else, it was just mine, like I was born with it already in my blood.  These days, horses are still ""just mine,"" I've met lots of great people at my current barn, but they're my barn friends and kind of stay in that sphere of my life and haven't crossed into other parts of it. I work full time in a corporate office, have my SO, our pets, our families and friends and all of those things in life that are wonderful and challenging . Horses might only be a small part of my day to day life, but when I open the barn door and step in to hear the soft munching of hay, the odd snort, and that wonderfully familiar, never changing barn smells hits my lungs - it's just for me. The rest of my world melts away and for a couple hours I can just be completely, and absolutely, me.   Sometimes life happens and you need a moment to remember who you really are, and nothing solves that dilemma for me better than a day with a horse."

You can see the face is not dished, so you can rule out Arabian, they're fairly stout and wide-chested, so you can rule out Thoroughbred (although a thoroughbred cross isn't completely unlikely), obviously not draft or pony breed, nor a paint or appaloosa, so unless this is some sort of exotic import it's probably a Quarter Horse or QH mix."

Horses,37h248,alexthegiantful,2,Wed May 27 19:31:04 2015 UTC,"Old western saddles like this are not the best for riding in the modern day and here is why.  Modern day saddles have bars that start flat to spread weight, they twist (narrow) under the rider and then flare to accommodate the shoulders of the horse.  Old saddles Go flat, twist and then carry on with no flare.  This is for 2 reasons  1) contours were hard to accomplish back then   2) they WANTED the tree to dig into the shoulders to keep the saddle from sliding forward especially on downhill horses.  It wont be worth a lot to people who have horses but there are people who make really cool stools and swings out of old western saddles and that is your best bet.  Might get up to 150-200 if you give the leather some conditioning."
Horses,37h248,Allyz0r,2,Thu May 28 01:46:36 2015 UTC,Pinterest turned me on to that saddle swing idea. Once I have kids there will be one in the backyard for sure! They're pretty adorable.

In trail riding and endurance, people use halter bridle combos, it's convenient when you want to stop for a break or get into a bad spot on the trial. Who knows what kind of stirrups those are, it's difficult to tell by this picture.  Also, if this is a horse that is just being started, who would want to use their good tack? It could easily get ruined, use your old crappy stuff until you trust the horse not to be an idiot.   Although, this picture does not show that you have a broke horse, and she should be wearing a helmet, I think you're judging her on the wrong things. If you know this person and know she's not a good trainer, that's one thing, but fancy tack does not make a good horseman."

It made sense at the time, and I want to pound whoa into all my horses.  Fast forward to her first show some months later and she was being absolutely amazing. It was a windy day and she picked up and maintained a calm balanced canter. I barely muttered ""good girl"" under my breath and almost gloriously Supermanned over her head when she slammed on the brakes in a decent impression of a reiner slide. ""whoa"" and ""good girl"" were apparently synonymous...and I very rarely say ""good girl"" or ""good boy"" to horses these days LOL"
Horses,379q3h,TheMilkSlut,5,Tue May 26 13:05:20 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of a show barn in my area that I would run into quite often at schooling shows a while back. This teeny little girl was jumping this hefty little appy who always reluctantly launched himself over the jumps. I'm not sure what the deal was, but before every single jump she, and the other students and her trainer around the ring would all shout ""SPACESHUTTLE!!"" and he would just barrel over these little 18"" fences. It was adorable, that they had obviously very purposely gotten this pony to react to the word ""SPACESHUTTLE."", I'm thinking to avoid refusals, and keep this little girl focused."

Shit happens, and if the vet missed even a little something when gelding him, he can still sometimes have stallion like instincts. If necessary separate when your mare is in heat."

Horses,379vqj,justinblades,6,Tue May 26 01:31:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly I doubt it would be a good or effective idea. Back in WWI when we didn't have as much access to military vehicles and aircraft, sure, horses were a good military tool. Ditto with medieval times, back then horses were really the ultimate transportation (since otherwise people would just be traveling on foot, and horses could travel farther, faster, and for longer periods of time than humans).   However, the fact is, any horses used in the military would be killed along with their riders. Horses, no matter how well outfitted, aren't any match for modern weaponry. If a convoy of military vehicles can be destroyed by an IED, what do you think would happen to an animal?   Some animals can be of good use in the military (ie. dogs, bees, and rats for detecting explosives and other smells - a job that we don't have an efficient technology for), however there really isn't a use for horses - horses are transportation for humans, and military vehicles are a much better form of transportation that can have specialized uses (IED sweepers, armored vehicles, etc). Pretty much all military vehicles are faster, can travel longer distances, and offer protection to people (which horses really do not).   As a side note, any kevlar or other clothing materials used on animals would be better put to use for humans. If there's only x amount of budget for issued protective gear, there's no sense in wasting that on an animal that doesn't serve a good purpose.   Overall, horses really are not a good option anymore, mostly because they simply don't offer any protection to humans, and don't offer us anything our technology doesn't already do. 100, 150 years ago? Maybe, yes, they were a good option. But not today, and probably not anytime in the future."
Horses,379vqj,Quiinton,0,Tue May 26 04:01:40 2015 UTC,yes but they are training soldiers in horsemanship again because it is still easier to use horses in certain parts of the middle east. im just telling you what i saw on the news...
Horses,379vqj,NeverendingStarchild,3,Tue May 26 05:44:40 2015 UTC,"I could see horses being useful in similar ways that some police forces still use horses - namely, crowd control. I don't think they would be very effective overseas but if there was a state of emergency due to terrorism or natural disaster where crowd control was needed then horses could be effective. People who do not know horses are more fearful/respectful of the horse than of a random car a rioting crowd might otherwise burn. Most of what is going on overseas these days is a deescalation of armed forces presence. Troops are working now on closing bases rather than opening new ones. In order to progress into a more peaceful symbiosis it could be more diplomatic to utilize a more primitive method of transportation than a heavily guarded truck."
Horses,377mdl,mrflossin,3,Mon May 25 15:22:45 2015 UTC,"Eventing is a bit of a strange area for breeding. I'm not really an expert, but you do see all different types of horses competing, at least here in the UK. Badminton was earlier this month and on tv they were making a fuss about different heights shapes etc of the horses. Mulry's Error competed and is half Clydesdale! Although there were some doubts about his stamina he jumped as well as the other horses.  It's not completely unknown to have stallions eventing at the high levels. Badminton was won by William Fox-Pitt and a stallion, Chilli Morning. Here's his stud page. I suppose the risk and extensive training put people off trying to show stallions.   TBs are a completely different world! The horses are considered part of a business, earning money from racing, stud fees etc. The owners who are spending lots of money, ie Coolmore, Darley, understand the risks and money involved.  Many seem to have unlimited money!   I'd say the mare plays an equal or sometimes more important role than the stallion.  If you consider that a popular stallion could have 100s of foals a year but a mare can only have one. So a foal with a better quality dam should more sought after. Of course pedigree is only one aspect and doesn't guarantee success. Famous example being Snaafi Dancer.   I agree, horse breeding really does need to be limited. Sadly there are too many unwanted horses and people overbreeding doesn't help."
Horses,377mdl,itstashoo,2,Mon May 25 19:02:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was so interested and happy to see a stallion win that event. Hopefully he produces stock as good as himself.  I do like that all kinds of horses can at least somewhat successfully event in the right hands. There's no one eventing type, and even when there seems to be (TBs and ISH here) that may change in the next five years. I'm actually going to start retraining one of my family's TWH for eventing later this year, it should be interesting and hopefully fun. He's a lazy tiny guy but worst case scenario I 'll get some good laughs"
Horses,377mdl,itstashoo,2,Mon May 25 19:10:37 2015 UTC,He actually already has some foals! look at the foal jumping the flowerpot haha.  Very true. Good luck with your TWH! I've never seen a gaited horse over here but I'd love to ride one someday.
Horses,377mdl,carbonarbonoxide,2,Mon May 25 19:37:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with you on color-breeding. Most of those programs end up with pretty consistent conformation faults and mediocre performance. Color and a horse's name are the LAST two things I look at in a horse when I'm shopping (and I didn't even know my last horse's name til I brought her home for the PPE, lol).... But a lot of amateurs REALLY care about that as a must-have which astounds me!  As a non-eventer I never paid much attention to ""eventing"" sires, but that is a very interesting point you bring up! I think I once read an article somewhere on somebody saying that very thing- not many people are equipped to bring a stallion up the levels like that. There is a black TB (Sea Accounts?) around this area, but he doesn't seem to do a WHOLE lot either.   Here is a good one: the article"
Horses,377mdl,carbonarbonoxide,2,Mon May 25 18:42:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting that article those were probably the reasons I would cite for not competing a stallion to upper levels of eventing. I understand that they can become proven stallions by having offspring on the ground setting competition records, but I feel like that promotes some almost experimental breeding and overbreeding to maybe get those few babies up and running that can perform at upper levels. Honestly if I was going to breed any of my horses right now I'd probably look closer at a show jumping or dressage type stallion than any of the eventing geared stallions out there.   There's a few stallions geared toward eventing and a lot of them don't do that much. With the exception of Flagmount's Freedom who I am wary about as they wayyy overbred him and he didn't pass inspection the first time around, was only passed based on offspring performance which was in turn only possible by overbreeding. He's got a good ID line, I just don't know that I'd breed to him. My current favorite two stallions for eventing are King's Ransom and Jackaroo (full brother to High Kingdom)"
Horses,377mdl,petalpie,2,Tue May 26 03:56:04 2015 UTC,"Their logic was interesting, with the risk vs. reward of running those competitions, and how with their... anatomy, literally it's sometimes tough to even get them going that well over XC. I'm with you that I want a proven competitor who was sane both breeding and traveling, and that the ""experimental"" camp would be a bit detrimental in terms of population."
Horses,377mdl,runaround66,2,Tue May 26 03:59:54 2015 UTC,Out of curiousity I'm wondering if those equine jock straps would help them out?
Horses,377mdl,ClassicHoof,3,Tue May 26 04:07:37 2015 UTC,"I disagree with breeding for performance. Too many competition horses (racehorses especially) break down early because while they are powerfully built, their legs are toothpicks, they have bad pasterns, short backs or whatever other flaw that's detrimental to their welfare. When breeding a horse, you should consider first how good it is at being a horse and second how useful it is to you. Consider Ruffian for example, a really fast mare, definitely good at her ""job"". Look how she ended, look at her legs."
Horses,377mdl,ClassicHoof,3,Mon May 25 18:01:52 2015 UTC,"I agree that racehorses have been being built in a way that is not beneficial to the breed or the horse at all, but performance horses of different varieties is what I was more talking about. Mostly sporthorses. I also think that breeding quarter horses for being performance halter horses is detrimental to their breed as a whole, if the horse has fundamental issues that cause medical problems later on or injury, they should not be bred no matter the performance record."
Horses,377mdl,ze1da,1 point,Mon May 25 18:16:39 2015 UTC,"As someone who boards at a barn that ""breeds and trains reiners"" (uni quotes because they've never had a horse do anything but zero out at a show), the fascination with grandsires and great-grandsires is insane. I caught so much crap for getting two mares based on confirmation (the dreaded c-word) and personality and not bloodline. They're ranch stock, so nothing super impressive on either side, but they move beautifully, they're super sweet, and they're built like tanks. I'd be willing to lay good money that either could outride any of the 'reining' horses too if they weren't still green."

Horses,3796dq,dunmorestriden,1 point,Tue May 26 03:04:22 2015 UTC,You're going to need a trainers help. She doesn't want to work probably. Make it more work for her to stand there then to go in the arena or wherever you want her to go. Take it in baby steps aswell. If she even looks like she's going to take a step take off the pressure and let her have a little release as a reward and just keep going like that until she eventually walks forward.

Here's the problem: she will go anywhere I walk her with a lead rope and ride fine in that area for as long as I want to. The second I step out of that area (arena etc) and I am on her she will not go ANY WHERE except for her stall. The only way I can get her to go other places is if I get off and start walking her again. I don't know how to fix this because she knows what to do, she isn't dumb.

Horses,379ith,ReReDRock1039,6,Mon May 25 23:44:13 2015 UTC,"It sucks that it can be inconvenient for you, but it just isn't a thing to do so. Not for the riders as far as I know. Besides, it ruins the rider's experience to be carrying a bag with a few pounds of poop in it. (Yeah, it ruins yours to have that happen as well). Maybe people who manage trails could do regular cleaning (propose it to your city? I don't know how these things work) - but it isn't realistic in my opinion to expect that on trails that allow horses. If it bothers you that much perhaps choose a different trail?"
Horses,379ith,rottingseams,-3,Mon May 25 23:51:14 2015 UTC,"How often do horses poop?  Would it be too inconvenient or ruin the riding experience to take a minute to dismount, kick the poop off the trail, then mount up and be on your way?  They call those fancy boots ""shit-kickers"" right?"
Horses,379ith,mrflossin,9,Tue May 26 00:00:52 2015 UTC,"The poop usually falls to pieces when you touch it or kick it so instead of having a nice easily avoidable pile, you have half a road of shit. And it's not a ""ruining the experience"" thing as much as a safety thing. If I get down off my horse to move shit so that you can be happy, and my horse gets loose you could end up with an injured horse or injured people. As far as your other response that horse shit is slippery, it wouldn't be slippery to a car, and only slippery to a bike if it wet and brakes are slammed when on a flattened pile"
Horses,379ith,rottingseams,1 point,Tue May 26 01:18:48 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the length of the trail ride. Whenever I go out and ride my mare poops at least once in a two hour period, and they also go when they're nervous.  That could be a solution, yes, but some riders also might not want to dismount in case their horse bolts (which they probably shouldn't if they're trail conditioned, but you never know). Oh well. All I can say is sorry that upset you I guess."
Horses,379ith,rottingseams,-2,Tue May 26 00:25:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I'm not upset, like I said, just looking to see how someone who rides justifies not cleaning up.

Horses,379ith,dunmorestriden,1 point,Tue May 26 00:33:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly doing so has never crossed my mind before, but then again I don't trail ride, only in arenas and around the stable - I feel like since a lot of people are always in places like arenas or fox hunting or their own property that it's just usual and acceptable that it doesn't cross their mind to do anything about it. Well, I guess you got some answers anyway even if it wasn't what you wanted to hear, it can't always be that. Good luck with your issue on this."
Horses,379ith,bearxfoo,-4,Tue May 26 00:38:10 2015 UTC,I don't understand why people can't just tie a garbage bag to their saddle. It's what I do and if you have a horse that will spook at it I honestly do not think you should have a horse out on public trails if it can't handle a bag hanging off it. I mean I know it is a lot more effort but if you're riding on public roads that are paved/gravel you really should at least kick it to the side or carry a bag...
Horses,379ith,dunmorestriden,5,Tue May 26 05:30:09 2015 UTC,"That is the most dangerous idea, ever. I've seen trained POLICE HORSES spook at flapping bags, among other things. Horses are flight animals - there's no way around that and even the most ""trained"" horse can panic and spook. Every single horse spooks. There is no exception.   Do you think it's a good idea to carry a heavy bag of poop on a saddle? Where do you tie it? Wouldn't the weight of the poop rip the bag? What if I decide to canter? How does a flapping bag of poop stay on a saddle at a canter? What if I canter and my horse sees it bounce?"
Horses,379ith,breannabalaam,0,Tue May 26 21:54:28 2015 UTC,Hordes should be desensitized to flapping bags. It's the first thing most people do when sacking out colts. If you have a heavy duty garbage bag it works and you just get them used to it at different speeds on a line in an arena.

Baby snorted, got the bag stuck on his face, and went tearing around the field unable to get it off. He's never going to be ok with plastic bags and this is a horse that will put up with damn near anything"
Horses,379ith,Unicornz20,8,Sat May 30 09:24:45 2015 UTC,"1) Sometimes they do.  2) Because it is extremely impractical: Dis/mount and carry a 2 kg bag of shit? Where put it? And if I can toss it into the next public garbage bin in your opinion, I bet we'll find a bunch of people who'll disagree that riders should do that. At least the people who clear those when certain garbage bins then become manure pits. Where do I keep the shovel necessary? Also horse poop is extremely valuable as fertilizer once it decomposed a bit. Except if you mix in so much plastic from those bags which is impossible to get out reasonably again.  2) a) There are not enough garbage bins and they are too small.  3) Going back to the sometimes they do: Some kick it under the next bush or turn their horse just to the side of the path the moment it wants to poop. If that's ok for you we are all good. If not you are merely aesthetically affected and there's neither a good argument for nor against your position except that you want it this way. I want it the other way. We all have our reasons.  3) a) Horse poop doesn't smell bad compared to a lot of other poop.  4) Why don't car drivers capture the CO2 they blast into the environment to the detriment of all of us? Why don't you help up the grass that you walked on 5 minutes ago for others to enjoy and breath its oxygen? Why don't you fix your just every so slightly rattling bicycle thing-aling-ding because someone somewhere will find that barely audible creaky sound annoying I am sure... And stop ringing your bell that crazy your bicycle annoys my horse anyway! Why is your dog allowed to run free and rampage on the local wildlife??  5) Please come down from the idea that there is something like ""clean"" in the outside. The whole road/trail you are walking on is covered in bird piss and beetle poop when it didn't rain for a week, you just never thought about that. Plus: Wild animals shit everywhere too, not to mention those goddamn cats who are especially fond of using the neighbours garden as a toilet. A horse at least poops onto the street in the overwhelming time of cases that it pooped in such a spot where it is inconvenient to the public in some way. The pedestrian walks/paths/sideways have been raised to the road level for a reason since ancient times (the riders in your town should use the vehicle lane and behave like vehicles imho - at least that's the traffic code around here. Not to forget: Then everyone is pissed how that ""slows traffic""). Guess what that reason might be for the raised paths, and stop walking in the middle of the road. Or ok, you on a trail. It's dirt anyway. Much of it used to be poop and now decomposed to nice humus and a little grass is growing on it. Still former poop to an alarming level.  6) I am sorry to be a snob, but where I am from the stupid city needed money and levied a tax on horses because obviously horse people are all snobs made of money. When asked they specifically stated the horse poop as a ""use of public space"", and a ""burden on others"", and said the city needed ""merely to recover the cleaning costs"". Obviously they lied and just wanted to flush the city coffers to then flush the money somewhere else. There's no way cleaning horse poop is such a giant post in the budget. But in the official line of speak: I am sorry it might annoy you right now, but I already paid for that (and a lot) so leave me alone. If you still have a problem complain to the city tax collector, he'll apparently send a cleaning crew.  7) It might be a superb idea to teach your dog not to eat anything outside.  8) The idea that dog owners should pick up certainly only arrived when it became a problem. Never before have so many people lived in such concentrated spots but also had so many pets. I bet nobody gave a shit (figuratively) where the farm dog pooped in the 1400s when the population density in some areas was 2 bears per square kilometre and a tenth of a human. But now in some cities 300 people walk their dogs 3 times a day around that one park nearby. That's 900 shits a day on that little park with the 4 Banks and a flower bed in the middle. If they decompose over a two weeks (which horse poop does excellently while dog poop becomes a hardened brick), that's a cumulative 12600 dog poops on the little park with it's one flower bed... and some people realized there was a bit of a problem there. Still if we were living in the middle of the woods, just you and me, who the f. would care where the poop goes exactly within 2 square miles? But oh god those 10 horses that come by and one pooped ..."
Horses,379ith,ClassicHoof,1 point,Tue May 26 20:00:03 2015 UTC,The idea that dog owners should pick up certainly only arrived when it became a problem.   Also the fact that dogs tend to poop on lawns and people get sheisty about their lawns.  And dog poop is a shit fertilizer.  And it smells awful if it accidentally gets mowed.
Horses,379ith,hoofbeats,1 point,Wed May 27 04:15:31 2015 UTC,Thank you for writing this comment. I 100% agree with you.
Horses,379ith,Shield_Maiden831,3,Sat May 30 08:35:13 2015 UTC,"Just so you know usually parks limit what trails horses are allowed on for this reason. Near me there's only 2-3 trails per park that horses can go on, none are paved. So if you look at your trail maps maybe you can determine which trails exclude horses. Also, dogs always eat horse poop, and mine eats rotting animals. It's just what they do. Don't worry though, most horses only eat hay, grass, and grain. Maybe it is nutritious!"
Horses,379ith,spellboundsilk92,2,Wed May 27 16:58:25 2015 UTC,My dog often in rolls in the horse poop on the beach. But he also rolls in dead seagulls. I'd take the poop over the alternative any day
Horses,379ith,IndustrialTreeHugger,6,Wed May 27 19:44:12 2015 UTC,"I have a 16.2 H TB, and he is too large to mount on trail if I get off. I have heard repeatedly that mounting from the ground can injure horse's backs, especially with the height difference. Walking a mile to a stump with a nervous horse might also be very dangerous. They don't like to stop sometimes, poop when they are nervous, and then you end up having to get off the horse in an area he doesn't already like. To answer your question of how often they poop - 8-12 times a day. They are herbivores and pretty much churn out recycled lawn clippings. The poop really does biodegrade fast and usually has no odor after a day. Carrying 20 lbs of poop with me in saddle bags would be super weird. Also carrying a shovel to pick it up. Can you imagine how hard it would be to hold a horse with one hand and pick up a pile with the other? Honestly, it is incredibly difficult from a logistical standpoint, borders on dangerous, and all for a substance that was in any potted plant you ever owned sitting on your desk. I would really think of it more like plant sludge than poop, treat it like a puddle on trail and bike around it if you are worried about traction."
Horses,379ith,burmeoww,2,Tue May 26 05:30:31 2015 UTC,"It's far less harmful and decomposes quicker You think it's a pain trying to pass me on the road when i'm just riding? You would have even more reason to moan when i'm messing about in the middle of the road, holding on to a bored, impatient horse and trying to scoop horse sized piles of shit at the same time. safety. Even the best behaved horses have their less than perfect moments. It is far safer for everyone if i'm on top of the horse should that happen. Horses tend to be in more rural areas. Less people who are bothered by it and it normally doesnt get a chance to pile up to the extent it becomes a huge problem. If you're offended by piles of shit, maybe the city is better for you, because you're going to completely overlook the odd pile of horse shit, once a farmer has moved his cows from one field to another using the roads :)"
Horses,379ith,arandomusername101,2,Wed May 27 19:41:24 2015 UTC,"I do not own a horse, but what about a ""bun bag"" to keep the peace if you ride in a more busy area?  Do these work?    I say this as someone who doesn't mind the horse poo and when it is dry I have no issue picking it up with my bare hands (I'm a farmer! haha), but the look and smell of my great dane's ""manure"" makes me wanna hurl.    I don't know if it is because dogs are omnivores and horses are just herbivores... but goodness, horse poo just seems to be so much more sanitary!  lol"
Horses,379ith,spellboundsilk92,1 point,Fri May 29 01:17:49 2015 UTC,"My 2c: I don't own a horse but this is what I think.  Typically, people don't clean horse poop off the street because horses are not usually ridden where it would be a problem for passers-by. I clean up dog shit when I'm walking my dog because usually I'm on a footpath, where people might step on it. I'd be less inclined to clean horse shit off a road, because it's not really a problem if a car drives over it. It'll dry and flake off the tyres in less than an hour, if it doesn't fall off way before that. It's better to let that happen than to potentially hold up traffic to pick it up.   However, I'm sympathetic about the bike lane thing. Cyclists are at risk for getting horse shit sprayed in their face: that sucks and I don't think bike lanes are necessarily the best place to ride a horse. On slow surface roads, I'd think the car lanes would be fine...at least in any place where it's common to ride your horse around on the road.   Also, horse poop is just generally considered less gross than dog poop. I've stepped in both, and horse shit is much better to step in. I've even stepped in slushy horse diarrhea...gross at the time, but it dried and flaked off that same day. Dog shit smells like death and is much harder to clean.   Yeah it sucks that your dog went and ate some shit, but honestly dogs do that and they eat tons of other gross things all the time. My dog has eaten my tampons out of the garbage, and cat shit out of the cat litter. We do our best to avoid these things but at a certain point you have to just accept that dogs are icky."

Horses,379ith,Supakwe,3,Tue May 26 00:37:53 2015 UTC,Horse poop is actually dry.  It's only wet went it's fresh.  It really doesn't take long to dry.

Horses,379ith,Supakwe,1 point,Wed May 27 16:54:28 2015 UTC,"I know it seems like a shitty thing to do (HAHAHA i'm sorry) but it's mostly because we're too lazy to bother. It's kind of really inconvenient when you're in the middle of a ride. Also, the dismounting/remounting issue can actually be a problem for older riders or people with other physical problems. Even a tree stump or rock isn't high enough to help you get on most horses comfortably. For riding on streets, it's also a safety issue. Trying to juggle a horse as well as a shovel in the presence of cars can get iffy if your horse is fidgety. And horse poop is too big to heavy in a little poop bag like for dogs.  For trails, though, it would be reasonable to require people to at least throw poop off the actual path. In our mounted patrol unit at my college, we keep a small dustpan tied to our saddles. If the horses poop on a sidewalk or road, we have to at least toss it into the grass or under a bush somewhere. The difference is that we have lots of fences or benches to remount with, and we're all young flexible college kids."
Horses,379ith,bearxfoo,1 point,Tue May 26 02:46:08 2015 UTC,"I see both sides. It's inconvenient and unsafe to have to dismount, but also inconvenient for everyone else to encounter a poo pile. Personally when I go off property for hacks we are in a group and the person with the smallest mount is designated poo picker. We just push it off to the side so no one steps in it. If I was on my own though I can't say I'd be as kind. Not worth my horse's back, though I always try as much as I can to stay off the middle of the path and basically in the bush."

Horses,372rw8,pilko1,7,Sun May 24 09:18:02 2015 UTC,"I'll offer up my 2 cents, however, please bear in mind that these can all be taken with a grain of salt depending on what discipline you have in mind for them :)  1)  Cons:  a bit short legged and long backed for my tastes.  I agree with Aktta who pointed out that she's downhill but this may be affected by the ground she's standing on.  Her front feet are also long in the toe - I would recommend getting a farrier to help re-shape her feet a bit.  She also might be a little camped under behind, but that also could be the ground.  Her shoulder and pastern have less of an angle than I prefer, she likely has choppy gaits.   Pros:  She's got a lovely head and a kind eye.  Her legs aren't crooked (at least not any more than any horse's.)  With farrier work to get her toes fixed, she would probably be well suited for any flat discipline.  She's got a well-sprung rib cage that I'm just a sucker for :)  2)  Cons:  The first thing I noticed is how woefully underdeveloped his top line is.  He looks like he's been ridden long and hard in a saddle that doesn't fit, and allowed to run around with his head up.  The first thing I would suggest doing is some chiropractic and ground work to start developing muscles on his top line.  (it would be easiest on him to start putting on muscle from the ground, first, then reintroduce a rider.)  With that being said, he's also a touch sway backed/ewe necked, which is adding to this impression.   Pros:  His toes are also a little long, but fortunately not growing forward yet like horse 1.  He's got decent legs, and I much prefer the angle of his shoulder and stifle.  If he was given the time to develop muscles in his tummy, back, and neck, he looks like he could do just about anything you asked of him."
Horses,372rw8,Confidence_Trickster,3,Sun May 24 12:24:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with the back issues on this one, it looks like he's been ridden in a saddle that didn't fit for a long time and has muscle atrophy.  It looks like he has a hunter's bump, and some past injury to his SI, the point of his hip looks like it has issues."
Horses,372rw8,Netflix4lfe,1 point,Sun May 24 16:00:25 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for such thoughtful insights and constructive feedback on how to proceed. Now off to the drawing board!
Horses,372rw8,Aktta,4,Sun May 24 21:49:12 2015 UTC,"The mare looks down hill (If you draw a line from the withers to the butt, it would be angled down instead of straight). It's sort of hard to tell if she's standing on even ground or not. The gelding's left hind leg looks odd. It might just be the lighting though. Is it swollen?   A farrier can do wonders! Looks like they have long hooves. If you can get pictures on a flat surface with them standing square that'd be more helpful for analysis.   Are these horses you're looking at buying?"
Horses,372rw8,AllKoopedUp,1 point,Sun May 24 09:57:08 2015 UTC,"2 friends bought them on a whim. We are trying to figure out their weaknesses and strengths so they can be built up to be good trail horses. You have a great eye (to notice the swelling, especially given the bright sun on the white sock), and will definitely discuss with the hooves with a farrier."

They're cute and stylish, but the mud never completely washes off and mine lasted 5 or 6 months before getting many many holes in them. If you want best bang for your buck I wouldn't recommend them. Have been considering trying muckboots brand, but I don't know what their longevity is."

I now have winter work boots from Muck and I love them, but I am searching for a summer work boot. Mucks are VERY sweaty when you wear them past like april haha"

Horses,372qov,Coopers_Hill,3,Sun May 24 08:56:47 2015 UTC,There seems to be a dismissal of solid flatwork in all the jumping vids you post.  What skills do you make sure horses and riders have in place prior to starting them over fences or giving them courses?
Horses,372qov,AtomicPenny,4,Sun May 24 12:02:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you, AtomicPenny, I agree, though this one was the most glaring for me.  Just because the pony CAN jump in that state doesn't mean he should be asked to.  I'm genuinely curious to see if you'll get a response."

The child riding gets his own lessons of a local professional, and has been riding for 4 or 5 years now.    We do school horses on the flat, but we are mainly a hunting yard so our focus tends to be road work, fitness, xc, hunting.  If you would like to help in their education on the flat we would love for you to pitch in. We will always welcome people to the yard to help even if its just to muck out, or help feed up."
Horses,372qov,AtomicPenny,5,Mon May 25 21:19:47 2015 UTC,"I love hunting and event, but good flatwork is a necessary base. EVERY discipline requires balance and security. You basically just said you skip a lot of that - you guys are just asking for injuries and problems to both horses and riders. It's apparent in the video neither horse nor rider has the skills necessary to do what they are being told to do.  Just my two cents."

Horses,36zblb,randomtimewarps,6,Sat May 23 12:01:50 2015 UTC,They're fed the same as any other horse (barring any medical issues of course). Just watch the volume of food and keep it tailored to their smaller size. They're adorable little gluttons and easy to overfeed!
Horses,36zblb,AtomicPenny,1 point,Sat May 23 13:05:00 2015 UTC,"Cool, thank you heaps :-)! The people that I bought him off told me that they only fed him Lucerne chaff and a carrot or two a day and didn't like that. So I will be feeding him all his herbs and vitamins then since I can pretty much keep his feeds the same as the others"
Horses,36zblb,acmspirited,5,Sat May 23 14:54:31 2015 UTC,"The issue is that ponies, especially minis, pack on weight like nobody's business and are prone to metabolic issues such as founder. Obesity is unhealthy in all animals so best to be avoided. If you're going to keep it on pasture then keep a close eye on its weight gain. Telltale signs are fat deposits along the crest of the neck, shoulders, and a really heart shaped booty. You should be able to feel the ribs on a horse in good weight but they should have a bit of padding over them.   Ok- laminitis. Metabolic founder can be insidious. Sometimes they flat out founder rocking back on their heels, rotating coffin bone, all that loveliness. Sometimes it's a very low level inflammation. Not enough to even notice. Starts as a bit of heat and maybe elevated pulses. I've come across horses who have lived liked this for YEARS and a dry lot changed their lives. Just keep an eye on your pony :-)"
Horses,36zblb,acmspirited,1 point,Sat May 23 13:12:10 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh, the founder is what I was worried about. I was told that eating too much chaff can cause it by a lady at one of my produce stores (dunno if she's right or not). And unfortunately that's all he was getting fed and a carrot or two a day and it is definitely not what I would consider a healthy feed.  I appreciate your help :-) I'm obviously new to owning ponies. Only ever had heavy horses and a few Tb's"
Horses,36zblb,horses_fart_on_me,2,Sat May 23 15:02:10 2015 UTC,I apparently neglected to mention that my ponies live out but whenever there's decent grass I have them in muzzles. If you keep your little one in a grazing muzzle you should be fine.
Horses,36zblb,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Sun May 24 02:15:48 2015 UTC,It does seem like a lot of food because it isn't.  A small pony should only be fed half the ration that a horse would. If given the option they will eat themselves overweight and founder. Free feeding a pony is always a bad idea.
Horses,36zblb,horses_fart_on_me,5,Sat May 23 15:17:23 2015 UTC,"Shit, probably less than half. At the height of spring, our ponies get only a literal handful of grain."

Maybe a handful of pony nuts if the other horses are having hard feed.  I think you should just keep an eye on his weight, I find that some ponies can control themselves even in good grass and some can't be left in the greener fields for more than a few hours.   I think you should be more concerned about laminitis than weight gain though. The minute one of my ponies looks a bit sore, he is taken off the grass and put on a strictly low-nutritional value hay diet!"

There are far more harsh bits out there that are hunter legal. It's just flexible so the horse can't grab hold of it as easily, but it forms to the mouth and moves a bit. Definitely less strong than a pelham and is often used as an alternative for horses that pull and lean."

Snaffles, pelhams and full bridles, all with cavesson nose bands, are required. a. Judges may penalize, but may not eliminate, a horse or pony that competes in an unconventional snaffle, pelham, or full bridle. Unconventional snaffles, pelhams, or full bridles include, but are not limited to, hunter gags, kimberwickes, etc. b. Judges must eliminate a horse or pony that competes in bits other than snaffles, pelhams or full bridles, and nosebands other than cavesson nosebands. Illegal bits include, but are not limited to, three rings, gags (other than the hunter gag), et cetera… Illegal nosebands include, but are not limited to, drop, flash and figure eight nosebands.   You can ""legally"" show in a waterford snaffle, but could be penalized since it is not conventional.

Horses,370ojv,ellevt,1 point,Fri May 29 20:13:51 2015 UTC,"One thing I've started paying attention to that I don't always hear talked about is the size of a horse's mouth... My horse has a very small, very shallow and narrow palate, so I had to start looking into bits that would fit in his mouth.  We tend to rotate bits, depending on how he's acting or what we want to work on, but I've chosen all of these because they are incredibly mild:  neue schule team up, myler comfort snaffle,  the happy mouth 'thin' version (don't know if these are still in production,) and the Herm Springer Duo, (as its thinner than a Nathe.)  You might have good luck if you ask your dentist when they come out for advice on a bit, as well.  Best of luck!"
Horses,370ojv,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Sat May 23 21:24:11 2015 UTC,"He prefers thinner bits for sure! I was thinking a waterford, but I might try him in a regular D first (I always use a D in the ring, I prefer the look) maybe even try a rubber D with a link in the middle. His dentist said he couldn't see anything wrong with his mouth and he has the ""ideal mouth"" so it's really just the horses preference now ha ha ha"
Horses,370ojv,mrflossin,0,Fri May 29 20:13:14 2015 UTC,"You're on the right track having his teeth checked. Next, check his palate because the ""thicker is softer"" doesn't apply if they have a low palate/thick tongue.   My suggestion is you try bits before buying them, horses have all sorts of individual tastes in bits, whether the width, the cheekpiece, or the mouthpiece itself. D rings, a favorite in hunters, are more stable in the mouth than a lose ring which your guy may prefer.   I've had great success with the Herm Sprenger bits, I use the KK Ultra loose ring on my young horse with great success. They are pricey, but they are so well made and absolutely ""get what you pay for"" type bits. They're contoured to the mouth, offer a wider range of sizes, and they don't pinch at the joints. You can find them used on Ebay for a better price and with a little elbow grease they clean up really nicely. Also I know Bit of Britain has a trial program if you're unable to borrow.   If your guy is still fussy, a mullen mouth bit may be the answer. I see the Nathe at all the top ""A"" hunter shows, but Herm Sprenger offers an alternative."
Horses,370ojv,mrflossin,0,Sun May 24 22:17:30 2015 UTC,"I personally love Boucher bits. I primarily ride Dressage and have recently started jumping my guy and this type of bit is just awesome. I also used KK bits in the past and they are wonderful as well. They are soft and come in a lot of different styles. I also have two friends that are eventers that use this type of bit, the boucher. The ability to have stability and softness is great, especially if your guy likes to be fussy. I have no idea if they are allowed to be in a hunter ring, so it may not be an option."

Horses,36ytyg,babysealsrule,2,Sat May 23 07:17:49 2015 UTC,"Don't let the dog near it. It's not that uncommon.

Horses,36ytyg,horses_fart_on_me,4,Sat May 23 15:39:21 2015 UTC,"It's hard to give you advice without knowing more about the horse and the specific situation. One of my horses hates dogs and will strike out at them if she feels the need. That is because I used to have her agisted at a center where the neighbors dogs would come over & chase the horses. I moved her when I found out but I also never take my dog into her paddock. However, she gives the dog fair warning (ears pinned, grumpy face) and the dog takes heed. It's never a case of her charging from a distance.  What should you have done when the horse charged? If it was not my horse I would GTF out of the paddock. If it was my horse I would send the dog out and do some work with the horse to remind it of it's manners. By work I mean I would move it's feet around for a while. I personally wouldn't use physical force like a whip or bullets for two reasons. Firstly it's not teaching the horse anything except to be scared of humans and this would probably make it attack more not less. Secondly, if you need a means to defend yourself from a horse then best to just not go near that horse.   For the future my advice would be stay away from that horse and especially don't take your dog into the paddock with it. Your post doesn't say if this is a horse you work with or ride and if that is the case then further action may be needed but if the horse is not your responsibility just let your grandpa know what happened and leave it to him."

Some horses just can't handle dogs, they might have been chased by them at some point in their lives or just never exposed to them properly. I would try not bringing your dog out there with you when you go to get the horse. It also probably needs respect for your space as u/AtomicPenny said. I'm guessing it's a combination of both."

Big, deep, angry, and a come to jesus moment if you feel that threatened like the horse will physically hurt you. Don't beat the hell out of the poor thing! But an angry ""No!"" and a good whack on the ass or shoulder for striking at you. Their attention spans are short, immediate reprimands are key, don't just punish because you are scared or for past transgressions.   Going after the dogs is something that doesn't bother me so much. Mine will charge them out of the paddock, if I am there the horses are like, ""Shit. Mom's watching! "" and tolerate them. Trails, aggressive strange dogs, coyotes....they can dislike dogs if they want, it could ultimately keep everyone involved safer. That he'll cut through you to get one is a huge problem however."
Horses,36ytyg,AtomicPenny,1 point,Sat May 23 11:02:09 2015 UTC,"I see three possible reasons.   Horse is an asshole. Training needed immediately, start carrying a dressage whip. Horse is terrified of dogs. Horse was going after the dog driven by fear and you were in the way. No fixing this, just keep dogs away from the horse. Horse is highly territorial. Correction needed. Training, carry a dressage whip. Try not to go in the field or stall with that horse much to avoid injury.   This is not your responsibility to take care of, you are still a beginner or amateur. I'm not being cruel, but this i above most peoples ability and experience to deal with. This is the owners problem."

Horses,36u43r,AtomicPenny,2,Fri May 22 12:29:41 2015 UTC,Hopefully he'll stay easy when we get dem nuts cut
Horses,36vx4h,HoarseHorseofCourse,4,Fri May 22 15:26:48 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I'd be in so much trouble if I didn't have my coggins saved as a PDF on my phone. I always forget that damn thing.
Horses,36vx4h,carbonarbonoxide,2,Fri May 22 16:39:18 2015 UTC,"Eh. What is the cost of the microchipping? Are there going to be random fees for them to scan my horse and run his info? What if the chip deepens and I end up having to produce documents anyway because they can't scan it? Then there is the risk of injury and scar tissue because they don't use the same placement system that they use in cats and dogs.  I'm paying for the vet to come out and do the tests whether they're chipped or not, it's no big deal to keep the paper with me showing that. 2 minutes to hand over a paper and let someone look at it isn't a huge hoop to jump through, I don't see how a chip would be a time saver or 'easier'.  Edit: I'd be more inclined to use chipping as a means for identification in the event of a stolen or lost horse (especially if I was somewhere like Oklahoma where a tornado could set a bunch of them loose) than I would simply for competition purposes."
Horses,36vx4h,AtomicPenny,1 point,Fri May 22 17:27:51 2015 UTC,The cost is generally $50 implanted and Show officials /USDA would incur the costs of scanning. The hoop jumping is in fact on the part of the inspectors as the number of undocumented/falsified EIA positive horses competing at shows/race has began to rise.
Horses,36vx4h,AtomicPenny,1 point,Fri May 22 19:22:03 2015 UTC,"Technically, horses could be positive even with a legit negative coggins report.  I could have my guys tested today, receive a negative, and have them contract it tomorrow and carry it to a show.  Unless every barn, every show, and every state line border tests in real time every time a horse pops up then positive guys are going to get through even without the lying forgers or solely using chips.  There is no efficient effective system beyond what is currently in place imo"
Horses,36vx4h,Orthonut,1 point,Fri May 22 19:34:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed, unfortunately people use that argument to justify using one Coggins for their entire barn."
Horses,36vx4h,RonRonner,2,Tue May 26 13:57:50 2015 UTC,All of mine are microchipped already. They get it when they get their foal kit shots.  Some are freeze branded and some are lip tattooed as well.  just depends on what they do and where they race/show
Horses,36vx4h,NeverendingStarchild,2,Fri May 22 18:02:22 2015 UTC,"FWIW, the KWPN switched to implantable microchips and there have been some issues with them, from ongoing irritation and scar tissue to issues with the chips migrating or becoming difficult to read.  This seems to be the most evenhanded article I've seen about it so far, there's some chicken little reactions out there too.  http://www.thehorse.com/articles/31549/microchip-safety-in-horses-evaluated (Sometimes this site gets hung up behind a paywall so I'm copying and pasting it for the discussion)   As microchipping becomes more prevalent in horses—and even obligatory in some countries—researchers are looking into the effects and usefulness of these foreign objects implanted into horses' bodies.  Microchip implantation appears to cause relatively little physical or physiological damage to horses, said Manuela Wulf, BSc, researcher at the Graf Lehndorff Institute for Equine Science in Neustadt, Germany. And for the most part, they’re a reliable source of identification, even if readability isn’t always 100%.  “Readability of the chip has a lot to do with the kind of scanner that’s used for reading, as well as how the chip was actually placed into the horse,” Wulf said.  In small animals such as cats and dogs, microchips are placed under the skin via injection. In horses, however, it’s critical that the microchip is placed into the neck muscle itself, said Wulf. “Even in small animals, microchips set under the skin can migrate,” she explained. “I know of a dog that was microchipped over the shoulder; six years later, that chip is now under his belly.  “With horses, you really need to have the microchip embedded into the muscle or the nuchal ligament where it’s far less likely to roam more than a few centimeters,” Wulf said. The nuchal ligament is a thick ligament located along the top of the neck, spanning from the poll to the withers.  Even so, muscle growth can cause the chip to end up deeper below the skin surface as the horse grows, and this can cause readability issues with certain kinds of scanners.  Basic scanners usually have a capacity to detect chips at a distance of up to 7 centimeters, she said. Considering that chips are usually embedded at approximately 2 to 3 centimeters below the skin surface, the basic scanners are frequently sufficient.  However, in a recent study she carried out using 428 microchipped horses, the basic scanner only detected 90% of the microchips, Wulf said. A larger, more advanced model of scanner capable of scanning at a distance of 12 centimeters could to detect all 428 microchips.  “Foals are usually 3 to 6 months old when they’re initially microchipped, and you can have a lot of growth and muscular buildup in the neck as they get older, bigger, and more athletic,” she said.  To determine physical effects of the microchip, Wulf and her fellow researchers also investigated 35 horses with microchips at necropsy following euthanasia. The microchips were covered by a thin capsule of fibrous tissue, sometimes with a minimal amount of inflammation, in most of the horses, she said.  Previous research led by Wulf and Christine Aurich, PhD, also of the Graf Lehndorff Institute and the University of Vienna, revealed that the implantation of a microchip caused minimal stress to foals.  “Provided breeders and veterinarians are properly educated in how to implant a chip and in how to read it, and knowing that sometimes a larger scanner is necessary, microchipping should certainly be considered a safe and reliable identification method for horses,” Wulf said.   Some more alarmist, less reliable sources (take with a grain of salt, however if I had a top, top international competitor like Anky or Sjef, I'd be concerned about complications from scar tissue in the nuchal ligament.  I wouldn't be thrilled)  http://arkansasanimalproducers.8k.com/whats_new_52.html  http://noble-leon.com/documents/FEI-Urged-to-Reverse-Mandatory-Horse-Microchipping.html"

Horses,36n4qy,dogartstudio,1 point,Wed May 20 16:29:55 2015 UTC,"I feel there's something cannibalistic for a horse to paint with that kind of brush. However, it is a really cool thing to see this kind of connection between the horse and his owner."

Horses,36pk86,Sweetmeatball,8,Thu May 21 02:39:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it is your decision, but the trainer you've been working with has known you and your ability the longest.   The person selling the pony doesn't matter - she won't be around for much longer, but it really does come down to you.  The arab sounds a little too much for you to start with.   Also think, if you're suddenly unable to use a trainer, how long would it be before you and the arab started to fight? Would you be able to handle her without any help?  Confidence breaking happens - and it happens quickly when you over-horse yourself.  You're starting a brand new adventure and have all the time in your life to find horses that will push you - for now, just start small and safely."
Horses,36pk86,showmebevelle,1 point,Thu May 21 02:54:22 2015 UTC,Thanks! I've been going crazy over here. My current trainer is really trying to push the pony on me and I just don't care for him. Oh and the owner is also a client of my trainers :/ lol. But those are really good points. I need a horse that's a little more my level. :)
Horses,36pk86,hoofbeats,3,Thu May 21 18:03:39 2015 UTC,"I would go with what your original trainer says about the mare. I've seen so many cases where the rider disregarded trainer advice because they really connected with a horse. One lady actually quit riding because her horse (though lovely and decently trained) was way too much horse. Another rider ended up with a horse that was unridable and unsellable. If you'd rather go with the new trainer, work with her for a while before going back to look at horses. She might like the mare, but she has no idea if you could handle her down the rode. Another piece of advice: unless you're experienced training horses, look for a horse you can ride confidently and without issues all by yourself. If you can only handle a horse during a lesson, why buy that horse? It's just another lesson horse at the point."
Horses,36pk86,hoofbeats,1 point,Thu May 21 15:17:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm startig lessons on the new trainer! I feel like I haven't been making much progress with my current one, and she kind of makes me feel like...shit idk, inadequate? Not that she'd ever mean to but she's a little snobby and comes off like she knows it all."
Horses,36pk86,RonRonner,1 point,Thu May 21 18:14:39 2015 UTC,If you feel as if you're not making progress change might be a good thing!
Horses,36pk86,RonRonner,3,Fri May 22 08:44:02 2015 UTC,"Adding another vote to passing on the mare and I love mares, Arabians and Arabian mares.  In fact, I've been leasing one for the last two years (she's far from my first Arab, I grew up on them too) and she's the apple of my eye but she's still an Arabian through and through, for better and for worse.  What are your goals for the future?  Do you want to stick with hunters? Because choosing an Arabian for open (not breed classes) hunter classes is trying to fit a square in a round hole.  Hunters want long sweeping strides, a quiet, steady rhythm and cute, even knees.  Arabs notoriously jump like deer (I can pick an Arabian a mile away in an over-fences picture--they have a very distinctive style.  It can be safe over low fences but is not a desirable style. They just haven't been bred for it) and quiet, long strides are not in their vocabulary.  Buy a horse for the job you want.  Also, a horse that sucks back and backs up at your leg at the trot is a problem you really don't want to fix.  Important rule number one in just about every equestrian sport is that a horse goes willingly when you put leg on them and turns/stops from gentle rein pressure.  Then you add on from that.  A horse that sucks back either has a big hole in the very foundation of its training or is sore or sour.  A greater than average amount end up rearers, since that's the natural escalation of an eff you response to leg pressure.  Change trainers if you feel it's the right move for you but I don't disagree with her assessment.  And keep in mind that she's probably owned many horses and helped connect many more owners to their first horses.  Trust her insight as someone with less emotional involvement than yourself (totally understandable!) because you're probably excited about this path and might be overlooking some plain truths because you're looking for your first horse."
Horses,36pk86,magicbearz,2,Thu May 21 18:03:41 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I was thinking about the backing up issue. I'm going to test out this new trainer starting this week. I do love jumping but I'm curious to check out other styles of riding. You definitely got it right that I'm excited. Its also been frustrating horse shopping. I've met some rude and shady people. But yore comment definitely helps me to keep a level head. :)
Horses,36pk86,AtomicPenny,3,Thu May 21 19:51:54 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad it could help!  Horse shopping is tough, no question about it.  The advice I tell everyone is to buy a horse that seems boring or too easy because honestly, no horse actually ends up boring.  It just means you can dedicate energy you would have spent trying to fix them on fun stuff like shows, or trips to the beach, or dabbling in different sports.  Buy a horse that fits you exactly this moment, not one that you think you could polish up into something great.  There are already so many variables and things that can go wrong--ask yourself if absolutely NOTHING changes about this horse, would you still want to buy it?"
Horses,36pk86,AtomicPenny,1 point,Thu May 21 20:08:42 2015 UTC,"I love that! Everything you said is gold. You're so right, no horse is boring. There's no reason to exhaust myself, learning how to care for a horse is my top priority. Then down the road I can get myself a little something fancier."
