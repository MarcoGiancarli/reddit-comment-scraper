ImaginaryForests,36f8wm,fireflycities,5,Mon May 18 22:47:26 2015 UTC,"Im assuming the poster knows Mushishi, but if anyone reading this every has the chance, they should definitely watch the show. It's filled with scenes that viscously compete for a level of beauty as this one. Beautiful art, beautiful storytelling; love it."
ImaginaryForests,36f8wm,-Exocoetidae-,3,Tue May 19 01:17:46 2015 UTC,"The description is ""mushishi illustration"", so I'm inclined to suspect they know the show. Still, I agreeâ€” even if you're not otherwise into anime, it's hauntingly beautiful and well worth watching."
