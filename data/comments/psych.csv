psych,3dru7z,Saint1121,9,Sat Jul 18 21:13:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of them showing Shawn knows a bunch of really random things about a lot of subjects, but not the rules that they may follow. Gus is the one who is based more on the logic and rules of things"
psych,3dru7z,tater2014,4,Sun Jul 19 03:01:28 2015 UTC,I got more annoyed at Juliet. The writers changed her entire personality episode to episode to fit the plot. Shawn at least is fun to watch.
psych,3dru7z,jaynesorangehat,2,Sun Jul 19 00:07:37 2015 UTC,"I noticed in the first season or so, Gus hasn't yet established the ""I'm a sympathetic crier Shawn"". He's just as confused by the crying person as Shawn is. I think the first episode (I may be wrong on this) he starts crying by the sight of someone else crying is the Santa Claus-con artist episode where the little girl comes in asking for their help bailing Santa out of jail.   All this to say- it doesn't really upset me though. I still love the show. The only thing I don't like is that shawns ""Gus don't just make up words"" joke was used just a little too often. Especially in the final season."
psych,3dru7z,lacrosseshot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:09:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah but at least once the sympathetic crier thing was established it stayed that way, a lot of Shawn's quirks appeared and disappeared during the same episode."
psych,3dru7z,loonybeans,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:33:26 2015 UTC,"That has always bothered me a little as well. In one episode Declan says something along the lines of Shawn being someone who purposefully does things so people don't see how smart he actually is. Maybe Shawn asking a question about vampires was to give the impression that he isn't very knowledgeable, but then later on we see that he actually is. Or as another person said, he just knows a lot of random stuff but he doesn't have in depth knowledge of all the rules and details. This would lead to him needing to ask Gus about something and then being able to operate off of his own knowledge from that point.  I think he likes to give Gus a hard time so he teases him about being uncool, even if it's something that he actually enjoys as well. Regarding the comic book convention specifically, going as a kid and going as an adult are two different things, and while Shawn may have enjoyed it when he was younger, he thinks it is embarrassing that Gus still goes."
psych,3dnt2s,righteous4131,33,Fri Jul 17 19:55:02 2015 UTC,Wasn't it that the lesbian softball players were sitting at a table and Shawn recreated the crime scene by placing food around the tables?
psych,3dnt2s,wandrngfool,24,Fri Jul 17 21:36:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm pretty sure everyone was a different food item or condiment, he just happened to refer to that couple as the lesbians."

Plus it let the writers give him the fun line: ""did you want to scoop out the last lesbian?"""
psych,3dnt2s,HalfMan-HalfDog,17,Sat Jul 18 03:00:25 2015 UTC,"I googled ""why are lesbians mashed potatoes"" (one of my weirder searches). According to Wikipedia https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(slang) mashed potato is a slang word for gay white guys that exclusively date other white guys but that's men.   According to urban dictionary httkp://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=masher (scroll down a little) a masher is an old term for lesbians that dress as men. However, I searched ""masher lesbian"" and found nothing.  So, I have no clue why mashed potatoes were used as lesbians.

psych,3djhro,Worcestershirejester,17,Thu Jul 16 19:45:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. As a Psych episode, the episode was pretty good. As the ending to my favorite storyline, I was pretty disappointed."
psych,3djhro,ManateeHill,13,Thu Jul 16 20:59:26 2015 UTC,"Kinda yeah. It wasn't my favorite storyline ending.   The one thing I liked from the conclusion was Gus' speech right before Yin was about to inject him. He's usually scared and freaks out but the only thing he could think to say literal seconds before death was to reassure his friend of everything they'd done TIL that point. Telling Shawn that it wasn't his fault, and that he'd do it all again if he could, etc. cause we all know Shawn would blame himself, and Gus did too. That part was kind of unexpected and I really loved it."
psych,3djhro,mwriteword,3,Thu Jul 16 20:19:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was a redeeming quality of the episode. It again shows why Shawn and Gus are as close of friends as they are and that they never regret their time together regardless of how ridiculous some of the stuff was that they made each other do."
psych,3djhro,bothan_spy_survivor,3,Thu Jul 16 20:49:44 2015 UTC,Played The Smiths which is always a positive!
psych,3djhro,TheAgentOfDoom,3,Thu Jul 16 21:15:44 2015 UTC,"I love the Yin/Yang episodes of Psych for the reasons you specified. Even though I loved Psych's comical approach to crime-fighting and mystery-solving, taking the series into a much darker direction worked out pretty well. It made those intense moments feel as they intended, only because the show generally doesn't tries to hit you where it hurts. So you knew the writers were serious when they went down that route. What a shame to end the trilogy the way they did, but there's always Gus' ""final words"" to Shawn that make up for it and Shawn angrily reacting to the thought of his friend getting killed. Very important moment for the two of them, I think"
psych,3djhro,fallenelf,2,Fri Jul 17 00:47:47 2015 UTC,"The first episode was the only good one.  The entire point (imo) of using Yin and Yang was to show the relationship between good and evil.  Yang is evil, but has this inherent need to make her murders involve childish or playful games.  This shows the playfulness inside the killer.  A little Yin inside the Yang.  Shawn is supposed to be Yin, there shouldn't have been another person.  He's the hero, steadfastly good and goofy.  However, our hero has a secret that could bring harm to himself and his best friend.    Yin and Yang, Shawn and Yang.  A hero with a secret and a immature/playful villain.  This was the set up, which was great.  Force the goofy hero to find his inner seriousness.  Juxtapose this set up with an evil villain who has childlike wonder in the murders she commits.  I've written on this sub many times about how this is really the spiritual ending of Psych, and how after this the show became fairly different in tone and quality.  The Yang story should have been Shawn's Reichenbach, defeating his greatest foe, and unlike Holmes, living happily ever after.  All of the conflicts introduced at the beginning of the series were settled and all of the pieces had fallen into place for Shawn to get the girl, get the respect of his peers, and come to terms with his parent's divorce.    Instead, we get forced drama (not ending up with Juliet at the end of the episode, especially when the romantic sub plot with Abigail was settled in the HS episode!) and 2 largely inferior sequels to a great series cap."
psych,3djhro,GetMoneySmokeWeed,2,Fri Jul 17 16:04:11 2015 UTC,"The only reason I didn't like it is because I cottoned on to what the blonde woman was doing from the beginning! I did however think that Yin was quite pathetic tbh, he's just an old man. That's it. He wasn't even sub-intelligent, I do feel like they cheated us a bit with the ending actually."
psych,3djhro,UruguayanKoddok,2,Sat Jul 18 11:03:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with OP and the overall sentiment here, but I'd like to add that I was extra disappointed because Peter Weller is such an incredible actor, and a force on screen. And I think they could've done more with him. It was a fine episode, but didn't live up to the first two Yin-Yang episodes, and that Weller wasn't given enough or good enough material made it even a little more disappointing to me."
psych,3djhro,gfoster18,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:02:00 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. The other thing is that at the end of the episode when Shawn and Gus think they're life is about to end, it isn't really that suspenseful because they obviously aren't going to kill of the main two characters of the show.

I also believe it's just the cameras, I don't think it was intentional because it does change later on in the series when they switch to HD. Probably due to budgeting reasons or something, which I didn't mind too much which is surprising because normally I'm a quality snob."

psych,3d6t3c,Duese,7,Tue Jul 14 01:25:35 2015 UTC,I agree. I had trouble finishing season 7 and 8. Didn't think the final seasons were terrible at all they just weren't as good as the older ones.
psych,3d6t3c,KevinsAGirl,10,Tue Jul 14 01:20:28 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. I stopped watching after the remake of ""Cloudy With A Chance of Murder"" because honest I feel like they took one of my favorite episodes and dumbed it down. I only owned the first season for a very long time so I know the episodes by heart. Cloudy was great because there was so much nuance to be had with each time you watch it. There was the great tension with Jules, the amazing bromance before it dumbed down Shawn and Gus. Personally I think the entire show got bogged down in trying to keep running jokes going and trying to keep a good thing rolling. Shawn and Gus were smart at the start, and that's what gave them their flair. Lassiter was a good cop who hated shenanigans. There was no predictably dumb Woody.  I eventually plan to finish the show because I've seen it mentioned plenty of times that the ending is worth the watch. I just think it fell apart at the end."

psych,3d6t3c,Delta-07,4,Tue Jul 14 06:06:55 2015 UTC,"Every show, given enough time, will go from character driven to caricature driven.  The thing is systems crave stability, while drama is all about instability, so dramas have to work themselves out.  Since shows generally are just starting to get successful and everyone involved is just starting to make some real money when the conflict would reasonably wrap itself up, they flatten the characters so they can be whatever they need for whatever story you want to tell.  Really, Psych could have ended after Season 4.  That said, the thing with Psych is it wasn't driven by character drama, it was more about having a fun cast to watch.  So while the stories kept getting worse, it didn't really matter all that much until really far towards the end.  Like I haaaaaaated that Think Tank episode.  Even with the drop off towards the end, they stayed true to form and had a quirky take on jumping the shark.  That Bruce Campbell episode at the end, with Gus's weird dreams, that's not only one of my favorite episodes of Psych, that's one of my favorite TV episodes of any show.  And the last episode, while trying at times, had glimpses of dark comic genius."

psych,3d6t3c,tbos92,2,Tue Jul 14 03:42:08 2015 UTC,Season 6 was my favorite season. Season 7 was great too. Season 8 was the only one I didn't like but I understand why I didn't like it. I didn't think it was carried out too much.
psych,3d6t3c,Johnie4usc,2,Tue Jul 14 03:29:16 2015 UTC,I always feel the opposite on things like this. When I find a show I really like I want it to keep going for as long as possible. If it gets bad nobody is going to force me to watch it and the good episodes will still be good.
psych,3d6t3c,isamlegend,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:38:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, much as i hate to admit it. I still loved the characters, but the show lost it's way in the last couple of seasons. I thought they did a nice job with the finale, though."
psych,3d6t3c,janetplanet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:33:21 2015 UTC,yes. sadly anything after season 5 is hit or miss. seasons 1-3 are my favorite.
psych,3d6t3c,zuggles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:47:02 2015 UTC,I binged watched the show through 3 times and I am disappointed every time I get to that last episode. I honestly wish it would have continued longer.
psych,3d6t3c,alphawolfpup,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:56:23 2015 UTC,"Yea, at some point in the series they switched it from goofy murder mystery show, to quirky romance-drama.   They used his psych sense less and less, then more and more episodes pushed the murder mystery to the back seat and highlighted more Shaun and Jules relationship.   I got into the show because of it's original wacky and fun format. But I stuck around til the end because I still loved the show. I knew it was coming though. As soon as it was leading up to him telling Jules I figured ""Well now it's only Lassie that is out of the loop pretty much, and the show doesn't seem like it can keep going if most people knwo the one thing the show was based off of."""

psych,3d6t3c,OnionND,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:56:44 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that, as a general rule, most shows peak in one or two early seasons and peter out after six seasons. It's not hard and fast, but most of my favourite shows have a distinct drop in quality outside of the six best seasons. I hadn't really thought about it in terms of Psych before, but if the rest of the subreddit is anything to go by, I'd say it fits here too."
psych,3d6t3c,StrategicSarcasm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:20:30 2015 UTC,season 7 and 8 are mostly skips for me minus a few very good episodes here and there.
psych,3d6t3c,pro_calvinballer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:49:00 2015 UTC,"I'd say it ran a little too long insofar that they, in a magical world, could've taken the best of seasons 7 and 8 and made a pretty strong final season. But, compared to most other long running shows (simpsons, x files, and how i met your mother come to mind), I'd say they didn't drag it out for too terribly long."
psych,3d4anv,FranklinFox,84,Mon Jul 13 12:15:45 2015 UTC,He gets to be a more sympathetic character as you move on.  He's not intentionally being an asshole.  Shawn is just a very difficult person to deal with and his dad is way past being sick of it.
psych,3d4anv,DBuckFactory,49,Mon Jul 13 13:41:31 2015 UTC,"It's not just that though. The show does a pretty good job of establishing over time that Shawn's dad wants what's best for him, but clearly doesn't really know how to be a normal loving supportive father. Everything he does has to be a lesson or exercise. As he starts to get older and spend some time with his adult son, he stars to try harder to be just open and loving. Unfortunately, shawn can't really handle that level of communication."
psych,3d4anv,highphive,12,Mon Jul 13 15:48:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is also true.  He's a ""man's man"" police guy, so it fits the character well."
psych,3d4anv,DBuckFactory,18,Mon Jul 13 17:49:40 2015 UTC,Shawn's dad? You mean Talmage Mcgulager.

psych,3d4anv,keenan123,17,Mon Jul 13 22:42:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, Henry's character becomes more rounded and likable over time. He really just wants Shawn to be a responsible adult. Pretty much all of the characters develope and grow as the show progresses. In the later seasons, there is some faltering, but stick it out to the end - it's worth it."
psych,3d4anv,janetplanet,15,Mon Jul 13 15:47:56 2015 UTC,Oh yeah. I'm rewatching the series and yes the change is very apparent
psych,3d4anv,Dreql,12,Mon Jul 13 12:53:38 2015 UTC,"Henry is awesome. There's more context to the way he behaves in the beginning, plus he mellows out a bit once he sees how well his son is doing throughout the series."
psych,3d4anv,rolls20s,6,Mon Jul 13 16:45:26 2015 UTC,"I urge you to wait until the Third Season Episode ""Ghosts.""   I think it was the turning point where Shawn, and the audience begins to see Henry in a whole new light."
psych,3d4anv,TwirlyNinja,5,Mon Jul 13 18:56:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely that. I know it's a comedy, but this scene was pretty emotional too. For the viewer, your view of Henry completely does a 180 and you get to see Shawn's preconceived notions about his father destroyed in seconds. It was surprisingly hard hitting."
psych,3d4anv,83alx,6,Mon Jul 13 19:32:19 2015 UTC,"Yes. It becomes pretty clear that while both Shawn and Henry love each other, they both have very different ideas of how that should be expressed. Not to mention they both want what's best for Shawn, except they do not come close to seeing eye to eye on what that is.  Shawn is also a bit of an irresponsible jerk too, but he's the main character do we kind of love him off the bat, and do Henry seems worse by default."

psych,3d4anv,jrogue0_o,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:31:42 2015 UTC,I liked Henry at the beginning. As the seasons go along they changed his character. Specifically: spoiler  I'm almost finished with season 5. Watched this show when it came out years ago but never made it past season 3 due to losing out on cable.

psych,3cp94v,asciident,11,Thu Jul 9 19:57:36 2015 UTC,Exactly. The show is goofy and light hearted for the most part. Those brief moments when Shawn is serious are so polarizing and real. I love em.

Not only does this make the dangerous situations hilarious to watch, but lightens up the show a bit. It's easy to pull out a gun when things get hairy; but it's funnier to see Shawn and Gus argue and fight like children to get out of trouble.

psych,3bkaxt,grobo555,3,Mon Jun 29 23:58:01 2015 UTC,"I considered it non canon until I heard Lassie say that. It's just that Anne Dudek was going to have the main spot until Maggie Lawson got it, and pilots are only shot to see if the producers like it."
psych,3bkaxt,LevynX,8,Tue Jun 30 00:12:22 2015 UTC,Pilots are generally shot way before the rest of the season and before a show finds its identity. Shawn being a good shot is something explored in the pilot and then abandoned as it didn't really fit Shawn's character. Lassie's partner was axed and Juliet brought in because it was also better for the show. The pilot set a lot of standards but it has to be taken with a grain of salt as a lot of things were changed or abandoned.
psych,3bkaxt,janetplanet,8,Tue Jun 30 12:52:50 2015 UTC,"I think being a good shot fits Shawn's character perfectly. I couldn't see him owning a gun based on his character, but I couldn't see him not being proficient when given a gun, either."

The penultimate episode had no plot that carried over to anything, they completely and totally glossed over the fallout after the reveal of Shawn's secret, which was what the whole show had been building up to for seven seasons.

Yin is getting the needle ready, Gus is telling Shawn it's ok, that the has no regrets, and Shawn just has nothing. For maybe the first time in the show, Shawn just seems out of plays. There's no back pocket trick, no stalling for the cops, just desperation. I watched it as it came out and never really read anything about it online or whatnot, so I didn't know if there was another season, or if Dule Hill maybe wasn't on it if there was (not that you could have psych without him), but more than that, I was just so in the moment. Looking back at it now, it's obvious that Gus would never die, as the show is at its core about Shawn and Gus, so I think it's mostly a testament to how well that moment was done. Sure, if I'd thought it about for even a second, I would have realized ""of course he lives!"" but in that moment it wasn't a show where actors have contracts and the good guys win, it was just a dangerous serial killer about to kill another victim--a friend of ours this time.  For santabarabatown i intentionally avoided any news that might tell me if Corbin Bernson was coming back for the next season ..."

Only that one haircut when it was crimped or curled or whatever you call it, in my opinion really was not flattering.  Lassy-Dude just looked incredibly suave basically the whole way through but almost more so in the later seasons. He really pulled off the pompadour with his hair. There are a few episodes in 7-8 when you really see the grey which made him look a lot older but again still looked good.

I didn't like the way Shawn's hair was styled in season 8, but Juliet's hair was looking pretty good after season 1-2 except that brief curly period in season 7, which I didn't think flattered her much.  Costume design changed slightly after the first couple of seasons, too."

psych,37ilvg,kingofstillwater,6,Wed May 27 22:14:50 2015 UTC,"They don't seem out of order to me. Aside from Remake, which is a goofy one-off, the first set of episodes deals with Interim Chief Trout. Cog Blocked is Gus-centric and doesn't deal much with the arc about the department shuffle. The next 3 episodes do deal with Vick's and Juliet's departures and Lassiter's promotion. Nightmare is mostly just a horror homage for fun, but does touch on the decreasing need for Psych's services at the department. And the finale is all about Shawn and Gus moving on.  The only episode in the series that is out of order is Psych: The Musical because it was written to run mid-season 7 but ended up being aired as the last 2 episodes of the season so there are continuity problems."
psych,37ilvg,asciident,3,Thu May 28 02:51:39 2015 UTC,"You may be a bit confused because of how season 7 ended.

""Who Ya Gonna Call?"" is the 7th episode of Psych's first season and it deals with Shawn and Gus investigating a haunting, which in the end turns out to be a secondary personality of a man with dissociative identity disorder.  It's very important to remember that while Robert was an ordinary and harmless person, his alternate personality Regina tried to have his male genitalia removed and his third personality, Martin Brody, committed murder to prevent Regina from achieving her goal.

Plus the writing and especially banter can be done rather quickly (which makes sense in the context that they do it), which means some of the jokes might get lost in translation. At least upon the first few viewings."

After Geronimo's retirement, the remaining cast members formed The Mike O'Meara Show. In the later years, the show was carried on 20-30 stations across the United States by the CBS-owned Westwood One Radio Network. The show's flagship station was 106.7 WJFK in Washington DC. In 2007 the show ranked #66 in the Talkers Magazine Heavy 100.  The show's last live regular episode with Don Geronimo was broadcast March 13, 2008. Don Geronimo hosted a farewell show April 11, 2008.  The show debuted on WAVA in 1985 as The Morning Zoo with Don and Mike.

Detective Barry only appeared in the pilot, but they at least give a reason for her to leave and it could probably be justified by conflicting schedules and so on. I know how shows work, sometimes the pilot doesn't get picked up for years, sometimes it never gets picked up at all. Some actors just can't return.  This person...I'm not even sure we're ever told her name, appears at some point halfway through season 1, and then nothing. We're never told she left or anything, and there's no reason for the actor to have left. That means half of the main characters are in on the con, one blatantly disbelieves it, and two just sort of go along with it for plot reasons. There aren't any major characters that give the feel that they're the type of person who would fall for the whole psychic act."

I have a huge interest in TV and believe I like good quality stuff that is far ranging, everything from Pretty Little Liars to Seinfeld to Breaking Bad to Psych to Hannibal to Venture Bros. Yet the thing about Psych is it's ability to be so funny and interesting while being a procedural and having more character development is so incredible. To walk the fine line of easy to watch but not be fluff either. All while being in the hour long format is so rare. Which is a shame because I want to really like other similar shows but they just aren't as good, Castle/Chuck/etc/ they are decent shows I just can't get into them.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer is sort of like that, but not as good as Psych though. To me anyway."

Since the description says that James Roday wore the shirt on the show, I'm gonna assume it was made after I searched for it.   I even went through the effort of finding the old logo, but couldn't find it in green, so I changed the color in photoshop and used one of those ""create your own t-shirts"" websites and it ended up costing more than $16. Good to know that they have that now, because the print is wearing off and I might need to get him a replacement soon!"
psych,342hre,brazil201,29,Mon Apr 27 20:06:23 2015 UTC,"pretty sure in a mid season episode, one were Henry is the Advisor for the department on when to use outside help,i.e. Psych, Shawn was talking about getting his check, Pretty sure it was 1500, and I think I believe, that in regards to that number Shawn saying something about how it's half what they usually make per case for the dept. Henry says something about how he didn't really do anything for that particular case and thats why its less. It was a pretty innocuous scene, pretty easy to miss if you're not looking for it.   Also I think they make different amounts depending on the case type/severity thing. Remember when Gus and Shawn are thought to be targets from a case they accepted and got paid for despite not working on the case. Gus is angry because Shawn accepted the money because he never told Gus about it. When Gus finds out first he asks how much, and Shawn says something like ""IDK like 600 dollars"" or something, later it turns out to be more i want to say 1100.  Then you can think of the Thane case who promises them 10% of his 100,000 restitution for being wrongly convicted. So 10,000 dollars and they were ecstatic about that.  I think it's reasonable to assume they charge between 500 and 5,000 per case for themselves and probably get paid 2-4,000 per police case (on average) as they are usually harder, but also more reliable and consistent revenue stream. Also it's probably ok to assume they both have a lot of their expenses paid by customers, so tons of write-offs there and that is something Gus would be amazing at doing.  Another thing is Shawn is clearly shown throughout several episodes as doing tons of petty smaller cases even though Gus doesn't like it. I actually really like these little parts and references throughout as it does a few things. Shows how they aren't just completely bankrupt, shows how Gus' other job comes into play, also shows a good dimension to Shawn's character as someone who clearly has found something he likes doing as he is putting in extra effort towards work which is clearly not something Shawn normally does for anything. He is pretty much always the one who says yes to a case and would probably if money wasn't an issue say yes to just about every case that comes Psychs way  They are clearly good and so get a lot of word of mouth and so they get a lot of customers, and solve relatively quickly (just going off what peripheral comments we hear in the series). The funny thing being that they are both somewhat inexperienced and slightly reckless with management. Though Gus certainly keeps everything from falling apart. What I mean is because they are good they won't go bankrupt, but their charging fees (again from what we see in the show) are all over the place. They'd just as soon do a case for 100 boxes of Red Vines as 20,000 dollars.  It's fun to think about but I think that seems to be about the size of it.   In my opinion anyway."

psych,33fcyi,Mikey358,5,Wed Apr 22 13:24:07 2015 UTC,"to go off all you guys.   the banter almost makes sense for who they are as characters to do, like it's a defense mechanism. several episodes in the first few season actually do a good job of making it so that makes sense Gus doesn't have to be at his job all the time.  2 biggest examples being, when Gus was on a retreat to get a big client worth X percentage of his salary and Shawn helps him in the end of the episode get that client, so right there he gets a huge client that also doesn't take much of his time. Second when Gus' boss needs Psych to help out and Shawn was behind it and realizes Gus' boss was doing something illegal basically made him agree to allow Gus to get a raise, not get in trouble, and continue with Psych.   Honestly I'm pretty impressed with how they did all that to show you why they don't need to show Gus doing his job. On top of that he is always referencing his job so you know he thinks about it, is always taking tests and giving people his card. AND even still I like that why they do shy away from it in later seasons the joke made in season 7 or 8 can't remember exactly Gus says something about his sales job and Shawn's just like ""You still do that?"" or ""You still have that job?"".  My biggest S.of.Disbelief is O'Hara being so surprised and angry at Shawns revelation he was a fake. I know she has a big thing with trust, but she had to know he wasn't a psychic, she had to just pretend so much wasn't in front of her face from the beginning before her and shawn were anything really."

Some people are willing to believe in that stuff, and Jules always seemed like one of them.  And, in her place, I would have expected the ""I'm not psychic"" talk to be one of the first ones after starting a relationship.

psych,33fcyi,Rooibosisboss,2,Thu Apr 23 00:22:39 2015 UTC,Yeah the pharmaceutical rep is pushing his/her stuff on the doctor so that the patient is prescribed that reps drugs. So marketing to the patient is done on television and radio and the such so that you tonal your doctor and that maybe the next time that doctor is talking to the pharmaceutical rep he might say oh hey what's the deal with drug z...  And yeah there are brand name drugs. In the states when a new drug is made the maker of the drug holds the patent. When the patent expires everyone can give it a go more or less. So when you go to your doctor you get to ask for which ever your name brand viagra or the offshoot of it that probably does the same thing.

Still though, as a law student, sometimes I just want to yell ""Shut up!!!!!"" to the criminals as they corroborate everything Shawn has accused them of.  Also, the fact that Shawn and Gus break into places all the time and no one has a problem with it. In the later seasons, they start breaking tons of windows to break into homes, warehouses, etc. and no one cares.

psych,32oiu9,vanillacupcake4,2,Tue Apr 21 00:10:12 2015 UTC,"Love this episode, one of my favorites because of the atmosphere created throughout"
psych,32n0ml,NintendoNerd16,27,Wed Apr 15 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"I think Lassiter crushing the DVD before Shawn comes clean was very moving. I was in tears. The rest of the episode, eh."
psych,32n0ml,NoBallNorChain,23,Wed Apr 15 03:54:32 2015 UTC,I liked the last episode because it was a wrap up of their escapades in Santa Barbara while also saying good bye to SB and everyone there and also creating a new beginning to their lives in San Francisco.
psych,32n0ml,imbreaststroke,16,Wed Apr 15 03:17:14 2015 UTC,"I was also looking for the same thing, but where I disagree with you is that I think they did accomplish all of this.   Finale full of flashbacks: Alright, no actual flashbacks, but certainly used every inside joke it possibly could. Close enough.   EDIT: After hitting submit, I realized something. This whole episode is set up to make us believe that we are watching a finale full of flashbacks, which has come to be the norm with long running shows. The whole time, we think Shawn is telling the story with flashbacks. It's only when we get the line, ""I guess what I'm saying... is that I'm sorry Gus"" that we realize that we aren't the ones he is talking to. He's talking to Gus. And in that aspect, Psych follows the precedent of finale flashbacks while putting their own spin on it. Now back to your featured presentation.  Guest Characters: We got Bud from The Cosby Show and Val Kilmer as Dobbson. Only two, but those are two BIG fan service guest appearances.  Plot referencing the first ever(?) episode:    LASSITER: I did. I checked out a whole lot of stuff. Like, oh, you're currently unemployed. (opens folder on table and sits) You've never held a job for more than six months. And you have a criminal record.  SHAWN: I was 18.  LASSITER: Oh. 18? Well, that makes it okay. Let me just scratch this out.  SHAWN: (looks at LUCINDA) I borrowed a car.  LASSITER: You stole a car.  SHAWN: To impress a girl.   The whole thing involving the driver's ed car is a callback to the first few minutes of the pilot. Not the entire plot of the finale, but it is involved in most of the plot.  Satisfying ending where he really tells them he's a phony: For me, this was THE most satisfying way to do this. Sure, he doesn't tell Vick, but I'm 99% sure she knew since the start. If he definitely tells her, they both know that he can't work for her and countless cases will have to be thrown out. Lassie is the only other person who I felt needed to know or deserved to know. And Shawn told him in the DVD. But in the most satisfying twist, Lassie chooses not to listen, ejects the DVD, and snaps it in half. Yeah, he always had a feeling and hated Shawn for it early on. But now, they're friends and he sees that Shawn never had any malicious intent towards Lassie. If anything, the problems Lassie faced because of Shawn's actions only happened because Lassiter tried to book Shawn for the theft in the first episode. Out of all the points that you were looking for, I think this was the one that they hit out of the park.  TL;DR: I wanted the same things as you, but I feel like we got all of this and more."

This whole time I was watching the show, I had in mind this awesome finale, but they kinda threw a curveball. I'm still not going to say it was my all time favorite episode, and am still bummed we didn't get good callbacks, but it was a satisfying ending. And you can't ask for much better than that."
psych,32n0ml,mbgith,2,Wed Apr 15 20:00:48 2015 UTC,"""The whole thing involving the driver's ed car is a callback to the first few minutes of the pilot."" --   Except, there's an episode (I forget which) when in the cold open, Henry calls in that he and his partner had found 'the stolen vehicle' and then he interrupts (a 16? 17?) year old Shawn making out with a girl in a Mustang. She says ""we just borrowed it from my neighbor. We were going to bring it back!"" I think the Mustang incident is when Shawn stole the car and Henry busted him, not him taking the drivers' ed car... so not  call back to the pilot. (I know.  Minor point. I liked the finale.  But I liked ""1967 a psych odyssey"" better from a feels point of view)."

psych,32n0ml,pepelogoo,5,Wed Apr 15 22:54:32 2015 UTC,"Why would you want flashbacks in the final episode? I'd rather spend the last time with these characters on new material instead of things we've already seen. Also, Psych is a comedy first and foremost, so they were wise not to open the can of worms that would've ensued if Shawn told everyone he was a fraud. There's no way that could've been resolved in a single episode.  The last season was hit and miss, but the finale was a great conclusion to the series. Using Billy Zane and Deon Richmond as guest stars was brilliant. Lassie finally having the proof he's wanted all these years and deciding he didn't need it. Gus realizing he'd rather keep solving crimes with Shawn instead of having a 9-to-5 job. So much good stuff."

psych,3121fa,adamtouchet,2,Wed Apr 1 19:22:28 2015 UTC,"Repost of a comment from about a week ago  I have a few recommendations for similar shows:  Brooklyn Nine Nine- Andy Samberg, Terry Crews, Joe Lo Truglio, and Chelsea Perretti star in this one. A buddy cop show that is pretty hilarious.  The Good Guys- Another funny buddy cop show that was far too short lived with one season. Decently long season though, I absolutely loved this show. Stars Colin Hanks alongside the bad guy from Billy Madison. A rookie do-it-by-the-books cop gets paired up with a has-been who does things his own way. Highly recommend, was on Netflix in the US, not sure if it still is.  The Finder- It is a show about a man who has a special skill of finding people, and does so with his friends. Pretty funny but another short lived show at just one season. Not as good as the other two suggestions (and definitely no Psych) but still worth the watch. Still on Netflix last I checked.  White Collar was also mentioned, I watched a lot of it and it was ok, had a hard time staying interested. I may have binge watched too much in a short period of time, I think that's why I got a little burned out on it. Worth the watch though, you can always ditch it if you don't like the first few episodes. I liked it and will probably pick it up again soon.  Chuck is another one I would like to mention. Very funny, it is spy related instead of police related and the friendships in that one really draw you in too. In fact, maybe put this one at the top of the list, it is genuinely a great show IMO. Great soundtrack too and good acting for a lot of people you probably haven't seen much of. Plus the female lead is gorgeous, so, there's that too.  Hope that helped, but you can always rewatch Psych!"

psych,30uvn5,HexedMonkey,39,Mon Mar 30 22:15:24 2015 UTC,"2 of my favorite shows mashed together. If there were to be a crossover with any 2 shows, I'd choose Psych and Supernatural.   Dean and Sam are following up on a lead about a string of murders in the Santa Barbara area.  Shawn does what Shawn does and is also investigating the case. They cross paths when Sam & Dean pose as FBI agents looking for some info on the case and Shawn discovers their ruse.  They confess to not being FBI agents but also determine that Shawn is no real psychic.  They work together as a means to keep their true ""identities"" under wraps. Normally Shawn & Gus would totally be down for some supernatural theories to a string of murders (Bigfoot & Vampire episodes), but are highly skeptical when Sam & Dean explain what is really happening.  They eventually do their research and find clues, which leads them to the bad monster's hideout.  Somehow Shawn and Gus get split up from Dean & Sam who find the bad monster-murderer guy and kill ""it"" in the special way determined by the lore.  When Shawn & Gus catch up, the monster has reverted back to human form and is lying dead on the ground.  Shawn gets all smug ""I told you so"" when he finds a dead ""human"".  Sam & Dean don't fight the situation and let Shawn & Gus go on believing that their are no such thing as bad monster-murderer-creatures (except vampires, bigfoot, mummies, & aliens).   Other things that happen during the episode: Classic Shawn/Gus Shenanigans, Juliet thinks Dean is smoking hot, Lassie is unnerved that Shawn gets to work with the ""FBI"", Dean&Sam believe Shawn to be an actual idiot and are amazed that he has solved so many murders, They wonder what Gus brings to the table, The Super Sniffer reveals a big clue to what they are actually hunting, and Gus is subscribed to some obscure magazine that becomes relevant for the hunt."

psych,30uvn5,Cpist,2,Thu Apr 2 04:13:29 2015 UTC,I didn't specify where in either timeline the crossover show would take place. Also the general public in the show still believes he's a psychic.

I just watched it for the first time (I have a hard time with closure too, it's been on my DVR for 1yr and 3 days) and Gus came into the Psych office and met up with Shawn's dad and he said ""You got a dvd too?"".  I was under the impression he got one, we just didn't get to see it."

psych,30k5eq,Ch1pp,3,Mon Mar 30 23:07:10 2015 UTC,"Apparently they had to cut out the theme tune just so that they could get all the stuff they wanted into the show. If they were that short for time I guess it's not surprising that some things, like seeing his Dad watch a DVD, got cut. I still thought it was a great finale though."
psych,30k5eq,dougbaker45,0,Wed Apr 1 21:04:14 2015 UTC,I think the dad dvd would have been better than the detective he never spoke to bit.

psych,3097xc,Rooibosisboss,6,Wed Mar 25 14:37:47 2015 UTC,"so great and I love the joke this becomes (shawns first reaction to mary anyway) in the later Yang episode when they're like Shawn how could you not have psychically know the killer was Mary. Gus is just like ""Actually he did, that was the first thing he said"" and it flashes back to this episode and Shawn's just like ""He's the killer"". Those are his first words about him. Great use of flashback and if they planned ahead for that joke than amazing foresight and fore-planning.  some of my favorite quotes  Shawn: Gus, don't be the last of the international playboys.  .............................................................  Shawn Spencer: Mary, I'm surprised it took you so long. You seem so spry.  Mary: Ankle weights. I always wear 'em, even when I sleep. Read about it in Men's Fitness. Totally reinvigorated Ryan Reynolds' career. .............................................................  lastly, I can't remember the entire quote, but when they go to visit  Yang in the mental institution and the lady bringing them in the white overcoats is saying something like ""yea we have to keep her in a white room because other colors get her unruly so you should be fine"" and Gus in his kinda typical nervous scared voice is just like ""what about my face""."

In honor of such a well-loved episode I wanted to start doing my point-by-point review thing that I haven't done a lot of recently, but I can't really break down the episode without just repeating how cool everything is. Shawn steadily getting more ""broken"" (in this case it basically just means him taking things seriously for once) by finally meeting his match, Gus' awkward attempts to lighten the tension, it all works together as a functional whole, not a lot of individual moments to talk about."

However re-watching it always breaks my heart when spoiler Mary is definitely one of my favourite characters, and it was so awesome to see him.

Im a huge fan of Tim Curry and this episode gave me some of my favorite Psych lines. Shawn Spenstar  and Gus TT Showbiz made me lose my shit! The musical performance at the end was hilarious and actually pretty great. I felt like the actors enjoyed it! I loved the first season of Psych and after this episode I was willing to dedicate my Friday nights from then on out (till it was moved to Wednesdays). I read a bit about the reception of this episode and I guess people found it underwhelming and it made Monk that night seem like gold. But forget those haters, Psych for life and American Duos to me is a Psych classic!"

psych,2zys6b,NintendoNerd16,5,Fri Mar 27 00:54:38 2015 UTC,"First. good idea for a topic. If you don't mind I'd like to talk more as a seasonal basis.  I feel like people are saying ones that most people like, so I'm not sure that they really could be considered underrated.  but anyway for me personally  Basically season 4 overall.  it may actually be the most consistent season (or one of the most), but it just doesn't have season 2 and 3's amazing eps. which I could never take away.  It feels like the most ""pure"" season if that makes sense.  I feel like it's the season no one hates, but no one puts as their first. Myself included, but i feel like that is what underrated is.  Most of the other seasons have the crazy amazing super fantastic episodes, but have more miss-fires as well.  I mean we're talking psych here so when I say hit or miss I only mean for a psych episode. Almost any psych episode compared to other tv is still excellent.  Season 1- Good, but a bit rough but has ""From the Earth to the Starbucks"", which is this sub's and fans of Psych in general,  favorite epsiode. One of the greats and I feel that way as well.    Season 2 and 3- Probably the undisputed favorite seasons, it's almost all classics and the show was in top form and fresh and took chances. Again, understandably so. You got Black and Tan, American Duos, An Evening with Mr. Yang, ""Disco Didn't Die. It Was Murdered!"", Gus Walks into a Bank.    Season 5- A contender with 2 and 3 for best season, ""Dual Spires"",""Shawn 2.0"",""Yang 3 in 2D"".    Season 6 and 7- both very divisive seasons it seems, there seem to be the lovers and not so lovers. Very few people seem to have ambivalence about these seasons. Like for me personally I really really like 6 but I think 7 is the weakest season. Now seasons 6,7 are the some of the most recent episodes so maybe in a few years that'll all change.    Season 8- for the most part it seems like people are on board with this season, it still bothers the crap out of me that it was only 10 episodes, but whatever. They just really seemed to get their act together and made good episodes. Even rejuvenated it so much., were so good, you couldn't help but be like ""oh dang, do this and you could make another 5 seasons"".    But that leaves us with   Season 4- not many of the ""Classic"" episodes, but very few miss-fires with the exception of maybe ""Lets get hairy"" which a lot of people I have seen put it up there with one of the worst episodes of Psych, which is fair. Mostly because it's more boring than bad, which for Psych is bad because it was consistently one of the least boring shows on television. Still I feel like season 4 episodes and season 4 overall is the most underrated in the true sense of the word.  Thank you for reading obviously this is just my opinion, not saying I'm right."

psych,2zu3zu,PassionPitTime,5,Sat Mar 21 21:19:23 2015 UTC,The humor in white collar is very different but Neil and Peter do have an excellent buddy relationship. If you like the relationship dynamic between Shawn and Gus then you'll most likely like White Collar as well.
psych,2zu3zu,euphoneus,4,Sat Mar 21 22:26:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recommendation i will give it a try :D
psych,2zu3zu,grad14uc,2,Sat Mar 21 21:20:53 2015 UTC,"White Collar isn't currently doing a community rewatch at the moment on their sub. We are only on episode 5 of the first season. Not a bunch of people comment, but it might be worth checking out if you give it a shot."
psych,2zu3zu,grad14uc,2,Thu Mar 26 17:37:25 2015 UTC,Is*
psych,2zu3zu,Fearlessmojo,2,Sat Mar 28 15:35:28 2015 UTC,"Funny you say this I watch White Collar and THEN I watched Psych! They are both really nice shoes, if you like one chances are you might like the other"
psych,2zu3zu,Cohaagan,10,Sun Mar 22 06:53:06 2015 UTC,Burn Notice is what is recommend. It's what a friend recommended to me when he started watching Psych.  My favourite alternate theme was the Christmas one.  Favourite episode was probably a tie between the Clue homage and the Twin Peaks one.
psych,2zu3zu,501st_legion,8,Sat Mar 21 23:39:13 2015 UTC,"I have a few recommendations for similar shows:  Brooklyn Nine Nine- Andy Samberg, Terry Crews, Joe Lo Truglio, and Chelsea Perretti star in this one. A buddy cop show that is pretty hilarious.  The Good Guys- Another funny buddy cop show that was far too short lived with one season. Decently long season though, I absolutely loved this show. Stars Colin Hanks alongside the bad guy from Billy Madison. A rookie do-it-by-the-books cop gets paired up with a has-been who does things his own way. Highly recommend, was on Netflix in the US, not sure if it still is.  The Finder- It is a show about a man who has a special skill of finding people, and does so with his friends. Pretty funny but another short lived show at just one season. Not as good as the other two suggestions (and definitely no Psych) but still worth the watch. Still on Netflix last I checked.  White Collar was also mentioned, I watched a lot of it and it was ok, had a hard time staying interested. I may have binge watched too much in a short period of time, I think that's why I got a little burned out on it. Worth the watch though, you can always ditch it if you don't like the first few episodes. I liked it and will probably pick it up again soon.  Chuck is another one I would like to mention. Very funny, it is spy related instead of police related and the friendships in that one really draw you in too. In fact, maybe put this one at the top of the list, it is genuinely a great show IMO. Great soundtrack too and good acting for a lot of people you probably haven't seen much of. Plus the female lead is gorgeous, so, there's that too.  Hope that helped, but you can always rewatch Psych!  Edit: Redundancy is redundant and repetitive repetition."
psych,2zu3zu,501st_legion,7,Sun Mar 22 03:26:58 2015 UTC,I would recommend scrubs for shows that are like psych.  I loved the boys II men intro My favorite part of the show is definitely Shawn and Gus's interactions You didn't ask but my least favorite thing was the entire Bigfoot episode.
psych,2zu3zu,luckyshell,3,Sat Mar 21 20:52:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks i also love scrubs i actually own of all of them but that is a brilliant recommendation and tbh terk and jd use to be my fav black and white duo lol but now it has to go to shawn and gus.  i didn't mind that episode my least fav episode has to be the episode before the finale, where gus was having those zombie nightmares....i actually just found that episode confusing to follow and down right annoying at times.  but thanks for answering my q's."

psych,2zu3zu,rustedmachines,2,Mon Mar 30 23:48:48 2015 UTC,Chuck!
psych,2zu3zu,Kaibakura,2,Sun Mar 22 04:32:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly what I'd watch is like other people are saying  Twin Peaks (if only for dual spires references) though really you only need to watch the first season, but season 2 is ok and if you really like it they are doing more Twin Peaks coming soon.  Scrubs and Community-Definitely  Monk-I don't know I actually loved it when I was younger, but oddly enough I've never really felt like revisiting it after sharona left. Also it can be a bit stuffy for me like it's a watch with your grandmother show. Like Murder She Wrote or something.  Chuck-Honestly never really liked it  two slightly off suggestion that if you like this you might like  Dexter- its got a lot of the same environment sunny seaside crime drama, I mean yea its a lot heavier and more risque and gory, but I actually see a lot of similarities and they are both good shows. Humor was pretty varied (obvious/subtle/dark/light). Also a lot of flashbacks of the main actor as a kid learning his trade (again it'd be like if shawn was a borderline serial killer but still using powers for good like shawn does rather than bad)  X-Files- basically just really interesting procedural that had good series long archs. The humor is a lot darker stiffer (and certainly more sparse), but there is humor.  Like i said they are slightly off but i still think of fairly different seeming shows those two are good picks if you like psych and also like slightly heavier more intense stuff. Plus if you do like and watch them i think it allows you to return back to psych quickly and more easily. Because I hate when I watch something to much it becomes boring. I know I still like the show, it's just a bit tedious when I re-watch a series to close together.  also maybe Buffy the Vampire Slayer  what was your favorite part of the entire show?  Short of just saying, the show, i'd say character dynamic, without that the show would have just been your basic procedural. I literally thought Psych was going to be terrible (perish the thought) when I saw the first ads for back in (WHAT!) 2005-06. Then that next summer I believe after just the first 8 eps of season 1 were aired there was a marathon on like a tuesday and being that I had just graduated high school and quit my high school job, I decided ehh it's a lazy tuesday I'll give this likely terrible show a shot.  I fell in love  i really feel like it'd be near impossible to think of a more unique take on what is normally just a basic procedural. Especially in the hour long format.  what was your favorite alternative opening theme music?  all of them, I like some more than others, but it's always a nice treat when they do. They changed it up just enough to be interesting, like maybe twice a season. Actually just a quick personal side-note about theme music, I normally hate theme music for shows. If I'm watching Modern Family/Scrubs/Friends/etc, I usually try to skip the 15-45 seconds of theme, I don't know. It's always been a pet peeve of mine. Especially since if I like the show I've seen it a lot so why would I want to hear it another million times, but Psych is really one of the few shows where if the remote or whatever is a bit out of reach, I'm cool with it. I don't even particularly love the theme, it's certainly not bad, but I think it's Pavlovian to me now. When I first started watching Psych I would always be relaxed. Have nice snack and drink and for 42 minutes not care. So now when I hear that beginning 4 seconds of riff and that background ""Whoo"" just before ""I know you know!"" and the zoom in close up of Shawn's face, and in later season of Gus doing his over excited run up a few steps and fall, I instantly feel relaxed."
psych,2zu3zu,GrammarWizard,2,Tue Mar 31 17:50:48 2015 UTC,"I recommend:   Terriers (only one season was produced and it's available on US Netflix). It stars Donal Logue as a former cop/private detective ( I forget the exact situation) but it's a bit more serious than Psych. It's pretty outrageous and can be quite funny. iZombie on CW. I haven't seen it yet but it's based on a Vertigo comic of the same name. It centers on Liv, a mortician who is a zombie. She gains memories of the dead by eating their brains. From the reactions I've seen on /r/DCcomics and /r/DCTelevision it's really good and there's even an off-hand reference to Psych in the first episode. Brooklyn Nine Nine on Fox. It stars Andy Samberg and Terry Crews as detectives in... Brooklyn. The episodes aren't centered on cases or crime, however, but on characters. Production is super slick and acting is great.   My favorite alternative opening theme music either has to be the Bollywood version.  Edit: formatting."

psych,2zrci8,Rooibosisboss,2,Sat Mar 21 17:48:12 2015 UTC,"The guy doing the show said that he's trying to keep it from being just a ""murder mystery of the day"" type of show. I'm guessing it has to do with that: yeah, she solves unsolved murders, but that's that's incidental, not the point of the episode. Think of it more like Pushing Daisies than CSI."
psych,2zrci8,Qwerty27_27,3,Sun Mar 22 00:35:51 2015 UTC,"There was mystery solving, but it was in a ""following breadcrumbs"" sort of way.  She sees, hears, or smells something the victim did, and gets a vision based on that. She then has to follow up on that lead, and try to lead police into the right questions (like Conan Edogawa) until she comes up with something that gives her another vision, and another lead.  A major difference between this and Psych is that she actually is psychic (she is seeing visions of the victims memory), but is hiding why she is psychic."

So if USA said to go 42 minutes for a standard show and through editing Steve decides it's 41:08 then he'll just plug in a longer intro to hit the 42 minute mark.  Not that I think the show suffers for it, but usually shows have a set intro that is consistent in duration and the actual show is edited around it to meet the time constraint."

psych,2zaxbq,DnXCrypto,5,Tue Mar 17 01:42:42 2015 UTC,"well he keeps up the psychic thing because being really observant isn't really evidence, throughout the series you'll hear ""find us something concrete"" because they can't just on what he says"
psych,2zaxbq,Herculesmngmnt,2,Tue Mar 17 02:55:59 2015 UTC,well being a psychic imo apears even more useless as evidence
psych,2zaxbq,DefenestratedCow,9,Tue Mar 17 04:06:01 2015 UTC,"Usually he uses it to either find more definitive evidence or induce a confession.  It's really more for comedic effect, though.  From what I've heard, The Mentalist is more of a drama.  I'd definitely classify Psych as a comedy, even though the shows have similar premises.  Psych does have dramatic moments, they're just not the focus.  (except the season finales can get pretty intense.)"
psych,2zaxbq,Soloos,5,Wed Mar 18 01:08:39 2015 UTC,"You'll notice that he often circumvents the rules in order to obtain evidence. If he admitted it, he wouldn't be allowed to do it again. This way he just pretends he got a vision, and thus has no repercussions."
psych,2zaxbq,wibo58,5,Fri Mar 20 22:47:00 2015 UTC,"He does the psychic thing because in the first episode he uses it as an excuse as to why he knows so much about the crimes. Chief Vick and the police thought he was involved because he knew so much. Vick says if they find out he's lying he'll be arrested, so he just rolls with it."

This time, compulsive liar Ryan, who is notorious for calling in tips and sending the department on wild goose chases, is telling the truth about the assassination plot he overheard in the restaurant.  quotes    Lyin' Ryan: The night before, I went to this restaurant to get a basket of these things called Fries Quatro Queso Dos Fritos. You know, the ones where they inject potatoes with a four-cheese mixture, fry them trhee-quarters of the way, pull them out, batter them, fry them again, and then serve them with bacon and an ancho chile sour cream? Anyway, as I was sitting there, a car speeds right through the storefront across the street. It makes such a loud noise, I had to turn my head and look, and that is when I overheard the guy with the curlicues on his face tell the other guy at the corner table about the assassination plot.  Shawn Spencer: [in the observation room] Can it be true?  Burton 'Gus' Guster: No way.  Shawn Spencer: I mean, is it even possible?  Burton 'Gus' Guster: I couldn't imagine it.  Shawn Spencer: There's no way you can prepare a fry like that.   That'd be way too much for the human palate to manage.  Burton 'Gus' Guster: It would be a flavor seizure.    Shawn Spencer: I will slap you in the face.    Juliet O'Hara: Are you all right?  Shawn Spencer: Yeah. Of course I am. Why?  Juliet O'Hara: Well, we got the message that you were at the hospital. Something about life and death?  Shawn Spencer: Oh, right. That. Well, we are in a hospital and as it happens it's filled with both life and death.  Burton 'Gus' Guster: I knew I should have left that message.    Shawn: No no no. Mayor McCheese, he had the 'stache. Burglar had the mask.  Gus: Right, right. Then it was Grimace. That brother was funny.  Shawn: No no no. Excuse us. I gave you Vin Diesel.   Gus: Gave me?   Shawn: You're not claiming Grimace as a brother.  Gus: Grimace is a brother.   Shawn: He's an amorphous mass. He's like an amoeba.  Gus: He's a black amoeba, Shawn.  Shawn: Purple.    Shawn Spencer: How can you tell that someone's a compulsive liar? I mean, assuming that their pants aren't on fire.    one of my personal favorite and underrated lines  Shawn: How much do we have in the Psych savings account?  Gus: I really hate when you ask that question.  POP CULT references.

psych,2xwl4r,ATXPibble,4,Thu Mar 5 19:41:52 2015 UTC,I think the scene where Lassiter is watching Shawn's video and shuts it off right before he says he isn't a psychic is more emotional than Shawn's goodbye to Gus.  Just my opinion though
psych,2xwl4r,Shaddow1,2,Fri Mar 6 21:50:10 2015 UTC,I agree. The way they molded lassies character over the series was damn near perfecf
psych,2xwl4r,AreYouReadyToReddit,3,Thu Mar 12 20:59:54 2015 UTC,"What made me laugh the hardest:  Shawn trying to steal Gus's corn on the cob and Gus shutting him down every time.  As someone who grew up with a few brothers this scene felt like my childhood, and really demonstrated how they were as much family as childhood friends."
psych,2xwl4r,Ric_Adbur,3,Thu Mar 5 20:30:58 2015 UTC,"I think this show more than any other will always remain my favorite.  Their sense of humor perfectly meshes with mine, the characters are all brilliant and unique and the dynamic between all of them is just perfect, and the writing is consistently top notch.  They captured a perfect cross-section of pop culture for people who grew up in the 80's and 90's.  It almost feels like a love letter to a time gone by.  Rarely do I miss a show once it's gone like I miss this show."
psych,2xwl4r,Spanishsoul,3,Fri Mar 6 21:36:51 2015 UTC,Check out Brooklyn 99.  It's not as good as psych but it's still good!
psych,2xwl4r,DanFromSales2,3,Thu Mar 5 03:47:41 2015 UTC,I will never be hooked to any other show as much as I was hooked to Psych. I am currently going through my 4th re-watch of the entire show.  I thought the funniest part of the entire show was at the end of Cog Blocked in season 8 where Gus struts into his office.
psych,2xwl4r,WhatHappenedToLeeds,2,Sun Mar 8 02:46:16 2015 UTC,"I just finished the show this morning. I've been watching it on Netflix for about 3 weeks now. I currently work from home so I'm able to have the TV while I'm working. I honestly did not think I would love this show as much as I do now. I was only with them for 3 weeks and I'm going to miss it so much, I can only imagine how much more someone who started watching the show when it came out feels about it."

psych,2xwl4r,EmCClapyohands,1 point,Sun Mar 8 23:31:17 2015 UTC,"I finished the show months after it was actually over too, and I somehow didn't ruin the ending for myself (probably because I didn't know this subreddit existed until today.  But this show was so great, and so sad that it's over, but it ran it's course and ended appropriately. And if you couldn't guess, my favorite moment from the show is from Season 5, Episode 5, where Shawn introduces Gus as MC Clap Yo Handz, and Gus goes right along with it. The comedic timing and the chemistry of the cast throughout the show is what makes it o great. And Brooklyn 99 is a great suggestion for something close to the greatness of Psych."

psych,2xb2b3,Rooibosisboss,2,Fri Feb 27 23:59:43 2015 UTC,"well they are both actors who were pretty big in the late 80's to mid 90's which is an era for a lot of references and jokes in Psych, because they (Shawn and Gus) were teenagers during this time.  Both actors have become big enough names, but have also pretty much taken to pretty bad direct to dvd type movies so the career slide makes them a slightly easier target. However they both have great humility to take it in stride as evidenced by their willingness to participate in an actual episode.  Even more likely Shawn and Gus are fairly oddball in their tastes and Kilmer/Zane have done some pretty ""interesting"" movies for better or worse."

psych,2x72fp,joecarst,2,Sat Feb 28 06:18:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly what I'd watch is like other people are saying  Twin Peaks (if only for dual spires references) though really you only need to watch the first season, but season 2 is ok and if you really like it they are doing more Twin Peaks coming soon.  Scrubs and Community-Definitely  Monk-I don't know I actually loved it when I was younger, but oddly enough I've never really felt like revisiting it after sharona left. Also it can be a bit stuffy for me like it's a watch with your grandmother show. Like Murder She Wrote or something.  Chuck-Honestly never really liked it  two slightly off suggestion that if you like this you might like  Dexter- its got a lot of the same environment sunny seaside crime drama, I mean yea its a lot heavier and more risque and gory, but I actually see a lot of similarities and they are both good shows. Humor was pretty varied (obvious/subtle/dark/light). Also a lot of flashbacks of the main actor as a kid learning his trade (again it'd be like if shawn was a borderline serial killer but still using powers for good like shawn does rather than bad)  X-Files- basically just really interesting procedural that had good series long archs. The humor is a lot darker stiffer (and certainly more sparse), but there is humor.  Like i said they are slightly off but i still think of fairly different seeming shows those two are good picks if you like psych and also like slightly heavier more intense stuff. Plus if you do like and watch them i think it allows you to return back to psych quickly and more easily. Because I hate when I watch something to much it becomes boring. I know I still like the show, it's just a bit tedious when I re-watch a series to close together.  edit: also maybe Buffy the Vampire Slayer"

For such a diminutive character as the season finale when the show was still getting it's bearings she acted the hell out of her part.   The fact that she was cute as a goddamn button especially when sharing the screen with smokin' first season Maggie didn't hurt at all either.   She did get a nod in the first episode of season 3 though. I think Shawn said he asked her for help with some lights when he was haunting gus' boss.

psych,2wy9f0,ImpalaPooge,3,Tue Feb 24 17:08:22 2015 UTC,Easily Mary! Woody and McNab are great too!
psych,2wy9f0,janinefour,3,Tue Feb 24 23:14:19 2015 UTC,"There were so many great guests....but I think Ken was my favorite, wished we saw him more.  Or maybe Lawyer Gus..."
psych,2wy9f0,MadnessDreamer,5,Wed Feb 25 03:32:24 2015 UTC,"Love all of what everyone else has said! I'd like to add Dwayne (the one that does computer generated sketches), and Father Wesley."
psych,2wy9f0,akfourty7,2,Tue Feb 24 07:10:27 2015 UTC,Was Dwayne only in the LEEEROY JENKINS!! Episode?
psych,2wy9f0,DealWithItBish,1 point,Tue Feb 24 16:06:49 2015 UTC,yes.
psych,2wy9f0,between2,2,Tue Feb 24 21:45:07 2015 UTC,"McNab, Woody, and Dobson even though we only see him once."
psych,2wy9f0,Joethemofoe,2,Tue Feb 24 07:30:27 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, this received way more attention than I thought it would. Now it makes me wish more characters were able to make a cameo in the final season."
psych,2wuc6d,JonSnuhhh,20,Mon Feb 23 05:21:36 2015 UTC,"Essentially after Shawn admitting to Jules he was faking, they slowly drifted back together over a number of episodes.  In E08 they broke up.  In E09 Shawn moves out, the plot revolves around Juliet's new roommate and at the end of the episode Jules hints at there being a chance they could get back together. (Super ep imho.)  In E10 Shawn pesters Juliet into being his date at a party while he's running for mayor. They dance, Jules gets emotional. Then Shawn attempts to admit he's not psychic to Chief Vick, only for Juliet to stop him at the last minute.  E11 start with them in bed together and that's really where the story arc ends."
psych,2wuc6d,thebunsen,5,Mon Feb 23 06:33:21 2015 UTC,"Probably the best summation.   People seem to ask this question a lot which is understandable and this is the best way to answer it but I think people also need to understand partly why it was like that, was because of what was happening outside of the show.  Season 6-8 was a weird time for the writers and actors, like everyone simultaneously really wanted things to keep going and end things. The network who for the most part treated psych well were constantly unsure as to whether or not renew it. They had a solid fan base, it wasn't huge, but it drew in good numbers on days and times not many people watch tv and the fans are dedicated so not to much of a worry about a major drop.  But with Maggie Lawson leaving and then returning and the mixed feelings all round shows in the writing and style of specifically that last two seasons. Even though re-watching I enjoy 7, you can see all the stuff i listed earlier so clearly and it's to me the reason why it's the weakest season, though still some great stuff. Season 8 was a bit rocky but when they found their footing it was really really good, like rejuvenated the show good, unfortunately it was the end.   Sorry went off on a tangent there but i thought it's something to think about."
psych,2wuc6d,Rooibosisboss,10,Sat Feb 28 21:03:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I gotta say this is one of the major points of the show that disappointed me. It felt like they never delved into their relationship and it was rather something the writers did to fit the typical tv comedy mold."
psych,2wuc6d,alphabased,3,Mon Feb 23 15:26:47 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%. I wish shawn continued to date random chicks from different cases, then SandH finally eloped in the second to last episode. The finale could have been set 6 months from the second to last and shawn proposes to her there."
psych,2wuc6d,AndrewistheHCIC,11,Tue Feb 24 01:47:53 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that when a show stops focusing on a relationship you know it's going to last this time. It happened in Scrubs with JD and Elliot, and it happened here with Shawn and Juliet."
psych,2wuc6d,Kaibakura,5,Mon Feb 23 15:51:57 2015 UTC,"BTW was anyone else somewhat disappointed in the reveal -- I really wanted Shawn to indignantly say ""I TRIED to tell you how I work and you said you could never understand what I do!""    Then after they broke up, I really wanted Gus to make the two of them sit down together and tell Shawn to close his eyes and tell them about the hats in the room (or whatever) -- you know Gus must have seen Henry do that to Shawn hundreds of times -- and then explain that this is what happens when you do that to a kid because you're a crazy obsessed cop-dad."
psych,2wuc6d,Oknight,3,Mon Feb 23 23:28:26 2015 UTC,"Well, jules is barely in the final season, but all of your questions will be answered, just keep watching"
psych,2wuc6d,UncommonSense0,1 point,Mon Feb 23 06:52:14 2015 UTC,"I thought the final end of her pique was the episode where Shawn and Gus were running her through the insanity of their investigation and she stopped them and said... ""you know what, never mind -- I don't WANT to understand your process."""
psych,2wuc6d,Oknight,2,Mon Feb 23 23:22:21 2015 UTC,Your almost there. I don't want to spoil it for you. Let's just say it has a very Psych wrap up.
psych,2wuc6d,csicc,7,Mon Feb 23 06:31:11 2015 UTC,You know that's right!
