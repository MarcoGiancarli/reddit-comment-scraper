catpranks,3d74qv,thumtak,4,Tue Jul 14 03:21:37 2015 UTC,Out of curiosity how can you tell what she is? We adopted her and have no idea or where we would start looking to figure out.
catpranks,3d74qv,madduck6,2,Tue Jul 14 03:32:43 2015 UTC,"Someone else identified her here. I picked her up as a stray, so I have no way to track her lineage, and I know she's not purebred (not that I care,) but I've done a fair amount of reading on the breed after someone pointed it out. Her coat is a little too short-haired, but everything else matches. (The odd-eyes and the markings/coat texture are pretty good giveaways.)"
catpranks,3d74qv,madduck6,3,Tue Jul 14 15:13:59 2015 UTC,Dont turkish vans usually have a fluffier tail and orange markings?
catpranks,3d74qv,Sohcahtoa82,3,Tue Jul 14 12:27:17 2015 UTC,"Orange head/tail markings are the most common, but any color can be a Turkish Van. I've seen grey pretty frequently.  Though mine's not purebred, I'm sure. I found her as a stray and her coat never floofs out fully. (But it is a little oily/water resistant, like a Labrador.)"
catpranks,3d74qv,Sohcahtoa82,3,Tue Jul 14 15:12:21 2015 UTC,Oooh okay cool! I didnt know that. thanks.   Also does your tukish van love water as well? I hear thats a really common trait with them and is a big reason why I've always wanted to adopt one :x
catpranks,3d74qv,Maken_n00bz_Cry,3,Tue Jul 14 22:50:35 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. She loves being near water. She looms outside my shower every morning, and sometimes will put her paws on the edge and poke her head into the curtain or wave a paw at the stream. She also paces the bathtub ledge if I run a bath, and gets super talkative. She likes watching the toilet water when it flushes and will randomly hang out in the shower while it's off.   But she hates getting wet. She doesn't want to be IN the bath or IN the shower. She just wants to talk about it and watch it. I think if I'd introduced her to baths when she was a kitten she wouldn't be so conflicted over it."
catpranks,3d74qv,RenaKunisaki,3,Tue Jul 14 23:01:42 2015 UTC,"My cat has insane eyes  Before anyone freaks out, the eye is hella dilated because of some eye drops the vet gave us.

Its especially vital for games that are highly dependent on timing such as fighting games like Super Smash Brothers.  As a matter of fact if you walk into a Super Smash Bros tournament, you'll usually find the grand finals contestants sitting on stage, huddled together staring at a ""24 CRT television. If you're lucky they've rigged up an auxiliary display to a projector so spectators can see what's happening."

I swear that crow was really smart because he seemed to know exactly how to push her buttons without getting eaten and seemed to enjoy doing it. To this day it puzzles me. I can see no natural selection-type advantage to trolling a cat with your life (unless maybe female crows are impressed by the skill and it is a mating behavior?) so I assumed the crow was just very ""intelligent"" since the only other animals I have seen engaging in risky behaviors that have no easily discernable upside for successful completion (other than not dying, which you would have done if you avoided the behavior) are humans (ex: skydiving, not wearing helmet on motorcycle, not wearing seatbelt, etc etc.)"

Years ago we had a couple of Orange tabbys  - one was around 10-12 lbs and the other was like half that weight.  The smaller one was intimidated a lot by the larger one.  If it were on the bed he'd chase her off.   She had a habit though, which was quite unusual for a cat -- she'd curl up in a ball under the covers and purr away, completely safe (or so she thought) from the bigger tabby.  One day I'm reading beside my wife in bed, the purring is going on next to my wife.   Up jumps the bigger tabby.   He slowly makes his way toward the purring.   With similar weight and calculation, he determines exactly where that purring is coming from under the covers.  We didn't see it coming until it was too late -- suddenly he's smacking that cats head from above the covers like a crazed golfer digging out of a sand trap.    The smaller tabby shoots out from under the blankets like a fat person spitting out a stuck throat lozenge.     Although we felt really sorry for the smaller cat, it was hard not to laugh.   Cats are such the surprise attack artists."

The cat struck at the woman, she raised her arm in defense. She didn't punch the cat. She didn't injure the cat.   The movement she made with her arm was purely instinctual.

I taught my cat how to open doors from either side which is not only useful for him, but saves me getting up. It really jut took 4 days of picking up his arms to push against the door to open it and after that he figured the rest out (like if he's from the other side, pulling the door towards him helps or to push the handle). I didn't need any treats or anything involved, he just figured out he could do it himself.  He also randomly learnt to go out when my mum says ""Out!"". We have no idea how he learnt it but we tried it out of desperation and he actually went outside..."

The best answer I can give you so far is: Don't worry, nobody is quite sure!  Currently, the most popular theory is that the ""Dominant White"" allele disrupts the distribution of melanocytes, which is what results in the lack of pigment in the hair. This includes the hairs in the organ of Corti, which is the receptor organ in the cochlea.   These hairs are extremely vital to processing auditory signals, and just as extremely sensitive to damage. Loss of pigment is enough to mess with their function (from here we'd have to start talking about ions...) .  .  .  TL;DR  - White gene fucks up the little hairs in the cochlea and has a high chance of making the cat deaf. .  .  Edit: I should point out, eye colour is an important factor too. The Dominant White cats with blue eyes have a higher incidence of deafness.   .  (Lin, J. and Fisher, D. (2007). Melanocyte biology and skin pigmentation. Nature, 445(7130), pp.843-850.)"

You would usually add the 32, but since the Celsius temperature is in the negatives, you subtract it.

There is no logic to ""normally you would add but since it's negative you subtract"". The obvious answer here is that C = -30, therefore   1.8 * -30 + 32 =  -54 + 32 = -22 F  edit: And the reason -40 is -40 in both systems is because 1 degree C is equal to 1.8 degrees F, and they're offset by 32, as you can see from the conversion formula. At -40C, before the offset, F would be 32 degrees lower. But since they are offset, i.e. 0C = 32F, that means -40C = -40F"

catpranks,2u5wxs,Chessolin,17,Fri Jan 30 14:21:19 2015 UTC,One of our cats eats tape.  Loves the stuff! We have to make sure every box we get has all the tape ripped off or we will definitely be woken up to the sound of a cat munching on tape.
catpranks,2u5wxs,YourCupOTea,18,Fri Jan 30 16:42:08 2015 UTC,"I had a cat that loved the smell of bleach. I had dropped a bag of chicken (the frozen stuff, only now it was thawed out) and it went everywhere. Him and his brother were asleep in the living room, so Icleaned up and pulled out the bleach and got to work.20 minutes after I washed the whole floor he comes Blinky. He's acting like a cat in heat, but you know he's a male. He was making a ton of noise, rolling around and whatnot. So I gave him attention, a belly scratch, shoulder blade scratch, just scratching him everywhere. Then he wonders over to thebucket of bleach I didn't dump out yet, and it increases ten fold. So I dump it out, rinse the spot of grass I dumped it on and feed him and his brother (his brother is/was Buster, named after the A.D. character). THree weeks later, I use bleach in the bathroom and here comes Blinky again. Tripping balls and getting high I guess.  Possibly RIP Blinky & Buster <33 miss you two kitties. best cats 2014. Family thinksBlinky was eaten/killed by a Racoon, Buster went missing a month after. I think my neighbors did something to them though."

Cats are incredibly lithe creatures and will try to avoid rubbing against terrain unless they are actively trying to scent-mark the area. This avoidance isn't pain or fear, just confusion. If the cat was scared of the object, it would be panicking (see any video of someone tying a balloon to a cat's foot). And if it was in pain, there would be flat ears, hissing, and claws."

catpranks,2u0k4v,TheBananaPuncher,7,Thu Jan 29 12:26:46 2015 UTC,"If you do this repeatedly, the cat will begin to enjoy the exercise because it's physically and mentally involved.

catpranks,2u0k4v,dizao,15,Thu Jan 29 14:26:25 2015 UTC,uh.. What?  Nutrition in cats is just like in humans.  Calories In - Calories Out = Weight Loss / Weight Gain.  If your cat is overweight but not getting any heavier and you continue to give it the same amount of food.  Forcing it to work out this way will make it lose weight.
catpranks,2u0k4v,jsmooth7,15,Thu Jan 29 01:19:26 2015 UTC,"I think the cat isn't getting any extra food, the food he normally gets is now being used as motivation to exercise."
catpranks,2u0k4v,TheBananaPuncher,4,Thu Jan 29 01:22:10 2015 UTC,"Does the act of working out nullify the calorie burn of the workout itself? Because that's physically impossible. If the cat burns 100 calories and eats 50 calories during the light workout, then the cat loses 50 calories and therefor weight in the long term. If the cat eats 100 calories and loses 100 calories then it stays the same weight and it would be wise to reduce portions or increase exercise."
catpranks,2u0k4v,YRYGAV,3,Thu Jan 29 02:05:58 2015 UTC,"You need to feed your cat regardless.  If you decided to eat a snickers, you're better off walking around the house while eating it than sitting in a chair while eating it."
catpranks,2u0k4v,TheBananaPuncher,2,Thu Jan 29 02:51:22 2015 UTC,"It's not, to successfully burn calories all one has to do is have the basic willpower to resist a stationary lifestyle and the temptation to gorge oneself with over sized portions or a snack every minute. You burn on average 1500-2000 calories per day by simply existing due to basic human processes and functions. I can eat a Snicker's and eat a smaller portion during my lunch or dinner and be fine, or I can sacrifice about 15-30 minutes and do some light exercises to burn it off and result in increased muscle growth."
catpranks,2u0k4v,TheBananaPuncher,6,Thu Jan 29 01:26:01 2015 UTC,"If every meal was presented in such a fashion, then the cat will undoubetdly eat less and exercise more. For every bite that cat takes it has walked about 15-30 seconds. To finish that plate with those small nibbles will have it staying on the treadmill for several minutes, probably 7-8+ minutes. This will reduce the cat's weight with zero doubt in my mind, because if an outdoor cat can eat a bowl full of food, run around for 30minutes to an hour being a dick to other cats and nap the rest of the day with zero weight gain, then I'm sure it will happen to this cat too. I know this because I have seen this in action several times. Every stray cat that uses our family's garage as a napping spot is given bowls of food and water, they eat it and they look completely thin and healthy."

The dog was out to eat that cat and the only one that refused to believe it was my sister. It’s killed 2 of her chickens and she still says it wouldn’t hurt the cat. The cat knew better and after living under a bed for a month it gave up waiting for the dog to leave and moved next door to my house and has been here for the last 2 years.

Green lasers can cause corneal damage, most notably, seconds after being shined directly into any mammalian eye. Not sure how dangerous just the reflection off of a surface is however"
catpranks,2nrzi9,Dtomnom,11,Sun Nov 30 04:12:04 2014 UTC,"While it's true that green light is more energetic and damaging, the higher danger of green laser pointers is actually due to a combination of two different factors: the fact that the average green pointer has a power output of 5mW compared to 1mW for a red pointer, and that green laser is produced by pushing infrared laser through a frequency multiplier. In a cheap pointer, the multiplier will usually leak and let through a large amount of IR.  In effect, a red laser pointer puts out 1mW of visible light, while a green laser pointer puts out 5mW of light plus possibly many times more miliwatts of IR, which is invisible but still perfectly capable of causing eye damage."

catpranks,2nnpsn,eats_shit_and_dies,6,Sat Nov 29 06:29:44 2014 UTC,Same here. I thought it was a metal food bowl and the cat was being cautious because of the chickens. Oh well it probably would have been even more dangerous not to scare it. The cat would have slowly crept up on the snake like a retard. I guess the best thing would be to prevent the situation altogether.

And there may not be enough room in the bin for the cat to flip around like they normally would so it might land on its head.  That being said the cat is probably fine.

catpranks,2fgafl,RobotApocalypse,4,Fri Sep 5 01:51:48 2014 UTC,"Meme:       A meme (/ˈmiːm/ meem)  is ""an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture.""  A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.   The word meme is a shortening (modeled on gene) of mimeme (from Ancient Greek μίμημα Greek pronunciation: [míːmɛːma] mīmēma, ""imitated thing"", from μιμεῖσθαι mimeisthai, ""to imitate"", from μῖμος mimos ""mime"")  and it was coined by the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene (1976)   as a concept for discussion of evolutionary principles in explaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. Examples of memes given in the book included melodies, catch-phrases, fashion, and the technology of building arches.   Proponents theorize that memes may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, each of which influence a meme's reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread, and (for better or for worse) mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.

catpranks,2fgafl,BevansDesign,1 point,Thu Sep 4 23:03:33 2014 UTC,Do you watch him when you let him out? Just got my first cat; she doesn't seem to like outside.
catpranks,2fgafl,Hybernative,9,Thu Sep 4 23:54:22 2014 UTC,"Somewhat. We watched him quite a bit when we first started letting him out, but now we just check on him from time to time, to make sure he hasn't wrapped the leash around a bush or something. Even when he does, we usually just have to say ""go around"" and he'll walk around the bush to unwrap himself, or ""other way"" if he starts going the wrong way. (Smart kitty!)   He doesn't stay out for more than an hour at a time usually, but he'll go out multiple times each day (between naps) .   Your cat probably just has to get used to being outside and having a harness on (if that's what you're doing). Maybe take her out for 10 minutes at a time at first, and toss around some toys. If your yard is really open, she might not like being so exposed, so it helps to have something she can hide behind nearby.   If you get a harness, be sure it's made for cats. It should have the metal loop just behind the shoulder blades on the strap that goes around the torso, not on the strap that goes around the neck.  One nice side-effect is that my cat seems to prefer peeing outside, so we don't have to empty the litter box as often."

However, your vet is right that unless trained you should avoid scruffing.  I think the issue is that most people think that you can actually lift the cat by scruffing (like a mama with her kittens). This can cause nerve damage and/or tear skin by suspending their weight from the scruff."

catpranks,286hxq,osirus2010,9,Sun Nov 2 18:20:11 2014 UTC,"No, sorry, I don't have a source.  I work at a vet clinic, though, and we use light to moderate scruffing very often to work with cats, usually in conjunction with holding another part of the body/supporting their weight.  Most don't seem to mind at all.  I assume it's neutral because it's used when they're kittens by their mother for transport, not for punishment.  Adult cats also tend to have looser, thicker skin around their necks, and because of this scruffing generally doesn't choke or hurt them.  Of course, there are always exceptions, and some cats may naturally dislike it!  That said, it's not a great idea to put the cat's entire weight on the scruff, as that could damage their skin.  If you scruff them while carrying them, support their weight with your other hand if possible."

catpranks,22aqqc,KennyFulgencio,27,Sun Apr 6 21:06:31 2014 UTC,"Nice.  And so that i'm not making a one word comment...   On the short term, cats and actually many animals CAN kind of detect earthquakes before we can. I'm not sure about the 'why', but sometimes they will detect the p-waves. These are compression waves that we rarely notice unless they are exceptionally strong indeed.  What we notice and produces the first really visible movement is the s-waves that follow, which are seismic waves with shearing forces (transverse wave). The other types of seismic waves that follow the S-waves are usually extremely noticeable as well."
catpranks,22aqqc,The_Wilky,18,Sat Apr 5 22:19:24 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, I have to disagree.  I know this is old, but it is never too old to drop a knowledge bomb.  Cats and other animals don't sense or feel earthquakes happening before we do, that actually hear it.  The range of human hearing is 20 hertz to 20,000 hertz (20 hz being low pitch, 20,000hz being high pitch), it tends to decay with age, but animals can hear at a much wider range.  Earthquakes emit very, VERY loud, low pitch noises. These noises are lower than 20hz, so we can't hear it. It's so loud, it makes animals appear to be crazy, for no reason. Like when a stereo has been used at loud volumes, and you unexpectedly turn it on to the loudest, most shocking music.  Reference: I am a sound designer for major motion pictures. I've studied sound for several years."
catpranks,22aqqc,wrathofkitten,1 point,Sun Apr 27 17:11:21 2014 UTC,do sound designers ever use very low frequency sounds for an eerie effect to unsettle the audience?
catpranks,22aqqc,Vehudur,3,Wed Jul 16 18:54:35 2014 UTC,"Absolutely they do. You can experience it a lot in Sci-Fi, especially with spaceships going by. Because you can't hear anything in space, we use LF sound to rumble the audience. Another example is a character in a dark basement, we use LF so simulate the machinery or use the vibration to relax the audience by slowing their heart rate, just before the killer jumps out and stabs everyone."

catpranks,22aqqc,c_ts,0,Thu May 15 04:49:12 2014 UTC,Part of the reason is simply that they spend more time in contact with the ground. We would likely notice them earlier if we were laying on the floor

catpranks,22aqqc,FaggotMcSandNigger,15,Sat Apr 5 23:46:09 2014 UTC,I imagine it's because everything was suddenly shaking (and he only felt the p-waves before)
catpranks,22aqqc,DrewTuber,11,Sun Apr 6 00:05:49 2014 UTC,"Because if the source of the earthquake is more than a few dozen miles away (its hypocenter), there is a time gap between the P and S waves because the P waves travel much faster.  So the cat may feel the P waves, scaring it into an initial reaction, and then the S waves will REALLY scare the shit out of it."

There's a bit of interesting science behind the Cat Righting Reflex , this was an attempt to study it.   At first glance, this reflex violates the law of Angular momentum, the cat was applying torque to their rotation, but were able to stop facing down without interacting with other objects. Imagine floating in space and being able to turn exactly 90 degrees and stop - without touching anything or using any propulsion; this would violate physics and worthy of being studied.   The conclusion of this is that cats are able to do this because their body is not treated as a single cylinder of rotating motion - but instead they bend their spine to create two cylinders rotating inwards. This starts to get real sciencey when it's described by nonholonomic systems.  TL;DR : Cats were able to defy physics, we wanted to know why."

catpranks,1zd2fa,007T,-5,Sun Mar 2 18:48:46 2014 UTC,"Same with all laser pointers, even a 5mW pointer can cause damage.   And as for IR filters... In laser light all the light particles are in sync and are the same wavelength, so unless it's an IR laser, it wouldn't produce any IR radiation."
catpranks,1zd2fa,007T,37,Sun Mar 2 19:05:06 2014 UTC,"Same with all laser pointers, even a 5mW pointer can cause damage.   Not quite, a 5mW red laser pointer will generally always be 5mW or less. Green pointers are almost always over spec because they're made with readily available 300 or 500mW pump diodes with around 5-10% efficiency, that can result in powers as high as 50mW without counting the IR. 5mW of laser light pointed right into your eye (don't try this) wont immediately do any damage, that's what the FDA standards outline.    And as for IR filters... In laser light all the light particles are in sync and are the same wavelength, so unless it's an IR laser, it wouldn't produce any IR radiation.   This is also incorrect, and you shouldn't be posting information about lasers if you don't know what you're talking about. These green laser pointers are driven by IR pump diodes, the majority of the IR light is lost as heat in the crystal set, the remainder either leaks through or gets converted to green light - unless you filter it out. Cheap pointers don't include an IR filter and the IR that leaks through is invisible and can be extremely harmful."
catpranks,1zd2fa,007T,12,Sun Mar 2 19:08:53 2014 UTC,"You're right, I was assuming ideal laser light, but green laser diodes have several wavelength transitions which aren't always optimal.  E: I guess my main message was that be careful with lasers."
catpranks,1zd2fa,HRBLT,28,Sun Mar 2 19:14:01 2014 UTC,"but green laser diodes have several wavelength transitions which aren't always optimal.   That's because your laser pointer does not use a green laser diode.  It uses an infrared laser diode and converts it to green light with a series of inefficient crystals. It's emitting 808nm infrared (the original wavelength of the diode), 1064nm infrared (the frequency after it passes through the first crystal) and 532nm green light (the frequency doubled wavelength after it passes through the second crystal)."

catpranks,1zd2fa,Calamitosity,1 point,Sat Mar 8 02:37:19 2014 UTC,"It depends on the strength of the laser and the surface you're hitting, usually reflections from imperfect mirrors like shiny objects or metal bits spread the light out enough that it becomes far less concentrated. A sufficiently powerful laser pointer can damage your eyes just by looking at the dot on a white wall 10 feet away without safety glasses. If you're bouncing the laser off something more precise like a pane of glass or a mirror, then you're taking a much more concentrated hit - possibly close to the full strength of the laser."

Cats are paranoid and very fast learners, so if the cat door doesn't work once, they may start to avoid it entirely.

The prank might not be worth the risk of training the cats to distrust the door. With that said, it was also pretty hilarious. 10/10."

There have been times when he was on punishment and my husband would come home and he would accidentally scare the cat (loud combat boots). He would run into the door then whine about it.

I'm sure as hell you wouldn't be happy about it. to insult a genre is no different to insulting the fans of that genre. after all they listen to garbage, there can't be anything good about them.  It doesn't sound like much to you, but that's because you're not listening. Metal might not be your favourite genre in the world, but at least try and appreciate it. I don't particularly enjoy listening to rap music, but I can appreciate the talent that artists like Eminem and Tupac have or had, and I can listen to the music and understand why it's become a genre, and why people listen to it. your failure or downright refusal to do that shows that you don't truly understand music, or what music is about, and you do try to appreciate all genres, then in my opinion, you will never learn to understand and appreciate music as an art form."

And so, for that matter, have I. Hi! I'm a classically-trained professional musician and composer, a student of musicology, and also a long-time fan of metal (as are many of my peers and professors, I'll note). These sorts of criticisms are constantly leveled not only against metal, but against almost every form of music that has ever existed, and they're always completely baseless, amounting to nothing more than hegemony and cultural elitism.   However, if you'd like to attempt to make a cogent argument as to why this style of music is objectively or universally ""garbage,"" rather than just a pithy dismissal, I'm all ears :)"

catpranks,1vvwae,mcsharp,3,Thu Jan 23 03:46:35 2014 UTC,"I very rarely have a problem with the music itself. Usually it's very well-produced and written (there are exceptions), and the people who perform it are usually very skilled performers (there are definitely exceptions). My beef, when I have one, is more often with the value system associated with the music. Shallowness, apathy, misogyny, narcissism, greed, etc. Those are qualities that can show up both in the music and the lyrics. Sometime's it's just obvious that the producers absolutely did not care how the final product sounded because they knew that as long as Bieber (for example) was singing on top of it, it would sell. And that problem is by no means limited to tween-oriented pop, but it tends to be more visible in that genre than others."

catpranks,1vvwae,mcsharp,2,Thu Jan 23 04:08:35 2014 UTC,"Apparently, you're terrible for saying this...I was also amazed he had the drum line memorized. Mostly because it so rhythmically boring.  There are actually many sort-of empirical reasons why the music is...shall we say ""one-sided"". I also agree with you that this music is more about emotional expression...so maybe it has a certain raw, primal power to it. But as music goes, it is generally very limited- from an often complete lack of counterpoint to an extremely repetitive rhythmic pattern. It offers basically no modal variance or even dynamic inflection. Tonally it is also extremely limited. Obviously if someone likes something they like it. However if one is to attempt to analyze music at all and attribute certain aspects as pleasing or interesting this piece would be a complete failure with most criteria.  I think the discussion of art is generally a very interesting one. And valuable in that it can improve not only the art, but peoples' appreciation of art. What do we like and why? Saying people like different things is obvious and only defeats a potential discussion. We already know people like different things. But why, do you find this music of value? I personally do not for some of the reasons I listed above. It's repetitive, boring, atonal, unimaginative and it goes no where. And I don't like those things.   So instead of a downvote, how about you say why you think it's the fucking tits and maybe we'll all advance a little further down the road of life."

I had always thought it was because we had a glass table and he had learned that whenever he saw a toy mouse through the top of the table it really meant that it was under it, so would automatically stick his paws under instead of on. I figure he thought tablets were glass so it must work the same. Then he would get bored and lie on top of the tablet, which is apparently the best way to get a high score :/"

They don't punish the cat, because by the time they've dealt with the dog it's too late to do anything with the cat.  So the dog learns not to hurt the cat, but not vice versa.  Result is these videos.  Kind of sad that the dog has to live with a cat that knows it can do whatever it wants to the dog with impunity."

catpranks,1prnh9,Ker0Kero,28,Sat Nov 2 21:37:50 2013 UTC,"Most green lasers are 5mW class 3R lasers, which means that they can cause damage within a few seconds. Most red lasers are 1mW class 2 lasers that take minutes to cause permanent damage.  It's not a perfect rule - there are definetely safe green lasers and unsafe red ones - but it's true for 99% of lasers you'll ever see."
catpranks,1prnh9,orost,9,Sat Nov 2 21:42:36 2013 UTC,"Also human eye (most animals' too) is much more sensitive to the green color, as that's the strongest component of sunlight."

catpranks,1prnh9,Mr_Lobster,2,Sat Nov 2 23:59:07 2013 UTC,"It's not just the wattage/class that makes them dangerous. It's that almost all cheap green, or any color, 5mW lasers can emit up to 20 mW of infrared radiation because they don't use proper filterers, or any filters in some cases. So even looking at the dot on the ground or the beam can cause eye damage. Source."
catpranks,1prnh9,KAM1KAZ3,3,Sun Nov 3 01:36:36 2013 UTC,"or any color   Not really.  This is true of green lasers because they're basically just overpowering IR lasers in order to get green.  Violet/Blue/Red lasers don't suffer from this phenomenon because their output comes directly from a crystal and doesn't have to be sourced from IR like green does.   These devices create coherent green light in a three step process. A standard laser diode first generates near infrared light with a wavelength of 808nm. This is focused onto a neodymium crystal that converts the light into infrared with a wavelength of 1064nm. In the final step, the light passes into a frequency doubling crystal that emits green light at a wavelength of 532nm."

The cat, which was dumb, would haul ass across it, using his claws for traction.  When he reached a sharp corner, he'd dig in and kind of fling himself around it.  The carpet was gross.  We took it out.  There was polished hardwood floor underneath.  I caught him one day, sitting on the floor, staring at a wall, with his tongue out, being stupid.  I snuck up behind him and stomped on the floor and shouted BOO.   Cat took off with a scrabbling cartoon ""binka-binka-binka"" action.  He finally got up to speed, reached the corner, had nothing to grab onto, spun three times horizontally, flipped over about twice, got airborne, and slammed into a wall.  Sat there dazed for a few seconds, then took off nonchalantly.  ""Nothing has happened here.  Ever.""  Whee, cats."

Humor is extremely subjective, no?  Personally, I think this bit is a classic, and we have to look at it as a whole.  Is it so unreasonable that the child was in on the bit, and was prepared to be hoisted on his own soggy petard.  The bad guy getting what he is attempting to give has got to be one of the oldest, and most reliable comedic archetypes.

catpranks,1o1mnt,zirdante,32,Wed Oct 9 07:41:18 2013 UTC,"There's a bit of interesting science behind the Cat Righting Reflex , this was an attempt to study it.   At first glance, this reflex violates the law of Angular momentum, the cat was applying torque to their rotation, but were able to stop facing down without interacting with other objects. Imagine floating in space and being able to turn exactly 90 degrees and stop - without touching anything or using any propulsion; this would violate physics and worthy of being studied.   The conclusion of this is that cats are able to do this because their body is not treated as a single cylinder of rotating motion - but instead they bend their spine to create two cylinders rotating inwards. This starts to get real sciencey when it's described by nonholonomic systems.  TL;DR : Cats were able to defy physics, we wanted to know why."

The law of angular momentum only means that you can't change your angular velocity without interacting with other objects. You can change the direction you face by swinging limbs around and stuff, but your rotational velocity will be the same after the manouver.  If you start off not rotating, you'll be able to turn around a certain distance, then stop turning again. In this case, your angular velocity was zero both before and after the manouver.

This allows them to perform acrobatics in mid air that seem to not follow normal physics of momentum from our general idea of what is possible in the air.  That's how their righting to land on their feet mechanism also works. Allowing them to perform full body 180s and stop mid air to land perfectly upright without the momentum carrying their spin continuing. Unlike say a sky-diver who uses air friction to control his spin, they simply use their body to perform complex manoeuvres."

I was at one of my trucking companies drop yards getting a tire replaced. When the mechanic used the cheetah tire beader (a large tank of compressed air with a nozzle and quick release that pretty much explodes 100psi of air into the tire to force it onto the bead of the rim) the resulting BOOM caused a rabbit in the bushes to have a heart attack and die. Right there in front of us."

I do have one other problem, when I go on holiday he'll almost stop eating too. It drives the cat sitter nuts, the cat will only eat a little bit of dry food, that's it.

So funny to watch them walking up to their nest, looking up at this VERY OBVIOUS TRAP that's propped up over the nest, looking over at the VERY OBVIOUS group of 4 people that are all sitting 20 feet away, and the VERY OBVIOUS 20-foot-long white string that goes between the trap and the people, and the bird studies all these things for a few minutes and then just nonchalantly walks right under the trap and sits down happily on the nest.

catpranks,1gi3ct,knoblauch,10,Mon Jun 17 19:20:18 2013 UTC,"It's not particularly a matter of breed but rather coat coloring.  This particular pattern is called ""Tortoise Shell"", cats of this coloring are also often referred to as Torties.  I've had two in my life and my mother has one right now, as well.  The cats, primarily female, often have very strong personalities. They can be quite... for lack of a better term, bitchy. Very particular about who they socialize with, dominant in their homes, and generally pick one member of the household and that is their person. That's it. If they want to be petted, they will come to you, when they're done, you can screw off. Lol  For more information you can simply Google ""Tortoise Shell Cat"" and there is a real plethora of information on them.  Congrats on your new kitty."

catpranks,1e0mn6,1HitK0h,41,Thu May 9 21:33:44 2013 UTC,"Just because it subdues her physical reaction does not mean that she is actually calm emotionally. Although thoracic compression subdues physical activity in a number of mammals, there is little indication that this causes a significant change in their perception of their surroundings. Not only does this mean that the dog is capable of building an association between the thunder jacket and being terrified, but there is research that indicated a correlation between being restrained under distress (either physically or emotionally) and the development of PTSD.  I'd lose the thunder jacket unless you're seriously concerned that she may injure herself or others. Training dogs to cope with established phobias isn't nearly as easy as preventing them in the first place, but they do pick up on cues from the pack. Avoid trying to comfort her, as this confirms to her that something is amiss. Instead just try having fun and she'll hopefully get the idea that since nobody else is worried, that there may be nothing to worry about."
catpranks,1e0mn6,AnonymousHipopotamus,10,Fri May 10 04:46:38 2013 UTC,"Not sure I agree with you.  I have a 66lb Belgian Malinois (think K9 drug dog, that's what they are) who is TERRIFIED of thunderstorms.  Like, stand there shaking and teeth chattering like he's frozen in ice terrified. NOTHING calms him down...except a thundershirt.  Put that sucker on him, and he's chillin within 10 minutes or less, usually to the point of taking a nap.  And he's not just subdued, he's calm.  He also likes it in general, never resists having it put on and seems eager to have it on when thunder rolls in.  Then again...my dog is smarter than the smartest cat that ever lived, so that might have something to do with it as well."

Scratches and biting just hard enough to draw a little blood.  It was more than other cats would do and pretty painful, but not really dangerous.    Well she had some kittens and one day my parents 6 foot, 200 pound meat head friend decided he wanted to hold one.  So he sticks his hand in her hiding hole and mama cat goes berserk.  She latches onto his arm and gives it everything she's got.  He literally had to shake her off.  She bounced off the ground and without missing a beat chased the guy and tried to take him down like a lion on animal planet.  Dude was running and screaming and bleeding everywhere.  In that second or two she had hold of his arm she managed to slit his wrist badly enough to leave a trail of blood and cause him to go to the hospital.  That little 8 pound ball of fur and pointy bits damn near killed a full grown man 25 times her size.  That was when I realized that all my scratches and bite marks were from her holding back.  Pretty sure she could have killed me in my sleep if she wanted."

I would imagine it would be similar to the feeling of discomfort humans get when trying to perform some tasks with gloves on.  For example, try typing with gloves on.  You can feel it beneath your fingers, but you can't really feel the texture.  And it's actually quite bothersome.  Cats are just too dumb to be calm about this."

If someone posts a video from an archive like this of a slave being whipped, it would seem silly to point out that it's abuse, because that's the entire point of the video still existing.

You kidding me? That's like telling a gun shop THEY are retarded for selling the recent elementary school mass-shooter's mom a gun.  I'm glad the cat was safe too, but even if it wasn't it is the cat's fault.

Its in their genes or something I don't fuckin' know. Also cats can't really tell cause and effect or consider possible consequences that well. Because they're fucking cats. Not people.

I'm sorry but the ""fire in the hole"" prank trend was terrible while this one is absolutely hilarious for everyone. A prank isn't only funny if someone gets hurt, that's what asshole teenagers think are funny. You know what the difference is between this submission and this submission? The first is both harmless and hilarious, while the other you're supposed to find funny because the cat literally thinks its going to die.  The problem I have with this submission isn't that the cat got hurt its that it could have potentially ended badly for the cat.

The basis of your argument is that the cat apparently was wary of the tape, and therefore animal cruelty (because tape = kitten torture, apparently). That basis is an assumption that is very likely not true therefore making it baseless."
catpranks,16oxhz,otter111a,-15,Wed Jan 16 21:32:22 2013 UTC,"That's funny.  You also don't seem to know what parroted means.  When one parrots something back (as to a teacher) you repeat it to them exactly as they said it to you.  Since you did not teach me the meaning of the word baseless it was impossible for me to parrot it back to you.    Furthermore, I taught you the meaning of the word baseless by doing more than just quoting it to you from the dictionary.  In other words, providing a more thorough description.  This is also not parroting as it requires thought.    But all of this is neither here nor there.    I don't agree with you.  I don't care all that much that you don't agree with me.  I thought OP was stepping over a line and getting pleasure from repeatedly taping shit to his cat.    I think that's inhumane and if visitors to this subreddit feel bad that I made them feel bad about condoning that activity then so be it.  ""Aww....but its so funny tormenting cats.""

Kinda like the cup prank but with tape:  http://blog.shoplet.com/office-supplies/best-of-office-weekend-roundup-82/attachment/water-cup-prank/  OP just didn't have the balls to take it to the next level.  Man that would be the ultimate harmless prank!  Its just tape!    You were right and I was wrong.    When you do this, right before you let your cat go into that room look right into the camera and say ""Does this look like torture to you otter111a?

catpranks,14gue8,LANCESTAAAA,59,Mon Feb 11 01:07:38 2013 UTC,"Pretty sure because of the maternal instinct to carry cats like this. Cat's really don't mind to be carried around by that spot, however I wouldn't carry a fat fully grown cat like that.  Edit: I wonder if you carried clips around, if you just do this to some random cat on the street, how long do you think it would lay there, or would cat sense finally prevail and it's patience wear thin?"
catpranks,14gue8,HaMMeReD,59,Fri Dec 7 23:53:44 2012 UTC,"Since this is the top comment I'll post this here: For anyone who doesn't know, this is dangerous to do while PICKING UP the cat (any cat larger than a small kitten, that is). Pinch the scruff (and not the actual neck) as much as you want, but do not try picking up your cat that way like its mother would when it was a baby."
catpranks,14gue8,callitparadise,10,Sat Dec 8 00:39:49 2012 UTC,"I agree, if it's a kitten maybe, but as soon as it gets to a certain  size/age it needs to grow up and probably is not good for the cat.  As a kid though, I carried cats like this all the time and never hurt one. Still don't do it to big cats.  Edit: and even if it's a kitten, you probably don't need to carry it like this, because we have hands."
catpranks,14gue8,HaMMeReD,5,Sat Dec 8 00:59:37 2012 UTC,"That's my point when I said ""cat"" but I guess I should specify any cat larger than a kitten. It's just from the fact that its body is too heavy for its neck to support like that, at that point."
catpranks,14gue8,callitparadise,1 point,Sat Dec 8 01:16:29 2012 UTC,It's still useful for carrying cats/kittens that for some reason don't want to be carried. You can support it with the other hand or whatever.

catpranks,14gue8,callitparadise,6,Sat Dec 8 01:25:06 2012 UTC,Yes I'm assuming a lion cub would have a stronger neck to be able to support its body as a baby. Lion cubs are usually much stronger/bigger built than kittens anyway.

Really cuddled up to it and brushed his face against it and that kind of thing and the cat clearly disliked this.   One morning my friend got dressed, grabbed his bag and took off for college, just to find out on the train half way that his beloved cat had shat all over the inside of his bag and smeared it all over his books.  Cat justice was served that day."

I happened upon this magical place after traveling to the comment section of the video of the cat jumping on a counter covered in tin foil. If your tale is the same as mine, I'd like you to come join me in a jolly quest across all of reddit-dom, full of magic and fancy. We shall call ourselves the Troupe of the Lazy Sunday, exploring the deep, vast comment wilderness of reddit, adding our say to months.. nay, years old threads where nary a soul will see.

I believe this is how it most likely happened..   I was lurking in /r/catswithmustaches and stumbled across a link to /r/Catsntits which brought me to the subbreddit /r/tits.. which distracted me for a good 30min.. I then got back on to reddit.com and found a link to /r/FoodPorn. I then decided to get some lunch.   I then found my way back to reddic.com again and found the link for /r/catpranks. I then clicked on top posts for this subbreddit. Found this video.  And here I am talking to you!"

catpranks,12na25,Jucoy,2,Sat Jan 12 10:41:54 2013 UTC,It would appear so. Ive read the comments from the several times this has been posted on the more populat boards of reddit and some people shared stories of similar experiences from when their cat's realized they were controlling the red laser pointer.

catpranks,1diu22,Br0kenMind,5,Thu May 2 15:49:11 2013 UTC,One day you'll find your roboraptor utterly destroyed by your cat in revenge. ;p
catpranks,1diu22,FiXato,8,Thu May 2 11:17:17 2013 UTC,In reference to my earlier post.  This video is of Danger as he battles for his life against Black Roboraptor.  Who will win the toy?!?
catpranks,1diu22,luck_as_a_constant,2,Thu May 2 01:40:42 2013 UTC,What breed is your cat?

catpranks,1g3ezr,mpavlofsky,27,Tue Jun 11 03:09:13 2013 UTC,"Please don't scruff cats unnecessarily. If they are being aggressive/need to be restrained, sure. But not just for fun.  Also as orost and EnclaveLeo said, please support their weight when you do so. While scruffing in itself doesn't cause pain, the weight of their bodies being suspended like that does.   While working at a veterinary hospital, we would only scruff as a last resort. It's not very comfortable for the cat and can make them off put to the whole situation. Brushing should be a fun bonding time for you and your cat, not a time to paralyze them and possibly hurt them.   Edit* didn't give acknowledgment to orost."
catpranks,1g3ezr,NicoleASUstudent,3,Tue Jun 11 05:15:36 2013 UTC,I made a similar comment on the youtube video its self.

catpranks,1g3ezr,orost,4,Tue Jun 11 07:25:46 2013 UTC,"That's because he's holding the cat's neck, which causes the cat to go limp/unresponsive/freeze up. It is used when mother cats carry their kittens. To my knowledge it is not really harmful to the cat."
catpranks,1g3ezr,IDCimSTRONGERtnUinRL,14,Tue Jun 11 03:34:39 2013 UTC,"You can hold them by the scruff to calm them down, but you should also support their weight in some other way. Adult cats are to heavy to be held just by the neck. Kittens are fine."
catpranks,1g3ezr,EnclaveLeo,2,Tue Jun 11 04:28:02 2013 UTC,There has to be some sort of time limit before it fucks up the cats brain though right?
catpranks,1g3ezr,ben_ehrlich423,9,Tue Jun 11 03:36:11 2013 UTC,"I just looked it up and some places said it wasn't harmful at all, while others said its not okay to pick up as an adult because of their weight."
catpranks,1kxbym,donasay,10,Fri Aug 23 05:10:02 2013 UTC,"I think that is just cruel. Sticky tape on the feet and laser pointers are funny, this little fella was terrified."
catpranks,1kxbym,spoojee,3,Fri Aug 23 13:50:19 2013 UTC,"100%.  I've had cats, and you can bathe them - but you hold them and talk softly through the whole thing, and they get through it OK.  I love a good cat prank as much as the next guy, but this is just mean."
catpranks,1kxbym,UCCF,2,Fri Aug 23 16:26:57 2013 UTC,That's awful!!
