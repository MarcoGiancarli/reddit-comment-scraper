For Connor, it's because how determined he is, his morals and knows the line between good and evil. I love how he doesn't take shit from anybody and he fights for what he believes in. I also like how he doesn't have much forgiveness for those that wrong him. His character is very straightforward, not much sarcasm or charisma, which is the reason some hate him, but for others it's his best characteristic. For Edward, I just fell in love with the character as we got closer to the end of Assassin's Creed 4. The change of his personality and his priorities was so well executed in the game. I liked that even though he was a pirate, he was still a great and kind person, lost and trying to find a path in life. But by the end of the game he knows his place and role in this world, as a father and an assassin. He, in my opinion, has the best ending in a game. Yes, even better than Revelations."

He has a charm and wit about him, but you can see he is driven too.

This will crash their carriage and create an obstacle for other pursuers. - AC Syndicate once again gives you the ability to carry and conceal dead bodies. - AC Syndicate will also allow the player to retrieve dead bodies from hiding locations. - Throwing knives can create distractions to lure enemies to specific spots. - Losing a fight can now mean watching Jacob get executed by his enemies. It is more gruesome and humiliating than ever before. - 19th Century adverts fill the streets of London, and are interesting and colourful. - Bloody Nora can be killed before the Gang War. It's possible for the player to stop and kill her on route to the battle by intercepting her carriage. - If you choose to do this, Jacob will take Bloody Nora's scarf to wave triumphantly in the Gang War. - Instead of being greeted by Nora, Jacob displays Nora's scarf to the rival gang."

assassinscreed,3e1yc5,oceanking,3,Tue Jul 21 10:05:57 2015 UTC,"Napoleon and Arno weren't really allies in the game except when they happened to shared common goals like finding out where the king stashed his secret stuff and getting rid of Rouille. Also, a bit of time happened in between dead kings and the catacomb scene, so something could've happened in that period such as Arno getting friendlier with Napoleon. It seemed like the game was hinting at the possibility of a sequel to show what happens during that time. In addition, you can be friends with someone and still understand that it wouldn't be a good idea for them to get absolute power."

Can you ask Mr. McDevitt:   If Connor was aware and ever got in touch with his aunt? What was the nature of Connor and Aveline's relationship and their opinions of each other? Were they like really close friends, or barely spoke to each other aside from matters concerning the Brotherhood? Also, Ubisoft said in the past that they were in favor of a ConnorxAveline relationship but decided against it because of they were too different? How were they different (because honestly, they seemed really similar in my opinion)? How many kids did Connor and Aveline have? What was the fate of the Homestead and the United States Assassin Brotherhood? And most importantly, did Connor and Shay ever meet? If he could have an extra story for any of the previous protagonists, who would it be? Was Connor in touch with the French Brotherhood, especially during the French Revolution?"

Will there ever be a chance to have a main AC game that takes place centuries before Syndicate?   What is your personal favourite location to set an AC game in the future?  Will we see a return of the former ACInitiates that tracked Modern Day Assassins?  You wrote the famous lines that describe what ""Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted"" is in ACRe. Has the writing team at Ubisoft ever had a different understanding of the creed? Do you feel as if the creed has a separate meaning in different time periods?"

The fights on the roofs, the on-the-go hijacking, the chases all seem like a great addition and something different. However, as a mean of transportation, I really wish that regular horseback riding was still in the game. It might not have been popular at that time and carriages might have been what most people used, but I just horses to return after 3 games without them.    Also, I think it was the game Sleeping Dogs, which was like a GTA in Tokyo, where you could do hijacks while the car was still moving and there was a lot of action tied to the driving system, the carriages in Syndicate kind of remind me of that."

Yes, it was better than floating iPad McGee, but imo Desmond was underused from the absolute very beginning.   If AC3 truly was going to be Desmond only with no historical section, then I can maybe see them giving him a stronger finish, but we spent maybe 40 minutes as Dezzy in AC2. Probably less."
assassinscreed,3e0iaw,NeoNugget,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:24 2015 UTC,"The best way to do it would've been having the first three games be the Desmond trilogy, where you have AC1 tell Altair's story, then AC2 tell Ezio's story including the story told in Brotherhood. AC3 would've been all-Desmond, just like Patrice wanted, and concluded that as one whole trilogy. Then AC3, AC4, and ACRo would've had their Abstergo entertainment meta-narrative but actually carry the same protagonist through all three."

assassinscreed,3dwg00,papa_smurphy,17,Mon Jul 20 03:40:31 2015 UTC,They did that with Haytham.  Remember how they said Evie is 25% of the game? Haytham was 25% of AC3.

Compare the time spent plaything through Haytham's sequences to the time spent as Connor doing all the Homestead missions, all the hunting quests, all the exploration and main missions, and all the time it takes to 100% the game.

assassinscreed,3dusw4,Mr_Xing,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:38:00 2015 UTC,Are you me? You just perfectly described how I feel about the series!
assassinscreed,3dusw4,Loopy_Duck,25,Mon Jul 20 06:22:45 2015 UTC,"I think one of my main problems that is contributing to my fatigue of the series is that the games have just become too long. Up until Revelations each game took me 20-30 hours to do get 100% synchronization (excluding AC1, where I didn't bother to collect all the flags). From AC3 onwards, each game has hit around the 80 hour mark, with the exception of Rogue which took 40 hours. I actually spent more time on my first playthrough of AC3 than I had spent on the first playthrough of each of the previous 4 AC games combined.  I'm 50 hours into Unity and I've not even uncovered half the map. I'm at about 40% synchronization. Now I get that all the side activities are completely optional, but here's the thing: the existence of these side activities has a large impact on how the main story is structured.  By this I mean two things: the story of the main sequence becomes harder to follow because you are spending so much time doing side activities between each mission. Because of this, the developers design the main story to be less linear and more just a series of events that have a loose narrative strand connecting them - they do this precisely because they are anticipating that people won't really be following the story since they are going to be so preoccupied doing side activities.   There are a lot of antagonists who just suddenly appear with little or no foreshadowing and quite often (when I'm playing anyway) I often don't really know why Arno has to kill this person or break into that building. Maybe I have some vague reason floating about in my mind, but it never really goes beyond ""the assassination target is working with someone who is bad and killing them might get me closer to finding my real target somehow"". Now, I play a lot of games and I play games mainly for the story but I have more trouble following the plot in AC than in any other title, including things like Metal Gear Solid which is famed for having a confusing story.  The other thing that the length does is that it means that every year since AC3 I've literally just finished the previous AC before I go into the new one. Up until the end of the Ezio trilogy I usually finished each game around February-April, then I had a good 5 or 6 months break before starting the next one. Now it's usually a case of desperately rushing to finish the current AC game around September so that I can finish it in time for the next one. Cramming all that time playing AC right before a new AC game comes out means I'm already burnt out on the series by the time I start the new one. I could of course just play all the games at my own leisure, but I don't want to fall behind for fear of getting to the point where I'll just never be able to catch up with the series again.  So for me, I'd prefer it if the games became much shorter and more story focused. Resources should be poured into making the main sequence much stronger and more linear with a clearly defined narrative, with most of the side activities taken out. The maps are also too large: Paris could have been half the size it was and I wouldn't have noticed (I've barely even touched the South side). If they really want to give us a lot of space to explore, then give us separate smaller locations like they did in AC2.  So for me it's not so much the annual release that is contributing to the sense of franchise fatigue, it's the fact that the games have become too bloated. You don't release an 80-100 hour epic every year and expect people to keep with you without becoming exhausted."
assassinscreed,3dusw4,VarricTethras,15,Sun Jul 19 18:45:09 2015 UTC,"For me, it's also because the stories are starting to become much more... well nonsensical.  I don't get why the Assassins were so against the people revolting against the exploitative and sadistic upper class in Unity.  Arno literally mentions to the council ""Isn't this what you want?  The people rising up for liberty, equality, etc.?"" which gets an answer of ""Well, our leader told the king everything because he's a dumbass and we can't let everyone know about our secret afterschool club.""  What kind of leadership is that?  There's even missions where people are protesting and the voiceover tells you ""Make sure it's a peaceful protest! We don't want this to be violent!""  Really?  The Assassins, who murder people left and right are going to preach about peaceful protest?  I also don't get why ACIII didn't have Connor and Achilles trying to rebuild the Assassins numbers by recruiting more Native Americans, especially from Connor's tribe.  The Templars were all white men who were trying to invade the Native's land.  Wouldn't it be smart to recruit the Natives to your side?  Why not move the Assassins headquarters from Achilles's house to Connor's tribe or something?  The Assassins no longer feel like they're acting in a smart manner.   It's the same with the modern day Assassins.  The Templars invested in huge businesses and technologies to better achieve their goals.  What of the Assassins?  They're just small groups of apparently hackers and annoying snarky British guys with idiot leaders like William Miles scattered across the globe.  They just react against the Templars rather than actually doing anything to progress humanity.  Because of that, they've become almost nonexistant in the modern day and, in my opinion, have no real chance of beating the Templars at all.  I think Sun Tzu said it best: ""Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.""  /rant"
assassinscreed,3dusw4,_LifeIsAbsurd,3,Sun Jul 19 23:43:39 2015 UTC,"I like your perspective. What I feel really had an impact on the direction of the series was the departure of Patrice Desilets who created the AC franchise and then directed both AC and AC II, and AC: B for a bit. Heck even the modern ending of AC:B seemed a little rushed."
assassinscreed,3dusw4,rf32797,11,Mon Jul 20 01:15:40 2015 UTC,"Spot on. I got the platinum trophies for AC II, AC:B, and AC:Re, but doing everything in AC III just seemed like a chore. I feel like the story really does need some work, and the development of some of the characters."
assassinscreed,3dusw4,Mermaid_Splashes,4,Sun Jul 19 18:51:13 2015 UTC,"I felt the exact same way in AC:3, yet when I did 100% I enjoyed every second of it. It's kinda sad that AC:4 is feeling more and more like an anomaly."
assassinscreed,3dusw4,yaminub,7,Sun Jul 19 23:44:29 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad there are other people who feel this way besides me. What you said was so spot on. I always thought to myself, am I crazy for thinking there are too many side activities in a game? If I complain about them, will I just be told to skip them if I don't like them? But like you said, if you skip the sidequests, it becomes obvious how disconnected the plot is. And, in some cases, how short the plot is.  The best example of this is Rogue. The plot itself in that game is so ridiculously short that it was almost a half game, or a supplemental game to bridge the events of ACIV with ACIII, and also to introduce the concept of making the player sympathize with the Templars to some degree. This is fine, and I don't have a problem with any of that. But there are so many side activities that really weighed the game down - enough to equal a game of full length. I played through them because I didn't realize how short Rogue was plot-wise, and then all of a sudden, before I knew it, the credits were rolling. A game with a long plot and a lot of side quests tends to wear me out as it is, but a short game with so many of them just seemed ridiculous.   I was always a fairly casual gamer, and the AC series was one of the few games I played on the PS3 aside from The Last of Us. Now I'm at a point where I'm debating getting a PS4 pretty much solely to play these games, or dropping out of the franchise and getting a Wii U to play the Mario games that I find myself enjoying more.   I will say that I really enjoyed ACIV though. It kept me interested and seemed to flow pretty well, and told a more linear, entertaining story I didn't mind the side missions, because I was invested and interested enough in the plot that they didn't seem to weigh things down. But the storylines of III and Rogue felt very disjointed to me, like ""kill this guy, follow that guy, now go over there, now go talk to Benjamin Franklin, now kill that other guy, and don't question us as to why you're doing any of this."" So yeah, I'm really on the fence about moving on to the next-gen games, when it will take a fair amount of financial investment in order for me to do so.  The funny thing is that this is why I gave up on the Final Fantasy series. So much sidequesting and level-grinding required to advance in the increasingly complicated storylines that I just kind of threw in the towel. I'm really sad that it's happening with another franchise I used to love."

But after a few months of not touching any assassins game I play unity and was happy I had so much stuff to do without worrying about a story to speak of. I think if you try and knock all 100 % sync out at once your gonna be fed up with it really easy but if you put it to the side for a while I think it's fun again. I mean just the running is pretty awesome there are not a lot of franchises that even come close to such a good mechanic. Plus the settings are insanely nice I spent my second time around just walking the streets so I can see everything, because it's such a pretty game!"
assassinscreed,3dusw4,D4FTPUNKF4N,2,Mon Jul 20 00:51:08 2015 UTC,the story of the main sequence becomes harder to follow because you are spending so much time doing side activities between each mission.    You've hit the nail on the head so hard. I'm embarrassed to say despite being generally great at follow plot (English Lit degree/TV and film critic) I barely follow the recent AC games whatsoever... or only on such a superficial level that once the game is turned off I realise I don't know anybody's name beyond the protags'.

assassinscreed,3dusw4,Zero--Regen,4,Sun Jul 19 22:26:35 2015 UTC,"I've been feeling the fatigue since AC:II. Right when they started an annual release schedule I knew I was going to lose interest in the series.   AC:II was one of the most interested, well-designed and immersive games I have played. I really really enjoyed almost every aspect of it. AC:B and Revelations improved on some mechanics in AC:II but (IMO) never came close to how awe inspiring AC:II was for me. They were essentially AC:II clones with different cities.   AC:III just made me sad. I had such high hopes for a Rev War era game and it really was underwhelming for me. Connor was a bad protagonist and the Desmond storyline (which I had been keeping up with via extra lore this whole time) was too far out there and odd for me.   Black Flag was a breath of fresh air. I got it for Christmas a bit after release and I loved it. Probably put 50-60 hours in and cleared almost the whole game. The mechanics were solid, story and protagonist were different and setting was unique for the AC Universe.   Unity.... well, I didn't but it at release because I was still shell-shocked from the Master Chief Collection debacle, and man was I glad I held off. I actually never bought it, my friend gave me a download code for free. I have tried twice now to get into Unity and I just can't. The environment is gorgeous but Arno and the plot as a whole just aren't compelling to me.   I think this all comes down to the fact that Assassin's Creed sold out and started pushing yearly releases. It was a blatant money grab, Ubisoft traded game quality for profit. It worked in the short term, people snapped up everything after AC:II, but in the end it led to the embarrassment that was Unity and unfortunately caused me to lose interest in the series.   I LOVED this series, it was hands down my favorite action game. Now its just a line on a profit spreadsheet for Ubisoft, and that really comes out in the experience. The mystique, thrill and sense of awe I got from AC:I and II are gone for me.   TL;DR: I started feeling the fatigue after AC:II. The series lost its unique flair when Ubi started pumping out yearly releases and making money-grabs with crappy DLC."
assassinscreed,3dusw4,CamaroM,2,Mon Jul 20 00:45:38 2015 UTC,"I couldn't have said it better man. When I look at some other franchises, Metal Gear Solid, Dark Souls series, etc. I feel like each release is well developed to achieve a greater effect but at the same time stays true to its roots even when it's trying to be innovative. Assassin's Creed II felt so amazing because of many small changes that were made. From Assassin's Creed to AC II, there was a huge leap in quality and content. I felt to immersed in the AC world and lore. But then with AC III and what followed I just got so lost. Like what happened with all this Juno stuff? Now, when I play an Assassin's Creed game I'm not really immersed in that world. It seems silly with the whole ""Go kill him,"" or you must do this certain thing to get full sync. Assassin's Creed to me was originally about freedom, and now it feels to forced and not fun."

I wasn't lucky enough to start playing since the 1st game's release, but after I played 1&2 Brotherhood was coming out, so that's when I started anticipating and playing them yearly."
assassinscreed,3dusw4,GalakFyarr,3,Mon Jul 20 02:22:00 2015 UTC,"I don't like it like I used to. the old games were great, the only games I bought on release, but since AC:B, I now just wait for a cheap deal on them. Got Unity for free, still haven't bought Rogue (though I plan on getting it when it's like $10). The Batman Arkham series just feels like better AC to me right now by far."
assassinscreed,3dusw4,KCdash,4,Sun Jul 19 19:54:40 2015 UTC,That's why we should not pre-order or even buy Syndicate. I still love the series but the direction that AC went to is really . . really bad. I will vote with my money by not buying this game until they decided to stop milking this game and take some time to make a really good one.
assassinscreed,3dusw4,salexy,3,Mon Jul 20 02:13:27 2015 UTC,"The only thing I get burned out on are the collectibles.  I hope Ubisoft reduces them by 75%, because 100+ collectibles that are required for 100% sync, please stahp.  Also, opening 1 chest with 10k money is more fun than opening 100 chests with 100¬£ in them. So please, lock that one chest behind 5 level 3 doors guarded by 25 guards each, that's fine, but stop using an AA12 shotgun to place collectibles that are worthless all over the map - or if you still want to, do it like it was in AC2/B: not required for 100% sync.  As for the rest, while I was disappointed in Unity's story, I still enjoyed playing the game itself and the gorgeous city. I don't think I can get burned out on the series because one of the major selling points for me is just the historical city. If the story keeps sucking, I'll probably not buy day 1 that's all (not that I am going to buy Day 1 this time since I can't run the games anymore anyway)"

What do you get for collecting a majority of the cockades? congrats you got a new clothing color. What do you get after solving all those (annoying) nostradamus enigmas? congrats you unlocked whats basically an Altair variation outfit with no special properties. Artifacts? just a bunch of low level gear that you're probably already far past needing.   They should've at least given us some rare artifact that can give a chance to deflect bullets or lower damage like in Black Flag because with that body shield move gone dealing with guns just got tons more annoying with that matrix dodge (which is/looks stupid) which fails to activate half the time when the icon glows red or dodge rolling everywhere and getting hit by a melee guy in the process. In fact combat doesn't seem that fun now that they made it ""harder"" to the point I spam smokescreen in big groups of enemies just so I don't have to deal with their guns."

The Kenway Saga is my favorite thing about the series, and Rogue is my overall favorite game.  I liked Unity for the change in parkour and scale of the city, the story left something to be desired, but the game is good enough that I'll replay it before Syndicate comes out.  So yea, as long as the quality is maintained, keep the yearly releases coming."
assassinscreed,3dusw4,Filmesis,2,Mon Jul 20 01:01:49 2015 UTC,"I'd like to agree with you, but I just can't. For me the quality just progressively gets worse. I wouldn't mind it taking a break.

Also, i'm really tired of the kind of missions you always get every year in assassin creed with the same shity gameplay with every assassin creed games. so yeah, i skipped the last assassin creed and from what i've heard it was an epic failure and i'm not planing to buy the new one.

assassinscreed,3dusw4,sav86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:12:45 2015 UTC,"It is the culture for me I guess...and the fact that it seems more realistic than most other games. I understand the frustration the brothers and sisters had after AC3. Growing up I learned at a young age not to get too excited about things. It was good that I was taught this because getting let down doesn't hurt as much. I thought Desmond as a character was at his finest in ACB. I still wish I could buy that white shirt with a red eagle on it. Instead of getting mad at them I tried to think logically about Desmond's death. Haha, I can't count how many times I have said this on this subreddit. I think by killing him it makes it more realistic. I think a large part of our culture is Hollywoodized. Everyone, wants the good guy to come out smelling like roses and unscratched. But that isn't the case. I think by doing that there is this pressure placed on Shaun and Rebecca. A pressure that means they have to work double time or find replacements. But even then, when you lose someone that you have worked with for a long time and trust it is hard to replace them. I think the thing that pissed me off was how slow it seemed they made the two work on destroying Abstergo. I would have expected them to be employees rather than a mini coffee shop worker and a mail carrier. But I guess there is less depth used on background checks on a guy serving coffee then working on a machine with sensitive info. That is just the modern day aspect. There are a few other things but I just get tired of talking anymore than about the amount I have written so far."

I don't plan to get Syndicate until it's really cheap because at this point I see no point in getting hyped or following any news, it's lost it's touch but I haven't played all the earlier games so I guess I can go back to those"
assassinscreed,3dusw4,MusteloGris,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:42:33 2015 UTC,"I don't have high hopes for Syndicate as it looks like a reskinned Unity outside of the setting being different with a few new mechanics at best. Don't see the modern storyline returning either, as I think they started development on this game before fans started complaining abut the plot. That, and I honestly think enough people don't give two shits about the story or how Ubisoft ruined it, but instead keep buying the games regardless. At least this is the impression that I'm left with since every Youtuber or game critic I know of has yet to criticize Ubisoft for ruining AC's story, as if they're unaware of this happening.  Won't be buying Syndicate, at least not on release day. But then again I also held off from buying The Witcher 3 until several bugs were squished, and that's a great game. Depends how good Syndicate is, reviews will let me know."

The only one I skipped was the America one where you played the native. It's the same formula all the time and the story hasn't gotten any better so it's a tough sell to play these games year in year out.   To be honest the only reason why I'm playing Unity (as this is my last game I'm choosing to play) is because I'm French and the source material is making up for the lack of a plot. That and I bought the game so I'm personally vested in finishing it. I hate to ""give up"" on games so I'm seeing it through to the end with this one."
assassinscreed,3dusw4,Nisha_the_lawbringer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:02:29 2015 UTC,I mostly agree with you. I don't think the ending to ac3 was bad. I actually liked it even though I loved Desmond. My problem is that the story really hasn't advanced since. We are just stuck in limbo. To me what made assassins creed was the over arching story line. I have little desire to play a game about a pirate with out the broader context. Same for unity I have played them all but I am getting tired of it. I will play syndicate because I game share and my bud is buying it but if the rich narrative that caused me to fall in love with the series doesn't return it's probably my last. Who would have thought the death of Desmond meant death to the meta story. üò¢üò°üò≠üòñ

I do agree that without taking time between installments, however, Ubisoft's flagshpi franchise has been copy-pasting marketing everywhere; even if the individual Assassins are only decent and the storylines are sometimes Unity, I feel that it's hearing, ""This is the baddest of the bad, bro,"" every year is what's dragging it down for me. On top of that, bugs and glitches are bad."

It's like a love child of Gandal's Fall from The Bridge of Khazud Dum (Howard Shore, The Lord of the Rings) and Adiago in D minor (John Murphy, Sunshine) - which, by the way, are two of the most beautiful pieces of music ever composed.

assassinscreed,3dvzxz,forknox,7,Mon Jul 20 12:40:36 2015 UTC,"Well this should be a popular topic    Honestly, I think it's very hard to tell to tell right now but I think the setting of Syndicate should give us a clue. The setting of Syndicate doesn't look that different visually from Unity. Of course the culture and time period are different but this is similar to setting a game in China right after one in Japan. The gameplay doesn't seem that radically different either.IMO Syndicate feels like filler. The devs don't even seem as excited as they were for Unity. I think the next game will be a very different aesthetic experience compared to  Unity and Syndicate.  Possibly in the East with a more colorful pallet compared to the urban tones along with big gameplay changes. I also think people should not ignore popular settings like China,  India and Russia done in alternate media . We are getting a game set in England after already visiting it in Forsaken. India has been a favorite of mine for a long time. I think it makes sense to go there after Victorian England as they can easily expand upon the lore that will be established in Syndicate. What with the British Raj and all. Also India would provide a vibrant mix of cultures from European to Asian and Middle Eastern. Not to mention weapons like Chakrams and whip swords. As well as some of the oldest martial arts in existence such as Kalaripayattu and Vajra Mushti.  The best fan art for a potential setting is definitely that really popular one for China. I wish that artist would do the same for other settings. While a game set during the British Raj seems the most likely at this moment,  I would prefer one during the rise of Aurangzeb in the Mughal Empire.  Aurangzeb was the son of Shah Jahan, the man who built the Taj Mahal. In a war of succession, he defeated his older brother became king. He imprisoned his father in a fort from where he could see the tomb of his beloved  i.e The Taj Mahal. I think it would be nice to see the Assassins helping the deposed king take down his tyrannical son. As Aurangzeb goes on his conquest, the hero could weaken his power by targeting his followers back at the capital (Delhi). Eventually,  you could aid the Marathi Hero Shivaji against Aurangzeb and make the hard choice of taking part in destruction of the Mughal Empire in order to bring about a better time.(The Koh-I-Noor from Brahman would also figure into the story as various rulers were fighting for possession of it.  The Mughals had trade and diplomatic relations with the Italians of rennaissance Italy and while the gem was in the possession of Aurangzeb,  it was cut by an Italian jeweler by the name of Hortenso Borgia!)"

Guns are popular enough for the assassins to have them, but not to the point of everyone having them, invalidating the hidden blade completely, cities are big enough for the parkour element to make sense, and it was an age full of discoveries that could fit well with the most 'conspiracy-laden' side of the series. Though I'd like for more games in the 15th or 16th centuries (just not with Ezio anymore).  I don't know enough about history to tell of a particularly interesting time, however. History classes here in Brazil are very 'Brazil-centric"", so I don't know enough about the history of other countries to think about a particularly interesting moment in time (and our history isn't interesting enough for the AC series, I think, although there are a few possibilities)."

assassinscreed,3dvzxz,PaDe1988,7,Mon Jul 20 07:42:00 2015 UTC,"I think UbiSoft located upcoming games in contemporary times (Berlin during World War II, tensions between pre-World War countries, the Cold War, the Russian Revolution, Imperialism Africa over, the fall of the Berlin wall, etc.). From here they can get two things: either the saga sink completely because Ubi makes the series in a shooter, or the saga ""reborn"" (to put it in some way) since Ubi adapts the characteristic secrecy of the first games saga modern atmospheres. If Ubi does things right, they would come good games. These atmospheres attracts me a lot, but in the Middle Ages and there are sooo good old atmospheres:   Explore huge medieval castles with dungeons, caves, tunnels, etc. Accompany Joan of Arc while freeing France Fight battles as Agincourt in the Hundred Years' War Escape the Inquisition Explore the forests of England being an archer with Robin Hood Release of Muslim Spain Alexander accompany their campaigns.

assassinscreed,3dvzxz,greetingsfromcanada,3,Mon Jul 20 05:31:46 2015 UTC,I never though of Spain as a setting before. I think almost any major event there would be great
assassinscreed,3dvzxz,spikebrennan,3,Mon Jul 20 06:31:23 2015 UTC,"I think the series is headed into the 20th Century. I hope they don't push it too far though. WW1 and then back in time for good. WW1 is the most modern time period the series should explore. It has great potential and Ubisoft can easily get around the issue of the guns. WW1 saw the rise of modern espionage so the game would be largely behind the scenes. There's great potential for an interesting story. I really liked that fan art for Meiji Japan. It'd be a great setting. The year is 1914. Europe. The threat of war looms. The Assassin's and Templars are deeply entrenched (no pun intended) in Europe's governments, continuing their never ending conflict from the shadows. The conflict is exacerbated when a madman finds an artifact and plunges Europe into a full scale war. Behind the scenes, the Assassin/Templar conflict has renewed as both sides attempt to retrieve the artifact. I haven't decided where I'd make the player character from though."
assassinscreed,3dvzxz,forknox,3,Mon Jul 20 00:20:17 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe the next game is going to be set in 19th century Wild West. Why?

assassinscreed,3dvzxz,flowmarine,2,Mon Jul 20 01:56:36 2015 UTC,I still think the Thirty years' war would be a great setting with maybe some dipping into the eighty years' war. Lots of different characters with different motives and lots of places to visit.
assassinscreed,3dvzxz,EvilEyor,2,Mon Jul 20 15:36:02 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that the next AC will go to Ancient Egypt. There were a lot of hints in Unity and Dead Kings.

Ancient Egypt vague story pitch: Find the Ankh/Shroud :p  Ancient Rome vague story pitch: I'm not sure, but we should totally just stab Caesar.  Ancient Greece vague story pitch: I've been doing some research into ostracism, maybe we could follow a wrongfully exiled Assassin try to reclaim the Creed? I really want to see an Assassin coup."
assassinscreed,3dvzxz,RokutenVerzwei,2,Mon Jul 20 21:00:54 2015 UTC,"I think AC will stay in 19th-century Europe. I believe mid-19th century Russia (either St. Petersburg or Moscow) might be a nice continuation of Unity and Syndicate generation. Now where I want series to go is another question. I'm not that interested in asian setting, however something exotic and never seen before like Singapore can be quite fascinating. Same goes with ancient times - AC belongs to middle ages and renaissance with settings all across the Mediterranean. Thirty Years' War would've been great as an epic saga (like Ezio trilogy). Athens, Seville, Izmir, Cairo, Hamburg, Munich, Vienna... list can go on and on. Have a look at Segovia and then tell me you wouldn't want to climb atop the Cathedral. Heck, you can even see all the syncronization towers."

Here's my ideas:  ‚Äì The series will probably go to the WWII now, making an Assassin who fights the Nazi inside Germany. After that, they'll probably go to the past again.   ‚Äì I really wanted them to explore the Sengoku period of Japan, but not as a ninja but as a Samurai. They could allow the main character to choose between several fighting styles with the same weapon and allow the purchase and conquer of lands, diplomatic missions on the day and assassination on the  night, full-scale battles and alliances with NPCs."
assassinscreed,3dvzxz,MusteloGris,2,Mon Jul 20 00:43:14 2015 UTC,"Where it'll go: Ubisoft knows it has to listen to the fanbase on something soon, or it'll be banking on Syndicate to keep the series afloat. So it'll probably be Ancient Rome, Egypt, or Meiji-era Japan.  Where I want it to go: Putting down the Highland uprisings in 1600-1700 as Templars, building the Mongol Empire as Templars, and Viking Raids 800-950 as Templars. Call it the Conquering Trilogy. After that, I want to see a ""Jaganda""-style game in Brazil as an Assassin, an Inca game (Assassins pushing back against Templar conquistadors), and a Mexican Revolution deal as an Assassin. Call it the Liberating Trilogy. Take my money. Also, would like to see u/Lwsrocks right storylines for all of these, or at least one.  Favorite fan art: Definitely the Meiji-era stuff, can't find it right now but hot damn it was good."
assassinscreed,3dvzxz,Lwsrocks,2,Mon Jul 20 12:18:29 2015 UTC,"As much as I love the Inca and desire for pre-Columbian/pre-Spanish Americas, I don't see it happening, because it honestly looks like the Assassin-Templar war was contained east of the Atlantic. Until everyone started crawling to the new world.  Still would be pretty freaking cool!"
assassinscreed,3dvzxz,Valtari5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:48:36 2015 UTC,"Technically, the conflict goes back to before recorded history; it could be that the Inca were the pinnacle of an Assassin-based society or something, and that over time, they were ""diluted"", so to speak. In AC3, we saw that natives still had an understanding of Those Who Came Before, and that could be the basis of this story; the Incas trying to prevent the Templars from controlling another Temple/rare piece of Eden/other, and in the end destroying it, thus knowingly crippling and sacrificing their civilization for the rest of humanity (in their eyes)."

assassinscreed,3dvvpk,FlatTire2005,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:07:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah but why do you think gangs steal from innocents rather then other other gangs.

assassinscreed,3dvvpk,FlatTire2005,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:37:42 2015 UTC,"Easier maybe, but not heroic. Fighting other gangs seems to be a major part of the game, so stealing from them isn't much different.

The modern day used to be something special. There was always this sort of mystery to that part of the game. Now the only mysterious bits we get is when the devs still think that part of the game needs to be kept a secret until launch. As for the second question, my perfect modern day would be:    The open environment and overall immersion from AC: B The writing and storytelling from Revelations The cool side missions from AC3 The hacking mini games from AC4 and AC: Ro   Put all 4 of those together, along with a third person character of some sorts (An already established character, a user created one, etc...), I think it would turn out to be something incredible again.

assassinscreed,3duyac,MusteloGris,2,Mon Jul 20 10:49:45 2015 UTC,The problem with expecting this to be any different from Unity is that this game was certainly completely planned out and heavy into dev well before Unity's release.

Whatever Syndicates original modern story was (likely Unity 2.0) is what were getting.

Juhani is taking things personally, and the Master Templar switches between missions in the real, open-world city of Montreal, and research in Animus/Helix. We could have him investigate, interrogate (read; torture), manipulate the local criminal & political elements, go on raids with his team, and conduct assassinations. It wouldn't be against Assassins (because there are too few of them right now for any substantial targets to be common), but rather against any who stand in Abstergo's way. Perhaps a local organized crime element is proving rebellious & barbaric in its practices; of course Abstergo could annihilate them, but would rather have a Master Templar take care of things more quietly."

assassinscreed,3duu7q,doug2_O,11,Sun Jul 19 21:35:48 2015 UTC,The only reason I don't really agree with this is because the protagonists have no name. It'd be hard to track who did what without any names
assassinscreed,3duu7q,jas0660,4,Sun Jul 19 18:19:16 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll have us play a scene where the Templar one is ordered to kill the Assassin one(s). Or vice versa. This is just a random thought I had that I think would be pretty cool.
assassinscreed,3duu7q,jas0660,5,Sun Jul 19 18:36:06 2015 UTC,"I mean don't get me wrong, I think it's a great idea. But they would have to go back and give us names for everyone (which isn't that hard) before doing so.  Like saying Henry Thomas was an employee working on devils of the Caribbean who was kidnapped and almost killed by a psychotic IT worker. Then you'd have names."
assassinscreed,3duu7q,jas0660,4,Sun Jul 19 19:15:44 2015 UTC,I feel like the minimalist way to do that would be to show us a document that we hack some computer to get that has the names of the people and what they were involved with.

assassinscreed,3duu71,Bossdoka,7,Mon Jul 20 01:29:12 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm getting increasingly angry about how they're blatantly IGNORING her even if she's supposed to be a main character
assassinscreed,3duu71,1314janira,3,Sun Jul 19 20:40:43 2015 UTC,I'm probably gonna make a custom cover with both of them on it side by side before the game comes out.  Maybe...
assassinscreed,3duu71,NeoNugget,3,Mon Jul 20 00:33:00 2015 UTC,"As usual, Evie got the shaft...er...em, maybe I should rephrase that. Anyway, all sexist jokes aside, I think this is both a good and bad thing. Good because it proves Ubisoft isn't just pandering to the feminist focus groups but it's bad because it's pretty shitty that the co-protagonist only get's 1/4 of the missions, 1/3 of the cover and not be featured in the special edition cover at all. They are treating one of the game's big selling points like crap."
assassinscreed,3duu71,TheTechPoTaToCHIP,9,Sun Jul 19 19:22:55 2015 UTC,"Uh, I'd say this continual and blatant disregard for Evie shows the exact opposite: it seems like the game was supposed to be solely Jacob, they retroactively shoehorned her in as a playable character.  That makes sense with the notion that she only gets 25% of the game, it makes sense with their tacked on approach to advertising her, etc.  It feels much more like they tacked her onto the game so as to satiate feminists and frankly? That's beyond stupid. First of all, feminists want more female protagonists -- not tacked on afterthoughts. Second, it shows a huuuuge unwillingness for Ubisoft to advertise a female protagonist as if they think she won't sell. And this is plainly obvious because she's a far more interesting character and he's been there, done that. I'm sure he'll have his own differences between Ezio, Edward, Arno...but they're all the same archetype. You can have the same archetype and have them be a bit different. She sounds somewhat more unique comparatively and instead of a game with her, we're getting a game with a dude we've more or less played as.  Honestly, I have no interest in this game anymore. I was somewhat interested when rumors surfaced that there'd be a female/male dual protagonist thing at work but that quickly dwindled into absolute ""meh"" territory. No advertising for her, clear afterthought, boring rehash main main character.  They've shown me nothing that makes me want this game when there are plenty of other games im looking forward to: Fallout 4, Dishonored 2, Uncharted 4, RotTR, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Hitman, etc."
assassinscreed,3duu71,thehypotheticalnerd,2,Mon Jul 20 03:23:34 2015 UTC,Did they say she only gets 1/4 of the missions somewhere?
assassinscreed,3duu71,wibo58,4,Sun Jul 19 21:25:25 2015 UTC,I don't have the exact source but I know for a fact that they said the twins have a 25%/75% split for the missions of Evie and Jacob respectively.
assassinscreed,3duu71,TheTechPoTaToCHIP,3,Sun Jul 19 22:45:00 2015 UTC,Hm. Well alrighty.

You can just put it on for fun and I think it's a great addition. Especially with last year's Unity, the costumes were redone in stunning graphics and it was so fun getting a gang of retro assassins together with your friends, one being each previous assassin. Personally, I would love to see them return and, along with the individual customization like in Unity, for there to be more preset outfits, like in past games. I think the outfits the game designers make for you always look better and more coherent than the ones you create yourself.

assassinscreed,3dt8vo,CamaroM,2,Sun Jul 19 16:17:55 2015 UTC,Just finished ACIV last night for the first time. It's probably now my 2nd favorite AC after AC2. I felt like we got a full arc with Edward rather than ending on an anticlimatic/cynical note like with Connor. Though to be honest the ending to the modern storyline was weaksauce.
assassinscreed,3dt8vo,dangerzonepatrol101,2,Sun Jul 19 23:01:45 2015 UTC,"I agree as well.  By far my favorite story in the franchise thus far.  I'm playing Rogue now, then Unity and eventually I'll play Syndicate.  But so far EK is my favorite assassin.  I mean, he's a pirate too lol.  What's not to love?  The fact that he made a decision to join the brotherhood is what sparked it for me too.  At first I was confused about it all but, it ended up making a lot of sense.  It was very refreshing in many ways as well."

I really didn't care about Edward's story UNTIL that moment. If an ending can make someone care about something they didn't care about at all, that's a damn good ending."

I'm talking about the Bombs that kill/injure like in Revelations. Unity had Poison Gas but its not as satisfying as the Splinter Bomb in Revelations. Body Shields.

assassinscreed,3dtfit,ThePreciseClimber,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:54:30 2015 UTC,"Well, you could say the same thing about ACB & ACR, especially ACB. Why was that story content not in AC2? They had plans to have Rome as the 3rd and final major city in AC2 but then they ran out of time for 2009 release. AND they released 2 sequences from AC2 as DLC as well.  Oh, and DaVinci Disappearance was pretty vital too. Without the coordinates for the Grand Temple they would've never found it."
assassinscreed,3dtfit,zgrove,5,Sun Jul 19 11:28:36 2015 UTC,"I would argue that two fully fleshed out games with gameplay and graphical improvements with vastly more mechanics that took years to develop at $60 each have more value than a mindless platformer dlc with a simple narrative voice over that had a large effect on how one would view the events of the series and could've easily been included in the main game for an extra $15  Just because the games have the same protagonist doesn't mean that they are less valuable than other games. It's actually the norm for games to have one protagonist believe it or not. It's like saying Uncharted 2 and 3 should've been included in Uncharted 1  And Davinci Dissapearance was additive in that how they found the coordinates didn't affect the outcome of the story, but it was still cool to see for sure"

I also loved how this dlc illustrates how a POE can warp the mind of a good intentioned man. How George is devastated by his own actions at the end was amazing.   And then you get to play bocce ball with him in the regular game. Yawn."

assassinscreed,3dupog,Wdfasd,11,Sun Jul 19 17:39:20 2015 UTC,They could have easily done it by making helix rifts not limited to paris.  My ideas :-   During Templer/Mongol attack on Masyaf. Reward : Altair's outfit During Siege of Monteriggioni . Reward: Ezio's outfit During battle of Bunker Hill. Reward: Connor's outfit During the fight when Blackbeard died. Reward: Edward's outfit During the fire of lisbon/ after the trigger of precursor temple. Reward: Shay's outfit
assassinscreed,3dupog,Shouvanik,5,Sun Jul 19 18:27:40 2015 UTC,Recreations of famous levels from previous games in the Unity engine would have been amazing.

assassinscreed,3dupog,grandoz039,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:45:33 2015 UTC,I don't think it will spoil the story. We'll be still controlling arno and go through the battles to reach out to the helix portal(or whatever they call it). No story character appearance or events. They will see the places but that won't be a spoiler imo. They'll feel great if they play older games and see the locations reappearing and seeing how the story unfolds in light of those events.

assassinscreed,3dupog,haloryder,2,Sun Jul 19 19:15:51 2015 UTC,"I think Arno's and Edward's would look decent enough. Maybe also Connor's, since Jacob does look slightly bulkier than most other protagonists, though I'm not sure if it would be enough to not make the costume look weird."
assassinscreed,3dupog,Eddy_Sc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:44:33 2015 UTC,"Some of the Legacy costumes looked weird in Unity, but Ezio's, which you think would look the weirdest, actually fits in decently. IMO anyway."

assassinscreed,3dswz6,decPL,-2,Sun Jul 19 05:28:56 2015 UTC,Because that's completely anti-consumer. People enjoying platform-exclusive content are actually being happy about a majority of players getting a neutered version of a game; you have to have a pretty anti-social mindset to be happy about that.
assassinscreed,3dswz6,greg225,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:28:51 2015 UTC,Being happy that you get to play something is not the same as being happy that other people can't. I enjoyed the Aveline missions in AC4 but I'm not thrilled that Xbox players didn't get it.
assassinscreed,3dswz6,decPL,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:19:48 2015 UTC,"Ok, now I'm curious - if Ubi decided to remove the last 4 chapters from AC4 on Xbox, you'd think the same? If not - where do we draw the line?"
assassinscreed,3dswz6,greg225,0,Sun Jul 19 16:05:14 2015 UTC,"Well of course it wouldn't be the same. It's a big chunk of the story. The game is not complete without it. At least Aveline's bit is completely separate. It's a neat thing, but it lasts like half an hour you still get the complete AC4 experience without it. And to be honest I doubt these murder mysteries are going to be all that great. A lot of these platform exclusive type missions tend to be very copy-paste and not that interesting. You usually aren't missing out at all if you don't get it. The Watch Dogs exclusive missions were pretty lame, Black Flag's bonus islands were just... nothing."
assassinscreed,3dswz6,Wdfasd,0,Sun Jul 19 16:13:43 2015 UTC,Every developer has a favored console or has a business deal with a company so the best thing you can do is get the console your favorite company uses. PC is easy because they just port it and release the content a few weeks later

assassinscreed,3dswz6,Marsmar-LordofMars,2,Sun Jul 19 04:05:59 2015 UTC,The game takes place in 1868. Jack the Ripper wouldn't start his murders for at least a decade after the game takes place. Arthur Conan Doyle would be 9 years old then.
assassinscreed,3dswz6,C_12,2,Sun Jul 19 07:15:30 2015 UTC,It's been confirmed possible that we'll be seeing Arthur in the DLC (probably not in the rest of the game).

assassinscreed,3drdt4,Aftermath1231,12,Sat Jul 18 19:05:47 2015 UTC,"Finally, my knowledge of literary classics is useful! So, context for the Aeneid, the story from upon which this song is based. There's this Trojan guy Aeneas who fought in the Trojan War. When Troy got burned, Aeneas was told by Venus that he was prophesied to go to Italy and his descendants would later found Rome. So he does a mini-Odyssey that takes him to Carthage, where he meets the queen Dido. He stays there for a year, and eventually the gods tell Aeneas that he really needs to get a move on and find Italy (a place he knew nothing about, not even where it was). This means he had to leave Dido. So he did, but she got really miffed by this. Dido did a lot of screaming and then killed herself by jumping on a burning pyre and stabbing herself.      Now, what on earth does this mean for our Assassins? Well, we can't equate Aeneas and Dido to Jacob and Evie because the romantic aspect doesn't fit, and I don't think we can even equate either Jacob or Evie to either Aeneas or Dido on an individual level, because from what we know, their character traits are very different. Aeneas does what he is told, doesn't stand up for himself, and is not especially charismatic or heroic, where as Jacob is the epitome of British charisma and stereotypical heroism. Dido is lustful, falling in love with Aeneas after she promised herself that she wouldn't fall in love after her first husband died, whereas Evie seems far too disciplined to be so lustful to fall for Aeneas and careless to commit suicide after he leaves.    So, returning to the question at hand, why on earth is Dido's lament here at all? Well, let's look at the broader themes of the Aeneid, and do some role reversal. While Jacob and Aeneas do not share character traits, they engage in similar actions. Assuming we're going along with the idea that something tragic happened to Jacob and Evie's home, this could parallel Troy's destruction, and set our heroes off to London (or Italy, in the Aeneid) to go about empire building. Aeneas (Jacob) takes his band of Trojans (Rooks) to the new world of Italy (London) to fight the indigenous Latin people (Templars) and lay the groundwork for the future of Rome (Assassin control of London) while making sacrifices along the way (the big one was Dido). It's a story of ""brave new world"" meets with ""what is the cost of empire"". So, let's run with the second key theme in the Aeneid, the cost of empire. This fits with both the British Empire and the Assassin Empire, if we're willing to make that stretch. Marc-Alexis has said that if you controlled London you controlled the world, so Jacob is fighting for an empire to control the world just like Aeneas was. So we know there will be sacrifices. A common request/theory for a key story conflict is that a rift will appear between Jacob and Evie and their different goals/ideologies. We know Jacob doesn't care much for the creed and just wants to take over London. We also know that Evie cares very much for the creed, and her goal is likely more focused on upholding the creed and retaining ideological purity than simply taking power, on the basis that if Jacob takes power over London at the cost of compromising the creed, what was the point of even fighting the fight at all?    Here's where I think the story is going, and here's where Dido'd lament really comes into play. Dido laments when she hears that Aeneas left her to go fulfill his destiny and get his empire. What if Dido is not an analog for Evie, but Evie and Jacob? What I mean is that what if, in both assassin's very different quests (J: get an empire, E: protect the assassin's creed) they both abandon each other, go their own way, and fight the fight alone. That would leave each of them in a state to lament the loss of their sibling, their other half. In this case, the cost of each of their goals is that they alienate each other from the thing that matters most: family. There's a reason Ubisoft has been pushing that theme of joining the family so hard. It's not just about the Rooks, it's about Jacob and Evie.    In conclusion, I think that, for the reasons listed above, comparing what we know about ACS and what we've learned from reading the Aeneid, we can make the guess that the key conflict in the story will involve a rift between Jacob and Evie on philosophical/political grounds that leaves both feeling alone without the other."

assassinscreed,3drdt4,C_12,3,Sat Jul 18 18:51:26 2015 UTC,"The text, and the Purcell opera, allude to the Aeneid, the Roman legend of the Trojan warrior Aeneas, travelling to Italy from the betrayed and fallen Troy in order to settle there and secure his son Ascanius's lineage. Their ship is blown off course from Sicily, and they land on the shore of North Africa, in Carthage, a town newly settled by refugees from Tyre. Aeneas falls in love with their queen, Dido, but dutifully departs for Italy leaving her. Distraught at his betrayal, she orders a pyre to be built and set ablaze so that Aeneas will see from his ship that she has killed herself. She sings the lament before stabbing herself as Aeneas sails on.   Damn, this is the deep insight I loved AC for."

In ACR&3 even cutscene music was great while 2&B mostly reused the ambient themes.

assassinscreed,3dryxg,FlatTire2005,4,Sat Jul 18 22:29:49 2015 UTC,"While I didnt hate game (I think its great games) ,  story wasnt much focused on assassins most time, but on revolution, most of missions I remember do something with that revolution war, and I had feeling that it was made to apeal to people which learned about it in schools (I'm not American). Lots of ""famous"" people I never saw, and not enought of interesting characters. And game had lots of side stuff, most was fun, like frontier mysteries or homestead missions, but after spending 5 hours total in tunnels to get 100% and unable to find last one atleast 30 min was annoying. Plus running around frontier to reveal whole map, or finding one beaver which lives only in 1 place of location which I had to Google after another 30 min of running. It took focus from story.  And parkour in cities wasn't much fun. I also saw spoiler that Haytam is templar, so even without watching trailers before playing game, I knew that I'm just waitng for game to really start (I liked Haytam , but it was BIT long prologue ). And that new controls were so annoying on Pc but I didn't want to switch to gamepad because of aiming, I loved old ones, and saw no fault on the + you couldn't run without freerun on, so you could accidentally climb on random wall  But liberating fortrests 100% stealth, no kill except captain was great fun, it was perfectly designed. Or before mentioned frontier mysteries and homestad missions. I even liked naval battles which most people didnt. I also enjoyed moder day missions and speech with TWCB about 6 ways how they tried to save world.

assassinscreed,3dryxg,EasyOAuditorium,4,Sun Jul 19 00:42:01 2015 UTC,"IMO, Unity's larger crowds affects the gameplay, as you can move around bits of the city while blended, while crowd size in previous games was small in comparison, while reduced the usefulness of blending in a crowd.  Also, I'm not sure by what you mean by ""everything became more contextual"", as Unity gives the player the most control of all AC games to date. You can crouch on demand, instead of the contextual crouching you'd get from AC3's foliage, and you have an enter/exit cover button, unlike AC3's contextual corner cover. Unity also allows you to freerun up, down, or on the same level, while freerunning in AC3 was just holding the sprint button and hoping Connor doesn't climb a wall when you're running between buildings."

I don't typically like horror games at all but I went into that game and it didn't even matter, I was just so entranced. Two play-throughs in two weeks, but it probably would have been less time if I didn't take a couple days to let the ending sink in. Shadow of Mordor had a great photo mode too. I got an amazing pic of Talion diving over a campfire, close up on his face, and it might be my favorite screenshot ever. I still have to check out the other games though.  Tbh photo mode should be standard in games at this point. It's a pretty simple feature that adds a lot of enjoyment, and a lot of replay value in case you want to redo the story and get some of the best screenshots you missed. Using those pics as a theme would be pretty great, too."

assassinscreed,3dpz05,ya_dingus1,2,Sat Jul 18 09:55:43 2015 UTC,Maybe they had to change way the rope launcher it works. If you remember the main reason for the rope launcher was for getting across wide city streets. Well you can't exactly grapple your rope onto a thing above you if you're on top of buildings and you're trying to swing across a wide street. Now we have only seen the rope launcher in a train station once but it's possible Ubisoft will reveal later if we can use it to swing across

In Uncharted you follow a more or less linear path, so the devs can easily implement it as a scripted event. In the same way AC has actually done things like this in some linear missions. In an open world there are just too many variables, like possible approaches, to take into account. But maybe in a few years time (next gen?) they can."

assassinscreed,3docx7,Smugjester,-2,Sat Jul 18 01:12:28 2015 UTC,Yes but it's not the problem of processing power it's a problem of knowledge of coding and the space taken up by the code that in future years will be able to be optimized and shrunken
assassinscreed,3docx7,Devoff,11,Sat Jul 18 03:48:02 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of your landing or the weight of you grabbing onto a wall would do some small environmental damage.

I wouldn't want the roof falling from under me all the time, though. It'd stay cool and surprising if it happened every now and then. Or maybe it would only happen on weaker buildings in the poor parts of a city. I wouldn't mind something like this being added at all as long as it's not overused."
assassinscreed,3docx7,Zero--Regen,11,Fri Jul 17 23:21:55 2015 UTC,"It would be immersive, sure. But Immersion doesn't always equal fun, I figure it would get annoying rather quickly even if it rarely happens. It would totally disrupt the flow of the parkour and make exploring a pain in the ass. I would actaully love it if an assassin actually did freeruning (not parkour that the series keeps calling free running) I would rather it flow better, even add some flips and spins that would really make it look cool. Anyway, I think the parkour in Unity is fine as it is, just fix some of the bugs and it would be perfect."

assassinscreed,3docx7,Hapa_Hombre,5,Fri Jul 17 22:31:52 2015 UTC,That was one of the things loved about some of the separate zones in some of the AC games. You'd be climbing through a destroyed ship or building and some beam would give way. Fire would cause a pathway to close suddenly. Implementing that into open world events would be tricky but it'd sure be awesome to experience.
assassinscreed,3docx7,boblo1121,4,Sat Jul 18 00:12:01 2015 UTC,"I remember that stuff in tomb raider and it got annoying as hell. It wasn't cool, it wasn't scary. It was predictable. And repetitive. Having that happen over and over would just annoy most people. When playing tomb raider, there were all those ""close calls"", like making a huge jump from a crumbling bridge or something, and the next time something like that was about to happen, all I could think was ""oh no! What ever could happen?! Is this the end of Lara crofts story?!? How will she ever make it out of this one!?"" (Extremely sarcastic of course). It could be cool, but most likely not."

It's not that easy at all especially when the roof is slanted (I've been on one). It is nearly impossible. I mean sure, they are well trained, but they are still going to have their slips when being chased and running at high speeds. It would make sense if they forced you to go to the top flat part. Maybe if you ran on a sloped roof, they would slip (like you said) and you'd have to press the right buttons to hold on in time."
assassinscreed,3docx7,ThePreciseClimber,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:45:47 2015 UTC,"All that brick-breaking and camera shaking works really well when it's part of a scripted, cinematic sequence. What it does is it adds tension. Like maybe you're being chased, or you're on a really tall structure, and something breaks- that half second of 'Oh shit, I'm about to fall!' can be very suspenseful. In fact, AC games do this! I was playing AC4 the other day, and in an early sequence, he's climbing a mayan structure and a rope bridge gives out.  See, they use that technique, but only when it's appropriate. If you were just casually climbing a building, something that happens all the time and is a major part of the AC gameplay, and a brick breaks or you slip? That's not suspenseful, it's just a frustrating, unwelcome interruption to the pacing of freeclimbing.   But here's a similar counter-proposal. I think that trees and wildlife should react realistically to characters' weight. It feels really awkward in AC3/4/Ro to step on a branch and have it remain completely still. A normal branch should buckle under the mass of a human being. When you swing on a vine, the vine should move a little bit. And so on and so forth."

Fog could help with stealth at the expense of reduced eagle vision, rain and wind could affect jumping and running, ice affecting climbing.

Part of the literature that we read in school portrays native Brazilian culture, especially the Tupi tribe. In those books, the difference in culture between the colonials and the natives are extensively illustrated.   I mention this, because some of the things that where considered naive of Connor, reminds me a lot of the Tupi culture. I understand that Tupi and Mohawks are not the same. However, I conjecture that some of the things that came out as naive could potentially be an illustration of cultural, ideology and Bali differences. If that was indeed done deliberately (which I suspect it was), I'd consider a brilliant aspect of AC3 and its main character.   I'd definitely be excited about another game or DLC featuring Connor."
assassinscreed,3dn9x6,ecologynerd,11,Fri Jul 17 23:51:53 2015 UTC,"i can see him coming back for a dlc like they did for adewale.  i don't think he'll get another full game, since his character was not well liked on release.  i personally liked him, but ezio auditore was a very hard act to follow"
assassinscreed,3dn9x6,borgsaa,20,Fri Jul 17 20:24:43 2015 UTC,"Assassin's Creed 3 had a very mixed reception, and Connor was part of the reason why. Sure he has a fanbase, but he was generally not well liked. There's just little to no incentive to bring him back, especially after 3 years."
assassinscreed,3dn9x6,NeoNugget,12,Fri Jul 17 19:26:36 2015 UTC,You kidding? The longer they wait the more people will love seeing him back. Just look at Altair and Revelations. His missions were damn short but he was still a big selling point in the game.
assassinscreed,3dn9x6,RufusStJames,13,Fri Jul 17 19:54:22 2015 UTC,"Altair was not as ill-received as Connor. There are a vocal minority that liked Connor, but I believe the general reception was negative. They'll bring back Arno before they bring back Connor at this point."
assassinscreed,3dn9x6,borgsaa,3,Fri Jul 17 21:18:27 2015 UTC,"The reason why they have been scaling back modern day, and not sticking with one character for more than one game, is to make the series more accessible for new comers. Bringing back a divisive character like Connor after so many games, is going to alienate people who want to dive into the series without getting confused. Alta√Ør was also better received than Connor. Look outside of this sub and you'll be hard pressed to find other adjectives being used for Connor than ""boring"", unfortunately."
assassinscreed,3dn9x6,BluetoothMcGee,3,Fri Jul 17 20:04:44 2015 UTC,Which is odd considering that AC3 is to date the best selling title in the series.
assassinscreed,3dn9x6,borgsaa,3,Sat Jul 18 00:58:00 2015 UTC,But it also explains why AC4's pre orders were lower.
assassinscreed,3dn9x6,cbfw86,9,Sat Jul 18 01:00:21 2015 UTC,"Connor wasn't the reason why. The flagrant disregard for earlier AC canon was part of it (Washington's POE and historical accuracy of being a Templar being reduced to a spin off DLC and an alliance with the Assassins, to say nothing of the AMERICA, FUCK YEAH-ness of it all), and also the way they stuck two fingers up at longtime fans by shitting in Desmond's mouth to keep the money spinner spinning was also part of it.  Connor wasn't a big part of the cynicism."
assassinscreed,3dn9x6,borgsaa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:45:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe not amongst fans, but the broader audience and reviewers disliked him."
assassinscreed,3dn9x6,ThePreciseClimber,2,Fri Jul 17 21:47:39 2015 UTC,"It took them 4 years to properly get back to Altair (I don't count the half-assed DS/PSP games) and they only had 2 established ancestors back then with unfinished stories. Now we have 4 (Connor, Aveline, Shay, Arno) which may become 6 soon after Syndicate, so it may take them even longer to get back to Connor.  However, after the Aveline DLC in AC4, I don't think they'll just abandon him. He may not get a main game again (the same way no protagonist is gonna get more than one game now) but surely they'll finish his story in one way or another. A short film, a comic book, a novel - there's plenty of possibilities."
assassinscreed,3dn9x6,FearTheBeard513,3,Fri Jul 17 18:22:37 2015 UTC,What Aveline DLC was there in AC4?
assassinscreed,3dn9x6,AlexxJoshee,4,Sat Jul 18 03:01:43 2015 UTC,There was a 1 hour long DLC which was PlayStation exclusive if I remember correctly.

They should honestly just stick to their guns and tell a multi-game story again with the same characters. Their story is all over the place right now when it needs to be cohesive
assassinscreed,3dn9x6,ya_dingus1,3,Sun Jul 19 06:15:39 2015 UTC,maybe they'll try to bring back connor in a new game at a later time when the series hits rock bottom to surprise everyone to make them come back to it

I also think that this character had potential to be much more interesting later on in life. I like to think that some of the stoicness and naivete that made his character so frustrating and unlikable to me would've gone away over time. It's feasible that more time spent in the company of people who are outgoing and mature would allow him to shed his reservedness and immaturity. I'd be up for Connor getting closure in the form of a comic, short film, or side game, but I still rather dislike him, so I'd prefer to roll the dice on a new protagonist when it comes to the main game series."

assassinscreed,3dmzng,zgrove,20,Fri Jul 17 19:46:26 2015 UTC,it'll be the same. think of the last time a perceived flaw in the alpha/e3 presentation was corrected... never.  the only time the e3 build differed from the game was when features were removed (think ac:iv black flag's contextual blend animations)  ofc i might be proven wrong but i'm expecting the clunky combat to stay
assassinscreed,3dmzng,triskelio,8,Fri Jul 17 19:52:34 2015 UTC,"I would like to give Ubi the benefit of the doubt. But I saw Unity 2 months before it launched,  behind closed doors.

They're likely unfinished animations, and this demo is an alpha, they say it multiple times, I don't care if you think it looks too polished to be an alpha, that's a good thing. It's how they presented it, and I'm gonna take their word if there's literally no evidence besides personal opinion against it. Wait till the fucking game is out before you make your judgements, because in the end that's what matters, not some demo that most people can't even play."
assassinscreed,3dmzng,Aaron0535,2,Sat Jul 18 03:43:10 2015 UTC,"Every gameplay trailer says its an alpha when its any game. It's so they have an excuse so if anything looks bad to them. Alphas would be missing textures, sound glitches galore, bugs everywhere, animations not even in yet, and possibly whole parts of the world missing. It's not alpha. And I only downvoted your first comment. Because it was wrong. The rest I haven't touched. Maybe that says something about your side of the argument."

I'm still gonna stick with alpha because you have literally only given conjecture for ""proof"" that it's not.  Either way it's an early build, and had sound problems that they addressed. I'm saying don't judge the whole game by a demo, period. And I don't know how you can say my first comment was wrong with absolutely no proof in your favor.  I can objectively say without a shred of doubt that they said alpha in the video which this thread is about, and the distinction between alpha and beta is so arbitrary that it's a useless argument that you seem absolutely sure about.  The level of arrogance you have to think that you're undoubtedly right with absolutely no credentials or knowledge of the development of the game is astounding I'm going by the word of the guy who has insight of the inner workings of the studio, not by some randy on the Internet who wants to hate on an unfinished game based on a privately released demo."

assassinscreed,3dmzng,zgrove,5,Fri Jul 17 19:08:56 2015 UTC,Or maybe it's that it looks bad and clunky. And there looks to be a total of 6 animations when fighting.
assassinscreed,3dmzng,borgsaa,-2,Fri Jul 17 18:27:10 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing since a lot of the combat will be revolving around hand to hand they're actually gonna have a lot more extensive and detailed animations and sounds to accompany, and the current combat is a placeholder for the ALPHA demo.

assassinscreed,3dmzng,zgrove,6,Fri Jul 17 20:34:49 2015 UTC,33% of their development time   it's been in development for more than a year.

assassinscreed,3dmzng,zgrove,4,Fri Jul 17 22:17:40 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying don't judge a game that's not even out yet   Why? There hasn't been a single AC game that was improved from its E3 demos. Hell, they're usually dialed back i.e. Black Flag's blend animations and Unity's descent from Notre Dame."
assassinscreed,3dmzng,borgsaa,-2,Sat Jul 18 01:09:31 2015 UTC,"Fine. Don't buy the game based on this E3 demo, I don't really care, but you'll be missing out if you use this as an indicator for what the game is like. It could be a piece of shit, or it could be great. We have no clue.  Unity is like the AC3 of this console. It was a new engine that had a lot of bugs. They've refined their skills, took note of shortcomings with the last game, and I'm hoping that the new game is good.  That doesn't mean that I'm preordering it. It means that I have no opinion on it, and won't until it comes out. And any logical person would do the same. To write off the game because combat looks ""flaccid"" in a demo, and there's no way it'll be any different in the final release is ludicrous.  Besides, the fist fighting not having any weight is largely in part to the audio in game that wasn't working. And the stuttering in the animation is probably half finished combat animations that can be finished in 4 months if they aren't already complete. If you don't think the devs are finalizing the game until the last minute you're kidding yourself. Hell, I probably won't get the game until after the first major patch, which is when games really are finished in the current market"
assassinscreed,3dmzng,zgrove,3,Sat Jul 18 01:47:43 2015 UTC,"They've refined their skills, took note of shortcomings with the last game   If you can tell that this is the case based on what we've seen, it makes just as much sense that a person can tell that the combat is off. Look back at literally any AC demo from 2 and onward. What we see is what we get. Just look at the combat segment from AC3's E3 demo.   If you don't think the devs are finalizing the game until the last minute you're kidding yourself.    Of course they are, but you can't ""fix"" a combat system in three months, or add 20 new animations. If you think they have revolutionized the combat system since E3, you are kidding yourself. If the combat was so unfinished they wouldn't have shown it off to the extent that they have. AC games have never had great combat, this just looks like a new kind of ""off"""
assassinscreed,3dmzng,borgsaa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:17:36 2015 UTC,"You're twisting my words. I never said they were revolutionizing the combat. I said the animations might not be as stutters, there might be a few more, and there almost definitely will be sound. As for the first part, that was just my best guess and by no means should be taken as fact. I'm as uninformed as you, but I'm not gonna try to hide it."
assassinscreed,3dmzng,TheTechPoTaToCHIP,2,Sat Jul 18 10:33:20 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the audio will be better, but the animations are what they are, as has been the case with every other AC game. I'm not writing it off because of the combat. I dismissed it as soon as it was announced, because I'm not going to support a publisher that enforces a post review embargo. Everything I've seen has just made me more secure about my decision."

I only did two of the diving stuff, since it felt a bit like a water level hell of gaming. So for me I'm cool with a shorter AC game. I'm excited to start Rouge now."

The framerate can be iffy at times and I'm seeing some pop-in and slow loading. Also the Dualshock 4 is just more comfortable for games like this. The game itself though seems alright. I like the environments. AC3 and 4 are my favourites so it's nice to get a mix."

assassinscreed,3dnh3i,TheLostPotato,3,Sat Jul 18 03:41:41 2015 UTC,They could wear like sleeveless or thin hoodies with the sleeves rolled up and the hood down until necessary like in Black Flag  Edit: they could occasionally use an arm sling to conceal the hidden blade

If was a girl, whatever she wanted to wear, as long as it wasn't too revealing and didn't hinder movement.

I do realise the potential that can and has been reaped by the series by focusing on them.  It's just that I wish they would further the modern day Assassins vs Templars conflict instead of keeping it in the sidelines. A battle of ideologies framed in our time, (or even progressing with Juno, which I agree a MacGuffin driven plot could propel forward) as opposed to a race of who can get to something first, which frankly, they've already done in AC1, ACB, Black Flag, Unity and now Syndicate.

Its stable with no slowdown (at least on Xbox One), but there is some texture popping in crowds every so often, but nothing too major - the crowds are really large scale, so I guess its to be somewhat expected. FPS locked at 30 I believe, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  In short - go for it! The game works fine, and co-op is fun with a friend. Occasionally a little laggy, but again, nothing too major. Also, due to the issues it had, we got the DLC for free, and that DLC is a pretty damn good one as well - Dead Kings. Also, Unity would be cheap now as well, can probably pick it up for ¬£10/$15ish."

assassinscreed,3djxb7,cday969,11,Fri Jul 17 17:03:05 2015 UTC,Maybe they could do like the weight system in RPG's where each item has a weight and it affects freerunning. Then the restrictions on freerunning are laid out in like a chart if you're carrying this much movement is slowed by x% and jump height reduced by x% until you are over-encumbered and can just fast walk with no freerunning. There could be gear changing stations all over the cities instead of in the menu because IMO that was awful.

assassinscreed,3djxb7,_LifeIsAbsurd,13,Fri Jul 17 00:27:52 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of having a wide variety of weapons, but having limited access to them. That is, if it's done right. Don't force me to use a weapon I don't want or keep me from using a weapon I want, but make me choose my weapons and gear before each mission.  For example, I assume future games will continue to have Assassin dens/hideouts/some sort of base of operations. Make it so that you get your assignments from this hideout, and know the general idea behind the mission - kill a target in a populated area in a highly visible fashion, sneak into and out of a heavily guarded fort to kill the general without any witnesses, kill so and so by any means necessary, etc. Add an armory to the hideout. I don't mean just tack up the weapons you've unlocked on the wall - make it a real armory. If you want to use a certain weapon for a mission, you have to physically travel to the armory, put the weapon you were using in the rack, and select your new weapon. Same for armor. If you want to switch your gear and weapons, you'll have to revisit the hideout. If you're getting your ass kicked, you'll have to either restart the mission with different gear, or use strategy and skill to extract yourself from the situation. No opening a menu and having your armor magically switch from Arno's tailored coat to Legendary medieval armor. Make us prepare for the assassination at hand."

What you're suggesting is the gameplay mechanics to a logical sequel of AC1. This is not to say that every AC but the first one sucked lol or that AC2 had bad ideas (no one could claim that). Your ideas have me wanting to look forward to seeing them in a future AC, but honestly, that seems futile. We are not going to get such mechanics."

assassinscreed,3djxb7,toomanyhorses,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:31:01 2015 UTC,I loved using the muskets
assassinscreed,3djxb7,saruphantom,11,Fri Jul 17 18:54:50 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea, you carry 4 weapons at a time like in AC1. One of those weapons is always the hidden blade. The other 3 slots are categorized.    Main/mid to close range (unconcealed) Secondary/close range (concealed) Ranged (variable concealment)    Your main weapon would be a sword, axe, rifle, spear, whatever. That's your main weapon for when the heat comes down on you. But it's large and visible. You walk into certain areas and the guards will watch you much more closely (and attack if you draw it). In restricted areas the guards will kick you out, or attack you on sight. You have to rely on stealth to get past them with it, leave the main weapon home, or try to fight your way through.   The secondary weapon could be a dagger, brass knuckles, second hidden blade, baton, or other concealable weapon. You can carry this wherever. Certain restricted zones could have guards search you before you enter and they may find this weapon. But more often than not, you can carry this weapon without drawing attention. It's also weaker than your main weapon, but it's faster.  Then ranged could be a bow, a pistol, blowpipe, etc. A choice of ranged weapon. The visibility for these is assigned depending on the weapon, and some are stealthy forms of attack while others are not.   You would also get a choice of one tool that has limited uses. It could be a smoke bomb, money bomb, fireworks, etc. You only get one choice, and it can run out.   Before certain missions you could choose your ""load out"" for how you best think the situation might be handled. You can use whatever means and weapon combination you like, but it may be more difficult depending on what weapons you choose. Sometimes charging in guns blazing and sword swinging is fine, but other times you will get mobbed by 20 guys and will probably die. Whilst free roaming the city/area your ""load out"" is mostly ignored by the populace and can be changed at certain locations (or maybe do it like in Unity)  This way could combine the systems of Unity (the choices) and AC1 (the number restricted) mostly. It also adds some realism with weapon notoriety. You can't walk down the street in certain time periods while having a sword strapped to your hip, while in other places or times it may be perfectly acceptable. The system gives the player a way to control difficulty to some extent, and makes them also be wary in their choices and consider the stealthy approach without forcing them.  Whew, that was a lot."
assassinscreed,3djxb7,tranerekk,2,Fri Jul 17 10:06:29 2015 UTC,Shit. Why aren't you in charge of the next AC? I would play the everliving fuck out of a game like this.
assassinscreed,3djxb7,SparkedSynapse,8,Sat Jul 18 04:22:50 2015 UTC,"Only weapons that can be concealed should be in the game. It makes no sense that the assassin are walking death machine full of equipment. It destroy any aspect of blending in or stealth from AC1. O look this guy has a crossbow and swords or is arm to the teeth with pistol and rifle. He's totally not going to kill us. i didn't use most thing from ac 2 and onward. weapons should be breakable. the assassin shouldn't be able to sustain long term combat unless he's equip to do so. The hidden blade should be breakable like in the trailer for ac Revelation. or else i'm just use that as the default weapon and not buy anything else.  Another thing is that if the Templar are almost always better funded and organized. It makes no sense that they don't have walking reapers killing every assassin they meet. so if the assassin are the underdog they can't have all these things until they take territory from the Templar and as a result we should be able to see Templar agents becoming poorer equipped or more likely to give up and surrender. All territory should have the same level enemy. They should all be the same and you work skills way up. two human equipped with the same gear shouldn't have two different health meter because one's in a ""lower"" level area and another is from a  higher level area."

I don't think I once used a smoke grenade in any game since they've been introduced, let alone all the shit Ezio could craft in ""Revelations."" I almost never used Connor's guns or Adewale's blunderbuss. It was nice to have the option, but it didn't suit my play style.  Same went for ""Watch Dogs."" It didn't take me long to get every gun in the game. What did I use? Silenced pistol, silenced submachinegun. If it didn't have a specific purpose, I never touched it.

I'd be happy with tools being gun or sone other long range weapon dependant on the period and smoke bombs.   Let's face it, Jacobs 'gimmick' is the first in a while that's actually somewhat useful. Phantom Blade was just a resin of what we already had, Connor's switchblade was aesthetic. Idk what Edwards was. Four pistols? I guess they were cool, but at the end of the day 4 shots was doable in III, it just looked cooler in IV. Or maybe the Jackdaw. Ok that was pretty useful"

assassinscreed,3djxb7,DutchConquer,3,Fri Jul 17 08:13:13 2015 UTC,"I'll say what I've said since Black Flag when we've talked about weapons.  I want more weapons. I want fewer slots to carry them with me on missions, or a benefit for going in with less equipment.  Altair was lightly equipped, and more ""Assassin"" than ""warrior"" compared to the rest of the series. Connor was, well, a walking arsenal. Arno introduces new stealth elements with the phantom blade, and Shay/Edward show how you can build on that arsenal by carrying a variety of firearms.  I want to pick, and for choices to have an influence on the game. If I choose to dual wield Assassin blades, equip a phantom blade, and carry an array of darts as my only weaponry, I'd like some massive stealth bonuses. Let me draw less attention when moving in public, and let it be easier for me to slip back into a crowd after a kill.  Or if I want to be like Connor, but with an air rifle, grenade launcher, four pistols, and the phantom blade on top of his normal weaponry, maybe there are some public areas where guards will come find me because I'm clearly armed and dangerous, you know? Like, if you're going to look like a one man war machine, let public spaces treat you as a threat. But if you want to fuck someone up, you're equipped.  Then part of missions or assassinations can be visiting Assassin hideouts/stashes and planning your gear accordingly, so you might have an option for a special rope dart kill, but too bad, you didn't bring it with you, you know? And the variety of gameplay sky rockets, and it would add some real variety to co-op if they ever do that again.  But I still have hopes they'll bring back AC3's assassin trainees, so clearly I'm crazy as for future improvements to the series, right?"
assassinscreed,3djxb7,ocyries,3,Fri Jul 17 13:03:33 2015 UTC,"I had a period where I simply would not use swords, axes or any other weapon that would look out of place if you were walking in the street today. My D-pad setup in Brotherhood and Revelations consisted of Ezio's hidden blades, the hidden gun, fists and coin throw, though I sometimes switched that out for smoke bombs. No dagger, no poison, no crossbow. If I was in a fight, I would use fists if I did not wish to kill, and the hidden blades and gun if I wanted to kick ass. Coins or smoke bombs were great for diverting attention when you wanted to be sneaky.  It's just not very Assassin-y to walk around with a bigass broadaxe or a bastard sword. I like to play a bit more stealthily, and make combat a bit more challenging, to make myself wish I didn't get into open combat to begin with.

assassinscreed,3djs54,Trevastation,37,Fri Jul 17 14:21:05 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head...   World War II: Unless the character is based on ""Mad Jack"" Churchill, the game would rely too much on shooting mechanics, which will offset the assassinations and melee combat. Plus, I'm not a fan of the lore during this time, mainly that World War II was set up by the FDR, Churchill, Mussolini, and Hitler. It makes me feel a bit weird thinking of one of, if not, the most effective American Presidents, and from what I could gather, a good person, setting up World War II with the Templars. I can see him as a Templar, but I'm not the only one who feels it a bit uncomfortable with him preplanning a war that would take millions of lives for Templar control, am I? Western: The comparisons to Red Dead Redemption would be all too similar, and that even compared to ACIII and Black Flag, the towns would feel too small to really climb and explore. Very Early Civilizations (Mesopotamia and possibly Egypt): The historical setting is fascinating and not much explored, but thinking mechanics wise, it doesn't work. Our gear would be too primitive compared to other entries (the classic handblade wouldn't even be invented yet til the Persians come in), that it would feel like a step backwards. I mean, Ubisoft could find a way, but I wouldn't be surprised if they don't do these settings because of said reasons."

You would sabotage equipment, kill high ranking officers, and cause general disruption behind the lines. Everyone focuses on how guns are not good. Who said the assassin's would want to use them. I could see them being snipers, but they don't want to draw too much attention to themselves. One problem would be where you would jump into to brace your falls. There probably won't be a haystack lying around. I know WWII might be an over used and unliked topic, but to me, there is some potential."

There are two trenches, 100 feet apart or so, it is foggy and muddy and rainy. the men on both sides are tired, sick, underfed, and just want to be home. Neither sides are expecting anything. Then, out of the fog is like 3 assassins running straight for the other side. (Think the AC3 trailer on bunkerhill?) The assassins through smoke bombs into the trench and jump over, then keep runing, doging bullets, and stabing people periodically. They reach the officers and grab them. then stab them, grab some documents and keep on running.   In my mind it could be fucking awesome. It would need a ton of stealth and combat avoidance, reliance on terain. You couldnt be Rambo, you would have to be an assassin. Would be fucking sick."

But call it a new IP or a Tenchu reboot and I'm definitely on board.  I remember around the time AC3 was yet to be announced when some concept art/rumours were floating around about a futuristic AC game, and I would hate that.

Now, I'd really not want a closer to modern one than we currently have. I feel as though Syndicate is far enough in the timeline, a lot of recent history can be rather boring, or rather, it has been too saturated within gaming, so it wont have the sense of wonder that other time periods do.

My bet is that Japan will be the 2017 game on a new revamped engine (which will likely be buggy as all hell, such as the case with AC3 and ACU, but since it's Japan people won't complain I guess), and 2016 will be another european city, or maybe even a continuation of ACS?"

With 30 years I'm left wondering what happens in all that time. In AC3 Connor and Haytham were on a boat together for a month, did they just never talk or something? They knew each other for years but in the game it feels like they knew each other for a few weeks."
assassinscreed,3djw4q,greg225,7,Thu Jul 16 22:36:46 2015 UTC,"Eh I think they both can be handled well or handled badly but I generally prefer longer settings, gives more time for growth and development I think."
assassinscreed,3djw4q,Aftermath1231,3,Thu Jul 16 21:33:07 2015 UTC,I don't know if I would place Black Flag in the many years category because it only spans like maybe 5 years max. Whereas AC2 goes from Ezio's birth to him beating up the Pope. You see what I'm trying to say?
assassinscreed,3djw4q,OGStarkiller,2,Thu Jul 16 21:42:25 2015 UTC,"I think every AC should expand across years, as the whole point was to relive the memories of the lives of these people. Even the later ones. I would go so far as to say I would prefer we see the protagonists death at the end of each game (or at the end of each set of their games), as a form of closure. I don't like the open endings like with Connor and Arno."

AC1, Brotherhood, and Revelations all had compelling stories. I don't think I have a preferred style, but it's cool to see a game span over many years. You can really feel the weight of their journey when you see they've been pursuing their goal over so much time."

assassinscreed,3djpui,Zero--Regen,3,Fri Jul 17 01:52:50 2015 UTC,"Sadly, it's the same as one of Arno's dual air assassination animations. Hopefully Jacob has at least one of his own animations. Arno's were cool, but it'd be nice to see Jacob with one of his own that compliments his brutality."

assassinscreed,3dgv1c,mm923448,9,Thu Jul 16 15:15:46 2015 UTC,"The best modern day game was Brotherhood. There was such a great atmosphere to take a break (voluntarily, not forced) from the Animus and roam around present day Monteriggioni, under cover of darkness, with the ever present threat of Abstergo hunting for my team of specialists. The turncoat Templar (before that was groan-inducingly retconned), the computer whiz, the technical expert, I wondered what kind of adventures my little cadre would get up to in the years to come as we continued to run and fight against the superior resources of our Templar opponents. What happened instead was the two most interesting members died unceremoniously, the remaining members carried on their intrigue as damn baristas, and the ever present Abstergo threat was hastily dispatched in a throw away segment put together at the last minute, to be replaced by the new threat of what was originally introduced as a godlike entity about to wage war on the world but instead turned out to be a threat kept at bay as long as the Assassins keep up with the latest McAfee updates. Annualization killed the main Assassins Creed narrative, but sometimes I still fire up Brotherhood and brood around the rooftops of Monteriggioni and imagine what could have been."

assassinscreed,3dhp2n,Zero--Regen,30,Thu Jul 16 10:41:39 2015 UTC,"I liked assassins creed when each game would have its own assassin story which would be interesting on its own but would be complemented with the modern day story part.      I liked it when I felt I was following the assassin's footsteps for a reason. Each assassin story would lead to a progression in the modern day story. If they had continued this, and the real life part was interesting, I would have no problem with annual releases.     Instead, with the turn that assassins creed 4 and unity took in the modern day parts, the style of the modern day makes each game feel like more of a grab for money as opposed to a piece of art or an interesting tale."
assassinscreed,3dhp2n,Namyts,12,Thu Jul 16 13:05:15 2015 UTC,"I would feel better about if it was ""just"" annual, but it's not anymore. Last year they put out two games, and this year an episodic series and a full game. I don't think it's necessarily hurting the quality of the games, but I'm just not interested in playing extremely similar games year after year anymore. If Syndicate isn't balls to the walls awesome, I'm completely done with this franchise going forward. I'll just replay the older games every now and then."
assassinscreed,3dhp2n,borgsaa,8,Thu Jul 16 12:03:28 2015 UTC,"It doesn't need to be. The best part to me was the lore and story arch of Desmond. Now they don't know where the series should go and it's frustrating. Assassin's Creed is not like Call of Duty where the context of the world changes every game. There was a carefully crafted idea that is butchered because of an annual release. Assassin's Creed doesn't deserve an annual release, it deserves better care."
assassinscreed,3dhp2n,alain471,7,Thu Jul 16 16:22:48 2015 UTC,"AC is one of the few games i really look forward to. So I don't mind it being annual at all, however I would love it if they took a year off and come back with a bang. I have a love-hate thing with it being annual. On one hand it gives me more AC every year which i really welcome, on the other hand the development becomes rushed and the product usually may not shine to its full potential."
assassinscreed,3dhp2n,TysonEX,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:31:15 2015 UTC,"Well said.  The fact is I think AC manages to bring a surprising amount of change year-to-year (because these games are staggered on 3-4 year dev cycles), but I'm beginning to worry it's not enough.  There are enough franchises on 4-6 year cycles (GTA, Fallout, etc.) that it seems at least one is coming out every year or every other year that AC doesn't stand up to quite as well.  But on a gap year, boy is a new AC game something to look forward to."
assassinscreed,3dhp2n,TheVangu4rd,7,Thu Jul 16 20:01:06 2015 UTC,"I guess Syndicate will be the telling factor for me. If it's anything like Unity when it first came out then I'm definitely gonna start supporting a move away from annual releases to give them more time to perfect the game. However, if it goes well then I'm of the same mind as you. I too think they change enough to keep it fresh to release them every year."
assassinscreed,3dhp2n,sharkmdb,5,Thu Jul 16 10:48:32 2015 UTC,"Coming into the series late, I never had a problem with annual releases; I binged on all the ACs before AC4 over a nice period of time.  However, with AC4, Rogue and Unity, it's become apparent that no matter the dev time, the yearly release schedule has resulted in the meta story getting weaker and weaker, eventually being consigned to other media such as the internet. So annual releases, aka greed, is resulting in the series' death knell for me."
assassinscreed,3dhp2n,ice74205,5,Thu Jul 16 15:21:58 2015 UTC,"ATM I have no interest in the series at all. This doesn't even have something to do with Unity. It's just I played it too many times. Every year. There is no real story progression outside the memories, so there isn't even e great outer plot, which could keep me interested.   I'm passing the new one (don't even know its name) and probably the next one. Maybe I'll never play one again. I'm just tired of it."
assassinscreed,3dhp2n,Moral4postel,4,Thu Jul 16 17:17:14 2015 UTC,"The rate of release for me is irrelevant.  The issue I have is that the games are becoming less fun, more grindy and the modern-day story had seemingly been sidelined due to negative reviews.   Add boring protagonists (also Watchdogs) and ""realistic"" fighting (too hard and not enjoyable for me), one savegame only, no game-sharing on PC, and you're left with some hard-to-love experiences.  And the English accents in Unity for Arno and Elise were pretty bad. Not quite Dick Van Dyke, but surprisingly close in parts.  And don't get me started on framerates!"
assassinscreed,3dhp2n,ac007,3,Thu Jul 16 19:51:43 2015 UTC,"I like and dislike it.   Without the series being annualized I don't think that we would have gotten the fun and experimental Black Flag. I also selfishly like having a new AC game to play every year. However, the quality has been slowly slipping the longer the schedule has been in place. Unity was not further delayed because they didn't want to postpone Syndicate and other future AC games.  I think it would be better for the series if Ubisoft took a break and retooled the game and came up with a really good story. What a difference in news from ""There's yet another AC game coming out this year"" to ""What, no new AC game this year?!"""
assassinscreed,3dhp2n,TheCliffhangers,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:20:26 2015 UTC,"Since the series was annualized iv'e always said i'd wait 2 years for a new game. Hell, i'd wait 3, but i'd need something adding to the lore over the wait. A comic can do that or even a novel. It would be pretty exciting seeing them not release a game one year, because you'd know they're working on something giant if that happened."
assassinscreed,3dhp2n,Serapius,3,Thu Jul 16 19:36:53 2015 UTC,"I think it is hurting the series overall. I love AC games and I will probably buy them for as long as they put them out, but where is the story going? We haven't had much progress since AC3.  AC1, AC2, ACB, and AC3 were pretty important to the modern story. They flowed and kept us going. But with Desmond, they had a defined arc and had an idea of where to go and what to do. Now it feels like they're just spinning their wheels until they can figure out the next big step in the story (if there even is one).  Revelations, AC4, Rogue, and Unity all seemed like just filler. They fluff up the universe with a few new details and elements, but all in all they aren't making any kind of real movement. Don't get me wrong, I loved those games, and I'm ok with Ubisoft releasing a few games here or there that primarily serve to only fill in gaps in the series like these games. But they need to have more forward momentum in order to push this series in the right direction. They need a game plan, and if that requires taking a few years off and not releasing any AC games in order to properly iron out the detail and line everything up, then so be it."
assassinscreed,3dhp2n,jamster4400,6,Thu Jul 16 16:32:22 2015 UTC,"I think the annual releases are way too fast, look at the amazing games like: GTA, The Witcher, Fallout. If as much care was put into assassins creed as some devs put into their games it would make it a much more loveable franchise. Also this will mean it is a lot less buggy upon release."
assassinscreed,3dhp2n,Hka9,3,Thu Jul 16 11:22:11 2015 UTC,"I used to be a huge fan of the franchise (I have every collector's edition so far, figures, books, comics, ...) but the yearly releases have been burning me out for a while now and with Unity I think I finally hit the breaking point. I'm not hyped about Syndicates like at all, nothing about it interests me even though I've wanted Victorian London as a setting and a female protagonist for a while now... it just looks like more of the same to me and I'm getting a bit sick of it.  So Syndicates will be the first AC I skip or at least won't buy on release, I'll watch a LP for the story but even that has been losing my interest. I'll only buy it if it's really, really good."
assassinscreed,3dhp2n,ya_dingus1,3,Thu Jul 16 12:02:54 2015 UTC,i can't get enough of it. I'll buy everyone as long as their fun. When i play an AC game that i don't enjoy then maybe thats when i feel they should take a break

assassinscreed,3dhp2n,KillRockNRoll,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:36:38 2015 UTC,"I've been a fan since the first game. The original Assassin's Creed was one of the very first games I got for that generation of consoles. It was certainly flawed, but it blew me away. A few years later, AC2 came out and I was again blown away. They had polished the core mechanics and made great improvements. Every little nitpick I had about AC1 was worked on! AC2 was one of the best games I'd ever played at the time. I adored everything about it. It was a game that I spent hours on at a time. I had to do / see everything. And the story was so well written! I remember being so excited to see where the series would go when the next installment was released (which I assumed would take several years)  Then Brotherhood was announced. And I believe they also announced that Assassin's Creed was going to be an annual franchise with the Brotherhood reveal.  I remember my heart sinking. The series that I had fallen in love with was going to essentially become the open world equivent of Call Of Duty.   I remember thinking ""well, there goes the quality of the Assassin's Creed series."" And, in my opinion, my worries were correct.   Brotherhood seemed like a cash in. I felt like Ubisoft was cashing in on the huge success of AC2 by essentially making AC2.5. I gave them the benefit of the doubt but I was severely disappointed. Revelations was even worse. They were clearly bullshitting around with the modern day story that seemed to be so well written in the first two games.   My main fears were that the games would be un polished with new features not really being given proper development. Revelations was the perfect example. The hookblade? Meh. The tower defense? Terrible. The very existence of Brotherhood and Revelations seemed to weaken the ending of AC2 for me as well. I couldn't even finish Revelations, it felt like such a rushed mess.  AC3 was also a disappointment. I appreciated the fact that they at least tried to shake things up, but overall it seemed like a bunch of half baked ideas.   Really, the only post AC2 game in the series that I've loved and felt like was a worthy addition was Black Flag. That one felt polished, thought out, well designed, and had that ""wow factor"" that the first two games had. I felt like ACIV:BF took all the good (yet unfinished) ideas of AC3 and actually developed them. Similar to AC2, it took all my nitpicks from the previous installment and fixed every single one of them. Black Flag was a hell of a game. For the first time since AC2 I felt truly drawn in and compelled to play an Assassin's Creed game.  I know this won't be a popular opinion here. I will add that I will continue checking out new AC games, mainly due to how much I loved the first two. I desperately want the series to win me over again. However, I strongly believe that making it an annual game ruined a series that had a ton of potential. I can't help but feel like every year there's a new Assassin's Creed game with some cool ideas that mostly feel unfinished. It feels like each game is a demo for next year's game, if that makes sense. Other than Black Flag, no post AC2 game has felt like a full experience. It's also really upsetting to see what they've done with the modern day story. (That is, they've all but obliterated it)  Maybe someday Assassin's Creed will win me back. I sure hope it does. But I'm not too optimistic about it.  tl;dr: Longtime fan, making the series annual ruined it. AC1, AC2, and ACIV:BF are the only truly great games."

assassinscreed,3dhp2n,Spelcheque,0,Thu Jul 16 18:21:38 2015 UTC,I like the yearly games - it‚Äôs great to have something to look forward to each year.  I just wish they‚Äôd: (1) being back a modern protagonist; (2) do current gen remasters of 2/Br/Re & III; and (3) make sure the story stays centered around the Assassins/Templars and that mythology (I‚Äôm hoping that‚Äôs the case with Syndicate and it‚Äôs not just trying to liberate London via gangs from the wealthy class).
assassinscreed,3dgnic,LambSausM8,23,Thu Jul 16 03:04:09 2015 UTC,"No one else seems to agree, but I'm with you. I've said it before - I want a game where we play as Darius and stab Xerxes in the ass with a hidden blade. There are so many options from the last 5,000 years to play with. They're going the wrong way."
assassinscreed,3dgnic,TheMovingParty,3,Thu Jul 16 04:57:18 2015 UTC,"They have to break their pattern at some point, they are coming very near to modern time so I'd bet we'll see one more from the threshold of modern time, maybe Russian revolution and after that they'll jump to ancient history and slowly build from there. I'd love to see game based on the very early civilizations, starting from Ancient Mesopotamia.  It might be more challenging setting for creators but it would be even culturally significant, there's not that many depictions of early civilizations in popular media. The earliest most games and films go back to is ancient Rome."
assassinscreed,3dgnic,santsi,10,Fri Jul 17 21:06:22 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree. I think Syndicate is the most modern the series should ever get. I'd love to go back to the 16th century or earlier.
assassinscreed,3dgnic,JadedDarkness,6,Thu Jul 16 09:10:19 2015 UTC,"I think the devs said they'd never go into the 20th century (in terms of the main story, not modern day), so syndicate is probably as far forward as it'll get"
assassinscreed,3dgnic,zgrove,6,Thu Jul 16 11:09:27 2015 UTC,"There are only so many time periods and locations in the past few centuries; no matter what they'll have to go further in the past somewhat soon.  The reason why is because it's easier use assets from other games to develop the next. Not only that, but in researching the time period, they will naturally learn more about other locations in similar time periods besides the one they're working on. When learning about history (especially as the world becomes more and more globalized), you see interconnectedness between places and events.  So they save time and money by doing what they already know/have.  But like I said, they'll run out of stuff in the 18th/19th centuries soon. I'm sure the 2016 game will be 19th century (because they are three year cycles and Unity started this cycle), but in 2017 there's a good chance we'll move on to something we haven't seen in a while."
assassinscreed,3dgnic,FlatTire2005,5,Thu Jul 16 06:03:43 2015 UTC,I want a Rome or Greece setting more and more by the day. Hopefully the game that recently went into development (which is the 2017 game) takes some inspiration from The Witcher 3.  I want horse's back dammit!!!

assassinscreed,3dgnic,Bababooey247,2,Thu Jul 16 13:22:32 2015 UTC,"I think because they're focusing on the Sage/Observatory angle for the moment and expanding on what is going on in the Americas & Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, it's easier for them to stick to a similar time period for at least Unity, Syndicate, and probably the game after that. I'd personally like some more connections between games, like mentions of previous games in Unity, Syndicate, etc.  However, after that, I'd love an ancient game. I think it'd be really interesting, though I'd be interested to see how they'd do it, especially if it's before Altair. I'd really enjoy Ancient Rome, Greece, or Egypt, personally. What could be interesting if they did something like Revelations and bounced between a more modern Rome/Greece/Egypt and ancient times. Specifically Egypt, since I know I've seen some speculation with Arno being in Napoleonic Egypt."
assassinscreed,3dgnic,thrntnja,2,Thu Jul 16 21:01:49 2015 UTC,"I actually want to go back to the 1100s, when AC1 was set. Preferably, I'd like to play a young Assassin adjusting to the change of Altair taking over the Brotherhood. How he/she feels about Altair, how he/she feels about the changes of the Creed compared to Al Mualim's teachings, and also how he/she develops into a Master Assassin under the guidance of a wiser Altair, a more accepting Maliki and a strong, strict Maria.  I loved this time period."
assassinscreed,3dgnic,karatekwonjitsu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:28:47 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, they can bounce to any time period whenever the creative director feels like it. We're in the 18th century now and anytime the next game can go back to, for example, the 13th century. I'm glad we get to see how the assassin presence is like in more recent periods, but I'm also hopeful to go a bit back in history. Maybe even before Altair."
assassinscreed,3dgnic,Mega1500,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:00:40 2015 UTC,"Personally I think that the Assassins Creed games are so popular because they allow the player to be immersed in a different world from today. From what I have learned is that AC fans like to be in the acient times, anything closer to our time period seems more boring. Back in Assassins Creed II, I remember running around as Desmond and found the morden world quite boring and looking forward to the times spent in Ezio's time. True it would be interesting to see what Ubisoft could do with Assassins in modern day, but I think the fans like to be in older times which seems different then our own."

Every historic people let Connor - a guy they barely know - lead their army for them?).  I haven't played Black Flag and Rogue but the 3 is kinda disapointing story wise.

Perhaps a piece of eden is relieved and it comes to reside in the home base of a group of assassins (you all can pick the time and location). Through the POE, Juno starts to whisper in the ears of all who live there, planting thoughts and talking up those who have a grain of darkness in their hearts. A rift begins to form, lines are drawn. Only one assassin in the bureau is immune to the thoughts and stays pure. It is his/her task to decide whether to destroy the POE and salvage what is left of the assassins or keep it and watch his brothers treat each other's to pieces. Can he sit by? Wil he take a side, not knowing what is in the hearts and minds of his brothers?  It's like ""Needful things""meets ""Highlander."""
assassinscreed,3dcu3u,Hideous-Kojima,2,Wed Jul 15 11:51:21 2015 UTC,"It's a cool idea, but the setting is still important. Ideally just before the Templars became globally dominant, simply for the irony that what brought down the Assassin order was the Assassins themselves.  I'm just spitballing here, but for a setting I'd pick the Boxer Rebellion. Sits nicely between Syndicate and World War 1, and local enough to be region-specific while still being something of a global conflict. There's a lot of ammunition there for an AC game, and not just using the conflict to foreshadow both the downfall of the Assassins in the 20th century, but also the 20th century itself.  For example, you have a secret society, the Yihetuan (Boxers) who believed they could summon spirit soldiers and claimed supernatural invulnerability. Which sounds like some Apple of Eden shit to me. The split in the Assassins could be one side believing that as Templars vs Assassins is a global conflict, nation states are irrelevant to their order as there is only one Creed, while the other side believes that a global conflict can only be won in uniting the various nations one at a time, and the only way to truly oppose the Templars is to be as strong as them, which requires the power of a nation behind them. And so against the backdrop of the Boxer Rebellion, you have various Assassin factions among the Eight-nation Alliance versus the Chinese Assassins with the Yihetuan and Qing Dynasty. A civil war hiding inside an international conflict."

Also what time and place setting did you have in mind?
assassinscreed,3dcu3u,Zero--Regen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:34:00 2015 UTC,"I give you huge props for coming up with such an interesting idea. You could roll right into a sequel with the Assassins in that area rebuilding and sorting out the carnage and destruction that was caused by the war. Then the Templars could use the opportunity to rise again (if we're going with the assassins had won) and try to take out the Assassins in their weakened state.

assassinscreed,3dheyo,Girasim,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:55:22 2015 UTC,"This Type of Ability is not new, however the Execution is quite new, let me assure you. The Hookblade is the better comparison, because the Hookblade allowed for both longer-distance horizontal jumps (if using a pot or hanging vase to Longjump) and for quicker Vertical Climbing (Hook-Leaps).   By and large, Revelations' Hookblade was an enjoyable mechanic. Additionally, the Rope Launcher would only take away from the game's depth if it didn't make any extra noise when used close to guards.   Overall, I think the Rope Launcher will be a fantastic addition, provided the rest of the Core Gameplay is designed around its uses and possible functions.  Assassins change with the times - as long as those changes are Fluid and satisfying to experience (unlike 90% of Unity's poorly-optimized changes) then they should be experienced.   On the whole, let me just mention that I do not understand why topics like these come up. The game is neither out, nor is it unannounced. What this means is that;  1) You're not going to change anything for the next AC game after Syndicate by claiming the Rope Launcher is Bad right now, because given that Syndicate's not yet out, no one has played the entire game with the Rope Launcher in mind.  2) You're not going to change Syndicate itself. The Rope Launcher is in the game. It has been decided by devs. This isn't something you can fight or campaign against. It will appear in the game, use it or not when you play it."

assassinscreed,3dbi4m,Freddiegristwood,2,Wed Jul 15 09:20:33 2015 UTC,"Aiming is one thing, actually hitting the target is quite another - the smoothbore barrel, the high recoil and (comparatively speaking) low muzzle velocity of the bullet does offset the aim of the soldier, so much so that it wasn't uncommon to aim slightly lower than the intended target, so as to offset the effect of recoil. Don't quote me, but with my own experience with muskets, they really aren't reliable creatures in terms of marksmanship - it's virtually impossible to get the pretty much 100% hit rate you do with AC3 muskets which, in terms of realism rather than gameplay, is kinda ridiculous."
assassinscreed,3dbi4m,Bekenel,3,Wed Jul 15 14:31:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely. But don't confuse inaccuracy to modern sentiments with inaccuracy to 18th century sentiments. A smoothbore, if the bore were properly drilled out (which obviously wasn't always the case), could be expected to hit a stationary, man-sized target somewhere on the body most of the time at 80 yards. You could probably hit more times than not at 100 yards, too. I've personally hit small (shako-sized) targets at 40-50 yards with some reliability.  So yeah, AC3 changed some things to make it less frustrating, but when you think of it, there is almost no engagement in the game that takes place at more than 100 yards or so, well within the accurate, lethal range of a smoothbore musket.  Aiming low is a complicated idea, actually. British and American (read: french) smoothbore muskets - specifically the long and short land patterns for the british and the french charlevilles for the americans) lacked a rear sight. Drill manuals talk about aiming along the bayonet lug or front sight (the british drill manuals actually do call the bayonet lug the front sight, by the way), but the problem is, with the lack of a rear sight, there's no way to know if you were aiming too high or too low, but officers figured out that, typically, soldiers fired high. So the correction was just that officers and NCOs would remind soldiers to aim lower than they think they ought to as a corrective.   Throughout the war, though, there were few times when there were extended exchanges of fire. The British learned pretty quickly that stopping in open fields exchanging fire with an enemy in a defensive position was suicidal, and so they urged their men to fix bayonets and charge, covering ground quickly, not giving the enemy time to fire more than a volley or two, and preventing their own men from stopping, clumping up, and getting shot down like at Bunker Hill."

assassinscreed,3d8pvw,charcurr1,6,Tue Jul 14 16:38:09 2015 UTC,"IMO Unity was meant to be with Connor. When you meet the Marquis de la Fayette in AC3 he says something like ""you should come and visit France"", and the Revolution starts about a decade after AC3. It would have made sense to have a more mature Connor going to the Old Continent to continue his work.  But Connor was quite disliked by players (he came right after Altair and Ezio...), so I think Ubisoft changed their plans and created a new assassin out of the blue."
assassinscreed,3d8pvw,Phenixxy,47,Wed Jul 15 10:26:19 2015 UTC,"I'd like one game that would tie up Conor, Shay, and Arno's intertwined story. I feel like Ubisoft missed a goldmine not having Arno explore his father's murder."

Then you pepper in details of what the Assassins and Templars were doing as it relates to the new character and the artifact. You get more story on existing characters, but because it's part of a new character's story. Like the ""Arno's Dad"" link between Rogue/Unity, or the bits of Altair in AC: Revelations. But it would also let them skip off to new settings and characters."

We hear from Charles Dorian that they are all but wiped out, so....?  But then, going back a bit, I'd love to see a Shay-like story for Haytham. He was loved as a child by an assassin father. I know Edward's murder and Jenny's kidnapping affected him, but what was young Haytham's trading and rise like? I know this really would be a pre-quel, but this story intrigues me."
assassinscreed,3d8pvw,LadyKlaymoor,9,Tue Jul 14 13:38:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I thought the story of Rogue tied together III, IV,and even Unity pretty good. A second game with Connor, either during the aforementioned War of 1812 or during the post-Rogue Assassin purge. Connor would make a better elder Assassin than Ezio. Take away the na√Øvete and 'CHARLES LEE HURR DURR!' and you would have a very wise Assassin who had seen a lot of Templars at ther worst. I'd play that in a heartbeat."

assassinscreed,3d8pvw,Anarion89,3,Tue Jul 14 17:49:59 2015 UTC,"I would like to make a connection between the end of AC Ro and ACIII. In AC Ro we see that Shay killed all but one assassin, it is even stated by Achilles that he was the last assassin in the US. Between AC Ro and ACIII, let's round things and say that for 15 years the templars were rooting its power and the assassins were being chased down. I don't know when the Arctic Confrontation happened, but by 1760[1] the assassins weren't a threat anymore to the templars and we can tell that between that and when ACIII there was no Assassin influence in the US, because the templars were stronger and there wasn't any reason to infiltrate assassin agents if the power was already established. So why the templars, after being defeated by Connor, would risk going back to the US if they had more power in Europe? Especially in the UK?    Edit: My guess would be that the Templar dominance in the US came back with the Wall Street Crash of 29."

I've played ac iii several times now, and I always try and do everything I possibly can with Haytham before the game switches characters.  Even Haytham's backstory is interesting in itself.

It's the same thing with Connor for me and it's that they gave a character with an interesting enough story but then forget they exist and never really tell the whole story of their life.

The cut dialog and plans weren't perfect but they would have added so much depth. Much less ""Where is Charles Lee!!!"" and more nuanced characterization.

assassinscreed,3d8pvw,uday113,5,Tue Jul 14 13:10:44 2015 UTC,Basically (and in line with most of the comments here) another game resolving Connor's and Shay's stories. Hell you could even end it with the cliched running at each with weapons...

assassinscreed,3d8pvw,ComdrShepard,2,Tue Jul 14 21:37:36 2015 UTC,"I would have to also choose Connor. He's a great character and I feel AC3 didn't do him justice... I would also love to see them tie together Rogue and AC3. That would be pretty awesome. That being said: I wish they would take a break from making new games and remaster some of the old ones. I love the original AC, but its graphics are terrible. They could easily remaster it to the standards of AC 3 or Black Flag."
assassinscreed,3d8pvw,PreppyDoge,2,Tue Jul 14 21:42:22 2015 UTC,"I too am going to say Connor but the main reason being that I think his character has so much room to grow. He was only about 26 at the end of AC3, and even though it's more subtle than Edward or Altair he does grow as a person. Especially if you play the Homestead missions. A sequel would give him the chance to really flourish and become awesome. He's wiser and understands American culture a lot more but he's also less intense and knows how to express himself better while still maintaining his Native American values and philosophies.  He doesn't even need to be the main character. Like, imagine a game where you play as Connor's young apprentice or something. He is now the mentor of the Colonial Assassins and has rebuilt the Brotherhood to something great once more with the help of Aveline."
assassinscreed,3d8pvw,greg225,2,Tue Jul 14 21:50:45 2015 UTC,"Connor for the win. I seriously thought that he was still young enough and strong enough to reveal more stories. I thought it would be cool if he united other natives to fight as well. I think it would be cool if someday we can interact more complexly with the AI. I think a great idea would be after saving districts and such from Templar control that some citizens would help you kill the enemy. I don't mean calling the assassins, I mean someone stepping in from any direction randomly. It would be nice to have 10 different ways to take down an enemy with them."

assassinscreed,3d8pvw,MishRae,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:40:27 2015 UTC,"Everybody is saying Connor, which would probably be nice, especially because with most of these games, the protagonists are fairly interchangeable-- Altair, Connor, Edward, and Arno are pretty bland, when you think about it.   Ezio, the only exception to the list (except for possibly Shay, who also fits the mold above somewhat) is an interesting character because he didn't just stay static for the story-- he actually developed as a character, and we got to see him as an infant, a teenager, a young man, a grown man, an old man, and even as a ghost, briefly. His entire life was so fleshed out for us that when he died at the end of Embers, it felt like we lost a friend and it was genuinely heartbreaking, even though he went out peacefully.   I'd like to explore Connor (and as some have suggested, Shay, Arno, and maybe, although the times likely wouldn't work perfectly, Jacob and Evie, in the same story as interchangeable characters a la Pillars of the Earth. It would be cool to see several major world powers like New York City, London, Paris, and even the Atlantic as the major playable cities/locations.) to see what he might have been like as an older man. I think there are a lot of themes that can be explored from the perspective of a bi-racial Native American man living in a 1700s era American city.   That's actually one of my biggest complaints about the AC series-- they introduce characters ripe for exploring due to the various cultures, and then they let them sit there and don't develop them as actual characters. They don't feel like real people, with the exception of Ezio. Revelations, for me, did wonders for both Altair's and Ezio's stories, and even made me like Altair a little bit more. Here was a man who lost his wife and one son in his twilight years, was chased from his home, and left to wander who knows where. He ended up losing so much. Ezio's tragedy was that he spent his entire adult life plagued by a mysterious message that, in the end, he would go to his grave without understanding because the gods were capricious like that: they didn't care that their message would torture Ezio, or whether he could understand it. All they cared about was making sure Desmond got the message, and they ended up ruining Ezio's life in the process. And in the end he died without knowing.   As a side note, I'd really like a full-on game with Shao Jun, if only to finally get closure on what was in Ezio's box.   TLDR just do for Connor what you did for Ezio: Make us like him. After AC3 I got the feeling that Connor was a very angry, damaged person, but it was communicated in such a hamfisted way that I ended up empathizing more with Haytham, and that's not great for your protagonist."

assassinscreed,3d8pvw,Ragadash7,0,Tue Jul 14 13:16:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd rather have new games than sequels, even if they tie together well (ie, I'd rather play an apprentice that seeks out Connor for training, than actually having a Connor sequel).  But if I had to pick one, I'd go with Altair, set between AC1 and his parts of Revelations, and include a lot more of the region and backstory of the Assassins and Templars (like the tombs and stuff from AC2/Brotherhood, artifacts of figures from history and their involvement in the Assassin/Templar conflict)."
assassinscreed,3d8pvw,JHawkInc,0,Tue Jul 14 22:08:14 2015 UTC,"I'd say Arno. I felt that in Unity, he was a little like Ezio, but more dull, but then the DLC Dead Kings opened his character a tad more. I want to see more of that - his recovery. I think from that perspective, they can really bring the character into his own.   All the assassins featured a relatively unique characteristic or setting:   Alta√Ør: He was the start of it all, this story that we have all been following. He was unique in that he built the Assassin's order from itself and laid the foundation for every future assassin. Ezio: The first really personal story, following the intrigues of renaissance Italy and murdered family. He featured in a vibrant setting, bringing the Assassins into arguably their strongest point. He was so well developed and loved that he garnered a trilogy.  Ratonhnhak√©:ton/Connor: He had great focus on Those Who Came Before. That said, I had more interest in seeing his father develop as a character over him - He gave us knowledge that the Templars are evil characters, but just different people with a different goal. I thought everyone surrounding Connor had better development than him and as such, I didn't really feel connected to Connor, although I liked his familial struggle, which we haven't seen before in the series until this point. This might seem contradictory to what I stated about Arno, but I will explain. I must admit, I felt that we got a good amount of closure in this storyline, which is why I don't think it needs any expansion. Although, I never played Shay's game, so this might be why I feel as such. Edward/Ad√©wal√©: A man in it for himself, interesting considering the creed of the Assassins. Edward was never seen fully as an Assassin. The only reason he appeared to have an alignment to them is the ideology of freedom shared between pirates and Assassins - that and some pirates were Assassins (Ad√©wal√©, Kidd etc.) Edward wanted riches - selfishness for material possessions was unique for an 'Assassin'. Ad√©wal√© on the other hand found his position with assassins due to his past, a shared trait from some other Assassins. Aveline: Can't comment, haven't played. Arno: A man who loses his family in a European city and sets out initially for revenge and ends up with the Assassins. He is well educated and lives well off, witty on occasion, sound familiar? Yup, he sounds like Ezio. But Ezio went to fight for the Assassins after his initial storyline, whereas Arno diverged and ended up hiding himself due to the events of his own storyline. I felt the Dead Kings DLC gave him some much needed development and gave us the beginning of a redemption arc or a sort of 'phoenix/ashes' vibe, something I feel they can run with. This is why I think Arno would be decent for more expansions."
assassinscreed,3db9k1,zgrove,11,Tue Jul 14 22:53:44 2015 UTC,"Everyone seems to forget AC was morally grey and that in the game it was stated that both Templars and Assassins were working to achieve peace... I haven't played it for a while though...  As for Ad√© in Rogue... He wasn't a bad person in it at all. At the very beginning he was unaware of what Shay would soon discover, and remained unaware the whole game. So, to Ad√©, Shay was a Traitor that turned against them for no valid reason. He had no idea the lust for the Temples was the reason why Shay turned against them, unaware of the impact they had when they were messed with. I don't think Ad√© was portrayed wrong or bad in Rogue at all.  Everything else, I pretty much agree with."

And who's to say that Lisbon wouldn't have been destroyed if the Templars found the Temple first? Did they somehow know that the POE would have done that?  OP hit the nail on the head that Rogue's characters never express any motive for their actions; they're just actors saying lines.

The game still has some optimization issues. What I can recommend you doing is lowering the settings. Use Geforce Experience if you don't already. I know people look down on Geforce Experience, but it does a somewhat reasonable job on choosing the best settings for your GPU.  If you really want 60fps, then you can either SLI it or overclock the crap out of your GTX 970 (not recommended)."

assassinscreed,3dd500,Freddiegristwood,6,Fri Jul 17 01:27:10 2015 UTC,"I think a punch to the stomach would be the toughest, but the most rewarding. I mean, don't matter how hard you are, a decent dig from Connor's gonna leave you winded, the actual punch would be the least of your worries. But, you tense as hard as you can, Hype yourself up with some angry music and close your eyes. And get winded like a motherfucker. So that lasts a bit, and being winded is fucking awful but once it's gone, you're like  ""Fuck yeah I just took a punch from Connor fucking Kenway fuck you guys I'm fucking nails can do fucking anything"" However, an unfortunate side affect of this new found confidence may be you going and trying the other two, basically nullifying the choice. 8/10 would give it a shot.  Now, the second option, for me, is a definite no go. For starters, I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter. I mean, it's ok, but do I like it enough to eat it off of some old Turks toes? I don't think so. Plus, peanut butter's got a right consistency to it, a consistency I wouldn't want to have on my toes, so Yusuf suffers in this one too. And the guys from like, 1511 or what. He aint gonna have clean digits. 2/10 would not do  The last ones tough. Who knows how Shay would react? I think he'd be ok with it. He'd just be like ""Yeah ok whatever"" I'm sure he's heard worse and he seems like a straight minded fellow. However, he is Irish, meaning there's an 80%+ chance he has large amounts of alcohol in his system, which I'd imagine would sway his reaction considerably. Another factor that I think would drop me in it is I'm English. I could probably outrun Shay though, he seems slow. 5/10 would consider."

Sums up Altair's Life over All 3 of his Games and convey's the story of Bloodlines way better than the game.   *Renaissance: Simply a summary of AC2. A bit more on Ezio's family.  *Brotherhood: A Summary of Brotherhood. Not very different from the game.  *Revelations: A greatly expanded summary of Revelations with much more time spent on side characters as well as the recruit missions and after the main story.  *Forsaken: The best of them all. Paints the Templars and Assassins as equally morally grey and humanizes Haytham as well as explaining the period between his appearance in Ac3 and Rogue in Europe, as well as why he hates Braddock. Also contains Connor's monologue, (greatest thing ever).  *Black Flag: Greatly expanded summary that makes all the characters feel more three dimensional. Also includes the events before and after the game (the ones after are sad af).  *Unity: Explains the game's story from Elise's perspective, as well as adds character to several of the game's side characters as well as it gives the events before the game, and the events after (Which may be a set up to syndicate).  Hope that helps."

Balancing combo-kills and taking away pausing mid-fight to change to a better weapon added more urgency and danger to combat.

assassinscreed,3dbsxg,BlueJimmyy,4,Wed Jul 15 01:35:51 2015 UTC,"I think he's the only character that comes close to Ezio, and I think it's because ac4 is such a huge game and the story seems like 2 games worth of story. We just need more than 1 game per protagonist"
assassinscreed,3dbsxg,zgrove,3,Wed Jul 15 02:14:18 2015 UTC,"No, I think what AC4 did right was just to drop into Edward's story right away.  No Sequence 1 watching him grow up in England and meet Caroline. No Sequence 2 where he joins the navy. We're Edward the Pirate from Sequence 1 Memory 1. The AC4 novel was perfect if you wanted to know more about Edward before and after the game, but ultimately ""unnecessary"" to enjoy the game's story.  This is what I think Unity (and 3) suffered from (well... Unity's story suffered from a lot more, but hey), and what probably any game with a protagonist that only gets 1 game would suffer from. Trying to show the origins of a character as well as the actual important parts of their lives clearly needs more than one game.  Unity's novel, although it does add more to it, suffered from the same problem that Unity's story was just kinda lame (I could expand on that, but that'd be off topic)  Syndicate sounds like we're being thrown right into the life of Jacob an Evie right away (considering the game completely takes place in 1868), so I'm actually optimistic too because of that."
assassinscreed,3dbsxg,GalakFyarr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:31:41 2015 UTC,"I never thought of it that way. I thought AC3 would've been way better if Haytham's part and the sequences 1-5 where he doesn't even have his robes were more condensed. It took so long to get going, but was so satisfying when it finally did. Could've been two really solid games I think. A more in depth look at Haytham following the events of the book up until we see Connor's village being burnt, and then opening on that with Connor's game. Would've added a ton in my opinion.  I only started playing through Unity yesterday, and am on the beginning of sequence 5, but Arno's intro seemed pretty short and sweet (maybe I liked it more because of Rogue) and I'm excited to see where the story goes, and how Elise will fit into it. I'll wait till I'm finished to voice my finial opinion, but for now the map seems really overwhelming even compared to 4, and I'm not really invested in the city, and am just trying to streamline through the story in preparation for Syndicate, which I'm actually hyped for.

assassinscreed,3dbsxg,Scottish_Prussian,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:19:51 2015 UTC,"I'm content with the time we had with Ezio. I am strongly in favor of a new trilogy to focus on a character and invest us in their struggles. Ezio may have been more likeable and more easily invested in, but no other character is even given a chance to come close. The characters just haven't felt as fleshed out, but that's because we spend less and less time with them. Especially Connor and Arno are short changed by their lack of screen time. Although I like Arno, he feels mostly empty. He probably had the fewest lines of any assassin, and as a result I've never quite got a handle on him or his motivation. Love or redemption, or maybe revenge? The last two are separated by a thin line, and I know many felt he was more on the revenge side of it.   While we saw Ezio adapt to three different scenarios (revenge quest, city liberation, and quest for knowledge), we only ever saw Connor (LEE! Jk save the village too) and Arno (find out why Monsieur de la Serre was murdered and bang his daughter) find their way through one. How would Connor or Arno interact with a totally exotic place, the way Ezio did in ACR? How does Arno continue his life without Elise? What are Connor's best pick up lines?   TOKW and Dead Kings helped each somewhat, but it's hard to be invested in a character when each is given a shorter gig than the last."

There is a lot to do, but about 80% of it gets repetitive and boring. Unity has more customization than any other AC game.   Unity is to me, the worst in the series over all. The worst part of the game is the story. It is so bland and predictable I don't even know how to express it.

Paris is absolutely incredible and there are so many spots in the city where you can find things to do. It truly feels like you are apart of the French Revolution.

It has no outcome that affects present day at all. Story (present day) virtually non-existent. Black Flag and Rogue, in comparison, are full-on modern day experiences! Things to do: lots more. More chests, more missions, more everything. Trouble is, a lot of it's actually very dull and tedious. Outfits: ridiculously beautiful, seriously. The ""legacy"" outfits are gorgeous. Graphics: stunning. Free-run: not as polished as 3/4/Rogue, and a little clunky. Combat: harder to start with, but slow and again, a little clunky.   Overall: compared to the other games, Unity shines in its graphics and depiction of Paris.

I can see the hat/hood dynamic working like an alter ego thing; since the common person knows nothing of the Assassins and Templars, the hat would give Jacob a public persona that would allow him to work in the open, while the ""man in the hood"" would be seen as some daredevil vigilante."

Because scholars pretty much had free range of the cities during the time period, this allowed the Assassins to get closer to their targets without being seen. They became impractical in Assassin's Creed 2 where scholars were removed, but at that point the beaked hood (along with the hidden blade) was the Assassin icon, although the beak was removed in Black Flag and some hood variants in Unity, possibly Rogue as well.  At the end of Assassin's Creed 3, Conner's hood was permanently lowered, showing his native mohawk and ponytail for the remainder of the game. After immense backlash from fans, Ubisoft patched the game to give him back his hood outside of the Homestead. Clearly fans continued to see the hood as an iconic piece of the franchise so I don't think Ubisoft is all too keen on getting rid of it just yet.""

The goal was to allow someone who was tolerant of other religious beliefs to take the throne.    The Assassins cared little for religion.  The Vatican was and continued to be a world force, and Elizabeth was in direct opposition to the Vatican.  It seems reasonable that Fawkes would have been a Templar and the Templar would have still been siding with the Vatican as they had previous ties to the Catholic Church."

There is a time and place to criticise religion, obviously, and one would assume that a subreddit dedicated to atheism would be one.

Absolutely none of us know what happens after we die, because the living aren't dead. The people on /r/atheism call everyone idiots and call religion a cancer to society and an evil thing.

The rest of your comment just sounds like you either haven't been anywhere near it recently, or you're too ""sensitive"" and consider any jab at religion to be cirklejerky or ""anti-theism"".

The people on /r/atheism[2] call everyone idiots and call religion a cancer to society and an evil thing.   Funny you mention it, because those are my views (sort of). I consider religion a bad thing that should be actively discouraged because it condones uncritical thinking and blind faith.   Do I consider every religious people evil? of course not. Is religion itself evil? I'm sure there is an example of one that isn't, but the 3 major ones (Christianity, Islam and Judaism) are a definite YES to that answer. They all perpetuate backwards beliefs that to this day harm people (or society in general) on a daily basis for things nobody can prove are true (or worse: have been debunked decades ago, see creationism)  Just because nobody knows what happens after death doesn't suddenly mean we should give the utmost respect to those who claim to know. I'm not advocating that there is nothing after death. I'm advocating against blind faith. None of the major religions have provided any evidence for what they claim - mentioning this is necessary.  However, do I walk up to every religious people I meet and start debating them (or whatever)? No. of course not. Because I'm not an asshole.   But if you would stand next to me and claim ""I saw Jesus today"", I will not be ashamed to laugh in your face - unless you show me evidence."

Buggy gameplay, terrible framerate, etc. The story seems to be the same usually. Character loses family member and join Assassin order for revenge/redemption. AC4 did not do this. They introduced completely new gameplay (ship mechanics) with a world that was completely new (cities in AC are very well known already, Black Flag gave us the Caribbean). It also gave us a new story of Edward and who he was. Black Flag not only explored Edward's journey as a character, but what the Creed means in itself.

assassinscreed,3d9ef4,AboveAverageCats,0,Tue Jul 14 21:18:31 2015 UTC,"For what reason? Just because they're games that happen to be Assassin's Creed? Liking something just because of name rather than content is very bad. I love Assassin's Creed as a series as much as the next guy, but even I'm not blind to see what kind of game Unity was. I'm going to copy what this guy said in another post, he explains it better than I do.  Plenty of people have given their opinion and criticism after the months Unity was released. But to summarize on top of my head:   Modern day story(whatever little there is) is a joke. The historical story is ... average at best and lacks focus. You kill all these people with little to no context and there's very little characterization to the enemies you're fighting. Ending is lackluster and anticlimatic,the main villain is bland and forgettable. Every single side character is underdeveloped,Elise is brutally underused and her relationship with Arno could have used some more screen time. Technical issues - the game was a mess on consoles,but doubly so on PC. Bugs,glitches,performance issues,connectivity issues. I hear it's mostly fixed right now on consoles,but last time I played on PC(with latest patch 5 installed) I still got stuck a few times and got a few other minor bugs. The performance is still terrible on PC and you'll need a beefy rig if you want to play on high details with high framerate. Microtransactions Unity app and Initiates website - I don't mind the Initiates website so much,but the app was total bullshit. Took me almost a month until I got everything done in it just,so they can remove it as an requirement(which is good,but I hated wasting so much time for nothing). Collectibles - there were simply way too many of them. Hundreds of chests with different colors and requirements for unlocking them,cockades,sync points that required you to roam the co-op missions(when everyone else was rushing for the objective). The map was literally riddled with those,which made it really hard to navigate it and the reward from each chest was so small it was barely worth the effort. Bad storytelling Ezio v2.0 albeit more cliche and stupid Less interesting story Cliche betrayal elements. Annoying AI (snipers shoot with 100% accuracy from a mile away) Less responsive cover mechanic   And the biggest reason in my opinion is that Ubisoft knew that the game was in this state, and terribly optimized and buggy, yet they released it. Now that's just bullshit."
assassinscreed,3d9ef4,AssassinG,2,Tue Jul 14 21:51:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's all true. Unity was probably the worst thing put out  in the series since 3, maybe. But I still liked it, for what it was.

assassinscreed,3d9ef4,AboveAverageCats,0,Tue Jul 14 21:56:34 2015 UTC,"That's terrible. You're basically saying to the publisher ""I don't care how shit the games you put out! As long as it's part of the same franchise, I'll love it and buy it!"". Seriously, that attitude is cancerous and is what kills series. I do not fall in the mob mentality of liking something because of brand name, such as you are doing with Assassin's Creed. It's cancerous and a fucking terrible practice. It means you'll be okay with getting a shitty game as long as it has the name. You have to judge on the individual product. That's how you judge without bias, and that is how you should always judge games. The franchise name is there to see what game you're getting (An AC game, Batman: Arkham game, Witcher game, etc.), but it is not there for you to say ""I automatically like every AC game because it's AC"". Take me for example. ""I hated Unity. 'Why?' Because it was a bad game. I feel that I did not get my money's worth because even though it was an Assassin's Creed game, it was still a bad game. I do still however love the franchise because I think the story is extremely unique and well thought out, even if the series has fallen on hard times."" There. Bam. It's done.

Hell, they were so lazy that made Arno an Ezio clone. How is that good writing? The story is horribly weak, and so many characters are underdeveloped.

The campaign was fun as hell as well, continuing after World at War. Black Ops 2 introduced being able to choose in the campaign and watching your actions have consequences. They did a bit of work on zombies and made multiplayer more team based, based on points rather than kills. Finally, Black Ops 3 is looking to present a more interesting story, that presents morally grey questions of right and wrong, and zombies is look sweet again. Treyarch, in my opinion, tends to be the only Call of Duty developer to actually innovate and really care for the series."

Brown Bess, the legendary musket that was standard issue for British for over 100 years, was not made yet in Black Flags time so it somewhat made sense that people carried swords. However in Rogue, especially in New York, it doesn't make sense. The guards in Rogue also patrol in too small groups, usually around 4. Combat in AC was never challenging before Unity but at least ACIII compensated by making you fight about dozen at once. Fights in Rogue are just way too short and easy."

The Chinese, Indians, Malays, Thai, Portuguese, Dutch, Ottoman were all involved during that time. All this different cultures in one place. It would make a great game or a trilogy even.  First game can explore 1000AD when a South Indian King traveled and built Kingdoms in North Malaysia. There were wars between the Indian (Chola) Empire in Malaya and neighboring kingdoms.  Second game can explore the 16th century Portuguese-Malacca war. Features the intervention of the Ming Dynasty, attack of Malay Pirates, decline of Hindu/Indian kingdoms, capture of Malacca etc.    Third game can explore 18th century British rule of South-East Asia.

The time period (1618-1648) is a good halfway point between Revelations (1511) and Black Flag (1712), we can have a German Assassin, we can explore the largest cities of central Europe (Prague, Vienna, Cologne, Nuremburg), there are plenty of historical events to witness or participate in (Defenestration of Prague, Battle of the White Mountain, Battle of Breitenfeld) and there are a number of important historical figures you can meet (King Gustavus Aldophus of Sweden, Galileo Galilei, Cardinal Richelieu)."

Preferred Cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou   China has been neglected far too long in the franchise.  The 1911 Revolution and Warlord Period was divided, with Communists, monarchists, the Kuomintang, liberal democrats, gangsters and foreign powers fighting over influence in China.    The period would provide ample opportunities for covert action, assassination and intrigue.  Furthermore, China was not militarily advanced during this time, and games like Splinter Cell have shown AC style games can work and be successful with modern settings.  Finally, with most Chinese cities retaining their traditional architecture, the settings would be excellent."

I've never come as close to tearing up in a game as I had when Connor was digging his grave and 'Achilles' read his letter. Connor putting a feather on his coffin made me smile (and like Connor even more).  When you finally put up the painting of his family I looked at it in-game for about five minutes, thinking about all Achilles has gone through. Connor's final goodbye to him added icing on the already sad cake and made me stare at the grave for ten minutes before moving on.  Whenever I play AC3, I sometimes visit his grave and think about the amazing story the game had. Finishing Rogue gives you a different perspective on it and IMO makes it even better."

assassinscreed,3d1njd,AwesomeInPerson,3,Mon Jul 13 13:00:11 2015 UTC,"Tips for Immersiveness:  a) Turn off HUD. Everything besides SSI and Minimap is unneccessary anyway, and you can even go without Minimap if you try.  b) Try to act as realistically as possible. If Ezio's 'mission' is to buy himself new equipment at the blacksmith, would he sprint there like a maniac, arriving breathless, barely being able to mutter 'Salve'? Or would he take a chill walk through the city to get there, like normal people? (hint: the latter)  c) Don't use fast travel! Always travel the world 'manually', whether by foot, on top of a horse or as blind passenger in a wagon - and take in your surroundings.  d) Adjust your appearance: When in Venice, put on some venitian clothing, when in San Gimignano, put on some tuscan-ish brown clothing, and so on.  e) Adjust your weaponry: Even though it doesn't make a difference in the AC series, always choose the appropriate weapons. Huge battle ahead? Equip some bigass axe. Fighting only a few, swift guards? Switch to your dagger. Stealth mission ahead? Use an unsuspicious, thin sword and a normal knife as dagger. (or get rid of the sword altogether by eqipping an axe and throwing it away)  f) Combat: Fight realistically. Use different techniques, mix killstreaks with dodges, blocks and so on. Don't slice through 30 guards in one huge kill streak, that's just ridiculous if you think about it.  g) The Creed: You are not supposed to kill innocents, so think twice before you kill. Does this guard on patrol, just doing his duty, deserve to die, only because he happens to be marked with a red dot on the map? Do you have to punch this beggar, only because he's starving and dares to ask for help?  h) Do what Altair/Ezio/Whoever would have done, even if Optional Objectives demand something else. ( I can sneak in there, do what I have to do, and vanish without anybody noticing. Why would I try to poison 4 guards using pink poison darts hitting at 60¬∞ angles ?! )"
assassinscreed,3d1njd,azinrill,2,Mon Jul 13 11:15:03 2015 UTC,"Thakyou very much ! A very detailed response. I've already stopped playing AC1, gonna go straight to AC2. I've done this marathon before and even if the story of AC1 can be interesting, the gameplay is just SO boring. I had never thought of changing weapons or clothing. For combat : If there are more than 5-6 guards RUN, you're a very competent fighter, but you aren't superman. I was a fool to try and follow optional objectives (just for the ""You did it"" feeling), choosing my own path that seems the most logical would feel better."
assassinscreed,3d1njd,ice74205,2,Mon Jul 13 11:42:05 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, very good post. This is pretty much how I have played, although I was fool too doing these optional objectives (some of which are really stupid). However I don't agree with not using fast travel - you already are forbidden from using it on memories and I bet in real life long journeys aren't something you enjoy, but rather you try to busy yourself with something to draw attenion from it (books, music). To add to that, in AC it's not magical fast travel teleport but rather some transport system that assassins used. Just don't overuse it.  I would also add:  e) It makes sense to use blunt weapons when fighting heavy armoured guards (in reallity swords would rather just slide off them). IMO hidden blades should be used mainly for assasinations and in situations where you are caught off by surprise (you don't have time to draw your weapons)  f) Combat: Try not to get hit at all (it also adds chalenge to gameplay). Stem yourself from using medicamets. You really think someone would took ~10 hits in combat and then just smell some salts and continue? Also in AC1 it is said that when you lose your sync bar it's meant that your ancestor didn't do that (so Altair is so baddas he never really get hit :)).  j) The Brotherhood: Use your recruits whenever it seems reasonable - facing bigger groups enemies, taking off some guards which Master Assasin really should not waste time dealing with. I also think in ACR where Ezio was quite old he would relly even more on his fellow assassins.  k) The Creed x2: Pickup generall style of play - are you perfect, stealth Master Assassin, or maybe you stick with original, medieval Assassin's ideology, ""a blade in a crowd"" (getting quick kill in public and then running away using extraordinary freerunning skills). Even some more combat-heavy approaches can be used if you can justify them :). It also may depend solely on your choice, personality of the character or just circumstances your character happens to be.  l) The flow: Before you travel to some city think about what your goals are and how many things you plan to do here. Don't just shift between places randomly, imagine you spending some time in one city beacue ""you have job to do"". After some intense events take a break and take a walk around the streets. If you go back to ""home"" (Masyaf, Monteriggioni, Homestead) spend some time relaxing and preparing for next mission (choosing weapons, training for example).  The biggest problem I had with immersion is SSI and minimap beacue all the information it gives you could be done with just better eagle vision but IT ISN'T. I really wish I could climb the viewpoint and from here see (within EV) general direction where I am supposed to go, or guards positions (the rendering distance is just too small), maybe even markers for important spots (shops, etc.). However I don't know about Unity - I saw something similiar to this on Youtube but haven't had chance to play."

The only thing I'd need on my HUD is the minimap, health bar, and mission objectives, but the minimap is huge (and ugly), the health bar is huge and full of unnecessary info (like my rank), and the mission objectives is huge as well.  No whistling or ways to lure guards outside of letting them see you, waving hi, then corner killing them when they walk to you like an idiot.

Those were relived by Ezio through memory seals, ancient precursor tech. You were basically reliving memories of a guy reliving memories. The seals just required you to 'upload' your memories into them and was not limited to your memories prior to having children.

EDIT: yikes i didn't even answer the thread title. yes i would be open to a trilogy but i also think the current format can work if the stories are more whole."
assassinscreed,3czqh2,GraphiteDoll,6,Sun Jul 12 12:39:25 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying. I feel like I like Ezio because he's a compelling character, yeah, but he had great development over 3 games. By the time we got to him in Revelations he was this wise and masterful Assassin, and we got to see that happen over his life. Part of why I think we need a trilogy is I fear future assassins won't be completed because they only get one game. Arno's story just ended after Germain, and Dead Kings didn't show a lot either."
assassinscreed,3czqh2,GraphiteDoll,4,Sun Jul 12 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"i might be nitpicking a little but while, yes, i agree with you that accompanying Ezio over 3 games (and a heart breaking animated short) definitely helped cement his position in our hearts, i still don't really agree that good character development is directly dependent on how many games the character is in.  i'm all for trilogies if that's what it takes for ubisoft to pull off good character development, hell bring on the quartets if that means i'll get an even bigger payoff (apparently ""saga"" isn't the right name for a group of 4...?), but i think ubisoft should be just as able to tell a compelling story with good character development and character arcs and all that jazz in a single game.   i typed up a big long thing about unity but then backspaced all of it cause it kind of went off on a tangent, so i'll just say i remember when the game first came out a few people here thought Arno was going to be spearheading his own trilogy and while i'm sufficiently invested in Arno to welcome a sequel or 2 staring him, i think trilogies should be used to enhance the experiencing of a story and not as a crutch, as a convenient ""this character didn't develop enough in this game... but that's ok we'll just make up for it in the next, he has 2 more games anyway"" escape plan.  just my 2 cents anyway."

assassinscreed,3czqh2,McCracKenway,7,Tue Jul 14 03:40:28 2015 UTC,"I remember a suggestion about a game set during Thirty Years' War - but I see it not as a trilogy, but an epic saga set all over central Europe with multiple protagonists from different years and places. Let's say every game has three protagonists, each with his own set of locations and own story. Every story is like a piece of a puzzle - it is standalone and self contained at first sight, but as you keep learning more, you'll better understand different things and uncover hidden secrets. And of course you'll be able to meet different characters at different times of their lives, visit same places before, during and after war and so on.   And the best part is Thirty Years War is a complex event, that has everything in it - not only battles, but politics, religous conflict, witch hunts, plague, ect."
assassinscreed,3czqh2,JSTucker12,8,Sun Jul 12 14:02:59 2015 UTC,"I made this point in the last (last meaning last recorded, still think it's yet to be released) Animus Island podcast. Basically, a trilogy with recurring characters is more compelling than a bunch of one off games. You get to see and connect to characters for longer and care about their continuing struggles, whereas with something like Unity you get a handful of characters with sometimes less than ten minutes of screen time like the Marquis de Sade or Napoleon (at least in the main story).   The other advantage of a trilogy is that you can build up to a big payoff in the third game. You need these arcs or you just have a bunch of iterative titles. That was a benefit of the modern day, but it shouldn't be restricted to it, especially as Ubisoft keeps trying to cater to new players who want it gone. A trilogy would interest people in the story over multiple games, whereas now they have to get you interested in a new story with new characters every single time.   Right now they're doing new stuff every game to get to more places that fans want to see. That's one advantage of the animus framing device. You can go anywhere. That doesn't mean you always should though. When AC first began, the amazing attention to the detail of landmarks and cities was a major draw. It still is somewhat, but it's expected every time too. It's no longer enough of a draw to stand on its own. And with the animus, they never have to do one trilogy like most games. They don't have to worry about how they continue after they've wrapped it up, because they can just start a new trilogy elsewhere. They don't have the issue that most trilogies do when they want to continue.   So, recurring characters and building arcs, as well as the fact that Ubisoft can avoid many problems that most series that do trilogies face. The smart move would be to stick to a character, do a trilogy, then do a new one. Right now the games are barely linked. Sure, we had ""the Kenway trilogy,"" but it was missing the most important parts of good trilogies. Right now, AC's story is not compelling. It could be, but they've explicitly said they're not going that route, and it's extremely silly of them.   Didn't mean to go on that long.   Edit: fixed a word"
assassinscreed,3czqh2,nikolai393,4,Sun Jul 12 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, I enjoyed the length. I agree completely with this and I appreciate you taking the time to comment. In Unity I liked Arno and I cared about his whole quest for redemption, even though it was executed poorly. But I kept getting reminded that i'm never going to see these people again. Next year it'll be another cast of characters. I can still like the characters in that one game, but I feel it's a missed opportunity to not develop them over more games. Not just in Unity, but the same thing could happen in Syndicate."
assassinscreed,3czqh2,majesticscarfripple,3,Sun Jul 12 17:47:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely. With Syndicate as well I could see the problem exacerbated, as well have a split between two characters, each of whom we'll probably not get to know as well as even Arno.

To not detract anything from Ezio's character, one of the reasons everyone loves him is because we spent so much time with him. We got to see his journey from a happy go lucky teenager into a wise old man. I would love to see what Connor or Arno did in their later years. It would help me appreciate them more as characters."

assassinscreed,3czqh2,INeedChocolateMilk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:34:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm...in terms of a character based trilogy (Ezio), no. In terms of a running theme trilogy (Americas), yes. My thoughts on why/why not.  I lived Ezio. He was (and still is) my favorite assassin. In AC2 we got to become emotionally invested in his life from birth until he was in his early 40s. Witnessing his birth, his reason for becoming an assassin, his rise and stumbles. Participating in his trading was all great. In AC:B, seeing him mature into Il Mentore was great and flowed naturally. Ac:R disappointed me, even though seeing an older wiser Ratio was naturally the next step. I didn't realize why until thinking about wrong this response.  Ezio was not just awesome because if who he was, but because if those who supported him. His games were great because we, as players, were also invested in his friends and family. I loved Tazim, but he couldn't make up for Leonardo, Machiavelli and La Volpe. Sophia was ""meh"" compared to the heartbreak of Cristina, the intrigue of Katarina, and the attitude of Claudia. I'm afraid, all in all, that a character based trilogy would just let me down again.  Now, that being said, a thematic trilogy, I'm up for. The Americas trilogy was like watching a Quentin Tarentino flick...you get to the end and still think about how all the pieces fit together. I'm still contemplating how AC:BF was first chronologically, and how that fed into Rogue which led to AC3. Heck, even Freedom cry slid into the trilogy. Seeing the motivations of the assassins AND Templars during that huge chunk of time has really kept me thinking. I'm honestly still undecided in which side I'm on. The actions of Achilles are still haunting me...He knows not to touch the precursor sites, but he's apparently he'll bent if vengeance against Haythem. But I digress.  Even Rogue acted as a vehicle to pass the nation to Unity with the final scene. It was brilliant.  So, gimme a thematic trilogy any day. I'd love to see another Templar POV game after Syndicate, seeing as how the rise of gangs in syndicate reminds me of Hope heading up the gangs in Rogue..."
assassinscreed,3cz5v6,Lwsrocks,32,Sun Jul 12 02:44:36 2015 UTC,"'Ezio was great, but now his character type has been done before, and we're tired of it.' In fact, that's what a lot of you said when Edward Kenway was revealed.   It's weird how people were bashing on Edward for being a 'playboy' when instead we got one of the most human characters in the franchise. We've all been greedy and have thought money is the most important thing in the world. All Edward wanted to do is provide for his wife and family to live a better life, not go to the Bahamas, get drunk, sleep with every female in sight and blow shit up.  Jacob might be brash, but his reasoning will most likely be more deep than what the trailers have shown. Promotional trailers are supposed to cater to a wide audience (which mostly consists of people (or children) who don't care about story, they just want to blow shit up). NEVER judge a character and his/her motives by a trailer."

Its bound to happen that the many protagonists are going to be the same since their characters have only been developed over the course of one game. Ubisoft needs to sit down and pick a protagonist to use for the next three games to really develop the character's personality into a complex web. No one's going to feel connected to a protagonist thats barely been developed and only used in one iteration. This is a huge reason why Ezio is so beloved. Its because over the course of three games we got to really get to know him and connect with him. We got to know his story from beginning to end and with out the use of wikis for the most part unlike we do now with all the other protagonists we've had. In the ezio trilogy it was almost as if Ezio was a different character in each game. By the end of it he had three very colorful and interesting layers to his personality that basically made him Dos Equis' Most Interesting Man in the World"

assassinscreed,3cz5v6,euricus,3,Sun Jul 12 14:22:34 2015 UTC,the reason being is for every protagonist we've had the first impressions are that he's a ezio clone. For some reason ubisoft wants every protagonists first impressions to be like an ezio clone. That's all we've ever seen out of the protagonists. We've never got to truly see what really lies inside of the character with the exception of maybe Edward. I give Edward some slack because he wasn't actually a ladies man in the game and he actually changed his motives half way through the game.

I read this, and with the line    Yes, he's probably going to be the brash playboy protagonist we've seen before a few times...   My brain automatically went, ""It'd be interesting and different if he were gay."" As in, homosexual.   I'm not telling a single person to hear me out, because it doesn't matter. I can undermine myself in one foul swoop: You need to have kids to pass on DNA, which is effectively impossible as a homosexual in, say, Victorian London. Let alone finding other gay men to, y'know, be gay with. Kinda cuts out the playboy.   Basically, Jacob isn't going to be gay. And, for some reason, that bums me the fuck out."

I was comparing going straight down across all of the games. And of course it's easier having to press one button and have it done automatically, but that doesn't mean it's inconvenient or impossible to do it in the other games. At least for the Anvilnext games all you have to do is move forward when you want to grab another ledge. And in a tall enough building you can actually get down a lot faster by waiting until the last few ledges to grab on again.

Climbing through windows and balconies from the outside is an absolute nightmare, he only seems to want to go around them and not inside. On the ground it's easy to get stuck behind things like chairs and benches because they're practically bolted to the ground.  On a surface level it brought a lot of improvements over the old system but it's still iffy."

It was their first game that also only ran on  8th generation consoles.  It may take a year or two for them to figure out precisely how to work out the mechanics, but I think it will end up running (no pun intended) pretty well."

They've cut corners on composers, directors, writers, and pushed ahead with multiple annual titles just on the strength of the setting, and that weakness is starting to show.

Don't get me wrong, there's nothing that quite beats the feeling of counting the days to the release of the new big game you're looking forward to. Nevertheless, when not being aboard the oh so incredible hype train, ones expectations are lowered. The expectations for Unity were huge, with its new big city, all new control system, the first true next-gen AC game, a huge graphical leap, and so on, but the ridiculously high expectations caused the game to crash and burn, and when it did, it did so in a much worse manner because people had to great expectations.   I feel like maybe Ubisoft is trying to lower our expectations on purpose, because they learned what happens when you promise too much and don't deliver. And not that was ever going to pre-order the game after the train wrecks of Unity and Watch_Dogs, but it makes it easier to say no.   That I'm not at all intrigued with Syndicate is then something entirely else, so that is also a factor in my non-hype state of mind here. It just seems like Unity 2.0 with a few new gadgets, and a new setting plus characters.   But all in all, I'm glad I'm not hyped. Being hyped can only lead to either total heartbreak when the game doesn't deliver, or mediocre ""yeah, it was great, just as I thought"", so lowering expectations is the key to positive surprises, but of course I keep my fingers crossed for Syndicate, but I'm staying sceptic."

Evie feels like too much an afterthought and Jacob is very clearly their focus which sucks because he's a boring rehash of characters we've already played while she's at least something different.  I'm not going to fault them for including her because hey, better than nothing. But Dishonored 2 is really emphasizing Emily's prominence in almost the exact opposite way (if one didn't know better, one may assume that Jacob was the lone protagonist of ACS while the same would be said of Emily for Dishonored 2 when in truth, both games have a male and female playable character) AND both games are somewhat similar with a Victorian or Victorianesque atmosphere, dual protags, heavily feature assassinations. Plus Dishonored 2 already confirmed that Emily and Corvo would have entirely different powers while Evie and Jacob share the same things.  I'll probably pick up Syndicate when it goes on sale but I'm not getting it this holiday season. There are more games I'm more interested in."
assassinscreed,3cy5e7,thehypotheticalnerd,2,Sat Jul 11 22:57:51 2015 UTC,We've heard her and Jacob say a few lines and kill people. How people can instantly say that she's unique is beyond me. I'm excited for both.
assassinscreed,3cy5e7,Fateblast,0,Mon Jul 13 14:57:22 2015 UTC,"Based km what they've said she's like: cool, rational, calculating.  He's that brash, fun loving, boisterous guys we've already played as with Ezio, Edward, and Arno. Yes, all three of those characters have their differences but they all share very numerous similarities, Ezio and Arno especially.  So Jacob just sounds way less interesting than Evie because the only person who really sounds similar is Altair."
assassinscreed,3cy5e7,thehypotheticalnerd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:33:27 2015 UTC,"I see. Still, I think that Jacob will end up surprisingly unique like Edward. At least I hope so."
assassinscreed,3cy5e7,Fateblast,2,Mon Jul 13 18:39:48 2015 UTC,"It saddens me that I am not even hyped for this game. As some of the other comments said, I sort of hope this game bombs to send a message to ubi.  Believe me, I love the series, to the point that I even have Ezios belt buckle tattooed on my arm, but I am willing to sacrifice this segment of the series in order to get something that we will actually love.   I want the modern day, I want the PoE, I want TWCB, I want everything that made me fall in love with the series. If I wanted to just kill things with a sword or dagger and be stealthy, I would play Shadow of Mordor (which is a great game for those who haven't played).   I want the series to get back on track."
assassinscreed,3cy5e7,dcw14,3,Sun Jul 12 19:33:28 2015 UTC,"It's hard to be hyped with Syndicate cause they haven't shown us a preview of the story or the lore. All we kept seeing is Jacob, Evie taking down goons, battling the Templar rule in London.  If they show us Juno, in next-gen graphic glory, then by all means, color me hyped"
assassinscreed,3cy5e7,blackcoffin90,4,Sun Jul 12 10:53:43 2015 UTC,"I wish I was hyped.  Victorian London was my number 1 wish for an AC setting with Paris a close second.  And I loved Unity as well (no game breaking bugs for me).  But idk, seeing the gameplay trailer? I guess it doesn't really look like the game I had hoped for and looks more like a poor imitation of a GTA game.  I think Jacob looks silly, combat looks same as ever, it all just looks very brown.  The accents are somehow less British than the ""French"" characters in unity too.  Hope I'm wrong and that it'll be my favourite AC game but so far nothing has really got my looking forward too it, which is a first in terms of the series for me personally."
assassinscreed,3cy5e7,CitizenWolfie,2,Sat Jul 11 23:13:37 2015 UTC,"I wasn't hyped for Black Flag at all, but I still was excited for it and bought it the day it came out. It was nice since I didn't watch any gameplay or story trailers, so I knew pretty much nothing about what was going on.

assassinscreed,3cy5e7,minion3,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:36:55 2015 UTC,Its because Syndicate is Unity version 2 like Rogue was black flag version 2. and i think there's going to be limitations to what Assassin creed universe can do as it moves to the modern age.

It's not a full game I know but still more than Egypt is to get for all we know. But honestly there is so much to explore with in both regions and cultures either one would be awesome.
assassinscreed,3cyf5b,Shouvanik,7,Sun Jul 12 00:46:20 2015 UTC,"One problem with Egypt is probably lack of tall buildings other than pyramids. Pyramids can serve good purposes as crypts but where would we perform leap of faith?  Being an Indian, I would like to have a full 3D game in India. Chronicles is just a sidescroller and china had next to no story and terrible voice acting."
assassinscreed,3cyf5b,Pentaghon,4,Sun Jul 12 03:03:09 2015 UTC,"Perhaps they could do Ptolemaic Eygpt? You'd have Greek and Egyptian buildings merged and mixed together, so while there wouldn't be too many extremely tall buildings, there would be some.    Plus, the Lighthouse of Alexandria."

assassinscreed,3cyf5b,smoha96,2,Sun Jul 12 03:45:43 2015 UTC,"Given that Syndicate's in the Victorian era, an India game set around the same time doesn't sound like too much of a stretch."

assassinscreed,3cyf5b,ares2596,2,Sun Jul 12 07:10:34 2015 UTC,A game set in Alexandria would be the absolute best.

I think that Sofia is building an original title for 2016 with a game that borrows assets from Unity and Syndicate. I think that in 2017, Ashraf Ismail and Ubi Montreal will debut an Arno-focused, Egypt-set sequel. Following that, Ubi Quebec will do a direct followup to Syndicate by taking the Frye twins/Henry Green to India. Then in 2019, Sofia will do a direct sequel to their 2016 game."

assassinscreed,3cyf5b,Valtari5,5,Sun Jul 12 13:53:54 2015 UTC,"I'd jump out of my chair if that happened. I love that guy.  I don't know what to expect. There are 2 ways to go about this:  First one, obviously a new Assassin's Creed. He wanted to do Ancient Egypt I believe. Darby also works on ""unannounced stuff"", according to his linkedin page. I'd be stoked to see those 2 and Jean Guesdon (creative director of AC4) work on another AC again.  The second one,  yeah, this one's just something I thought about months ago. After Black Flag's success, Ubisoft sent out surveys asking people if they'd like to have a new pirate IP. It makes sense to capitalize on Black Flag's success by making a new pirate IP and at the same time break off from the AC franchise. That way, you lose certain responsibilites (like historicaly accuracy) and have more freedom. We could fight the Kraken this time around, imagine it! It makes sense for people that worked on AC4 to work on a new pirate IP.  All we can do right now is to wait for E3 next year. If it's AC, it will surely get leaked a couple of months after Syndicate's release and then we'll see if it's Egypt or not. If it's a new pirate IP, it's probably going to be revealed at E3 as the last game of the conference to surprise people like Ubisoft has been doing the past few years."
assassinscreed,3cyf5b,Fatal-Feit,2,Sun Jul 12 00:28:35 2015 UTC,"For Honor was revealed first last E3, so who knows."
assassinscreed,3cyf5b,wotkay,2,Sun Jul 12 00:50:31 2015 UTC,A new pirate IP would not surprise me either... whatever the case I am a big fan of Ashraf too
assassinscreed,3cyf5b,greetingsfromcanada,3,Sun Jul 12 00:51:01 2015 UTC,Please be true. Black Flag was the last Assassins Creed game that I really enjoyed.
assassinscreed,3cyf5b,papa_smurphy,2,Mon Jul 13 07:53:18 2015 UTC,"Nope, looking at the dev times of Unity and Syndicate, Ashraf's project will debut in 2017."
assassinscreed,3cyf5b,smoha96,2,Sat Jul 11 22:54:31 2015 UTC,Syndicate was in development for 2 years... Ashraf's game being in 2016 actually seems a reasonable guess.. Black flag was 2 years too.. (building on ACIII engine).. ACB and ACR were two years each (AC II engine)..guess.. whenever there is a new engine...successive games take 2-3 years .. I believe.. (ACU new engine took almost 4 years)..With the engine already pushing ps4 and xbox one to its limit.. I wouldn't expect a new engine for the next game either...That being said.. What you say  is a possibility too
assassinscreed,3cyf5b,ThatOneChappy,4,Sat Jul 11 23:12:34 2015 UTC,"ACR was actually made in 11 months. But yeah, assuming his project is an AC game, it'll most likely be 2016 or 2017."
assassinscreed,3cyf5b,Fatal-Feit,4,Sat Jul 11 23:15:25 2015 UTC,revelations reused masyaf assets.. Constantinople had assets from AC 1 cities and Italian cities... No wonder they pulled it off..

assassinscreed,3cwmom,euricus,14,Sat Jul 11 14:41:35 2015 UTC,I really hope we get some outer city limits again. I seriously doubt it after Unity but I really miss frontier-esque environments and even the cool outer city stuff we saw in AC1-2. Adds some diversity and colour to the locations.
assassinscreed,3cwmom,kissehh_unbanned,6,Sat Jul 11 15:00:58 2015 UTC,"Well Syndicate looks to be much more colourful than Unity was, which I'm all for.

assassinscreed,3cy8xr,Filmesis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:56:11 2015 UTC,I have it on both. I got it on 360 before I got my one. I just picked up Black Flag on games with gold this past week. I have not had any real glitches or any sticks or anything. Do you have your Xbox in instant on mode because that could be part of it. A hard reset could fix it which is just holding the power button until it shuts off completely. Not sure if this really gives you any insight on what you want but it's what I got. I find Black Flag better on One because of how it looks and all the extra detail that wasn't on the  360.
assassinscreed,3cwl91,jacksaints,14,Sat Jul 11 11:52:27 2015 UTC,"2 reasons as to why start wearing the Armor in Seq 13:   pre-seq13 there are certain cutscenes in which Ezio has his hood down. That is not the case with Altair's Armor, the hood stays on. The final cutscene like that happens near the end of Seq 12. ; IMO he looks much better with the hood down during those. in ACB there is an unlockable mission that takes place during Seq13 and Ezio's wearing A's Armor during it."
assassinscreed,3cwl91,ThePreciseClimber,4,Sat Jul 11 12:41:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info.
assassinscreed,3cwl91,azinrill,4,Sat Jul 11 17:11:13 2015 UTC,"One important question is: did he ever pay a visit to Monteriggioni while in Venice? I always thought that first sequence in Forli implies that journey to Venice was somethin bigger and you don't just travel here back and forth. And so he probably stayed here whole time. If this is true, he couldn't obtain Armor until he get Venice Seals home.   Backtrip is through the Froli again (seq 12) and it is very nice hint from /u/ThePreciseClimber  that he still didn't had Armor at that time. As of wiki, 9 years (!) have passed until seq 13, so he might spend this time collecting remaining keys (if he didn't have it already).  It makes sense that after so much time away from home, Ezio was very excited about this thing and when finally he was able to wear it, it became his main outfit as you can see him in it all the way from seq 13 to ACB.  Also Armor came without these beautiful robes which are belived to be tailor-made for Ezio. I think making such robes is both expensive and time-consuming which is another hint that he obtained them durning his free-time between seq 12 and 13."

assassinscreed,3cwl91,AssassinG,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:36:28 2015 UTC,"From memory, the earliest you are able to able to obtain the Armor is S9 (that's when the last section of Venice unlocks). In lore, Ezio wore the armor from that point onward; at least until the events of ''Brotherhood''."

Edit: The person who ends up causing the schism could be Titus Salt: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Salt  A successful businessman during the industrial revolution (thus making him more likely to be a Templar) but one of the few who showed a genuine concern for his workers thus would become the source of conflict between Jacob who would think he should live because he's not exploiting the masses and Evie who would want him dead because he's a Templar.

He kinda moved to London, when we was sorta done with the Assassins, starting the family-life.  But he was still active as an assassin, but mainly just researching the First-Civ, traveld to a few temples around the globe, but most notably found clues about The Grand Temple. He just didn't do anything that had an memorable impact on London itself.  But i would love any kinds of references, connection between the games is the thing that makes the games awesome."

It's frankly the only thing that keeps me interested in this game."
assassinscreed,3cv3t8,Lwsrocks,6,Sat Jul 11 02:49:40 2015 UTC,"I have an idea of my own too, I think Jacob will be slowly be corrupted by the power he's adopted and Evie will have to stop him at some point and teach him how to be a true assassin."
assassinscreed,3cv3t8,MusteloGris,3,Sat Jul 11 02:51:39 2015 UTC,"That'd be a really brilliant bait and switch. Build him up as the reckless brute who barrels in and fucks shit up, build her up as the cool and collected 'embodiment of the creed,' only to pull the rug out from under us halfway through the game. When a new target arises, and the value of their death is questionable, Evie advocates for a leave-no-witnesses mass assault that could potentially result in several innocents dying. Jacob argues with her and has to try and stop her (as well as Henry) from pulling the trigger. He intercepts the assassination the only way he knows how- by calling The Rooks into action, and stopping Henry and Evie before they can reach their target.   In a dramatic confrontation, Jacob insists that what they plan to do is wrong, even if it is in line with the purposes of the Order. He implores them not the conflate the creed with the be-all end-all rules of existence, but to look inside themselves and see that they're about to take innocent lives without a second thought. Evie is headstrong and steadfast- she won't kill her brother, but she won't allow him to tell her what to do, either. Once it's clear that they are at an impasse, Jacob is forced to make a choice. Will he kill his own twin sister, just to save the lives of complete strangers? Or will he allow her to slaughter innocents?   Evie makes her move. Jacob tries to stop her, and Henry mistakes his motion as a sign that he's going to hurt Evie. Thinking quickly, Henry lunges, and stabs Jacob in the throat with his hidden blade. Evie staggers backward in shock, realizing that she's let this bickering cost her own brother his life. She stares, eyes wide open, mouth agape, at Henry, who is spitting out half-assed apologies in an attempt to get her back on track. The Rooks are furious- their boss is laying dead in the street. They all want to overwhelm and kill Henry for striking their boss down, but with Evie now technically their leader, they look to her.  Evie looks at The Rooks. She looks back at Henry, still pleading. She looks at her brother. With tears welling up in her eyes and a crack in her voice, she says, 'L...look lively, Rooks.' and gives them a nod. As she grapples up to the rooftop, The Rooks make their move on Henry. Rain pours down over dark London, and lighting thunders overhead, as Evie runs across the rooftops trying to distract herself from what has happened. Perhaps the loss of her brother only makes her more determined to put an end to the Templar's reign of terror over London. But perhaps it causes her to question the creed, and arrive at a new position..."

assassinscreed,3cv3t8,Trevastation,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:57:51 2015 UTC,"I had an idea a similar fashion, where Jacob and Evie fight over how they want to assassinate a target: Jacob's really brash with the plan, maybe a personal vendetta, while Evie's plan is more stealthy, but takes longer. During the mission, we play the first part as Jacob, then later as Evie. Jacob is fighting the target while we play as Evie, who gets into position and air assassinates the target. But the target quickly sees Evie, and at the last second while brawling with Jacob, he grabs him, turns him around, and uses him as a shield against Evie, meaning we accidentally air assassinate Jacob. We get the usual background after killing a major target, only talking to jacob while he slowly dies. They say their goodbyes, Jacob passes away, the target escapes, and we play as Evie the rest of the game.;"

Yes, they have some matching characters and organizations, but the actual events play out differently.  Sure, a guy named Aiden Pearce may exist in Assassin's Creed for all I know, and ditto for, say, a smartass named Shaun Hastings in Watch_Dogs. Does that mean they're exactly the same, and that the way things play out for a character match its counterpart between the two series? No.  There isn't much of a simpler way for anyone to put this. Ubisoft's said it themselves, they're just having some fun, and the two series aren't actually intertwined."

assassinscreed,3cuia0,McCracKenway,4,Fri Jul 10 21:53:26 2015 UTC,"I really like the setup and the art style, but some of that dialogue was borderline cringey."
assassinscreed,3cuia0,borgsaa,2,Fri Jul 10 23:09:33 2015 UTC,These videos are meant to inform people about the historical context of the game and show off a unique art style. I'd say it succeeded.
assassinscreed,3cuia0,TheCliffhangers,3,Sat Jul 11 01:57:42 2015 UTC,"Kind of feels like it's just a Victorian set batman with this. Maybe it was the art style, or the sound effect text, or the batarang grappling hook. Call me cynical, but I feel like I've seen this story a million times. Kind of losing the AC magic from what I can tell of Syndicate"
assassinscreed,3csvyn,Turul9,8,Fri Jul 10 14:35:58 2015 UTC,"A total of roughly 600 million dollars for the AC franchise alone.  Ubisoft nailed the timing.  Next-gen consoles just launched and needed AAA titles, plus the 900 series Nvidia cards launched too and Unity is heavily marketed as  one of the games that's supposed to show off the GTX 900 series' performance and Nvidia features.  Rogue was the final AC game for last gen and MC'd a Templar, plus it has AC 4's gameplay, all helped generate some huge buzz on it.  If Syndicate proved to be a quality game, and is technically sound on PC and consoles, probably they could arrive at the same amount of sales."
assassinscreed,3csvyn,blackcoffin90,3,Fri Jul 10 18:27:05 2015 UTC,"Wait, from launch to the end of 2014? Really? Bloody hell, maybe I don't have a real concept of how much games sell, but that's a lot of units to shift in a few months."
assassinscreed,3csvyn,Freddiegristwood,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:00:50 2015 UTC,That's impressive considering Unity was the first current gen ac game and Rogue wasn't marketed that much.
assassinscreed,3csvyn,NeoNugget,6,Fri Jul 10 17:51:03 2015 UTC,It kind of worries me. Like what if Ubisoft decideds it can still perform financially by putting out broken and undercooked games.

assassinscreed,3csvyn,greg225,2,Fri Jul 10 18:06:18 2015 UTC,I think blag flag was something different that appealed to a wider audience than unity or rogue did. alot of people got the game for the pirate and ship side of it rather than the assassins creed side.
assassinscreed,3cteyr,TheMcKnightMare,10,Fri Jul 10 17:02:55 2015 UTC,Maybe as an HD collection. I could see an Assassin's Creed: Desmond Saga HD Collection at some point in the future. Maybe in 2017 for the 10 Year anniversary.

assassinscreed,3cteyr,Bloodloon73,3,Sat Jul 11 01:44:11 2015 UTC,Yes.
assassinscreed,3cteyr,papa_smurphy,2,Sat Jul 11 03:08:12 2015 UTC,If anything there will be more than just one collection. Like what Square did Kingdom Hearts HD Remixes.
assassinscreed,3cteyr,ThePreciseClimber,4,Fri Jul 10 17:17:31 2015 UTC,"Dunno, there's quite a lot of them. Seven + a bunch of DLCs that would have to be on-disc as well. It's possible but not with the current yearly releases. Doesn't seem they have enough human resources for that.  Though the main reason for such a collection would be if the 7th gen servers were shut down and there was no way to get the DLCs. I really hate that the Complete Editions never had them on-disc, save for AC2."
assassinscreed,3cteyr,ThePreciseClimber,4,Fri Jul 10 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"Probably if Ubisoft needed some boost in revenue and sales, or like other guy said, an anniversary edition release."
assassinscreed,3cteyr,blackcoffin90,5,Fri Jul 10 18:49:39 2015 UTC,I think we can expect a remaster of the first one in 2016-17 or something. The other games aged really well tho.
assassinscreed,3cteyr,Filmesis,5,Fri Jul 10 20:49:59 2015 UTC,"That's why I like PC. You can play games even from 1984 on a 2015 PC.   That being said, if they re release the games with bigger cities and better overall graphics I might buy them again :)"
assassinscreed,3cteyr,Shouvanik,4,Fri Jul 10 17:26:15 2015 UTC,they wouldn't alter any of the games to make the cities bigger but they'd probably enhance the graphics as much as possible
assassinscreed,3cteyr,ya_dingus1,-3,Fri Jul 10 18:56:14 2015 UTC,The only downside is it like so much work to get any game from before 2005 to actually work.

The only problem is that the film is supposively set during the Spanish Inquisition, and the Original AC was during the crusades. Hell, they could do a small game like Rogue, release alongside the other 2016 AC, and act as a prequel to the film.  But I would see them re-releasing or remastering the first game."
assassinscreed,3cteyr,Trevastation,5,Fri Jul 10 18:43:20 2015 UTC,"Wait, it isn't an adaptation of the first game?  YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!"

And AC1 - Rogue are all on available for 360. Correct me if I'm wrong, but won't you be able to run ALL 360 games? If not, they will probably at least do it for some of the AC games."
assassinscreed,3cteyr,Entropic_Cookie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:47:36 2015 UTC,No. If any game needs this it's Rogue. Not the pre-AC4 games.

Desmond's bloodline happens to have a lot of Assassins that Desmond descended from. And the sixth sense?

assassinscreed,3cr70j,C_12,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:17:19 2015 UTC,"Ooh, tell us more. How did you  find out about the trading village if the exact location isn't known? Any other interesting fact about the place that might interest us?"
assassinscreed,3cr70j,GalakFyarr,3,Sat Jul 11 04:21:39 2015 UTC,"Well there's several ways we can find places that don't exist anymore. In this case, we have texts that mention the place (it was attacked by the Vikings several times), there's also old place-names or even street names that can refer to older places now gone.  So while the village has disappeared (it probably never really disappeared entirely - but names can change, and people move to where the economy flourishes, so once the village lost its trading function, it just slowly died out probably), there was always a suspicion as to where it was located.  Last year in October, an actual archaeological dig happened at the location where someone would build a new house (in France you're required to check for archaeology every time you build something). They found traces of an old road and ditches, which confirms the presence of at least something (yeah we wish we could just say CASE CLOSED! but that's rarely the case :p)  The idea is that we use geophysical prospections (which don't require actual digging, we just walk over fields with a machine) to locate more remains (the machine we use is mostly suitable to detect traces of building foundations, ditches, holes etc.) around the area.  A first prospection was done in Sept-Oct 2014, and now we continue this work while another group performs ""traditional"" archaeological prospections (which includes digging) to confirm the presence of things we identified with the machine (currently they made two trenches, one over a presume building and another over a presumed ditch.  This way we can concentrate efforts on places we think are more promising than others (otherwise we'd have to open trenches over the whole fields, which you can imagine ain't exactly something the farmers like to see)."

His intro where he is stealing back his watch after losing it at cards, and saying ""The world aint fair and this is France"" made me giggle.  Snarky bastard already like him.

I find this equality thing bullshit because the main argument is that females have terrible representation in media, which is completely false. There are so many games, movies, and TV shows in where there is a female protagonist being represented in a good way. The people (Tumblr) just want as a female protagonist just for the sake of being female, nothing else. And frankly, this pisses me off because I couldn't care less on the gender of my protagonist. If it's either male or female, I'm chill with it. I just hate the fact that they're pushing on specific gender. Like if suddenly people were like ""There need to be more male protagonists!"". It'd be complete bullshit. I believe what makes a character interesting is not they're gender, but who they are. Take Galina or Gavin for example.

The whole town is pretty educated.   there's no reason a male protagonist has to be the default either.   That was never my point. My point is that I get annoyed when someone claims they are interested in a protagonist just because they are a boy or girl. I said that in my reply before, did you read that? A character for me is defined by their actions and thoughts and so on. I couldn't care less on gender."
assassinscreed,3cqelm,AssassinG,2,Fri Jul 10 22:32:48 2015 UTC,"Media, politics, and religion don't ""lead to"" sexism, sexism exists and is most visible within   There are reasons to appreciate female characters, the most obvious of which is that women are underrepresented generally and its a step in the right direction to have a female character done well.   As to the rest of it: whatever. I going to stop before we get into deep discussions about your personal life."
assassinscreed,3cqelm,McCracKenway,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:02:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I don't appreciate female characters. I'm saying that just because a character a male or female, that doesn't mean that it will auto-interest. I appreciate all characters of race or gender, but I won't suddenly be: ""OMG, THIS CHARACTER IS RACE/GENDER, THEY ARE A VERY GOOD CHARACTER"". That is what I am against. What I am for is a character that is interesting, regardless of male or female. And as for women that are ""underrepresented"", that's not true. There are tons of games with women as lead characters that are interesting as hell. Tomb Raider, Bayonetta, Metroid, Portal, Mirror's Edge, Resident Evil, etc. And this isn't counting the series of the games. These are just female characters you can play as, I'm not including other games where you can choose your gender, the rest of the games in the series, and other main characters in the series. That's not also not including movies, books, and TV shows which also represent women in a really good way. Again, the point that I'm trying to prove is that liking a protagonist based purely on what race/gender they are is bad. You should like a protagonist based on their background, who they are, their motivations, actions, ideals, thoughts, and so on. If there is a character of a certain race/gender that you don't see often that you like, it's good to appreciate that. But automatically calling them a good character and being auto interested based only on their race/gender is wrong. Do you know why I am excited for this AC comic? Because it's bringing a new and original story with a supposedly new protagonist (or sort of new: Galina) in an interesting timeline, the Salem witch trials. Not because the protagonist is a women, bugger that. Do you know why I love Galina as a character in the AC universe? Not because she's a women, but because she's a fuckin' badass. Solely liking characters based on their race/gender is bad practice. Seriously. Makes you neglect all other personalities on their character. It's like if someone and went up to you and said: ""Out of all the interesting and complex characters in the AC universe, my favorite one is Connor."" ""Why? Is it because of his story arc, his struggles, what he had to faces, his tragedies and losses? Or is it because of what he fought for and how did it, how much of a badass he was?"" ""No, it's because he's a Native American."" ""Woah woah woah, slow down there for a second. You're telling me that of all the legitimate reasons you could've chosen for any character, you chose Connor solely because he's a Native American?!"" ""Yeah"". Now, doesn't that sound ridiculous to you? A character's race and gender and other stuff should add to their background as to who they are, where they come from, and what they have faced to make you truly appreciate them. Like their backstory, it should make them who they are (in a way), not completely take over and be the sole focus. It should be an adjective of the character, and sometimes, if the writers want, they should give the adjective an important meaning. Here's how the conversion about Connor should've gone down: ""Out of all the interesting and complex characters in the AC universe, my favorite one is Connor."" ""Why? Is it because of his story arc, his struggles, what he had to face, his tragedies and losses? Or is it because of what he fought for and how did it, how much of a badass he was?"" ""Kind of. You see, Connor was a Native American who grew up and faced a lifetime of struggle and challenge. My love for him doesn't stem just because he happens to be a Native American. It's adds to his backstory and everything he's faced, think of it as a sort of background to explain why he did what he did in some areas. As to his struggles he faced and trying to save his village, his heritage and who he is, etc. He lost his mother and his village burned down and was left scarred. All of this adds up to Connor's character with other details, which influences his actions, thoughts, personality, motivations, and so on, which makes his character interesting."" ""Wow, that's pretty neat. I was talking to a dude yesterday about a Connor, and he told me that he purely likes him just because he's a Native American."" ""What the hell was that dude smoking? Does he even understand anything about characters at all?"" ""I don't know man. Let's go play some AC."" ""Sweet.""  That is my little thing on the matter (Or big thing. It's a wall of text)."

assassinscreed,3cpoco,Lwsrocks,18,Thu Jul 9 19:49:38 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Europe and European history, I really think the series needs to head to another continent. Every time I see London in the Syndicate gameplay it just looks like a cleaned up Paris to me. It seems to lack diversity, which I think is crucial to the Assassin's Creed series and it being a yearly release. I loved getting to run around the AC city of my dreams with Paris, but I don't like the fact that the next city looks so similar that it doesn't seem any different. The variety of settings we've had over the years has been one of my favorite things that Assassin's Creed has to offer, and London just doesn't look like it sets itself apart like Venice, Istanbul, Boston, and Paris all do.  The number one thing I want to see in 2016 is a transition to either South America, Africa, or even Asia. Going to any of those three would be a big shift in the direction of the series and a change of scenery that I'm beginning to think the it needs. I think that if they used one of those settings along with a new gameplay element that fits the time period, then I think we could possibly see the series heading in much more positive direction."
assassinscreed,3cpoco,RustyNipples35,4,Thu Jul 9 20:17:13 2015 UTC,"I agree. I would really like to see a game set in an Asian city, be it India, Russia, or eastern Asia. I think if they took a year off from burning their mounds of cash, they could make a good game; if I were in charge (which I'm not, unfortunately), I would make a game that incorporates the Black Flag sea travel system with AC3's frontier + a city or two, and I would set it in southern Asia. Just a fantasy, and an opinion, but you get the idea. Something to wow us. But this won't happen because they would rather make a mediocre game every year than the next AC2 (a groundbreaking game). If AC were more like AAA games, I think a lot of people would be a lot happier with their titles, including myself, and they would probably make just as much, if not more money."
assassinscreed,3cpoco,doeslikecheesecake,5,Thu Jul 9 23:10:40 2015 UTC,"In all honesty I really don't think its a matter of the series needing a year off, but rather a problem of being unable to break free from the generic Assassin's Creed formula. AC4 was so highly regarded because it was different in terms of both gameplay and story. Unity's story was very similar to the pervious games and Syndicate seems, in my opinion, no different. I believe that if Ubisoft can make a game that steps outside the boundaries like Black Flag did, then we would have another fantastic game."
assassinscreed,3cpoco,RustyNipples35,8,Thu Jul 9 23:56:30 2015 UTC,"Gonna sound a little bit harsh here, but I'd rather see something new in 2016 specifically. Because if you ask me, Syndicate is probably THE AC that plays it safe the most. There's nothing groundbreaking about it. Just looks like a better version of Unity in London. With hats.  I don't want a trilogy just for the sake of having it. Break free from these unnecessary chains and open yourself up. We've had enough of these ""trilogies"", now is the best time to go crazy, more than ever. Because people are tired of the ""same old"" AC.   Go to a different continent, move further back in time, try to mix things up a bit, lose your shitty guns and let us have some cool weapons from that era. There are so many more possibilites in the distant past. What DEFINITELY needs to happen is a change of pace, and you are exactly getting that by going to a continent where you've never been before."
assassinscreed,3cpoco,Valtari5,2,Thu Jul 9 21:24:54 2015 UTC,"I think there's definitely a valid, fair, and understandable argument to be made for not having trilogies for the sake of it, and I might just agree. Perhaps it would be better to really change things up instead. But I will say this- I worry that if they actually did change things up every two years, we'd end up in a situation where we got a shitty, unfinished, unrefined game every two years. Their 'major franchise overhauls' have never been as successful as their iterative titles. AC2>AC1, AC4>AC3, etc. If ACS>ACU then I know I'd rather get a good game that plays it safe than a bad game that does a lot of new things."
assassinscreed,3cpoco,Valtari5,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:31:30 2015 UTC,"You are certainly right about that, I just think that for 2016 specifically we need something else. Syndicate isn't getting a lot of hype and I personally think it's not just because of Unity but also because of the setting. If we had gotten something like India, people would've been more interested I think. After 2016, we can go back to trilogies because if you ask me, AC is in a different position compared to the times of the Ezio and Kenway trilogy. Franchise fatigue hit harder than ever before, and Syndicate isn't doing a great job at hyping people up or even presenting itself as an interesting game. I've always thought that the setting really makes the AC games.  The thing we need to consider here is that these major franchise overhauls like you described them came with new engines. What I want is just a new setting, not a new engine to accompany it. It would be the first time in the series where we not only get a change of pace because of the setting, but also have an engine with wich Ubisoft already has experience with. I think that doing this has a lot of potential, since they can yet again focus on the game like they seem to be doing with Syndicate. Also consider the fact that Montreal now has a lot more time to experiement with stuff since Quebec is taking the lead this year.  Ubisoft Montreal + more time + new continent + existing engine?  Now that would be interesting, to say the least."
assassinscreed,3cpoco,Ghost_LeaderBG,6,Thu Jul 9 23:53:42 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly want to see the games take a year off in 2016. The AC movie will be coming out at the end of 2016,so people will be reminded of the franchise anyway."
assassinscreed,3cpoco,Ghost_LeaderBG,7,Thu Jul 9 20:24:47 2015 UTC,"From a business perspective, it'd actually be smarter to release a game next year because of the movie. If people who have never played those games before see and enjoy the movie, then they will definitely be more likely to purchase a new game. This is why a lot of big budget movies find it profitable to release shitty, half baked tie in games. The movie is more of an argument in favor of a new release than against, if you ask me."
assassinscreed,3cpoco,Ghost_LeaderBG,2,Thu Jul 9 20:33:18 2015 UTC,"Hm,that's a fair point and it definitely makes a lot of sense from a business perspective. My opinion was due to the franchise fatigue I'm starting to experience."

assassinscreed,3cpoco,MusteloGris,3,Thu Jul 9 22:05:59 2015 UTC,"In the vein of u/Lwsrocks' answer, here's what I'd do if I were you:  -play the Saboteur. Pretty good game for a break, has some ACR-type stealth and parkour  -play Dishonored  -play Shadows of Mordor  -when Dishonored 2 comes out, play that  -keep doing this (playing relatively independent stealth/parkour games), along with replaying your favorite AC games (that is to say, the Ezio trilogy + AC4 + ACFR and/or ACRo) until 2020; then, come back to the franchise. You'll have a boatload of content to look at, and even if it's all shit, at least there'll be a lot of shit, and some of it is bound to be different than the rest. Honestly, it's what I'm planning on doing after Syndicate (with the exception of ACC:Russia; I love Orelov)."
assassinscreed,3cpoco,UndeadBread,3,Fri Jul 10 00:07:25 2015 UTC,"I think I'll just stop playing AC. Honestly, it doesn't intrest me anymore.

assassinscreed,3cpoco,Miora,2,Fri Jul 10 20:06:43 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The quality of the series has been in a steady decline in my opinion and I would really love for them to take a couple of years to develop an awesome game with a great storyline.  Until the events of AC3, I was really hoping they would use the transition of AC3 to AC4 to segue into a game set mostly in the modern setting where you get to take down Abstergo as Desmond.  They keep disappointing me with the direction they've been taking."
assassinscreed,3cpoco,Eddy_Sc,2,Fri Jul 10 08:41:32 2015 UTC,Can't you just take a break? Nobody's forcing you to buy every AC game that comes out. You could very easily ignore the series for every two years.
assassinscreed,3cpoco,zen_mutiny,7,Thu Jul 9 23:29:16 2015 UTC,miora is right. Unity was boring. They recycled a lot of AC2's story and still made it boring. Ubi can't do anything right at the moment and the best thing for them to do is give AC a break and focus on some new IPs then come back to AC when they actually have something decent to give us
assassinscreed,3cpoco,Bloodloon73,8,Thu Jul 9 23:40:42 2015 UTC,But that's not going to improve the series.
assassinscreed,3cpoco,zen_mutiny,2,Thu Jul 9 23:35:06 2015 UTC,"I can't say. I seriously can't say.  Innovations can be good, but they can also be horrible, we'd have to wait and see what ""innovations"" they are bringing for me to tell if that was better than another iterative title. On the other hand, I loved Unity's urban environment and parkour mechanics, so I truly wouldn't mind seeing more of that, and I always have been a fan of AC precisely for the ""more of the same"" we get with new games, so any innovation has to be very good for me to say that innovating was definitely and easily way better than an iterative title."
assassinscreed,3cpoco,Bloodloon73,2,Thu Jul 9 19:54:42 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the Desmond Trilogy: AC1, ACII (and its sequels), and ACIII. It overlaps both the Ezio and Kenway trilogies.   In my personal opinion, it seems the second part of the trilogies seems to be their strongest suit -- this is the time that they don't have to put a lot of effort into assets because they did most of that in the first part, and they really focus on a good story, whereas the third part doesn't necessarily get as much attention, as it's mainly put out to placate fans as they work on the next big game. Second parts would include ACII, Brotherhood, Black Flag, and presumably, Syndicate.   However, I think Ubi would do well to break up this formula a bit. While it would be smart to make use of Unity's and Syndicate's amazing European assets, they leaned strongly towards a departure to Napoleonic Egypt in Unity. This has the potential to be a lot like Revalations and Rogue in that it wraps up a lot of storylines, while making a brief departure from business as usual. They could bring back naval combat, explore AC's huge yet unexplored potential for great battlefield combat, wrap up Napoleon's and Arno's story, as well as possibly focus on Arno's attempt to avenge his father's death at the hands of Shay. They could even bring in other characters -- Connor could lend his Aquila to the French Assassins' naval cause (much in the same way the French aided him during the American Revolution), and he could even bring Eseosa and Aveline along with him, likely after their own involvement in the Hatian Revolution. Play areas would include Cairo and perhaps other Egyptian cities, the Mediterranean Sea, and maybe some European battlefields and/or cities.  That would wrap up a European Trilogy, which I would promptly follow with an East Asian Trilogy:  Japan (Feudal or Meiji Restoration would work)  China (Medieval or Boxer Rebellion)  India (British Raj)  Not necessarily in that order.  Edit: added Brotherhood to the list of epic part twos."

assassinscreed,3cpoco,Bloodloon73,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:32:15 2015 UTC,"True, but Brotherhood does get the treatment of a full-blown, independent release. Either way, it's kind of the intersection of two trilogies -- it's Ezio's second part, and at the same time, it's the second part of Desmond's second part. In a way, it's more of a second part than any other AC. Even Empire Strikes Back doesn't have that kind of part two cred."

assassinscreed,3cqpbk,AssassinG,2,Fri Jul 10 22:18:57 2015 UTC,Well okay then. Just something to think about.
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,Treviso,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:20:30 2015 UTC,"Well, I suggest you buy from Steam then, due to the fact that you can get refunds on any game for almost every reason. This way, you can make sure you get your money's worth."
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,kw405,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:21:43 2015 UTC,"Well seeing as I paid 6$ for unity, no."
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,AssassinG,0,Fri Jul 10 01:30:24 2015 UTC,"Alright then. But seriously, Steam is super cheap, and if you don't like a game, you can get an insta-refund and buy one you like. It's the best option. That way, you have a net in case you make a bad investment."
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,Eddy_Sc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:49:57 2015 UTC,Unity had a pricedrop yesterday.
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,Fatal-Feit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:17:00 2015 UTC,Only for some regions. Still 59.99 for most of Asia
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,AmbitiousAchiever,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:37:14 2015 UTC,I don't know why you're acting like I don't know what Steam is.
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,Fatal-Feit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:06:41 2015 UTC,"No, it's just that the refund feature is new. Meaning safe investments any time."
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,AmbitiousAchiever,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:39:19 2015 UTC,"Happened to me a couple times too. It stopped happening over time though, so try pushing forward..."
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,Fatal-Feit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:30:52 2015 UTC,That happens often when you tinker with the settings and restart the game. Unity also has pretty bad draw distance to get used to that.
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,AmbitiousAchiever,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:16:56 2015 UTC,Out of VRAM?
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,Fatal-Feit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:33:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, but maybe.  SLi 970s."
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,AmbitiousAchiever,-2,Fri Jul 10 04:43:56 2015 UTC,set textures to high. 970 doesn't have enough VRAM for ultra textures
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,Fatal-Feit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:12:41 2015 UTC,Depends on the resolution your running. I'm running Ultra settings on a GTX750Ti and have none of these issues at all. I'm running native at 900p.
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,AmbitiousAchiever,-1,Fri Jul 10 05:29:28 2015 UTC,"That is weird because a 750 Ti only has 2GB of VRAM and even 900p exceeds the 2.5GB range. Anyway, I own the same card and 900p with ultra textures still passes the 3.5GB range.   Also, why was I downvoted?"
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,whitehusky,2,Fri Jul 10 06:40:26 2015 UTC,;) OC to the max. The trick is the memclock.
assassinscreed,3cqpbk,TheTalkingSandwich,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:36:58 2015 UTC,"whoa, 500+ mem overclock? u got an awesome card, bruh."
assassinscreed,3crqpy,armingips,3,Fri Jul 10 06:18:50 2015 UTC,"You haven't purchased it from Steam so it won't recognize it as one of your games, You'll have to create a shortcut to the Game if you like to be able to access it from Steam by following this tutorial, but it will still launch uPlay so you may as well just continuing accessing it from uPlay or your desktop."
assassinscreed,3crqpy,Callum1370,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:53:00 2015 UTC,"My Problem is, I lanched it from Uplay, but Uplay just opens Steam and goes to the Shop page."
assassinscreed,3crqpy,Treviso,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:02:40 2015 UTC,"Are you logged in into the right Uplay account? Otherwise contact Ubi Support, they do reply relatively quickly."
assassinscreed,3crqpy,Treviso,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:35:21 2015 UTC,"I am on the right account. When i open Uplay there are all the other games as well, also Unity. I press ""Play"" on Unity and it just opens Steam Shop page...  Okay, thanks i will try that"
assassinscreed,3crqpy,Treviso,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:39:11 2015 UTC,"Did you create a new Uplay account for your GF? Otherwise you simply added Unity to an account that already had the game, likely the steam version."
assassinscreed,3crqpy,Treviso,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:42:29 2015 UTC,"She had a Uplay account allready with AC2-AC4FreedomCry . I just added Unity to her account. And it is in her Uplay Library. Still if i press ""play"" it just goes to the Steam Shop page. I just uninstalled steam. Now it does nothing whenever i press ""play"""
assassinscreed,3cqstt,AssassinG,6,Fri Jul 10 01:00:23 2015 UTC,I bet 2016 will be when the sub explodes in popularity due to the AC movie.
assassinscreed,3cqstt,ThatOneChappy,2,Fri Jul 10 01:05:10 2015 UTC,"That's if the movie is good. Although, I have faith in the star studded cast."
assassinscreed,3cqstt,greetingsfromcanada,3,Fri Jul 10 01:07:06 2015 UTC,"The cast is really damn good, and the director is pretty good as well."
assassinscreed,3cqstt,Entropic_Cookie,2,Fri Jul 10 01:20:55 2015 UTC,But do not underestimate the importance of the writing.

assassinscreed,3cqstt,blackcoffin90,4,Fri Jul 10 11:41:41 2015 UTC,"I imagine once modern story is back on full swing, it'll probably give some excitement and more of the theories, I mean there were lot of good theory building here before AC Unity was launched, even a huge theory about how the Helix system works."
assassinscreed,3cqstt,ShenziSixaxis,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:51:32 2015 UTC,"I see this as a thing with AC in general no matter where it is. I only got into AC spring before AC3 and I really wish I had gotten into it sooner so I could experience the sheer, overwhelming enthusiasm the community had for it then. I mean, the few months after AC3 came out, and even up to a bit after AC4, was absolutely amazing and I wish I had been able to see it all myself."
