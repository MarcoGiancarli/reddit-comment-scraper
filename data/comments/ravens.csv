ravens,3e2ble,k_pasa,16,Tue Jul 21 12:25:04 2015 UTC,"Curious to see how Maxx/Gilmore play in preseason.... because I really want to draft Maxx Williams in fantasy and I can't tell if I'm being reasonable, or just a homer."
ravens,3e2ble,streetxmanifesto,4,Tue Jul 21 12:29:25 2015 UTC,"Bit of homer but he wouldn't be bad for a late round pick up for second TE, I feel. Its always hard to gauge rookies but I feel like he'll get some decent snaps this season."
ravens,3e2ble,womtei,4,Tue Jul 21 13:20:33 2015 UTC,Yeah my concern is the history of rookie TE's basically doing nothing their first year. Gronk is basically the only guy I can think of recently who was fantasy relevant during his rookie year.
ravens,3e2ble,workbelame,3,Tue Jul 21 13:24:23 2015 UTC,Especially Ravens rookie tight ends. Maybe by mid-season but I doubt we see much of him at the beginning.
ravens,3e2ble,doggyfur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:26:51 2015 UTC,"when I was drafting for fantasy when gronk was in his second year, I couldn't get any TEs that I wanted earlier and so I waited a few more rounds before I needed to draft a TE. Checked the stats of who was left and saw Hernandez and Gronk...went with the guy who got 10 tds. Turned out to be one of the best pickups ever in the later rounds of a draft.  Also, maybe a late round pick in Crockett Gillmore wouldn't be a bad idea instead of drafting Maxx Williams just because he's a rookie versus the 6'6'' 275 lb monster in Gillmore who contributed late in the year and that one TD in the playoffs."
ravens,3e2ble,workbelame,4,Tue Jul 21 20:44:20 2015 UTC,"Can anyone on here explain to me the details of his contract implications better? We signed him to a pretty large amount of guaranteed money right? So he gets that money whether he plays or not or does he have to show up for a certain amount of games? Wouldn't it just be best to place him on IR and let him rest, freeing up a roster spot? I mean we saw what happened when he tried to come back too fast last year."
ravens,3e2ble,IAmAnOutsider,4,Tue Jul 21 12:49:21 2015 UTC,"PUP list frees up a roster spot. PUP list is better, because you have to place someone on the PUP list before training camp begins, and the person on PUP is eligible for return at any point. If he stays on PUP during the whole preseason, then he can be on PUP for up to 11 weeks. At that point, the Ravens either have to activate him, or place him on IR.   PUP is like IR, except he can return if he gets healthy. If he gets placed on IR, then he's done."
ravens,3e2ble,workbelame,2,Tue Jul 21 17:01:34 2015 UTC,Ok that makes total sense.
ravens,3e2ble,IAmAnOutsider,3,Tue Jul 21 17:22:52 2015 UTC,He's getting his $4 mil guaranteed for this year even though he will not be playing the whole season. It just depends how much guaranteed money he is supposed to make in a season. And I feel ya on the IR situation.
ravens,3e2ble,madman19,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:53:36 2015 UTC,So what happens if he calls it quits/never comes back? Is his contract null and void?
ravens,3e2ble,Jurph,2,Tue Jul 21 12:54:57 2015 UTC,"I believe he would still get his guaranteed money in both circumstances. However, they would not have to pay his base salary for those years."
ravens,3e2ble,madman19,2,Tue Jul 21 14:50:30 2015 UTC,"If he retires, I believe the contract is null at that point and we don't owe him any more money. At this point he is not required to give back a percentage of his signing bonus (most people usually do - see chris borland on the 49ers) but I believe the Ravens could pursue legal action to get that money back if they wanted.   Any money we have paid him that hasn't been put towards the cap will still have to count to the cap either the current season or the following season depending on the timing of the retirement I believe."
ravens,3e2ble,410LaxMD,3,Tue Jul 21 17:19:21 2015 UTC,"His salary guarantees are for the first two years of his contract (2014 and 2015).  He was paid $1M guaranteed last year, and is due $4M guaranteed this year regardless of how many games he starts.  Presumably his out-year salary has an injury split built in which would reduce his cost to the team, since those years are not guaranteed.     He was given his signing bonus (~$11M) up front which was also guaranteed, so if he retires I don't think we can ask for the out-year bonuses back -- which means we're going to eat $6.6M over the next three years no matter what."
ravens,3e2ble,elusivetao,2,Tue Jul 21 13:29:26 2015 UTC,I believe players generally give back a % of their signing bonus if they fail to honor the full amount of the contract (see Chris Borland)

I have full trust in our coaches and front office to prepare this team to play without missing a beat as Pitta continues to rehab.

It's not a position I'm worried about, but any time you're counting on young, largely unproven players, to produce I don't think ""stacked"" is the right word haha  EDIT: I'm not saying I don't believe in Boyle and Maxx, but it's basically been proven TE is one of the most difficult transitions to make into the league as a rookie. You have to learn completely new blocking schemes AND route concepts. So I don't think it's going to be that smooth of a plug and play unless Maxx is the next coming of Gronk (which dear god I hope he is)"
ravens,3e2ble,KappaMcPussy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:25:51 2015 UTC,"Would you prefer me use the term deep? Regardless of what you want to hear, we've got 3-4 guys that are NFL-caliber football players fighting for the same spot on our team. If our #1 guy goes down I'm not sure I'm going to be sweating bullets.  Can we also be real with ourselves here? Dennis Pitta is not a freak of nature athlete by any means. He's a smart dude that finds the soft spots in coverage, but I don't think his a better athlete than, well, pretty much any of our other options at TE. That doesn't mean he's not better than those guys, but it does mean I'm confident in those guys stepping up to the plate.  Give it 3 months from now and you won't be missing Pitta that much. I mean, didn't Owen Daniels just fill in his spot pretty nicely last year? I think so."
ravens,3e2ble,tresanus,9,Tue Jul 21 13:21:38 2015 UTC,"As if Owen Daniels wasn't a largely proven commodity in the NFL? You talk about him as if he were chopped liver but he was as experienced and dependable as they come.  TE in this league is largely about concepts. Finding open holes in coverage, when to release off blocks, etc. Thus, there is a premium on EXPERIENCE, in addition to talent. Pitta has that. Daniels has that. Gilmore, Boyle, and Williams have talent. (Untested in the NFL talent, but talent nonetheless. ) What they need now is experience.  My two cents."
ravens,3e2ble,JohnnyRyde,2,Tue Jul 21 13:52:23 2015 UTC,"Pitta is my favorite dude on this team. Unfortunately, I don't see him playing as well as he had been ever again. It's gotta have some psychological effect."
ravens,3e2ble,ed2rummy,2,Tue Jul 21 12:54:22 2015 UTC,"Guys let's be honest here, did anyone expect him to comeback this early? He had 2 season ending injuries in the same place, and the second was without contact.  Crockett is good enough to be a starter, and Maxx can take Rockett's role from last year. We're good. At least I hope so."

ravens,3e2xqb,JohnnyBrillcream,7,Tue Jul 21 15:33:36 2015 UTC,"10   Joe Flacco | Baltimore Ravens   Average rating: 1.94 | Change in rating: +15.8%  2014 Rank: 12  Some question Flacco for the same reason they question Wilson. Both have played for teams with strong defenses and ground games, making their jobs easier. A GM who placed Flacco in the second tier said he could make a case for him as a 3, noting nearly identical career stat lines for Flacco and Andy Dalton in winning percentage, yards per attempt and passer rating. Their career Total QBR scores are also right around 53, just ahead of Ryan Tannehill.  A personnel director placed Flacco in the third tier, saying that Flacco has played his best games at the right times, and that he considered it more anomaly than a sign of Flacco possessing some sort of clutch gene.  ""That Super Bowl run had to do with his defense and Torrey Smith having a heckuva year making catches down the field, and Anquan Boldin making tough catches,"" this director said. ""They had the right combination of people around him. That is important for him. I don't see him as a guy who carries the team. I do not think he has the short accuracy. He has downfield arm strength, a big arm but not a great arm. I don't think personality-wise he is the leader of your team.""  A different personnel director called Flacco a strong 2, adding that Flacco is not good enough to transcend a system.  ""Gary Kubiak's offense was absolutely perfect for him -- strong run game, play-action throws, big windows, space in the pocket for him,"" this director said. ""This will be interesting with Marc Trestman taking over as coordinator. At the end of the day, Marc wants to throw the ball first and then run second. I know Marc is saying the right things, but that is interesting and we need to keep an eye on it.""  A defensive coordinator -- who ranked as the second-easiest grader overall by average rating -- placed Flacco in the top tier with nine others, pointing to arm strength and how well Flacco played last season. The vast majority put Flacco in the second tier.  ""Joe is a 2,"" a head coach said. ""He can't do it all, but he can do enough, and he doesn't do it every week. To me he is like Eli. He can go win the game."""

These QBs have padded up their resume with all sorts of career stats. Heck, I might even concede that Rothelisberger is possibly a better QB.suddenly realizes that his neck is exposed to potential divebombing Ravens.   What I disagree with is ""analysts"" and ""experts"" consistently ranking QBs like Luck (trending upwards but can be just as inconsistent as Flacco), Tannehill (of 8-8 fame), Stafford (Can't get it done despite having Mega-freakin-tron, recently Golden Tate AND that D), Cutler (B-Marsh,Alson J, Forte ... holy shit you gotta be kidding me) and Palmer (sneezes ""oh no I tore my ACL!"") above Flacco.

It is the crap that people hold against Joe Flacco except that only early on in Flacco's career has the defense been true.  It is more that the Raven's reputation for it is being held against him.  Worse yet even with mega talented receivers in Harvin and Tate, Russel was only putting up good not great numbers.  Its like the guy gets extra credit because he's short and a nice guy.

ravens,3e2ab6,Nevermore60,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:09:12 2015 UTC,"Well this is disappointing.  I was trying to grab a set of 3 and then resell my set of two that I already have, but the ""event limit"" is two tickets.  To add insult to injury, the ticketmaster map is disables, even though you can still click in and view it.  There are tons of single seats getting stranded all over the stadium, and there is a perfect group of three seats in the FRONT ROW of the upper deck that would be brilliant for me, but I can't get them because (a) I can't use the map, and (b) the ""event limit"" is 2 tickets.  What a bummer.  GOT EM!!!  They turned the map on and I took the risk and bought two at once and then went back to get the third in a separate order!  Yes!!!"
ravens,3e2ab6,yalemartin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:29:54 2015 UTC,"I looked at the tickets available, I looked at the price, and I just couldn't pull the trigger. Craigslist at 8am of a 1pm game is a fucking CLEARANCE SALE for tickets. I got two $150 club level tickets for $100/each last year. Face value certainly isn't a rip off, but you can do better if you are willing to do some legwork before a game."
ravens,3e2ab6,Nevermore60,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:56:15 2015 UTC,"Ticketmaster tickets are a better deal if you're buying for Steelers or primetime (which generally won't even be THAT cheap the day of), or if you use the map and get a great row.  I waited for the map to come alive and got upper-deck row-1 seats.  At $80 a pop including fees, I think that's a great deal.  Face value at most venues for some reason largely fails to account for the row of the tickets, so looking for good rows before the secondary market can be a winning strategy imo."

ravens,3dy41y,TweetPoster,3,Mon Jul 20 14:11:21 2015 UTC,Good news. I really want to see what the young guys can do and it's already a crowded position.
ravens,3dy41y,OsStrohsAndBohs,3,Mon Jul 20 15:23:14 2015 UTC,Good news. I really want to see what the young guys can do and it's already a crowded position.    Really? How is it crowded? We have steve smith and a bunch of unproven young players. Just because there happen to be 3-4 good rookie WRs last year doesnt mean it's a common thing. We need all the help we can get at the WR position
ravens,3dy41y,YoBroFreeBeerForBoY,2,Mon Jul 20 19:26:39 2015 UTC,"I think Perriman can come in and contribute immediately and I expect Aiken to continue his production as well. Toss in Maxx+and Buck Allen (Not to mention if Pitta comes back healthy) and we do have a bunch of talented dudes, gotta see what they can do. As much as I love Reggie Wayne, the guy is old and injury-prone and would be a waste of a roster spot at this point.  I do agree that beyond Smitty and Perriman our WRs are a toss-up, but adding Reggie Wayne would really be fruitless."
ravens,3dy41y,reedsgrayhair,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:37:00 2015 UTC,Perriman is unproven and has had trouble with drops in college. I am more confident in Aiken at this point which tells you about our depth. Our odds are better going with Wayne as opposed to hoping Aiken turns into TY Hilton imo
ravens,3dy41y,YoBroFreeBeerForBoY,2,Mon Jul 20 21:23:36 2015 UTC,"Reggie Wayne would just be another band-aid solution. I'm just tired of these 1 and 2 year contracts for veteran receivers on the back end of their careers. It's fine if we have one guy like that on the team at a time, but we either need to develop our own talent in-house, or we need to sign somebody long-term."
ravens,3dy41y,doggyfur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:55:11 2015 UTC,"It's crowded because we have a lot of guys fighting for spots. Just because they're unproven doesn't mean it's not a crowded position. Like I said, I would rather see if one of those young guys can step up and be productive than have their spot taken away by a 36 year old guy with his best years behind him."
ravens,3dy41y,OsStrohsAndBohs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:53:42 2015 UTC,No shit. This was a baseless rumor that provided nothing.
ravens,3dzjsu,Jaschndlr,6,Mon Jul 20 20:21:00 2015 UTC,"not really  Smitty is the only guaranteed starter rn  Perriman I expect will be the other one (big, fast, the hands are a big question mark but I think he can immediately jump into Torreys role, which is pretty simple so there wont be a huge rookie learning curve)  Aiken will play the slot, he proved himself in those last few games of the season last year imo- strong, decent speed and will compete for the ball. Campanaro puts up a good argument to be in the slot but hes constantly injured so who knows.  after that, meh. Everyone keeps spouting this shit about Marlon Brown but nah, that guy has done absolutely nothing that separates him or puts him above the other guys. I suspect the TEs and the RBs and even maybe Waller will pick up the rest of the receiving quota. Trestman loves utilizing those positions in the passing game anyway.  Honestly its wayyy too early to know, but we do have a ton of young offensive talent (which is a first for the Ravens) and that should be reason enough to be hype."
ravens,3dzjsu,reedsgrayhair,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:57:18 2015 UTC,Aiken is an excellent run blocker as well so I can see him rotating in as #2 depending on the personnel. He's also probably the best route runner on our team besides Smitty
ravens,3dzjsu,beyondwithinitself,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:47 2015 UTC,How you gonna pick Waller over Brown?
ravens,3dzjsu,SouloHigh,3,Tue Jul 21 17:37:57 2015 UTC,"There's no point in having young receivers with potential and never giving them a chance. We have them, we're gonna give them the chance to shine this year. Kamar aiken is one guy I was nothing but impressed with when he was on the field. He can play pretty well and had good chemistry with flacco, I expect him to have a much bigger role this year. Then you've got Perriman who is unproven sure, but so was every player ever when they were a rookie. We won't know until we see him play but he's got the speed and athletic ability, if he can get a good grasp of the playbook/routes he very well could light it up this year."
ravens,3dzjsu,Shmerkabowl,2,Mon Jul 20 23:01:05 2015 UTC,"I had the same thought the other day, even across all of our skill positions. To summarize:  a) Issues at WR which you've pointed out  b) A mystery at TE  c) A RB that doubled his previous season high (with 2nd year backups behind him)  d) A new OC on top of all this  I do think there is a lot of talent at these positions. I'm excited to see Perriman, Williams, et. al. come into their own, but I'm not sure if it's going to come together right away. We're counting on a lot of players that haven't done a lot in the NFL and I anticipate the offense to be choppy at times.   I think Ozzie will have his usual late-August pickups to offset the youth we have in these spots and hopefully we'll be hitting our stride in December."
ravens,3dzjsu,Shambloroni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:24:56 2015 UTC,"For some reason I'm not nearly as worried about TE and RB... Our O-Line is solid and Forsett is still only 29.  Taliaferro has looked really good in flashes.  We've got some talent at TE, even if Pitta can't play, and Trestman always seems to get production out of that position.  I hope you're right about the late August pickups... a few solid veterans mixed in with all these young guys at the skill positions would go a long way towards helping this team reach its potential."
ravens,3dzjsu,henly1,2,Tue Jul 21 14:08:45 2015 UTC,Don't sleep on Jeremy Butler.  Dude could possibly jump ahead of Marlon Brown by mid-season
ravens,3dzjsu,dopkick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:22:52 2015 UTC,"I think that IF our WRs can stay healthy (Campanaro) and IF they don't randomly suck (Brown) then we have a diverse set of average to slightly above average wide receivers that could be fairly productive if their strengths and talents are properly utilized. Steve Smith is the only guaranteed lock and the hope is that Perriman will be able to take a substantial number of snaps. Outside of those two, though, I don't know if any of our WRs are the kind you'd really want to see on the field for a substantial amount of time. They're great rotational and situational players at an excellent price."
ravens,3dzjsu,Ravensr0b,0,Tue Jul 21 10:54:05 2015 UTC,Logjam? Like when you poop and they won't go down the toilet. Besides Smith we have a rookie and a bunch of average backup receivers.

Now for me I am inside the ravens home market meaning when they are away the ravens have preference over the Steelers and eagles.  Then they play the Steelers once at home and if I'm lucky they may have a home prime time game and also if I'm lucky one of the locals will have them because it's a Steeler bye week while the ravens are at home or the Steelers are on prime time.  When it's all said and done I only usually have to worry about 5 games a year.

ravens,3dxzr5,RAVENS17d,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:35:05 2015 UTC,He wasn't bad last year. He is a decent coverage safety that had somewhat of a breakout season last year.
ravens,3dxzr5,RAVENS17d,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:57:35 2015 UTC,"I think Elam's ""skill set"" better compliments the type of SS we use. He is supposed to be the punishing run stopper. The FS is typically a more coverage centered guy, but over the last two years we have favored guys that are more balanced. Whoever doesn't get picked will still play a decent amount in special packages. Elam could be a useful box defender in certain packages."

Hell I even like guys like Bethea, Whitner, Gipson a little better then him. 2013 was with a different team and scheme so I would take that with a grain of salt. He just hasn't provided a consistent enough point yet for me. I never said he was going to be sitting behind Elam. What I said was that Elam fits the bill for a run stopper and that he would fit well inside the box in certain packages, meaning he isn't starting but instead maybe a nickel or dime defender. Hill will(lol) start, but I think his skill set is a better fit for FS then SS."
ravens,3dxzr5,outphase84,4,Mon Jul 20 20:21:40 2015 UTC,"I like Hill as much as the next guy but his production isn't on par with guys like Weddle, Thomas, Chancellor, Berry, McCourty.   By what metric?  Because every measurable statistic, he matches them.   He just hasn't provided a consistent enough point yet for me.    He has not had a poor game in his entire career thus far.  Not a single one.  He is beyond a model of consistency.  Furthermore, if you include the playoffs, PFF graded him as the #2 safety in the game this year, despite having missed 6 games for suspension."
ravens,3dxzr5,DorienG,2,Mon Jul 20 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"Warren Sapp used to say ""1 good year, you're lucky. 2 good years in a row, you're consistent. Three good years in a row, and you're a star."" Or something like that....   Hill did great last year, but let's not crown him just yet."
ravens,3dxzr5,RAVENS17d,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:30:57 2015 UTC,"Stats do not tell the whole story though. The most important test is the ye test. Does he seem to have the impact that Weddle, Thomas, Chancellor, and McCourty have? No. PFF grades how well they do certain things in their role, but its all opinion based. They dont measure big plays, it measures the fundamentals. Do you think Hill makes more big plays then any of those guys above?"
ravens,3dxzr5,outphase84,5,Mon Jul 20 21:55:24 2015 UTC,"...does a guy who was targeted 32 times in 800 snaps make a lot of big plays? Probably not. Guess Revis doesn't pass the eye test either?  He definitely looks better in game than Weddle, and you can't make a fair comparison with ET3 and Kam because that whole secondary is so stacked that they can take risks to make big plays. With our secondary or the Giants secondary, moving out of position to try to make a big play would have been suicide because he couldn't rely on anyone else. Not quite the same as having Sherman and Browner, or Revis and Chung."
ravens,3dxzr5,RAVENS17d,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:04:09 2015 UTC,"Well going off just stats, TJ Ward is a top 5 safety. In all reality there is so much that goes into a player. As someone who lives near NY I watch plenty of Giants games and in 2013 he wasn't even the best player back there. He was able to take chances in 2013 also with Rolle having an All-Pro season. His upside is aboslutely incredible, and I mean top 5 potential. But lets not jump the gun here he is not a top 5 safety right now. Also Revis did prove the eye test when he deflected 31 passes in the 2009 season along side 6 interceptions. So Revis proved it with an eye test. His 2011 season they tried again and he got 4 interceptions and 21 pass deflections. Revis was the fifth most targeted CB in 2009 and still was by far the best. Hill is still unproven in my eyes and it wont change until he has his break out season."
ravens,3dxzr5,Cheebasaur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:08:30 2015 UTC,Are you serious on McCourty? Dude hasn't been a Pro-Bowl caliber player in years. Had his second lowest total for INTs and Tackles and Forced fumbles. Overpaid safety
ravens,3dxzr5,RAVENS17d,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:33:16 2015 UTC,"McCourty is a very good safety, and may even be the best coverage safety in the NFL. McCourty is the Patriots secondary and he was before they rented Revis."
ravens,3dxzr5,Cheebasaur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:31:21 2015 UTC,Ooooooh stats burn.
ravens,3dxzr5,RAVENS17d,0,Tue Jul 21 13:38:43 2015 UTC,Dude he has Top 15 talent all over him. If you can't see that you're fucking blind.
ravens,3dxzr5,ed2rummy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:31:40 2015 UTC,I never said he wasn't top 15. I said he wasn't top 5 right now.
ravens,3dxzr5,EliteAsFuk,3,Tue Jul 21 11:28:38 2015 UTC,Will Hill is going to play both FS and SS this season. He is the only interchangeable piece. These are depth listings. Quite a few times Pees was changing Hill from FS to SS positions last season
ravens,3dxzr5,KarmaCollecting,2,Mon Jul 20 14:55:27 2015 UTC,"Everyone continues to make Elam a punch-line... But, he's first-round draft pick, third year player who has never had any continuity at his natural position. Let the kid play it out. He's not likely to beat out Hill for a starting job, but confidence is a funny thing. There are no guarantees in the NFL."
ravens,3dxzr5,410LaxMD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:33:23 2015 UTC,"If Elam wasn't a first-round pick, he wouldn't be competing for the starting job. Judging from OTAs, the SS competition does appear to be open, though. But I doubt that Elam wins it."
ravens,3dxzr5,TommyTrillfiger_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"Not much surprise here (except for Kendrick over Hill at FS). This really pushes Elam's hand when it comes to improvement, which is a great thing."
ravens,3dxzr5,PurplePain57,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:33:59 2015 UTC,I think Kendrick Lewis will be better than Darian Stewart. Just my opinion
ravens,3dxzr5,JanuaryJoe5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:33 2015 UTC,Lewis is a veteran who knows how to make adjustments to coverage based off of reads in the offense while Brooks is coming off of his rookie season in which he didn't play much and experience is important when playing free safety when there is limited experience in strong safety like what we have.
ravens,3dxzr5,ZGlaciatorZ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:58 2015 UTC,"If Ozzie is risking a comp pick for Kendrick Lewis, he should be good enough to start.   Any chance Hill and Elam split time?"
ravens,3dxzr5,MrCoolHand,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:24:13 2015 UTC,"In my eyes, not really a competition but the FO will give Elam all the chances to play."
ravens,3dxzr5,fadermango,2,Mon Jul 20 18:38:49 2015 UTC,There's no two ways about it -- the starting safeties for this team are Kendrick Lewis and Will Hill.
ravens,3dxzr5,MrCoolHand,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:49 2015 UTC,I don't see it realistically playing out another way.
ravens,3dxzr5,DangerousCurves27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:57:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly. That's not to say Elam will have no role on the team, but let's be real. Those are our top safeties, and they're the guys that will be out there."
ravens,3dxzr5,Cheebasaur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:15 2015 UTC,Elam needs to have the greatest preseason of all time to even make this a conversation.
ravens,3dykh0,HOLD_MY_POCKETS,4,Mon Jul 20 16:12:55 2015 UTC,"Ravens' single-game tickets available through Ticketmaster, team site or 410-547-SEAT  IT'S ALMOST TIME FOR FOOTBALL!"
ravens,3dykh0,yalemartin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:14:00 2015 UTC,These priced at face value or something?
ravens,3dykh0,banks29,3,Mon Jul 20 16:49:03 2015 UTC,Yup.  It will probably just be singles and nosebleeds though.
ravens,3dykh0,Nevermore60,3,Mon Jul 20 17:54:52 2015 UTC,I usually have a ~50% success rate.  Got two pairs of tickets last year.  Some years I've struck out though.
ravens,3dykh0,banks29,3,Mon Jul 20 19:17:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's definitely worth a shot.  Saves money if you can get lucky."
ravens,3dykh0,TweetPoster,0,Mon Jul 20 19:24:34 2015 UTC,"@Ravens:   2015-07-20 16:04:22 UTC  Get ready, #RavensNation. Single-game tickets go on sale tomorrow at 10am.     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]"
ravens,3e0bqr,windward83,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:48:15 2015 UTC,"To me no. We've had a history of bringing in aged receivers, handing them spots at the top of the depth chart and wondering why we never see development from the younger guys trapped at the bottom."
