This is the Book of Lokk.  The city of Kartos is a dark, cruel place, and its winding streets lie within the Black Temple’s great shadow. The Devout, the priests of the temple, rarely leave its towering walls, but when they do it is only to collect the dead or to lead the city’s condemned back to the dungeons.   And those who enter do not return."

In it, we highlight the work of poets, novelists, short story authors, essayists, photographers, and…well, a whole lot more.  In issue #4, we've got a lot of great stuff for you. For poetry, we have new works from Leopold Figaro, Carol Fulton, and W. L. Kasperek. For fiction, we've new works by Peter H. Salus (author the Gordy and Weena books) and master fabulist Robert Folkner. Also, something new this time—Belle Lettres, with contributions from Michael Jay Tucker and Jerry James McMurry.  Plus there's some great travel writing on hand. Issue #4 features sample chapters from Jennifer Crystal's fascinating tale of a year in Paris, Et Voilà: One Traveler's Journey from Foreigner to Francophile. Next up, Tristan Gans offers us a chapter from his enthralling meditation on Italy and its future, Stranieri: Life among Italy's Tourists, Expats, and Immigrants.  And we haven't even gotten to the photography. In this issue, we've got some terrific photos of the American Southwest by Martha Trudeau Tucker. That's paired with some truly striking work by that visual chronicler of the Pacific coast, DeWayne Fisher.  So download today! It's a great mix in a small package!"

Folkner, author of Something For Everything, come these tales of horror, sin, death, and dystopia. They include:  *Classical Massacre—somehow we avoided nuclear war in the 1960s. But what if we hadn't?  *Fortune-Baby—It was a perfect horror flick. Except the horror was horrifically real.  *Cracked and Broken Sidewalks—Sartre said that hell is other people. But, sometimes…  *Everyone Gets What He Deserves—It was a society too civilized to punish juvenile offenders with anything so gauche as death. What it offered was far, far worse.

Here's BERNIE the sentient software at his most ridiculous, Frisky the killer gerbil at her most terrifying, and the never failing Depth Charges.  But there's more! Here is Tucker writing as a doting if sometimes infuriated father, with his son in the title piece as a strikingly talented child actor. And, here too, we have heart-felt little portraits of home life, the lives and deaths of beloved pets, and movements of tenderness with family and friends…  Plus, we have something terrifying. Here Tucker gives an account of a fire that nearly claimed the lives of a family of close friends...  AND, we have Tucker as a intellectual. Here, for instance, we have his thoughts about the great comic Fred Allen, plus his impassioned defense of Nancy Drew and children's literature in general.  So, give this selections of Cargos a try. Frankly, we think it is among his best.  ~The Editors at B&B"
