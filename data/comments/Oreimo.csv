Oreimo,3e0mbt,scorchclaw,3,Tue Jul 21 01:15:00 2015 UTC,no kirino appearance? R.I.P in peace in pieces
Oreimo,3dvfmm,swampie2,7,Sun Jul 19 21:19:21 2015 UTC,"I've made a post like this a few months ago when I was new to Oreimo, and /u/Woowoo_Water gave me a pretty good summary.   UPDATE: Read the light novels if you really can't get over the series. Then watch DizzyZiddy's youtube videos on translated VN runs. (Ayase hnnnng...)  Oreimo kicked me into watching anime as my preferred medium of entertainment. Before that, maybe I'd watch one series, say Gundam, and not watch an anime series for months.  I'm into the whole incest thing Oreimo offered so I was still desperate for my next wincest fix. Slowly, my urges died down but I'm still enjoyed rom-com shenanigans, maybe some harems and Sword Art Online and Mahouka. This list will flow just as similarly. The first two are a must watch.   Yosuga no Sora   If you want to inject yourself with some H-level wincest straightaway, watch this. Fantasizing Kyousuke and Kirino crossing the line? Reading Doujins not enough? Want to see siblings fuck? Watch this. The wincest arc is the last few episodes, but it won't make sense at all if you don't watch from the start.   Kiss x Sis (especially the OVAs)   Watching this series, to be more preciese, 3 episodes out of the OVA season (not necessarily consective nor the first 3), got me out of my incest phase of Anime. Because damn, incestual fantasy scenarios ran full fucking throttle for this anime. After Kiss x Sis, you might question whether you're really into this incest trope. Time for regular rom coms.   Onee-chan ga Kita   Optional but is an adorable few minutes per episode series.   Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne! (OniAi) Sister blatantly likes her brother in this series. Not really to my liking though. It's on my On Hold list for some reason I don't remember. I think I never gotten into it. The LNs are... almost fully translated? Hm, I might give this a rewatch. Saikin Imouto no Yousu ga Chotto Okashiinda ga.   Non-blood related. Sibling possessed by spirit, requiring her to fall in love with aniki. An annoying recurring joke and weak plot (purely my opinion), might bore you in this series. I never gotten to finish it anyways. I'm not so sure about the Source Material.  (From this point, you can watch in any order. Depending on what you desire; what you want the anime to focus on. I'll give a heads up if the anime ends of inconclusively (i.e. read the raw LN/manga to continue. That sucks.))   Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (Romance, Drama, Comedy) (Open ending, Source LN untranslated, sequel highly unlikely) Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru (aka NouCome) (Romance, Comedy) (Open ending, Source LN untranslated, no sequel in sight) Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. (Romance, Drama, Comedy) (Open ending, Source LN untranslated, no sequel in sight) Hataraku Maou-sama! (Comedy, Romance) (Open ending, Source Manga/LN followup untranslated) Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de (Slice of Life, Comedy, Romance, Drama) (Open ending, Source LN untranslated) Tora Dora! (Romance, Drama) White Album 2 (Romance, Drama) Sankarea (Romance, Drama) (Source manga completed and translated) Nisekoi (Romance, Drama, Harem) (Source manga popular, translated, and ongoing) (WARNING. Plot development especially in Source is currently snails pace)   The following 3 are rom-com or romance deconstructions. If you are tired of this genre that you are beginning to be well versed in, these are enjoyable to watch as they subvert tropes.   Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. (aka Oregairu) (Drama, Romance, Comedy) (Source LN is fully up to date and translated.

Oreimo,3dvfmm,sagrado_corazon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:31:38 2015 UTC,"In the last episode, Sora goes into the lake and falls in. Haru jumps in after her and they both go under. As it shows them sinking, Haru loses consciousness and Sora doesn't know how to swim. Then he wakes up on the shore. Nobody was around to save them. Haru asks Sora if they're alive, and she doesn't answer. Then it shows their friends walking around their house and the camera peeks into the window. We see Sora's stuffed rabbit torn up on the ground. Then it cuts to the train, and Sora has her rabbit. So whether they lived or died has never been confirmed by the studio/writers, but it doesn't make sense that they lived."

Oreimo,3deccp,CokeFryChezbrgr,2,Thu Jul 16 02:15:41 2015 UTC,Where on earth do you guys get so many Kirino gifs xD I need these in my life
Oreimo,3deccp,Ankasammy,4,Thu Jul 16 02:34:50 2015 UTC,All these gifs
Oreimo,3deccp,Ankasammy,9,Thu Jul 16 03:45:48 2015 UTC,Well I finished it 4 months ago and my addiction has barely lessened.
Oreimo,3deccp,Haniasita,4,Wed Jul 15 21:37:24 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, so it's probably not going away anytime soon. So I should just let myself go to the addiction."
Oreimo,3deccp,Haniasita,2,Wed Jul 15 21:46:22 2015 UTC,I don't know about you but even if I could remove my addiction I wouldn't want to.
Oreimo,3deccp,Mayhzon,2,Thu Jul 16 11:47:14 2015 UTC,"Haha, honestly I would want to remove it either. The only thing the only thing that's a little dangerous to me right now is the desire to buy all the merch lol."
Oreimo,3deccp,AsianJustice,7,Thu Jul 16 19:20:46 2015 UTC,"I recall finishing Oreimo roughly 2 years ago. And you know what? I could barely bring myself to watch anything else since then. I hated the ending, but for some reason just couldn't stop watching the rest of the show over and over again to catch every single little detail I had previously missed.  Just let it grow. Hail Kirino until you can no more. Get sick of it, ignore Oreimo for a while, then wait for it to kick back in and enjoy it like never before.  Repeat.  I never actually considered Kirino like anything else than a show character, but for some reason I got really attached to her, much like many of us here.  Well, that's my story at least."
Oreimo,3deccp,darrius500,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:57:37 2015 UTC,"Wow, the anime I've ever wanted to re-watch was DBZ (huge nostalgia thing for me.) I think I've seen a pretty good number of different animes and while some were bad, some were good, but none have ever really made me want to re-watch them all that much. Oreimo is the first one in a very long time for me that makes me want to re-watch the entire thing again and again. So it's a very new feeling for me and I don't really know how to deal with it. As for the ending, it's a love-hate thing for me. Kirino has the complete win, which I love, and they may have a secret relationship, but it's not the ending I wanted (selfish I know.) I understand there were probably a lot of problems with the full-on incest ending, but I would love to at least see what happens next.  As for Kirino, she's been a very interesting character for me, but putting it simply, just like you said, I'm incredibly attached to her.  Also, give me that zen garden pls&thx"
Oreimo,3deccp,darrius500,3,Wed Jul 15 22:30:59 2015 UTC,"Haha, that zen garden was just a gift I received for Christmas. Not knowing what to do with it, I figured I'd just put Kirino there!"
Oreimo,3deccp,sagrado_corazon,2,Thu Jul 16 00:38:17 2015 UTC,"That's a hilarious zen garden, though. With that Buddha figurine (and that weird face expression of it) inside it looks like ""Buddha approves!"" :D"
Oreimo,3deccp,ImmaBeHokage,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:38:44 2015 UTC,"I've been wanting a zen garden for years. I just never had a good reason to get one. I might find something else and put Kirino's image in it, I don't want to just copy you lol."

Oreimo,3cw0ui,Lubok,5,Sat Jul 11 06:55:39 2015 UTC,"Far as I'm concerned, it's canon."
Oreimo,3cw0ui,terranq,5,Sat Jul 11 10:09:31 2015 UTC,Oh no doubt about that.
Oreimo,3cw0ui,Lubok,3,Sat Jul 11 10:17:58 2015 UTC,"Just finished the first four Volumes. I like how the doujin touches on both, erotic and deep emotional plot advancement. Not even lying, I liked the plot advancements more than the sexual content.  I hope they don't kick the 5th Volume off with a bad ending. This would break my heart. :<"
Oreimo,3cw0ui,Mayhzon,2,Fri Jul 17 18:58:52 2015 UTC,I hope they don't kick the 5th Volume off with a bad ending.   I'm sure the author remembers the feeling after watching the last anime episode and won't do something as cruel in his work.
Oreimo,3cw0ui,Lubok,3,Fri Jul 17 20:19:12 2015 UTC,"Judging by how the 4th Volume ends, I'm not so sure. It seems to take a turn for a dark route here. :<  I've seen a lot of bad endings over the last few days from the OreImu Visual Novel and I finished the Conquest ending of Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 2. I'm not sure I can take all that overflowing sadness. Well let's just hope you're right."
Oreimo,3cw0ui,Mayhzon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:24:53 2015 UTC,"Well I can't argue with the fact that it looks great, but I still can't bring myself to read it. I guess it's just kind of a mental block.  It's a shame though, I've been wanting to read that."
Oreimo,3cw0ui,CokeFryChezbrgr,6,Sat Jul 11 08:45:15 2015 UTC,"You should. Because it's awesome. Seriously, it's like if the official manga decided ""You know what, fuck it, we'll make it R-rated and show what actually happened."" Most people consider it canon. And for good reason."
Oreimo,3cw0ui,Wingzeroalchemist,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:51:29 2015 UTC,"Huh... Guess I'll force myself, then. Who knows, this might just help me get over this. Thanks a lot!"
Oreimo,3cw0ui,ImmaBeHokage,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:51:27 2015 UTC,"You could do what I do for that one, which is skim the text when it gets to heavy scenes, and only pay attention to the scenes and real dialogue when it gets less explicit. I feel much the same way about not being able to take seeing characters I feel attached to being in those situations. It also matters whether I see them as full adults or not."

Oreimo,3byb4l,PandaStyle,37,Fri Jul 3 03:59:33 2015 UTC,"I vote for just ignoring it. Being such a small subreddit, it really wouldn't make a big impact if it was privatized.

Oreimo,3avqvk,Onny1337,2,Wed Jun 24 16:31:45 2015 UTC,I mean wasnt kirito and leafy girl technically cousins?   Plus oreimo was actually a good anime.  Come at me.
Oreimo,3avqvk,scorchclaw,2,Thu Jun 25 02:06:27 2015 UTC,I didn't want to give away a detail like that in case anyone was planning on watching it but since they lived as brother and sister I thought it was close nuff
Oreimo,3avqvk,Mayhzon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:28:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe she is really just self-confident in the roles she plays and also accepts jobs in which she has to voice controversial characters.  After all it takes a considerable amount of bravery to play roles of characters that might be less popular or considered weird / taboo, since people will connect the actors/actresses in question with their corresponding roles."

Ruri's wish was that Kirino and Kyousuke get along and live happy together because they are the two most important people for her.

Oreimo,3a6vfd,Spartan448,2,Wed Jun 17 21:47:48 2015 UTC,"I think you're half-right. We know Ruri wanted Kyosuke and Kirino to get along better, and I think she knew that there was something between the two.   I definitely don't think though that anyone actually realized how strong tyne attraction between the two was. Ruri knew that by breaking up she'd be making a bit of a gamble but I think she thought it was a safe bet - she knew she had a Straight, but what she never expected was that Kirino had a Royal Flush."
Oreimo,3a6vfd,KuronekoFan,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:16:47 2015 UTC,You're right.   she never expected was that Kirino had a Royal Flush   But there some others things she actually expected http://i.minus.com/ibbBvyP8MZL9UX.gif

She can be inexplicably cute at times and then turn into her strong and decisive personality, on an instant. Ruri is the best girl IMO because Ruri is Ruri, don't tell me you guys (I'm looking at Kirino Lovers)  that you didn't like her character at least one bit.

Oreimo,3a629s,scorchclaw,4,Wed Jun 17 19:06:45 2015 UTC,"Kirino is borderline abusive with her brother. Frankly, my favorite part of the entire show was the OVA, because Kirino wasn't in it. She gets better in the second season, but I really can't find a reason to like her in the first. Her brother is a masochist for keeping on helping her after what she does to thank him."
Oreimo,3a629s,MaxRavenclaw,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:08:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly i can see where you're coming from with that. Half of me wants to say the harshness she shows is adorable, while the other half says I've never experienced an abusive relationship, so i don't feel im in a place to talk about it."
Oreimo,3a629s,scorchclaw,3,Fri Jun 19 21:19:47 2015 UTC,"the harshness she shows is adorable  I've never experienced an abusive relationship, so i don't feel im in a place to talk about it   That's the truth about most anime views that enjoy abusive tsunderes like Kirino, Taiga from Toradora! (don't get me wrong, I ultimately started to love her, but I actually dropped the show a couple of times because I just couldn't get over the first few episodes. I have a pal who still can't watch it because of Taiga's senseless violence, which is a pity, because it's a bloody great show and I loved it by the end) and Louise from Zero no Tsukaima, to name a few. They somehow find the abuse the tsundere does to her love interest amusing, or cute... but it really isn't. The shows are obviously not meant to be taken this seriously, and I'm definitely overthinking, but both Kyouske and Ryujiare classic examples of abuse victims. They both are dependent on their aggressor (Kyouske is in madly in love with his sister and Ryuji is just a really nice guy who can't get enough of Taiga because she's one of the few people who isn't afraid of him) and can't escape the abusive relationship. Sure, it's a story, so things get better, but what's painful is that in real life they don't.   Codependency is the tendency for the victim in an abusive relationship to develop dysfunctional patterns or habits in the process of trying to cope with a family member or partner who is abusive or neglectful or has an addiction. These patterns include denial of the problem, enabling or support of the abusive behavior, poor sense of self-worth, abandonment of personal goals or values and development of controlling or manipulative behaviors.   Again, I'm obviously taking this too seriously. The show wasn't meant to be interpreted like this, so we can all just agree they're all masochists :P  And then there's Watamote... I could only watch one episode... I think I would have committed suicide had I watched more. That poor, unfortunate girl.  EDIT: fixed typos"
Oreimo,3a629s,MaxRavenclaw,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:30:26 2015 UTC,"I was suggested watamote but never watched it, i heard it was pretty bad.   And yeah, we can get way too deep into a lot of animes like this, just reminds us they aren't real."
Oreimo,3a629s,scorchclaw,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:34:12 2015 UTC,"just reminds us they aren't real   Unfortunately, I can't always turn off my brain while watching an anime, so some things bother me, but that's mostly implausibilities. The worst offender so far is Aldnoah.Zero. The abusiveness, it's not as much as that I can't turn my brain off, it's just that it pisses me off. I'd like to reach through the screen and bitchslap the abusive tsundere bitches. Don't get me wrong, though, I love my healthy tsundere like Kagami and Rin. Even Shana is not so bad, even if she is the prototype of things like Louise and Taiga. Guess the prototypes are better than the things that come after. Gilgamesh was right."

Kyosuke says to the surprise of everybody  Both Kirino's and Ruri's eyes turn white and lock onto Kyosuke's  ""I- I know this will sound bad but I love you two the same!""  ""That's impossible!"" Both Ruri and Kirino said at the same time.  ""Loving us both the same is like not loving any of us at all!"" said Ruri with an angered tone.  ""A pervert like you deserves none of us!"" Kirino said as she papered to kick Kyosuke.  Kyosuke falls to the ground screaming in the agony only men know of gasping for air.  Angry, they both exit the room, not looking any reconciled, leaving Kyosuke on the ground. Recovering from the physical pain he just experienced, he lays there, trying to do the same for the situation he's in, staring at the ceiling he wonders what is it I truly feel?, as he takes out his cellphone and looks at the time, it's 11:32 pm. As he feels the urge to call Manami, the one who he's relied on during all these years, he remembers the events that happened previously, and feels incapable of asking for her advice, Ayase crosses his mind, but he can't call her either, suddenly he realizes, he has no one left, all this time he was there for everyone, to support them, to help them, and yet, here he is, alone, the two people he cared for the most are now gone, and there's no one he can talk to now. As he's thinking about all that, his cellphone rings, it's a mail from Saori.  ""Kyosuke-shi, I have been informed of the raging war between the three 'K' armies, however my informant asked for 'tis identity to not be disclosed.  Would you like to talk it over with me at my place?""  Oh, Saori-san could help me clear things up, but why would she want me to go to her house? , Kyosuke thought.  ""Your place?"" He texted back.  ""Indeed, see you here"" Saori replied.  Kyosuke lifted himself off the ground and opened the door, as soon as he opened it he found himself with:"

Said kyousuke nervously, if kirino or kuroneko saw him now it would only make things worse..  ""Huh? Aren't you glad to see me, you're lucky I took time out of my day to come visit you, be grateful!""  ""Yes, yes you honor me with your presence, now what is it you want? I'm kind if busy at the moment.""  ""W-why do you think I'd want something, can't I just visit you?...i thought you'd be happy to see me..""  ""Kanaka I-""  ""Hmph! Forget it it's not anything important!"" Kanako turned and briskly walked away leaving kyousuke alone once again.  ""Huh what's this ?"" Kyousuke picked up a folded piece of paper off the sidewalk. It was an invitation to kanakos celebration party for her new job. ""So she's going abroad to tour as meruru... sigh why didn't she say anything sooner, that idiot."" Kyousuke stuffs the invitation safely In his back pocket and continues on his way to saoris house."
Oreimo,392ok4,DaniSenpai,4,Mon Jun 8 20:37:19 2015 UTC,"The LNs go into much greater detail re: Kirino and Kyousuke's relationship. There is a lot of material cut from S2.   On the other hand, the anime focuses on Kuroneko a lot more. She is somewhat different in LNs (a lot more mean, verbally abusive to Kyousuke as much as to Kirino) and the LNs do not really set her up as a legitimate romantic rival to Kirino any more than Ayase, who for the record gets to even be a POV character.  Edit to clarify she's mean in LNs."

Oreimo,392ok4,thefran,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:27:32 2015 UTC,There is a Hinata POV focusing on Ruri. Also a whole spinoff manga from Kuroneko's POV called OreKou.

Oreimo,391ctm,timtamtitan,12,Mon Jun 8 15:16:00 2015 UTC,"No. The author laid as many hints as possible that they continued in secret. It's evident in the Light Novels, short story, and author interviews."
Oreimo,391ctm,Wingzeroalchemist,9,Mon Jun 8 15:22:48 2015 UTC,"This. Due to controversy and acceptable societal norms, the author couldn't well just go and say that the incestuous relationship just carried on out right. So he dropped as many hints as he could about it.  The game actually has an ending showing them together later in life."

Know your place!""  Then a second of silence passes and then she says ""W-well, I-I could make an exception if it's you.""  The perfect ending."
Oreimo,38xdgx,KuronekoFan,3,Mon Jun 8 03:09:40 2015 UTC,"Then a foot stomp is heard (and shown on screen), Kirino appears out of nowhere:   -Wait a minute! Are you already going back to her?!   -Ugh! Kirino, it's not what you think!"

Or does he stay with her?   Both choices start circling around his head as he struggles to make a decision. ""Did I hurt everyone for this? Did I come back to Ruri only to leave her again? Didn't Kirino and I accepted that we could never be together? So why...? Why am I doubting?"". Kyosuke thinks, as he starts to remember everything that happened, everyone  he left behind and the promise they made that this love could never be true."

""Y-You already know what you want"" said Ruri, almost crying.   Kyosuke tries to reach for her but he can't move further, with his eyes wide open he turns around once again and sees Kirino standing there."
Oreimo,38xdgx,DaniSenpai,3,Mon Jun 8 15:48:06 2015 UTC,"Tch! ""So you're gonna choose her over our promise?"" Kirino said as she clenched her fists and got her legs ready to kick Kyosuke in between his.  ""Kirino, I-""  Kyosuke hears Ruri on the other side of the room, she sounded as if she was starting to cry.  Ruri's spirit was starting to crumble, with her eyes welling up more with each passing second.  ""I..."" Kyosuke hesitates to say anything"
Oreimo,38xdgx,KuronekoFan,2,Mon Jun 8 16:18:25 2015 UTC,"""What?!"" Kirino yells, as silence takes over the room. Kyosuke constantly staring at both of them, unsure about what he should do next.   Kirino gets even angrier at Kyosuke's indecisiveness, but just as she's about to start yelling again, Ruri speaks:   ""I- I know we've had our disagreements, I always knew this was gonna happen"" -with her voice cracking, Ruri stops for a second, and then continues - ""b- but I just can't, I thought I could, but I can't just leave this be!""   Speechless, Kirino and Kyosuke stare at Ruri, with her arms against her chest, her face down and tears falling to the floor, she contines.   "" I- I...""   ""That's enough""- Kirino stops her"

Ruri looks surprised seeing Kirino talking so openly about the subject.  ""Our relationship is a near impossible one because... ""  ""Because?"" Ruri asks.  ""B-be-""  Ruri interupts her  ""You mean to say that after all of this, after going against every single principle, you are just going to give up?""  ""W-well...""  ""This isn't like you at all""  ""I love him okay?!"" Kirino says with her face changing drastically.  ""I just think he would be better with you than with me because you aren't his sister!""

He runs home, packs a suitcase and some money, stops by Ayase's house to pick up a knife on the way to the train station, then books a ticket to Nagasaki, where he changes his name, gets a comfortable civil servant job, and hangs the knife he got from Ayase in his living room as a reminder of how many hearts he'd broken.  Ruri, unable to take it, becomes a Zetsubou-sensei where suicide is in every other sentence she says, if she is even willing to talk. Hinata and Tamaki are concerned for their sister and have her checked into a mental institution.  Kirino is full of self-loathing for what she did to her best friend and brother, and moves to America to live with Ria, occasionally coming back to Japan where she bunks with Saori.  Five years after, in an effort to patch up with Ruri, Kyousuke writes her a letter at the asylum. She is found having hung herself in her room, with Kyousuke's letter open on her desk.

Edit: I'd also like to see a direct sequel to the second season, what happened with them? How did everyone else react to that ending? How did they move on with their lives? And how did everyone else did? If they did."
Oreimo,38xdgx,DaniSenpai,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:36:25 2015 UTC,I would also want to know how the rest react! The ending was kinda rushed and I was hoping for Ayase's reaction at least.
Oreimo,38xdgx,DaniSenpai,2,Mon Jun 8 09:43:54 2015 UTC,"I know! I was disappointed when I didn't see her! It's like they forgot about her! I mean, it's understandable that she wouldn't want to talk to Kyosuke or Kirino after her confession and all, but Kirino was her best friend and Kyosuke grew to be pretty close as well, it would only make sense that, even if her feelings were not mutual, she would still be concerned about them! Even more seeing how she despises incest throughout all two season."
Oreimo,38xdgx,DaniSenpai,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:27:31 2015 UTC,She might have been missing from the ending because she was too busy sharpening her knives though.

Can you imagine how it would affect the company's name, reputation and income if they just released an anime that claimed incest is good, normal and can be done with no regret? It'd be an international scandal bigger than anything we've seen"

Oreimo,385n1d,TheRealMavsZane,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:50:01 2015 UTC,that's pretty much the only I've been finding them.  Have a couple sets from various series ranging from 10-30 depending.

Oreimo,385n1d,Fuu-nyon,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:39:46 2015 UTC,"Official character TCG sleeves are often pretty expensive.  My friend picked up some Kamineko sleeves on ebay a while ago because some seller was having a sale, they were still 20+ dollars."
Oreimo,385n1d,Silentdt,2,Tue Jun 2 03:49:45 2015 UTC,Ouch. Why is the price so high? Are the prints really limited or something?
Oreimo,385n1d,Silentdt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:51:58 2015 UTC,Yes. They've also been over for 4 years on these particular sleeves.
Oreimo,385n1d,Silentdt,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:39:43 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, well I found a magical place and fond them for $9.19 that even offers free shipping... but it makes me wonder, is there such a thing as bootleg anime sleeves? xD The price seems just too low for it. (link if interested)"
Oreimo,385n1d,Silentdt,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:33:52 2015 UTC,"The price you saw on eBay is an unreasonable markup (pretty common for eBay), but even so $10 is like on the borderline of being suspiciously cheap. In my opinion it will probably be fine though. It would probably be pretty easy to bootleg sleeves, but I can't imagine someone actually doing it..."
Oreimo,385n1d,Bbfnn,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:00:19 2015 UTC,"Haha reading this is a bit of a relief, I take it sleeve counterfeiting is unheard of?"
Oreimo,385n1d,Silentdt,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:09:44 2015 UTC,I haven't heard of it. Doesn't mean it doesn't happen though. People do try to scam each other all the time. I've just never personally heard of anyone complaining of a counterfeit sleeve scam.
Oreimo,385n1d,Bbfnn,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:57:00 2015 UTC,"I'll report if these were/feel legit when I get them, since I had already ordered them. :)  RemindMe! 3 weeks ""Report Back!"""

I searched so many sites, after i saw amiami didnt have in stock... used to use them for my weiss deck, but now they are on the side as i build a PM deck to play with friends.. (got 2 signed kaminekos :D) but i think they are so high because its out of print? Like most other card sleeves... so i make sure when i order now from amiami, i get one to play with and one to store"
Oreimo,3801e3,AstroAustin,13,Sun May 31 21:07:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, because I am a weeb and it'd be a unique name"
Oreimo,3801e3,UsefulSpork,11,Mon Jun 1 02:41:53 2015 UTC,Maybe after I've named my first child Ruri :*
Oreimo,3801e3,Ankasammy,2,Mon Jun 1 16:31:42 2015 UTC,"You belong in /r/RURISQUAD, brother!"
Oreimo,3801e3,Cookieez__,3,Mon Jun 1 19:30:35 2015 UTC,"In Japanese a lot depends on the Kanji (chinese symbols/signs) that are used to write the name. Ayase in OreImo is spelled with the hiragana so just the syllable symbols (あやせ = ayase) which have no meaning besides the syllables they stand for ( あ=a, や=ya, せ=se).  That would mean that ""Ayase"" from OreImo has no meaning to it from the symbols. Hope that makes sense.  To answer your question: I actually thought of naming my (future) kid something like that and find that Ayase is a really pretty name and also not too hard to pronounce or too weird for non-japanese people (something I think is very important as I do not want my kids to be bullied or excluded or anything like that in school because they have a weird name)"
Oreimo,3801e3,Pl1xpl0x,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:30:18 2015 UTC,"Ah I see! I was thinking about it that same way, Choosing a name is one of the most important things that can affect a child's life. I really like it and am considering it because it would be pretty unique like you said."
Oreimo,3801e3,xamdou,17,Mon Jun 1 03:35:31 2015 UTC,No because I'm not a weeb and I'm white

Oreimo,37yiic,Fuu-nyon,3,Sun May 31 14:00:36 2015 UTC,What are these?
Oreimo,37yiic,DaniSenpai,5,Sun May 31 16:16:13 2015 UTC,"trading card sleeves! There's a card game that has Oreimo as one of the sets, and I'm hoping to eventually get into it and make a Kirino deck, then use these matching sleeves."
Oreimo,37yiic,DaniSenpai,3,Sun May 31 16:30:04 2015 UTC,Nice! What card game is that? What's it about?
Oreimo,37yiic,DaniSenpai,2,Sun May 31 18:12:56 2015 UTC,"It's called Precious Memories and it's an anime themed trading card game. I don't know too much about how it works, but I want to learn it just because they have an Oreimo set.  In the meantime I plan to use the sleeves for a different anime card game that I play called Weiss Schwarz."
Oreimo,37yiic,Bbfnn,3,Sun May 31 18:54:37 2015 UTC,"That's dedication, I guess.  It looks like it can be played online? Also, are there enough people around your area that would play this?"
Oreimo,37yiic,Bbfnn,1 point,Sun May 31 21:55:44 2015 UTC,No they're probably aren't people around here who play. For that matter though there aren't really any shops around here that play Weiss either. Most of the time I play Weiss with people via Skype.
Oreimo,37yiic,DaniSenpai,2,Mon Jun 1 01:16:02 2015 UTC,Do either Weiss or Prememo have english translated cards?
Oreimo,37yiic,DaniSenpai,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:30:12 2015 UTC,"Weiss does, but Prememo does not. Weiss has I think 14 sets out in English. Here is a list if you're curious."
Oreimo,37yiic,Forkii,2,Mon Jun 1 02:44:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much! I really want to get into both of them, I mean, it's anime on TCG form, what could be better? :D"
Oreimo,37yiic,sneaksnstuff,2,Tue Jun 2 01:27:49 2015 UTC,Combining two awesome things to yield yet another awesome thing. Works for me :P
Oreimo,37yiic,KuronekoFan,2,Tue Jun 2 05:22:02 2015 UTC,"Nice, thanks for the info.   I assume you have some way to find the card's translations? Or do you speak japanese?"
Oreimo,37yiic,KuronekoFan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:39:12 2015 UTC,They have a number of sets out in English. I have both English and Japanese cards. You can get translations for all of the Japanese sets at Heart of the Cards.
Oreimo,37yiic,KuronekoFan,2,Mon Jun 1 02:51:54 2015 UTC,"Nice, I see. I'll take a look when I have some time, thanks!"
Oreimo,37yiic,Forkii,3,Mon Jun 1 03:12:30 2015 UTC,"Oh look, another person like me who actually has Precious Memories.  I have the same sleeves (left) and 2 or 3 OreImo decks. One of them is actually a Kirino deck and it's pretty broken.  And for others asking if there is an online version of the game. A friend of mine and I started working on an online version of it quite some time ago but didn't end up finishing it at that time. But about a week ago he told me he is once again interested in finishing the game so if the game will ever get finished I can post it here.  Preview of the game"
Oreimo,37yiic,KuronekoFan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:17:41 2015 UTC,"That would be awesome. It would probably make it easier to get people interested in playing the game if there was an online version they could try before buying in too.  A guy has been trying to do the same thing with Weiss, but he's encountered a lot of difficulties. Thankfully the community has been awesome and provided him a lot of support for such a large undertaking."
Oreimo,37yiic,Forkii,2,Mon Jun 1 12:41:29 2015 UTC,"Nice! I just started playing Weiss Schwarz a few weeks ago, I was disappointed WS didn't have an oreimo set haha. How is Precious Memories? I love playing card and board games but I've never heard of it. Also what WS deck are you running? So far I've gotten the nisekoi and Kancolle trial decks and a Kancolle box but I'm not sure where I want to go from here."
Oreimo,37yiic,KuronekoFan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:33:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't actually played Precious Memories yet, but from what I understand it's somewhat more complicated than Weiss which sounds really cool to me. I'm going to be visiting a shop in a couple weeks where I hear there are a few guys who play it so I'm hoping to learn how to play then.  Welcome to Weiss! I play Phantom Requiem for the Phantom and Tantei Opera Milky Holmes in Japanese, and Bakemonogatari in English. I'm not too crazy about the series they have in English, but there are quite a few in Japanese that I want to get into eventually."

Oreimo,37k95o,DawnRun,4,Thu May 28 15:08:44 2015 UTC,"I don't really know. It seems like when I watch an anime and love it, the characters have some influence on myself. As if sometimes I would have the feeling to speak like one of them not on purpose or have the same tastes. So I don't know if I were a siscon (in anime only hey) before watch this anime or if it's just temporary because of this anime. But I think it would be REALLY hard to not become a siscon after watch this awesome anime."
Oreimo,37k95o,sneaksnstuff,8,Thu May 28 08:24:04 2015 UTC,"It is enjoyable to think about, until i remember my actual sisters, then it seems gross. Power to the incest couples though."
Oreimo,37k95o,sagrado_corazon,2,Thu May 28 14:58:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its' weird when I think about it IRL too. I don't have any real sisters though so I guess at least I don't have to worry there."
Oreimo,37k95o,Ankasammy,4,Thu May 28 15:08:29 2015 UTC,"Same here, I don't have a sister irl but I'm with you on the fictional siscon train. I never really analyzed my siscon-ness and you actually described it spot on. And also it's cool that we can share about this on here since I gotta keep it on the DL irl."
Oreimo,37k95o,BladeRegalia,0,Thu May 28 15:05:45 2015 UTC,"Dude, awesome. :) Can we be friends, haha.  It's so difficult to find people I can be like FUCK YEAH FICTIONAL INCEST IS COOL (and also sometimes really hot!!!).  I've mostly met incest-fans in super fetish communities where everything is like full-tilt hardcore sex all the time. And that's fine in context or occasionally, but sometimes I just wanna talk about how cute a little sister is or something without all the creepy over the top hardcore sexual baggage the fetish community sometimes has.  THis place seems a lot more... friendly? Like I feel I could actually make friends here whereas the fetish community just feels like people (usually dudes in their 50s+) looking to get off."

I'm mostly talking about fetlife.com... which by its very name is obviously going to be chock full of fetishes.  /r/incest has a lot too, but I guess at least I'm mildly interested in them all in general due to the incest part, whereas once you remove incest from the equation most fetishes are squicks for me... and even some with incest are squicks, lol.  Also TIL there is an /r/imouto, brb subbing to a new place... maybe..."
Oreimo,37k95o,stonecaster,3,Thu May 28 16:00:22 2015 UTC,"Definitely Siscon but that's biased since I'm attracted to females. But as with the rest of you I have no intention of practicing it IRL, even though I have three cute younger sisters.  I love joking about it though. My friends and I have a lot of running jokes about this subject.  Also I'm a huge fan of it in fiction (who could've guessed lol) because of all the drama it brings prime example being the Oreimo fanfic I always recommend"
Oreimo,37k95o,Meganezuki,1 point,Thu May 28 21:46:35 2015 UTC,"In some ways I'm glad I don't have a younger sister so that if people find out they wouldn't assume anything about me. But I've had people in the past assume it means I wanna fuck my mom, or marry a girl and sexually abuse our kids... which I don't get.  It's a sexual roleplay fetish for me, not something I want in real life.  And thanks for the fic recommendation, I'll check it out."
Oreimo,37k95o,OniichanBoo,3,Thu May 28 23:57:47 2015 UTC,I'm a Siscon but only in anime. In real life I haven't spoken with my sister for 5 years...

Oreimo,37k95o,CokeFryChezbrgr,2,Sat May 30 01:44:45 2015 UTC,this is where I would put my imouto    IF I HAD ONE
Oreimo,37k95o,OniichanBoo,2,Wed Jun 3 03:30:33 2015 UTC,"OP, I can relate to that. I don't have a sister (no siblings at all, I'm the only child) so I have no idea of how it feels. However, as time goes by, I feel more and more curiosity while some anime keep triggering this interest in me (which already existed.)   It makes me wonder and fantasize about having a sister and taking care of her, because there is an emotional void in my life (no siblings, rather old parents for my age, and cousins living far away.) and you know, friends or even a girlfriend are not the same. A sister is irreplaceable."
Oreimo,37k95o,OniichanBoo,2,Sun Jun 14 01:35:49 2015 UTC,"I keep ""Oniichan"" in all my usernames, and even though I don't have a little sister... the role-playing thing has been a fantasy of mine since I was a little kid. I have no shame and don't hide it in the least... Even the music I listen to is the #TeamImouto type shit. Don't judge me."

I know ""Imouto"" is little sister, and that ""Team Whatever"" is a Twilight type reference... I think. But I dunno what constitutes ""TeamImouto"" music.  But trust me, I won't judge. I'm so happy to find normal(ish) people into this stuff.  My experience has mostly been fetish communities where people are just... way hardcore and over-the-top sexual, which is fine in small doses, but sometimes I just want a friend I can flail about cute little sisters to."
Oreimo,37k95o,Fuu-nyon,1 point,Thu May 28 15:08:06 2015 UTC,"I replied to someone else with examples, but there's dozens of rappers (and musicians, producers, etc) who identify with being Siscons and into most the otaku/siscon/senpai stuff and use that #TeamImouto as a tag (on youtube, twitter, etc.)   A lot of it is fairly good (considering you're talking about non-professionals -- compared to most fan-based music tributes, i had much worse expectations, lol) and I get a kick out of listening to them talk about a lot of my favorite shows/characters.   I've been a huge fan of the imouto stuff since the 90s. I flail about it to all my friends (who don't like it, and would prefer I never mentioned it in the first place, I'm sure!)   You can see the hashtag used in instrumentals like KillingSpree's ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oexdt-dBuOM ) and other of Shiki's works ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ3c-argkRo ) or the other videos I linked to in my other comment.

Oreimo,37k95o,KisukeUraharaHat,1 point,Thu May 28 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks dude, I appreciate the info! It's funny because I'm so hugely into the imouto thing (I have a hardcore porn incest tumblr with 50,000 followers, for example) and Star Wars (Luke/Leia) back in like the 80s/90s was my gateway into the realm of imouto love... but I've kind of only recently gotten into the anime side of it. And it's GREAT! There's so much!  I've watched a lot of the hardcore incest anime, but I really like some of these ""softer"" ones where they can explore the relationships vs. just straight up going into sex. Are there any others out there like OreImo?  I've seen the Sora no Yosuba (I think is the name) and a couple others... but somehow I'd never seen/heard of OreImo until like two weeks ago, so maybe there are more Imouto anime like it out there that are somehow flying under my radar too...  A couple of my friends know I kind of like incest-y things and tease me about it, but none of them know how hardcore I am actually into it... haha. I'd rather keep it that way... But it makes finding friends into this a lot more difficult. So I'm very glad to find this place!  If you've been into imouto stuff since the 90s does that mean you're in your late 20s/30s?"

Oreimo,37efnp,FliryVorru,2,Wed May 27 01:26:01 2015 UTC,It's called 雪猫の冬 by the artist EdogawaKid. The artist's page is definitely NSFW.
Oreimo,37h4uz,royalsiblings,14,Wed May 27 16:24:41 2015 UTC,"I disagree. In part because I like Kirino and take her ""bitchiness"" as her coming to terms with feelings she knows are forbidden. But I also dislike the concept of Ruri actually being Kyousuke's younger sister because I feel it takes away from the parts about her that I thought were special, her being a caring older sister. Her ""Queen of Noghtmares"" bit didn't appeal to me because it's awkward and makes me embarrassed for her, but being a caring older sibling who takes care of her siblings when their parents aren't home and balancing her otaku activities with her sibling responsibilities is such a beautiful part of her character that it seems like a crime to discard it."
Oreimo,37h4uz,Wingzeroalchemist,1 point,Wed May 27 17:19:00 2015 UTC,"That's a good point.  I wouldn't want to take that away from her either. I guess I'm envisioning some magical world where both could exist, like... I dunno she was adopted out when she was young, or is a secret love child or maybe all of them are Kyousuke's sister's and she's just the oldest of the girls, etc.  I agree that her ""Queen of the Nightmares"" stuff was embarrassing, and I'd be embarrassed a bit to go out with her in her gothlic lolita clothing... but it was still not as bad to me as Kirino's obnoxiousness.  I thought Kirino would cool off after she and Kyousuke kind of came to terms about stuff, but she was still saying stuff like ""creep"" and ""pervert"" and ""die"" and ""I hate you"" etc after all of that.  Just makes no sense to me."
Oreimo,37h4uz,Wingzeroalchemist,2,Thu May 28 02:12:57 2015 UTC,"I guess the only thing I can say for Kirino is that old habits are hard to break, and even confronting her feelings for her brother and dating him doesn't mean that she's worked through them all yet. You can logically acknowledge and understand your feelings but not actual have come to terms with them emotionally."
Oreimo,37h4uz,Ankasammy,1 point,Thu May 28 03:53:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess that's a good point. And is also part of a reason why a season three would be nice, to show them both growing together.

Oreimo,37fv40,autowikiabot,1 point,Wed May 27 10:34:13 2015 UTC,"Akimi Sakurai (from Oreimo wikia):       At first, when Kyousuke talks about her in his flashback, she is a hikikomori  who is too lazy to go to school. She was shown to be smart, getting good grades even when not attending school. She liked playing games and making fun of Kyousuke. Eventually she became more outgoing and was more open to hanging out with people and made friends. Three years later, when Kyousuke met her again, she didn't seem to change much, and was still in love with him and regretted not apologizing to him during all the years they were apart. When she found out that Kyousuke was dating his little sister, she at first got jealous and wanted to take Kyousuke for herself, though when she realized that Kyousuke chose Kirino over her, she was willing to accept it and was willing to get along with Kyousuke.

Because even while he was still the ""prodigy"" he started growing up and away from Kirino like normal older siblings do. Whether that distance would have still been enough for the Westermarck effect to not take place is up for debate. I do think that Kirino would still be an otaku though, just maybe not so into eroge."

That Amazon listing is for a set of all 8 individual JP Blu-ray releases in one pack. Not sure if it includes the limited edition box to hold all the cases in or not, though.  The Blu-rays will work in the Americas, as Japan shares the common A region. However, none of these releases will have any subs (let alone English ones), nor foreign dubbed tracks. If that doesn't daunt you, order away you lucky collector ;-)  The Season 1 Blu-ray Boxset was a common release between Japan and North America. That's why the English subtitles were included, and why it is so darn expensive... It's literally a US-release, Japanese-priced, released in both markets. Likely due to poor sales (I wonder why... /s), no S2 Blu-ray Boxset has been released yet."

Oreimo,36gzyy,Ankasammy,1 point,Tue May 19 13:21:18 2015 UTC,Is there any way to enter the game from one of those blue circles or does everything depend on tactical savepoints to complete several choices (without re-doing everything from the beginning)?

Oreimo,36ehey,CookiieMoonsta,1 point,Tue May 19 06:58:33 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/XAkvRLE As you can see, oreimo game has 2 discs (my iso is called disc one) and, apparently, different routes (I didn't know about that till now)."
Oreimo,36ehey,DizzyZiddy,2,Tue May 19 07:49:46 2015 UTC,"Disc 2 is the continuation to Disc 1, which (bizarrely) contains some routes that are completely new while others continue from where Disc 1 left off.  For example,  Disc 2 Kirino Route starts after Disc 1's IF Dere Kirino Ending. Disc 2 Kuroneko Route starts after Disc 1's Kuroneko Ending.  And so on!"

Oreimo,368tpk,omgutukmycat,4,Sun May 17 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"You can get a game called love plus, really similar to this one. Essentially you have to make a girl fall in love with you by raising stats and talking to them and stuff. Once you start dating, you'll have to schedule dates and actually play the game at the specific time you set. It's pretty fun but can definitely get annoying when Nene-chan gets pissed because you didn't send her a Goodnight text."
Oreimo,368tpk,omgutukmycat,1 point,Sun May 17 16:41:44 2015 UTC,"I read a little about it and I'm impressed, some men date with there virtual girlfriend since 4, 5 years. I didn't think it was as much addictive as in the anime ! But it hasn't been released outside japan right ?"
Oreimo,368tpk,Zeathin,3,Sun May 17 17:51:45 2015 UTC,"You can't buy it, but you can easily download an English rom. Just search for love plus English and you can find the fan translation. I had a DS emulator on my phone so it was really convenient, otherwise you can do it on your computer or get an r4 chip but I have no idea how great those work anymore"
Oreimo,368tpk,roflollies,1 point,Sun May 17 18:08:53 2015 UTC,...aar I've tried to install an emulator on my phone but it seems to be just too old. Well I'll try on my computer !
Oreimo,368tpk,Yoshikoo,1 point,Sun May 17 20:19:32 2015 UTC,Hahaha tried to play it with a DS emulator on psp. It seem it wasn't  a good idea.
Oreimo,368tpk,DizzyZiddy,5,Mon May 18 16:10:08 2015 UTC,If I remember correctly there's like a dating thing coming for the vita this fall(?). I just remember it reminding me of that and that the only news is japanese-only at this point.
Oreimo,368tpk,azn6138,2,Sun May 17 07:55:36 2015 UTC,I think it's based of off Love Plus.  It's fun :>

Oreimo,3615pd,GottlobFrege,15,Fri May 15 05:43:45 2015 UTC,Thanks to Dizzy Ziddy and his crew I am playing the Oreimo PSP game. In this route you play the Sis x Sis game with Rinko-chan and Miyabi-chan. So I am playing a siscon game within a siscon game. I guess the next logical step is to show this to my sister in real life.
Oreimo,3615pd,sagrado_corazon,15,Fri May 15 05:44:46 2015 UTC,If you play with your sister make sure to post results ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Oreimo,3615pd,Erihoto,5,Fri May 15 10:49:35 2015 UTC,"That could be called the ""if - irl route"". Tell us if you success, I'm curious about the ending."
Oreimo,3615pd,CokeFryChezbrgr,9,Fri May 15 11:54:12 2015 UTC,"Yo dawg, we heard you like little sister games  So we put a little sister game in your little sister game so you can play a little sister game while you play a little sister game  But ya, I started playing the PSP game but the whole ""Kirino lost her memory"" thing, along with the little minigames that I have no clue how to do, made me just put it down."
Oreimo,3615pd,ImmaBeHokage,3,Fri May 15 06:27:03 2015 UTC,"I just completed that amnesia route yesterday, and the endings are lackluster. I read that there is a Kirino ""if"" route that has a much much more satisfying end, along with the Ayase and Kuroneko routes being satisfying as well.  I suggest looking at this walkthrough here. If you are using the PSP emulator on Android like I am, I suggest:  1) saving a lot.  2) ordering your saves so you can branch off several routes from the same save.  3) choose Kirino, always choose Kirino.  Edit I: because of infidel /u/DaniSenpai, slight changes had to be made."

Oreimo,3615pd,Erihoto,2,Fri May 15 21:45:02 2015 UTC,You can also use quick loads when you just do a mistake and want to go back quickly. Oh and I can't believe I thought when I saved for the first time that 60 savedatas would be enough.
Oreimo,3615pd,DaniSenpai,0,Fri May 15 21:50:47 2015 UTC,"You misspelled Ayase   Edit: /u/ImmaBeHokage yes, make it more visible, so everyone knows she's superior"
Oreimo,3615pd,Erihoto,1 point,Sat May 16 00:07:14 2015 UTC,The routes of Ayase and Kuroneko are more interesting. The routes that you unlock by doing the Akagi's route 3 times is very funny too. By minigames you talk about the twoshot dialogues ?

Oreimo,35zxgx,trambe25,3,Thu May 14 23:28:15 2015 UTC,"Don't know the number, but the one where Ayase confesses her feelings.  When Kyosuke tells Ayase that it's all his and that he forces Kirino to watch all that.   Kyosuke and Kirino's ""date"" when she needs material for her novel"
Oreimo,35ucmi,Erihoto,3,Wed May 13 16:08:47 2015 UTC,"On the bright side, the other Kirino-centric routes are really entertaining.  Her main route in Disc 1 felt really cliche honestly."

Oreimo,35ucmi,Spartan448,1 point,Thu May 14 01:34:09 2015 UTC,"It did feel really silly at first, but to be honest, I really came to enjoy it. It was almost like reliving the Oreimo experience with a different person, despite the obvious circumstances.  Plus, I think it has a better effect on the comedy, e.g. Kirino's first exposure to Kuroneko/Saori, her first learning of some of the less savory things she/Kyousuke did, and etc."

Oreimo,35pacq,Fissie,2,Tue May 12 22:04:59 2015 UTC,"Personally I feel it's enough to know that the author wanted the full frontal incest ending but editors can't accept that for moral reasons which the majority believes, and that's how reality is currently, so not much to do about it"
Oreimo,35pacq,BlackOdder,3,Fri May 22 15:05:58 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. I've seen the stuff about how the author really wanted it to end, but I still feel disappointed. It could just be that I don't have any more of it to watch, though."

Oreimo,34kot8,Pl1xpl0x,1 point,Sun May 3 19:32:48 2015 UTC,It's a grand strategy game where you play as a medieval ruler and try to build your dynasty. There are thousands of historical characters you can pick or you can make your own.  When you die you continue playing as your heir. 'Game over' happens when you lose all your land or your dynasty goes extinct. You can choose who you and your family members marry and sometimes you want to 'keep it in the family' so to speak ;)

Oreimo,34aac5,grifter600,6,Wed Apr 29 19:08:30 2015 UTC,I would have preferred it to end differently like everyone else here.  But in general I enjoyed the direction that the show took. I don't think I could have handled a second season of the same jokes and tropes. It was nice to change things up a bit.

Oreimo,34aac5,sagrado_corazon,8,Thu Apr 30 06:50:32 2015 UTC,"But the show was always about Kirino x Kyousuke, it was heavily implied from the very beginning."
Oreimo,34aac5,8works,2,Wed Apr 29 20:55:09 2015 UTC,"It had a lot of otaku shenanigans in it, like the main group of girls being otakus of different kind, or the whole episode of Kirino staying at home (was this 11)?  S2 was more centered on their romantic relationship."

Oreimo,34aac5,GottlobFrege,2,Thu Apr 30 03:21:00 2015 UTC,I really prefer the anime the way it turned out but an extra OreImo slice of life would make me the happiest motherfucker on earth now that you mention that.
Oreimo,34aac5,KusonagiKuroi,1 point,Fri May 1 03:09:46 2015 UTC,"Yes. I honestly though that the show was about her struggling to do the things she enjoyed while balancing the normal parts of her life that she also enjoyed. And it was great to see two siblings reconcile and become close friends, especially in anime since they often pull the romance card to some degree. Then s2 happens and I feel it ruins the potential s1 had. I think more otaku shenanigans leading to Kirino becoming more self dependant in her otaku needs while also having a great friend in her brother would've been an awesome way to go. (Kirino is my favorite but I ship kyosuke x ruri)"
Oreimo,34aac5,DaniSenpai,3,Thu Apr 30 13:13:57 2015 UTC,"At the end of season two she was still doing something she loved even though society would shun her for it. Except that thing was dating her brother instead of playing eroge, which was even harder!"

The ""good end"" is pretty much that : it leaves thing in a good way, a good atmosphere, etc.  I personally liked the true end more. It's sadder but... Without it, you don't get the fun climax at the end of the S1OVAs. Also, the true ending seems to be more like Kirino to me. Someone who'd pursue her dreams to humiliate her Aniki as the better athlete over staying home for no real reason other than it makes the audience happy. Overall, I'd say my reaction to the true ending => bittersweet. The good ending leaves a better taste in your mouth, but it's like the abridged end for S1 and I'd prefer the original. :)!"
Oreimo,33nxu7,OniichanBoo,2,Fri Apr 24 04:58:10 2015 UTC,"True Route was a retcon to allow the Kuroneko OVAs and S2 to happen.  If it wasn't retconned, the plot of S2 would raise even more questions with the audience."

Oreimo,33mg1o,Ankasammy,2,Thu Apr 23 19:23:12 2015 UTC,"I looked around and this is what I found, is it the one? I would say it takes place after the OVAs in season 2 for a couple of reasons:  Spoilers alert!   Kyousuke and Saori talk about more people attending their circle (never happens in the anime) Ruri said she made a friend in her new school (she just moved there in the anime) Kirino looks at Kyousuke when speaking of her love life implying they are (or were) a couple. (That happens first in the OVAs) Kirino clearly doesn't want Ruri to speak about what might have happened between her and Kyousuke on that sunday. (Must have been something that could easily be interpreted in a very intimate way. The only such situation I can think of in the anime is their night at the hotel and the wedding in the OVAs and this story is after that day)."
Oreimo,33mg1o,Ankasammy,2,Thu Apr 23 20:06:38 2015 UTC,Yes that is the one. Thank you. What was the after story you were thinking of? Was it fan written?
Oreimo,33mg1o,Ankasammy,2,Thu Apr 23 20:45:35 2015 UTC,It is a short story bundled with (I think) special editions of season 1 on DVD/Blue-ray and thereby considered canon I guess. I don't know if it has been translated to english.  I've heard it is about Kirino and Tamaki meeting ten years after Oreimo to watch the remake of Meruru. It doesn't contain anything at all about the other characters nor info about relationships from the little I have found out.

Oreimo,33dmxw,DIGGYReddit,2,Tue Apr 21 23:25:35 2015 UTC,Kinda wish there was a clearer copy too. But this isn't half bad for a phone cam/goPro  edit I did find this though: http://www.reddit.com/r/porterrobinson/comments/30pvdd/porters_possible_editremix_of_claris_irony_form/

Oreimo,33dmxw,DIGGYReddit,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:56:10 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it, it's really good quality audio (worth cleaning up, if only I knew how), considering the bass doesn't just blow it away.  I originally listed to it on my $3 desktop speakers, but as soon as I put my IEMs in, it sounded much better."
Oreimo,33dmxw,scorchclaw,2,Wed Apr 22 02:09:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm ganna see what I can't do to it today, problem is it's very loud and you can't hear the music over it."

Oreimo,337nru,xamdou,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:53:07 2015 UTC,"At the end of season one was the good end where Kirino never went to America and stayed with Kyousuke.  There were OVA's for seasons one and two.  For both you can watch online illegally or buy the show online in physical form which will include the episodes on the discs.  I won't spoil anything but the OVA's of season one are the true end of the season.  Kirino leaves and this is where Kyousuke does his own thing and Kuroneko becomes a bigger deal than before.  Then that leads to season two, which is also why in some episodes of season two there are flashbacks that the viewer won't recognize unless they viewed the OVA's.  After the flashback episode of season two are the series ending OVA's which take place after the ending to Ayase's episode.  Those I really can't talk about cause it'll all be spoilers pretty much.  They were streamed on crunchyroll for a limited amount of time around September last year (edit: 2013*) I believe and then they were taken off the site since it was a premier event.  Now you'll have to watch it online or buy the DVDs online and watch the episodes through disc.  Hope this helped and gives you info on getting getting the full scoop on how the show ended"

They might be slightly different or they might not."

Guilty Gear looks like something worth trying for sure. How is its Loli/Moe content? That is the big deal, of course. I went to look up Magical Battle Festa to see if the price was worth it on Steam and discovered that I seem to have acquired it in a Humble Bundle and didn't even notice. Great job, me >_> Installing now. Thanks for the help, everyone."
Oreimo,32z1az,xamdou,2,Wed Apr 22 03:47:51 2015 UTC,"Bit late, but Guilty Gear is a little lacking in the Loli/Moe  Guilty Gear is practically based around metal and rock music but characters like Bridget (loli trap) and May (loli Japanese) exist.  Dizzy is also a really cool character from previous games, she's sort-of half-robot half-human.   Baiken is like Najenda from Akame ga Kill, tough but cute.  In Xrd, you have May, Elphelt, Ramlethal, and Millia for cutesy things. May is just adorable, Elphelt has a VERY interesting story wink wink, Ram is adorable because she wants to kill you, Millia is a witch."

Oreimo,3208z6,CokeFryChezbrgr,4,Thu Apr 9 16:35:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion, and the warning on the content. Generally i don't mind about content, it's just finding the time to watch it."
Oreimo,3208z6,Potatomesh,3,Thu Apr 9 17:23:50 2015 UTC,"Oh gawd, I loved Yosuga No Sora, but it left me with an empty feeling, the way they made the scenery and the ending of it, it was an amazing watch, don't get me wrong, but the way they portray a lot of things.  ANYWAYS I DIGRESS, Yosuga no Sora is kind of episodic, so you probably should research the episode list."
Oreimo,3208z6,sneaksnstuff,4,Fri Apr 10 09:17:16 2015 UTC,"I also recommend Yosuga no Sora, I went in expecting just imouto fanservice but I was really impressed by the plot, and I was also impressed by the plot. It's overall a different mood than oreimo, the story is dramatic and emotional. The omnibus format was really interesting and well executed as well. 10/10 highly recommended."

Oreimo,3208z6,TonightsWhiteKnight,2,Thu Apr 9 20:09:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe I am biased since she is identical to my wife, in physical appearance and her tsuntsun."
Oreimo,3208z6,Potatomesh,2,Thu Apr 9 20:26:28 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more.  I dropped that anime at episode 18 (only got to 18 because my friend was bothering me for so long)  but it was the last straw when certain events came around.  Well, to each their own, Kirino will always be in my heart a lot better than Taiga, that being sad, a majority of people will be better than Taiga in my heart."
Oreimo,3208z6,INSiiGHT,6,Fri Apr 10 09:19:33 2015 UTC,I highly recommend The Pet Girl of Sakurasou. I saw it recommended in a similar thread a while a go and I can say it did more than just fill the hole oreimo left.

Ok, but nothing else.   Tsundere: Zero louise no tsukaima, the same voice as Taiga,   I bet there are tons more, but I can't remember any atm, sorry"

Oreimo,31zodi,Linkyoshi90,4,Thu Apr 9 12:26:55 2015 UTC,So what is this exactly?
Oreimo,31zodi,Pl1xpl0x,4,Thu Apr 9 13:49:43 2015 UTC,"Oreimo iP is the discontinued clock app with Live2D Kirino / Kuroneko (DLC) / Ayase (DLC). You get to buy outfits for them too!  Made for iOS and Android to promote the Oreimo PSP games, but pulled quite some time ago and the Restore Purchases option has stopped working too.  Tapping the onscreen character will lead to responses, sometimes they ask you questions and you get to pick from 3 answers.  During certain events, they have special dialogue related to the event (e.g. Valentine's, Comiket, Christmas). Experiencing these will log it in a Memories section where you get to replay them at any time and experience the 2 other choices you didn't pick.  And you can also set an alarm so the chosen character will wake you up.  A couple of videos I've done on it can be found here!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPQUKkoKT2M https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqQXtC6OuH8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ua7gnFtT-s"

Oreimo,31ng1z,1337jace,3,Mon Apr 6 23:08:46 2015 UTC,"Kuroneko is best girl. If we are comparing best chunibyo, she beats Rikka by a land slide (shots were fired)"
Oreimo,31ng1z,CokeFryChezbrgr,4,Tue Apr 7 02:40:42 2015 UTC,Oh god I never compared them before and now idk who I like better. Probably Rikka. /sorry.
Oreimo,31ng1z,xdeviousx,3,Tue Apr 7 07:39:38 2015 UTC,"Oh my god u did not just say that Kuroneko beats Rikka, did you? I mean, Kuroneko is way in there with the chuunibyou with her talk and stuff, but even the smallest battle between Rikka and Tooka beats (sadly) every battle in OreImo in my opinion.  Well, I like both :D"
Oreimo,31ng1z,penguingun,3,Tue Apr 7 11:31:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly I prefer Kuroneko for 2 reasons. The first is the way she treats other people, especially her sisters. Sure she I a jerk to Kirino, but they do this out of friendship. Second, I love her chunibyo (Is that what you'd say?). She acts so entertaining due to her chunibyo that I prefer her to Rikka. All my own opinion, didnt mean to cause a riot"

Oreimo,30sjtk,BladeRegalia,9,Mon Mar 30 10:13:14 2015 UTC,"i'm sure everyone here has finished, but just to be safe   [SPOILERS]  people don't really hate kirino, they hate the fact that kyousuke chose kirino in the end and they just blame it on her for being a selfish bitch or something when really she pretty much flat out told kyousuke he was a jackass for picking her? but regardless yeah it's what the other person said, people are mostly just mad from seeing kyousuke shoot so many girls down for his sister. and to add onto that, they didn't actually even stay together, so that pissed people off too.   but i agree, while i think all the girls are great, something about kirino makes her my fave"
Oreimo,30sjtk,ectotechnician,5,Mon Mar 30 11:32:25 2015 UTC,"Only to be legit with the publisher, We all know that the original intend of the author is full incest!  :D"

Oreimo,30sjtk,youeventrying,12,Sun Apr 5 16:38:12 2015 UTC,"To be honest? It's a running gag to hate her. When I shittalk Kirino, its just because I think it's funny how everyone hates her. I don't actually hate her, it's just fun to play along.  That said, Kirino is not best girl. Ayase or Ruri are the two potential best girls."
Oreimo,30sjtk,Deepified,1 point,Mon Mar 30 12:07:01 2015 UTC,"If it wasn't Kirino, It would have been Ruri 100% for best girl!  1st:  Ruri is tiny and hot 2nd:  Ruri is sweet and shy 3rd: Ruri would have bang him straight away since there not sibblings,  If the sisters where not in the house in that episode. Im sure Kyousuke would have join her in the shower..."
Oreimo,30sjtk,jcmyrand,3,Wed Apr 1 06:22:24 2015 UTC,"I only hated her mostly because of the unnecessary aggression toward Kyousuke and in many places where the context was clear yet she somehow snaps at him in misunderstanding.  ::SPOILER!!!::  Just as an example; the part where Kyousuke gets a box shipped to him from Saori and Kirino rushes down stairs and just takes the box FROM HIM, runs back up stairs, and then chaos ensues over the box where it should've been obvious to her that something was up and yet, she still gave chase after Kyousuke takes it back trying to help her save face with her friends."
Oreimo,30sjtk,DahjerCanaan,12,Fri Apr 10 23:33:12 2015 UTC,"Most people are just really butthurt over the fact that she won at the end instead of Ruri. Basically, a lot of people have shit taste.   With that said, Kirino best girl...by far...and it's not even close."
Oreimo,30sjtk,sagrado_corazon,15,Mon Mar 30 11:00:08 2015 UTC,I mean it was pretty obvious she was gonna win. I mean look at the fucking name of the series. I would've been amazed if she didn't win.
Oreimo,30sjtk,rokthemonkey,4,Mon Mar 30 11:41:50 2015 UTC,"Funny how whenever I bring that up, people downvote me to oblivion but don't argue back."
Oreimo,30sjtk,CokeFryChezbrgr,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:39:25 2015 UTC,To be honest I didn't expect her to win based on the title of the series.  But by the end of season 1 it was pretty obvious for me . But I guess thats also something that doesn't fit into the hate train since it seems many people hate her for the  180° turn ending which I just did not see like that.
Oreimo,30sjtk,konohasaiyajin,13,Thu Apr 2 08:19:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this.  While I Ruri is obviously best girl (#RURISQUAD), I do not hate Kirino, I just find her a bit annoying."
Oreimo,30sjtk,Fissie,15,Mon Mar 30 11:31:51 2015 UTC,"Same here, I'm really not a fan of tsunderes like her but anyone with a brain can see that the ending was not Kirino's fault, but Kyousuke's.  Kyousuke worst girl."
Oreimo,30sjtk,Beastlymurder,5,Mon Mar 30 11:41:34 2015 UTC,Kyousuke is mai waifu don't shittalk her.

Oreimo,30sjtk,sagrado_corazon,5,Tue Mar 31 11:15:22 2015 UTC,"Right. Also, to clarify, my preference of Kirino as best girl does not mean I hate any of the other girls (except for Manami of course)."
Oreimo,30sjtk,jcmyrand,3,Mon Mar 30 13:18:10 2015 UTC,Manami is indeed a cunt!
Oreimo,30sjtk,jcmyrand,4,Wed Apr 1 02:17:48 2015 UTC,Ok now I understand but I still get angry how other people hate her or any tsundere for that matter. I love Tsundere's. I could watch any anime as long as it has Tsundere in it.
Oreimo,30sjtk,Phuqs,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:08:12 2015 UTC,"I too see ALOT of hate on J-list, FB, Youtube, Tumblr on Kirino, and her Baka... It seems most people are just angry for her bitchy attitude, but thats what I like about her. She can be terribly bitchy and the next thing, she will be the ABSOLUTE CUTEST of all characters with her facials and comments...  Her when saying yes to marrying Kyousuke, and her telling to put the ring of her finger is the absolute cutest moments of Kirino, for me!  I love Kirino, no matter the hate, she's just special, more than Ruri or the other girls"
Oreimo,30sjtk,-Unorthodox-,1 point,Wed Apr 1 06:25:42 2015 UTC,When was this wtf
Oreimo,30sjtk,InkFoxclaw,1 point,Mon Apr 20 08:04:46 2015 UTC,People hate Kirino because she comes off as a bitch and her cute moments aren't enough to justify her attitude for some. She can also be pretty abusive towards Kyousuke which can get really annoying.  I hated her too at first but I ended up liking her by the end of the series.
Oreimo,30sjtk,KisukeUraharaHat,1 point,Wed Apr 1 06:03:50 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are mad that their ship got #rekt in the end when she won. People confuse ""good character"" with ""likable character"" often. While I do happen to love Kirino and think she's very likable, I think her character itself is great as well. No other anime character is quite like her. Plus, it makes her dere moments that much more enjoyable."
Oreimo,30sjtk,thefran,-1,Sun Apr 5 07:53:40 2015 UTC,"::Completely my opinion:: I don't really care how everything ended. Kirino was a total bitch the entire show. She had her moments, but there are many other characters that I like more than her. Manami being one of them.  She takes tsundere to a new low and is actually just a bitch to Kyousuke. While it is funny to hate her, she actually just sucks as a character. I hate tsunderes as well, so there's that too."

Oreimo,2zmbt0,SamMee514,1 point,Fri Mar 20 12:43:24 2015 UTC,Here is the mobile version of your link
Oreimo,2zm6ia,CokeFryChezbrgr,9,Thu Mar 19 19:11:14 2015 UTC,"People were asking for a tutorial, so here we go. I'm going to assume everyone here has little to no knowledge about this kind of stuff, so I'm going to slowly go step by step. Rather help everyone than leave one person behind.  First off, this is an ANDROID ONLY TUTORIAL USING WINDOWS! I do not have a iPhone or a Mac, so I don't know how to do it on there (if you even can).    Go to the Play Store and search for PPSSPP. It's a PSP emulator that you put on your phone. If you're reading this on mobile, here's a direct link. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ppsspp.ppssppgold Download PPSSPP onto your phone. Once it's installed, go on your computer and download the OreImo VN English Patch. You can do this one of two ways. Either go here and scroll down to the download links and click each link that contains 1 of 3 parts to the game (I would recommend clicking the mirrors). Downloading from the links on the website will help support the creators, but you will have to go through different websites that can be shady. The only one I trust is 4shared. And it's a shaky trust. In order to download, you have to sign in with an account like Facebook, Google+, Twitter, or something else. Can't remember. You should now have 3 files that each contain a part of the game. Now you need to extract them. To do so, you need a .rar browser. There are two that you can use, 7zip or Winrar. I use Winrar. Download whichever one you want. They are both relatively the same.  Install whichever file browser you downloaded. Should only take a few seconds. Open Part 1 of the game with the file browser you just installed. You should just have to double-click it, but if it doesn't work, right click the file and there should be an option in the context menu that says ""Open with Winrar"" (If you installed it) or ""Open with 7zip"" (If you installed it). Click that. A window should open up that contains two files. One will say ""OreImo_Tsuzuku_Disk_1_English_v1.0.iso"". That's the one you need to extract. To do so, right click the file and click ""Extract to specified folder"" (it might say something different for 7zip, but it should have the word ""Extract"" and that's what you need). A menu will pop up that has all these options and words and stuff. Don't mind any of it. All you need is the bar at the top that should specify where the file will be extracted to. Usually, it will go to a folder in your Downloads that is called ""OreImo_Disk1_v1."" Just click OK or Accept. The file will extract on its own. You do not need to extract the other two parts. You only need to extract one part. You will now have a file that ends in "".iso"". This is the game. KEEP THIS WINDOW OPEN Connect your phone to your computer via the USB cable (or if you use a wireless Phone-PC app, use that). If you used USB, a screen on your phone will pop up asking what state to put your phone in. Tap ""Mount as disk drive."" If a menu pops up on your computer asking what to do with your phone, click the button that says something like ""Explore files on computer"" or ""Browse phone files."" If the menu does not pop up, go to My Computer and under ""Connected Devices"" your phone should be there. Double-click it. Go to your storage of choice. If you have an SD card for your phone, go there. If not, go to ""Internal Storage."" A bunch of folders will pop up. Click the button at the top of the window that says ""New folder"" or right click and select ""Create new folder."" Name it whatever you want. I called mine ""OreImo VN."" Open the folder. It will be empty. Go to the window you kept open that has the game in it. Click and drag the file over to the folder you just created. The game will copy over into your phone. This may take a few minutes, as the game is 1.3gb.   And now you're all set! Close everything and eject your phone. Open PPSSPP. Under the ""Games"" tab, there should be a bunch of buttons that are names of your folders. Find the one that you made for the game. Tap it and it will open up the folder. The game will be inside. Tap that and OreImo will start up. Good luck with your imouto!  Edit: Google Drive wasn't wanting to cooperate, so that option is out."

I whent on facebook and there is not alot of Oreimo followers. Where should i share this reddit to make sure theres more replies, more topics and fun???"
Oreimo,2zfqei,Purple_Skyy,3,Wed Mar 18 05:23:30 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt mind the subreddit growing, but if you look at it from a different angle, the less veiwers, the more personal and exclusive this subreddit is, which imo makes is pretty nice.  On bigger places on the internet (youtube facebook twitter whatever) or even big subreddits (league of legends comes to mind, I browse that) people are generally very hostile towards eachother. Here however, people are all very nice and kind towards eachother. So actually I take it back, I would mind this subreddit growing :P  Kirino forever btw!"
Oreimo,2zfqei,Henry132,2,Wed Mar 18 16:23:05 2015 UTC,"Err, first time playing a visual novel? That's what it's like most of the time.  In this game, the only time you can interact and change the direction of the story is during the Two Shot Dialogue sequences and using the ORE elements. Just keep playing, you'll see the Two Shot Dialogue soon enough."
Oreimo,2zfqei,InkFoxclaw,-5,Wed Mar 18 05:40:47 2015 UTC,"So its basicly just a novel, with animations and few interaction moments...  I tauth it was a universe where you choosed anything to say to Kirino.  I was hoping chatting with her!"

It's a visual novel, bro.  It's essentially just more show. The choices you make (for example, choosing Kuroneko's skill vs. The prizes for Kirino) and the chat bubbles you... reply to? Greatly impact how the story ends. You can't call yourself an OreImo fan until you've 100% that game. It's still way waaaay worth playing even though it's not an open world."

But theres a nice continuation of the Oreimo original story called Hoshikuzu Namida, its a doujin, but very well done with the same exact character designs and way of talking. Theres 4 novel out, 5th one coming out soon...  Some say its Canon, in partnership with the original author. Thats the part that needs to be proven. But overall, I am happy with this follow up that fixes the ""break up"" after graduation. KIRINO FOR THE WIN!

I recommend reading these doujins: https://www.fakku.net/doujinshi/hoshikuzu-namida-english There's a total of four parts, just search for the other three.

Oreimo,2yeer5,marche250,2,Mon Mar 9 04:12:22 2015 UTC,"Also, the author did state that although he couldn't actually make a total incest ending because of the publishers, his version of the story (which is the actual version) ends with them being together. So, yay!"
Oreimo,2yeer5,CokeFryChezbrgr,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:48:09 2015 UTC,"Thats what rumours said, but is there any blog from him mentioning it... I feel like being told a happy lie not to depress.   Why did the publisher didn't allow a full incest story if there aint laws against it. Oreimo could have continue 2-3 seasons more. That equals more fans, more products, more $$$  I guess finding a other publishers for a redo of the ending is out of his mind?"

Oreimo,2yeer5,MrJoeyJunior,2,Mon Mar 9 19:17:29 2015 UTC,Yeah the true ending goes the route of them not actually being related by blood so its not a complete taboo. I think the the author should have went this route with the anime to make their love acceptable...
Oreimo,2yeer5,MrJoeyJunior,2,Mon Mar 9 15:16:48 2015 UTC,"I would make sense looking at Kyosuke, he doesnt have any resemblance to his dad... His dad is massive, hes tiny. I guess it would make sense that Kyosuke is adopted."

Not the quality of work/background into the character.    Because I find that most intriguing. The character that does everything right, by the book, and even simultaneously appends herself to societal standards while shielding her desired beau from the negative effects of it... and still doesn't come out on top.    Tragic, tragic character."
Oreimo,2y3by4,ApplicableSongLyric,11,Fri Mar 6 08:47:40 2015 UTC,"She doesn't do it correctly though does she? I mean would you tell a little girl that she can't love her Brother. She was spiteful towards Kirino and didn't ever try to fix it. She saw the problems she created and instead of being mature about it and perhaps owning up to her mistakes she let them drive a wedge between a Brother and Sister.  She was a sham and basically stopped Kyousuke from being a good hard working person, to being a lazy idiot for her to look after. It's kinda like the woman in Misery.   And besides all of that she was also just awful. She was firstly generic as all hell looking, and genuinely boring. I think the Author did want us to hate her."
Oreimo,2y3by4,Vikingstein,3,Fri Mar 6 09:34:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, as in level of evil. She's very well written to make so many people despise her so much. Probably one of the most well written characters in the story, to be honest."
Oreimo,2y3by4,AvalonBright,2,Fri Mar 6 17:38:58 2015 UTC,"If it was indicated that she wouldn't be a good person, even a player in the harem, then it would be fine. But no."

The anime is over and most discussions have been reposted about ten times over; bickering about the characters is really all the sub has left.    TLDR: Downvote filthy console peasants and Manami"

Oreimo,2y3hg9,Pl1xpl0x,1 point,Fri Mar 6 03:18:26 2015 UTC,"That's a bit of an overreaction. Yes, nice things said about Manami get down voted, but that's what the whole up/down votes are for. To up vote what you like/agree with and down vote what you dislike/disagree with. No one said anything about being a horrible person for liking Manami. But the general consensus is that Manami sucks and the subreddit likes to exaggerate its response to that. Also, as PikKirby said, the anime and Light Novels are over, so unless you have new material to post there isn't much left to talk about."
Oreimo,2y3hg9,Fissie,1 point,Fri Mar 6 03:36:43 2015 UTC,"You just gotta think about what you want here. I mean, I personally mostly only upvote to show that I agree with someone, only downvoting something like ""fuck you, you are dumb"" or anything like that.  And also, this is even more important in my opinion: What does karma matter??? I mean, honestly I don't know what it's for and honestly, I couldn't care less. I rarely ever check my karma and reddit for me is to talk and say what I want. I dont give a single fuck about downvotes and I don''t get why people do. Internet e-penis? Lol. I thought noone talked about Reddit IRL, so .. I just don't know.   Just take downvotes as ""I disagree"", even though I would like to see a few less downvotes based on ""Oh you like Kirino and I like Kuroneko? DOWNVOTE"" :D"

Oreimo,2x82t8,jcmyrand,25,Tue Mar 10 09:32:15 2015 UTC,"Well Ayase is a straight up psychopath, and as the old saying goes never put your dick in crazy.  Ruri is a midget chunni that personally I think I would get annoyed by in not too a period of time. I also don't find the whole gothic lolita thing that attractive. Kirino however is a girl that works for what she's got, she's got a few problems yes, but there far more manageable than crazy or chunni. She's got a good body that she's worked hard for and does well in school. She's also to me at least, more human, to an extent. Most people do bottle up their feelings and she's someone I can connect to in that regard."
Oreimo,2x82t8,Vikingstein,32,Thu Feb 26 13:05:43 2015 UTC,And she's hella hot.
Oreimo,2x82t8,Basher400,8,Thu Feb 26 13:16:34 2015 UTC,That too.

Oreimo,2x82t8,Vikingstein,4,Thu Feb 26 15:13:53 2015 UTC,"She looked so much smaller to me, must be a lack of presence."

Oreimo,2x82t8,sagrado_corazon,10,Sun Mar 1 22:34:14 2015 UTC,"How is this a mystery? Different people have different tastes. Kirino has a really strong personality, and she's not an introvert...so she's my favorite."
Oreimo,2x82t8,AvalonBright,1 point,Thu Feb 26 19:37:42 2015 UTC,Yeah you are right that  people have different tastes. Because of that i wanted to know why so many like her. :)
Oreimo,2x82t8,Wingzeroalchemist,4,Thu Feb 26 21:51:55 2015 UTC,"I'd get along better with Kirino. Besides the fact that she's super cute, I can relate to her interest in keeping up her fashionable side and being super girly and track, but of course the fact she's also a hardcore otaku is just another plus. And, also--she is incredibly hot. I mean there is that. >_>  Ruri is second best girl, but I don't know how much I could handle her chuuni IRL."
Oreimo,2x82t8,CokeFryChezbrgr,6,Fri Feb 27 03:35:28 2015 UTC,I like her cause I find her adorable. I'd love to date her or have her as a younger sister. Just something about her makes me want to take care of her.
Oreimo,2x82t8,Fissie,2,Thu Feb 26 22:15:29 2015 UTC,"Basically what /u/Vikingstein said. I think Ayase would be pretty hot (I mean, she IS a model) but she can be crazy and VERY violent. Yeah, no thanks.  As for Ruri, well, I hated the whole chuuni thing in the show, so I would hate to have to deal with that every day. I look at a chuuni and think ""Get away and don't talk to me."" However, I do like her straightforward thinking and how she isn't afraid of saying what's on her mind.  Kirino is my kind of girl. One that is very active, isn't afraid of asking for help, knows what she wants, and let's ALL be honest. She's a looker. You know it. And, like every other person on this planet, she does have her flaws. She bottles up her feelings, she can be bitchy at some times, and she is a complete otaku (I wouldn't call that a flaw, but others might, so I'm adding it in.) But come on, we all bottle our feelings in at some point and we can all be assholes when provoked.  TL;DR: Ayase is crazy, Ruri is a cringey chuuni, and Kirino is a regular person."
Oreimo,2x82t8,TeaKey7,4,Thu Feb 26 17:45:11 2015 UTC,"Ruri is a cringey chuuni   I feel like mentionning that in her Oreimo PSP route, she gets over her chuunibyou over time."
Oreimo,2x82t8,Potatomesh,1 point,Fri Feb 27 02:34:47 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you about Ayase.   As for Ruri, well, I hated the whole chuuni thing in the show, so I would hate to have to deal with that every day.   Hmm... I think you are right. It would be sometimes hard to deal with a girl who would dress like an figure from an  anime on a date.  But at the end I kinda like this ""chuuni"" thing. I don't really know why I just like to see how she thinks it is something normal.  Also thank you for this nice description why you like Kirino I understand why people like her more than the other characters."
Oreimo,2x82t8,White_sama,2,Fri Feb 27 14:24:45 2015 UTC,"well, I (and I assume that you too) like ruri. In my opinion she is much more cute then kirino. moreover she has her spirit that makes her funnier and cooler! but I like kirino too xP"
Oreimo,2x82t8,Beasts_at_the_Throne,2,Fri Feb 27 14:48:56 2015 UTC,"First off, Kirino is the ""main"" focus of the anime.  So sub-consciously, people will relate themselves into the shoes of ""Kyousuke"" since he is the actual main protagonist and since his interactions are usually pointed at Kirino, undoubtedly there will be people who just back up the main ""herione"" as they do other animes ex: Asuna, Mikasa, Sakura and all dem other hyped animes.  I support her so much because I would like to see her and Kyousuke together, but then again, I think every character in this anime is AMAZING, I go as far as to say Manami is because she was super well built, and heck, without her my dear Kyousuke and Kirino would never have realized their feelings.  Of course they have their faults, but regardless, I love all of them.  Not to leave the rest of you out of this, BUT I LOVE YOU SAORI!"

And slipping down the slope seems more like a blessing than a curse, but we'll see :)  EDIT: SHIT, apperently pre owned means preovoiusly owned, im an idiot, thats not what I meant.

I was in the same boat, though it was toward a cousin of mine. Also, I think he's better off with her than any other character.  Or Ruri.   They're the only ones I can see being together with him.

Oreimo,2uombf,CasualRedditer13,5,Tue Feb 3 21:52:31 2015 UTC,"What drew me into it was the humor. The show kept me laughing throughout the majority of the series. Some people claim Kyousuke is a ""self-insert"" character, but I disagree. Kyousuke's reactions to the situations he gets thrust into are one of my favorite things about the show. I'm also a fan of Kyousuke's voice actor, Yuuichi Nakamura, since he's done some roles in a few other series which I particularly enjoyed.  I loved the way it inserted anime references all over the place and celebrated otaku culture while also acknowledging that there is a negative stigma associated with it. As someone who was living in Japan when I first watched the show, I especially loved how they showed various locations around Akihabara that I'd actually been to. Just watching the show made me want to hop on the next train to Akihabara and get some figures of my own.  Even if I was a bit less than satisfied with the ending, the suspense of not knowing who Kyousuke was actually going to choose until the end kept me guessing until the duration of the show. The sad moments were sad for me, as I had actually gotten to like a few of the girls quite a bit, namely Kirino, Kuroneko, and Ayase. I thought some of the developmental scenes between characters were rather sweet. Sure, the harem aspect started to rear its head a bit more prominently during the second season, but I still thought it was fun.  I loved how Oreimo was both hilarious and touching at times. I flat out just had a lot of fun watching it."
Oreimo,2uombf,Neo_Paradigm,2,Wed Feb 4 07:29:41 2015 UTC,"I basically went over everything I love about this series in my review that I posted immediately after I finished.   To sum it up: I love the characters, the way everything looks, the story, the relationships, and the music. I have the first OP (Irony) as a playlist by itself so it repeats. Probably has upwards of 2000 plays by now."

Oreimo,2uombf,mchx,2,Wed Feb 4 03:26:04 2015 UTC,"Haha sorry for that, I'll try to the next time I get on a PC"
Oreimo,2uombf,KusonagiKuroi,2,Wed Feb 4 07:21:13 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be honest, I enjoyed part 1 far more than part 2. And no, I didn't dislike part 2 because of incest.  The characters are definitely the most popular reason and I agree. The majority of the cast are highly enjoyable (even Manami). I'm not a big fan of Kyosuke as a character, but I won't say he was a bad protagonist, just not one that I like. Manami is one that many may dislike, but her cold splash of reality is a good one. Although Kirino is my favorite character in that series, I actually ship KyousukeRuri. Kuroneko is tons of fun in both her inner self and her more dramatic self. None one dislikes Ayase from what I know. Her Yandere is humorous, but she's surprisingly reliable and a great friend. Saori was a fan favorite for a long time, and then she took off the glasses and it just got better. True to herself,  friendly, and active otaku. And Kirino, although at times I'll agree is the cause of the occasional migraine, has a bunch of cute imouto properties that'll just melt ya.  The story for part 1 is definitely the one I enjoyed most. Often in anime, the brother sister role is simplified or over erotic. I'm not against these presentations and I'm not saying they all do it, but it was definitely a great feeling to watch a show about 2 siblings reconcile with one another and become really close. It was heart warming and fun to watch!"

Oreimo,2ufnf2,IAmAPeachAMA,3,Mon Feb 2 03:54:11 2015 UTC,I think the next big question here is where are you gonna put the 1/2.5 scale?

Oreimo,2ufnf2,Neo_Paradigm,2,Mon Feb 2 14:05:40 2015 UTC,Love it! Also super jealous of the casual clothes one!
Oreimo,2ufaz2,CokeFryChezbrgr,8,Sun Feb 1 17:48:35 2015 UTC,"To be blunt, Kyousuke can't win because he upset the morons who self-inserted as him. The only thing people hate more than an indecisive MC is one who makes a choice they don't agree with, which is humorously hypocritical but something Oreimo made clear.  Kyousuke is his own character with his own development, yet people get upset because they neglect that and think he should behave how they want instead of how his established character should."
Oreimo,2ufaz2,DinTwo,4,Sun Feb 1 23:49:35 2015 UTC,"That's what I hate about these things. People LOVE to self-insert, and when the character make one ""wrong"" choice, they're forever hated and people think the character sucks and is poorly written. Really, the viewer is just a dumbass"

Oreimo,2ufaz2,luacs1998,8,Sun Feb 1 18:11:08 2015 UTC,"I am downvoting you because the only reason you've presented for disliking the character is that the story wasn't written to pander to your tastes, and you taunting people to downvote you is a childish way to protect your opinion from criticism."

Oreimo,2tp0dc,Woowoo_Water,6,Mon Jan 26 05:46:05 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: read the light novels if you really can't get over the series. then watch DizzyZiddy's youtube videos on translated VN runs. (Ayase hnnnng...)  Oreimo kicked me into watching anime as my preferred medium of entertainment. Before that, maybe I'd watch one series, say Gundam, and not watch an anime series for months.  I'm into the whole incest thing Oreimo offered so I was still desperate for my next wincest fix. Slowly, my urges died down but I'm still enjoyed rom-com shenanigans, maybe some harems and Sword Art Online and Mahouka. This list will flow just as similarly. The first two are a must watch.   Yosuga no Sora   If you want to inject yourself with some H-level wincest straightaway, watch this. Fantasizing Kyousuke and Kirino crossing the line? Reading Doujins not enough? Want to see siblings fuck? Watch this. The wincest arc is the last few episodes, but it won't make sense at all if you don't watch from the start.   Kiss x Sis (especially the OVAs)   Watching this series, to be more preciese, 3 episodes out of the OVA season (not necessarily consective nor the first 3), got me out of my incest phase of Anime. Because damn, incestual fantasy scenarios ran full fucking throttle for this anime. After Kiss x Sis, you might question whether you're really into this incest trope. Time for regular rom coms.    Onee-chan ga Kita   Optional but is an adorable few minutes per episode series.   Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne! (OniAi)   Sister blatantly likes her brother in this series. Not really to my liking though. It's on my On Hold list for some reason I don't remember. I think I never gotten into it. The LNs are... almost fully translated? Hm, I might give this a rewatch.   Saikin Imouto no Yousu ga Chotto Okashiinda ga.   Non-blood related. Sibling possessed by spirit, requiring her to fall in love with aniki. An annoying recurring joke and weak plot (purely my opinion), might bore you in this series. I never gotten to finish it anyways. I'm not so sure about the Source Material.    (From this point, you can watch in any order. Depending on what you desire; what you want the anime to focus on. I'll give a heads up if the anime ends of inconclusively (i.e. read the raw LN/manga to continue. That sucks.))   Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (Romance, Drama, Comedy) (Open ending, Source LN untranslated, sequel highly unlikely) Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru (aka NouCome) (Romance, Comedy) (Open ending, Source LN untranslated, no sequel in sight) Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. (Romance, Drama, Comedy) (Open ending, Source LN untranslated, no sequel in sight) Hataraku Maou-sama! (Comedy, Romance) (Open ending, Source Manga/LN followup untranslated) Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de (Slice of Life, Comedy, Romance, Drama) (Open ending, Source LN untranslated) Tora Dora! (Romance, Drama) White Album 2 (Romance, Drama) Sankarea (Romance, Drama) (Source manga completed and translated) Nisekoi (Romance, Drama, Harem) (Source manga popular, translated, and ongoing) (WARNING. Plot development especially in Source is currently snails pace)   The following 3 are rom-com or romance deconstructions. If you are tired of this genre that you are beginning to be well versed in, these are enjoyable to watch as they subvert tropes.   Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. (aka Oregairu) (Drama, Romance, Comedy) (Source LN is fully up to date and translated. Season 2 in April 2015) Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (Comedy, Romance) (Source Manga is up to date and translated) Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata: Ai to Seishun no Service Kai (Romance, Drama)"
Oreimo,2tp0dc,Pl1xpl0x,2,Mon Jan 26 13:53:05 2015 UTC,"That list is pretty good, I like most of the animes you listed here, but I saw that you forgot one in my opinion pretty major incest anime.   Boku wa Imouto ni Koi wo suru.   There is an anime movie (45 mins iirc) to that and even a movie with humans (about 2 hrs, the link is to youtube with english subs)  BokuImoKoi Movie with humans  BokuImoKoi Anime movie  They are actually not too bad. I'm not 100% sure how I feel about all of that incest stuff, but just had to mention it :D  Edit: Onii-chan no Koto Nanka Zenzen Suki Janain Dakara ne!! is also an anime of the incest category, this time focusing on the younger sister ...chasing after her onii-chan :D"

Oreimo,2tp0dc,CokeFryChezbrgr,1 point,Thu Jan 29 01:24:45 2015 UTC,Nice list but I would throw in Koi Kaze and  for reading purposes Kana Imouto since I would say they come closer to OreImo and mainly Yosuga no Sora because the approach is more serious and not over the top like in Kiss x Sis

Oreimo,2sl123,KingLeonid45,21,Fri Jan 16 02:00:53 2015 UTC,Manami a shit.  Seriously.  HUGE SPOILERS IN THE IMAGE  Do not look at the image until you have finished the series. But this shows exactly what a huge bitch Manami is.  http://i.imgur.com/piHZ553.jpg
Oreimo,2sl123,CokeFryChezbrgr,2,Fri Jan 16 03:10:17 2015 UTC,That was such a wall of text I don't even know where to begin...
Oreimo,2sl123,luacs1998,13,Fri Jan 16 03:16:17 2015 UTC,Start with the top left
Oreimo,2sl123,CokeFryChezbrgr,5,Fri Jan 16 03:18:09 2015 UTC,"You think I didn't read it.  Heck, the author could go deconstruct Manami's personality for a psychology thesis..."
Oreimo,2sl123,luacs1998,2,Fri Jan 16 03:26:55 2015 UTC,"This image is exactly what I've been looking for. It a) proves me right with all my dislike for Manami and b) summarizes everything nicely. What's written there is just so true. When discussing with a friend why I like OreImo, I always tell him about how deep it is and give him the example of the Manami background being a reason for all of it to happen. I think I'll just link him this picture and he'll finally understand."
Oreimo,2sl123,Pl1xpl0x,1 point,Fri Jan 16 12:09:46 2015 UTC,"welp. After watching the rest of the series and reading this wall of text I don't know how to feel about Manami. Between the time I finished the series and the time I started reading the wall I was good with Manami. After reading the wall I don't particularly have a thought about her.   I loved how Manami's family treated Kyo and how head-over-heels she was for him. Even after their fight scene I thought she was in the good.   But that wall seems a bit like a conspiricy that someone does like how all the children in the Rugrats are dead and that Angelica made them up. I don't know. I really enjoyed the series but I don't hate Manami as much as everyone else.  To each their own, right?"
Oreimo,2sl123,CokeFryChezbrgr,1 point,Sat Jan 17 00:31:57 2015 UTC,I guess I will have a look at this in about 8 episodes. Do I have to watch the OVA's (if there are any for season 2)?

I only wish that it could have ended with Kyo with one of the many other women that threw themselves at him throughout the show.   Also, in the end I still liked Manami. Even after and during their brawl. I just loved the whole 'childhood friends thing' that they had especially when they were at Manami's house with the grandparents."
Oreimo,2sl123,White_sama,3,Sat Jan 17 00:22:20 2015 UTC,"Most of us here on the sub dislike her because she was selfish.  She was the one who told Kyosuke to mellow out, and she scolded Kirino for having feelings for him."

Oreimo,2sl123,DinTwo,1 point,Fri Jan 16 12:10:39 2015 UTC,I got to the end. As I watched I began to dislike her. At the end I enjoyed her. After reading the wall of text about her evil plan (it is in the other comments) I lost any real opinion about her.   I still think her and Kyo were really cute though.
Oreimo,2sl123,Pl1xpl0x,8,Sat Jan 17 00:36:00 2015 UTC,She hit Kirino. She deserves a slow and painful death in a cave with kyousuke spitting on her.
Oreimo,2sl123,TrustMeIGotHaki,4,Fri Jan 16 12:30:09 2015 UTC,"She did. But, she put Kirino in her place. Even Kyo was getting agitated at her. I don't like Manami anymore but I haven't found the grounds to full hate her with the fury that it appears most do."
Oreimo,2sl123,TrustMeIGotHaki,2,Sat Jan 17 00:34:06 2015 UTC,with kyousuke spitting on her.   She'd probably like that.

Oreimo,2sl123,Frondo,2,Fri Jan 16 18:47:57 2015 UTC,But why is that the problem? She is a nice character and presently her and Kyo are dating so I jumped on the bandwagon. I still don't see the problem or the need for such hostility.
Oreimo,2sl123,Frondo,0,Fri Jan 16 18:50:24 2015 UTC,"Oh.  Well. You'll see. And it's mostly just friendly jabs at the ""other team"". Though you did say Kirino is a bitch and I can't fucking go past that m8"
Oreimo,2sl123,Frondo,2,Fri Jan 16 18:53:49 2015 UTC,"I will recant my previous statement to, ""She was acting biotchy."" There, now I haven't called her a bitch.   I couldn't tell if that was a friendly jab or not so sorry bout dat. I got a LOT of hositile stuff so I just kinda put on the anti-hate-hat and moved in.   My flair is me constantly changing who I want Kyo to end up with. I don't know if you noticed or if it changes but since I posted this I changed my flair like 3 or 4 times. So I have yet to make a firm position.  And although Kirino is cute and stuff, she is also really angry like all the time (at least where I am in the series)."
Oreimo,2sl123,Frondo,1 point,Fri Jan 16 18:59:33 2015 UTC,That's called being a tsundere.
Oreimo,2sl123,itaShadd,2,Fri Jan 16 19:10:09 2015 UTC,yeah. I original had the same problem in Toradora. But I eventually came around to that. So I hope this series has a better sending off.
Oreimo,2sl123,Onny1337,3,Fri Jan 16 20:47:38 2015 UTC,"I like her. Really. And since she is the most tragic Character of the series... I also pity her.  She isn't a very exciting Character, especially for pairing her up, yes.  The irrational hate she gets?   Kirino-Shipper which only concentrate on the Kirino-side of the argument. The actual main-character of the series is Kyousuke, and she is his best friend, trying since like...5 or 6 years to get him to see her as anything more than a granny. Since she has to witness him practically dating several other girls, even being ok with everyone but his SISTER, I don't think their isn't much space to say she is that terrible.  -Vague LN 11 Spoilers ahead-  Now I hear already the screaming voices of the lynch-mob:  ""But she destroyed his connection to his family !!!!1!einself"".  At the end of LN 11 he had most likely destroyed himself if she hasn't been there. Also his connection to his family most likely had been shaky enough, since the novel begins with getting beaten up because of his stupidity, and with the following accident being a bit more extrem than that, I guess their hadn't been anyone who was saying ""good boy"" in the aftermath.  ""But Kirino could comfort him!!!1""  Yeah, right. While crying her own eyes out, little-11-year-old Kirino also should have been able to look at her super-Aniki, being the fragile and broken mess he was at the end of LN 11. Let's bring in the Trauma, gentleman! Even Manami's hard reality speech should have been considerable softer than such an event.  The fact is: She had been the only one standing by his side at the end of LN 11, had even been protecting him, so his class hasn't been able to bring the pain to a new level.   ""She turned him into a useless bum/ stole away his awesomeness/ turned him into her perfect husband/ took him away from Kirino etc.!""   Let's pretend Kyousuke stayed the dick he has been in LN 11. Not only he would have been hated by the whole school, also he most likely wouldn't have been able to help the other girls. Why?  He himself admits that he had looked down on people like Rock and Kami/Kuroneko when he was younger. He acted before thinking back then- the kill-flags everyone raised would have murdered him until his death. He wouldn't have had the patience he had in the actual storyline.  And for the perfect husband-argument/the take away?  Isn't Kirino doing the exact same thing to him? Doesn't she rip apart a friendship which has been incredible valuable to Manami and Kyousuke?   Even if one says Manami deserved that, (and here a little hint: no one deserves that) everyone had to admit that Kirino had done almost the same thing.   Also here my little speculation: Manami didn't wanted him into Mr. perfect-Husband. She simply wanted him to stay away from harm, something every friend would want."
Oreimo,2sl123,VahShir409,3,Fri Jan 16 13:35:24 2015 UTC,"Funny you should show up in another Manami thread and claim no one focuses on both sides when you stopped discussing it with me the last time you pulled this bullshit. You're oversimplifying the issue and basing your entire argument on imaginary worst-case scenarios. Sorry Loenid, but his 'rebuttals' are a joke, and him attempting to make the opposing points sound retarded through exclamation points, ones, and misrepresenting the issue should be a red flag.  The stupid image about Manami being some malevolent puppet master is definitely exaggerated, and that's bold because you ignored it every time I said it in the last thread. You're merely acting as the opposite extreme to those blindly calling Manami a bitch. You claim she's done nothing wrong and cite nothing but a theoretical worst case scenario (people murdering him because he was an obnoxious child, really?) as your proof.   All we have is her actions and the result, and her actions hurt people and needed to be undone. We know that Kyousuke stopped trying to improve himself, that the sibling's relationship was damaged, that Kyousuke's parents were disappointed, and that Manami made absolutely no attempt to rectify any of these side effects. We know that Manami stayed idle as Kyousuke cut himself off from most of the things that were previously important to him, and became dependent on Manami. We know that it took three years for any progress to be made on Kyousuke's recovery, and only by accident. We know that Manami was happy with Kyousuke being this way, and that Kyousuke admits he was not whole. Manami even said things were perfect that way, when anyone but her could see they clearly were not. These are things that actually happened. Wild speculation of what could have happened if Manami had not intervened does not excuse her from these things, and if we wanted to address that line of thought we should probably start with the alternate timeline story that seems to explore exactly that.  If you're so concerned about how things could've been if things had gone differently, what about the scenario where Kyousuke's relationship with his sister, his confidence and his aspirations never returned? What if he remained completely dependent on Manami just as he was? Wouldn't that broken sibling relationship be unquestionably Manami's doing, all in the name of ""staying away from harm""? This is what it seems like Manami and you would've preferred happen, but if you write that story doesn't it make Manami seem even more selfish and awful?   The girl who's jealous of her childhood friend showing off to his sister and spending too much time with a cute neet tells him to be normal in his time of emotional turmoil, so he stops talking to his sister, never attempts to reconcile with the neet girl or anyone for that matter, and spends the rest of his life at the heels of the childhood friend who asked him to be someone else. Does this picture really make Manami look more the hero? Would this be a better story than Kyousuke regaining control of his life and making his own decisions?  My opinion of Manami is the same as it was last time:   It's not entirely her fault that she has a draining effect on Kyousuke, and some fault lies with Kyousuke for growing dependent on her in the first place. I think her comforting and wanting to be with Kyousuke all those years was fair, but having her hands in the sibling's relationship in their youth was completely out of order. Whether she intended to push Kirino away or not, it was very apparent that she did have an effect her, and as Kyousuke's friend it was her responsibility to try to right her wrongs because family is more important. If she had, she likely would've prevented the whole cold war, the sibling's dramatic recovery, and their love for each other. Instead, she didn't actually try to patch things up until volume 11, seemingly because the siblings had gotten too close.  In the end I suppose my feelings towards the matter are similar to what Kirino thinks by the end. I can appreciate that she helped Kyousuke in a tough time, but I won't ignore how comfortable she was with his drastic change in character. With the sibling's relationship, her actions were ironically her own undoing, and by the end she leaves a sour taste accompanied by a respect that she'll move on with her life and let Kyousuke live his, finally.    Manami's not just a villain, but she's not the saint you want her to be. Everyone seems to be either looking to unconditionally despise her or unconditionally defend her. We just circlejerk amongst the people who agree with us, skimming the thread for someone who also thinks so and so is best girl, throwing around our ""that's also my opinion!"" upvotes and it's pathetic. No one in Oreimo fits into either absolute because they all make mistakes and act like teenagers. That's why every major character in the series is polarizing. No one seems to care enough to look closely at both sides of the character.   They're all mostly good people who fuck up sometimes. Even Manami, by the end. There's no reason to solely hate any of them, and all I've ever seen you do in these threads is try to clean up the character you like by trying to dirty up another. Just consider all of them as teenagers in love who sometimes make poor decisions, and stop trying to paint one of them as flawless. In the same vein, people should stop trying to paint Manami as the devil. You don't have to search for an excuse or complaint for their every action just because you like or dislike them."
Oreimo,2sl123,VahShir409,2,Sat Jan 17 09:22:28 2015 UTC,"I really like your approach to this whole matter. What you've said about the polarizing opinions is pretty true IMO, not only with Manami. It is kind of sad that, while there is some discussion going on, its mostly 2 opposite opinons clashing and noone trying to see both points.   What I actually find is really interesting is that Manami is the character where the most people seem to have a big opinion and want to discuss it."
Oreimo,2sl123,VahShir409,-1,Sun Jan 18 16:03:01 2015 UTC,Thank you for the huge wall of thoughts. I haven't finished the series yet so I saw -LN- so I will return when I have finished the series!

Physical appearance; Ayase or Saori. To be honest though I really loved all the characters at separate times for changing reasons.   Also as cute as Kirino is, she was soooooooooooooo mean throughout the series and it was really off putting. Mainly because I imagine my sis being that mean and I get irritated so I probably translated that to Kirino's character."

Oreimo,2sgx6a,pwner1519,1 point,Thu Jan 15 02:05:44 2015 UTC,"There was a short story called ""A Chance Encounter"" months ago. The possibility of another afterstory isn't known because the details of the artbook and first afterstory were mistranslated and then spread, but no one seemed to know what the actual deal was.   I don't know what this says, or if this refers to the afterstory in the art book or if it's related to the previous image. If I had to guess I'd say it's talking about a second Hiroyuki ODA artbook to be released in 2015, and seeing how much of the last art book wasn't even Oreimo, and that he's currently working on Ero-manga Sensei, I find it hard to believe it will have anything to do with Oreimo."
Oreimo,2sgx6a,DinTwo,2,Thu Jan 15 08:51:53 2015 UTC,Those pictures are indeed in his artbook and announce the follow up for 2015 which probably will contain another after Story  related
Oreimo,2sgx6a,DinTwo,1 point,Thu Jan 15 14:07:34 2015 UTC,"The image which says ""Afterstory"" in the Crunchyroll article is the title to the short story that has already been scanned and translated. I don't know what the blue backgrounded passage says exactly, but it's printed after the artist's interview, at least two pages after the Afterstory already included in the artbook.   I know I saw those clippings taken out of context before I saw Crunchyroll post them. I'm not sure if you can read the ""2015"" passage, but :  2015年発売予定の画集第2弾では  かんさきひるのもうーつの顔  Seems to imply a second art book. Unless there's some source (perhaps the artist's interview?) that extends beyond the rumors Crunchyroll helped spread, those images don't suggest another afterstory. I'd be happy to be proven wrong but as far as I can tell it's just misinformation."

Kirino's heartfelt ""yes"" brought massive feels, but Kyousuke sacrificing his standing with their samurai strict father, taking that punch to the face like a boss and then the ""I win"" before he conks out was a big damn hero moment.  As an older brother myself, that was the ideal all older brothers should strive for. The punch taking, not the incest. I'm 100% KyousukeXKirino, but you know, not exactly the ideal sibling relationship for the rest of the world."

The day those last 3 episodes aired I was at work and I just kept pestering the manager that was working that night to let me leave early. If only he knew why I wanted to go home so badly.

Oreimo,2r4zjs,TheGreatPinoy,9,Fri Jan 2 22:09:15 2015 UTC,"As I've said a million times on this subreddit. The publisher of the anime couldn't do a full incest ending. That ending scene where Kyouske kisses Kirino on the cheek was actually meant to be a kiss on the lips which was supposed to give you the assumption that they're still together. Just pretend that they did end up together because in the end, that's what the author truly wanted."

Oreimo,2r0twx,BladeRegalia,8,Thu Jan 1 18:27:46 2015 UTC,"If you like it in anime : No, you're not a bad person.   If you like it in real life too : No, you're still not a bad person but its no good."
Oreimo,2r0twx,Onny1337,4,Thu Jan 1 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"It is not necessarily a good or bad thing. It's just important to know most incest between family other than cousins or siblings taken away at a very young age is of abusive nature. This may be from a feeling of obligation, shame, or physical abuse. Ultimately it is realistic and respectful to abuse victims to see the concept of incest in immediate family as fictional."
Oreimo,2r0twx,massdestrucSEAN,3,Thu Jan 1 20:08:24 2015 UTC,"Are you a bad person? Hell no, why would you be? The more important question is: Do you now plan on acting on that... desire / lust / urge / however you wanna call it? Because that could be harmful. Not saying you are gonna storm into your sisters room while shes sleeping or anything, but if you get along well with your siblings (i dont even know if you have any), I guess it might hurt your relationship more than it will accomplish.   If you are interested in incest, there is a special subreddit for it (/r/incest). I don't really know what its like over there, just saw the link once here in this subreddit i think.  There are so many things in the world that people like (not only sexually, but also that I guess), so why would it be weird? I mean, the concept of sibling love IS a little strange IMO but its nothing that would make somebody a ""bad person""."

Oreimo,2qxzaz,ifuckinglovekatara,8,Wed Dec 31 19:17:52 2014 UTC,"Glad you agree that Season 2 was God's holy message to us all. Gotta make it short, New Year soon.  More canon story:  First After Story this pretty much continues the story some months after the main series ended   10 years reunion : This is a bonus novel from the Blu Rays. A story from Ruris youngest sister perspective pretty much 10 years later.  Original Work : Yeah if you like reading, read the Light Novel its worth it. More insight, more story etc.  Fanfictions:  Right now there is one of the best (if not the best) on the first page. You can find the first 3 chapter  right here.  Options: You can read the Manga adaption of the original Series aswell. It is ok but pretty bad compared to LN or Anime and it also stopped after 4 Volumes. Another good read is the Kuroneko spinoff Manga.   Recommendation:   Read LN Read official after storys Play VN Read Doujin I linked Take a look at the baka tsuki-site and check what you want to go for next. Post on subreddit if you have any question/ post content on subreddit   Btw nice joke with the last question dude since there is obviously no other choice because she is fucking perfect  Feel free to correct me /add more boys  was a bit in a hurry  oh and happy new year"
Oreimo,2qxzaz,TheGreatPinoy,3,Wed Dec 31 20:24:17 2014 UTC,"Nope that's about the it. You could play the VN and get the endings for all the other girls too but really there's nothing left. If you want a recommendation to watch after this, I can suggest Yosuga No Sora. It has similar character types and the MC ends up with a girl and then the show reverses time so that you can see what happens if he goes for the other girls. It also has a incest arc as well (which is arguably the best one) and as well as NSFW scenes so fair warning.  In conlusion, the show is basically done. You can play the VN but move on and find something else."
Oreimo,2qxzaz,nsfw-anon,3,Wed Dec 31 19:36:42 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I thought it was pretty good, couldn't wait to see who Kyousuke would end up with, Ruri and Kirino were the obvious choices. The decision? FUCKING NOBODY. Holy mother of god, I was so pissed.   On the other hand I feel like it may have helped me move a bit farther past my incest fetish, which I entirely believe to be a phase. It hasn't quite worked all the way, but long-term incest grosses me out now, so I guess it's baby steps."
Oreimo,2qwgcn,-Niernen,3,Wed Dec 31 07:26:08 2014 UTC,How much would you be willing to do for the three larger ones minus the minis or just Kirino and Kuroneko?
Oreimo,2qwgcn,-Niernen,2,Wed Dec 31 07:32:20 2014 UTC,$230 Shipped for all three 1/8 scales.  Then $180 shipped if you wanted just Kirino and Kuroneko.  But I'll prob wait to see if someone is interested in the whole set first.
Oreimo,2qwgcn,rockboy8,2,Wed Dec 31 07:41:24 2014 UTC,"No problem, I'm currently out on vacation anyways so I'm in no rush since shipping it may be a tad problematic till I get back. If no one want's the full set though I'm interesting in the other three."

Oreimo,2qwgcn,rockboy8,1 point,Thu Jan 1 03:58:10 2015 UTC,"dude, the over pricing is real.  first when posting figure lots can you at least link your mfc account CitricArt.  If I was going to buy this group of figures I'd take my business to mandarake first because they would have a higher guarantee of quality then some dude i saw on reddit.   I found the figures on mandarake:  Alpha-Omega Kuroneko by Sega 7000 yen , $58.4 usd  Meruru Kirino by Sega 10,000 yen, $83.5 Usd  Ayase by Kotobukiya 3000 yen, $25.0 usd  And the small figures go for 600 yen each ($5 usd) Kuroneko and kirino. Which means the set would be worth $20 usd  so I could obtain this set of figures from a more reputable source for $186.9 before shipping (lots around this size tend to have about $25 sal shipping)   Please, if your going to sell figures please price them cheaper then your better competitors, your mfc account shows you clearly have an understanding of what they are worth, yet you didn't price them accordingly."
Oreimo,2qwgcn,White_sama,1 point,Wed Dec 31 22:33:07 2014 UTC,"Do you know how much EMS shipping would be for the entire set? Well over $60... I'am not in Japan, you do not have to pay $60+ to get your package in 5-7 days. Or two payments of $35 or so to get your package delivered via SAL while also being insured, and wait anywhere from 2-4 weeks for both. Do you not know SAL has a size limit, this set would have to be shipped in two different packages just to be shipped to you bc it is so big. How can you not properly calculate shipping into your figure shopping from Japan anyways. It's such a huge part of it. I'm sorry if you think this 'wow overpriced' but no... This is free 2-3 day  insured shipping here from the USA. I base my prices of Madarake the and the fact I'am here in America selling to other Americans with out SAL rules etc. No one said you had to buy from me anyways lol..."
Oreimo,2quko1,-Niernen,5,Tue Dec 30 20:44:55 2014 UTC,"What the fuck.... Oreimo is based off a Light Novel,not a Visual Novel, which you could have easily found with a google search. Wikipedia and plenty of sites have synopsis that will explain the basic story without spoiling much."
Oreimo,2quko1,Floattube,3,Tue Dec 30 22:12:12 2014 UTC,It would be better if you just watch it instead of wondering if you have watched enough anime in the past. I don't see how that makes any difference. And the show is based of a light novel series by the same name. There is a visual novel on the PSP that is based off the light novel.

But in short, Oreimo is an anime and a light novel (a form of manga). The anime has some slight changes from the novel, as one would expect, but for the most part the anime is true to form. It's about a guy who has a little sister who he doesn't normally get along with. She shares a secret hobby with him, and from that, their relationship improves. They make friends. Stuff happens. Romantic tension.  I hope this explanation helps."

Oreimo,2qjmxz,Simplerdayz,2,Sat Dec 27 22:22:15 2014 UTC,Childhood friend who hung in there throughout and didn't judge him about his porn and eroge interests when confronted with them?    She's super patient. Kirino blew what she said a decade prior out of proportion and that made her the bad guy.    She got the shaft.
Oreimo,2qjmxz,ApplicableSongLyric,6,Sun Dec 28 00:27:48 2014 UTC,"really. Ok i gotta say im drunk so dont be mad, but ..really??? SHE was the reason he ..turned away from kirino. without Manami, they would prolly have never ended up in that relationship. Manami brought him away from Kirino and is THE REASON why all of the stuff happening in the animes happened. like, really. I kinda liked manami in the first season cuz she was nice, but once I found out what she had done, especially to Kyousuke and his relationship to kirino, she was done. I can see her point, but she is fucking selfish. she is the root of all evil. I dont mind Kyousuke X kirino, but that would not have happened if it were not for manami. ...really!  edit: GO ayase! Go kanako! Go kirino!"
Oreimo,2qjmxz,Pl1xpl0x,2,Sun Dec 28 02:50:20 2014 UTC,"I hear that in the novels, she's more of a main character. Is she less hate-able there? She didn't come off as a character I liked. Characters like Kanako and Kirino, while they acted bratty sometimes, I always enjoyed. But I guess anything good Manami did in the series was contradicted by what was revealed she did in the OVAs. I really tried to see the good in her, especially when they showed the episode in Season 1 that focused on her and her family. She's a pretty manipulative person. And violent. I'm trying to see where the author tried to go with her, and your explanation kinda helped. Pretty much all the evil things that happened in this anime are to be pointed towards her. Sorta.  My only question is: Where are her parents? You only see her grandparents in the anime.... right?"
Oreimo,2qjmxz,Pl1xpl0x,1 point,Sun Dec 28 03:51:52 2014 UTC,"Sadly I have not yet read the Light Novels so I can't really talk about what's written there...

The author wanted a Kirino ending, but like you guys have said, the publisher didn't want the series to end on an incest note.  However, we get the consolation of knowing that the author did indeed want this ending, and implies they are in fact still together, just not publicly. Its just a shame we can never get any confirmation from the anime or novels themselves due to the publishers and producers."

Oreimo,2qjmxz,Hawkki,7,Sat Dec 27 18:30:59 2014 UTC,Just because the publishers did not want the negative publicity of an incest ending does not make it against the law...

Get pissed off - then read this http://pastebin.com/g1awYmW4  Then go read the light novels, and realise that the author couldn't really have the ending he wanted due to censorship/publisher concerns.  He confirms in interviews what we all suspect though."

Oreimo,2p5zvf,Pl1xpl0x,1 point,Sat Dec 13 13:11:33 2014 UTC,"My understanding is that the ending-change was from the original LNs, they wouldn't have been published if he kept the original ending."
Oreimo,2p5zvf,captain_cornflakes,3,Sat Dec 13 14:20:13 2014 UTC,"the ending of the anime is pretty much the same as the LN. Only difference is that while they're shopping at Akiba at the end Kirino asks Kyosuke to buy her a merchandise ring to which he asks why he should and she responds since they're siblings there is nothing wrong with it (small detail, but significant). And of course the infamous last kiss didn't happen on the cheek like in the anime but on the mouth, to which Kyosuke in return responds that it's ok since they're siblings.  You can lookit up here if you want  In the after story it's furthermore heavily implied they're still together as Kuroneko calls Kirino out on bragging about her love life."

Oreimo,2nwn3d,Hawkki,3,Tue Dec 2 11:22:49 2014 UTC,It is the best possible ending considering Kirino ended up with Kyousuke anyway (confirmed on later readings)
Oreimo,2nwn3d,Kidbuu543,7,Tue Dec 2 15:21:58 2014 UTC,"best possible ending   No.   My personal opinions are as follows: More Kyousuke and Kuroneko, Kyousuke and Kuroneko ending better, more Saori, Manami being less of a fucking cunt to Kirino, less Kanako, more Sena.   What I think would have been best for the fanbase and the show in general: 3-4 seasons, multiple episodes of Kyousuke and Kuroneko being in a relationship, not just on dates. Half a season of Kyousuke and Kirino being together.   For the climax of the show, Kyousuke and Kirino's relationship was extremely disappointing. Besides the christmas scene and the wedding scene nothing really changed. The reaction of the game club was extremely satisfying, I wish there was more of the game club interacting with Kirino.   The final split up wasn't really bad, it was a perfect realistic interpretation and was probably one of the best ways to handle the end of the show. I wish there was another episode after they split up so that we could see the reactions to their separation, since it kinda left it to the imagination, which I don't really like.   Manami's reaction was really emphasized, while the whole relationship was kind of glossed over, emphasizing just the beginning and end. This made the relationship seem like something which caused a lot of damage, which it surely did, but didn't amount to much besides a confession, which it hopefully didn't.   All in all I think the key points to the ending were decently good, though logistically the ending was handled very poorly. The screen time and effort were poorly distributed, and made a very lopsided ending.   I think the lopsidedness and extremely condensed ending is what angered most people, it's definitely what angered me."
Oreimo,2nwn3d,CaptainAnon,6,Mon Dec 1 04:36:40 2014 UTC,Supposedly there are side stories which show what happened after the series.
Oreimo,2nwn3d,luacs1998,2,Mon Dec 1 05:12:22 2014 UTC,I'm really looking forward to the after story artbook. I'm just starting the PSP game.
Oreimo,2nwn3d,CaptainAnon,2,Mon Dec 1 05:31:54 2014 UTC,Is it possible to find the PSP game in English somewhere?
Oreimo,2nwn3d,Neosword3000,3,Mon Dec 1 13:47:01 2014 UTC,Yes.
Oreimo,2nwn3d,CaptainAnon,4,Mon Dec 1 16:37:48 2014 UTC,I am sad that you posted that link.
Oreimo,2nwn3d,DizzyZiddy,3,Tue Dec 2 03:19:53 2014 UTC,"I'm not for pirating games either... unless they're in Japanese on a system that I don't have, and have no chance of being officially translated into English. In that case, there is no legal way for me to enjoy the game without spending years to become fluent in Japanese, so I'll opt to pirate an English patched version. I think that's reasonable."

Oreimo,2nwn3d,Neosword3000,3,Tue Dec 2 03:39:47 2014 UTC,"I totally agree that the pacing of the end was weird. I was really talking about the way the show wrapped up in terms of Kirino and Kyousuke's relationship, which satisfied me."
Oreimo,2nwn3d,CaptainAnon,1 point,Mon Dec 1 05:30:22 2014 UTC,"I agree that the end of their relationship was one of the best ways to do it, I was just summarizing the end in general."
Oreimo,2nwn3d,Neosword3000,1 point,Mon Dec 1 05:44:43 2014 UTC,"When someone says best possible ending they usually just mean the fact that Kirino and Kyousuke  end up together + breakup/secret relationship which was a sad yet a  good and  realistic approach. Probably everyone would agree with you concerning the pacing.   I wish there was another episode after they split up so that we could see the reactions to their separation, since it kinda left it to the imagination, which I don't really like.   Well there is a  bit source material just not enough sadly. We can  dream about a proper after story and a respectable OVA about it but I don't have high hopes of this."
Oreimo,2nwn3d,luacs1998,2,Mon Dec 1 16:50:23 2014 UTC,"I agree. The only thing that would have made it better is if he got back together with Kuroneko...  But in all seriousness, an incestual relationship just couldn't work out in modern day Japan without them detaching themselves from all of their family and friends. They were clearly in love, so the other ships just weren't going to happen. It really had the best ending it could have had."

I personally only read  a small part of the first volume but I also tried the Manga adaption which turned out way better than the Oreimo adaption  in my opinion, I enjoyed it a lot so far. Concerning the anime adaption: Nothing got announced yet but there was  this poll crunchyroll wrote about so  it is not too unlikely. Right now we still have to wait for quite some time since there are only 3 volumes released so far.   You find the  first Oreimo after story on bakatsuki together with the bonus novel from the BR/DVD and several other things. Another one is planned for 2015."
Oreimo,2nve09,brayfurrywalls,2,Mon Dec 1 18:20:32 2014 UTC,"Oh lol i missed this comment, sorry! So what you reffered about ""not too unlikely""? Itll probably get an anime? Or not?  I hope that they do some Ovas from afterstory, but to be realists... Hm they wouldnt probably.. But well lets give  it a try , and thanks for the links :)"

As vuvoo said, the LNs will give you more insight as to what the characters were feeling and thinking.

I'll come back in reading these pastebins when I'm done with the LN.  I don't want to spoil the differences between the LN and the anime. Thanks again!"
Oreimo,2n5sda,Kousaka-Kyousuke,4,Mon Nov 24 03:23:27 2014 UTC,"First of all thanks for stating your opinion with actual arguments and not  the typical "" MY GRILL DIDN WIN SHIT ANIMU"".   But why did they decide to break everything off after a short while instead of ending there?   I think by now someone already pointed this out  on /r/animesuggest  but this is an S-class response on this subreddit  oh well... So I am too lazy to search for all sources ( someone else hopefully does this) but while reading/watching the ending you have to keep in mind that the author was confronted with several  issues which prevented him from writing the ending he wanted to:   I guess so. I wrote so that it would have scenes that felt like those in volume 1. With Dengeki Bunko [Fushimi's publisher], it was very difficult to write a thrilling story in which they settle everything and head down a forbidden path. I was sure I would give Kirino a happy ending, so I did my best to set up as good a situation for her as possible, for the sake of her future. I found it very difficult to do so. It ended up the way you read it [in volume 12], but if I were to add a few unnecessary comments for those readers who are reading it for a second time, I would say:   ""A Completely Kirino Ending""  ""The story ends with the two siblings sharing a secret, the same way their first life-advice-talk [jinsei soudan] began.""    So what do we have: No full incest for us because Muuuh society norm Muuuh reputation of publisher and instead we got this version. I guess we can all agree now that "" sharing a secret"" basically means that they have their sexy time in private while acting like normal siblings on the outside. But to be honest this is a really great ending on its own. I know not many of you will agree with me  (and full Kirino would have been like the first christmas, birthday and sex combined for me) but the bitter-sweet taste of a love that has to be kept secret because society would never approve it adds a certain drama to it. For me, this adds a pretty sad undertone into an actual happy ending.  Overall I also disagree with many of your observations."" Pushing their friends away "" ""Going on with the charade"", this is probably exactly what they did not want but at the same time what they wanted to have, would result in certain inevitable things. To make a short reproduction of how i experienced things when watching it the first time maybe this helps you enjoying the ending a bit more :D: Kyousuke could have had everyone else if he wanted to. Ayase, Ruri and whoever else, they could have been the easy way out and come on our Kyousuke could have fucked a model with a naughty secret, therefore simply doing what more than half of the male world population dreams about. But no wait, there is a person he truly loves. A person he loves enough to choose the uncomfortable way, so he takes the risk, dumps every girl just to confess to his own sister,(YES HIS BLOOD RELATED SISTER GOD FORBID) oh shit this is societal suicide and he did not even know whether she feels the same way. So Kyousuke does not give a fuck and he surpassed the point of being ashamed to call himself a siscon a long time ago. He reaches out to Kirino, she feels the same way, they are happy, they even think about marrying, dem feelz everywhere  ( me being a crying little schoolgirl at this point) but soon the harsh reality punch them in their faces and they suddenly realize they can probably never live a normal couple life and they may even lose all of their friends and family. But they still don't give a fuck (related) and show us that true love is stronger than any obstacle ( this f*ckin romantic shit  gets me all the time q.q). They reach out to their friends because they obviously do not want to lose them at all and they gladly support them but Kirino x Kyousuke  realize that the society is shit and their worries were more than justified. This is when they choose to keep their feelings in secret, exclusively for them in order to save their relationship.  So yeah I could hopefully change your mind and if you are really interested in the story and like reading you should definetly check out the LN and maybe if you are still unsatisfied with the ending the after story first . Well thats it welcome to the subreddit enjoy your stay and feel free to contribute :)."

Same feel as oreimo? Hard to say.. I guess everyone feels something different huh?^ Oreimo was my third anime (I'm still new to it) and so far there was nothing just like it that felt like it.. but I watched alot of other great animes that gave me the feels too so.. yea..  My recommendation: check out ""sakurasou no pet na kanojo""."

Oreimo,2ms96t,luacs1998,3,Thu Nov 20 00:43:30 2014 UTC,Try Toradora! and Nisekoi.  Those are the two shows I've seen which feel the most like Oreimo to me (Toradora being the most similar.)
Oreimo,2ms96t,RPG720,3,Wed Nov 19 23:26:38 2014 UTC,Nisekoi? Similar? Help me understand...
Oreimo,2ms96t,Kousaka-Kyousuke,2,Thu Nov 20 02:05:01 2014 UTC,"Similar intros, and its also a sort of rom-com if that makes any sense.. Which Oreimo was in the last part as far as I could tell."

Oreimo,2ms96t,KisukeUraharaHat,3,Sat Nov 22 01:14:11 2014 UTC,"I think that Sword Art Online gave a very similar vibe during its second season. Probably because it was produced by the same people. Anyway, I actually liked it significantly more than Oreimo."

I'm not even mad that my favourite didn't get picked, I accept who the writers choose in that situation, but I don't accept them setting it up so that you could just go back to the first episode right after the ending of the s2-specials and nothing really changes. Made the whole effort seem for naught.   Luckily, I took a little sit at the end of just the second season, and that made for a perfectly acceptable ending, so if I ever do rewatch, that is where I will be stopping."
Oreimo,2miez8,Linard,5,Mon Nov 17 03:00:10 2014 UTC,"took a little sit at the end?  Do you mean you looked up the whole screwup of the ending caused by the publishing company of the LN?  Because that is what everyone should do, especially when you're unsatisfied by the ending."
Oreimo,2miez8,White_sama,3,Mon Nov 17 12:18:38 2014 UTC,"Oops, should've reread that line, it's worded funny.   I meant to say that I took a small break to get food after finishing episode 13 of season 2, last seasonal episode before the 3 speicals, and contemplated that ending as if it was the actual ending.   Then I went on to watch the last 3. I had looked up the 3 specials pre season 2 I think, saw that people didn't like them, and saw the one post about stopping it at 21:12 and never looking back.   Which I promptly ignored and figured, ""Hey it can't be too bad."" Curiosity kills the cat I suppose. This ending was second worst I have expierenced, second only to Kage Kara Mamoru."
Oreimo,2miez8,White_sama,2,Mon Nov 17 12:25:42 2014 UTC,"How bad was that?  Also they stay together actually. It's been confirmed by the author, but he just couldn't put it in the book. Because you know, siblings making babies doesn't go well with normals."

Oreimo,2mbmsu,pablomu,3,Sat Nov 15 04:03:01 2014 UTC,How dare you defile my waifu with your dirty penos you scum D:

Oreimo,2mbmsu,White_sama,2,Sat Nov 15 20:09:00 2014 UTC,I like you.
Oreimo,2mbmsu,Kirino_Kousaka,2,Sat Nov 15 20:20:34 2014 UTC,i like you too
Oreimo,2mbmsu,White_sama,2,Sat Nov 22 13:37:05 2014 UTC,"I like you too, except I think you made a mistake: kirino is MY waifu"
Oreimo,2mbmsu,sagrado_corazon,2,Sat Nov 15 21:11:47 2014 UTC,Nice
Oreimo,2m78q4,rancor1223,6,Thu Nov 13 18:11:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah that's pretty much it if I remember right. The reason why the genre is called visual novels is because they are for the most part just that, a novel that has visuals.  IIRC: How you effect the story (from what little of the game I've played) seems to be determined by what you decide to do or say at certain points. You decide what to DO when there is a little thing (or multiple things) in the corner of the screen with a button next to it, you either just keep going through the dialogue or use that thing, so for example ""You are currently in the locker room waiting for Ruri, you could go and see if she's in her classroom by clicking this button in the top left or don't and just stand here waiting"". You decide what to SAY at those QTE points you mention, I don't know if it is just a system of 'press the buttons for the girl you're going for and nobody else' or not. There's also points where you decide what to say in the same way that you decide what to do, when things come on the corner of the screen you either choose to use it or don't."
Oreimo,2m78q4,Desertmoongw,1 point,Thu Nov 13 23:04:59 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed 2 kinds of QTEs. One appears in regular dialog and I have to press Left Arrow (or at least there hasn't been different one yet) and then square.   And then there is the one in section when I'm talking to just one of the girls and dialog continues automatically. And there are from time to time option to press square. There actually seem to do something (because when I went trough one with Kirino and pressed square every time, Ruri was pissed, and the same happened when I did the same in Ruri's solo dialog and it made Kirini pissed).  What I would expect would be several of these QTEs at one time where I could choose which to get, but I haven't seen that happen yet. But maybe it's just too early. Well, I will give a try again today."
Oreimo,2m78q4,Scyl,2,Fri Nov 14 07:40:04 2014 UTC,"Keep in mind that not all VN are the same, most of them have dialogue tree, but oreimo is a special one, I have only seen video of oreimo VN, so I am not too sure how it works"

Oreimo,2m78q4,pablomu,2,Fri Nov 14 07:52:20 2014 UTC,"Clannad is good, fairly domestic but with a nearly invisible thread of supernaturality and redemption.  Never 7 is honestly the best visual novel I have ever played, but I'm biased towards anything with time travel/groundhogs day type stuff going on  Fate Stay/Night is a really good action VN that has a story that you think is weird until you're somehow sucked in and you never leave again.  Regardless, have fun!"
Oreimo,2m78q4,DizzyZiddy,2,Fri Nov 14 10:28:07 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that when /u/TrustMeIGotHaki see this, he'll help you, only if you don't want to go for kirino route"
Oreimo,2m78q4,DizzyZiddy,1 point,Fri Nov 14 02:42:42 2014 UTC,"Haha, I definitely don't want to go for Kirino's route. My plan is to go for the Ruri route. I'm not really interested in any other, I would just like this to be my ending to the story."
Oreimo,2m78q4,DizzyZiddy,2,Fri Nov 14 07:31:28 2014 UTC,"Plot branches are determined by the O.R.Es that you select and your choices in TwoShot events.  For example, attending the Siscalypse Tournament will put you on the path of Kirino / Kuroneko / Saori, while skipping it will put you on the path of Ayase / Manami.  It's not exactly Quick Time Events but more like ""I want Kyousuke to say this by pressing square!"" in the TwoShot events."
Oreimo,2m78q4,DizzyZiddy,1 point,Sat Nov 15 12:56:06 2014 UTC,"I think I understand now. I played a bit more today and got to the point where I could actually choose between two options.   Sadly, it seems like quite a big part of translation is still missing, so I guess I will have to wait for it to be completed. Especially in Kuroneko's route which is the only one I'm really interested in."
Oreimo,2m78q4,Kousaka-Kyousuke,1 point,Sat Nov 15 13:24:01 2014 UTC,"The Kuroneko/Kirino/Ayase routes are fully translated though, so if you end up in some weird untranslated place it means you're in the wrong route."
Oreimo,2m78q4,Acyy,1 point,Sun Nov 16 00:32:24 2014 UTC,"Welp. Could you point me to a place where I could get the version you are talking about?  I'm not even sure where I got mine, but I found this site and they have Kuroneko's route listed as not completed."
Oreimo,2m3ooh,sagrado_corazon,3,Wed Nov 12 19:42:39 2014 UTC,"Awesome dude, how much was all this?"
Oreimo,2m3ooh,White_sama,2,Wed Nov 12 20:04:06 2014 UTC,It was about 9640 Yen (~ 67 Euro) for the LNs +Artbook and  7090 Yen (~49 Euro)  for the shipping if i remember correctly.
Oreimo,2m3ooh,Timae09,3,Wed Nov 12 20:17:27 2014 UTC,That's... Cheap.
Oreimo,2m3ooh,White_sama,1 point,Wed Nov 12 21:28:38 2014 UTC,"To be honest, I could have get the shipping way cheaper but I chose the FedEx International alternative, which was one of the more expensive options, for several reasons."

Oreimo,2m3ooh,brayfurrywalls,1 point,Wed Nov 12 23:24:32 2014 UTC,Sure thing. I got mine from www.cdjapan.co.jp/ I checked the shipping cost for the LN only and for the LN plus Artbook to the US and Germany.  You can also get them on amazon or even a Bundle  even though the website is not fully translated in english mode
Oreimo,2m3ooh,Pl1xpl0x,2,Thu Nov 13 02:10:28 2014 UTC,"Welp, time to learn japanese. Thanks friend."

Is it worth it to buy that one as well? I mean, I usually don't buy anime stuff (sad student cant afford everything -.-) so I don't know what an artbook really is. Are there like pictures and artwork from OreImo inside or what is it like?"
Oreimo,2m3ooh,Echetleos,1 point,Wed Nov 12 23:28:03 2014 UTC,"Mainly colored Illustrations and monochrome galleries. OreImo takes a big part of the book but also other stuff from the illustrator like  Neko-Sis. Additionally an Interview and the After Story of course. It was a must have for me because i really love stuff like this(+more Oreimo illustrations  = more win :3), so it really depends on you. The price was about 2800 Yen."

Oreimo,2lp26p,Personalife,1 point,Sun Nov 9 00:27:42 2014 UTC,This is the closest I could find. The vocals seem to be a bit different and overpower the melody.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzK9BHVUa20

Oreimo,2lptd7,Wingzeroalchemist,6,Sun Nov 9 00:29:42 2014 UTC,"I mean, i expected he would just leave the other girls just to take care of Kirino or something like that, but i didnt expect him to fall in love with her..."
Oreimo,2lptd7,Chorizwing,1 point,Sun Nov 9 00:33:01 2014 UTC,"I'm with you there, I would have really prefered an ending that represented  Kirino and Kyosuke as great sibilings without the insest deal. Still I say up until episode 13 you really weren't sure. It could have easily gone the other way and not shown them as lovers, but I guess it wasn't a bad ending and this anime was easly going on my top 10 since the first episode."
Oreimo,2lptd7,cpsayhi,2,Sun Nov 23 18:00:08 2014 UTC,"I honestly thought, for the majority of my viewing experience, that the theme the title implies is that Kyousuke's sister and his relationship with her was one of friendship. The way I saw it was that the show was going to focus on mending the relationship they had before Kirino's disappointment began. More on the progression of just two siblings becoming loving family again. But the ending kinda confuses me even as someone who doesn't ship Kiririn. A prevalent theme in the earlier episodes was trying to become someone unashamed of the things they love. (i.e. the imouto eroge/Kyou D) However, when they get together they end it almost immediately because it's not part of an acceptable societal norm. ?"
Oreimo,2lptd7,somone77,12,Fri Dec 12 00:39:52 2014 UTC,Obligatory

Oreimo,2lptd7,ifkb99,2,Sun Nov 9 10:04:25 2014 UTC,"What make me angry is how damn noncommittal they are about it. Why couldn't they not have told anyone, and then just have had normal lives if they didn't want to make it last?"
Oreimo,2lptd7,Lazuli_Blue,2,Mon Nov 10 12:21:50 2014 UTC,I know the feeling.
Oreimo,2lptd7,Wingzeroalchemist,2,Sun Nov 9 00:18:37 2014 UTC,"This again? They did want to make it last. The author did everything he could to imply that they kept it up in secret after they ""broke up"" but he could only do so much because of his editor and publisher. Despite how weird Japan may seem, the general Japanese society don't actually approve of incest. It wouldn't have gotten published. In the Light Novels the kiss is supposed to be on the lips, and the short ""after story"" released a couple months ago has Kuroneko calling out Kirino for bragging about her love life, to which Kirino looks at Kyousuke and starts blushing and stammering.  That was the entire purpose of Kirino telling Kyousuke that their life counseling wasn't over.  Rant End Please don't take this as a personal attack. It's not. It's just frustrating to need to repeat this."
Oreimo,2lptd7,Kidbuu543,2,Mon Nov 10 15:11:43 2014 UTC,Read http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Ore_no_Im%C5%8Dto_ga_Konna_ni_Kawaii_Wake_ga_Nai:A_Momentary_Chance_Encounter  Pretty much confirms Kirino ending

Oreimo,2lbq1q,Wingzeroalchemist,4,Wed Nov 5 12:03:34 2014 UTC,"Because Ruri is second banana to Kirino. Thus Kirino plays first banana in the cosplay.  I wonder who first came up with the whole ""second banana"" but anyway."

Oreimo,2l904n,DJLTheFirst,8,Wed Nov 5 22:19:02 2014 UTC,Too bad but the result was to be expected. Our Lord and Saviour aka. truebestgirl aka. (our beloved goddess) Kirino is just too much to handle for the common ruri pleb. If you can't win the real battles we let you have the small ones!!
Oreimo,2l904n,sagrado_corazon,9,Wed Nov 5 09:08:38 2014 UTC,"Cool, although the real battle has already been won by Kirino aka best girl."
Oreimo,2l904n,JudgeRicand,6,Tue Nov 4 17:05:48 2014 UTC,You misspelled Ruri.
Oreimo,2l904n,sagrado_corazon,5,Tue Nov 4 18:02:03 2014 UTC,Go watch the anime/read the light novels ;)
Oreimo,2l904n,JudgeRicand,0,Tue Nov 4 18:07:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah, Ruri is the best girl in those too."
Oreimo,2l904n,sagrado_corazon,6,Tue Nov 4 19:25:18 2014 UTC,2nd place isn't bad.

Oreimo,2l904n,DinTwo,7,Wed Nov 5 19:17:55 2014 UTC,"Let the battle to end all battles begin.   I think that battle was fought and finished somewhere around here. Ruri can have her consolation prize, though, she wins most popularity contests anyways."
Oreimo,2l904n,Wingzeroalchemist,3,Wed Nov 5 06:28:09 2014 UTC,"As a Kirino fanboy, this still hurts. It's a sound I hope to never have to hear from someone I tolerate."
Oreimo,2l904n,White_sama,2,Wed Nov 5 17:10:39 2014 UTC,WOT.
Oreimo,2l904n,Wingzeroalchemist,2,Wed Nov 5 13:56:09 2014 UTC,"It's too bad Ruri will never be Kyosuke's number 1. snap snap  But for real, it's pretty obvious that Ruri is more popular with Oreimo fans in general. And as this is a popularity contest, the results shouldn't be surprising.  I'm just sad that I didn't get to vote for my best girl, the ever adorable Kirino! Was too busy voting in boring old real life.  EDIT: I read the title right when I was listening to ""Back In the Smell of Blood and Gunpowder"". I found that amusing."
Oreimo,2l904n,Fissie,3,Wed Nov 5 17:08:37 2014 UTC,"Actually most of /r/awwnime votes for the moe-est characters, and not for the most popular. If this was a popularity contest, Makise Kurisu wouldn't have lost this early on, as Steins;Gate is probably one of the most popular animes out there. You're right to think that most of these contests are popularity contests, but not this one. Kirino is definitely cute, but she's no match for Ruri."
Oreimo,2l904n,Purper,1 point,Wed Nov 5 19:23:51 2014 UTC,Kirino vs. Ruri definitely has to do with which one is more popular.
Oreimo,2l904n,Fissie,3,Wed Nov 5 19:33:55 2014 UTC,"Not on the /r/awwnime Bracket, it's not. As I said, people vote for the cutest one, not the one they like the most as a character. I'm pretty sure there's at least a few people that like Kirino more than Ruri, but admitted that Ruri is cuter and voted for her. If you don't believe me, visit the discussion threads from time to time."
Oreimo,2l904n,Fissie,2,Wed Nov 5 19:37:44 2014 UTC,Ruri needs to beat out super bitch. I'm glad you agree with me.  Literally all I care about today is making sure that Kirino does NOT win.    Yeah it is just about being cute i see :D
Oreimo,2l904n,Purper,3,Wed Nov 5 21:34:57 2014 UTC,"most of /r/awwnime   Yes, there's assholes in every group of people. Your point? I said ""most"" not ""all"".  Edit: And it's also a competition, of course there's going to be some trash talking."
Oreimo,2l904n,Fissie,1 point,Wed Nov 5 22:58:45 2014 UTC,"Thing is, most of the people who've watched Oreimo will vote for who they liked more (especially seeing as cuteness is, for both of them, a strong point) and as you said, there are people who think one's cuter despite liking the other, that goes both ways. Ultimately, it's about how many people like which character more."
Oreimo,2l904n,Purper,3,Wed Nov 5 19:41:51 2014 UTC,"It goes both ways, but apparently more people voted for Ruri over Kirino than Kirino over Ruri, which is why she won."

Here's a summary of the survey results for this subreddit and the thread where people discussed the results. It started with me questioning the guy to girl ratio for this show, but then I figured if I'm going to ask one question, it might be interesting to ask a bunch of other questions related to Oreimo. It was a lot of fun organizing that survey.   So yeah! Girls watch Oreimo. Obviously, I like it, and among my group of friends who enjoy anime/manga, there are some girls who have seen and enjoy the show."
Oreimo,2kv9wf,Akinera,3,Fri Oct 31 11:35:44 2014 UTC,Can't speak for all females but I watch and enjoy Oreimo (sadly haven't seen season 2 yet).    The comedy and art style are what got me hooked.

Oreimo,2jy2j5,sagrado_corazon,2,Wed Oct 22 01:30:49 2014 UTC,Guess I need to take a trip to that book store.

Oreimo,2jy2j5,crozbrobro,0,Wed Oct 22 04:38:03 2014 UTC,"Yea they have everything its like heaven haha. The basement has all stationary and art stuff, middle floor is a regular book store with Japanese novels and literature, but the top floor is everything and anything anime related with even a café selling all your favorite anime/ magna foods (which is reasonably priced and very well made).  I wanted to check out Image nine that day too but they closed to early, how is it?"
Oreimo,2jy2j5,Roflbattleship,2,Wed Oct 22 16:20:32 2014 UTC,Its good. The selection is fair for a retail store. Prices are OK. Its more nice because of how close it is to Penn station and fun to walk around it and see the stuff. I try to hit it up once a month just to see what newer released stuff they have for sale. Its OK in the end worth a stop if you're in the city but nothing mind blowing.  The real good part is the guy that runs it is really nice and usually remembers you.
Oreimo,2jy2j5,Sakai-Yuji,1 point,Wed Oct 22 20:13:45 2014 UTC,"That sounds cool, definitely gotta check it out next since its right by the station anyway why not lol. I'm from Long Island so I honestly had no idea we had access to such stores until recently, I spent so much in the city >_<.

Oreimo,2jobst,mundozeo,2,Sun Oct 19 07:18:33 2014 UTC,"There are a lot of resources on it, but the ending is (and always has been) a full Kirino ending. Their relationship in a public view is over, but their relationship continues in secret. Their ""life counseling"" as Kirino mentions at the closing of the show after the kiss on the cheek. Otherwise, their future is as unknown to them as it is to us.  The reason the ending is written that way is because the publishers did not allow the author to write the ending as it was originally envisioned. So the author wrote in such a way that was subtle, but still allowed by the publisher, which is why things are only implied.  The after story continues to imply their relationships continue as they are from the end of the anime/LN series.

Oreimo,2jobst,Histy,1 point,Sun Oct 19 16:25:10 2014 UTC,"Ok, I guess that sort of makes sense, but then it does mean their relationship will continue in secret until at some point it becomes known and they face the consequences (and endure through them I assume).   It sucks it has to only be ""implied"" and ""suggested"" instead of having an actual series closure.   I mean, for example in Gurren Lagan, I didn't like the ending that much, but at least it had clear closure, I can accept it for what it is. In Macross Frontier there's also more closure and much more evident hints (and after images in the form of official illustrations) of what happened.  And I keep hearing about how the author envisioned it but can't find a source on it. Is this really true or did it come off from the internet's word-of-mouth?  Still a great series and much worth the journey. Thanks for the reply."
Oreimo,2jobst,Histy,2,Sun Oct 19 16:37:59 2014 UTC,"It comes from various interviews where it is implied that he had to rewrite the ending due to content and that he was a bit disappointed with how the ending was animated (especially the cheek instead of the lips part that the author insisted on).  But an author isn't going to ruin his relationship with his publisher over something like that, so his frustrations aren't directly mentioned outright. It is a touchy subject and you could also understand why Dengeki might have issues publishing something about two blood-related siblings that go beyond a sibling relationship (especially if it becomes one of their popular series)."

Wow, thanks for the does of feels. Haha, but yeah, I was in the same situation as you, the ending really got me down, not because of the content of it, but because I couldn't comprehend the fact the show was over, which no other form of media did for me, as you said.

Oreimo,2iswe8,DinTwo,5,Thu Oct 9 23:54:59 2014 UTC,"Well, I wouldn't say she looks ""exactly"" like Manami. The hair colour is different, Manami's hair seems to be slightly longer and I would say that the glasses are a tad thicker and further up on her nose.  There are many similarities, but just looking at the scene, many people would not notice it so I'd assume it was the animators being lazy. Also, there are only a limited amount of lets call it ""character stereotypes"" like the girl with the ponytail, the....lets call her hipster with her hat and the scarf thing and then the girl with the short hair. The hair colours are mostly used so that they fit in in OreImo (a lot of dark colours for side-characters).  So...I'd say this is just laziness ^"
Oreimo,2iswe8,Pl1xpl0x,5,Fri Oct 10 00:01:34 2014 UTC,Thaaat...doesn't look like Manami
Oreimo,2iswe8,terranq,3,Fri Oct 10 02:57:32 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the subtle hair differences and how the glasses are pretty different is what gives it away. Close, but no cigar."

Oreimo,2io289,AdiDassler,2,Wed Oct 8 16:04:08 2014 UTC,Do you have a sharper version of this? It kinda looks blurry because of the lighting I suppose.
Oreimo,2io289,SamMee514,2,Wed Oct 8 17:49:31 2014 UTC,I think that's how the actual frame was in the show. The artists used a lot of that sort of soft lighting.
Oreimo,2io289,Pl1xpl0x,2,Wed Oct 8 23:52:40 2014 UTC,I personally would go with the left one. Noone beats cute Ayase. Not even tsundere Ayase when she's very tsun (can you say that? ^ )
Oreimo,2io289,weinerpalooza,4,Wed Oct 8 16:43:34 2014 UTC,yandere
Oreimo,2io289,Pl1xpl0x,1 point,Wed Oct 8 19:14:58 2014 UTC,"Well, yandere and tsundere are quite different and im 99% sure one would describe Ayase as tsundere, not yandere. That said, I re-read what I wrote and I meant Ayase when she's very ""dere"" not ""tsun"".  Or did you mean yandere Ayase beats cute Ayase? Well, then I disagree :-D"
Oreimo,2io289,weinerpalooza,3,Wed Oct 8 19:42:19 2014 UTC,"both  i'm pretty sure in the anime she's called yandere, tsundere is more kirino  also yandere > cute"
Oreimo,2io289,Pl1xpl0x,-2,Wed Oct 8 19:58:27 2014 UTC,"hm, okay, read the definition of yandere again and looks like I kinda missed the crucial part so yes, you are prolly right about her being more yandere than tsundere.   But that is not what I was actually asking about. ""deredere"" stands for being in love, flirty, that kind of stuff. ""yanderu"" stands for being sick and ""tsuntsun"" stands for more like grumpy. So what I was asking is whether you can refer to just the cute, flirty ""dere"" part by saying she is ""dere"" or whether thats not possible (like saying you like the ""tsun"" part about Kirino etc, you get my point)"

Oreimo,2ifim0,Axxl1,1 point,Mon Oct 6 13:31:15 2014 UTC,"Maybe they mean relating to having to hide the fact that you are interested in something that others consider not cool which yeah most can relate to. Unless they are implying that an interest in anime equates to autism then that's just bullshit.   Though Kirino's level of OBSESSION and fixation yes, could be ranked at an autistic or aspberger-ish level. Don't think she has either though."
Oreimo,2ifim0,Pl1xpl0x,2,Tue Oct 7 02:05:13 2014 UTC,"Yea I've also thought about maybe what he meant was your first idea, but then I really didn't feel like the autism made any sense :-D  I would guess that everyone has a few interests that he/she barely tells anyone, maybe even noone at all about. So, in that sense, I can relate to Kirino :)"

Oreimo,2hfbia,bubbledragonz,1 point,Thu Sep 25 17:39:50 2014 UTC,"That might sound a bit strange, but Oreimo made me not want to learn Japanese. I felt some of Kirino's cuteness might be loss, cause one of the things I loved most about Kirino was her voice.  I, like most anime fans, wanted to learn Japanese for a while, but then lost any motivation to actually try and learn when I realized I didn't desire it enough to warrant the effort it would take. But after Oreimo I didn't want to learn it at all, except for a few phrases that are common knowledge.  TL:DR Kirino's voice is adorable!"

(SAO & Oreimo so far)  The biggest reason that I want to start learning Japanese is to enjoy the original releases (anime, manga, and especially the 'yet-untranslated' light novels) in their original status. Plus, since I'm living in Korea, visiting Japan actually isn't difficult at all for me. I have to be prepared in case I ever do visit!  Also, my lovely angel Ayase-tan best girl all the way."

However, I said that I wanted to   enjoy the original releases (especially the 'untranslated' light novels"")   I want to read the novels in the original language that it was written with, cause I believe that regardless how good the translator may be, there will always be some elements that will be lost through translation.

A tad different, but the anime is really close so far. Just from what I've heard, later on there are huge parts that are left out in the anime.   I find the LN's nice to read so far and really enjoy them, so if you like reading, give them a try. The style is pretty unique (at least I have never encountered any book like that) and quite funny :D"

Yeah, the incest stuff is giving me a weird feeling as well, especially considering that I have a little sister myself, but for me the anime has a completely different meaning.   Episode 12 of season 2 was so amazing! I really really REALLY love it :D"

She has not been ""third-wheeling"" the siblings, she was actually a crucial part in them discovering, but more so actually the reason for them to do something about their relationship. If it were not for Kuroneko, I don't think Kyousuke and Kirino would have ever confessed their love for each other, let alone even talked about the other having relationships etc.   I'm not a Kuroneko fanboy, but still, IMO you have to give her credit where its due."

Oreimo,2gqp9l,Kousaka-Kyousuke,2,Thu Sep 18 17:44:54 2014 UTC,"Everything you wrote, that is exactly how I feel. I can relate 100%. People can laugh at me but to tell the truth, I was so sad and heartbroken after watching the final Episode that I cried for 20 minutes or so. I finished watching it yesterday. Accepting it is too hard, re-watching the last Episode didn’t help but I did it anyway. I also got the PSP VN and played disc 1 of it, seems like we have to wait a little for the english patch for the second disc. I couldn't accept that all they have gone through was only for a short time of Kirino and Kyousuke being together. This couldn't be it! I was depressed to a point I thought to myself ""are you out of your mind, this is only an anime!"" until I happened to read that the author intended the story to end with them actually becoming a real couple. And that the ""we will have a talk at home"" from Kirino after Kyousuke kissing her on the cheek was a hint that they won't stop being lovers and just go on with their love in secret. This helped me a little bit but I will never be satisfied with this ending.  Another thing that I kind of don't get is that there are so many people disliking Kirino.  I also did not like her from the very beginning but after a few episodes I started loving her character, because it was obvious she didn't really hate Kyousuke. I could really imagine the development emotionally, as if I experienced a similar situation.  Then later, after the flashbacks revealed the past and Kirino's true and honest feelings where shown, I couldn't help but letting some tears out. That was when I came to like her even more, like crazy :-)   When I saw Manami punching her and hearing all the things Manami said, plus the ending with them stopping to be a couple, I was like this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1yH7SIOkwU (with me being Vegeta and the one responsible for not letting it go full incest ending being Cell)  It's not that I don't get the guys that wanted Kuroneko to end up with Kyousuke. I really appreciate her character and her selfless act to break up with him, just for the sake Kirino could be happy, etc.  She really deserved a better turn out of things. But if that didn't happen, my favorite pairing would not have happened either (that's obviously KirinoxKyousuke)  Also I don't sympathize with Incest in general, anyway there's no reason for saying oreimo is disgusting. It would be disgusting if Kyousuke raped her or if other things happened. But to call this wonderful, heart-moving story disgusting... My opinion is that this is what mangas, animes and books are for. To tell you the un-obvious, to share emotions and feelings and to change the way you look at things. It does inspire, entertain and connect people. A wonderful thing..  I realize it's ""only an anime"" but the feelings developed while watching it are real feelings.  That's why it hurts so much, ending like this and being over. It's always sad if a manga/ anime is over, I felt like this with Dragonball, TWGOK, Kimi no iru Machi and many others.  But this time, with Oreimo it is the worst, because I ""felt"" this anime more than any other, and the ending is not satisfying for me at all.  I wish I had not seen the last episode, so I could live on with the nice illusions of them being together :/  Now I feel a little better and thank you if you did read all of this :) English is also my second language, so please forgive me for bad grammar etc."

There are other hints but I'm not the best person at explaining."

I couldn't ask for a better ending than that one! ( I was kinda hoping to see Ayase at the last episode )."

He could have just picked one of the other girls (I was more of an Ayase fan) if they wanted to go with a ""realistic"" ending. Sorry for the rant.  Anyways, usually after finishing an anime I wait a day or more (until the ""depression"" is gone lol) and then find another.

Reasons:   More stories More detail and content on the stories that got into the anime Better glimpses into Kyousuke's inner dialogues Many more hours of entertainment out of the series (unless you're a super fast reader) The art that goes with the LNs is really nice, too. One of the volumes is all about presenting a perspective of the setting through other characters' points of view.   After you're done with the LNs, you should also read the bonus stories, such as the Valentine's Day story, a short excerpt detailing something that occurred with Kyousuke and Kirino before the start of the series, the After Story, and - my personal favorite - a retelling of the first chapter of the entire series from Kirino's point of view."

Kuroneko and Rikka are completely different characters in completely different circumstances, and you can't just go and be like ""oh Kyousuke x Kuroneko didn't work out so just go watch Rikka x Yuuta because both Kuroneko and Rikka are chuunibyous so Rikka x Yuuuta would be a good replacement.""   Is the faux-wedding scene is an anime-original ending, or the actual ending in the light novel?   It's the actual ending in the LNs. For heaven's sake this was asked and answered like 23965872689 times in this subreddit   I get that it's there to keep the possibility of a season 3 open,    The LN series is over and the possibility of season 3 coming out is almost non-exsistent.   I was hoping that KyouxKirino wasn't solely based on revenge.   It is not.   Kanakana's confession felt tacked on, if simply to round out the harem.   Are you referring to episode 14 of season 2 Kyousuke's confession to Kuroneko? It was quite rushed to end the series fast in LN volume 12, but it was definitely not tacked on.  .  .  .  ...how drunk were you when you were submitting this..."
Oreimo,2g9zme,DJLTheFirst,3,Sun Sep 14 01:24:32 2014 UTC,"I sincerely hope you are not...   My comment was meant to be taken at face value - if you want to see a show where the non-chuuni gets the chuuni, go watch said show.  By no means did I mean it as ""KyouxKuro failed, so RikkaxYuuta is a great cut-and-paste replacement,"" EDIT: or ""If you want to see KyouxKuro succeed, go watch Chu2koi.""   It's the actual ending in the LNs.   It probably gets brought up so many times because for viewers with no knowledge of the end of the LN, it's a safe and convenient ending.  Now that I know it's the actual end, I do agree that the possibility of a season three is next to nil.   Are you referring to episode 14...   No, episode 15 of season two when he gets a text from Kanakana to meet her a the concert.   ...how drunk were you when you were submitting this...   Quite.  I brought home some nice microbrews, and well, they're all gone now."

Mainly because Kanako only started to reveal some sort of dere to Kyousuke at LN volume 10 and the confession in the volume 12, which isn't quite enough time to make the confession scene seem logical or serious. And also Kanako almost never got as much attention in both the animation and the LNs.  Reddit didn't notify me for getting a response to my comment. Sorry for the late reply :C scumbag Reddit"

Oreimo,2fwqfz,Woowoo_Water,3,Tue Sep 9 14:25:10 2014 UTC,"My thoughts: Ero Manga Sensei is a decent and enjoyable read. Or maybe I'm just biased since I'm hoping this would be just as good as Oreimo.  Reading it felt like it was Tsukasa Fushimi's reflections on being a novelist at times. The cast is a rather lively one, with Elf being the loudest and Sagiri with her random erotic antics.   I'm kind of glad the series isn't a harem, although I really wonder if it is going to devolve into one. The main difference EMS has with Oreimo is that the MC confesses to Sagiri in Vol 1 already, albeit in a roundabout way, and getting rejected (or not?) in a vauge way as well. Who knows how the series will develop as Masamune meets more characters (which I must highlight, are all girls so far). If we stick to Oreimo's formula, eventually he'll start getting involved with each of them in typical romcom romance ala second part of Oreimo towards the end. After all, you've got your bookstore childhood friend, your novelist archenemy/admirer, your loudmouth attractive novelist and of course, your sister.  Looking forward to Vol 3."

I mean, it depends on what exactly you want to write (like rating K / T / R and with pairing / without and that kind of stuff), but my own child putting time into something creative that they like would be something that I would encourage. Now I don't know your parents, but ... there has to be a way to present them your plan so that they should approve, right? If you need or want any help, I'd love to help you, if there is a way for me to do so.   If you don't want to talk here, but keep talking in general, pm me if you like ^"

Oreimo,2fbm2u,Pl1xpl0x,1 point,Wed Sep 3 15:48:56 2014 UTC,"At my old company, it was easy to find a commercial laser printer that could easily do this and bind it for me. Unfortunately, limited access to printers at new work. I wonder how much a copy shop would charge to print and bind this. I think they'd have a problem with it being licensed material?"
Oreimo,2fbm2u,Pl1xpl0x,1 point,Wed Sep 3 15:50:47 2014 UTC,"At my local copy shop it has cost me around €10 to print everything. I binded it myselfe with a white waxed thread, a No. 20 embroidery needle, two small stripes of wide fabric threads and book glue (for the spine). (Around €5)  Then I bought some simple A5 plywood plates and two strong clamps (around €7).  So in the end it has cost me €22 and the next books will only cost around €10 (as I can use the glue, the needle & thread (its 60m long), clamps, ect again)."

Oreimo,2f43vj,mrnicelupe,3,Mon Sep 1 12:18:34 2014 UTC,"Hey, how did you go about learning these languages? I've been trying to learn Japanese but can never decide which resources would be best, free or paid. Would it be worth finding a tutor, instead of attempting to learn alone?  Sorry to jump on you just because you mentioned knowing so many languages, but I imagine I'm not the only one curious!"
Oreimo,2f43vj,xxHikari,2,Mon Sep 1 13:50:30 2014 UTC,"some good starter resources (that i've used/are using) are Human Japanese for Japanese (duh), and Duolingo.com for most Latin based languages (Spanish, French, Italian, etc). Not sure about Chinese, though! /u/xxHikari might know or say something when he responds :3   /u/xxHikari also sounds more experienced than myself in language, so I am eager to hear how he learned as well!"
Oreimo,2f43vj,Kelzo_,2,Mon Sep 1 14:13:34 2014 UTC,"I've never personally had a tutor but was immersed. Get some language learning buddies and consume as much media as you can. It's going to take hard work no matter what. I forced myself to read easier manga, watch raw anime, play my favorite games in Japanese alongside a dictionary, and listened to all my favorite music. This is a form of immersion and it really does help. Books helped with the basics but I couldn't stick to them. Good luck man."
Oreimo,2f43vj,xxHikari,1 point,Tue Sep 2 13:47:02 2014 UTC,"Is it easier to study japanese after learning chinese? I was in a chinese school back when I'm elementary and High School because I have some blood of me that's chinese but I didn't want to because it was a pain in the ass for me back then. Does it reduce time in learning words that is kanji or it doesn't really matter? I would get really pissed if learning chinese will make learning japanese easier because I'm currently learning japanese by using a learning software, Rosetta Stone and it's kinda hard."
Oreimo,2f43vj,Kelzo_,2,Tue Sep 2 13:18:14 2014 UTC,"It helps with some stuff. Not extremely much in the way of grammar. Rosetta stone needs supplements such as media like music, games, anime, whatever you can get your hands on that you like. It reduces the time in learning kanji, but it's kinda tough to Tremens the Chinese pronunciations when you know the Japanese so the sword is a double edged one."
Oreimo,2f43vj,xxHikari,1 point,Tue Sep 2 13:40:52 2014 UTC,Is it ok to start off with Rosetta stone as my first language software as i'm always have my tongue tied with all those long japanese words. Why do I need supplements with rosetta stone? Is it that bad?   Anyways thanks for the reply!
Oreimo,2f43vj,Kelzo_,2,Tue Sep 2 14:38:28 2014 UTC,"Using only one resource can be detrimental, but not always. I think music really helped me with pronunciation as I'm always singing."
Oreimo,2f43vj,xxHikari,2,Tue Sep 2 14:52:17 2014 UTC,"I'm really an avid fan of Japanese music so that would be easier to do, again thanks for the tips man. I just gotta have to fix my tongue being tied by words like  otokonoko or something :/"
Oreimo,2f43vj,Kelzo_,2,Wed Sep 3 01:43:23 2014 UTC,"Just keep chugging along man. Pronunciation is a form of muscle memory, just like guitar playing or martial arts. Once you get it once, it will come more easily the next time, so don't give up."
Oreimo,2f3xzq,Linard,1 point,Sun Aug 31 20:23:16 2014 UTC,"I don't think the light novels have been licensed in the US (I'm not sure if that's where you live or not), but the manga has. You can sometimes find them in the manga section of Barnes & Noble. If you're really desperate to read them, but don't want to sit at a computer I suggest getting a reading tablet, they're relatively inexpensive and are easy on the eyes.  Also if you still want to try printing them out, it shouldn't be too hard to format a .epub into the proper size (they're designed to be dynamic). I'm sure there's a program out there specifically for that"
Oreimo,2f3xzq,chiefnoah,1 point,Sun Aug 31 20:56:20 2014 UTC,Well I've got both a .pdf and .epub file from the translator. And I planned to make the booklet by actually making many little booklets out of 10 A5 sheets (so 20 pages of A6 per part booklet) and then piling them all up and bind them together.  Do you know any program that can make printable A4 files out of it?  So the first sheet has  20 | 1  18 | 3  on one side and on the other side  2 | 19  4 | 17  ect...  Where I then can cut them in two A5 sheets and bind the part booklets out of them.
Oreimo,2f3xzq,chiefnoah,1 point,Sun Aug 31 21:06:53 2014 UTC,"I'm not aware of any at the moment, I'm looking into it. I'll get back to you when I find a solution :D"
Oreimo,2f3xzq,chiefnoah,1 point,Sun Aug 31 21:30:32 2014 UTC,I think I found a semi good solution with PDFBooklet. Well I could make horizontal A5 pdfs with the right two pages together. But he couldn't stack them ontop to make an A4 with four A6 pages in the right order. Because now with those A5 pages I need every odd and even on the same page.  I'm now struggeling with deleting every odd or even page from the pdf so that I have at the end two (one for the front of all sheets and one for the back of all sheets) pdfs. Do you know who to delete pdf pages?
Oreimo,2f3xzq,Kelzo_,1 point,Sun Aug 31 21:58:56 2014 UTC,"I also notice that the .pdf (from baka-tsuki) is already formatted in a A5 size. If you try to reduce the size to A6 the text might become unreadably small (depending on your printer and eyesight). Adobe Reader has a built in option to print out .pdf's in a booklet layout, that way you could avoid all the formatting, though I'm not sure how that would work for binding."
Oreimo,2f3xzq,Kelzo_,2,Sun Aug 31 22:40:34 2014 UTC,"Well after using two different programs to add blank pages before and after the pdf + deleting some (like the pictures from the posters who come with it) and then seperate odd and even ones (for front and back) and then stacking them to have 4 pages on one pdf page to print out, I think I did it. I'll run a test with the first 20 pages and see how it goes.  But what do you mean with that print as booklet layout (I couldn't see any option for that in Acrobat Reader)? And how does this affect the format of the text? I mean it go fancy borders and page numbers. Will it increase the text size? Won't this mess up everything?  Btw I use this version NanoDesu translation as this one provides pdfs for all volumes and not just vol1/2 as baka-tsuki does."

Oreimo,2ewu8t,Linard,20,Fri Aug 29 12:09:56 2014 UTC,"Kirino and Kuroneko are best friends, they know each others' feelings. Kuroneko loved Kyousuke as much as Kirino did, and vice-versa. And ultimately, they treasure their friendship (despite how they act outwardly about it) and do not want to wish ill-will towards the other.  Kirino suffered on her own for the sake of Kuroneko, so her best friend could have a relationship with the person she loved. Because she wanted what was best for Kuroneko. You would be right about the ""becoming aware of their feelings"", because Kuroneko wanted Kirino to be afforded the same opportunities to air out her feelings to Kyousuke, which is why she had been ""setting up"" the entire ordeal.   Kyousuke and Kirino are extremely important people to her, which is why she wanted an ending where they would all be able to get along with each other. With everything out in the open, it avoids the what ifs and the buts about their feelings and the situation. Being open and honest with each other would allow Kyousuke to be able to ""choose"" without dismantling the friendships they had built up. It allowed for them to remain friends, regardless of the decision, which remained true to this day, as their friend circle is still thriving as normal.  It wasn't her ideal ending, but she essentially reached the goal what she was seeking."

I still remember browsing Facebook and seeing a screen shot from episode 2, the ""It's just an anime scene"". Thought it looked pretty cool, so I asked what the show name was. I had to watch it on my tablet, which doesn't have flash player, so I literally spent 2 hours searching for a site to watch it. But it was worth it.  I've seen a lot of anime, but Oreimo is by far my favourite. I just loved everything about it, and it's still the only anime to make me feel empty once it was over. And, it's the only anime which has made want to buy merchandise from it, my small figure collection consists only of Kirino.  I'd give the show a 9/10, it's obviously not perfect, and it's definitely not for everyone, but I loved it.  I've read bits of the LN, but I've never read them through entirely, but I started to a few days ago, and they're great. The anime seemed to make Kirino a bit more hostile towards Kyousuke compared to the LN.   I made a Reddit account just for this sub reddit, and I still visit it daily. I love seeing artwork, and discussions, it keeps the franchise alive, and I'm really grateful that the sub is as active as it is.  So yeah, the show has been over for a year, but I love it as much as ever."
Oreimo,2eq5j5,KirinoMyWaifu,4,Wed Aug 27 14:32:54 2014 UTC,"So your possible gateway to Oreimo was an adult Doujinshi? Now that's something new :D  As I can remember I started watching Oreimo almost after the first season  ended, I was pretty much hooked to ecchi back then and I thought that Oreimo was ecchi so I tried to watch the first episode and have seen this which pretty much made me psych about the series not until after finishing it that I've found out that there is nothing ecchi about the show but I wasn't disappointed about it and for once enjoyed an anime without requiring a box of fan service. I was pretty sure back then that after the last episode that Kirino have some romantic feelings for Kyousuke, you can just feel it. Then after some years the season 2 begun airing but I skipped it because I was into some Dota 2. Not until recently I've rewatched season 1 and finished season 2 + OVA and was disappointed with how the series have ended( I was much more disappointed because maybe I used Commie subs who failed miserably at translating important lines), it left me hanging for days until I tried to go online and found some pretty clever comments in forums that have enlighten me that the ending wasn't that bad and there were some hints and implications that I missed. The season 2 was 4/10 for me because of how it ended but maybe after realizing the hints and implications it's probably about 8.5/10 because the ending was still Kyousuke x Kirino and I'm a Kirino fan myself.   I'm planning on reading the LN next year after I finish rewatching Oreimo, I guess the LN can offer me much more material and extra goodies that weren't included in the series. I created a reddit account just to get into this sub and while obviously other forums or communities out there are pretty dead and that I was pretty late to finish Oreimo that I can't even try to reply to forums that was 10 months old. I'm really thankful that this sub is pretty much alive even after a year Oreimo ended."

I'm planning to play the VN of Yosuga no Sora but Sora's route isn't fully edited yet and it's the only sole reason why I would play the VN."
Oreimo,2eq5j5,Kelzo_,3,Fri Aug 29 01:06:04 2014 UTC,"Ha! I first saw Oreimo from a hentai doujin, too, that's really funny!  I knew Oreimo would be a show I liked, but until about the start of last summer I had kept putting off actually watching the anime. I'm really bad about that, I seem to be a chronic anime procrastinator. But then summer came and I decided the time was now. I had figured that the show must have been long over and done with, but little did I know the second season was still on-going! I naturally flipped; this was the first time I had been up to date on an anime, and I really liked Oreimo! I hit up crunchyroll, and watched the whole show; had to take out the free trial to get the end of season 2. I remember constantly hitting refresh as the last three OVAs were about to be put up. Ten seconds, 5 seconds, 2...!! Great times. Very bittersweet, as it was then end to a very favorite anime-- and what a finale! Well, I still have to read the books! So I guess I'm not totally done with Oreimo just yet.  My first figure was also Kuroneko. I felt that Sweet Lolita was just a bit pricey for me at the time, but I ordered Shironeko in a summer dress, and I'm still very happy with her! Sits right there on the desk. I just ordered Hiro Kanzaki's art book yesterday, too, so the Oreimo merch continues to flow. And of course, the four volumes of the Oreimo manga sit proudly on the bookshelf.  Definitely a 9/10 series, anime-wise; maybe loses a point just because I felt the ending could have had more substance to it. A few more episodes and maybe they wouldn't have had to cut as much as they did. I feel confident enough that the books will leave a 10/10 impression on me, when I manage to read them all. I love Oreimo, no matter how my mood is, whenever I start up episode one, it brings a smile to my face. It's one of my favorites!"
Oreimo,2eq5j5,JupiterCobalt,2,Wed Aug 27 21:30:22 2014 UTC,And I just binge watched yesterday the whole thing in one go and are late for the party =C  But anyway   A gif I saw on /r/anime and a picture with the SAO figures in one scene got me check it out. Loved it most of the time and now after watched it I'm (as always when I finish a series) an empty shell. But I really would have liked to see a bit more of that humor and scenes from the first 5 episodes (and ofc the grandpa!) I would give 9/10 for S1 and 8 for S2. I probably will soon. I'm just late so I have to look through all these posts from top now.
Oreimo,2eq5j5,Linard,1 point,Fri Aug 29 19:43:19 2014 UTC,"Took a completely different route from most people, I'd assume.  Started by reading the LN off BT back in early 2010, before the anime was announced. Really liked the overall premise and felt the story had lots of potential. I was much more intrigued by the story than art, since there was practically no art back then!  That fall, saw the anime and compared it to the few parts of the LN that were translated back then. It was fairly faithful, and definitely went further into the story than the translation status of the LNs back then.  For the Oreimo fans from that era, any of us can say that Seanver's blog was our primary (English) Oreimo mecca. Spoilers/summaries for the released LNs, shots and walkthroughs of the PSP game and more were available.  AnimeSuki posts and two years later, the final season aired. Much rushed, it ruined most of what I'd read from the novels. I was already upset enough at the ""liberties"" they took with the cell phone novel arc in S1, but S2 cranked the decay up to 11.  For the type of story I began Oreimo as back in 2010, I was quite satisfied with the ending. The execution in the LNs have a much more understandable and clean-flowing setting - mostly a satire about hobbies/otaku and social acceptance. From that point of view, the story met its goal - Kyosuke experienced it all and made his decisions, as did every other character to some extent or other. This was clearly illustrated in the LNs. A lot of this was simply cut from season 2.  The Oreimo manga... was not a fan of the art. lol  For merch, I hope to one day have a nice collection of Kirino figures and other related memorabilia. Will post pictures of it, when that day comes... You could say the character designs grew on me.  And, of course, looking forward to the 2nd part of the After Story, as well as other merch releases, the S2 complete blu-ray set, etc.  Finally, following the EMS LNs quite closely, similar to my experience with Oreimo ;)"

The series I was hooked on before Oreimo was Hyouka and my enthusiasm for the series was starting to cool down, so I started looking for another anime to watch. I heard a lot about this ""Ore no Imouto"" and ""My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute"" thing, so I decided to give it a watch. Turns out it was really interesting, and I just kept going. Shortly after, I found the new series to keep me happy for a while (the enthusiasm has cooled down a bit since I finished the anime and LNs, but it's not quite time yet to find another series to binge on). Loved it. I never thought I'd be the type of person who would be into comedies or romances, but Oreimo has showed me otherwise. Yup."

You should also encourage him to be more explicit about his intentions by say, having a title that indicates the story is about siblings, or perhaps introducing incestuous erotic games as a major plot point in the very first episode.  I'm sure he will be absolutely mortified to discover that he didn't write the story exactly how you would've wanted it to go. After all, Oreimo isn't about Kyousuke's growth and decisions, it's about yours."
Oreimo,2ekjah,DinTwo,1 point,Tue Aug 26 04:11:51 2014 UTC,"to quote myself from the other comment, I genuinely thought until that point the show was introducing the siscon eroge as a powerful message that no matter how sexual the content, a sibling relationship is still a sibling relationship, ""we're siblings why is it weird if I see you naked"", I mean he cries when neko dumps him, these all seemed to back up my idea.   and again it's not that i'm unhappy it's not the exact ending I want, I've never seen a perfect ending, the problem for me is that the ending went the exact opposite to the I was interpreting the series, I honestly didn't feel adequately prepared for this relationship to be the outcome."
Oreimo,2ekjah,DinTwo,4,Wed Aug 27 19:05:42 2014 UTC,"I honestly didn't feel adequately prepared for this relationship to be the outcome.   And you probably weren't, as the anime cut 95% of Kyousuke's internal monologue, which made his feelings for Kirino less ambiguous, and also it also trimmed away several scenes that were incestuously suggestive. That part is not your fault. However, you are responsible for searching for evidence to further your preferred pairing while writing everything else off as unimportant, or a sibling relationship. If the only thing you can come up with for why he should've ended up with Ruri is that time he cried, you're not really considering everything else."

Here's reality. A show that's based around satisfying fans' couples will never outright show a romantic relationship such as Oreimo did. Such a show that outright shows or states, ""This pairing is canon and official,"" will lose a majority of its fanbase instantly; the relationships between all characters will be implied and subtle, but never outright. Oreimo isn't that kind of series, although people seem to think it is."
Oreimo,2ekjah,Master__Roshi,1 point,Wed Aug 27 02:20:42 2014 UTC,"I appreciate that, but the point that i'm trying to make is that the choice of the sibling relationship is the exact opposite of what I think the series should have gone for, until that point I thought the show was introducing the siscon eroge as a powerful message that no matter how sexual the content, a sibling relationship is still a sibling relationship, ""we're siblings why is it weird if I see you naked"", I mean he cries when neko dumps him, these all seemed to back up my idea.

Oreimo,2eau9m,Genesis1864,4,Fri Aug 22 18:42:29 2014 UTC,"You're right; there is not going to be a season 3. There are 12 volumes of the LNs. The anime did its best to cover all 12 volumes. There are no other volumes left for any other content. We might, however, get a few bonus features here and there, such as the After Story.  Also, I'm going to agree with DinTwo. Their relationship is in no way back to square one. Remember that the two gave each other the super silent treatment for about 1 year before the start of the series. By the end, even if it looks like Kirino and Kyousuke are trying to get on each others' nerves and messing with each other by the end of the series, that's still a massive improvement from before the start (and, even if you cut out all the incest, that sort of relationship is still closer than many real world siblings' relationships). They're interacting with each other, and they continued to do so after graduation.  Also, you haven't read the LNs? Get to it!!! There are extra stories, and the animated stories also include more details. Besides, the most critical story of them all that reveals how Kyousuke became a lazy, normal-loving guy, and this story is not shown in the anime (also, another cute girl is introduced in this critical story). A few of the stories that made it into the anime were also changed considerably as well (in fact, in one of the stories changed, it's revealed that Kyousuke is willing to give up his life for Kirino. I won't say more than this, though; can't spoil too much)."
Oreimo,2eau9m,mathfreak123,4,Sat Aug 23 02:04:38 2014 UTC,Where they just gave up on their relationship after they graduated.   They didn't.
Oreimo,2eau9m,DinTwo,3,Fri Aug 22 19:57:01 2014 UTC,"Well, they made this whole thing about confessing to each other, and after they graduated, it was like they didn't do it and went back to before they confessed."
Oreimo,2eau9m,DinTwo,6,Fri Aug 22 20:01:36 2014 UTC,"Do you recall how they actually behaved before they confessed? They were basically lovers already, and the kiss in the epilogue is enough to show that nothing really changed.  Even though the anime completely butchered the ending and disagreed with the author on integral aspects of the story, it's all there if you stop taking everything said at face value. The very title of the series is dishonest, as is the centerpiece of pretty much every major plot point. If Kyousuke's telling you they're normal siblings while kissing his sister, you should be able to determine how he really feels.   Besides, if you think what they have at the end of the series is square one, I don't think you remember how bad it was at the beginning. Kirino and Kyousuke dealing with their demons and coming to understand each other is far more important to the story than the title they put on their relationship. It's easy to dismiss complaints about the ending by whining about censorship or pointing to the afterstory that suggests they're still dating, but that explanation is devoid of all the understanding and development that makes the LNs a good story.   It's the progression of Kyousuke from a lazy guy, immersed in normality so that he's never disappointed to one who'll do his best to grab what he wants because he's comfortable with his vulnerabilities and failures that make the ending so fitting. It's Kirino's tendency to self-sabotage in matters regarding her love for Kyousuke mixed with Kyousuke always picking up the pieces when she ends up hurting herself that give sense to Kyousuke breaking the ending promise. The conclusion to the series, which people dismiss as a copout, rides on the themes established throughout the series and is far more well thought out than the canned endings that are typical of these types of stories.   I can only encourage you to read the LNs and see how the dishonesty of Kyousuke's internal monologues progresses. Oreimo is written to be understood in retrospect, but between the anime botching anything remotely subtle and people blinded by the rejection of their favorite character, no one seems to give it any thought."
Oreimo,2eau9m,DinTwo,1 point,Fri Aug 22 21:40:32 2014 UTC,"Sorry, what I mean is that they gave up so much to be together for a few months. They we're together for a few months, from Christmas to graduation, but after that, even though they still feel the same way about each other, they will never act on their feelings again. It'll go back to the ""I need advice"" bit from Kirino, and that will be the extent of their external relationship. They're just going to be brother and sister who have feelings for each other but will never act on them for the rest of their lives. Also, this is just a side note. It also saddens me that, through all they've been though, Manami and Kyousuke aren't friends anymore. I don't care that they didn't get together, it just sucks that their 10 years of friendship just died."
Oreimo,2eau9m,DinTwo,3,Fri Aug 22 21:59:24 2014 UTC,"The afterstory taking place months after the ending has Kuroneko complaining about Kirino bragging about her love life.   I feel that although Manami was a good friend to Kyousuke when he was younger, much of their relationship during and after the cold war was based on Manami wanting Kyousuke to be someone he wasn't and Kyousuke's unhealthy dependance on Manami. It sucks that they're not friends anymore, but Manami didn't like Kyousuke's enthusiasm when he was young and she couldn't deal with it when it returned. Ignoring the whole incest thing for a moment, if Manami doesn't want to be supportive of the person Kyousuke wants to be then perhaps it's best they stop being friends so he can find people who are.   He loses Manami as a friend, who loved him for being normal, but gains Sakurai, who loves him for being himself."

I wouldn't say that the ending is completely different from what you see in the anime+OVAs, but it's just some slight hints and clues that suggest the given ending is really just a cover-up for the author's intended ending where they remain together.  http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Ore_no_Imoto_ga_Konna_ni_Kawaii_Wake_ga_Nai  There are several more extra stories that are completely ignored in the anime (understandable. 12 volumes is quite a bit to fit into 2 seasons, even with 6-7 OVAs on top). Some of the chapters shown in the anime are modified from the LNs, and there are extra details in all the other stories."

Oreimo,2dmkiz,Ghostkatt,23,Fri Aug 15 11:52:01 2014 UTC,"It is two seasons; they do tackle different stories. Season 1 is about how Kirino is able to rely on Kyousuke for her problems. Season 2 is about how Kyousuke is able to rely on Kirino for his problems.  I don't know how you can fault Kyousuke for rejecting someone when he felt that he was not good enough for them and could not provide them the love and attention that he felt they deserved. Especially when his heart was set on someone else; that would not be fair to them at all. He interacted with them enough to know what they saw in him, so it was not without reason.  You could even fault Manami, Ayase, Kanako and Kuroneko for forcing their advances in a vain, thoughtless manner (housewarming party episode). But by that time, Kyousuke had already grown into a person who could make decisions for himself and reacted accordingly to his own confidence. This was something that Kirino was able to bring out in him, something he couldn't do before when others told him how he should think and act. His previous naivety was what forced him into this type of situation in the first place.  When all your focus is on hoping your favorite girl will ""win"", you miss out on some of the best parts of the show."

Once I finished E13 it felt like the entire series was leading up to that flashback, it wouldn't have been so deep if Kirino was nice the entire show. E13 was kind of a gamble, either you'd love Kirino because everything mean she did is justified or you wouldn't care and you'll still wish Kuroneko or Ayase won. I knew Kirino was going to win, as obviously suggested in the title, and I was hating it until E13 softened the blow and made me realize she was best girl all along."

After reading up on every ones post, I have to say, I really felt slapped in the face about the ending. its like the whole chekhov's gun thing. they hinted at the brother sister pairing, and teased us with out going full over board. Then suddenly, like shifting gears in stubborn old car, it suddenly goes into this full on pairing. And then when they FINALLY get to it, it was just like a few moments then it was over. Even when they both knew how they felt about each other and was willing to face the fire, they in the end chickened out.  Lets be honest here, who here would have LOVED to have a ""several years later"" moment where those two are far away from their family and as closed to married as they could get, maybe with a child along the way, and the scene closing with those two and Ruri looking how Ruri drew them in her book."

However, I was always kinda hoping that it wouldn't happen, and when it did happen, it was like they played a game of 7 minutes in heaven and then never did anything about it afterwards. And what happened with Manami and Kyousuke at the end, they had been best friends for 10 years and he just shrugged it off for something that would last a few days after that? I really liked the first season,when both were off doing there own thing but they still hung out etc. And season 2 when she started to help Kyousuke. I knew that the wincest would happen from the start, and I've seen other anime like this, but I don't know. I guess I didn't want it to end like that... I really like OP's idea about the two different stories.   Then again, this is coming from a guy who doesn't usually watch anime like this, even though I did quite enjoy it."

Apparently the light novels go into more detail about the story and characters, but I have yet to read them so I am not sure exactly how much more character development there is.  Everyone I tak to suggests reading the light novel for a more fleshed out story."

Oreimo,2dgylj,Yoshikoo,8,Wed Aug 13 20:23:57 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I've given up on recommending OreImo. Tbh mostly though because I myself have a little sister and you just can not look some1 straight in the face and recommend them an anime that is called ""My little sister cant be this cute"" and tell them what it is about. I can not even describe the plot of the anime without it sounding weird to me, even though I really love it. What I try to emphasize is that it (to me) really is not about an incestious relationship between Kirino and Kyosuke. Yes, that part exists and to some people it may be the main focus of the anime, but to me it is rather about the restorartion of the relationship between Kyosuke and Kirino (in a non-sexual/romantic manner). That is also why I really liked the discussion about Manami here, because you could really discuss her influence on the story.   The worst thing though for me is, that many people, even with my emphasis, a) just will not watch it no matter what and b) IF they watch it they will be extremely prejudiced and only look for ""weird/creepy incest stuff"". I've actually shown the anime to my sister, first only season 1 but then after thinking about it, also season 2 incl the last 3 episodes. Even though she does not think about it the way I do (meaning as in-depth), she understands what it represents for me and why I like it. But that is another question you have to ask yourself: Why and how do you watch the anime? When I watch an anime once, I enjoy it / dont enjoy it and think about it maybe a bit, but only after watching the same anime 2-3-4 times, you can really grasp a lot of what is going on. In season 1 for example, Kirino once says ""Thanks, Aniki."". To me that was an awesome scene in the anime and really meant a lot, to my sister it was nothing until I explained her the meaning of ""Aniki"" and later showed her season 2 so she could really understand what it really means, when Kirino says something like that.  Urgh, this post is too long again, I hope though someone will read it :-D"
Oreimo,2dgylj,Pl1xpl0x,3,Thu Aug 14 02:22:10 2014 UTC,"I read it :). That is pretty much what I think. I have a younger sister as well, and our relationship is pretty much the same as the beginning of the anime (besides the incest), so I can relate to it a lot. It's kinda disappointing that people hearing about this anime don't look past the incest. It's definitely a great anime that they are missing out on."
Oreimo,2dgylj,tuffpupp,1 point,Thu Aug 14 03:35:30 2014 UTC,"Honestly the incest at the end was kind of a give away but everything leading up to it was great. I even somewhat enjoyed the ending because I felt it concluded their whole entire relationship. It did a great job of showing how they became distant and how they ""fixed"" it."
Oreimo,2dgylj,mathfreak123,4,Thu Aug 14 03:51:33 2014 UTC,"Just tell them that it's all 2D, and keeping 2D and 3D separate is as easy as Kirino says it is."
Oreimo,2dgylj,Txanim3,3,Thu Aug 14 01:47:39 2014 UTC,Well the incest doesn't really come into play until later on. So if they like it in the beginning they will probably not mind it and finish the show anyway.
Oreimo,2dgylj,pablomu,3,Wed Aug 13 22:52:31 2014 UTC,"I have a story about this, first I'm not an anime fan tho I watch things people recommend me, no matter if it's anime a movie or w/e still not going to watch game of thrones someone recommended me oreimo, I didn't ask anything after starting watching it another friend of mine who is a really big fan of anime told me it had the incest thing and that it was crap and told me the ending from wikipedia cause he didn't watch it, I gave no fucks and I watched oreimo, after ending it.  I told this anime fan and some other friends that we hang out together to watch it, that it was a really cool anime me saying that, impossible, they think I hate anime he said ""no, if you liked it, sure it's bad"", I recommended it him more times and he didn't want to watch (none of them), after some days they got intrest in things inside the anime cause I'm always talking about it, I even put videos or the songs of the anime while we are together they hate it when I do but later they say things like ""who is that character, is that girl his sister? etc etc, I tell them to watch it tho they still refuse to  I conclude that you can't make someone watch something they don't want no matter how much do you want them to do or how do you ask for it  this is so long, and I wrote it like a 5 years old kid, I'm fighting with dota 2 network while writing D:"

Oreimo,2dgylj,Chorizwing,1 point,Fri Aug 29 11:39:02 2014 UTC,"Well really up until the last 3 episodes I really didn't interpret there relationship as insest but rather as great siblings. I mean sure there were some hints here or there, but really if you stopped at episode 13 you would not have seen there relationship as wiered. This is one of my favret anime's because of the comedy, the frendships, and the very lovable characters. Sure it has some insest, but if you don't make it the main focus for watching you hardly notice."

Oreimo,2d5qby,Dirst,5,Sun Aug 10 17:17:56 2014 UTC,"The background characters are katakana, and they say ""doki"", which is a heartbeat sound (because she's nervous). Not entirely sure what ""kaaaaaaaa"" means. Kyousuke's basically saying ""y-yeah"". The bit coming out of Kirino in the last panel is ""pushaa"", which is probably a sound of some kind. I dunno. I tried."
Oreimo,2d5qby,White_sama,3,Sun Aug 10 20:12:25 2014 UTC,"Yeah,that's basically it, there's not exactly much conversation."
Oreimo,2d76ew,CosmicTransmutation,7,Mon Aug 11 02:42:54 2014 UTC,"Well, personally, I just absolutely loved the story. I loved it when Kuroneko and Kyousuke became a couple, and I loved the results in the last few episodes of the series as well. Regardless of whatever happened in last few episodes, I still loved all the characters and the story. These reasons might not end up being your reasons, and if you're watching Oreimo just to wish for your particular shipping, then you might not have any reason to continue watching; there's nothing really wrong with that though. It's not like the world will end if a large number of people don't follow stories to the end. I'm different, though. Anime, in general, caught my interest with stories, so I wanted to finish a story that grabbed my interest the whole time I watched/read.  Now, for some specifics about Oreimo's story that kept me going..... In the center stage, one of the driving forces of the entire story has always been Kirino and Kyousuke's relationship to each other. I had questions about how a sibling relationship could deteriorate into a cold war. One of the most memorable lines from season 1 during the Ayase conflict was, ""How could you only start acting like my brother after this whole time?"" I saw this as a clue that something happened in the past, and it was one of the things that kept me watching to find an answer.  The other thing is I really wanted was the siblings' relationship to each other to improve. The state of their relationship at the start of the series really bothered me; I think that's because I could sympathize with how a cold relationship feels like."
Oreimo,2d76ew,mathfreak123,1 point,Mon Aug 11 03:04:20 2014 UTC,"Don't get me wrong; I normally do finish what I start usually no matter what. But Episode 8 and 9 gave me such a bitter taste in my mouth I really don't understand the point of continuing.  I mean, it's less about shipping and more about the logistics of the story telling. The siblings relationship barely changes throughout the story. Or, it improves for an episode but goes back to square one because she's so damn rude. I was looking forward to them slowly getting closer over the series, instead of leapfrogging back and forth for 30 or so episodes.  shrug I don't know. I very well may continue just to see what happens, but its pretty obvious how its going to end. It sucks that the source material wasn't a game so I could at least play that and get the ending I want. ;_;"
Oreimo,2d76ew,mathfreak123,2,Mon Aug 11 03:25:29 2014 UTC,"I don't really emphasize finishing what you start in all cases; I just wanted to finish watching the story because I liked it.  Perhaps it's because I have read the light novels so I no longer see the anime in the same way anymore, or it's because it's been a while since I've last watched the anime, but I think the siblings' relationship is shown to improve over the episodes. Going on a fake date, telling each other about finding a girlfriend/boyfriend, helping each other after the girlfriend/boyfriend (especially with Kyousuke going to Kirino for life counseling) - these are things Kyousuke from season 1 would have never believed could have happened between him and Kirino.  In fact, judging by those events, by the end of S2 (but before the OVAs), Kyousuke and Kirino have grown closer to each other than many real world siblings!  I think I can sum this up with this: Kirino (and probably Kyousuke, too) is (are) a tsundere. You can not tell what her (their) relationship is with Kyousuke (to each other) based on the way she talks to him (the way they talk to each other)."

Oreimo,2czvcf,kamanashi,2,Sun Aug 10 15:50:49 2014 UTC,Last time I rewatched season 1 was right before season 2 aired. This is the first time I rewatched season 2 since it aired.

Oreimo,2czvcf,sagrado_corazon,8,Fri Aug 8 20:15:17 2014 UTC,He's a Ruri fan. He's probably still bitter about her losing to Kirino
Oreimo,2czvcf,KirinoMyWaifu,3,Sat Aug 9 01:10:02 2014 UTC,"It's not even the fact he's a Ruri fan, I couldn't care less. It's the fact he can't process the idea that someone else might prefer Kirino over Kuroneko. I don't see too many Kirino fans bashing Kuroneko."

The reaction was pretty much as you said, a lot of people were disappointed. I did hear a few complaints about it but for me... it ended as I expected, so I was not disappointed one bit. My girl was already shot down and it is in the title so... they knew it was coming...  At one point of the viewing I felt a lot of the energy of the room get released into tears (I don't think I have to say what part, you all know...).  But, in the end, it definitely was less exciting and energetic in the room. Partially because of the ending, but mostly because the room was clearing out because of the groups signing that was going on a bit after the viewing. The QA session wasn't that great because they didn't take questions from the group, they were prearranged."
Oreimo,2cz7ve,Kelzo_,1 point,Sat Aug 9 04:33:39 2014 UTC,"That's just sad :'(  Well, the ending pretty much left me hanging for hours and made me think for days.

But man I wish I had that experience with watching the last few episodes of Oreimo with fellow fans including the great staffs behind it. You'll be one of those few who could cherish it. Man, now I'm pretty jealous of you HAHAHAHA"

The preorder page for the game has been up on AmiAmi since yesterday. The OP link is to the PS3 version. The Vita version can be preordered here. It is expected to be released in November. The PS3 and Vita should be able to play physical games regardless of region, so it is import-friendly. Just expect a lot of Japanese text."

If supported, you could also use '俺の妹がこんなに可愛いわけがない', the Japanese title, instead of the Romanji. As for the banners and bases, as far as I'm aware there aren't any officially recognized logos for Oreimo, although Kirino is a pretty easy choice to use (She's what the story centers around), I imagine that using that both as a banner / base logo and a player might make it seem like your team is also centered around her.  Also, nice games number / level. How many hours do you have, to get to that point?"

Oreimo,2cuyiu,skyshroud6,2,Thu Aug 7 14:53:15 2014 UTC,"Golden Time was pretty good, same original author that did Toradora, same studio that did the anime, and as far as I know, same director (don't quote me on that last part though).  Kokoro connect was also really good, the main series is only 13 episodes, but there's the micchi random ova's that finish the series off.  Ano Natsu De Mattaru is also really good, get's a bit drama-y at the end however.  Depending on how you look at it, the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya can be considered a rom-com (there are different orders you can watch it in, and each one changes the flow of the story)  The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behaviour recently aired. It's a fun show.  Both the Familiar of Zero and Shakugan no Shana are similar, good rom-coms with a bit of action.  I enjoyed the Hentai Prince and the Stony faced cat, although I've read mixed reviews on it. I think it had a feel like if Kyoto Animation made Orieimo.   I also enjoyed recently my sister is unusual. It's and ecchi with not much depth, but for what it is it was pretty fun.   Acchi Kochi is really good (gonna be lynched for saying this but) it's like Lucky Star if Lucky Star were actually funny.  Nyarko San is also pretty funny. Think creatures of the lovecraft universe personified as highschool girls, however it's more on the comedy side than it is romance, but it has it's moments.  There's also Midori Days. What happens if you wake up and your hand has been replaced by a girl. It's an older one, and it kind of shows, but still good.  Not sure if Heavens Lost Property counts, more of a straight up comedy with romantic elements, then it is a rom-com, but figured I'd mention it.  At some point you have to watch Chobits. Another older one, made back in 2001 I think, but it's really really good.  My Bride is a Mermaid is pretty good. Guy almost drowns and is saved my a mermaid, and due to circumstances is forced to marry her.   B Gata H Kei, Yamada's First Time is also pretty good. Girl tries to loose her virginity, picks a guy that she thinks will be easy, and winds up falling for him along the way. Pretty NSFW though, especially near the end.   Edit: Forgot to read you're MAL, looks like you have a few of these, still recommend the ones you don't though."

Oreimo,2crewu,Xenanthropy,4,Wed Aug 6 05:21:15 2014 UTC,"A list of everything that ever exists might be too long for the opening post. You can probably find everything that officially exists when you search for the show on MyFigureCollection.  Merchandise usually comes in four flavors. There is Japan-marketed official merchandise, which is most of the merchandise you see for anime and most of which you will have to import. There is also unofficial fan merchandise, which includes things like fan doujins and doujin-circle dakimakura covers. Then you have Western-marketed merchandise, things usually made by GE Animation and other western licensees (which tend to be cheaper and poorer quality). Then lastly, are bootleg items, which include knockoffs and ""custom"" items.  Amazon is unfortunately full of the last category of items, such as the phone cases listed, as well as wall scrolls (although some are official Western merchandise, usually indicated by official company logos; bootlegs steal artwork and reprint it without consent). Along with that, I would always be wary about the seller, as if it is sold by a third-party, there is a chance that the figure could be a bootleg.  As always, when it comes to merchandise, I recommend /a/'s guide."
Oreimo,2crewu,Histy,3,Wed Aug 6 09:51:21 2014 UTC,"You make some good points. I just thought I'd try to make a thread with a big handful of items to pick from. I guess it just depends what sites you order them from. I know most of the stuff from amiami is good as far as imported, but I ran out of room before I could start on that website :("
Oreimo,2crewu,Histy,3,Wed Aug 6 10:58:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah and a lot of products are probably sold out on AmiAmi as well. Some items only get one print run and then the used market or expensive third-parties are the only way to get them.  For a popular show like Oreimo, there is way too much out there for just one thread. You might want to consider making themed threads, such as for a particular type of media or a particular character, so it would be easier to list everything. Or maybe instead of listing all the items, you could make a listing of the most interesting items, if there are too many.  But those are just what I would suggest, it is totally up to you in the end! The subreddit can always use more content."
Oreimo,2crewu,Pl1xpl0x,1 point,Wed Aug 6 11:02:39 2014 UTC,"Well tbh there isn't much left on amazon :P I was kinda going for more of quantity than quality,but I tried to stay away from products with bad reviews.

Oreimo,2cm85n,Wolfeang,3,Mon Aug 4 19:41:40 2014 UTC,"Hmm... there are only a few episodes where Mikagami appears in. Notably, the second Comiket episode, the fake-boyfriend episode, the give-advice-to-Kyousuke-about-touching-breasts episode, and the last episode.  Judging by your comment about shooting the messenger, which implies that Mikagami was around to send a message or assist with some topic, that narrows down my guess of which episode you're talking about to either the fake boyfriend episode or the one talking about breasts. The advice about breasts isn't really that relevant to the overall story, so I'm guessing you're talking about episode 6, the fake boyfriend episode.  By the end of episode 6, I couldn't hate Mikagami. The only weird thing about him is that he somehow knows (or at least has a very good intuition) about the subtleties in Kirino's and Kyousuke's relationship to each other. His purpose in the plot was to drive Kyousuke's feelings forward and to be open about them with Kirino. Interestingly, Kuroneko's short relationship with Kyousuke led to Kirino driving her feelings out as well, which was one of Kuroneko's goals to achieve her ideal world (Kuroneko would not be happy with just a relationship with Kyousuke if her closest friend Kirino had to hide and endure her feelings).  I can not hate Mikagami for the same reason I can not hate Kuroneko: they both have a similar motive to help the Kousaka siblings be happier. It's one reason why I absolutely adore nearly all the characters in this series."
Oreimo,2cm85n,mathfreak123,1 point,Tue Aug 5 02:53:09 2014 UTC,"However, there's one important difference. Kuroneko is a cute girl who has feelings for Kyousuke anyway, and denies herself, whereas Mikagami just comes out of no where and looks sexually ambiguous"

Oreimo,2cm338,Histy,3,Mon Aug 4 22:57:22 2014 UTC,"I would also include the tsundere attitude, as well as the working hard to impress someone close to them (especially in sports [kendo/track & field], where they both excel; they are also studious and well-respected amongst their peers). There is also escapism into video games on both of their ends to combat their initial feelings that were muddled due to traumatic events (SAO Incident/Manami).  They do both end up supporting their brothers in their respective romances (Asuna/Kuroneko). But that subplot is where their similarities end and their lives veer in different directions. I honestly wouldn't put Suguha's love for Kazuto on the same level as Kirino's love for Kyousuke; because both situations differ on both sides of the relationship."
Oreimo,2cm338,Kelzo_,1 point,Wed Aug 6 04:24:05 2014 UTC,"At least Kirito and Suguha can end up with each other with no such issues, as for Oreimo, we were just left with such implications"

Oreimo,2ckig2,Kelzo_,2,Mon Aug 4 13:23:12 2014 UTC,Yah it looks like its an unreleased ost sadly
Oreimo,2ckig2,mathfreak123,1 point,Mon Aug 4 15:32:56 2014 UTC,"I heard recently that it might be released together with a Blu-Ray set, but if we're super lucky, we'll get it as a second OST. I did a quick count of some pieces from the first few episodes, and I think I can count at least 12 new pieces in S2 so there might be enough for a decent chance of getting a second OST."
Oreimo,2ckig2,mathfreak123,1 point,Wed Aug 6 04:53:45 2014 UTC,please let this be true
Oreimo,2chzfd,Kelzo_,3,Sun Aug 3 13:01:19 2014 UTC,"I believe everything is in here. However, they have no subs. I've been trying to find everything with subs too, but no chance."
Oreimo,2chzfd,Sharinflan,1 point,Sun Aug 3 15:20:24 2014 UTC,Thanks dude. I'm really wondering why won't any fansub group want to do the extras in S2 as oreimo has some big fan base out in the internet.  I hope this torrent would get a subbed ver. and some additional BD + DVD scans would be really great.
Oreimo,2chzfd,Sharinflan,2,Sun Aug 3 17:02:06 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's a shame.  The best thing I can do for you is giving you this, I guess."
Oreimo,2chzfd,Sharinflan,1 point,Sun Aug 3 18:45:36 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the link dude, I guess we'll just have to wait for some sub group to do some of the extras.   Wait, is After Story already released? or is it still till 2015?"
Oreimo,2chzfd,Sharinflan,2,Sun Aug 3 23:37:38 2014 UTC,"It's in 2015. It was an announcement in the recently released artbook Hiro Kanzaki Artwork Collections Cute (that I need to download right now because you remembered me of it!).  EDIT: found the small After Story along with the interview with Kanzaki Hiro. The japanese version (scans) is on mediafire, and the translated version is on Baka Tsuki."
Oreimo,2chzfd,Acyy,1 point,Tue Aug 5 20:04:34 2014 UTC,"Thanks dude, the articles from major sites seems to be a bit confusing. I do really hope that it would come out on Q2 as I'm planning on re watching oreimo next year before reading the LN.  Is the interview already translated?"
Oreimo,2chzfd,Acyy,2,Wed Aug 6 12:35:22 2014 UTC,Don't think so. At least I couldn't find it.
Oreimo,2chzfd,Pl1xpl0x,2,Wed Aug 6 19:17:46 2014 UTC,I know its confusing to me too. They say After Story 2015 but that small story that came with the art book is also referred to as after story so could it be that what came with the art book is a tease to an actual after story or is it mistranslated and 2015 is meant for a 2nd art book? I keep hope that we'll get an actual after story as no one has denied or confirmed either.
Oreimo,2chlpw,Xenanthropy,3,Sun Aug 3 08:11:29 2014 UTC,"I feel the post-anime sadness for a lot of series, but it's particularly strong for me when it comes to Oreimo. It was enough to actually get me reading the light novels and the extra stories - something I have never done before.  I have the feeling that what you're feeling is pretty normal."
Oreimo,2chlpw,mathfreak123,2,Sun Aug 3 08:15:27 2014 UTC,I couldn't stop thinking about Oreimo for 2 weeks (and I often still think about it xD)
Oreimo,2chlpw,Hawkki,1 point,Sun Aug 3 14:17:31 2014 UTC,"Ok, good! I haven't felt this way since I finished The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (My favorite anime, although Oreimo might take its place). Even then, I haven't read the light novels for it, or even looked up merchandise for it. As soon as I finished Oreimo though, I just really wanted to surround myself with merchandise, read the novels, the whole thing. I'm not sure what it is about the anime. I got so drawn into it."
Oreimo,2chlpw,Woowoo_Water,1 point,Sun Aug 3 08:38:05 2014 UTC,"Post-oreimo sadness kicked me into starting other light novels and rom com animes. I gotta thank Oreimo for throwing me into manga, anime and LNs.  For a more exact story, I was so depressed at the ending I watched Yosuga no Sora and Kiss x Sis to fulfill the incestual void. And afterwards started on Toradora, Sakurasoe, Henneko, Oregairu, Nisekoi etc because I'm still searching for that satisfying ending to fill that void Oreimo left on me. I don't know what, but it's still there."

This is how you buy happiness with money.""  Works 120% of the times.  On the serious side note - pretty normal feeling I would say. If you love something, then you want more of it. It's a natural feeling. Just restrain yourself enough so you don't go over the line and you will be fine."

Oreimo,2chlpw,bigfatround0,1 point,Mon Aug 4 07:19:04 2014 UTC,"Nope, I belie  the distribution is like Weiss schwarz... Certain number of signs in the carton(let's say 16 boxes per carton) and there will be X signed cards...let's go with one of each so according to yuyutei, there are 3 signs... So maybe it's like 3 signs out of 16 boxes.   I bought 3 boxes from amazon after I got my first signed, out of those 3 I pulled my second kuroneko. The other two didn't have any signs."
Oreimo,2chlpw,bigfatround0,1 point,Mon Aug 4 07:25:30 2014 UTC,"Ok, so its basically random to an extent. Well lets hope I get a signed one from one box XD 34 per box can get pretty pricey. I wish they had some oreimo ringed binders so I could display the cards somehow, all they had on amazon were folders. Guess I can just get ringed binders and print off oreimo stuff and slip it in the covers."

Oreimo,2cf46l,Basher400,3,Sat Aug 2 12:48:05 2014 UTC,Why would they leave it like that in anime. It'll look more like a plot hole.  thanks anyways
Oreimo,2cf46l,-Niernen,3,Sat Aug 2 12:51:41 2014 UTC,Why would they leave it like that in anime.    Ran out of time. They cut out about 3 volumes worth of content so they can reach the end in two seasons.
Oreimo,2cf46l,arandomaltaccount,6,Sat Aug 2 20:11:31 2014 UTC,"The worst part about it is that they cut out the most powerful reason for Ayase to like Kyousuke. It feels like they did it just so that Ayase would have a much weaker case in teh battle for Kyousuke, and it let them cut her confession short too...  This is arguably the most serious problem faced in the series by any of the four main girls, as it is a stalker following a middle-school girl around. Kyousuke comes through and deals with it for her, even in the runup to his exam. Sure, she's a twelve-year-old, but the potential is still there.  Kyousuke saves Ayase several times, and in typically substantial ways from this to scapegoating himself to save her friendships. Contrast any of the other girls, where they fall for Kyousuke by just being in his presence. While I can accept that Kirino won, since she probably has the second-best reason, I am still a firm believer that Ayase should have won."
Oreimo,2cf46l,tanzorbarbarian,3,Sun Aug 3 03:33:53 2014 UTC,"Ma nigga  For real though, I haven't even read the LNs but I still prefer Ayase to Kirino. Kirino may be ""best"" girl, but Ayase will always be BEST in my mind."

Oreimo,2c7im6,DFisBUSY,8,Thu Jul 31 03:46:45 2014 UTC,The author wasn't able to do the full incest ending he intended. So all we get are some very subtle indications. Also a common theme through the story is the narrator not telling us the full truth.
Oreimo,2c7im6,lynxman89,1 point,Thu Jul 31 08:18:39 2014 UTC,ah i see. i had a feeling a full incest ending wouldn't go over well with some higher ups in that industry.  on a side note; i started watching some of the oreimo psp routes. not sure how i feel about these.
Oreimo,2c7im6,studwalker,4,Thu Jul 31 16:42:31 2014 UTC,I know. The ones that don't end with Kirino are ridiculous.
Oreimo,2c7im6,sirbob6,7,Thu Jul 31 22:52:54 2014 UTC,"The 10 years later story has to do with one of the VN endings, not the actual series.   Read this as the epilogue. It basically implies that Kyousuke still in a relationship with Kirino and that Kirino is evidently telling Ruri about the lewd things that they do together."
Oreimo,2c7im6,mathfreak123,3,Fri Aug 1 05:20:52 2014 UTC,"Oh shit, it really implies that? Why do I suck so much at reading comprehension? D: I didn't catch anything when I read it."

Fufun--- both are important, right?”  “......I'm completely convinced by what you said just now. Why, if you lost that beautiful face of yours, the only thing remaining would be that bitch heart of yours, after all”  “What part of me are you calling a bitch!? Just what are you saying to this super pure otome Kiririn standing in front of you!”  “...... pure?”  Kuroneko tilts her neck in doubt. And then, mutters with a scary low voice.  “All the women who dare to brag about their love life before me are bitches, all right?”  “Wait! I haven't be, be, be, be, been bragging at all, you hear!”  “Yes, you have. Why, specifically speaking, that Sunday last week----”  “Da~! Sto~p! You can't talk about that! You definitely ca~n't!”  Kirino covers up Kuroneko's mouth, panicking.  Mmph, Mmph, Kuroneko's distressed voice escapes out, as her face grows redder and redder.  Saori appearing to be very nervous said,  “Ki, Kiririn-shi! If you cover her mouth li, like this, she won't be able breathe de gozaru! Are you intending on strangling Kuroneko-shi down!?”  “Bu, bu, bu, bu, but Kuroneko's going to......!”  And right there, suddenly, Kirino with her face completely red, glares at me, and shouts out in a really loud voice.  “I haven't been bragging at all, okay!”  …...I get it already, just stop making a scene in the bookstore, all right."

Shame, because they're some of my favourite songs in the OST.   They still have to release the entire series on Blu-Ray as a boxset, so maybe then we'll see them released on an OST. Hopefully."
Oreimo,2c0sil,KirinoMyWaifu,2,Tue Jul 29 17:26:58 2014 UTC,"The only reason I can see that they wouldn't release them would be that there are only a few pieces left that haven't been released (I think). While scanning through S2, I don't think I could pick out more than 10 unreleased tracks (hopefully, I'm just bad at recognizing music, and there's actually a whole slew of music that hasn't been put on a CD yet).  Although, I'm not an anime industry expert, so I'm not sure if having ~10 unreleased tracks as an OST would be plenty enough or not, although it pales in comparison to the current OST, which has ~30 pieces."
Oreimo,2c0sil,KirinoMyWaifu,2,Wed Jul 30 02:44:12 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think they would release those OST separately, like they did for S1, but I have a bit of hope that they might bundle them with the complete Blu Ray set ( if that comes out). After all, they bundled cd's with the Blu Ray volumes for S2, and they only had 2 songs each."

Oreimo,2bs0hn,BlackOptimist,1 point,Sat Jul 26 15:36:50 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I've been working on my writing skills.  I understand why people hate her, but it seems most people do not understand her. She definitely did terrible things. You are not given many reasons to like her, just no reasons to dislike her until the very end. I do not like her very much either. I guess the nicest thing I could say about her is that she had Kyousuke's best interest at heart. I would like to believe that she did such evil things to protect Kyousuke and Kirino. It makes her evil make sense.   If she were just a mean person, she'd blow up more often. But she's always so well composed and never yells. That means either she is a sociopath, or she knows for a fact that what she's doing is right, and what's right will win out in the end. She does not seem like a sociopath, so she must believe she's right."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Adept94,4,Sat Jul 26 15:59:24 2014 UTC,"Welcome to the Oreimo community.   A place where ""...a shit"" is completely more valid as an argument then several scenes from canon and where the ""perfect husband""-theorie is not even mentioned ones in the whole story, but is generally accepted, even though it's only interpretation of one scene, with disregarding many others.  You want to talk about Manami? Fine. This Fandom will pump so much hatred into you, it's not even funny anymore.  I have to say it here, she isn't a good ""waifu"". She is normal, plain and when compared with the other girls she starts to become invisible.  However the hatred she gets, it's clearly undeserved. Because the things you figured out already are right for the most part. The necessary evil part is also right, even though she does it not only for the sake of protecting Kyousuke, but also for Kirino. Which can be proofed by the way she interacts with the two siblings in the no-incest-route of the second PSP-game, presented on english by Ziddy on YT.  That she ""destroyed"" epic-Kyousuke had its reasons. Kyousuke is helping everyone. And especially his younger version was demanding to be praised for doing this things and was bragging with it like some kind of hero. The Sakurai-Accident must have been horrible for him, because the person he wanted to help got hurt because of him. He wasn't the hero at that moment- for his whole class he was the enemy, the one which destroyed the camping-trip and hurted little Sakurai. MANAMI steps in at that moment. Something which isn't acknowledged by the fandom by the way.   So, at the time he breaks down completely, Manami encourages him to become normal. Something which was already mentioned at the beginning of VN 11: Here, Kyousuke wants to be praised for sneaking out to school in the mid of night, to find out who was causing trouble there. It could have been someone dangerous. Kyousuke could have get hurt or worse. As a friend, I also wouldn't be happy if my friend would do something so reckless, something which could endanger him.   Manami is honestly concerned about him being in danger- the community condemns her for being a good friend.   Also the perfect husband theorie is rubbish- she loved him before he changed, and maybe she was even the first girl to do so. She just hated the thought of him getting hurt."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,nikidash,1 point,Sun Jul 27 15:17:59 2014 UTC,"Most people have actually been very civil in their disagreement and conversation of Manami. It's been really interesting conversing with people and finding out why people have Manami, and even why people like Manami. Overall, I agree with just about everything you said, and all of it is why I think she is kind, generous, evil, and my favorite character of the show. I can understand why people might dislike her, but I do not think people should hate her. You raise several good points, and I agree with all of them. She is a very caring, very nice, and very calculating person. She does what she does to ensure that everyone ends up safe. She can clearly see the results of what she did, and how terribly it affected Kyousuke's relationships with his family and friends, but she knew it was for the best. She could not step down or turn back, because there's no telling what could happen then. She needed to make sure he ended up safe. I respect her for having so much responsibility for what she did, and seeing it through to the end."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Marubal,6,Sun Jul 27 15:36:40 2014 UTC,"The problem is, there's a limit on how much evil can be justified by the intentions. Yes, she did have good intentions, i'll give her that. But then what? Scarring Kirino when she still was a kid, destroying what she most loved, dragging Kyosuke down from a life of excellence, causing a cold war between the two for years? I'm not passing over this.  Plus, what she did at the end. That punch to Kirino telling how she wanted to do this for years, plus the whole fight? The intentions might be good (kinda, because the real reason for doing all that was not because she was worried about what society would think of them, she wanted to remove Kirino and have Kyosuke all for herself).  Tl;dr manami a shit"
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Hawkki,1 point,Sat Jul 26 17:16:31 2014 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing with you on most points, her intentions do not excuse her actions. What she did was terrible. No one has completely selfless intentions, she obviously liked Kyousuke. Any chance she'd have to get Kyousuke for herself, she'd take. Cannot really fault her for that. The mental anguish, the fight, the results of her efforts. They are all proof that she is terrible. The last thing that I am arguing is that Kyousuke should have ended up with her, or that she is the hero of the show. She is evil. She is the paragon of villains: doing evil because evil needs to be done. It did not need to be done, of course, but, from her perspective, she need to do something. Anything. Whatever needed to be done, she felt she needed to do to save Kyousuke."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,mathfreak123,4,Sat Jul 26 17:33:50 2014 UTC,"I don't hate Manami for preaching incest is bad, I hate her for how she influenced Kyousuke's personality just so she could have her ideal man.  Compare Manami helping Kyousuke through his depression over the accident with Sakurai with how Kirino helped him when he was down from being dumped by Kuroneko. Manami's advice turned him into a lazy slob with no aspirations, strained his relationship with his family and dodged him away from the actual solution to his problem, which would be tracking down Sakurai so he could apologize to her. Thanks to that, she could monopolize him.  Kirino did exactly what Manami failed to do, she encouraged him to stand firm, put her personal feelings aside to help him find Kuroneko and set the record straight and effectively helped solve the issue at the source. Not only that, she also helped him find Sakurai later on.  When the parallel is drawn, there's no way I can see Manami in a positive light. If Kyousuke had gone to Manami for comfort on the Kuroneko issue instead of Kirino, I'm afraid things would have ended up even worse."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,mathfreak123,2,Sat Jul 26 14:43:58 2014 UTC,That is one of the reasons I hate her too.
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Marubal,1 point,Sat Jul 26 15:42:16 2014 UTC,"No, no, there is definitely very little positive light to see Manami in. I agree, she's terrible. But overall, she does what she thinks is right. I have not read the LN, so I may be missing some crucial details of her character, but from what I know, she's overall a kind person. She makes mistakes, huge mistakes, that make her essentially evil, but she still wants what's best."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,ninedeedae,2,Sat Jul 26 15:00:12 2014 UTC,"I recently finished reading the LNs. I would think that the Sakurai incident is pretty crucial, so I'd recommend reading at least that part of the story."

Oreimo,2bs0hn,TrustMeIGotHaki,1 point,Sat Jul 26 19:36:26 2014 UTC,"but she still wants what's best.   From her point of view. She thinks Kyousuke staying as the average Joe with no spice in his life was the best for him all the way to the end of the story. In contrast to that, Kirino learned to accept that her brother is not the invincible superhero she used to put on a pedestal back in her childhood and started loving him for who he is.  Seriously, just read the 11th volume of the LN. It will give you a lot of insight on how twisted Manami's character really is."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,TrustMeIGotHaki,2,Sat Jul 26 18:14:08 2014 UTC,"From her point of view.   Exactly. She thinks what she's doing is right. It's obvious that she's wrong. What she did was just terrible, any way you look at it. She is evil. I am not arguing that she was right, or that Kyousuke should have chosen her. I'm just trying to get people to understand her motives.  Also, I do plan on reading the LN. I'm sure it will fill in crucial details I may be missing right now."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Pl1xpl0x,2,Sat Jul 26 18:36:49 2014 UTC,"Sorry this is really naive. For a lot of reasons the issue is a lot more complicated than you make it out to be. If you think what she did was evil then you're basically saying everyone is evil. One of the reasons for this was she was a child when she told Kyousuke and her sister the things she did. Also, even if you count what she did later on in the series, near the end, you can't possibly reduce her to being an evil person even then. It's not about what SHE did, her actions are more a reflection of society and its norms; Manami is just an extension of society, as we all are--everyone places various pressures on people, and those pressures arise on things that we earnestly believe is right, even though in many cases our general rules about things can't realistically apply for every single person. But even now we haven't addressed the fact that in this issue you can't just pick a right or wrong answer.  No given rule is the best possible way to deal with all circumstances. One of the things you can draw from this story is that it was an illustration of a case which highlighted one of the POSSIBLE exceptions to the norms of society. This was basically explained in the very last episode when Kyousuke was talking about how what they were doing was both right and wrong--the social implications that it had for their parents, for instance, would be a reason it is wrong. To neglect these issues and to just dive into the relationship without even acknowledging them is beyond selfishness. It's selfish for Kyousuke and his sister to have a romantic relationship because it hurts people outside of their circle of two. That isn't the same as saying they shouldn't engage in the relationship though. There isn't any clear right answer to this. The issue is more complicated than that.   What Manami said and did shouldn't be held against her just because you felt that the two should have ended up together, and therefore the obstacles she presented to them were somehow outrageously immoral such that it constitutes ""evil"". One of the reasons why this show is so good is because it doesn't paint black and white pictures like that--the author acknowledges the repercussions to the possible relationship by stating the affect it might have on their parents, as an example, and as already mentioned. No challenging moral decision can be straight up answered in a clear way--that's the point. Sometimes life doesn't present any clear path to take, and to earnestly believe that the path you did take in such cases was right is both naive and ignorant. Both sides to any issue worth thinking about has valid points on both sides."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Pl1xpl0x,1 point,Wed Oct 22 04:33:08 2014 UTC,"You are narrowing this to the incest part of this show to such an extent that you're practi painting Manami to be good. I'm not saying Manami is evil because she thinks incest is bad, I didn't want Kyousuke to end up with Kirino, this is all around bigger than the incest side of it. Manami slowly made Kyousuke more and more dependent on her, made him less outgoing, less athletic, his grades started to slip, he got lazier, etc. Kirino was finally starting to catch up to Kyousuke in those regards, and, from her POV, Manami just took it all away from her.   She ran to Manami's house to try to get her to stop it, but she wouldn't. She thinks that this is the only way for Kyousuke to be hers. So she poisons the mind of a child, saying that what she wants is wrong, thinking that, at that time, what Kirino wants is to marry Kyousuke, which it's not, and actually causes Kirino to fall in love with Kyousuke. It's not her moral objection to incest that makes her evil, it's how she went about it."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Axxl1,2,Wed Oct 22 14:09:20 2014 UTC,"""You are narrowing this to the incest part of this show to such an extent that you're practi painting Manami to be good."" I'll indulge this unusual starter by asking you: How specifically did I do this? In fact, no where did I make any positive claim on any such goodness of Manami, I was simply pointing out that your claim for her being ""evil"" is quite strange.  There are two points I'll make to your latest response. The first is that isn't clear whether or not Manami made Kyousuke more lazy, have less grades etc, as you say. On the one hand, this is Kirino's interpretation of how things happened formed as such when she was a child, not something that can be counted on objectively; on the other hand, regarding the point that ""this made Kyousuke more and more dependent on her""--(uh, did it?) that is a claim I buy even less. Manami in fact ENCOURAGES independence from her, which is just the opposite. This is clearly demonstrated when she encourages him to pursue Kuroneko, without expressing any kind of jealousy, judgment, or possessiveness. She is shown to be entirely supportive of him in all of his endeavors, it's ONLY when it comes to the kind of love he shares with his sister that she draws the line and becomes a source of judgment (a kind of judgment which I wrote about in my earlier post as completely understandable given the practical necessities of living in a society, which again, I clarify, amounts in no way to a positive claim of goodness or badness, but is merely a practical concern of which, as members of society, we're all bound and should all consider, short of becoming, for instance, one of those isolated crazy persons who completely live out their own realities without concerning themselves with the thoughts of others to the slightest degree).  I think you're just trying to twist the details of the show in order to support a claim I don't think you thought too much about, but which you're latching onto because you think it seems interesting, and of which you received some minor support. However, closer analysis of the show, clearly reveals better explanations, none of which suggest Manami is evil.   At the same time you're overlooking other details of the show (one of which I just pointed out) which completely discredit the idea you are getting hung up over. This brings me to my second point. That if anyone were to take your analysis seriously, this would be tantamount to placing a severely strict weight of judgment upon a 5 or 6 year old girl (Manami at the time), the age of which--as you say--was the moment Manami ""poisons the mind of a child, saying that what she wants is wrong"". One might reply to this and say ""oh but this is just a show, a fantasy; we can't judge a 5 year old girl in a TV show by the same standards of which we'd judge a 5 year old in real life"". The foolishness of such a response is clear when we recognize that unless we want any discussion about such shows to degenerate into meaninglessness where people discussing them can't get clear on what it is they are really discussing (degenerating into arbitrary rule after arbitrary rule, making any kind of fruitless discussion impossible) that we should discuss characters on shows in a similar way as we would talk about people in real life, and judge them by comparable standards. In real life, a five year old girl who tells a younger girl that her dreams of marrying her brother is bad, while, sure, you COULD argue is insensitive, blunt--and whatever else adjective you'd like to add--isn't actually the personification of evil. The same is true for the character of Manami. It's actually really humorous that you're suggesting otherwise, and I hope you can see that and laugh about it."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,DinTwo,2,Sun Nov 16 01:16:41 2014 UTC,Actually Manami is my second favorite girl lol
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Adept94,2,Sat Jul 26 17:22:48 2014 UTC,That's actually pretty interesting. May I ask what your reasoning for that is?
Oreimo,2bs0hn,DinTwo,2,Sat Jul 26 17:34:46 2014 UTC,"Sure, I'll respond later when I get back from work dude"
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Pl1xpl0x,2,Sat Jul 26 17:46:02 2014 UTC,Cool
Oreimo,2bs0hn,DinTwo,2,Sat Jul 26 17:48:38 2014 UTC,"Basically, I like Manami because she is very caring and helpful, some say she's evil but I really don't get why.   I would consider her an unintentional, tragic, anti-hero.   She was pretty harsh in telling Kirino that her feelings for her brother were weird, yet she did it because she loved Kyousuke, not to hurt Kirino.   Unfortunately by doing this she started a big bad ""cold war"" because Kirino couldn't take criticism, though I do partially understan  I don't consider her acts evil at all, she just didn't want to lose her love to his sister.  Yes it was her fault that Kirino ever became seriously romantically interested in Kyousuke, but it wasn't her intention.  Also if we want to talk about manipulation, how about that one part where Kirino pretended to date the gay guy, her goal was to make Kyousuke jealous or something, honestly, I can't fully remember, I was more focused on Kuroneko in that story arc lol  Manami's actions were not fully justified the first time she told Kirino that incest was weird, but in my opinion, her final scene was 100% justified.  At that point, Kirino and Kyousuke's romance was ""official"" and they were about to get ""married"". In my opinion their relationship was some of the most childish shit ever. (see: ""Incest FTW"" -Kyousuke)  Manami may or may not have realized she had started the whole mess in the first place, but she knew it had to be stopped, she tried her hardest (See: Manami emotionally naked, begging Kyousuke to rethink his shit) but to no avail.  Manami's final scene was one of the saddest scenes in the whole show, it was almost as sad as the Summoning of Yamineko scene.   I lost my train of thought, but to conclude, I view Oreimo as a tragedy, not as a romance, comedy, or drama.   Manami is a tragic anti hero of sorts, and is largely misunderstood.   I'll add more responses if I think of anything I forgot to cover."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Pl1xpl0x,2,Sun Jul 27 01:58:55 2014 UTC,"That's actually really interesting. The same reasons I view her as an evil, pitiable, paragon of villainy, you see her as a tragic anti-hero. I fully understand that she did not mean to cause any of what she caused, but I still that what she did was evil. Not intentionally evil, but still evil. She could not have known that what she told Kirino would cause such mental and emotional suffering in her, but that does not make Manami any less responsible for it.  Kirino is definitely not completely clean in this either. Far from it. She manipulates him time and again to her will. As does Ayase, and even Kanako for a short while. But their cases did not have as huge and far reaching consequences as Manami's. She definitely went overboard the first time she spoke to Kirino about it, but did seem pretty justified in her final scene. I do not know about fully justified, but I cannot disagree with what she did or why she did it. She is definitely tragic, and widely misunderstood.  I do not think anti-hero fits her though. She seems to me to be, what I think is, the most interesting type of villain, the type that is trying to be the hero, trying to save the one she loves so bad, that she does not realize she ever became a villain. Imagine if Anakin Skywalker had done everything he did, but never actually gave in to the dark side. He kept doing what, to us, is obviously evil, but the whole time, thought he was only doing what was right. That, to me, is what makes her so extraordinary. She's a villain, but views herself as the hero. It left me surprised."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Adept94,2,Sun Jul 27 03:54:42 2014 UTC,"I have mixed feelings about her. Initially I would say, I hate Manami, but after thinking about it, its not hate.   The thing that bothers me the most, is how she continued to act after she actually brought (not the right word, but the correct one won't come to my mind atm, tore is too harsh if you know what I mean)  Kyuoske and Kirino apart. Back then, she was a smart girl and maybe to an extend knew what her influence on Kyosuke would do to him (The ""bringing apart"" how I called it). I give her the benefit of the doubt and say that her intentions were quiet simple at that age and she did not think of all that could follow, of how she actually changes his whole life by, in the end, making him lazy.   But later, she continued down the road she once took and here is where I start to blame her. When Kirino and Kyosuke started getting closer again, she pretended that she wanted to solve the problems she and Kirino had, but really all she wanted was to keep them at a distance from each other. I'm not sure about her ulterior motive, either maybe wanting to claim Kyosuke for herself or just stopping any potential incest that may occur (Here again the question, stop that because of the social consequences or something else..?).   She should have seen what she actually did to Kyosuke and realized that there must be a way for her to 1.) maybe get together with Kyosuke while 2.) him having a healthy (not incestious) relatioship to Kirino (you can not really call what happened after the Sakurai incident [I have not read the Manga or LN, but plan on doing it, what I say here is merely based on what I've read about it on this sub basically] a good/healthy relationship) and 3.) him having a successful life with dreams and goals to achieve, not limited by him wanting to be ""average, normal"". I really believe that nobody should have the goal of being normal, not outstanding. You should not have to be different from what/who you really are just to be normal. I mean, sure, if his true self was a his-sister-loving person, that is not something that I would really encourage / support, but if that is really the way he is, I would (propably) not try to change him all too much. I myself have started being more myself a while ago and .. I'm just so much more happy :-D  Uuh, I hate it when I write walls of text, I always forget what I wanted to say. But to actually come to your point of understanding and pitying her: I think I understand her, and I really get why you think that she should be pityied ( / pitied .....ok, idk if that is spelled correctly, my brain is boiling, correct me if I'm wrong please) but I still say that she could have done so many things differently, better, that, while I don't really hate her, I can not pity her for what she has done / how she ended up and how Kyosuke acted in the last episode. I believe that while in the beginning her motives were (from her perspective) mostly good, in the end there was too much jealousy involved from Manami to go and repair what she had destroyed. The once good relationship between Kirino and Kyosuke. Oh, also I would say that at such a young age, Manami barely knew anything about love herself and Kirino's feelings for Kyosuke. From what I've gathered, Kirino adored Kyosuke, always following him, looked up to him as just perfect.   How could Manami know at the age of a elementaryschooler know that Kirino loved Kyosuke in more than a sibling kind of way? Somebody here in the thread said something similar already, so I'll just repeat it shortly: If Kyosuke and Kirino really would have been good siblings, would have Kirino really started to love Kyosuke in a romantic, non-sibling kind of way? Or did the love stem from the artificial distance created by Manami and the hole that was left in Kirino's heart that really started her longing for her brother?   It was Manami's choice and action that destroyed a close relationship and do nothing to repair it in a healthy way. I understand her, but can not pity her because of her continuation of the road she took as a little girl.   Wow, that was long and propably repetetive, I'm sorry :-D"
Oreimo,2bs0hn,DinTwo,1 point,Sat Jul 26 18:49:00 2014 UTC,"I see where you're coming from. It's an interesting viewpoint, and would be interested in knowing more. From what I can gather, though, it seems your do not pity her mainly because she failed to recognize the error of her ways and try to fix her relationship with Kirino. It may be that she thought herself in too deep to change her ways at that point, though that seems unlikely based on her demeanor. I do not have an answer to that part of it. I'll have to look into the LN side of it later, though.  She absolutely could have done things different, and most options would have been better. There was a lot of jealousy at the end, and I do not think she expected to be able to repair her relationship with Kirino. She just wanted Kyousuke to see how wrong it was. Also, I believe that Kirino probably would not have fallen in love with Kyousuke if Manami had not gotten involved. She was practicing her speed to show up Kyousuke, which would have caused Kyousuke to step up his game, ending with them both 1-upping each other through lots of self improvement. She would have gotten the approval she wanted from Kyousuke, while continuing to improve herself. I believe that everything she did was wrong, but for the right reasons. I pity her because she just wanted everything to be ok, but in doing so, she ruined any potential at a relationship she would have had with him, and in fact caused the incest that she was trying to prevent. I feel bad for her, because she was her own undoing."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Hawkki,2,Sat Jul 26 20:11:53 2014 UTC,"Ah, okay, with your explanation at the end, I can totally understand why you pity her. From that point of view, I do pity her. Its just that for me personally the way she tore apart Kyosuke and Kirino, I feel like she mostly doesnt deserve my pity. On another note, I'm really glad that Manami did what she did, especially in the end since, even though she was a big reason for the relationship to develop like a did, in the end she still stuck true to her route of the beginning. She was the only one to really stand up against Kyosuke and Kirino, trying to bring them to understand the ridiculusness of their (current) situation and maybe that was what she saw when she was a elementaryschooler: a ridiculous relationship between Kyosuke and Kirino which she wanted to stop. She always stuck to that plan, and was a voice of rationality"
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Hawkki,2,Sat Jul 26 20:40:01 2014 UTC,"Idk its hard to tell, at least based on the anime, Kirino, upon witnessing Kyousuke scooching closer to Manami to do homework together gets visibly jealous even at that young age so it may have been she would have felt the same way about him later in life. And according to you guys' lN sources, he was doing the things he did to impress her. But its just speculation and doesn't really matter at this point."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,AesopusDota,2,Mon Oct 6 15:33:26 2014 UTC,"These discussions are difficult to have because people are on completely different levels of understanding. The anime cut a significant part of the story from start to finish, and that's Kyousuke's internal monologue and how his thoughts and feelings develop. I honestly think it's the most important aspect of the story, but the anime neglected it and made Kyousuke more of a harem-MC stereotype.   With that in mind, the anime cannot convey the shifting of Kyousuke's outlook on life from start to finish, and it does not convey the effect Manami had and continued to have on his confidence and attitude. Additionally, Kyousuke's side of their childhood was completely left out and made it seem like Manami had no real involvement with Kyousuke's change, while the LNs make it seem like Manami acting due to grudges and out of jealousy is a likely scenario. She was being left behind when Kyousuke found Sakurai, because Sakurai and Kirino encouraged Kyousuke's enthusiasm while Manami disliked it. When you consider that Manami's influence over Kyousuke removed the exact quality that made him compatible with Sakurai and Kirino, and made him incompatible with Manami, her intentions begin to seem more malicious. She then goes on, passively holding him back until he's reinvigorated by his desire to help Kirino once more.  It bothers me that preventing incest weighs in to either side of the argument. She shouldn't be disliked for having the opinion of incest that any normal person would have, and she shouldn't be liked for being the one to stand against it either. That's all petty compared to the larger issue, which can only be understood if you've read the LNs.   With all that considered, it's possible to think that Manami bringing up incest is merely a weapon Manami once used to push Kirino away, because Kirino was Kyousuke's source of support and inspiration. The moment Manami believes things have grown out of her control again, she starts throwing around incest as if it's going to make things how they were when she separated them before. Her outburst at the end demonstrates a grudge she's held towards Kirino, and that grudge has been around long before the first volume.   The gist is she loves Kyousuke and hates Kirino. The side of the story the anime shows is her love for Kyousuke, which is definitely there. Everything she does for him she believes is in his best interest, even if she's not really concerned with what he wants. I've said it before, but she's just possessive in an overprotective mother sort of way. The side of the story that the anime doesn't show is her hate for Kirino and the influence Kirino has on Kyousuke. It's said by Manami in the LNs that young Kyousuke did the things he did to impress his little sister, and Manami disliked Kyousuke's recklessness. Thus, in the same way that Kirino hates Manami for sucking the life from Kyousuke, Manami hates Kirino for inspiring reckless confidence. Kirino expresses her hatred quite blatantly, but Manami does so by pretending the problems of their past never happened. It all comes to a head in the final volume, where their hatred comes to the surface and Manami's façade slips.  Ultimately, she's the stories initiating incident and has pretty much no influence over events. She doesn't deserve nearly as much attention as she gets. If you like her because of her stance against incest then you probably shouldn't have watched Oreimo to begin with. If you hate her because of her stance against incest then you're focusing on all the wrong things."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Deepified,1 point,Sun Jul 27 22:07:30 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, since I have not read the LNs, I cannot talk to most of what you brought up. I would love to have this discussion with you, but, until I read the LNs, all I can say in response is that I like Manami for more than her stand against their incest. From the information available to me, she stands as a voice of reason and logic, but definitely did things wrong. I would not doubt that she did evil things in the LNs, since she did evil things in the anime. But, until I read them, I do not have a complete picture, nor can I even discuss the topics you brought up. I am not qualified to do so. Sorry."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Frondo,0,Sun Jul 27 23:23:13 2014 UTC,"Ahhh... This is what I spoke about.  I want to see proof for your theorie. Not the ""It's all in the LNs""-Stuff one has to witness over, and over, and over in this fandom.   I want exact Lines in the Novel, or in the other given materials (Side-Stories, Games etc.) which are validating your theorie.  Because the stuff you wrote is... mostly made up from ""this and this is proofed by the LN"". In which situation exactly? With what kind of background? The fight at the end of the series? Which opened because Kirino rubbed it in like crazy that she became his girlfriend and that she hopes that Manami suffers, so Kirino can be happy about that?   Do you want to say that Manami should have sit there, holding still, being maybe happy about the other girl, which is bragging so hard in that moment? Even if you are bestfriends with the other one, or even in love: That makes people hurt each other. So is Kyousuke's commentar in LNs about the stuff:  ""So annoying… although she didn't speak to me, I wanted to hit her."" or ""That's enough you bitch! Don't play with my childhood friend like that! When I was about to scold Kirino, a shocking scene happened.""  Is that now proof for some kind of hatred Kyousuke harbours against Kirino? I don't think so."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,sirbob6,1 point,Sun Jul 27 23:54:14 2014 UTC,"""… Isn't Kirino-chan the one who always gets in my way?""  ""A ~ ha ~ didn't you say you had already forgotten about my existence~ ?""  ""… Kuh!""  ""Ah! I was right! You liar!""  ""… Wooooooo! If only Kirino-chan didn't exist! Everything would have gone smoothly!""    How do you explain this, then? In your posts you offer no quotes, only opinion and interpretation, but I'm required to go further in depth than you lest you completely disregard my post? You use a non-canon PSP route as proof and use slippery slope fallacies while ignoring everything that occurs between the Sakurai incident and the fight. If she was so concerned about Kyousuke and Kirino's well being, then why did she stand by idly, leaving the sibling's relationship in shambles while Kyousuke's was completely reliant on her? Surely, being Kyousuke's childhood friend, she would understand how important Kirino was to him?  She did it because it's what she wanted. Whether or not it was her intention from the start doesn't matter, the important thing is she exploited it selfishly and didn't try to make things right until things grew beyond her control.   Jealous Manami   ""I'm so jealous of Sakurai-san.""  Holding her bag, Manami bulged her cheeks out and said:  ""Kyou-chan… recently, you are all Sakurai-san this and Sakurai-san that.""  ""That was because…""  ""That's so nice. I want Kyou-chan to care about me as much as her ~""    Manami disliking Kyousuke's independence   Manami's smile disappeared.  ""Kirino, recently, don't you think Kyou-chan is slowly returning to his old self?""  ""———""  My eyes widened, because I realized.  Kirino smiled wryly.  ""I knew it. I think so too.""    Manami discouraging Kyousuke   ""I plan to visit Sakurai.""  ""Why?""  ""Because I haven't apologized to her.""  ""…Even if you apologize now, it might just cause her more trouble.""  ""You are right. This is to satisfy myself. I'm not doing it 'for someone else.'""  ""Even in that case, how are you going to meet Sakurai-san? She changed her phone number and address; it won't be easy finding them.""  ""Still, it's not totally impossible.""  Where there's a will, there's a way. That's what I believe.    Manami has lost all influence    ""Thank you for your advice. But I have made up my mind.""    The façade drops   Just like Kyou-chan is a normal high school student, I'm also a normal girl.  I can feel angry, jealous —  ""Kanako-chan. Even I have my own ulterior motive.""  ""Haha. How about you tell me?""  She slowly turned to me:  ""Haha… No I won't, because Kanako-chan is one of my strong enemies too. Still… I expect Kirino to cry.""    Additionally, you mentioned that Manami stepped in to help Kyousuke after the Sakurai incident, and I feel you're missing the point with that. If you look at that conversation and the one he has with Kirino after Kuroneko breaks up with him, you'll notice they're very similar, and intentionally so. The important aspect of the incident was not that Kyousuke was endangering others or himself, it's that he felt hopeless and needed someone to help him through it, just as he did post-Kuroneko break up. The key contrast between these scenes is Manami puts him in a three year slum by telling him to become someone else and toss away the problem, while Kirino helps him move forward. Kyousuke fucking up during the Sakurai incident was the time for him to realize his failings and calm down, there's no doubt about it, but Manami let him become someone completely different. He became someone more suitable for her, and she didn't take any action to help him bounce back. What he needed in that scenario was to find Sakurai and apologize as he did in volume 12, and then he could continue living now knowing his restrictions. He does exactly this eventually, but it took three years because of Manami's advice. Yes, her advice was not ""evil"", and most likely didn't have ""evil"" intentions, but the backlash and lack of response from Manami makes her a shitty person regardless of malice.  From your perspective she was protecting him, but in doing so she prevented him from truly learning from his mistakes.   And so you know, I think Manami's a good character because she's a polarizing villain, it just bothers me that people simplify the issue by thinking it has anything to do with incest. I also know that image floating around that paints Manami as an evil puppetmaster is absolute horseshit. It was made to piss off a fan of Manami and was spread solely by the dedication of the person who made it."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,Frondo,1 point,Mon Jul 28 01:25:49 2014 UTC,"From what you have written here, it seems pretty similar to what I think about it, even though I have not yet read the LN's. But thats not what I want to talk about. Even though OP didnt really ask a question, I'd still personally like to know: So how do you feel about Manami after all what you've said? Do you hate her? Pity her? Both? Neither? And why?   Oh, and one more question since you seem to be very proficient and seem to have read the LN's. What came out first? The LN's or the Manga? I was planning on buying both (even though that's pretty expensive :-| ) or do you feel that maybe the LN's offer more than the manga ever could in terms of background information and that sort of stuff?  Anyways, very interesting posts from you with lots of quotes, which makes you the first person here iirc to really have proof for his/her theories and statements. I really enjoyed reading it."
Oreimo,2bs0hn,White_sama,1 point,Mon Jul 28 08:28:46 2014 UTC,"I don't really know what I think. It's not entirely her fault that she has a draining effect on Kyousuke, and some fault lies with Kyousuke for growing dependent on her in the first place. I think her comforting and wanting to be with Kyousuke all those years was fair, but having her hands in the sibling's relationship in their youth was completely out of order. Whether she intended to push Kirino away or not, it was very apparent that she did have an effect her, and as Kyousuke's friend it was her responsibility to try to right her wrongs because family is more important. If she had, she likely would've prevented the whole cold war, the sibling's dramatic recovery, and their love for each other. Instead, she didn't actually try to patch things up until volume 11, seemingly because the siblings had gotten too close.   In the end I suppose my feelings towards the matter are similar to what Kirino thinks by the end. I can appreciate that she helped Kyousuke in a tough time, but I won't ignore how comfortable she was with his drastic change in character. With the sibling's relationship, her actions were ironically her own undoing, and by the end she leaves a sour taste accompanied by a respect that she'll move on with her life and let Kyousuke live his, finally.   The LN came first. The manga is a better adaption than the anime, but it's not finished and is still less thorough than the LN. What's there of the manga isn't a long read, so if you may as well read it as well if you're willing, but if you want the story with all the intricacies, it's the LN you want."

Oreimo,2bnakk,Gersker,4,Fri Jul 25 00:15:43 2014 UTC,"My saddest moment was finding out how and why Kirino became who she is now. I was always thought something had to have happen between her and Kyouske to worsen their relationship, but I was so mad when I discovered it. She looked up to that guy like he was God on earth. Always relied on and could always trust him no matter what. But he thought he was too old and too cool for that, so he just begin avoiding her while playing with his friends. Then we see her transition into a person who grew into unhealthy habits all because of the person she looked up to, rejected her. But I was glad the they repaired the relationship and became siblings (even after the wedding) again while hating each other. I don't know why but that part really spoke to me."

Oreimo,2bnakk,KumoNoAima,4,Fri Jul 25 04:50:50 2014 UTC,"That Kuroneko scene is certainly among them and lately I've come to realize that there's a part of a scene that makes me sad, but which no one else seems to have paid much attention to: the part at the ""wedding"", after the kiss, when Kirino gives the ring back to Kyousuke.  I know I'm reading too much into this (especially as the opposite was confirmed by the author and even the series itself), but it makes me feel like Kirino is rejecting Kyousuke's feelings and saying something like, ""I thought I was still in love with you, but it's been too long and too much has happened and changed.""  Why couldn't she have kept the ring, but not worn it openly? She could have either kept it hidden somewhere (like some good place in her room) or even put it on a necklace or bracelet and sort of worn it ""hidden in plain sight"", somewhere where it wouldn't stand out as much as it would on her ring finger.  (That may sound like a tiny thing, but I occasionally get caught up in symbolism like that :P)  Edit: oh, and talking about sadness: this song is pure sadness, but I can't stop listening to it. Being Kuroneko is suffering... ;_;"
Oreimo,2bnakk,bsoliday88,1 point,Fri Jul 25 06:57:00 2014 UTC,"But I supose that they still love themselves...  And yes, probably that Kirino returns the ring to Kyou , its sad ..  And about the song, its so nice , ill add to my Playlist :) But ill cry everytime that i listen it like this one of Ayase :'(  PS: I started to watch Oregairu and... there's a girl with the same voice of Ayase... Feels xD"
Oreimo,2bnakk,Pl1xpl0x,4,Fri Jul 25 14:08:42 2014 UTC,The saddest part for me was definitely the Kuroneko scene you mentioned. It was the only time during both seasons that I cried.

Really, even hearing the ending from ep 12 with Ayase is just so..awesome but also makes my hearth ache. S2 EP 12 Ending.  What I usually do is watch the episodes which I know are really intense just right before I go to sleep so that I won't be interrupted and then think about them just by myself. Going to bed right after watching something as emotional as some OreImo episodes is just the best thing you can do. You should all really try it out ^  (Or maybe I'm just a tad too emotional about it, idk :-)"

Oreimo,2bgw77,TrustMeIGotHaki,3,Wed Jul 23 19:14:01 2014 UTC,"I dont really get what people hate about the actual ending in the ovas. Without the ovas the show would not be complete imo. And really, what is wrong with how it ended? Would be a true incestious ending really be better? Or a only kuroneko ending?   I like how it ended. For me, it was the end of the show, but not the end of the whole story so I have, in my mind, my own ending for the story. The way the show ended opened up ways for fanfiction to create a more final ending more to the linking of the fans ( like the one 8 picture manga here often linked and such ). I honestly do not know if I really, personally and wholeheartedly would have enjoyed a real ending of either sort (Kirino/Kuroneko/Ayase/whoever). That is one problem I have with harem animes since, even though I usually have a favourite, I dont really want to see 3 out of 4 girls in the end getting rejected.   Ooookay, that actually got me thinking. Do you dislike how it went with the whole ""until graduation"" deal or how kyosuke rejected all them pretty girls?   I wrote this over a longer time so...if something doesnt make sense, im sorry ^"
Oreimo,2bgw77,Pl1xpl0x,1 point,Wed Jul 23 20:05:04 2014 UTC,"I'm just mostly disappointed about how Kyousuke rejected all the girls just so he could spend a short amount of time dating his sister, then ending it immediately after a false wedding. It just feels like the whole series was for nothing. To be honest I would be happier with an ending where Kirino and Kyousuke stay together (inb4 someone brings up the light novel, there aren't that many major differences in the ending). For me some shows/movies are well suited with an ambiguous ending, Oreimo, in my opinion is not."
Oreimo,2bgw77,TrustMeIGotHaki,2,Wed Jul 23 20:10:52 2014 UTC,"Ah, okay. I have to say, what you are saying is also pretty close to how I feel about it. I, too, would have preferred a Kirino x Kyuosuke ending, but now thinking about it maybe it was done so that no fans would be angered.   Acutally, having thought through all of this, I changed my mind :-D Your way of describing it totally makes sense and justifies calling it a ""bad ending"".   You're right, I agree with you :-)"

Oreimo,2bgw77,kiririno,2,Thu Jul 24 00:28:13 2014 UTC,Ah okay.Thanks for the answer :-)  Doesnt sound too bad. Here in germany barely any animes are licensed so we have to almost completely rely on fansubs (which is fine since there are tons of them)

Oreimo,2bgw77,FomorianKing,1 point,Wed Jul 23 05:47:42 2014 UTC,"Eh, I've read the main reason why the ending is the way it is is due to threat from the publisher of not publishing the last volume (incest is taboo. Everyone knows this).  For S1, there are 3 (or was it 4?) extra episodes after S1E12 (the OVAs). In fact, there are two versions of S1E12: the one where Kirino doesn't go away was used as the ending for the S1 TV series (""good ending"" IIRC), and the one where she does leave leads into episodes 13-15/16 and then S2 (the ""true ending""). S2 also had some OVAs after S2E12.  I'm currently reading through the last bit of the light novel. I'd recommend it, because you get to see things a whole lot more from Kyousuke's perspective (I felt the anime was more of a 3rd person perspective than anything). There are also a couple stories that weren't included in the anime. You can find a translation on baka-tsuki."

But other than that, I agreed with a lot of his points. I woulve give it a bit of a higher score though, but that's a bit biased since its my favourite show."
Oreimo,2bdzi7,KirinoMyWaifu,5,Tue Jul 22 13:11:47 2014 UTC,"It's definitely nice not to see someone go and say ""the incest made me uncomfortable, and therefore, this is terrible and no one should watch it"".   I too really enjoyed the soundtrack for the anime, put many of the songs on my phone to listen to at my leisure. It's not some average track list.  Im naturally a bit biased as well because this is my second favorite anime of all time, nearly my favorite, but I hate when people just like to complain about the ending for it's incest, and not for it's poor execution."
Oreimo,2bdzi7,KirinoMyWaifu,5,Tue Jul 22 13:20:14 2014 UTC,"Oh definitely yeah, I cant stand people who look at the title and automatically think then can comment on the show without seeing it, I mean seriously, fuck you guys.   And on the whole incest thing, I didn't have an issue with it, but people seem to think the ENTIRE show is just incest, which it really isn't, bar the last OVA's."
Oreimo,2bdzi7,KirinoMyWaifu,5,Tue Jul 22 14:08:57 2014 UTC,"Indeed, and even the incest displayed isn't of the perverted variety, it's used more in a forbidden love role. I personally, while hating the way the ending was executed, had no qualms with Kirino and Kyousuke ending up together at all. It was expected, and while I grew quite fond of Ruri, I knew he was gonna be with Kirino. It's one of the best ways incest can be portrayed in a non-perverted manor, and people just can't seem to understand that."

Don't trivialize the opinions of others by speaking for them.

I suppose I shouldn't have said most people though, my apologies on that part.   Not everyone's 'hate' is as petty as your 'love'.   There are strikes there for a reason (It's a joke)"
Oreimo,2bdhkt,DJLTheFirst,2,Tue Jul 22 10:37:29 2014 UTC,"Kirino doesn't have the insight the reader has to hate Manami for the same reasons. She hates the effect Manami has/had on Kyousuke, but she couldn't be aware of the intricacies of Manami's actions.  Personally I think that although Manami had mostly good intentions with Kyousuke, she made years of poor decisions to try and turn him into something he wasn't while leaving his relationship with his family in shambles. Throughout the series her actions were in a grey area between helpful and selfish, and her outburst at the end finally pushed it over the edge and made it difficult to interpret her earlier scenes as anything but grudge-driven and possessive."

Oreimo,2ay433,kiririno,1 point,Thu Jul 17 17:11:21 2014 UTC,There's too many shows with imoutos these days. I can't decide who is the best one.
Oreimo,2ay6pl,FomorianKing,10,Thu Jul 17 12:42:24 2014 UTC,"The creator of Oreimo was defiantly going for the incest ending the moment he created the story (see his other work Ero Manga Sensei to notice how he like sisterxbrother stories). The story is called ""My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute"" and the main point of the plot was about repairing the relationship between Kirino and Kyousuke. Also, throughout the series there were definite hints of the feelings between the two so I don't see how Kirino did not deserve the ending."
Oreimo,2ay6pl,fallofmanproductions,2,Thu Jul 17 15:53:43 2014 UTC,"The anime feels forced because it tried to be something it wasn't while being stuck adapting the events of the source material. With the cut romantic development between Kirino and Kyousuke and the emphasis on side characters, it seems like the anime staff tried to make Oreimo a harem when it never was. The result is the main romance and central plot of the story feels ""forced"" by the end because they stuck all the important development in the OVAs because they either couldn't or wouldn't show the establishing incestuous relationship in the anime. Oreimo is a romance first and foremost, but you wouldn't know it from the anime.  The story was never gearing up to pair Kyousuke with Kuroneko. Heck, even in season 2 Kuroneko was irrelevant until episode 7, and then disappeared again after episode 9. I'd like to know what show you were watching if you think the entire thing was gearing up towards Kuroneko and Kyousuke  If you want the series to flow nicely, with all its well thought out foreshadowing and romantic development, you need to read the LNs."
Oreimo,2ay6pl,DinTwo,1 point,Thu Jul 17 18:35:08 2014 UTC,I knew it! Damn it.
Oreimo,2ay6pl,Pl1xpl0x,1 point,Thu Jul 17 19:17:31 2014 UTC,"What do you mean with ""SummerSlam""? About the Kuroneko / Kirino ending, to me in season 1 it felt like it could be just a show about Kirino and Kyosuke restoring their relationship but in season 2, you (or I at least) could really feel that it was heading towards the incest ending. And what also was kinda giving it away that Kuroneko was not really more than something for in-between when you looked at Kuroneko's ..diary or however you wanna call it. In the beginning her ""final / best fantasy"" was a picture of Kyosuke with Kirino, the second version was then with Kuroneko sitting there, but for me the vibe stayed the same.   About Kirino getting what was not rightly hers / was rightly hers, I would say its not only about what Kirino wants. Kyosuke actually wants the same, so I would consider him ...getting together with Kirino was actually what HE wanted himself.   But in the end, I kind of agree with you that the end seemed a little bit forced. I really enjoyed season 1 as what I described it above, but season 2 started giving me a different feeling. I absolutely LOVED season 2, yes, but seeing the sudden appearence of Harem was ..weird. I have not yet read the Manga (planning on it though), but I personally in my little world pretend that season 2 / already the mangas of season 2 if the release date allowed it, was influenced maybe by what the target audience would want/expect.  But I hope and think its very possible that the ending was actually pre-planned and not influenced by anything other than what the author wanted to write / release.  Uuuh, I hope I said everything I wanted to say and it makes sense :-D"
Oreimo,2ay6pl,Noc3,1 point,Thu Jul 17 18:21:11 2014 UTC,SummerSlam is a reference to a whole other fandom.
Oreimo,2ay6pl,TrustMeIGotHaki,0,Thu Jul 17 19:18:10 2014 UTC,"I share your feelings bro, but regardless, things won't change, the author is a crazy fuck and he screwed all of us non-siscons with that ending. You're not the only one who would had liked for them (MC's) to repair their relationship as siblings while ruri winning etc.  you're not alone on disliking the ending, on my anime list there was a poll and over 70% of the answers where ""No"" out of 700+ people responding such poll.  The anime will still go strong as you said the characters are adorable, it sells merchandise well.  but at least I don't plan on watching anything else from this author, and from what I've seen I'm not the only one.  So you can be honest to what you want to do, you're not the only one that feels that way, you're in your own right to like the characters and hate the author for the outcome (Even if this sounds conflicting)."

Oreimo,2aqlh0,KokoLokoKoko,2,Tue Jul 15 05:31:54 2014 UTC,"I think what really motivated me to change was how I could relate in some way to the character Kirino. She was confronted with a difficult decision whether or not to continue living a perfectly ""normal"" life or to go behind her fathers back and continue the otaku life. In my real life, I had to make this decision like this but what I had to give up was my Trading Card Game lifestyle, or lose my current significant other... I really loved both but the circumstances were presented in such a way that I couldnt have both. I was determined to keep both and vowed that I would become successful in a career and be able to prove to my Significant Other that I can have and be both. Determination to fight (justify) my hobbies by finding a job in my career field and to keep my grades (in College/university) up.  TL;DR The character Kirino, resembled some real life events that I was faced with and helped motivate me to love the hobbies that I have and to also have balance in work/life.  Edit for science."

Oreimo,2aqlh0,-Niernen,2,Tue Jul 15 08:24:16 2014 UTC,"I would say for me it isn't that I overcame them, its just that I am coping with the fact that the anime is over. I think what worked best for me was rewatching the anime multiple times and to be honest, visiting Japan. I went to Chiba and saw some of the scenes that were in the anime and I really believe thats what allowed me to be ok with the anime being over. (That and buying everything oreimo known to man) All in all, I believe that as long as Tsukasa Fushimi is still on this planet, he will deliver more moe moe imouto...ness."

Oreimo,2agc8g,BuildBruh,3,Fri Jul 11 23:27:43 2014 UTC,"For approving posts, I'm usually neurotic enough to check around 10 times a day...   But I've mostly stopped delving into comments, mod positions solely for comment checking is available. Other positions can be opened up if the community feels a need for them.    For inquiring moderators, a list of features I personally look for:  1. Helpfulness/Personality - Being a mod is serving the people, the community. Being a mod shares many similarities as a support desk; you have to serve information to people who don't know, repetition generally being infinite. Those whom are helpful in supplying well-worded notifications( and promptly), are favoured in a better light.  2. Attitude/Professionalism - How you type, speak, and handle yourself. Nice, gracious individuals; people who know how to criticize, argue, and speak in a manner without offending. (Be Nice)  3. Dedication To Content(Love) - You may be a Astro-Dolphin Pudding Expert, but you don't really belong here. Individuals whom post on /r/Oreimo regularly, love its material, community, and its future are looked positively. Just a long history isn't necessarily the best criteria.     Above all that, you must love the community. You must love /r/Oreimo.   Only those who are and will be concerned about its current state along with its far future, will be considered for mod-duty.     EDIT: Please don't downvote /r/Chieft0bi  OP Personally messaged me, inquiring about a mod-position but I suggested that OP make a sticky instead. OP isn't trying some powerhungry/popularity scam, we're just asking the community in whole how they feel about the current moderational state of /r/Oreimo.  If you think the sub is fine at the moment, then say so; if not, this is a wonderful place and time to discuss changes."

It's basically the color/B&W art from Oreimo/Nekosis LNs with commentary, other works by the artist, character art (loved this part), the after story and interview.  So you're basically only getting commentary, character art, after story for Oreimo-relatedness if you already own all the Light Novels. Also, price should be a bit lower IMHO."

Oreimo,2a1md7,BuildBruh,2,Mon Jul 7 17:56:18 2014 UTC,Actually... we do that to YnS because its where oreimo couldve/shouldve went with certain characters. The only downfall of it was the lack of building the story in the anime

Play through clannad a couple times without a walk through,  then look up a spoiler free walk through on line to make sure you get all the endings.  Almost all characters have endings, romantic or otherwise, even Sunohara lol ; P.  Anyways, have fun!  PM me later on and maybe we can talk some more about our Lord and Savior Fuuko...  PS: If you reach enough endings in Clannad, it unlocks a special new main menu option called After Story, that basically continues with like another 5 hours of awesome about Nagisa after her true end in the game.  Really some of the best writing of this genre."

Its a short movie without any tsundere characters or something of that sort. The Anime was also made into a movie with real actors, well I think they were kinda amateurs but its not too bad anyways.  ( I can search for it if u want :-D ).  But Boku wa Imouto ni Koi wo Suru is...really different. Depends on what you are looking for I would say, but if you have about 45 minutes to spare, you might be able to enjoy it :-D Just dont hate me, if its totally not your type of stuff, I'm not even sure how I feel about that myself.  Well, hope that helps lol, kinda wrote too much :-D"
Oreimo,2a1md7,RyoukoAsakura,2,Mon Jul 7 22:50:37 2014 UTC,"I've had that on my to-watch list for a while and I finally decided to give it a go. It was sort of what I was expecting (a bit too much drama for my taste -- not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just usually not my thing), but also much more than that.  A really beautiful (but somewhat sad ;_;) anime with nice soundtrack and some great scenes: those missing shoes when Yori was about to leave had me laughing and that scene at the train station was brilliant (I can't help but feel sorry about Kusunoki, though).  I really liked that -- thanks for getting me to watch it :)"

Oreimo,2a1md7,Xanderish,3,Tue Jul 8 19:13:26 2014 UTC,"MM! is also a harem and has Taketatsu Ayana (Kirino's voice actress) in a tsundere role.  OniAi is hilarious, if you don't mind some fan service (seeing how you've watched To Love-Ru, Kiss X Sis and such, you probably don't ;) and it also has an imouto with a brother complex.  I'd also recommend Haiyore! Nyaruko-san. It's quite different in tone, but it's also a harem and it's among the funniest anime I've watched. Nyaruko-san is also full of references to other anime, games, Japanese TV shows, etc. and they're pretty fun to spot (I think there was at least one Oreimo reference thrown in, maybe more)."

Oreimo,29w9tt,DinTwo,4,Sat Jul 5 19:18:40 2014 UTC,This image is two year old flamebait.   Correction: Three year old flamebait.
Oreimo,29w9tt,-Niernen,10,Sat Jul 5 19:59:58 2014 UTC,"Sigh.... Have you read the Light Novels? Probably not.   Ayase- While she is not understanding at the beginning, she does try. While she may never understand Kirino's hobby, she comes to accept that is how it is and actually tries to be more supportive of her (and Kyousuke). She actually understands Kyousuke well, but she does not show it till she confesses.   Kirino- Not much to say, I'm sure someone else will, but its mostly correct.  Kuroneko- Abrasive? Yes, definitely at first. But thats to most normal people, and because of her chuunibyou. She is way into it, but she will eventually grow out of it. And she's not too abrasive to Kyousuke while dating (till the whole break up thing). And her ideal world was the one where they are all together, happy forever. (Unlike Kirino, who only cared for her happiness)   Saori- Yes, Saori is the glue that held them together. She is laid back, understands, plans well. No, she does not reveal she is rich, but think of the front she put up just to hand out with them. She can barely see them at first without being in her Bajeena personality. In the PSP games, she is way to nervous to do anything in her normal personality at first. Sure, with the help of the others she comes out of her shell slowly, but without them she woulds still probably  be all secluded. She really did have some emotional problems.  All the girls have different flaws. They all have different pro's too (besides the fact that their cute in an impossible way irl). Each person obviously would have their favorite, and Saori does get left to the side (because she was never focused as a love intrest), but she is not perfect either. You have to know both sides, the good and the bad, otherwise you really don't know them at all."
Oreimo,29w9tt,DinTwo,6,Sat Jul 5 14:12:18 2014 UTC,"Sigh.... Have you read the Light Novels? Probably not.    Have you? This image's description of Kirino was written based on season 1 anime Kirino, and yet you seem to think it's mostly correct. You've also gone ahead and suggested that Kirino only cared about herself when anyone with an elementary understanding of the LNs would know that isn't true. Heck, even if you'd watched the anime you would know she told Kyousuke to pursue Kuroneko, tried to get them back together, and immediately asked about Kuroneko when Kyousuke confessed. This isn't the behavior of someone who only cares for themself, and that isn't even going into how much she cares for Kyousuke, and how much she didn't want to lose Ayase. You come off as attempting to speak impartially but your post is thick with bias, making Kirino out to be the devil while all of Kuroneko's flaws are pros in disguise."
Oreimo,29w9tt,-Niernen,-7,Sat Jul 5 20:05:22 2014 UTC,"I left it open for others. So, Is she physically abusive? Yes.   Would she ridicule you? Yes.   Was she  not proud of who she was? Yes, she was at the beginning. I realize most of the stuff is outdated.   By care for herself, she is the one that gets everything. Yes, it may not be 100% true, but by the way she acts, she gets what she wants over other characters the majority of the time. She is selfish. And I never said I was impartial, nor did I ever try to make Kirino out to be a devil. And how did I try to make Kuroneko's chuunibyou a pro? I just said she gets over it later (as in the psp routes if they get kids an all), which in no way makes it a pro. You seem to focus on the last light novel or two, when Kirino has changed, but for the majority of the series that's how she was. They all changed, but Kirino is pretty abusive. Even in the last few, her Tsun side is still very present."
Oreimo,29w9tt,DinTwo,7,Sat Jul 5 20:29:49 2014 UTC,"Would she ridicule you?   So would Kuroneko, probably even moreso. In the LNs Kuroneko is much more rude and confrontational, if you're forgetting. This point is true but the contrast between Kirino and Kuroneko in the chart is not.    Was she not proud of who she was?   She was secretive because she had other concerns, but ultimately what she wasn't proud of was her love for Kyousuke, not her otaku hobbies. Hiding your power level doesn't mean you are not proud of yourself, Kirino is very proud of her collection.    By care for herself, she is the one that gets everything.   This is a matter of working towards achieving what she wants, not selfishness. You said she only cared for herself and I've already explained why that's not true.  You're trying to excuse yourself by saying you realize it's outdated, but that didn't stop you from going ahead considering Ayase's development while you've completely neglected Kirino's. Also, I don't know why you'd think Kirino is abusive by the end. She doesn't hit Kyousuke past volume 7 unless he intentionally provokes a reaction out of her.   You say that's how Kirino was for most of the series, yet you use the single volume Kuroneko is dating Kyousuke as an example in her defense. Kuroneko is abrasive and insulting for the majority of the series, and her tsun side is very present at the end as well.   Even if you're not doing it intentionally, the bias is still blatantly obvious, and it's shocking to see you claim to have read the LNs and try to correct others when your viewpoint is incredibly skewed and sometimes downright incorrect.  It's funny how praising Kuroneko on this subreddit drowns you in upvotes, but if you suggest she's anything but a flawless angel you get torn to pieces. She's an incredibly flawed person and as irritating as volume 1-2 Kirino, for a lot of the same reasons. It's why they get along."

I mean, sure, she's 100% self-serving...or is she? She makes a real effort to try to consciously improve herself in terms of personal relationships which is something that no one else does, other than Kyousuke and maybe Kirino.  She's the only one it seems whom Kyousuke can really communicate with on an honest level: they can joke with each other, tease each other, and insult each other without fear of real reprisal. Kyousuke is more open and himself with Kanako than any other girl, including Manami.  I've read the light novels and rewatched the series two or three times now and each time I gain a new appreciation of Kanako. She's not the perfect girl to date but once you figure her out she'd be a pretty cool friend."

I still feel empty whenever I watch something, or hear something from the show, but at least it's not as much as it used to be."
Oreimo,29l2a3,KirinoMyWaifu,3,Tue Jul 1 19:28:40 2014 UTC,I watched Yosuga no Sora. That show is incest done right.

Oreimo,29l2a3,BlackOdder,2,Wed Jul 2 14:48:15 2014 UTC,"Just watch other anime and it goes away. I liked Kirino a lot when I finished it and was feeling kind of weird because of liking that incestual relationship. 2 weeks after being finished it with the anime I solved my problem by starting to like Kuroneko a little more(by listening to her theme songs).  What filled my Post-Oreimo-Depression was actually K-On!, which is an amazing show aswell. Azusa has the same voice actor as Kirino does. Watching other anime really helps you getting over old anime. Other anime I can recommend are Kanon, Clannad, Suzumiya Haruhi and Toradora."

Oreimo,29i7nn,UnmannedSurveillance,1 point,Mon Jun 30 21:02:31 2014 UTC,Kuroneko should be nearly as tall as Kirino if it's proper scale.
Oreimo,29i7nn,DinTwo,1 point,Tue Jul 1 03:09:14 2014 UTC,"Yeah, Kirino is only 5cm taller."
Oreimo,29i7nn,Fissie,3,Tue Jul 1 17:23:26 2014 UTC,"Unforunately there's only 3 height selections and Kuroneko looks so much better at that height in the game. Besides, I don't really chase Kirino that much - she's being all weird and jealous but never actually wants to talk me... I guess she came out pretty accurate.  Kuroneko on the other hand asked me out on a date and before the weekend asked to be lovers and was even getting frisky in class.  Manami has been a total slut and was one of the first girls to start having sex. I checked her stats and apparently she done anal with the first guy to make a move on her. She also keeps saying weird stuff about being treated like a dog feels nice - ugh, not going near that although ironically her and Kirino are friends :P  http://i.imgur.com/puVZGZv.jpg I also added in some Haganai characters. http://i.imgur.com/YyFqkJ9.jpg  Fun times when drama starts between the two casts."

Oreimo,29bdbo,Katsana,10,Sat Jun 28 11:23:39 2014 UTC,"Im not 100% sure, but from what I have gathered so far, its kinda common in Japan for younger kids to use the terms ""Onii- "" and ""Onee-"" for other teens who are older than them. Or were you refering to the ""-sama"" part? I just checked a few parts where Ayase calls him ""Onii-san"", but not sama. And ""-san"" is used for people you work with and or are older than you. Kinda like ""Mr. Kyosuke"". Hope that helped, but I might also be completely wrong l0l."
Oreimo,29bdbo,Pl1xpl0x,4,Sat Jun 28 12:42:11 2014 UTC,"that explains it. thanks, was a bit hazy on it :D"
Oreimo,29bdbo,konohasaiyajin,4,Sat Jun 28 13:24:46 2014 UTC,I think it's also just because she's Kirino's best friend.  It's common for someone to address a very close friend's relative as if they were a relative themselves.
Oreimo,29bdbo,Pl1xpl0x,1 point,Sun Jun 29 08:56:05 2014 UTC,glad I could help :-D
Oreimo,29bdbo,picflute,8,Sat Jun 28 20:24:29 2014 UTC,Ayase was raised to address people formally. Whenever she needs something from Kyousuke she'll address him as Onii-Sama and when talking casually she'll address him as Onii-San

Oreimo,292kb6,sirbob6,1 point,Wed Jun 25 20:40:49 2014 UTC,"Well, the styles shown are varied because he was a key animator on those shows, so he had to perfectly emulate whatever the original style was.

Oreimo,27qh0t,timw4mail,1 point,Tue Jun 10 13:29:51 2014 UTC,Because you are probably looking at the standard box set price (pink box). The S2 LE set price is about on par with the S1 Limited Edition DVD set (green box).
Oreimo,27qh0t,Histy,1 point,Wed Jun 11 03:26:48 2014 UTC,"Well the first one didn't have a whole lot of things. The only special things it had was textless opening and endings which are standard.

This Season 2 boxset looks like it might actually come in a box instead of a sleeve and has a whole lot more special features and bonus things."

Oreimo,27kuhw,Neosword3000,2,Sat Jun 7 22:33:22 2014 UTC,Of course Oreimo is owned by Aniplex. I was wondering why it was neither dubbed nor on Blue-ray... -_-

Oreimo,27kuhw,Neosword3000,2,Sun Jun 8 02:25:25 2014 UTC,I legitimately hate Aniplex of America. It bothers me that anybody actually pays their insane prices.
Oreimo,27kuhw,fallofmanproductions,2,Sun Jun 8 02:36:58 2014 UTC,I too hate Aniplex. The way they have handled Madoka Magica and the way they are currently handing Kill la Kill make me so glad for companies like Funimation.
Oreimo,27kuhw,Neosword3000,6,Sun Jun 8 02:46:07 2014 UTC,"Then again, all of Aniplex's major shows are currently available on Netflix. By that, I mean Fate/Zero, Sword Art Online, Madoka Magica, FMAB, and Kill la Kill. You have to give them props for that."
Oreimo,27kuhw,kiririno,1 point,Sun Jun 8 02:50:03 2014 UTC,But not Oreimo. :(
Oreimo,27kuhw,Histy,1 point,Sun Jun 8 05:58:00 2014 UTC,"It is available on Crunchyroll, as many Aniplex/A-1 Pictures titles are. They do want you to watch and enjoy the shows, but that doesn't necessarily mean you need to buy it in physical form if the price isn't in your budget.  As /u/TsundereNetwork pointed out, Aniplex does include a ton of extras and bonuses with their releases. Their releases are fairly high in quality because they sacrifice less than others. Madoka Magica, Kill la Kill, Sword Art Online and even Oreimo, put about four episodes per disc. This is in comparison to other distributors that try to squish at least 6-7 episodes per disc (sometimes along with a dub audio track), which directly affects video and audio quality.  Also, as AoA is affiliated with Aniplex, they are not forced to follow the Western anime market demand like the US-based distributors are. They could leave the market and it wouldn't be a huge issue for them. But not selling anime for dirt cheap as the norm has been can be the end of publishers like Funimation.  They probably understand that shows like Madoka Magica, Oreimo, Sword Art Online, Kill la Kill, FMA:B, Gurren Lagann, Monogatari and Fate/Zero are shows that can sell for the prices that they do. At the same time, we might see Aniplex titles such as Katanagatari, Persona, Working/Wagnaria, Love Lab and Anohana licensed to other companies and sold at a cheaper price. Some shows might be coveted more than others."
Oreimo,27kuhw,kiririno,1 point,Sun Jun 8 09:40:33 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I understand. It's just disappointing."
Oreimo,27kuhw,TsundereNetwork,2,Sun Jun 8 16:36:54 2014 UTC,"It's all about different business models. (Numbers are just an example) Aniplex: Sell few but at a higher price. 20 Units X $100 = 2000  Funimation: Sell more but at a lower price. 50 Units x $40 = 2000  Plus Aniplex has more of a collector feel towards the product; often times including extras etc. Also once they go out of print they stay out of print. Take for example Kara no Kyokai Blu-ray, released by Aniplex.  Originally $600 but sold out within a couple of hours, the price now from other people selling it, $1000. Of course the DVD is still available but still.  Don't think i'm fanboying over Aniplex, trust me I want the Oreimo Blu-ray, its just not fair to compare them to Funimation whose business model differs, which results in different ways of going about how they sell their items."
Oreimo,27kuhw,fallofmanproductions,1 point,Sun Jun 8 05:34:25 2014 UTC,I find it perfectly fair to compare the companies. They are competing in the same space and for the same customers. I just believe that Funimation's model is better for me because when I buy one of their products I don't feel like I am over paying for the product. With Aniplex I feel like I am paying too much for a product that is same (or sometimes less like Aniplex cutting Kill la Kill into 4 episodes a set) value that Funimation offers. I understand the different models but I just feel that Aniplex is charging premium price for products that don't not need a premium price tag.
Oreimo,27kuhw,TsundereNetwork,1 point,Sun Jun 8 05:49:35 2014 UTC,"I know, and to be quite frank, I have to agree with you on a lot of points but having Aniplex do their way of business is what drives capitalism. It forces Funimation to sell at the prices they do. Well not particularly forces them but incentives them. You know what I mean."
Oreimo,27kuhw,fallofmanproductions,1 point,Sun Jun 8 05:58:43 2014 UTC,I just wish they offered more bare bones regular editions. I would not even care if they marked it up a little bit more than normal. I am willing to give them money but I am not crazy. :P

I just like Kirino as a character, it's not the fact she's Kyousuke's sister that makes me want to see them together."
Oreimo,27jy9l,White_sama,3,Sat Jun 7 22:25:36 2014 UTC,"Because on incest you have two sides. People that are all ""ban this sick filth"" and people that are all ""fuck yeah, incest!"".

If you can't answer or the only answer you can find is ""It's instinct"", then it's the same for incest or any other fetish. Or for anything you like really. Why do you like that character over that one? That food over that one.

Also Yukimura is Kouhei Akagi while Rika is Sena Akagi (see Kyousuke x Kouhei). Kobato and Maria are essentially a more competitive Bridget and Kanako. Sena reminds me the most of Kuroneko (she shares Kirino's hobbies, but has a personality closer to Ruri), while Stella is like a Saori stand-in."

Replacing Ruri with Ayase does not change the outcome of this choice, but I chose Ruri in this case because I like her more.  (Before I get downvoted/bashed, I'd like to point out that I'm not bashing Kirino, I only think that having one mildly irritated person (Kirino) is way better than having 3+ incredibly devastated people (Ruri, Ayase, Manami, etc). Kirino did nothing wrong, Kyousuke did. I also didn't include Kanako because I don't think it would make a good ending)  Edit: Why is my ""6."" showing up as ""1."", oh well."

Meruru does have some similarities with PMMM, but it's in fact more of a parody of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha. For example, Meruru kills her friend in some sort of magical field with maximum power laser beam, and her friend doesn't actually die once the field disappearsbecause magic and this concept is a paradoy from Lyrical Nanoha.  Also, the weapons and attacks are very similar to those in Lyrical Nanoha too."

The author probably intended to reference all such magical shoujo series, but the anime adapts what the licence holder can. As such, lots of Aniplex-specific (SAO, PMMM, etc.) references are to be expected.  It also works the other way 'round. Oreimo references exist in series such as Railgun, Anohana, etc."

Oreimo,26lqug,webtax,6,Wed May 28 08:18:00 2014 UTC,Weird. If you download the image and open it in an image viewer it looks like the thumbnail image. You can also see the imgur version of the image in the downloaded image as a moire into the background of the image.  If I had to guess (speaking as an engineer) it has to do with how sub-pixel rendering happens and image aliasing of the scaled image.  It appears to render differently in other browsers than chrome too. Chrome-related bug related to its image rendering system?
Oreimo,26lqug,ergzay,2,Wed May 28 00:19:30 2014 UTC,"It's actually due to the gamma value of PNG images being interpreted differently by different software, web browsers in particular. Here's one article about the issue, if you're interested about the technical details.  If you open the image in a program that allows you to adjust the image gamma (or colour curves), you can see both images like this. The first image shows the image as it normally appears in GIMP and the second shows how you can see the other image by adjusting the colours.  Edit: oh, and the reason the thumbnail and the actual image are different (on most browsers that is), is because the thumbnail is a JPEG image generated from the original PNG image and the gamma information is dropped in the thumbnail generation process."

Oreimo,269ngf,KokoLokoKoko,3,Fri May 23 04:08:01 2014 UTC,Dutchguy was a tripposter on /a/ whose waifu was Manami. Him and another tripposter would shit up oreimo threads normally hating on Kirino. I can't remember (and too lazy to look it up) what he did but he had a huge negative reaction to the release of the 12 novel. Basically he doesn't believe most of the final volumes are canon and Manami is best girl.  Basically he's a joke.

Oreimo,25yzzl,bbdbike,13,Tue May 20 19:58:57 2014 UTC,"Stalker arc in the light novels didn't end up getting to the anime. Some say it didn't get animated because it's something similar that actually happened to the author in real life, others say they just didn't have enough time to animate the arc.  Below is this ""stalker in real life"" happening in a nutshell for the people interested.  Fushimi Tsukasa was threatened with mailing (initially estimated to be about 500 threatening mails, but in the end they found out it was almost 9000 mails) by some crazy Kirino fan getting mad about Kuroneko and Ayase making more appearence and thus Kirino getting less attention. In the end the guy got arrested and got sentenced to serve in jail for a yearonly if he waited till 2013 lol. Rumours say Tsukasa was inspired from this happening to write the Ayase stalker arc"

Oreimo,25yzzl,DinTwo,9,Tue May 20 05:12:47 2014 UTC,? I don't recall having stupid agenda or hate in this comment. Care to explain?
Oreimo,25yzzl,DJLTheFirst,-13,Tue May 20 05:21:21 2014 UTC,"He asked about a scene left in the anime and you went off on a loaded tangent spreading a rumor which we both know can be and is misinterpreted by people looking for reasons to blame the sinking of their ship.   The arc is about Ayase and you've somehow made it about your hate for Kirino and those who like her.   edit: Frankly I'm surprised this sort of thing is even allowed here. You've basically created a hategroup, and anyone who dares to speak against you is drowned in downvotes. It's not something that should be left ignored. You perpetrate the idea that best girl wars should be central to /r/oreimo but it adds little but petty feuds. It's fine when it's in good fun, but yours is actually driven by spite, and your insipid war cries are spam at best.  edit2: You are not the creator of the hategroup and I am silly.

Oreimo,25yzzl,DinTwo,5,Tue May 20 05:29:37 2014 UTC,"You could take your time and read what I've commented there again. First off, it's not a rumour and the arrested person stated it in the courts when he was sentenced, but that's not even the biggest problem here.  I am sorry for those incapable of taking facts and assume that I am trying to put the blame on Kirino, but read again and I never put the hate on the entire Kirino fanbase. You are the one that's assuming that I am hating on the entire Kirino fanbase because I decided to just mention that the crazy culprit is Kirino supporter. No, wrong. I sincerely hope that you didn't just go straight to assuming ""this guy mentioned someone who's clearly not normal as Kirino supporter, he must be trying to attacking the entire Kirino fanbase.""  Anyone with common sense would be able to conclude that one crazy person in a group of people does not necessarily represent the entire group. And I am fine with most of the Kirino or Ayase or any other fan groups as long as they don't attack on my ship first. You are just overreacting to something that's supposed to be informative. I honestly can't find where I put in the hate for Kirino and those who like her in my comment.  No tl;dr. Read the entire thing."
Oreimo,25yzzl,DJLTheFirst,-3,Tue May 20 06:48:50 2014 UTC,"I reacted the way I did because I've seen the exact same thing cited as damage control for the Kuroneko fanbase a number of times, and I hope you don't mind that you pulling back after being called out on it doesn't necessarily make me accept your sincerity.   I do admit I wrongfully confused you with TrustMeIGotHaki who certainly does not stand for the same things you seem to with regards to other characters and their fans, but you've associated yourself close enough to that group that it's easy enough to assume you share the same ideologies, and looking at your other posts I'm still not entirely convinced you don't.  There's no sense arguing your intentions, and as I was confused I likely misjudged them, but my point still stands about the Rurisquad business and the malice it carries."
Oreimo,25yzzl,DinTwo,4,Tue May 20 07:08:28 2014 UTC,"I don't know which of my posts have made you to think that I would attack other fanbase senselessly but you can have my words that I won't be the first one to fire the trigger, if that convinces you. Translation: I don't like arguing online. It's silly. Stahp pls  About the Rurisquad, it's only like 2~3 weeks old, new group of people loving Kuroneko. Although I can't see and check everything that has happened with Rurisquad, so it's just my opinion but it hasn't done something that terribly offends the others yet. So just give it some time before just hating on it. And also I am mentioning it again but don't be so prejudiced against a certain group because of few people in that group.  Now, did we clear all the misunderstandings and just peace out? ಠ‿ಠ"

Admittedly much of it, though not all, is Haki, but he is the one running it and that's the direction he's trying to take it."

I honestly just vote for the cutest of the match, even if it's Kirino. If you need any proof, here are my votes for the first round.  But it's true that Rurisquad doesn't like Kirino, but I wouldn't say that one of its main purposes is hating Kirino. At least that's how I see it, but in heart of every Kuroneko fan there is a grudge against Kirino, even though no matter how you look at it, it was mostly Kyousuke's fault.

Oreimo,25yzzl,webtax,3,Tue May 20 05:30:02 2014 UTC,"It leads into an animated special which was packaged with the episode in the BD, which I assume mentions an audio drama in which the Ayase-Stalker arc is adapted.

Oreimo,25ktpa,AesopusDota,2,Thu May 15 14:46:18 2014 UTC,"There are at least three translations of that TV size version of this song (Commie, AsukaSubs, EveTaku) and I'd recommend the EveTaku version.   I don't know much about AsukaSubs, but at least Commie has a habit of being a bit too literal with their translations (especially with songs) and sometimes they even do minor trolling with their subs. EveTaku generally does very good subs and having seen all three translations of this song (the TV size version from the end of the episode), I'd definitely recommend them.  They have torrents and direct downloads here.  I wish I knew enough Japanese to translate this song, since at least the parts I can understand are really beautiful and very ""Kuroneko"" in the way they are written. The crushing sadness of the song is also beautiful in its own way.  Edit: oh, gosh, I think I've listened to this song more than hundred times already. I just can't get this out of my head."

So it seems like anything she does there will be suffering, and the author is aware of it hence the kirino recordings, I'm even starting to believe that maybe even the author got himself into a more complex topic than what he thought he could even handle.  There just seems to be no winners in this story, maybe just Saori who's dream of having her own circle of friends came true."

Oreimo,25h7pb,sirbob6,5,Wed May 14 02:33:45 2014 UTC,"I'll try to address most issues:   Firstly, the thing with the author was that he wanted a full incest ending but his publishers/editors said no (incest is generally a no-no in the industry, even though it is still done occasionally). As a result, his newest book features a step-sister instead. The relationships: Most relationships were not that effected, the game club's opinion varied from being neutral (the two twins) to being supportive (Sena and the president, probably Kaede). Mikagami probably gave the most support out of anyone (he's heavy expanded on in the LN). Kōhei (also heavily expanded upon in the LNs, seriously the best character in them) is probably nuetral in the matter. Also, the LN explains he is a siscon in a platonic way, even though he tries to buy a sex doll that looks like Sena. Ruri and Saori is acceptant of the relationship. Kanako is probably too oblivious to notice or care (also expanded upon in the LN). As for Ayase, it is most likely that that relationship is probably sunk (LN contains an arc where Kyousuke finds out who is stalking here and ran that one creepy fansite of her, which is why she became more romantically inclined.) And of course, any relations with Manami went up in a hellish flame. So in the end, probably only two relations are destroyed. The ""incest is the best"" is basically what he says, I don't remember the exact translation but it is something along those line. Yeah, it was a pretty dick move. The last scene in the LN has Kyosuke kiss Kirino on the lips instead of the cheek (with a much cuter reaction) and the life consoling is implied to be them continuing their romantic relations, just like how it started them.   I would suggest reading through this, which has quite a bit of useful information in regards to the ending and other aspects of the series (AesopusDota already posted the relationship development picture in it). On a side note, I'm pretty sure most people watch Mikakunin for how cute Mashiro is and Kobeni's waifu potential, not the MC (plus, though quiet, he did have some good lines)."
Oreimo,25h7pb,sagrado_corazon,1 point,Tue May 13 23:29:16 2014 UTC,Isn't there also a short story after the main books where life is continuing on as normal(otaku irl meetings/hangouts) and such but in one scene Kyousuke kisses her to tease her?
Oreimo,25h7pb,Hawkki,2,Wed May 14 05:32:49 2014 UTC,"I think that's the epilogue. As far as I know the author hasn't released any material that takes place after the final LN yet, though he did write one for the Ruri PSP ending. However, he will be releasing a new oreimo story sometime."

Oreimo,25h7pb,Ryukononon,3,Wed May 14 01:49:23 2014 UTC,"Warning you are about to read a comment based of a guy who is still learning english , Well...""fucked up the other relationships"".. hmmmm I dont know, i always hear this, but isnt kuroneko still kyousuke´s friend? even Ayase, Saori even Kanako, I have my doubts with Manami but she is a childhood friend, you cant broke a relantionship entirely just because that person dosent love you...at least if is just too damn painful because some shit happened. If you have a ""harem"" and if you love just one of them, how suppose you are goin to make happy to the rest of them, is not possibly. Also something seems really odd, when kuroneko tells Kyousuke about they are not goin to be in a love relationship anymore, she implies that those 2  - kirino and kyousuke - are goin to be a couple forever, therefore she didnt know about their Promise. - in the absurd possibility that kyousuke is ok with that because as we all know he kissed Kirino mouth to mouth broking his promise-  and if you want to have another perspective about the ending  you can read this post http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1kl8or/spoilersore_no_imouto_ga_konnani_kawaii_wake_ga/cbq632r I have to be honest, I really felt bad for kuroneko speciallly after i read the novels and I dont hate Manani anymore, I really love Oreimo and I learn something different almost everyday from each character, even if is not perfect, I really love it, this might be my favorite anime in my entire life, and im really really happy they didnt go with the generic ""Not related by blood"" ending."

Oreimo,25a1j1,DJLTheFirst,3,Sun May 11 14:05:16 2014 UTC,"I thought so too, but you just have to give it some time."
Oreimo,25a1j1,kiririno,3,Sun May 11 15:10:38 2014 UTC,What I do after I finish an anime that leaves a big impact is that I watch something completely different that can't be compared to what I watched before
Oreimo,25a1j1,klumpKlumpen,2,Sun May 11 21:08:08 2014 UTC,Maybe you should start of with another harem show? Give Mayo Chiki a try. The animation is pretty similar and the main character has some similarities to Kyouske.
Oreimo,25a1j1,Kapten-N,11,Sun May 11 14:39:58 2014 UTC,I actually don´t think I liked it because of the harem but because of Kirino :d
Oreimo,25a1j1,Cherry_Venus,1 point,Sun May 11 16:28:04 2014 UTC,"Maybe try Mikakunin. The mc is this amazing imouto, and there's a siscon character that makes Kyousuke look like nothing."
Oreimo,25a1j1,calvcoll,1 point,Tue May 13 03:52:08 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I have had that problem, it stopped me watching for weeks, what I did was find a show that everyone agreed to be pretty awesome, and completely different, I went for Evangelion. Though I believe it shows how well the story was written, and acted. One of the many reasons why I love Oreimo."
Oreimo,25a1j1,SaintEx,1 point,Sun May 11 23:09:58 2014 UTC,"I suggest you try Nisekoi. I'm sure you've heard about it, as it's been gaining popularity. If you're not interested in that, then try out No Game No Life. It's also been gaining attention lately and it's extremely good as well."
Oreimo,25a1j1,Rytho,1 point,Sun May 11 23:56:14 2014 UTC,"There's a lot of people suggesting anime that's in a similar genre, which is fine. Another thing you may want to consider though is just trying one in a completely different genre. So maybe a supernatural anime (I really liked Another) or a scifi. That way, you feel less compelled to make comparisons since it's like comparing oranges and apples. In any case, I'm sure you'll get over it sooner than you think."

Matches as in you vote for one of the two character, and the votes will be counted to indicate a winner, necklace showdown is not included in matches. At the end of Aug, 32 characters with highest scores will continue in elimination round. From this point on, the character who loses in a match will be eliminated. The last character standing in the elimination will win the tiara.  Necklace showdown takes 7 top score characters from both categories, and they will compete for the necklace. There are five necklaces and the winners of previous necklaces cannot attend the showdown. Necklace has no effect on the scores, they are just an honor to have.

Oreimo,257wgq,FliryVorru,1 point,Sat May 10 19:00:12 2014 UTC,would you say K-ON is good? been looking for more anime to watch
Oreimo,257wgq,Kapten-N,5,Sat May 10 20:06:19 2014 UTC,"K-ON! is not a good anime. It is an outstanding anime. It's what the ""10"" rating on MAL was made for.  It has a captivating story with engaging characters. It almost feels like a slice of life with its humor and care-free attitude, but the story moves at a great pace. Speaking of which, every episode matters and advances the plot at least slightly - this is a lost art in a lot of shows in general these days. You'll have to find an excuse to not watch half a season in one sitting.  If you're a fan of good music, it's some of the best you'll hear in anime. The songs the band plays are catchy as heck (Don't Say Lazy may or may not be one of my ringtones) and you'll sing along by the end.  Do yourself a favor and watch it. You will laugh endlessly, shed a few tears, and be completely drawn into their world. Seriously, if you don't openly weep towards the end of the second season send me a PM and I'll buy you a month of gold. It's the most moved I've ever been during a comedic anime.  TL;DR - Hell yes."
Oreimo,257wgq,Hoogyme,2,Sat May 10 21:04:38 2014 UTC,"There isn't much of a story to speak of and the animation is subpar, but you're still gonna be smiling like an idiot while watching it. It is well worth a watch if you like slice of life shows."
Oreimo,257wgq,FliryVorru,1 point,Sun May 11 14:31:45 2014 UTC,"Great, now that I've just finished watching K-On again, now I'm going to have to watch Oreimo. I never noticed this."
Oreimo,257wgq,bulletboy411,1 point,Sun May 11 03:33:57 2014 UTC,"In fairness, she sounds a bit different in K-ON than in her other roles. Whereas, you could put pictures of Rinka (Nakaimo), Ayumi (TWGOK), and Ako (KissxSis) back-to-back in a video with her speaking and they'd all sound right."
Oreimo,257wgq,AesopusDota,3,Sun May 11 04:36:41 2014 UTC,"Before I watched the anime, I saw gifs of Ayase and Kuroneko and at that point (since they both had blue eyes and black hair) I thought they were the same person  -_- man I'm dumb."
Oreimo,257wgq,AesopusDota,5,Sat May 10 17:36:36 2014 UTC,Ayase and Saori(without glasses) look a bit similiar and I was worried I might confuse them while watching
Oreimo,257wgq,White_sama,3,Sat May 10 18:22:31 2014 UTC,definitly. the episode where they went to her house(apartment/flat?) i thought 'why is ayase there?'

Every ""potential"" coupling or ending caters to a different character-type; tsundere, childhood-friend, imouto, goth-loli, etc. Just because the ending in this video doesn't match up with what you or I envision being the ""best"" ending doesn't make it stupid. It's different, but it's not stupid.   Getting married and everyone's okay with it even dad? Bullshit.   Even the best fiction can have some unrealistic elements. That's the whole reason we watch anything sci-fi or fantasy, after all. As Coleridge said, it's the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" that allows us to most enjoy fiction.

Oreimo,24opl7,Adept94,6,Sun May 4 10:49:55 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I know, most hated character, blah blah...  Still it's her birthday today (stated in the novels when Kyousuke was worried about her having a boyfriend), so we can think about her positive deeds, like saving her best friend from self-destruction, staying by his side for years, while continous being called a granny and being ignored for the biggest part and being concerned about the two Kousakas, since she hasn't killed of their relationship by telling Daisuke!"
Oreimo,24opl7,TrustMeIGotHaki,2,Sun May 4 10:57:45 2014 UTC,"I don't even know why she's hated lol, she was like #2 or #3 waifu imo"
Oreimo,24opl7,-Niernen,5,Sun May 4 17:59:09 2014 UTC,"She's hated because she has the biggest impact on Kyousuke, on the story and on the flow of the story.   Because there are two possible ways to look at LN 11:   Either she ruined Kyousuke, by ""killing of his ambition"", ""ruining the relationship between Kirino and Kyousuke"" and ""trying to turn kyousuke into her ideal husband"".  or  She helped him, by stoping him from doing ridicilous things, protecting him from the rest of the class and stopping him while he was hurting himself.    The first opinion came up while mostly spoilers of the LN 11 existed. It manifested in the infamous ""Manami a shit""-picture, and since then people go with it.   Most of the people believing this, think of Manami as an evil supermind, which manipulates Kyousuke into doing her bidding. Most of these people forget however that she is a 14 year old schoolgirl at that point, as well as his best friend, which is underlined several times in the same novel.   She has already feelings for him at that point, most likely even far before that point. I even guess that Kirino's affection for Kyousuke started when Manami started to feel attracted to him. However, these feelings are prove that she cares for him, so she would protect him from harm.      The second one is how Kyousuke and Kirino understood her deeds. Like the other ones, LN 11 is from Kyousukes POV, and his thoughts about what happened back then is clearly shown. For him, she was there whren he needed her.  And most people say, ""That's because she wanted to turn him into her perfect husband/because she wants to hurt Kirino/because she wanted to make him into a broken weakling.""  Well, most people don't understand that the good point about Kyousuke is, that he is in fact a rather human main character, not some unbreakable hero.   But nontheless he tries hard to help those around him. Before he were ""broken"" by Manami, he was an egomaniac while putting himself under pressure to create an heroic image of himself. His chuunibyou-phase, if you want so.   The only point which really is kinda troublesome about Manami is that she is more like a parent, then like a friend to Kyousuke. A very doting parent which tries to keep him away from things which could harm him. She doesn't really trusts, or relies on him, she doesn't think that he would be able to handle stuff.   That's why there is really no situation in the whole canon in which Manami request or receives life consulation or help from Kyousuke, while the whole rest of the ""waifu""-candidates does."
Oreimo,24opl7,kiririno,2,Sun May 4 21:10:21 2014 UTC,"So, this is my take on Manami. She is not my favorite character, but I certainly don't hate her. Now, you mention she was 14 in Volume 11, but I would just like to point out that Kirino and her friends are all the same age. I will say that Kirino is much more selfish than Manami and most of the things she did were for her benefit and not Kyousuke's. You mention she is like a parent, and that is pretty accurate. She is much more of a parental figure than friend. She does try to help him out and be there for him, but she is not good at getting her feelings across. She never tries to take their relationship further, even though she wants to. There is nothing wrong with moving at your own pace, but she does not make a move until it is too late and she already lost him. While she is there for him, she does not really know the current of new him. She does not hang out with him as much as the ""Otaku Girls Unite"" group does. She is farther away from him, and sees he is changing, but does not become a part of it. She is largely a minor character and left to the side for the most part, except for the beginning and end. She plays a much larger part at the end. She just makes a lot of bad choices near the end, but she was not in a good situation to start out with."
Oreimo,24opl7,Cherry_Venus,1 point,Mon May 5 01:53:17 2014 UTC,I found it pretty ironic how Kyousuke mentioned in one of the light novels that he thought of Manami as a sister or a family member or something.

Oreimo,24lfx8,Histy,2,Sat May 3 05:48:58 2014 UTC,"Any of these trivia bits for Season 1 and Season 2. There is also a TVTropes trivia page.  In terms of hints to the second season, assuming you have already watched it and know everything that occurs, is to rewatch the interactions between Kyousuke and Manami. Occasionally, Kirino makes quips about plain girl that make more sense after knowing the complete picture. On a side note, Kyousuke's reactions to his otaku cherry being popped is pretty funny. And Kanako's change in accepting her sister's hobbies is an interesting and largely untold story."
Oreimo,24lfx8,Histy,1 point,Sat May 3 10:54:55 2014 UTC,wait.  Wat. They talk about konakos sister?
Oreimo,24lfx8,Histy,2,Sat May 3 11:29:03 2014 UTC,Subtle mention during the Saori episode to let the viewers put it together.  But Kanako goes from hating otaku to being the Meruru incarnate is positive.
Oreimo,24lfx8,mathfreak123,3,Sat May 3 12:06:11 2014 UTC,"Agreed, but i dont think she straight on-approves of it still, but is tolerant due to all the praise she gets from cosplaying Meruru"
Oreimo,24lfx8,Histy,3,Sat May 3 15:07:26 2014 UTC,Holycrap. Just finished that episode. Slightly fangirling over the end.  S.S RURI!
Oreimo,24lfx8,mathfreak123,5,Sun May 4 06:51:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah, they drop a lot of bombshells in that episode, showing how ingrained Saori is with the otaku culture there.   Kanata asks to be called ""Kanakana"", just like when Kanako asked Kyousuke to call her ""Kanakana"" (and then retracted that statement) [S1E10]. She also attempts to mention she has a little sister, but quickly gets interrupted (hinting the little sister is Kanako). It is also supported by Kanako knowing about otaku culture (such as ""yuri"" in S2E1), despite saying she hates the stuff. That and she knew the Meruru theme song pretty well. Kanata is very heavily hinted as the author of Maschera: Lament of a Fallen Beast, which is why she comments on Kuroneko's Queen of Nightmare cosplay.  She is also hinted as the author of Stardust Witch Meruru, as the design of Meruru is very similar to Kanako. This is not unusual for her as the Maschera main character Lucifer/Shinya Kurusu was based off her friend Shinya Sanada. Using Kurusu as a fictional last name implies that she used her own last name, as she did Shinya's first name.  She did remember Kirino from when they met off-screen in S1E4, when they went to meet Saori's acquaintance ""Ganma Yamanashi"", which is revealed to be one of Kanata's pen names. Kirara remembered ""Onii-chan"" Kyousuke from S1E2, because she was his maid at the Cure Maid Café, where he embarrassed himself a lot. On towards Episode 4, there is a Sword Art Online easter egg to be found.   I love rewatching this series and may have already done so more times than I can count."
Oreimo,24lfx8,Histy,2,Sun May 4 08:35:28 2014 UTC,Jebuz. My mind slowly melted from the detail in that list
Oreimo,24lfx8,mathfreak123,2,Sun May 4 08:54:54 2014 UTC,"Sorry about replying to a month-late post, but I binged the series last week. Unfortunately, when I binge, I sometimes miss out on some fun details (like the ones you mentioned). I always did find it rather interesting that ""Kanakana"" was used for both Kanata and Kanako, and I always had a feeling that she was the creator of Meruru.  Looks like I'll be re-watching the entire series again soon. Any other neat things I should look out for (hints maybe?)?"
Oreimo,24lfx8,Simplerdayz,2,Fri Jun 27 23:34:30 2014 UTC,"There are a lot of references to other shows and games, as mentioned on the TVTropes ShoutOut page for the show.  Once you learn the true antagonist of the show in the S2 OVAs, it is interesting to watch that character over the course of the two seasons and see how ingrained their subtle controlling nature is in their normal personality.  Off the top of my head, I think in the convention episode in S1, you can see the club president, as well as Kouhei/Sena in attendance if you look hard enough. There is also the whole Maschera's Lucifer/Belphegor and Kyousuke/Manami thing going on that is loosely referenced."
Oreimo,24lfx8,NotSoBluePumpkin,2,Sat Jun 28 00:21:32 2014 UTC,"Hello again. Finished watching the series over again, this time with extra attention paid to Manami (she's the true antagonist you're referencing, right?). I tried to see how her controlling nature was ingrained within her personality, but I just couldn't see it within her actions or words. I'm really interested in this, so I'll probably go read through the light novel translations to see if I can find anything. Do you have any hints or events in the plot to really look out for to see her controlling nature?"
Oreimo,24lfx8,TrustMeIGotHaki,2,Fri Jul 4 08:25:45 2014 UTC,"Yup!   Manami is always telling Kyousuke that she should come to him for advice. When you see it in Season 1, it seems completely normal, routine best friend thing to do. After the reveal in Season 2, it turns out she has been doing it pretty much the entire time, as you see Kyousuke drown in normalcy and put aside his previous energy and ambition as he grew older. But it is so normal and natural for Manami, that she probably doesn't even know herself that she is being a control freak. On second viewing, how she ""helps"" Kyousuke and the ""advice"" she gives him does seem a little more malicious than it used to be, even as genuine as her efforts are trying to be.  It is more apparent in Season 2, when she is meddling a lot harder in Kyousuke's affairs, to the point that he chooses getting advice from Kirino over Manami after his breakup. This is despite Manami telling Kyousuke to come to her about advice with Kuroneko, where she mentions hearing things around school about Kyousuke and Ruri dating and tries to pry further into Kyousuke despite him being hesitant to do so.  She also makes friends with Ayase and keeps tabs on Kyousuke and Kirino through her. In one episode, Ayase gets a rare, unexpected phone call from Manami, whose main topic is to let Ayase know that Kyousuke and Kuroneko broke up. On top of that, she is also ends up becoming Kanako's cooking teacher, who then uses her new cooking skills to try and impress Kyousuke on a few occasions. A lot more of that personality seems to shine as Kyousuke becomes more reckless and slowly stops relying on Manami's advice for everything.  But that is not to say that Manami has some two-faced evil villain persona hidden inside of her. She is a normal girl who has much of her life organized the way she wants it. She does well in school, both academically and socially as well as having an organized home life. Her family, friends and her life was going smoothly the way she wanted it to be. The Tamura household was even grooming Kyousuke to become part of the family, so there was no reason for her to complain about anything. No problems at all, she had a happy life with no adversity.  That was until Kyousuke started doing his own thing again and became less of the normal Kyousuke that she wanted him to be. She tried a lot of things in Season 2 and confessed to Kyousuke as her last hope to salvage all her attempts, ultimately to be rejected in the end.  Although that was my impression of the events that I saw in the anime only. I have not actually read the light novels themselves, but I imagine it puts a little more depth into the situation, from what I have heard about it."
Oreimo,24lfx8,TrustMeIGotHaki,2,Fri Jul 4 09:07:27 2014 UTC,"If it's like that, that's pretty subtle for me, even on a second viewing. I always interpreted how nice she was as just being a good friend, but the phone calls behind Kyousuke's back are quite sneaky now that you pointed them out.  The other character I paid extra attention to was Kirino. One particular event that was interesting was when she brought home her fake boyfriend. After Kyousuke confesses that he does not want her to have a boyfriend, Mikagami says something like, ""Your concern was correctly placed. My job here is complete; I am not really her boyfriend."" From what I can deduce, this means that Mikagami's goal was to have Kyousuke make that confession, which would imply that he has some knowledge about the details between Kirino's and Kyousuke's relationship at the time. I think this should imply that Kirino told those details to Mikagami. I find this quite strange because I would have thought Kirino would have kept as much detail about her secret feelings for Kyousuke as quiet as possible. Of course, I might be reading too much into this since all this deduction is based on the translated subtitles, and I can't understand Japanese. However, any thoughts about this?"

Her face was a bit longer in mine. Trying to remove the phone must have done something to my scale..? Dah well.  Is that the term for trying to draw an image as close to the original as possible or is it solely used in the context of actual tracing? If the second, I didn't trace it :P"
Oreimo,24dtj2,-Niernen,2,Wed Apr 30 18:40:59 2014 UTC,"That's great to do that though, you start to learn to draw real well by tracing things. I've talked to several artists who draw anime style and they all started out by tracing."

If you had rounded the eyes and mouth a bit more and moved the jaws up a tad it would be pretty close to a copy. I just noticed this, but your ears are a tad smaller and don't line up.

Oreimo,24ao20,TranClan67,7,Wed Apr 30 04:20:47 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that she would not marry Kyousuke just so Kirino would be her sister-in-law. Read the Light Novels, Ayase has a huge part in the later novels that was cut from the anime. You can clearly see why she forms feelings towards Kyousuke. She does become a more accepting person, even going out of her way to try and get Kirino an otaku gift at one point.  Even in the anime she tries to understand Kirino's hobby.   Also, Ayase initially shows interest in Kyousuke and thinks he is a nice guy, so you may want to rewatch the first season if you missed that. Or just read the Light Novels since you haven't and they are the source material (and arguably better)."
Oreimo,24ao20,-Niernen,4,Wed Apr 30 01:21:53 2014 UTC,"The answer is in the novels somewhere.  There's 12, go read them."

Oreimo,24ao20,White_sama,1 point,Tue Apr 29 22:50:57 2014 UTC,The light novels show so much more interaction with Ayase. You should check them out if you can
Oreimo,24an04,Wolflordy,3,Tue Apr 29 18:03:52 2014 UTC,"[Spoilers All]  I respect your perspective. I hope you're not thinking that you're the only one who doesn't accept Oreimo's ending, are you?  You're not alone. Fuck, the ending was so bitter in many ways. The funny thing is, it's bitter from many different angles. I have to confess, I'm not the type who has any particular best girl. And Oreimo's ending, not just from the last 3 episodes, but from S2 episode 12 where he rejects Ayase, pissed me off 1 girl at a time. A part of me wished Kyousuke ended up with Kuruneko, another part wished he ended up with Ayase, and another part wished the last episode just fucking ended with the wedding scene. No 'promise' reveal, no bullshit. Can't they just leave me happy after sticking through with them all 31 episodes? Wait, not just happy, I think SATISFIED is a much more apt word.   God, that feeling when you saw the promise reveal and that last Akihabara scene. One part of me just goes, ""aww, what the hell, really? they can't? aww, but the kiss on the cheek. eh? so that means... UGH. WHAT THE FUCK. IT'S OKAY. I THINK THIS ENDING IS OKAY. BUT UGH. WHAT'S THIS TWISTED FEELING.""  I don't know who you're referring to with 'your' in 'your reality', but if you're directing it to the general Oreimo community, hell, I don't think most of us truly accept that the anime ending episodes as canon too. After facing the reality that is Oreimo's given ending, some us just turn a blind eye on what we're given. We dig up Doujinshis to see Kyousuke with ___________, we look at Fanart, we play/watch the VNs, read the Light Novels (cover up the missing arcs the anime left out)Refer to EDIT. Maybe watch Yosuga no Sora to fulfill your inner wincest tendencies, complement it with a dose of KissxSis if you really want a shot of incestual fantasy scenarios. We try to fill in the emptiness we have, an emptiness honestly I don't think any other anime has punched into me before.  If by 'your' you mean the author, the publishers, or whoever is in charge of letting the story play out as it was. Go ahead. I'd be pretty pissed off at them as well. Although, it can't be helped can it. Maybe it's because it's taboo and all.  TLDR It's good and perfectly alright if you don't accept the last 3 episodes (or even including the episode before) as canon. You're not alone. I just hope that for the past 2 months you've been filling up that emptiness the rejection of the anime ending has carved out of you :)  EDIT: /u/Dintwo raises an interesting point about reading the LNs.. However, I don't think it's wrong to involve yourself in delusional shipping, it's simply a guilty pleasure and a visit to ""what if's"" just as /u/KokoLokoKoko and /u/-Niernen has mentioned. But /u/Dintwo is right about the subreddit needing people to read the Light Novels if they truly want to discuss (or complain) about the characters/arcs in Oreimo. /r/Oreimo is sorely lacking in Light Novel Discussion. Shall we start one soon?"
Oreimo,24an04,Woowoo_Water,5,Tue Apr 29 18:39:39 2014 UTC,What are you saying? The anime ended at the marriage scene when they kissed...  Were you on drugs when you watched it?
Oreimo,24an04,White_sama,1 point,Tue Apr 29 18:58:25 2014 UTC,"Hm? Oh yeah, I think I mistook an earlier Akihabara scene and placed it behind the marriage scene. Hm, how the hell could I have recalled it like that? Silly memory of mine.  EDIT: A /s is warranted."

Oreimo,24an04,Woowoo_Water,3,Tue Apr 29 19:03:17 2014 UTC,"This attitude that people would rather well up in depression/anger or substitute their own headcanon before actually attempting to understand Oreimo is why this subreddit is incapable of any decent discussion about the series.   You should be turning to the LNs to understand, but instead we have people encouraging others to play the shallow, pandering VNs that disregard the character's development and traits and often weren't even written by the author.  If people like the series I wish they'd read the LNs and encourage others to do the same. Currently the trend seems to be telling people to delve further into their delusional shipping, and what results is zero actual discussion except getting upset about misconceptions and talking about what characters you like masturbating to.  There is a good romance in Oreimo. It may not have included your favorite girl but you're not Kyousuke. The ""incest wasn't allowed"" excuse explaining away the ending is overrepresented and completely unnecessary if people would actually attempt to understand the themes carried throughout the story and importance of the epilogue chapter."

Oreimo,24an04,KokoLokoKoko,1 point,Wed Apr 30 00:18:45 2014 UTC,"I look more at the VN as the ""what if's"", and how characters would behave in different situations in the future. There are some common things, like Kirino becoming a professional model and traveling (to Europe?) that could probably happen.   But I do agree that people should read the LN. Honestly, while the anime was enjoyable, it did a bad job adapting the source material. They change characters and situations and skip some very important character development near the end. Cutting out parts of volumes 9-12 was a bad idea imo."

Implying they run away, what are they goin to do? they are young, they dont have a job, a career or a house, I think about that time kirino is 15 and kyousuke 18 isnt? well you get the idea, they are still in love, but if they want to live together they have to be at least economy independent. anyway, maybe you know this alredy but a lot of people who are blinded by the rage of this ending dont know it."

Lets forget the fact that they would leave all their friends and family behind, they wouldn't be able to make money. Kyousuke wouldn't have a college degree, so his jobs would be limited. Kirino could not model or become an athlete because that would expose them to the public. And Kirino obviously did not save much of her modeling money, so unless she sells her collection they don't have much to live on. And if the people at the place found out they were siblings that eloped, I don't think they would be too accepting."

Oreimo,24an04,KokoLokoKoko,1 point,Wed Apr 30 00:52:33 2014 UTC,"He stated that on interviews. Not going to look them up, but you can if you so choose.   And he wouldn't be labeled a psyco as much as not published. You seem to be missing the fact that all the author does is write the story. He does not distribute it, the publisher does. If the publisher tells and author to do something, they do, otherwise their book won't be published. Even if he had gone full incest, the book would have never made it to the public, so it really wouldn't change much. He ended it the best way he thought he could. And he could not piss off the publishers because he already had another series lined up."
Oreimo,24an04,-Niernen,2,Wed Apr 30 00:34:35 2014 UTC,"I knew that, but since he said after the book's publication that he wanted the full Kirino route, his publisher must have given him some trouble"

Oreimo,247b1b,BuildBruh,2,Mon Apr 28 18:03:33 2014 UTC,"This particular scene, coupled with the events in Episode 3, were things that really sold me on the show when I first saw it. After seeing everything they went through and getting an idea of how their lives were before the show even began, I knew the Kousaka siblings' rekindling adventure was going to be something special. And I couldn't even imagine how that turned out.  It was also this scene that made me realize that most of Kirino's actions were justifiable and the realization that a lot of the underlying issues had a lot to do with Kyousuke, whether he realized it or not (possibly because everything became normal to him; his distance from his sister became a routine thing). And Kirino would subtlety play the blame game every so often and it flew under the radar until the second season."

Oreimo,247b1b,Histy,1 point,Mon Apr 28 19:23:36 2014 UTC,Which episode is this?
Oreimo,247b1b,megustafap,5,Tue Apr 29 10:58:31 2014 UTC,"11 minutes into Season 1, Episode 5, as Kyousuke and Kirino get into a heated argument.  It is also one of the early moments we get a subtle clue about the issues surrounding Kirino, interestingly enough."
Oreimo,246blf,Deepified,12,Mon Apr 28 10:01:35 2014 UTC,"First things first.   Gokou Ruri is best girl.   Welcome aboard on the glorious S.S.Kuroneko that sails for eternity to serve our one and only Kuroneko.  Now back to the topic, I do agree with most points and I actually really like the idea of kiss-on-the-cheeks meaning a farewell, never thought of it that way before but after reading, I can see how that works out. Something to think about though, is that even though Otaku circle is indeed unbroken, I don't know if the relationship between each other will exactly be the same as well. Who knows, the author rushed the ending and we will never know now unless a miracle happens and author decides to somehow continue an already ended story."
Oreimo,246blf,DJLTheFirst,3,Mon Apr 28 12:24:40 2014 UTC,"I think the previous two comments is enough to get you covered.   I don't find the ending frustrating, other romcom endings have frustrated me much worse than Oreimo's. Rather, I guess it's evoke a bittersweet feeling for me. Up to you to feel optimistic or pessimistic towards the ending I suppose.  Enjoy post Anime-Oreimo with the LNs, read the Doujinshi's - both H and non-H, watch the translated VNs. The Doujinshi's helped me cope with Kyousukes relationships in general, particularly Kirino's ending (there's one in particular some of us consider canon, Hoshikuzu Namida was it?) and Kuruneko's ending. Ayase's PSP VN route helped me cope with her rejection."
Oreimo,246blf,Woowoo_Water,2,Mon Apr 28 12:33:42 2014 UTC,"I was planning on playing the PSP game so I could feel better about Kuroneko's rejection, but it turns out the translation is nowhere near done. It's following the same fate as Hollow Ataraxia at this point.  The anime failed to make Ayase likable in my opinion, a sudden transformation within the final 5 episodes weren't enough, although I can tell there is something to like about her if I delve deeper into the LN's."
Oreimo,246blf,Adept94,1 point,Mon Apr 28 13:41:12 2014 UTC,"Go to Youtube, get some Ziddy. Makes people warm and fuzzy in their Hearts. It's the reason why I like Oreimo this much: The amount of content is incredible and still stays interesting."
Oreimo,246blf,LanceSandrson,1 point,Mon Apr 28 13:43:51 2014 UTC,"I'm late in posting this since I just finished myself. I would have enjoyed the ending a lot more, if they didn't make Kyousuke and Kuroneko such a good couple, then go and ruin it.."
Oreimo,246blf,Adept94,3,Mon May 5 20:54:52 2014 UTC,"I have to agree at some points. The anime really left out very much, and the end is also not really perfect, even though that's no ""farewell""-kiss. In the LNs it's a kiss on the mouth, rather than one on the cheek.  Also it's known that this last scene was only added so the novel could get published. So the lonely marriage is the last scene which was intended.  And Manami is more right than you think. Even though Kyousuke still seems to have most of the girls still hanging around him, there is a difference now. Kuroneko is the best example. Their last scene together is the drive in the car, and their relationship surely became a lot worse.  I'm not really concerned about their relationships with Kanako and Ayase however. I don't think they would really turn their backs to Kirino, and Kyousuke is still someone which both want to rely on, at least that would be my guess.  The biggest problem comes up with Manami, because she and Kyousuke have to practically rebuild their whole relationship, since the old way won't work anymore. And the relationship between Manami and Kirino stays unresolved, since in LN 11 they seem to be friendly to each other, however in LN 12 it's again different. Also it's said that they had a sibling-like relationship once, in LN 11. It's actually the most interesting connection in the whole canon, since their interaction until now always have been bound to Kyousuke. And he was the reason why the relationship between them went downhill.  And what Manami said also isn't wrong. The moment their relationship is uncovered, they are both heavily screwed. Their family would be against it, Ayase and Kanako, maybe even Saori would have to make a certain distance to them, since they are all three are somehow bound to society.   I still say it's an fitting somehow-end. It fits, i mean, look at the title, however it's not really an end. And that's because of all the unsolved problems the novel ends with. It's like the author didn't wanted to write the parts which would actually be very difficult to write."
Oreimo,246blf,DinTwo,1 point,Mon Apr 28 11:55:22 2014 UTC,"It's like the author didn't wanted to write the parts which would actually be very difficult to write.   At the end of the day, Oreimo has always been a light-hearted romance series. It was never the intention of the story to explore the difficulties of incest and for it to suddenly change direction and do so twelve volumes in would be inappropriate.   You're both right and wrong when you say it's not really an end. It's not an end because the story of Kirino and Kyousuke facing the challenges their love may bring is just beginning. It is, however, the end of the story about their growing closer, reconciling, and falling in love. Those were always the main points of the series and they were properly concluded by the end of the story.  It's kind of a vulnerability of all romance stories, that the story must end somewhere. We can't follow the couple until death even though relationships always lead to some matter of conflict. The reader is left knowing the couple is in love and has to assume they'll be able to handle the challenges they face. Oreimo does just that, and also refers to life counseling as it has been thoroughly explored so we can guess how things might play out.   Honestly, with the way things are structured I think you could essentially take the first three chapters, replace 'eroge' with 'incest' and the scenes would play out the same. With how weird Daisuke behaves near the end and in extras, and how accepting Ayase has become, we'd probably see the same progression with incest as we did with eroge."
Oreimo,246blf,DizzyZiddy,1 point,Mon Apr 28 12:33:17 2014 UTC,"Also it's known that this last scene was only added so the novel could get published. So the lonely marriage is the last scene which was intended.   So this is what people have been saying when the author had to change the incest relationship to bypass censorship? If so, that would make a lot more sense.  Regarding Manami: She is right. She is absolutely right, but she is the reason the entire Kirino-Kyousuke relationship became the way it is as well. She's caused Kirino to develop a complex, and she's forced Kyousuke to stay as someone that accords to HER tastes, and as someone so average and shut-in that she eliminates all competition. She also caused the two to stay apart, therefore making the developed instinct of ""DON'T FUCK YOUR SISTER"" not apply to the two. Her being right does not make her any worse a girl than she already is. Not to mention her attachment to Kyousuke is even crazier than Ayase's to Kirino."

Oreimo,246blf,calvcoll,1 point,Tue Apr 29 14:12:54 2014 UTC,"I like your opinions and agree with most of them. Also the author intended for the epilogue kiss to be on the lips.  You'll enjoy the LNs if you get around to reading them, and you really should, because you're on the right track with a lot of things that are more fleshed out in the novels.   edit: Another thing that's kind of a big deal; The subs screwed up the translation in the final scene. The subs say ""talk when we get home"" while Kirino actually says something along the lines of ""we're doing life counseling when we get home"". I'm sure you'll agree that there's some implications that accompany life counseling that ""talk"" doesn't encapsulate."

Oreimo,23lkk8,sirbob6,7,Mon Apr 21 16:11:36 2014 UTC,Relevant fanart.   Edit: And I found Kirino's NTR.
Oreimo,23lkk8,kiririno,2,Mon Apr 21 19:34:03 2014 UTC,"Oh my gosh that's brilliant.  Seriously two of my three favorite animes all time (yes, let the incest jokes begin)."
Oreimo,23lkk8,fatblackninja,4,Mon Apr 21 19:42:37 2014 UTC,Is the third one Koi Kaze?
Oreimo,23lkk8,konohasaiyajin,4,Mon Apr 21 19:58:22 2014 UTC,"That's a safe guess, but it's actually Seitokai Yakuindomo."
Oreimo,23lkk8,fatblackninja,3,Mon Apr 21 20:00:47 2014 UTC,"Don't worry, I'm right there with you.   Needless to say, last arc of Yosuga no Sora is best arc."
Oreimo,23lkk8,-Niernen,5,Tue Apr 22 00:29:44 2014 UTC,"Thank you! Gray hair = best hair for many animes. Yosuga no Sora, Oreshura..... hell even Nakaimo if we're being honest."

Oreimo,23lkk8,-Niernen,2,Tue Apr 22 03:45:48 2014 UTC,"Gentlemen, let's not forget about Sakagami Tomoyo from Clannad"
Oreimo,23muld,EvilTorchic,7,Mon Apr 21 23:48:23 2014 UTC,She acts spoiled and doesn't seem to respect or appreciate her brother at all. Or some people just hate incest.
Oreimo,23muld,Cherry_Venus,3,Tue Apr 22 00:17:24 2014 UTC,"She doesn't act spoiled, she is spoiled. Her whole family and all of her friends spoil her. She doesn't respect Kyouske openly, which is what causes problems. If she actually admitted her feelings instead of being all Tsun she would be a much nicer character."
Oreimo,23muld,-Niernen,10,Tue Apr 22 01:35:55 2014 UTC,B-but thats what makes her appealing later on :D
Oreimo,23muld,BuildBruh,3,Tue Apr 22 02:22:01 2014 UTC,"Lets be honest, most people would not put up with half her shit if they didn't have to, especially if they knew nothing would come from it."
Oreimo,23muld,-Niernen,3,Tue Apr 22 02:24:01 2014 UTC,"Potential backing [DESTROYED]  Welp, lost any and all backing i could've had."
Oreimo,23muld,BuildBruh,2,Tue Apr 22 02:25:28 2014 UTC,I'm sorry. I guess masochists should be excluded.
Oreimo,23muld,-Niernen,2,Tue Apr 22 02:30:09 2014 UTC,"Heh, Would it be masochistic if said person were to deal with her purely because they like her that much?  -Not 100% sure what would qualify on masochistic so trying to create a cleaner definition for myself-"
Oreimo,23muld,BuildBruh,2,Tue Apr 22 02:32:57 2014 UTC,"Masochists enjoy pain/humiliation. Kirino will only give you pain and humiliation. She rarely is kind or loving initially, and it takes a hell of work to get her to acknowledge you. Not to mention she avoids and shuns the guys her age. How would anyone truly get to know her or like her if all they saw was that. You have to realize we see Kirino from Kyousuke's eyes, she is much worse personality wise towards others. No other boy would get near her. Unless you were related to the modeling/fashion industry you could not get close to her or know her. She would shun other otaku too, even though they have simialr interests."
Oreimo,23muld,-Niernen,2,Tue Apr 22 02:43:18 2014 UTC,"About that last sentence, i don' think she really shuns them, just tries to cover up that she's an otaku too. Not sure what episode, but when they run into ayase at comiket (think thats what it was), she immediatly throws the 'otaku' spotlight on saori and kuroneko just to distract ayase from the fact/possibility that she could be an otaku too. I think selfishness would be a decent backing for that, but at the same time as a model, popular girl, etc. I think just about anyone would throw someone underthe bus like that to prevent turning from one of the most popular people to the least popular in a matter of a day or two."
Oreimo,23muld,BuildBruh,3,Tue Apr 22 02:47:25 2014 UTC,"I know referring to the LNs sounds like a broken record to a lot of you but in passing I'd like to point out that in that scene Kirino is never actually says anything when asked if she knows Kuroneko and Saori. She's speechless and Kyousuke saves her.  It's both funny and depressing how many of these tiny altercations between the two mediums end up being constantly mentioned as defining actions of Kirino. Stupid stuff like making her kick him in the balls instead of the stomach, making her throw a piece of cake with a plate instead of just a piece of cake, turning a friendly nod into a scoff, etc."
Oreimo,23muld,DinTwo,0,Tue Apr 22 03:02:44 2014 UTC,"What the hell are you talking about? The only people Kirino treats poorly initially are Kyousuke and Manami. Nowhere in the story does it say anything about her shunning or avoiding other guys or people her age. In fact, it says the exact opposite, as Ayase says Kirino is very friendly at school, she's nice to Akagi and Mikagami and pretty much anyone else unfamiliar she encounters. The only time anything you're saying could be implied is when Ayase says Kirino told her she'd only date someone older than her.   Yes, it's probably intimidating to approach her for boys her age but she would not treat them the way she treats Kyousuke at the beginning of the series, much less worse. She treats Kyousuke the way she does for a multitude of different reasons related to their history and her feelings.    Let me remind you that it was Ayase that scolded the otakus in the class, while Kirino was interested in what they were talking about."
Oreimo,23muld,DinTwo,1 point,Tue Apr 22 02:50:18 2014 UTC,"Let me remind you that it was Ayase that scolded the otakus in the class, while Kirino was interested in what they were talking about.   Interested in what they are talking about and interested in them as people are two very, very different things. Do you honestly think she would approach them? They probably would never approach her either, she has her image and that does not include being an otaku. Anyone that would have similar interests would be put off by her public image and friends. Not to mention she would most likely reject them on the spot (Depending on your views, she may himulitate them or start praising herself as too good for them). And lets not mention the ones that say she is friendly don't know too much about her when they say that.   Mikagami   Fashion industry   Akagi   Don't really remember them interacting much. (unless you mean Sena, which would be different).   And most of the boys in the series are older than her, so she would ahve to show them some respect in public."
Oreimo,23muld,-Niernen,1 point,Tue Apr 22 03:00:58 2014 UTC,Yeah I think most people don't like her because she doesn't outwardly portray her emotions. The tsun characteristics make her seem arrogant and spoiled a little.
Oreimo,23muld,KokoLokoKoko,8,Tue Apr 22 01:59:23 2014 UTC,but...incest is wincest
Oreimo,23muld,-Niernen,1 point,Tue Apr 22 02:25:54 2014 UTC,Until the police lock them up in prison and they never get to see each other again...
Oreimo,23muld,DinTwo,5,Wed Apr 23 00:23:13 2014 UTC,"Kuroneko is an easily accessible character and her emotions and intentions are immediately obvious. You can figure out her character by reading a chapter.   Kirino's complexities are withheld by design and change throughout the story. You need to read through the whole story and then reflect to figure out just what she's thinking or feeling at any given point in the story. It was the intention of the author for the reader to feel confused and frustrated with Kirino's behavior at the beginning, just as Kyousuke is. The story is written so you hate Kirino at the beginning just as Kyousuke did. As Kyousuke comes to understand her better, so does the reader.   This becomes a huge problem in the adaptation, because the story being told from Kyousuke's perspective is no longer central to the plot. What happens instead is people write Kirino off immediately while watching the anime and find some other character to be distracted by, often one who is easier to digest. Having already made up their mind, they don't look for growth in Kirino's character or behavior and instead look for more reasons to despise her. This trend is so prominent that even the anime staff seems to be guilty of it.   Thus, we see many anime fans who love side-character X and hate Kirino, and their only reason for hating Kirino is something petty that pushed them over the edge in season 1, ie the 'bitchiness' or 'violence' that isn't even present in the second half of the series and wasn't nearly as prominent in the source material."
Oreimo,23muld,-Niernen,3,Tue Apr 22 02:30:11 2014 UTC,"That makes sense. For me I didn't mind her character at first, and as the story progressed I liked her more and more, and didn't get all the hate for her."
Oreimo,23muld,-Niernen,1 point,Tue Apr 22 02:48:57 2014 UTC,"Yes, the anime does not to a great job of adapting the true characters. I  was rereading a part from the first novel and it stuck me how much the all had changed by the end of the series, but you don't get that as much from the anime, mostly because they cut off a lot of character development and internal monologues."
Oreimo,23muld,Lrdwhyt,2,Wed Apr 23 00:25:32 2014 UTC,"Well, for most of the early series she does act like a bitch and treat Kyouske like shit publicly. If she was more dere and not violent tsun people may like her better. And while Kuroneko may make some snide comments, she has a generally nicer personality (not to mention she is not violent).   Also, Kyouske could have actually stayed with Kuroneko and had a long-term relationship with her, which was not possible with Kirino. They could have gone much further than Kirino could have. Some people are mad Kirino ""stole"" Kyouske from Kuroneko."
Oreimo,23muld,-Niernen,2,Tue Apr 22 00:21:27 2014 UTC,which was not possible with Kirino.   Is so.
Oreimo,23muld,Lrdwhyt,2,Tue Apr 22 22:08:50 2014 UTC,Did you not watch the ending or are you ignoring it?
Oreimo,23muld,-Niernen,3,Tue Apr 22 22:18:01 2014 UTC,"Neither. The ending is left ""open"" in that the two are certainly capable of continuing their romantic relationship. The author hints at this when Kyousuke kisses Kirino in Akihabara in the epilogue."
Oreimo,23muld,Lrdwhyt,2,Tue Apr 22 22:53:58 2014 UTC,"Yes, but obviously not a public relationship. Something further than what they had would obviously be taboo and hidden, they can't really get married."
Oreimo,23muld,-Niernen,2,Tue Apr 22 23:13:38 2014 UTC,"I'm replying specifically to ""long-term relationship ... not possible with Kirino"", which is not true. A long-term relationship was definitely possible."
Oreimo,23muld,Lrdwhyt,2,Tue Apr 22 23:30:47 2014 UTC,Not with Kyousuke. It just won't happen.
Oreimo,23muld,-Niernen,3,Tue Apr 22 23:41:10 2014 UTC,"It will happen. Have you read the light novels? The anime does it to a lesser degree, but in the light novels there's definitely the implication that their (romantic) relationship will continue."
Oreimo,23muld,Lrdwhyt,2,Wed Apr 23 00:02:24 2014 UTC,"I have read every thing translated on BakaTsuki. While they still have feelings for each other and it is implied they will have a secret relationship, it is nothing lifelong. Kyousuke is going to university, and Kirino's modeling career will probably take her around the world. They won't have as much time together. Not to mention they both know they can't actually get married or cross the line (like having kids). Long term is not something like a few months, I'm talking about the rest of their life. No matter how much they love each other, they know they can not get married or have a long term relationship. Besides the fact that its a huge social taboo and they would be shunned, it is also illegal. Contrary to what doujins may say, they probably won't take it that far. So while the ending is open and does implicate things, it does not mean they have have a long term relationship. Kyouske could have had a long term relationship with Ruri. She understood him and Kirino, and was actually legal."

Oreimo,236epz,Woowoo_Water,1 point,Thu Apr 17 05:28:50 2014 UTC,plus 1 Nisekoi. I am loving this show. It's so good.
Oreimo,236epz,Woowoo_Water,4,Thu Apr 17 04:19:35 2014 UTC,"After Oreimo, I've watched Yosuga no Sora, NouKome/NouCome (aka Ore no Nōnai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Rabu Kome o Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru).   And I've just discovered Kiss x Sis. To think I thought I was depraved enough watching Yosuga no Sora, the lewdness of Kiss x Sis (the OVAs specifically) is amazing. It's pretty much clothed non-penetration incestual softcore porn. Surprising how I felt more morally depraved watching Kiss x Sis than in Yosuga no Sora even though the latter went full on ecchi and borderline hentai.  Too bad none of them neither YnS nor KxS  beat Oreimo in having actual blood related siblings, then again, I know about productions having no choice but to conform with the taboo in Japan."
Oreimo,236epz,hateyoualways,3,Wed Apr 16 16:26:25 2014 UTC,"In Yosuga no Sora, they are blood related siblings, identical twins at that."
Oreimo,236epz,BuildBruh,4,Wed Apr 16 19:24:26 2014 UTC,Twincest
Oreimo,236epz,Woowoo_Water,6,Thu Apr 17 00:01:41 2014 UTC,Twincest arc best arc.
Oreimo,236epz,BuildBruh,2,Thu Apr 17 04:16:11 2014 UTC,"WOW, TWINCEST? I am watching this shit."
Oreimo,236epz,Woowoo_Water,2,Thu Apr 17 05:29:33 2014 UTC,"Heh, well, I would recommend you watch the entire series instead of just the incest arc, because the format of the episodes is kinda unique. Somewhat like a eroge, there are different routes the MC takes. Although I gotta admit, the characters are kinda generic but the ecchi kept me going, with the twincest arc to reward me at the end. :P  I can guarantee you won't feel empty after watching this anime unlike after Oreimo's ending."
Oreimo,236epz,BuildBruh,2,Thu Apr 17 05:46:38 2014 UTC,I will definitely watch the whole thing ;)
Oreimo,236epz,Woowoo_Water,2,Thu Apr 17 07:08:12 2014 UTC,They're fraternal twins.
Oreimo,236epz,ScarletITears,2,Thu Apr 17 01:28:20 2014 UTC,"The Kiss X sis manga is as close as you can get to hentai. 77 (IIRC), chapters, more ecchi than highscool DXD and supersedes Yosuga No Sora by far."
Oreimo,236epz,kiririno,1 point,Thu Apr 17 01:33:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah. Anyways, do the siblings ever do actual penetration? I checked online, people said they never ever gotten close to it."

Oreimo,236epz,White_sama,2,Sat Apr 26 14:43:31 2014 UTC,"Haha. I've yet to complete the series. The incestual ecchi, though non-nude, is surprisingly too high on the moral depravity scale for me :P  Like porn, after I watch one episode, I really can't stand myself watching another. Because watching just one episode is already more than enough, an incestual fantasy come true you can say XD."
Oreimo,236epz,kiririno,1 point,Sat Apr 26 15:50:06 2014 UTC,I agree. After one episode I can't watch another. It's really freaking amazing.  Do you have any other that I should know?

Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei looks fun time anime, hopefully on par with Guilty Crown but I highly doubt they will go for that serious tone, which is cool too, younger sister love is the best love. Date a Live 2 because Origami is best girl. Ok Tohka has her moments, but hell Origami had me at assertive alpha female. Idk about anyone else, but Black Cat is worth a watch if you haven't seen it before and are looking for something old school and good. Kinda felt like watching Cowboy Bebop for the first time. spoiler ultra rage ahead, FUCK THAT SHIT INORI SHOULD HAVE LIVED WITH SHU WTF BRO. or just kill em both. i miss you my waifu."

I'm on to Episode 6 now, plan on binging it till the end. :)  Plus there's at least one doujinshi available to satisfy my cravings for---- , which is good enough for me already."

Oreimo,22yzst,megustafap,1 point,Tue Apr 15 10:56:43 2014 UTC,what is Barbie-bodies? Can you give me examples of ecchi that does not have barbie bodies?
Oreimo,22yzst,KumoNoAima,2,Wed Apr 16 12:54:54 2014 UTC,"No nipples (and nothing down there either, but I think that's a given, since I don't think you can show uncensored full frontal nudity in Japan). You can see it in the images I posted: here and here (NSFW obviously). I think it actually looks a bit creepy.  It seems that these Barbie-bodies are a recent thing and you don't usually see it in older ecchi. For example, I'm currently watching Ladies versus Butlers! and the uncensored version has normal boobs with nipples and not these creepy Barbie-boobs."
Oreimo,22yzst,megustafap,1 point,Wed Apr 16 16:51:11 2014 UTC,"I see, thanks for the clarification. I swear I've seen some recent anime that has nipples in it, but I forget which one.   I agree it's a bit creepy. But I still enjoy it."

Oreimo,22yzst,KumoNoAima,2,Mon Apr 14 04:04:49 2014 UTC,"There are some better moments scattered here and there in the anime, but mostly it's just generic ecchi mush (which isn't necessarily bad if you like ecchi, but even in that case it's better to wait for the BDs since the TV version was pretty heavily censored).  There's some interesting development between the onii-chan and the imouto, but unfortunately even that doesn't get very far and the ending is very inconclusive. Maybe if this received a second season that wrapped up things more it would be worth it, but as it is I don't really see much reason to pick this over any other ecchi show (except for the whole onii-chan/imouto thing, which is why I watched it ;)."
Oreimo,22yzst,TY3000,1 point,Mon Apr 14 10:53:38 2014 UTC,"I actually haven't watched much of it and have heard the same things as you. Based on the first 2 episodes, it feels like all of the humor is based around ""needing to pee but being unable to take off her chastity belt"". Personally, I would say, no. I was hoping that op could review more about the show."
Oreimo,22yzst,utrocker,3,Mon Apr 14 04:09:23 2014 UTC,"It was an interesting show. I watched it weekly. I didn't hate it but it wasn't magnificent. It seemed that the later episodes added conflict that the next episode either forgot happened or decided to just suppress the new conflicts. I still have no clue. It tried to be a harem for about an episode.   All in all I have no clue what most of the point of the episodes were. I also have no clue why I enjoyed it. Maybe just for what I hoped the ending would be? No clue. If you're looking for something like Oreimo, it's very much not. Probably most people wouldn't like it at all. My two cents."
Oreimo,22yzst,Lrdwhyt,1 point,Mon Apr 14 05:02:10 2014 UTC,How does it do in the romance department? Is there romance between the siblings/is it any good?

Oreimo,22yzst,UnorthodoxByNature,2,Mon Apr 14 05:15:50 2014 UTC,"There is very minimal, if any, romance progression between the siblings. There are some instances where it seems like it might but, nothing really comes out of it. By the end, only their bond as siblings is truly progressed. Of course, that could also be a sign of romantic progression depending on how you interpret it. I really enjoyed it though and I look forward to another season if it were to happen."
Oreimo,22yzst,utrocker,2,Mon Apr 14 10:50:57 2014 UTC,"There is no romance. It's ecchi and humor. That's really all. It's one of those things where you may be wanting romantic scenes but then it goes, ""lol nah"" and you're left there at the end of the episode."

Oreimo,22lgpd,BuildBruh,2,Wed Apr 9 15:22:03 2014 UTC,"Well, don't force yourself.  Many creative people needs a muse. You should find what inspires you, that will be your muse. Then it is effortless to write.  I am inspired by mature themes and tragedy, so the kuroneko event was the perfect storm, so to speak."
Oreimo,22lgpd,Woowoo_Water,2,Wed Apr 9 15:46:30 2014 UTC,"Videogames.anime.fanfic.anything i like. My muse... IT'S ALL MINE.  Great fanfic, and an fanficauthor to another, how do you write such long stories ;-;. My longest is only 1000 or so words long, still finishing it but lost almost all passion for it. I feel more at ease writing extremely well detailed fanfics, but those never break 500 words.... ;-;"
Oreimo,22lgpd,BuildBruh,1 point,Fri Apr 11 01:22:09 2014 UTC,"I'll give you some advice how I do it then... mind you, there are different ways to write, and some people just make it up as they go, others make a raw outline of the story and then fill things in.  I write in two stages.. first I daydream and make up scenarios that doesn't really fit together, and try to puzzle them to some kind of story. Sometimes they fit, but you have to discard some of course.  Then a raw outline will form in your mind, some big events. The start and end of the story. For example, in my story the beginning was that the characters would meet and the end that they would reconcile.  Then you can begin to fill in the blanks between the events. So you go from very broad strokes to detail.  Then there's crazy people like the author of game of thrones who just makes stuff up as he goes, and it turns out very good anyway."
Oreimo,22lgpd,BuildBruh,3,Fri Apr 11 05:45:48 2014 UTC,"Thanks, that was a nice read. Although I felt slighlty conflicted at how Kyousuke resolved everything believing everything would fall apart if he chose Kirino.   I guess it's because I'm too used to seeing a Kirino-route Kyousuke from the anime and the LN, that I go:   ""Wha- Is this the Kyousuke I know? I thought he's the guy who proclaim that he doesn't care about the consequences of being lovers with his little sister.""  Then again, if I read your fanfic pretending I have no knowledge how Kyousuke argued with Manami over his forbidden sister love, I'd then feel the way the fan fic plays out as plausible.  If you're wondering anyways, yeah, your fanfic cured my Kuroneko depression :) just as how the PSP Ayase route cured my Ayase depression.  EDIT: After re-reading Volume 12 LN, damn, now I believe Kyousuke's dad going suicidal as a possibility.   To all those anime-centric Oreimo followers, go read the LN's. SO. MUCH. PLOT. (Especially Volume 9. Different POVs, YAY.)"
Oreimo,22lgpd,Woowoo_Water,2,Wed Apr 9 17:17:33 2014 UTC,"Will have to check out the PSP one. Heard the Kanako and Ayase route are really good there.  Incest is still a very difficult concept today in western society, and especially in the japanese society Kyousuke lives in. It's a terrible thing, almost seen as inhuman. Probably, it was exaggerated, but maybe not. But things can change, and destiny is never set in stone."
Oreimo,22lgpd,BuildBruh,1 point,Wed Apr 9 18:18:40 2014 UTC,"I love oreimo, but hate it at the same time. It shows the light and darkness of being an otaku, but doesnt do the consequences of incest a justice in anyway."
Oreimo,22lgpd,Woowoo_Water,2,Fri Apr 11 01:17:45 2014 UTC,"Indeed. It was a bad incest story, and after the Kuroneko event it just fell apart. I know a lot of people disagree. But when you've seen good incest like Yosuga no Sora then Oreimo doesn't hold up at all."
Oreimo,22lgpd,BuildBruh,3,Fri Apr 11 05:48:03 2014 UTC,highfive yosuga no sora is the only reason why i got into anime.
Oreimo,22lgpd,NotSoBluePumpkin,2,Fri Apr 11 06:18:05 2014 UTC,"Oh, that's interesting. I guess I'll try to watch it again then.   I didn't get past the halfway mark of the 1st episode of YnS because I felt it was kinda dark and mellow. I have to agree that Oreimo doesn't really do incest consequences much justice, but the romantic-comedy aspect kept me going. I know Yosuga No Sora has harem, but is there romantic-comedy aspect? Or more towards normal romance? I might give it another shot."
Oreimo,22lgpd,Woowoo_Water,1 point,Fri Apr 11 15:18:23 2014 UTC,"The first few episodes are rough in that sense. Later on tho, the mood really lightens due to who he loves, i mean fucks.  Edit: its kinda romantic dramaesk feel to the series. I think the games are much more comedic, tho it may be because the 2nd game was fanmade."

[Edit] I went through the reasons in a different thread but I thought I should leave it here as well.   No Full Voice Acting    This PS3 game contains lesser voice data compared to Oreimo PSP and Tsuzuku separately, I got my tech team to take a look at it.  Anything that isn't ""story-related"" in the game is unvoiced, pre-event scenes are unvoiced as well.   Limited CGs   Again, this PS3 game has lesser CG data than the portable games.   Bad 3D Models   Compare this game to Idolmaster's 3d models. Even Dream Club is fine.   Idol game but it's actually just a Photo-taking game with Oreimo.    Idolmaster makes a cameo in the opening scene as well, but they fail to take anything that is remotely fun about that over to this game. Photo Taking is extremely limited as well, with limited poses that all the characters share.  I don't understand the point system for the Photos as well, but at least the game has a point display skill that you can unlock. (Something that looks nice to you can be judged as very bad in the game)  Want to play a good photo taking game? Check out Motto SoniComi.   Only one Save Slot   Extremely annoying because the game will block your progress and you will end up restarting the game without knowing why it happened.  A strategy guide is essential to this game if you don't want to get annoyed by it.   Long Load Times   Game could've gave an option for you to install the game to speed up the loading, but wasn't offered."

Someone is bound to have posted it up on YouTube already, with English translations already up, in fact, I think I came across it through this subreddit at least once. I would recommend that over playing it without really being able to follow Japanese.  gl though if you do go for it, if it ends up being a fun experience, then you got the intented purpose! :D"
Oreimo,21vrdd,Rainbow_Cast,3,Tue Apr 1 01:21:55 2014 UTC,"Assuming you're not in Japan, if you live somewhere with any kind of ""little Tokyo"", or otherwise significant Japanese population, hit up the area and look for bookstores. Kinokuniya and Book-OFF are the most common, but any bookstore that sells Japanese novels will likely have something. If not, you can always ask the staff if they can import it for you.  If you don't live near any, you may try other Asian areas that might otherwise cater to the demographic (Chinatowns, Little Koreas, etc.) They may have the book translated into another language, though (Chinese, Korean,...)  If that fails, consider buying them when you go on a trip somewhere that has said stores.  Otherwise, you'll have to import them yourself/buy them online. Try to buy from a store that charges shipping by volume rather than weight, as 12 volumes of books will likely weight a bit, and you'll be footing quite a bill for the shipping."
Oreimo,21vrdd,onigkkwgn,2,Tue Apr 1 02:27:50 2014 UTC,"I don't know any good importing sites, you may want to try some anime merch sub ans see if they can help.   Amazon Japan search  Amazon Japan complete 12 set  You could also try Yahoo Japan or Mandarake (Japanese reseller?)."
Oreimo,21vrdd,-Niernen,1 point,Tue Apr 1 02:04:58 2014 UTC,"A way to buy off Amazon Japan is to use Tenso.  Tenso is a company that let's you use a Japanese ""address"" to order things through some Japanese websites. You buy it on (for example) Amazon Japan and ship it to their address. They then weigh the package and charge you for shipping to the US.  Yes, it's another step in the process and a slight hassle. Yes, it's more worth it of you buy a lot of products at once because shipping isn't cheap from Japan (a 5 pound package to North America is around $55). However, if you know what you want and don't mind a bit of a wait, it's worth it.  Edit: English is hard"
Oreimo,21vrdd,FliryVorru,1 point,Tue Apr 1 03:30:21 2014 UTC,Shipping rates are just ridiculous for anything that goes across the ocean. Don't tell me that little package put a heavy load on the heavy ass carrier that is usually fine with tons and tons of storage containers. This is especially true with Japan because shipping companies know we can't buy this stuff elsewhere..  I just hope one day someone will come up with a less expensive/scammy way to ship

Oreimo,21kgt1,-Niernen,3,Fri Mar 28 20:56:00 2014 UTC,"Interesting. The scanlated page is less, rude, I guess. I didn't like this manga as much, it made Kirino seem way more ecchi than the LN  or anime."
Oreimo,21kgt1,KirinoMyWaifu,3,Fri Mar 28 14:23:23 2014 UTC,"Not a big fan of the manga, personally cant stand the art style, especially the way Kirino is drawn."
Oreimo,21kgt1,-Niernen,3,Fri Mar 28 18:17:05 2014 UTC,Same for me. Its too different.
Oreimo,21kgt1,KirinoMyWaifu,1 point,Fri Mar 28 19:11:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah it definitely is different, but I think it is very well done. The art style in the manga is fantastic.   If you're a big Kirino fan, though, you might be disappointed in the manga that she doesn't look the same :P"
Oreimo,21kgt1,Tomoko_Kuroki,0,Sat Mar 29 13:54:54 2014 UTC,"It's not just the fact it's different, I don't find that the style suits the series, especially compared to the amazing LN drawings.   Kirino's way more ecchi in the manga, as Niernen said earlier, which puts me off a bit too."
Oreimo,21fqwa,onigkkwgn,6,Wed Mar 26 18:55:11 2014 UTC,"Actually, in Japan, the figure was exclusive to Dengekiya and Amazon JP. Amazon JP still has stock, as do some export stores selling it unofficially.  Word of caution though: this figure is huge (box itself is 15""x12""x12"") and heavy (about 1.7 kg for just the figure+box, add packing materials on top of that). Also, both the box and figure are gorgeous, so I don't think I'll be disposing of the box as I usually do...  Although, by far the best (Kirino) figure that I own."
Oreimo,21fqwa,-Niernen,7,Wed Mar 26 19:18:43 2014 UTC,If only there was a Kyousuke in a suit figure to go with this.   I'm pretty sure most places had sold out of this figure too >.<

Oreimo,21dd4h,Timae09,6,Wed Mar 26 00:17:57 2014 UTC,"You didn't miss anything, rather your expectations are too fast.  Anime releases outside Japan can take anywhere from months to years before coming out. You can read this article for more information, but the gist is that distributing anime doesn't make a lot of revenue outside Japan, and domestic Japanese distributors want to prevent reverse-importing of anime into Japan from other countries. Combining the two factors, the big names in Japan aren't in any rush to license series for distribution very quickly, if at all.  Aniplex is actually one of the better studios in that regard. Let's have a look at Oreimo S1 for reference:   October 2010: Oreimo S1 airs December 2010: Oreimo S1 finishes airing; Vol 1 is released in Japan January-June 2011: One Vol is released/month; OVAs air between Feb-May July 2011: Vol 8 is released in Japan July 2012: Complete S1 DVD boxset released in North America (localized) February 2013: Complete S1 blu-ray boxset released in Japan and North America (identical sets)   So, by that precedent, I would expect an American-localized release early next year at the earliest. Complete blu-ray boxset may take a while as well... at least two years IMO. Also, if the blu-ray set sold abroad is identical to the Japanese one, as was S1, expect it to cost at least $300."

Oreimo,21b0xt,enigmatican,4,Tue Mar 25 07:43:27 2014 UTC,"AFAIK, nobody has really subbed them yet. A scarce few of the specials have been subbed by /u/DizzyZiddy, and I have summarized a few of them in previous posts.  If you can understand Japanese, the RAW versions float about on the interwebs.   If the above doesn't mean much to you, a quick search on Youtube shows a few badly-cam-recorded shots from Volumes 2-3-4. One of Vol 1's specials is subbed here. Here is a summary I made for Vols 1-2-3. Note that DizzyZiddy has subbed a few of the Oreimo HD PS3 disc scenes on Youtube. Here is a breakdown of parts of Vol 4's specials. Finally, here is the first of two playthrough routes for Vol 8, once again subbed by DizzyZiddy. EDIT: DizzyZiddy has just released the last Vol 8 playthrough route!   Will anyone ever sub the extras properly? If some group picks it up, perhaps, but I haven't seen much interest in the community so far. Otherwise, there's a decent chance that the Complete S2 boxset release in Japan will have English subtitles, if Aniplex follows the same model it did for S1.  If you want better summaries of Vols 4-8, I can try writing it up if there's any interest in it."
Oreimo,21b0xt,onigkkwgn,3,Tue Mar 25 16:54:04 2014 UTC,"I haven't heard of them, what are they called and where are the unsubbed episodes? Maybe I can help search through the internet for a subbed version. :D"

Oreimo,212ukd,megustafap,7,Sat Mar 22 15:08:32 2014 UTC,"Haganai references other animes like whoa. It's not an in-episode reference, but the 3rd episode of Haganai NEXT is titled Ore no Imōto-tachi ga Konna ni Kawaii, or ""My Little Sisters Are This Cute"".  I can't remember if that's the episode where they go to Comiket.  I'm bored as hell at work so I'll keep my eyes open for other references in both directions.  EDIT #1: Found a reference to Sword Art Online with the mini figures in Saori's flat during Oreimo S02E04.  EDIT #2: Not a direct reference per say, but there's definitely a Yosuga no Sora vibe from the bike scene in Oreimo S02E10  EDIT #3: AHA! In Railgun S02E01 a random character is reading Oreimo manga (zoomed and rotated)  EDIT #4: in Accel World episode 08 there's a dialogue reference that's pretty blatant.  EDIT #5: in Nyarko-san: Another Crawling Chaos W episode 8 this scene (sorry, can't find a subbed screen-cap) has Nyaruko saying the line ""Watashi no petto ga, konna ni youjo na wake ga arimasen!"" (There's no way my pet could be such a little girl!). The grammar structure leads me to believe that it's an intentional reference.

In terms of references that Oreimo makes of other series, consult this fairly extensive list at TV Tropes."
Oreimo,212ukd,BuildBruh,1 point,Sun Mar 23 22:04:05 2014 UTC,"Wait. i just realized something. Did Oreimo indirectly bust the SAO universe? If SAO was just an anime in oreimo (even if it was just this specific universe), that would mean Accel world never happened (or was just another anime). If accel world was an anime in this universe, then it would be a reference to the anime that subsequently destroyed an anime's plot.    My mind hurts from thinking that through..."

Oreimo,211fhc,Adept94,6,Sat Mar 22 00:00:57 2014 UTC,"No, Manami does not ""safe"" Kyouske. She tries to shape him into the perfect person for her. She completely removes his drive and motivation to do anything. Sure, she is there for him and tries to help him with his problems with Kirino, but not for Kirino, but so Kyousuke will trust her. If she gave him crappy advice, he would figure it out. And if he trusts her, he would be more likely to fall for her. She wants him to be the perfect person for him, and instead of accepting him as he is, she tries to change him. Its not like he was a bad person before that needed to be changed. She is also overly harsh in telling the young Kirino that she is too close to her brother and that it is wrong. Instead of trying to explain it to her, she just insults and hurts Kirino. And she kind of starts the fight with who should take care of Kyousuke while he is living alone.   My biggest problem with her is that she never makes a move when she could. She was the closest to him at the begging. He may not have seen her romantically, but she does not even try that hard. She of all people should know how thick headed Kyousuke is, but she does not try really hard, probably because she does not have any rivals. She does nothing till the end, and then tries to forcefully breakup Kirino and Kyousuke.   Oh, and she has short hair. All the other love interests have long hair. Long hair is obviously superior."
Oreimo,211fhc,-Niernen,3,Sat Mar 22 02:27:20 2014 UTC,"She did try to get the wife position. Putting Ayase in charge was Kirino's idea.   I'm probably forgetting, but when does Manami help Kyousuke with Kirino? The only time I recall is when she told him to help her find new friends, which if you're really digging could be interpreted as dumping Kirino's issues on someone else and away from Kyousuke.  In volume 11 Manami wanted to reiterate to Kirino, and ideally Kyousuke, that Kyousuke isn't the super hero that Kirino once thought him as. In that volume both Kirino and Manami notice that Kyousuke has returned somewhat to his old ways, and Kirino supports it while Manami hates it. Kirino already knew that Manami was right about old Kyousuke, she admits it in her monologue in volume 9. The way I see it, Manami wanted to remind Kyousuke of his failings so he'd revert back to the way he was at the beginning of the series, where he was dependent on Manami. You can see hints of her trying to do this prior to the Kuroneko break up as well, and she likely wanted to use that break up as a Sakurai incident v2, but Kyousuke went to Kirino instead. This goal is further supported by Manami's frustration as volume 11 concludes, and again when she screams something along the lines of ""Everything would've been fine if Kirino hadn't ruined everything"" ie. by bringing back Kyousuke's confidence.  Yeah, Manami is trying to protect him from harm when she comforted him after the Sakurai incident. I don't buy that her thoughts were malicious at this time though others are convinced they were. Where it becomes an issue is the fact that she saw the drastic effect this had on Kyousuke's confidence and relationship with his family and yet did nothing to right it. When she encountered Kirino she pretended none of it ever happened and that everything was completely normal. It wasn't until things grew out of her control that she actually made an attempt to bring the siblings together and work out their issues, four years too late. The end could be similar if she were actually rational, but Manami went in planning a violent reaction because her thoughts were based more around her grudge than protecting the Kyousuke who's behavior she didn't like.   The PSP games are infamous for completely disregarding Kyousuke's character development in favor of fulfilling ships, and in this case it's really no different. The progression or lack of progression of Kyousuke's character plays a key role in why Kirino and Manami love him. The outcome is different not only because they're not related but also because this complexity doesn't exist in the PSP games.   So I come to a similar conclusion that Manami is protective, but she's protective through possessiveness. Yes, she's very motherly, but motherly in the way where she won't let her kid leave the house to make mistakes and live his life. Instead of helping him up and telling him to give it another shot when Kyousuke fell down and scraped his knees, Manami told him to stop running.   As for Kyousuke being fine with Manami's mothering, this wasn't always the case and it's quite the opposite in the second half of the series. He'd grown dependent on Manami's mothering because he lost his confidence and the support of his sister, and Manami continued to insist that a boring life was better for him. By the end Kyousuke actually outright says he's going to make his own decisions and not take her advice.   Manami's plans aren't demonic. That evil plan picture is heavily biased and was written in a time where volume 12 wasn't released and much of volume 11 wasn't properly understood. Regardless of good intentions, she still went about what she did all wrong, saw the backlash and stood idle, and then snapped when everything came tumbling down. She was stuck on the idea that Kyousuke would be a boring and safe husband to her and didn't notice that the Kyou-chan she loved never really existed."

Oreimo,20p3yw,shadybones,12,Tue Mar 18 05:22:11 2014 UTC,"The ending left me feeling empty. I feel like I want to cry, but the tears just won't come. I always hear people talk about how they're sad when they're done a good anime or a good book, because they can no longer experience any more adventures with the characters, and this is the first time I've ever been able to say I know what they mean.  After finishing the very last episode, I couldn't accept it, I re-watched s2 episodes 14-16 over literally right after I finished the anime yesterday, and then I watched it again today, but this time I paused it where they kiss, and I wanted to end it there, but I couldn't bring myself to do it, so I finished the last few minutes.  I've watched so many animes where people tell me they've cried a bunch, and while I've felt emotionally invested in characters, this is the first time I've felt as if someone I know and cherish in real life has died."
Oreimo,20p3yw,ScarletITears,2,Tue Mar 18 06:21:09 2014 UTC,I can totally relate with this feeling. I just didn't know what to feel after finishing it...
Oreimo,20p3yw,SamMee514,2,Tue Mar 18 11:00:34 2014 UTC,"I don't think I can relate more to those words. Oreimo was the first anime, and so far the only, to make me feel so empty after finishing it.   I didn't even know what to do when it was over.  Honestly, I think thei video from 0:25 to 1:35 sums up my feelings on Oreimo as best as possible. http://youtu.be/k2mHM5XuRWw  The reviewer obviously isn't reviewing Oreimo, but I share the same thoughts as him."
Oreimo,20p3yw,KirinoMyWaifu,6,Tue Mar 18 11:33:39 2014 UTC,"The great thing about this anime and why it is my number 2 anime of all time, number 1 in the rom com section of my personal ratings is this:   Not only does it show you how hard an incest relationship would be via real world scenarios and quirkiness between love relationships, at the end the one line that always got me was, ""A slightly special tale of love between two average siblings that started with a request for advice. If it makes you smile at least once, I'll be happy.""   That's it. It was a story of a piece of someone elses life, taken at a snippet and we had the pleasure of sharing those memories with that person. I know it's depressing thinking you'll never be a part of those exact memories. But what got me is that it's such a realistic part of life, we can only experience what our life has to offer. We will never be able to live someone elses life, so lets live ours to the fullest and make great stories of our own. Atleast, that's what I got from those words."

Unlike other Kuroneko doujins, which just goes to a straight forward Kuroneko story ending, this one actually balances well between Kuroneko Kyousuke coupling and emotional conflicts between Kyousuke and Kirino, Ayase, Kanako, Saori and other characters. I won't spoil it further, but personally I would consider it as one of the highest quality oreimo doujin story out there."

After Kuroneko got rejected and cried I also cried for a while, no other anime character has reached my heart like she did, and her rejection scene was the most painfull thing in an anime I've dealt with. Even though it's been 4 months I'm still not over it. But what personally helped me move on the most was I just continued watching more and more anime, specifically comedy anime (Seitokai Yakuindomo) and that really helped me move on a bit. I also went back and watched the episodes where Kuroneko and Kyosuke dated, and the certainly lifted my spirits a lot. Sorry that's all I can recommend but it's how I got past the ending of Oreimo.  edit: derpy spelling"

Oreimo,20p3yw,stitchwithaglitch,2,Wed Mar 19 11:28:10 2014 UTC,"I'm copying and pasting this into threads where people are sad about the ending so everyone can have the peace of mind it gave me to know what the true ending actually is from the author's perspective  ""In the main story [as contrasted with the PSP game], I couldn't write an ending where Kirino's affection is truly and entirely rewarded. Various circumstances prevented me from plainly writing that sort of ending. Nonetheless, I realized that she cared deeply for [Kyousuke], and so I felt I had to do something for her. Fushimi's comments strongly suggest that he wanted to write a different ending - presumably a more ""taboo"" one in which Kirino and Kyousuke remain in a relationship - but was prevented from doing so by his publishers. Hence the ""until we graduate"" provision.""  http://puu.sh/7B6QO.png  We have to keep in mind Japanese culture is much less open and very formal in comparison to what we live in (and even in America, it's not like most people are okay with incest). If he decided to have the true ending that we all wanted (including Fushimi, the author), it would've been the end of his career. It brings me peace of mind to know that the true ending he wrote is basically the point at which Kirino and Kyousuke kiss in the church, and then the extra bit about them ending it and becoming normal siblings was just tagged on to satisfy the publishers.  Who knows, maybe after he retires, he'll rewrite an unofficial ending, but it basically was supposed to end at the kiss in the church, from the implications given, but with a lot more epilogue. This also explains why they aren't making any more OVAs for the sake of the fans. Fushimi probably just finds that tacking on any more to the story will deviate from what truly happened in his original story, and makes it a moot point.  Anyhow, I have to say, knowing the story behind the story makes this anime now rank #1 in my anime list. If I ever decide to re-watch it, I'll be sure to pause the anime right after the kiss where they both say ""We did it."" to each other, and end it on that note. I feel like a weight has been taken off my shoulders! I'm so in love with the anime now, more than ever!!"

It way, way over represents the Otaku and makes them seem much better received than they are. Any character that is not or does not support otakus (the parents, Ayase), is shown in a negative light until they come to accept it. They view is very unrealistic of the overall Japanese culture. /u/Bobduh had some pretty good break downs on how unrealistic the setting and otaku culture is represented.   Also, don't let anime overtake your social life, you may regret it later. You have to have some moderation. It may be tempting to sit there and maraton every show you haven't seen, but it is not always the best idea.   And I urge you to read the Light Novels, translations by Baka Tsuki.

Oreimo,1z66ay,Fissie,5,Fri Feb 28 12:58:48 2014 UTC,"The problem with that is that they would have to make the Ayase ark after the fact, and it wouldn't fit into the timeline since the show is over. They honestly should have had 2 cours for the second season so they could do the Ayase and Kanako arcs. The Ayase arc could easily be 2-3 episodes, and another 2-3 for Kanako would have been 4-6 episodes, stick the 3 OVAs and you would have 21 episode season. If you stick all the parts left out between volumes 9-12. They cut out all of Sakurai Akimi's arc, which explain Kyousuke and Manami's back story and how and why Kyouske changes. They also cut out most of volume 9 since it is told from multiple characters points of view. Hoenstly, with all they cut out they could have easily made another cour."

Oreimo,1z1wql,keanotaku,8,Thu Feb 27 03:05:44 2014 UTC,"I'm from the original thread.   Many people, especially on this subreddit, place too much importance on having a happy ending (something which you see a lot in Western storytelling), and dislike it because it doesn't play out to their personal expectations, something I am guilty of. I appreciate your perspective on the ending that takes it for what it is, instead of chalking it all up to publisher interference."
Oreimo,1z1wql,kiririno,3,Thu Feb 27 04:51:31 2014 UTC,"This is so true. You can see that stories that have bad endings usually get trashed by people and dismissed as horrible, just because it did not end the way they wanted or expected to. I will admit when I originally watched the ending (i marathoned the whole S1-2+OVAs in 2 days) I was upset that there was no romantic conclusion. After reading the novels and taking a deeper look at the series, I makes much more sense. I have to accept it, since there is no way to change it, but that doesn't mean I have to like it."
Oreimo,1z1wql,-Niernen,5,Thu Feb 27 15:17:05 2014 UTC,"The entire argument almost sounds repulsive to me, in my opinion. But that's just it, it's an opinion and should be treated as such. People may boo the topic of incest or any other trait that is the ""non-norm"" in mass society. But, and this is a big but for me, if it doesn't affect your life then you must respect those other peoples choices and let them be. Life, again in my opinion, is about learning to live with other people and finding true happiness for yourself. Incest or not, if you love a person be with them. Anyone who thinks otherwise in my eyes needs to separate their own thoughts and realize your opinion should not be pushed onto someone else in any way during your life on this planet. Atleast, that's what I believe. Live in your own way, respect everyone else. Love like it's all you have. Love like it's easy. Most of all, love."
Oreimo,1z1wql,tHe_FaT_tAcO,2,Thu Feb 27 08:21:50 2014 UTC,"I agree with this, if only more people did. Thenagain, there is a large difference between a 2D and 3D relationship. I'm sure anyone that went ahead with a incestuous relationships would face a lot of problems in society. Live and let live (or love and let love) are great sayings, but everyone has to agree on them."
Oreimo,1z1wql,-Niernen,1 point,Thu Feb 27 15:36:41 2014 UTC,"I wasn't suggesting that I, my argument, or Oreimo, were agreeing with or advocating the views of society or social norms; I was saying that Oreimo is just pointing out how society really is and what would happen to people like Kyosuke and Kirino in society; sometimes the only way to best get the message across is in the harshest way possible - the truth isn't always good news."
Oreimo,1z1wql,DinTwo,6,Thu Feb 27 17:07:30 2014 UTC,"I guess that's one way of looking at it.  I disagree, though, and prefer the interpretations presented by these: http://pastebin.com/MWLcYrqv http://pastebin.com/A6DN36wu http://pastebin.com/VixaBZ8F As they seem to be more consistent with all nuances of the story rather than just bits and pieces. I think too much importance is given to the otaku aspects of the characters, particularly here on reddit, when that was more the hook than the point. In my opinion the depth of the series lies in Kirino and Kyousuke's characters, history, and development. The double life aspect of the story is encompassed by these in Kyousuke's past, normal, and super self, and of course Kirino's interests. Saori's conflict is more that of abandonment issues than a double life, and Kuroneko's isolation is barely touched on. The conflict regarding their lifestyle choices is more a matter of sticking what, or who, you're passionate about than a demonstration of challenging the taboo.  Your interpretation seems to discard Kyousuke's past and his development throughout the series, which in my opinion is as important if not more important than any other character's. His attitude at the end is essentially that he'll do anything for Kirino but he's holding back for their sake.   What role is Ayase supposed play once the judgmental aspect passes? She's quite alright with Kirino's hobbies in the second half of the series.   There's also the matter of the epilogue existing. Seeing as how the kiss was intended to be on the lips and the general tone of the scene being quite lighthearted I don't really see how it fits the picture you're presenting.   I think the anime has mislead people into thinking the story is dramatic and depressing because all of the light-hearted stuff was cut from season 2 for time. Rather than a 'downer' or 'tragic' ending, I'd describe it as hopeful, and the extras that came with the final BD seem to suggest that Kyousuke agrees."
Oreimo,1z1wql,-Niernen,3,Thu Feb 27 06:05:04 2014 UTC,"Yeah, cutting out most of volumes 9-12 so they could finish in one cour really left out a lot of character development and backstory. When we learn about Kyousuke's backstory near the end, we can she how he has grown over the series. While he may not be as loud spoken and brash as he was as a child,  he also is not as lazy or ""normal"" by the end as he was at the beginning. He reached a good point where he can live his own life while helping others and speaking his mind. You can see how much Manami influenced him at the start, and how he broke out of her grasp by the end. The end scene in the part was interesting; he will go against Manami (which could represnt things holding him back), but would never go against his dad (or society). Even till the end, he puts others before him. He rejected the rest of the girls because he put Kirino above all else. Although at the end, he does try to do something for himself with the kiss. (He really should have saved that wish for H stuff though, but he is not that kind of person)  Saori's confilcts are given a much larger role in the LN, in the anime she falls back to support Kyouske when he is in need. The LN expands more on her shyness and abandonment issues and how she works to get over them and make up with hr sister. Kuroenko and her family are the focus of multiple chapters that get cut out of the LN. You really lose a sense of her development, how far and how little she progresses.   Ayase's whole arc is cut from the anime. I will have to say she is not alright with Kirino's hobby, but he has accepted she can not change it and tries to work towards understanding it. She has accepted Kirino with the hobby, but the the hobby itself. She does grow more understanding words the Kousaka's as she helps Kyouske out. In the anime, her confession comes out of nowhere and there is nothing to explain it. They leave out the part where they go shopping and take care of a baby, which lets Ayase see how they could be a couple. They leave out the very important Stalker ark, which shows how kind Kyouske is and that he is willing to put others before him.   The story is dramatic, but it is not supposed to be depressing. Sure,  there are some sad moments when he rejects Kuroneko and Ayase, but that shouldn't be depressing, that is what happens in real life too. There were plenty of serious moments and happy moments. Honestly, if they had started earlier they could have made three-four cours instead of the 2 cours and half a cour of OVA's.   Also, just to point out, but the blu ray extras take place before they broke up and are supposed to expand on how their relationship works."
Oreimo,1z1wql,-Niernen,5,Thu Feb 27 15:34:15 2014 UTC,"I honestly never get how anyone could be surprised by the incest ending with a title like ""My Little Sister can't be this cute.  On the topic of incest itself, I somewhat agree with the video. It has become a social taboo. While the chances of having birth defects or mutations is higher between siblings, it is not so hugely significant that it would cause some horrible monster in one generation. There have been plenty of incestuous couples in the past that had fine children. The problems start happening when it continues on into further generations. With each generation the chance for mutations would rise exponentially. So while it is not really a big issue biologically for one generation, further inbreeding would cause problems.   Society is where the real issue comes up. Authors often use the excuse that they are not blood related, usually by some accident that killed off the parents of the adopted. This is somehow makes it okay now, because you removed the biological aspect. However, that does not remove the brother-sister relationship. In the PSP game (the Kousakas are not related), Sena says that even if she found out she was not related to her brother, she could never see him romantically because they grew up as siblings (of course her siscon brother would probably disagree). I think that is the bigger issue, is that romance would not develop from a normal brother-sister relationship. Kirino responds by saying that they had treated each other like strangers and had not considered them to be siblings for years. That is not typical, and that is what lets them develop like that. In most incestuous stories, the brother and sister do not have a normal relationship, usually from the beginning.   Oreimo was much more complex that it appears at a first glance. It has so many different themes and ideas, and some very subtle ones. I think the biggest issue a lot of people had was they did not see the subtler theme and were surprised when they became more obvious. IT upset quite a few people that could not accept them, and people often over looked many of them or recognized them. It did take a look at complex societal issues and norms, I'm sure that if you go back and watch the anime again, you will see that almost every episode could deal with a separate societal norm (or more).   I do like happy endings, and was upset that there was no romantic conclusion to Oreimo initially. I heard from interviews that the author had initially planned another ending, but the publishers would not allow something like a full incest ending. The series and ending said a lot about society. I really want a sequel, to see how their relationship and lives work out in the future (and to find out who that 4th girl is). I doubt there will be a similar series soon. There will be plenty of incest series, but nothing that does what Oreimo does."
Oreimo,1z1wql,kiririno,1 point,Thu Feb 27 15:14:17 2014 UTC,"You also see the ""unusual"" brother-sister relationship and cirumstances in Yosuga no Sora and Koi Kaze where the siblings did not grow up together. It's something you see even outside of anime, for example in Flowers in the Attic."
Oreimo,1z1wql,Atario,1 point,Thu Feb 27 17:34:57 2014 UTC,"I don't think anyone can legitimately complain about the incest subtext.  It's what the show is.  It's like complaining that Saturday Night Live has a lot of sketches.  That obviously doesn't mean one has to approve of incest.  Taboos are common fodder for storytelling; something being forbidden makes it interesting, even if one agrees with the forbidding.  The problem with the ending is not that it's a downer, or that it seems to approve of incest, or that one's favorite girl got the short end of the stick.  The problem is that it's a stupid ending.  Kyousuke burns his bridges with a whole bevy of great girls, many of which might have ended up the love of his life, all so that he can spend two weeks pretending to be his own sister's boyfriend.  After that, they just go right back to how they were.  Nothing gained, much lost, and all chosen on purpose.  That's colossally stupid."
Oreimo,1z1wql,-Niernen,1 point,Sun Mar 2 14:06:15 2014 UTC,"Few things. He does not burn any bridges. Just because he does not go out with them does not me the rest of the girls suddenly disappear from his life, as you can see with Kuroneko quite clearly. Also, they go out for much longer than two weeks, it is a couple of months between Christmas and when school ends. You seem to think all the girls hate him because he chose Kirino. They all knew he would pick Kirino, but they chose to confess anyways, it would be worse for them if they didn't and were left wondering ""what if"" for the rest of their lives."
Oreimo,1z1wql,Atario,0,Sun Mar 2 17:19:26 2014 UTC,"I find it hard to believe anyone's going to feel like taking up with him again after being rejected for his own sister.  Two weeks was an exaggeration, but I should have said five minutes to make it clearer.  An inconsequential amount of time is what I meant.  But I have no problem with the way the girls acted (except maybe Kirino) — it's Kyousuke who was dumb."
Oreimo,1z1wql,-Niernen,1 point,Mon Mar 3 07:24:27 2014 UTC,"That would mean his time dating Kuroneko, which was closer to weeks, was also pointless since nothing come from that either. The amount of time is not as big as what you do with it. And if you read the light novels, you would know that the girls had a talk with Kirino where they said they would each confess, even though they all knew that Kyouske would pick Kirino. Kuroneko was still pretty accepting of him after the fact.   But say he should chose a girl that he truly does not love and that would always be second is dumb itself."
Oreimo,1z1wql,Atario,1 point,Mon Mar 3 19:24:00 2014 UTC,"That would mean his time dating Kuroneko, which was closer to weeks, was also pointless since nothing come from that either. The amount of time is not as big as what you do with it.   My point is that he went into it with Kirino with an explicit time limit set ahead of time.  But I would argue that breaking up with her was also dumb, so I kinda agree, in a way…   And if you read the light novels   I did not.   the girls had a talk with Kirino where they said they would each confess   Huh, kinda weird.  Is this before or after Kuroneko confesses?"
Oreimo,1z1wql,-Niernen,1 point,Mon Mar 3 19:50:07 2014 UTC,"Which time? its after the first actual confession but before her rejection.  And read the light novels.   [The bluray specials also explain in greater detail how they spend their relationship, what they do and how they grow closer)."
Oreimo,1z1wql,DinTwo,1 point,Mon Mar 3 19:55:59 2014 UTC,"Kyousuke was never going to adhere to the 'time limit' Kirino set. That's the whole point of the epilogue, Kyousuke keeping the agreement a secret from everyone, and the reason he barely flinched when their relationship was 'ending' while Kirino was torn before the wedding.  He probably agreed to Kirino's plan to give her comfort for the months they dated. Everything about Kyousuke's inner monologue in the final volume, epilogue, and extras screams that Kyousuke's going to continue pursuing Kirino after they 'go back to being normal siblings'.   There's dozens of lengthy posts and summaries written about the ending and you're making elementary complaints that are easily addressed by skimming the final volume or even the posts earlier in this thread. If you were actually looking to clear up your qualms rather than seek people who are equally miserable, you would've already found what you're looking for, but from your posts it seems like this is more about Kuroneko than figuring Oreimo out.  Also as a quick edit I'd like to point out they dated from Christmas until graduation, which is well over two weeks, and it only really ended in title."

Oreimo,1z1wql,Mysterius,1 point,Mon Mar 3 07:06:43 2014 UTC,"If by ""real"" you mean what the author would have preferred to write, instead of what he was forced to publish, then the real ending would have played Kirino/Kyousuke straight, for good and ill, without that takeback-after-two-weeks nonsense.    IIRC, his comments also suggested that he imagines Kirino and Kyousuke continuing to hold romantic feelings for each other post-series, just more covertly than during their two-week public affair. And said that their last kiss in the series was meant to be on the lips, rather than the more chaste scene the anime ended with.    That, at least, is what I gathered from the commentary on reddit when the anime concluded, amidst all the discussion it generated."

Oreimo,1ycvtq,nashgasm,11,Wed Feb 19 17:23:04 2014 UTC,"Kuroneko wanted all 4 (don't forget Saori) of them to be friends and remain close forever. That does not mean that she would have needed to be dating Kyouske. While she still had feelings for him and liked him, it was not necessary for them to be in a relationship to achieve her perfect world. Also, I don't know how well Kirino and Kuroenko would  have been able to share him if they were dating. Kirino may not have been as upset if they were on equal standing (unlike when Kuroneko was dating him), But she also said she wants to be the most important person to him. Also, there are things he could  do with Kuroneko that he would not be able to do with Kirino, which would make there relationships unbalanced.   But if you do want to see a traid, read the Doujin Love Replica 5. Obviously NSFW.  Personally, I think it would have worked out well if Kuroneko and Kyouske had gotten together later. Kirino would always be their friend, and she would get to fawn over any kawaii kids they had."
Oreimo,1ycvtq,-Niernen,2,Wed Feb 19 17:53:30 2014 UTC,"other than getting legally married, and likely having kids, there isnt much kuroneko could do with kyousuke that kiririn couldnt. especially if, say, they moved to a new town and started over. it seemed that kuroneko also had a love interest with kiririn in that at one point it said they all held hands and such. kuroneko seems to have accepted not being the most important woman to kyousuke, but it also seemed she would be happy to be with them both regardless. none of this has to happen though, thats true, and though her perfect world could have happened as friends with all, i doubt that was the intended takeaway, it seemed more... loaded than that during plot exposition.  to each their own, there is much here to consider."
Oreimo,1ycvtq,-Niernen,3,Wed Feb 19 18:06:30 2014 UTC,"Most people Refer to Kirino as Kirino, and not Kiririn, since she rarely uses her handle name. Opposite for Kuroneko (since she went half the series before we found out her name was Ruri).  Also, they have accepted they can not escape reality. Sure, they could probably run away, but they would leave behind many friends and family, and it unless they totally start from scratch it would not do much. Plus, Kyousuke has college, and Kirino her modeling job, it wouldn't really be possible to drop everything and run away.   And the biggest issue is obviously the law (and society). Not many areas would allow incestuous marriage,  running away does not really change that. And can you image how people would react if they found out the cute couple next door with kids were brother and sister? It would not work well for the parents or children."
Oreimo,1ycvtq,Histy,0,Wed Feb 19 20:40:52 2014 UTC,"was there some question as to what people call kirino or kuroneko? or taking issue with me calling kirino kiririn?  i literally point blank recognized they couldnt get married or have kids, and i am not saying they should or have to. its always possible to drop everything and run away, it doesnt make it practical. i know this. so what? its an anime for crying out loud."
Oreimo,1ycvtq,Histy,8,Wed Feb 19 21:10:01 2014 UTC,"It is because Kyousuke loves Kirino.  He has had a lot of time to think about his relationship with the other girls and decided to turn each of them down, because he loved someone else. Kuroneko had been and still is their good friend at the end of the series. Kyousuke is not the kind of person who will string Kuroneko along by pretending to love her when his feelings are not sufficient enough to fulfill her dreams.  Nor the dreams of Ayase, Kanako or Manami, because his heart belongs to Kirino."
Oreimo,1ycvtq,Histy,1 point,Wed Feb 19 18:08:33 2014 UTC,"see thats what i dont get. why couldnt he love kuroneko, and kiririn love kuroneko, and kuroneko love them both? it seemed like that was what she was aiming for, especially after her clarifying picture in her diary. everyone else, it makes sense, they werent considering having a poly relationship, so it would be impossible for them to accept kiririn, but kuroneko explicitly said that was ok. cant we have just one anime without the mainstream 'you can only love one person' line, an anime where a group can love each other?"
Oreimo,1ycvtq,-Niernen,8,Wed Feb 19 18:12:33 2014 UTC,"If you only look at it from Kuroneko's perspective, then that makes sense.  But Kyousuke's feelings have to be put into consideration and by rejecting Kuroneko, he made it clear that such a relationship was not viable and that he could only love Kirino and not fulfill Kuroneko's dream of being his most important person at the same time.  If they were in such a relationship, Kuroneko would ultimately take a backseat to Kirino. Kyousuke is a smart guy, I am sure he has thought about it. But he would rather be upfront about the status of the relationship, as he said he would be, than be dishonest and ""love"" someone who he couldn't love the way they deserve to be loved.  He loves all the girls for sure and is grateful for everything they have done and shared with him. But by the end, his feelings and his heart are devoted to Kirino. It would be unfair to the other girls if he got into a relationship but couldn't love them the way he loves Kirino."
Oreimo,1ycvtq,-Niernen,1 point,Wed Feb 19 18:34:35 2014 UTC,"thats exactly it. i am really just whining about wanting a tad different main character who IS capable of loving kuroneko, if not as much as kirino, enough to provide for a happy  life for all three of them. and for kirino to love kuroneko as much as well. it seemed like a possibility, and i have never seen an anime that actually accepts such a possibility. it would have been unique, and kept one of the most endeared characters from just... getting tossed aside. besides, three is more than two, and where love is concerned, how is more worse?"
Oreimo,1ycvtq,-Niernen,7,Wed Feb 19 18:38:29 2014 UTC,"Oreimo probably isn't the anime if you're looking for a harem ending.  Love is a complex beast and having one relationship with another person brings both happiness and struggles. Bringing in a third wheel makes things even more difficult, because of the balance of the relationship that needs to be maintained in order for everyone to be happy. This is an extremely difficult thing to accomplish successfully, both in real life and in fiction, which is why you don't see it often.  So when Kyousuke feels he can't love Kuroneko enough, it is not a relationship worth pursuing, because it will only hurt all parties in the long run. Kuroneko says she is okay with them being all together, but by her actions during the housewarming party, I feel her words and true feelings don't quite match up."
Oreimo,1ycvtq,KaleGen,1 point,Wed Feb 19 18:52:26 2014 UTC,"love is a complex beasty, and thats why i am sad we dont see complex endings, actually trying to give love a chance rather than going with the mainstream 'can only maintain one relationship' stance. i know how complex balancing loving relationships can be irl, and i know how difficult it can be on an intimate level. but it can be done, and done very happily. not without ups and downs, of course, but so has every relationship. i just wanted a non standard happy ending."
Oreimo,1ycvtq,KaleGen,1 point,Wed Feb 19 18:59:44 2014 UTC,"Well, complex endings are hard to do for many reasons. Making a complex ending often does not make fans happy, because they want to know more, like how the complex problem/solution works out in the future. Choosing multiple girls would not only be hard to do, but then people would want to know how it works out."
Oreimo,1ycvtq,-Niernen,-2,Wed Feb 19 21:08:54 2014 UTC,"are you going to go through and reply to absolutely everything i said in this thread?   dont people want to know how it works out in any case regardless of how many individuals are involved? none of this obviates a complex ending. so what if its hard? doesnt mean it shouldnt be desired, doesnt mean it wont be good."
Oreimo,1ycvtq,Histy,3,Wed Feb 19 21:11:58 2014 UTC,"Isn't the point of a discussion to reply to others?   Anyways, many shows end right after the boy gets the girl. In shows where the whole point if for the boy to get a/the girl, when he finally does, the show usually ends shortly later. Sometimes they will spend episode or so to show their happy ever after, but if the guy gets multiple girls the ending is not as simple."
Oreimo,1ycvtq,Cherry_Venus,0,Wed Feb 19 23:15:32 2014 UTC,"i was only asking so i would know in what ways to cut up my responses. it also seems to be more efficient to make one long post, hitting all the key points, rather than six or seven all for little ole me to parse and respond to.  exactly. the ending would be worth shows expanding and exploring this new aspect of the story. every time a show wraps after the boy getting the girl, its a bit disappointing, isnt it?"
Oreimo,1ycvtq,Cherry_Venus,2,Wed Feb 19 23:34:07 2014 UTC,"Well, there are different types of ""loves"". Kuroneko wants to be with them, and she can still do that if Kyousuke is not in a relationship with her. While Kyouske certainly likes Kuroneko, he does not love her, and he won't force himself to try because it would probably just end up hurting them both. While Kirino does love Kuroneko, it is in the best friend way, not the relationship way (like the way Ayase seems to love Kirino). The love the Kousaka's have for Kuroneko is not the romantic kind,  it is the best friend kind. Trying to turn it into the romantic kind would just not work, and they know that.   And ""mainstream"" can rarely ever break social taboo, especially somewhere like Japan, which is much stricter (at least the older generation). Polygamy and full, true incest are not going to happen. Also, that would make the media in question 18+, which removes much of the market. Can you imagine how much harder it would be to talk about Oreimo if it was 18+? If you want the harem or incest ends, you have to go to 18+ or doujins."
Oreimo,1ycvtq,Cherry_Venus,1 point,Wed Feb 19 20:49:08 2014 UTC,See! All of my friends said I was crazy for saying that!  Kuruneko For Sure wanted to have some Tri-Love. The drawing said it from the start and there were hints of like for the both of them.  And I Guess I got my good ending too. But.....2 is Always better than one.
Oreimo,1ycvtq,Cherry_Venus,3,Wed Feb 19 17:44:24 2014 UTC,"her confrontation with ayase said it plainly for me. she accepted kiririns pull on kyousuke and asked ayase if she could say the same! and having the drawing, and the clarification drawing, it was just so... perfectly possible. another time was when kuroneko made it clear she wasnt wanting to exclude kiririn when kiririn walked in on her and kyousuke on the computer in his bedroom. it made it clear she wanted to include kiririn!   i feel like there was also some indication that kuroneko was on a whole different level about the relationships, as if she was suggesting a very adult solution and situation, and kyousuke and kiririn couldnt see it because they werent mature enough to think about such a possibility actually working. do you know of any animes where a triad like that actually works out?"
Oreimo,1ycvtq,-Niernen,0,Wed Feb 19 17:50:26 2014 UTC,"Exactly. I think she was even hinting at a 4-way every now and then. It was probably her anime that got her into that stuff.  Sadly every anime that Isn't 18+ you will get the ""The naughty stuff is there. You just gotta think about it yourself"".  But the Harem(Multi-Girls) is also in:   Shuffle Rosario + Vampire My Mental Choices are Completely Interfering with my School Romantic Comedy   Those are the few off my head that I watch monthly over and over.  All of them end with ""LOL he chose one girl Suck it!"" But then the very ending scene always has them all over him saying they'll still ""Fight"" for him."

Oreimo,1y7mo9,Aerakin,4,Tue Feb 18 05:45:30 2014 UTC,"Unfortunatly, mainstream LN and anime can not do true incest since it is a major social taboo in most areas. Anime and LN is mostly aimed at kids, and laws in Japan forbid incest material for children. Incest material would automatically become 18+, so it is generally avoided. Only already mature or questionable media would go true incest."
Oreimo,1y7mo9,Cherry_Venus,3,Tue Feb 18 06:45:13 2014 UTC,It's going to have a reverse deus ex machina near to end: they're actually 100% blood related.  =P

But seriously though, it's a non canon story that takes place after Season 1, the stories are enjoyable regardless of whether they are canon or not.  While it's true that you won't enjoy every single route, you will definitely find some enjoyment out of your favourite girl or even some unexpected ones (e.g. Kanako)  [Edit] Don't take my word for it though, since it is obviously biased.  By the way, the non blood related route is an IF route, which is a What If story that is even more non canon than the games already are. Kirino is still blood related to Kyousuke in the main route of the first game and other routes of the second."

Speaking of Haruhi: I've been reading the Oreimo light novels lately and, at least to me, they give a pretty different impression of the main characters than the anime and at times Kirino actually reminds me of Haruhi: when Kirino and Kyousuke are together, Kirino often completely disregards Kyousuke and it's like she doesn't even hear what he says, just like Haruhi often does."
Oreimo,1xrsi3,-Niernen,2,Thu Feb 13 04:49:01 2014 UTC,"I just started re-reading the light novels, and while I have don't know much about Haruhi (have not read the novels or watched the anime yet), I would have to agree. The way she treats Kyousuke at the beginning is much harsher than later on, and I forgot about it. She really seems to despise him, and he wants nothing to do with her, preferring to live a ""normal"" life.  More on topic, I remember seeing some of these on Facebook yesterday. Can't really see Kyouske doing this for one reason, his dad would kill him if he saw it.  He does become more carefree near the end of the series, this is almost like their reactions to the final kiss in Akiba."

Oreimo,1xptrv,sirbob6,8,Wed Feb 12 16:53:23 2014 UTC,Similar threads pop up quite a bit. Here's a successful example.
Oreimo,1xptrv,KumoNoAima,3,Wed Feb 12 20:44:59 2014 UTC,"Meanwhile my sister only browses /cm/ (and /y/ occasionally, although she tried to deny that for a while)..."
Oreimo,1xptrv,sirbob6,4,Thu Feb 13 04:18:32 2014 UTC,I know our suffering... There's nothing more awkward than walking in on her browsing /y/.
Oreimo,1xptrv,KumoNoAima,3,Thu Feb 13 04:34:05 2014 UTC,"Awkward? Not really, just makes me roll my eyes in that ""that again?"" way. I guess she feels the same when I'm watching something like Kiniro Mosaic or browsing /r/awwnime -- or especially if she'd see me watch Sakura Trick :D"
Oreimo,1xptrv,sirbob6,4,Thu Feb 13 04:54:48 2014 UTC,"Well, its sorta awkward when something along these lines happen."
Oreimo,1xptrv,KumoNoAima,2,Thu Feb 13 05:15:18 2014 UTC,"Oh, Kiss x Sis! :D That's the sister voiced by Taketatsu Ayana, right?  Yes, that would be awkward. Made me think of this gif."
Oreimo,1xptrv,WillyTheWackyWizard,6,Thu Feb 13 05:28:53 2014 UTC,Its more-or-less common.   I think one guy recorded his.
Oreimo,1xptrv,OniiChanisMyHusbando,2,Wed Feb 12 19:32:10 2014 UTC,hahaha I wish onii-chans would hug each other and post results :(
Oreimo,1xptrv,Cherry_Venus,3,Wed Feb 12 18:59:46 2014 UTC,How do you have 2 onii-chans hugging each other? Doesn't one have to be the younger brother?
Oreimo,1xptrv,OniiChanisMyHusbando,2,Thu Feb 13 21:07:02 2014 UTC,Would still be hot if they were the same age :3 Eep
Oreimo,1xptrv,kiririno,2,Thu Feb 13 22:45:05 2014 UTC,They can both be onii-chans to their imouto.
Oreimo,1xptrv,-Niernen,4,Fri Feb 14 01:40:03 2014 UTC,What does brothers hugging each other have to do with hugging your sister?
Oreimo,1xptrv,OniiChanisMyHusbando,3,Wed Feb 12 19:57:18 2014 UTC,that I wish the anime world had more of it.
Oreimo,1xptrv,-Niernen,3,Wed Feb 12 20:13:04 2014 UTC,I guess the amount of bother couples in anime would be lacking compared to the amount of brother-sister or sister couples.
Oreimo,1xptrv,Cherry_Venus,4,Thu Feb 13 05:45:54 2014 UTC,there are animes with more than 1 male character?
Oreimo,1xp753,GFrohman,6,Wed Feb 12 10:53:23 2014 UTC,"It's the Voice actors,  Talking in-character,  Out-of-character,  About the things their characters do in the anime.  It's hard to comprehend, but amazingly entertaining.  A few more links:  Kyousuke being too honest  Kyosuke tells Kirino that he only agreed to keep her secret on a whim  His response"
Oreimo,1xp753,Histy,6,Wed Feb 12 10:54:10 2014 UTC,I loved when Kirino did that interview with Ayana Taketatsu.  She was basically interviewing herself.
Oreimo,1xp753,KumoNoAima,3,Wed Feb 12 13:29:27 2014 UTC,"oh man, that was when I lost it.  I just gave up trying to make sense of it at that point, my brain just couldn't handle it."
Oreimo,1xp753,Neelo16,3,Wed Feb 12 13:30:25 2014 UTC,"Not just that, but Kirino was being her (slightly) creepy self: I think she said something about wanting to lick her (Ayana)... The voice actresses must have had really fun with that :D"
Oreimo,1xp753,Neelo16,2,Thu Feb 13 04:57:24 2014 UTC,So umm... can I have this link? I looked everywhere and couldn't find it myself :(
Oreimo,1xp753,Neelo16,2,Wed Feb 12 12:26:15 2014 UTC,"I can write how I downloaded it here if you'd like, but it was actually quite complicated. I ended up having to download the show, the sub tracks, a special program used to put them together, then google how to use the program.  There has to be an easier way."
Oreimo,1xp753,Timae09,3,Wed Feb 12 13:32:45 2014 UTC,"Oh, I should be able to put them together if I have the separate files, as I've done it for other stuff as well, so it's fine. I don't know if there is an easier way, the only subs I could find were in malaysian. If you could give me those links, I'm sure I could do it, and I'd be forever grateful to you. Here, have a gift in advance to show my gratitude."
Oreimo,1xp753,KumoNoAima,3,Wed Feb 12 13:54:35 2014 UTC,"Very well then.  I downloaded this for the Commentary episodes, and just skipped the episodes I already had of the show.  Then, I downloaded this for the sub tracks.  But the version of Xdelta3 packaged with the sub tracks is outdated, so I had to download a newer version from here, replace the old one with it, then ran the program to add the sub tracks to the original episodes."
Oreimo,1xp753,-Niernen,2,Wed Feb 12 14:00:43 2014 UTC,I love you. You have no idea how long I've been wanting to watch it! Thanks!
Oreimo,1xp753,Mackdaddyj94,3,Wed Feb 12 14:05:22 2014 UTC,"Ditto for me. I was elated when I finally found it, only to be heartbroken when I found out it lacked sub tracks, only to be elated again when I found the sub track patch, only to be heartbroken again when I found out it didn't work......  Only to be elated again when I fixed it to make it work!  I really wanted these episodes!"
Oreimo,1xp753,-Niernen,2,Wed Feb 12 14:09:23 2014 UTC,I finally got it to work you are so amazing!!! <3
Oreimo,1xoioq,sirbob6,4,Wed Feb 12 04:22:59 2014 UTC,"A translation of the 2ch Kirino doujin that /a/ and /c/ put together, I'm not claiming any responsibility for this, I just thought you guys would enjoy this.  The README text for some clarity:  The /Alternate/ folder is for works of art not by the main author of these fan images, our team translated all but two of them. The kissing panels with Kyousuke and Kirino (and their dolls) was not by us. We included it anyway since it's cute. Deal with it. The main author does not have a Pixiv, it seems. If you find one, let us know, we'll add it. I wish he did have one! Have the next best thing for now, an upload dump of his works: http://ux.getuploader.com/anisen_2/  Featured Authors Pixiv: http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=415964    The /Leveled/ folder contains images made a little darker (such as pencil drawings) to help visibility and stuff. We decided to not level the main images after all and just made alternates for your enjoyment.    This is an /a/ and /c/ production! Nobody takes credit, go away!"
Oreimo,1xoioq,-Niernen,2,Wed Feb 12 04:25:36 2014 UTC,Thanks for uploading this for us!
Oreimo,1xoioq,DinTwo,3,Wed Feb 12 05:16:51 2014 UTC,"Maybe we can use this as an opportunity to see if anyone's interested in translating some of the ~90 untranslated images.   I'll take care of the typesetting if anyone's willing to sink some time into writing up detailed translations for us.   I'd like to start with this recent short, so use that as a sample of the sort of handwriting that needs to be interpreted."
Oreimo,1xoioq,-Niernen,2,Wed Feb 12 05:17:31 2014 UTC,"Oh my god... pages 4-7. Yes.   Unfortunately, to only person I know that is learning Japanese only knows how to speak it and is still learning how to read/write. Hopefully we can find someone that can TL it eventually."
Oreimo,1xoioq,sagrado_corazon,2,Wed Feb 12 05:27:28 2014 UTC,I'd love to help but I'm basically illiterate in Japanese.

This is a picture you took right? Because if you don't have the magazine or better pictures, there is not much you can translate from this."
Oreimo,1xntvj,-Niernen,2,Wed Feb 12 00:23:00 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I bought it to read about the ending. But I don't know much Japanese (Seeing how English is my 2nd already, and German being my first) but I am going to give it my best for you guys! :)"
Oreimo,1xntvj,-Niernen,2,Wed Feb 12 00:26:17 2014 UTC,"Oh that's cool. My friend is learning Japanese now (I was never good with learning languages unfortunately), I we keep talking about stuff we could translate. Have you ever thought about translating (SFW) doujins when you understand Japanese better?"
Oreimo,1xntvj,washunter,1 point,Wed Feb 12 00:31:58 2014 UTC,"To be honest, I really wanted to do that just so others could enjoy anime that isn't translated in english. I will be attending school in the U.S. in 2 years for Japanese for personal use."

Oreimo,1xnu56,-Niernen,1 point,Wed Feb 12 00:21:02 2014 UTC,Seems like this is directed at me somehow... hmm...
Oreimo,1xnu56,Chieft0bi,2,Wed Feb 12 00:23:57 2014 UTC,"No, it was actually direct more at /u/i_hope_we_both_die, who posted part of an actual porno. Plenty of hentai or hentai related pics pop up from time to time here. I was surpised to find out that picture was from a hentai game.   I just don't want to see this sub filled with adult things, there are other websites for that. It is bad when people knowingly post it, but it is even worse when they don't know what they post, because if someone looks for an actual source they may stumble upon hentai/porn. The important part is to know what you post, because then you could warn people."
Oreimo,1xnu56,Chieft0bi,1 point,Wed Feb 12 00:30:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah, Google searching Kirino is not a good idea :P"
Oreimo,1xnu56,KumoNoAima,1 point,Wed Feb 12 00:37:22 2014 UTC,I was about to say what is the worst that could happen if I just searched Kirino... welp. Not that bad compared to some other searchs though.
Oreimo,1xogwk,sirbob6,4,Wed Feb 12 04:03:49 2014 UTC,"Just watched the Oreimo part of that review, I really need to find that ""Your tears are delicious"" gif. And clearly Wincest is the best."

Oreimo,1xmkmi,kiririno,7,Tue Feb 11 19:01:31 2014 UTC,It's actually a video file instead of a playable VN.

Oreimo,1xj5pv,AvalonBright,8,Mon Feb 10 18:04:36 2014 UTC,I wish anime advertisements were done over here. :( Pizza Hut does sooo many campaigns.
Oreimo,1xj5pv,-Niernen,7,Mon Feb 10 20:06:38 2014 UTC,Market and Cultures are different. They actually remove most references with Pizza Slice or something similar.
Oreimo,1xj5pv,PikKirby,7,Tue Feb 11 01:19:37 2014 UTC,ITT: My country sucks. Moving to Japan.
Oreimo,1xj5pv,-Niernen,6,Mon Feb 10 23:49:49 2014 UTC,You mean Akihabara right?
Oreimo,1xj5pv,PikKirby,3,Tue Feb 11 05:05:46 2014 UTC,You don't have to just be in Tokyo to enjoy the anime friendly culture of Nippon~
Oreimo,1xj5pv,-Niernen,3,Tue Feb 11 05:23:54 2014 UTC,But it is oh so much easier.
Oreimo,1xj5pv,-Niernen,7,Tue Feb 11 05:27:51 2014 UTC,"Pizza Hut does a ton of anime advertising. It often gets removed if the show comes overseas, but they do a ton of anime advertising.  Just check out TV trope's page on product placement for anime and manga. Shows up in at least 6 shows, and quite heavily in some, showing up in nearly every episode.   Just googleing pizza hut anime advertising will get you many different shows."
Oreimo,1xj5pv,ValyouTheDastardly,5,Mon Feb 10 18:03:19 2014 UTC,"I just realized something after looking at this for a second.   If there was some hypothetical incest-y show in America and some American fast food chain had featured it in advertisements and such, that there'd probably be some screaming contests among moral guardians and watchdogs and such, not just because of it being some incesty show, but because some American fast food chain is affiliating itself with it.  Yep, the instant I can leave this crap-ass country (or planet!!) I will."
Oreimo,1xj5pv,kiririno,2,Tue Feb 11 22:09:13 2014 UTC,"It's not advertising, but as you can see in the comments of this article, some people will throw a fit over anything the slightest bit incestuous.  https://www.vocativ.com/01-2014/americas-incest-obsession-flowers-attic-back-memories/"
Oreimo,1xj5pv,ValyouTheDastardly,2,Tue Feb 11 23:23:21 2014 UTC,"I never really said anything about product placement, just the fact that this hypothetical fast food chain would affiliate themselves with a hypothetical incestuous show."
Oreimo,1xj5pv,kiririno,2,Tue Feb 11 23:36:53 2014 UTC,"Whoops, I meant to say advertising."
Oreimo,1xj5pv,WillyTheWackyWizard,3,Wed Feb 12 00:00:59 2014 UTC,Do they draw new pictures for the ads or do they just reuse old pictures?
Oreimo,1xjb6f,KirinoMyWaifu,5,Mon Feb 10 18:10:10 2014 UTC,"You will probably have to buy it second hand, sold out amazingly fast everywhere. It was too expensive for me at the time so I missed it too.   Yeah, just checked all the stores I know and it is sold out. Some say they will be resotcked or take more orders around March, so you may have to wait until then, sorry."
Oreimo,1xjb6f,-Niernen,3,Mon Feb 10 18:25:42 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I expected.   I pray that someone will sell theirs unopened in a while, but I doubt it. Lets hope that they restock, that'd be great.   It's a pain in the ass, I can afford it, it's just that they won't ship it to me, brilliant.   Anyway, thanks for the reply."

Oreimo,1xi2wl,Potatomesh,6,Mon Feb 10 06:52:53 2014 UTC,"Cool story time.  tl;dr Katawa Shoujo got me into anime.  What got me into anime wasn't an anime at all.  It was a visual novel called Katawa Shoujo.  I always saw general threads about it on a site I spent a lot of time on and never thought anything of it.  Then I found out it's free and thought ""I like free"" so I downloaded it and started playing.  I was overcome with emotions I had never felt before and sought more of that feeling.  Which is when I went looking for romance anime and somehow I ended up finding Chuu2 on a random streaming site and marathoned it in one day.  That was the first anime I actually watched (not counting dbz which was previously all I'd seen) and ever since then I've been pretty heavy on anime.  But this is an oreimo sub.  And the story on that is shorter.  Back it august 2013, I kept seeing the english name on the site where I used to stream, and one night acted like I clicked on it by accident (mostly to try to convince myself I didn't just choose to watch My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute when I have a little sister of my own)."
Oreimo,1xi2wl,kirinobestgirl,2,Mon Feb 10 08:03:12 2014 UTC,"Nice story dude, really enjoyable read.  And ahaha, I know exactly what you mean when you ""accidently"" click on a tab, I do that at times.  I probably need to play my copy of Katawa Shoujo, it's been sitting on my computer longer than it should have."
Oreimo,1xi2wl,PikKirby,3,Mon Feb 10 09:29:39 2014 UTC,"I come from South Korea, there ""Anime"" is just called cartoons; so very naturally did I slide into otakusim."
Oreimo,1xi2wl,AlienVII,3,Mon Feb 10 08:09:51 2014 UTC,Well I watched anime here and there throughout my whole life basically it was all the mainstream stuff you're talking about. But because of this one post I just happened to see on /r/anime on the front page (funniest moments in your favorite anime or something like that) and someone posted a clip from Angel Beats. So I went and watched that all in a day and LOVED it. Then I asked /r/anime what other anime is like that. Then someone suggested Clannad. I didn't even look up the summary and they didn't even describe it or anything. I just watched it and fell in love with that. Then I went out hunting for anime like that and all and that's how I am where I am today. This all started in late December I think too.
Oreimo,1xi2wl,neobra,2,Mon Feb 10 08:29:48 2014 UTC,"Well, you are not too far of from where I started, it was all mainstream for me until I think last August-October, I can't remember which month it was, but I fell in love with something I should have a long time ago."
Oreimo,1xi2wl,-Niernen,3,Mon Feb 10 09:32:22 2014 UTC,"I guess my very first real anime were Sailor Moon and Dragonball Z. Those two were the only anime running on television when I was really young, so it all started with those. After them it was time for Pokémon/Digimon etc. After I bought my own computer and stuff back in 2006 I really started to watch different shows that the television had to offer. And after that it has all been a glorious road of tears, happiness and overall ""feels"" while watching different series. And you could say that anime has been a saving grace for me, while watching different series I could escape my harsh reality and I could deal with things through them (being bullied, depression, ...). I really believe that discovering anime and all the wonderful series I've watched so far, has saved my life."
Oreimo,1xi2wl,Theunamedplayer,2,Mon Feb 10 10:48:13 2014 UTC,I agree with you so much.  Anime really saved me from doing anything to rash when I was a depressed person.
Oreimo,1xi2wl,ValyouTheDastardly,3,Mon Feb 10 20:12:48 2014 UTC,"January 2013, I'm the only kid with an unlimited internet package in class, one of my friends told me to download SAO for him. I started watching it one day when I'm bored and BOOM! I'm a weeb for the next 6 months :P    Extra note: I found oreimo back in 2011/12(i'm not sure) when I was looking for... porn. That was back in the days when I often browsed wikipedia for that.. I started watching the anime on my weeb period.."
Oreimo,1xhbbp,trambe25,9,Mon Feb 10 01:28:48 2014 UTC,why can't I stop watching this   Because greatest love story ever told.
Oreimo,1xhbbp,kirinobestgirl,3,Mon Feb 10 03:05:00 2014 UTC,i must admit it's quite a change from all those other love stories
Oreimo,1xhbbp,kirinobestgirl,6,Mon Feb 10 03:27:59 2014 UTC,"It's the incest.  At least it is for me.  Oreimo got me looking for other tales of forbidden love.  Some were great, some I didn't care for at all, but nothing comes close to Oreimo."
Oreimo,1xhbbp,-Niernen,2,Mon Feb 10 03:39:37 2014 UTC,"Well, most stories that go full incest end up getting axed or are short to begin with. Oreimo showed the path to incest (that sounds so wrong). It was not just the incest itself, but the road that led there, which was something new. Of course, once it approached the line and tried to cross it, the publishers swooped in and fucked it all up. God Damn it. At least I have my doujins."
Oreimo,1xhbbp,kirinobestgirl,2,Tue Feb 11 01:25:47 2014 UTC,"What I mostly see happen is they pull the ""not blood related"" card somewhere along the line.  OniAi and Akane iro ni somaru saka waited until the last few seconds to come clean and despite liking both, waiting that long to say something really bugged me."
Oreimo,1xhbbp,-Niernen,1 point,Tue Feb 11 03:24:57 2014 UTC,"Yeah, not blood related, you were adopted before you can remember, we are distantly related, crap like that usually gets fans mad, unless it is stated at the beginning, pulling it out later so you can stick them together in a (more) socially acceptable way pisses off fans.  Taken from volume 12:   “However, in the end, because they are brother and sister, marriage is extremely difficult. So there is a development that after they confess and marry, they find out that ‘they aren’t actually blood related’.” The biggest problem disappeared. Congratulations, congratulations. “This rarely happens in eroge. Because the player will get angry.” “Angry?” “Very angry. Sometimes an idiot will even break the disk.” Otakus are so scary! “Two years ago, I saw an anime on TV that had the exact development that you just said. Bah, although the main story wasn't about ‘sibling' love, so it was okay. But recently the industry has been rejecting those ‘stepsister ending’ tendencies. If they are not blood related, it should be made clear from the beginning that they are not blood related."" “I’m slowly failing to understand what you are saying.” Your nature is coming back. “In the end, in a little sister based story, if it’s the real imouto then writing the ending would be very hard.”   In the 12th volume, Kyouske pokes fun at authors and narrators that do this:   If I told my story like that, then that means I lost my right as a narrator. It’s the same level of a lying narrator."

Oreimo,1xhbbp,warhawkguy,3,Mon Feb 10 04:58:30 2014 UTC,I was just about to restart myself. Can't wait to rewatch it all over again :)
Oreimo,1xhbbp,warhawkguy,3,Mon Feb 10 01:31:37 2014 UTC,what's your opinion on the ending? i heard some people had mixed feeling for it
Oreimo,1xhbbp,warhawkguy,6,Mon Feb 10 02:34:34 2014 UTC,"I enjoyed it, though I felt it was rushed a bit. I wanted some closure after all the confessions and teary moments.   I know a lot of people didn't like it cause their ""girl"" didn't win."
Oreimo,1xhbbp,-Niernen,6,Mon Feb 10 03:02:22 2014 UTC,fuk it team kirino all the way
Oreimo,1xhbbp,Potatomesh,3,Mon Feb 10 03:26:42 2014 UTC,On board with you there
Oreimo,1xhbbp,Oldalf,4,Mon Feb 10 03:30:09 2014 UTC,"The publishers interfered, which rarely has good results. Many people felt there was not much closure and were upset he Kyousuke did not end up with any girl. After reading the LN and hearing the authors reasons I understand why he did what he did, but I was still upset initially."
Oreimo,1xdkgq,KirinoMyWaifu,5,Sat Feb 8 19:49:55 2014 UTC,"I mean, I could post some fan art and doujins, but I don't know if everyone wants that. There are probably plenty of discussion topics, especially from the LN. Guess I may star some every once in a while when I get the time. Maybe we could have weekly discussion threads on the LN? I have to finish finding art for Valentines too :P."
Oreimo,1xdkgq,-Niernen,3,Sat Feb 8 23:01:49 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't mind seeing fan art either. Some doujins would be really nice, I'm pretty sure I've read them all though already, still, links to them for others would be good."
Oreimo,1xdkgq,sirbob6,2,Sun Feb 9 00:32:47 2014 UTC,"Have you seen the 2ch Kirino series/doujin yet? It's all extremely cute, if a bit sketchy in parts, and most of it has been translated (there's over a hundred pictures)."
Oreimo,1xdkgq,sirbob6,1 point,Sun Feb 9 21:00:17 2014 UTC,"Ah! I've seen separate images of them floating about, they look great. Do you have a link to a site containing them?"

I mostly have (good) fan art, a few vectors, some screenshots and compiles, half are gifs, and I have a few translated doujins, but I don't think I have them in their entirety."

Oreimo,1xdkgq,sirbob6,3,Sun Feb 9 04:48:06 2014 UTC,"I have a dropbox folder, but it's not much.  Mostly because it's everything that's not a gif since they're either blinking gifs or rips from random episodes and not that exciting.  There's a few dupes and some NSFW stuff, but I try to keep both out."
Oreimo,1xdkgq,-Niernen,3,Sun Feb 9 07:48:35 2014 UTC,"I'm usually on the lookout for videos that I haven't seen posted here, or have seen myself. And with what Nieren said, fan art would be great."
Oreimo,1xdkgq,sagrado_corazon,3,Sat Feb 8 23:34:55 2014 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, what does everyone want posted here? If people want discussion based posts, I have a lot of great pastebin bookmarks and infographs from /a/ threads."
Oreimo,1xdkgq,johhet,3,Sun Feb 9 00:17:21 2014 UTC,"Try starting a discussion thread with any of those ideas you find interesting. I guess we could judge how interested people are after a few of them. I never take the time to type any out, but I will try to later, after re-reading the LN."
Oreimo,1xeupx,kiririno,15,Sun Feb 9 04:49:18 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, yes I don't like how it is not symmetrical.   I saw an edit where they removed her nose and replaced it with a tiny version of her mouth, that was funny.  If anyone has a copy of it, send it my way please!"

Oreimo,1x0kfm,-Niernen,5,Wed Feb 5 00:30:40 2014 UTC,Would've been worth the broken nose.
Oreimo,1x0kfm,KirinoMyWaifu,3,Wed Feb 5 00:48:51 2014 UTC,I don't know if breaking his nose is humanly possible. Seeing how he can withstand Ayase's super sonic kicks.

Oreimo,1wz247,PandaStyle,1 point,Tue Feb 4 19:24:31 2014 UTC,"Beach Queens are so nice, but the 1/10th size doesn't really look as nice when standing near all the larger scale figures. They seem to be somewhere in the middle of figmas and regular prize figurines. I kind of wish they had these in a larger scale."
Oreimo,1wz247,Histy,1 point,Wed Feb 5 12:10:56 2014 UTC,"Oh, I somehow missed the 1/10.That would explain why they are relatively cheaper ~$50ish. I agree they would look much nicer as 1/8 like most others, but the detail is still pretty good. I guess the good thing about the cheaper price is you could pick all 3 up for around $150."

Oreimo,1wx6hp,-Niernen,8,Mon Feb 3 21:43:52 2014 UTC,"Just to let you guys know... that is not the S2 complete box set. That is simply a storage box for all 8 volumes of S2.  If anyone tries to buy it, please don't be surprised when you spend over 5000 yen and receive a hollow box!  These types of promotions are quite popular in Japan: buy all 8 volumes at some discounted rate (still excessively overpriced by non-Japanese standards), and get a limited, exclusive storage box for all of them!  Let's compare:  This is what S1's complete boxset looks like.  Compare to this blog post showcasing the equivalent for S1's all-volume storage box.  So, generally speaking:   All volumes+storage box = more bonus goodies, generally higher-quality encoding of each episode, much more expensive... and no English subtitles whatsover Complete season boxset will strip all physical bonus goods, compress same content into fewer discs, will be cheaper than buying all volumes separately, and did include English subtitles for S1   Aniplex will very likely release the complete S2 boxset in the coming months, which will very likely have English subs and be made available through Aniplex USA."
Oreimo,1wx6hp,onigkkwgn,1 point,Tue Feb 4 04:30:36 2014 UTC,"Oh, thanks for the info, Google Translate didt help much. The bonus artwork is nice, but not worth that much IMO. Although that S1 box does look nice, a maid Kuroneko with striped /r/ZettaiRyouiki"
Oreimo,1wx6hp,kirinobestgirl,1 point,Tue Feb 4 05:51:16 2014 UTC,"No worries. To clarify, the OP link points to various bonuses that people pre-ordering or buying the DVD/blu-ray volumes will receive. Said bonuses vary by retailer in Japan, as well as what exactly is purchased."
Oreimo,1wx6hp,-Niernen,5,Tue Feb 4 06:18:57 2014 UTC,"I'm fairly new to anime, having been the type to say it's all shit until about a year ago.  But from what I've learned, a good bit of anime doesn't get mass produced in japan.  Owning it is based entirely on preorders placed while the series is airing.  You can hope to buy any leftovers, or through auctions as mentioned earlier ITT, but they will always be really expensive if you get lucky enough to find it."
Oreimo,1wx6hp,sirbob6,2,Mon Feb 3 21:39:10 2014 UTC,"True, thanks for the help."

Oreimo,1wtxc3,washunter,2,Sun Feb 2 21:17:44 2014 UTC,"Because it's a Kigurumi.  The real nature of whoever that's inside is unknown, therefore there's a question mark."

Oreimo,1wl92f,AvalonBright,5,Thu Jan 30 22:50:25 2014 UTC,I got a funny look from somebody that saw me watching this on the bus.
Oreimo,1wl92f,kiririno,5,Fri Jan 31 00:52:52 2014 UTC,"Probably. But there's nobody I know on the bus I ride, so I don't really care if somebody sees. I do try to keep it semi-discreet, but this person leaned over my shoulder to see what I was watching."
Oreimo,1wl92f,kiririno,10,Fri Jan 31 01:01:32 2014 UTC,Well that is not creepy at all. But I would avoid watching ecchi anime in public.
Oreimo,1wl92f,-Niernen,8,Fri Jan 31 01:42:39 2014 UTC,But what if I want to watch Kiss x Sis but don't have enough time at home?
Oreimo,1wl92f,Jns112,6,Fri Jan 31 02:31:29 2014 UTC,"Then watch it late at night? Or sit in the back if possible? Honestly, ecchi to hentai anime will get strange looks in public (well, most anime would in general). Can you imagine someone asking what you are watching and what it is about?   ""Oh yeah, I'm watching a show about a little sister that loves her brother and wants to have sex with him"" Some how I don't see that going over well with most people."

Oreimo,1wl92f,Jns112,2,Fri Jan 31 04:07:05 2014 UTC,"If you are watching ecchi or worse (or some might say better :P), people will not even want to ask. The guy on the bus moved several seats away from me after he saw."

Oreimo,1wl92f,Henry132,2,Fri Jan 31 21:27:04 2014 UTC,"I'm totally with you. I watched anime all the time on the subway when I lived in NYC.  Try to be discreet, but if they are leaning in to see stuff, then they might see something they don't want to.  Not that there isn't real life stuff just as bad floating around down in them subways anyway lol."

Oreimo,1wl92f,kirinobestgirl,2,Fri Jan 31 10:04:15 2014 UTC,Are we saying this because she looks like Kuroneko? They are not really  in that similar of positions.
Oreimo,1wl92f,-Niernen,2,Thu Jan 30 23:43:06 2014 UTC,And it's debatable whether it's the Kuroneko-lookalike or the dead girl that is winning.
Oreimo,1wl92f,kiririno,3,Fri Jan 31 16:10:15 2014 UTC,"Well seeing how the other girl is a ghost, I say her chances are somewhat slim."
Oreimo,1wl92f,-Niernen,15,Fri Jan 31 21:23:11 2014 UTC,It's not real incest tho.... Not blood related
Oreimo,1wl92f,brokenbentou,13,Fri Jan 31 21:59:10 2014 UTC,"This show is a little harder to digest than Oreimo, because the relationship between the siblings is being forced by the ghost that haunts the imouto.   In Oreimo, we watch Kyousuke and Kirino slowly repair their relationship and naturally grow to love and adore each other. But in ImoCho, Yuuya is the only one that is willing to step into that position of being Mitsuki's older brother. Mitsuki is still trying to adapt to the new situation of being in a stepfamily, with a new father and older brother she has never had before. If this were the entire series, I feel like it could go the Oreimo route and Mitsuki could learn to be accepting of her new family and Yuuya would become someone she really looks up to and naturally bring out the best of who she can be.  But no, there's a ghost that is obsessed with crossing over to the afterlife and is completely ruining Mitsuki's life and any idea of having a normal functioning relationship with her new older brother, to fuel her own cause. Even I admit, watching Hiyori continually hamper the sibling relationship is downright infuriating. She constantly tries to force Mitsuki out of her comfort zone and ends up embarrassing her at every turn and makes life pretty unbearable. That one plot point feels like the thing that is holding this show back from being an excellent show. I'm still watching because I am interested to see Yuuya and Mitsuki able to kindle a spark together in their relationship, but I don't keep my hopes up."
Oreimo,1wl92f,Histy,5,Fri Jan 31 02:44:15 2014 UTC,"Pretty much summed it up. Would be a much better show if the ghost took a back seat (or was not even there). Kinda reminded me of Golden Time a bit, ghost ruining the life or main characters seems to be gaining popularity.  I could easy watch them form a relation ship to become brother and sister, with or with out incest, but the ghost just forces things too much."

Oreimo,1wl92f,kiririno,5,Mon Feb 3 19:44:25 2014 UTC,"Premise of this show is basically, ""if you don't have sex with your brother you're going to die."""
Oreimo,1wl92f,MasterRiven,3,Sun Feb 2 03:59:21 2014 UTC,"I read the manga before it got licensed. It was okay, seen something similar (w/o the incest) before. I just can't watch it though. The censoring is way over the top, it basically just to get people to buy the uncensored Blu-ray, but it is nothing special. It sounded interesting enough, but i never really got into it. Like someone else mentioned, it is almost boderline hentai at some parts.   The sister looks like Kuroneko."
Oreimo,1wl92f,-Niernen,3,Fri Jan 31 19:22:19 2014 UTC,"Are we talking KissXsis level ""Borderline Hentai""?"
Oreimo,1wl92f,GFrohman,2,Thu Jan 30 22:57:58 2014 UTC,"Very close I would say but not entirely. However, there is alot more censoring."
Oreimo,1wl92f,kuraixsin,3,Thu Jan 30 23:34:32 2014 UTC,"The censoring is just stupid though. They don;t really show much (in the manga at least), but in the anime they stick huge hearts over everything."

Oreimo,1wl92f,kuraixsin,1 point,Fri Jan 31 00:35:31 2014 UTC,ummm because they don't want it to be porn?  Showing watersports and lesbian sex usually counts as porn if they don't want it to be censored
Oreimo,1wl92f,enigmatican,1 point,Fri Jan 31 00:39:38 2014 UTC,D'aww. Then it's totally not worth it.  I guess I'll just have to wait for a Blu-Ray release and download it.
Oreimo,1wl92f,GFrohman,2,Fri Jan 31 07:45:09 2014 UTC,"Haha yes, I'm going to rewatch it when the blu-ray version is released... You know... for science."
Oreimo,1wl92f,kuraixsin,5,Fri Jan 31 00:36:21 2014 UTC,I didn't come to Oreimo for incest. I just watched it after reading a summary for it. I ended up liking Kirino the best and hoped they got together. Also Oreimo is so fucking mild when it even comes to the incest parts compared to this. It's basically hentai. It doesn't even have a decent story when Oreimo had a fantastic one. It also doesn't have any real supporting characters from the first two episodes I saw. I dropped that shit so hard man.
Oreimo,1wl92f,AlienVII,3,Fri Jan 31 00:38:31 2014 UTC,Well its his step sister.So it'll be fine
Oreimo,1wl92f,pierollz,8,Sat Feb 1 19:05:42 2014 UTC,It is not true wincest.
Oreimo,1wl92f,-Niernen,5,Fri Jan 31 01:27:12 2014 UTC,"I wish a sub group took out the ""step"" and never told me so that I could watch in ignorant bliss."
Oreimo,1wl92f,kiririno,4,Fri Jan 31 01:45:44 2014 UTC,"And if you haven't already, go watch the other incest animes - Koi Kaze and Yosuga No Sora."
Oreimo,1wl92f,kiririno,2,Fri Jan 31 01:52:58 2014 UTC,And D.C. Da Capo (first season)
Oreimo,1wl92f,sagrado_corazon,2,Fri Jan 31 01:44:55 2014 UTC,But they aren't actually related.
Oreimo,1wl92f,kiririno,2,Fri Jan 31 02:06:25 2014 UTC,"Same with ImoCho, close enough I guess. Haha"
Oreimo,1wl92f,sagrado_corazon,2,Fri Jan 31 02:24:15 2014 UTC,I didn't really like Koi Kaze that much because of the larger age difference.
Oreimo,1whg9j,KirinoMyWaifu,14,Wed Jan 29 18:39:39 2014 UTC,Stripes :3
Oreimo,1whg9j,MasterRiven,6,Wed Jan 29 19:36:01 2014 UTC,"Congratz on fixing it.  Shame she never cosplayed as Meruru in the anime. And nice pantsu shot. I was wondering if you could she her butt sticking out in the 6-7th picture, and then the 8th one I was like ""Oh... well I guess that works too"" :P   Would it be possible to retake the pictures with better lighting? It's kinda hard to see some of them because it is so dark."
Oreimo,1whg9j,-Niernen,3,Wed Jan 29 18:55:27 2014 UTC,"Sure, I'll take a few more. And I'm glad they're stripped haha, my other Kirino is plain white. Boring. Seeing her cosplay as Meruru, I want a season 3 just for that."
Oreimo,1whg9j,-Niernen,2,Wed Jan 29 21:39:59 2014 UTC,"I was about to say the skirt is really short since her butt is slightly sticking out, then I realized it is probably supposed to be wore by little kids. It really  shows off her modeling body though."
Oreimo,1whg9j,-Niernen,2,Thu Jan 30 03:00:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah,the skirt is actually adjustable. Mines at the standard length.  If you move it, you can see more of her butt, but less of her stomach.  So you can see whatever you want to see."
Oreimo,1whg9j,-Niernen,3,Thu Jan 30 07:04:27 2014 UTC,"That is just wonderful. There's a level for everyone! My friend got an Ayase figure with a removable skirt, needless to say Ayase has been skirtless for a while."
Oreimo,1whg9j,utrocker,2,Thu Jan 30 14:07:57 2014 UTC,"I was considering getting an Ayase figure, but I'm aiming for a complete (minus a few rare prizes) Kirino figure collection first, before I start purchasing any other figures of different characters. I think I'll go for the Memories Ver of Kirino next, again, its very expensive these days, but I might as well get it out of the way."
Oreimo,1whg9j,Chieft0bi,2,Thu Jan 30 21:28:51 2014 UTC,"Oh gosh, I don't really have to money to buy many figure, let alone a collection. But good luck finishing your Kirino collection! Hope you can post some more pictures when ever you get some new ones."

Oreimo,1whg9j,sagrado_corazon,3,Fri Jan 31 00:26:36 2014 UTC,Where did you order this from?
Oreimo,1wgops,-Niernen,3,Wed Jan 29 13:40:02 2014 UTC,For a whole $.8 off ($1.2 for members)! But if anyone was going to buy the blind boxes now would be the time to do it.  Kuroneko figure is also $12 off
Oreimo,1wgops,Shyamallama,1 point,Wed Jan 29 13:40:57 2014 UTC,Just bought 3...I hate shipping to Canada. It's always the majority of the price it seems. Hope I get three Kuronekos! I'd even be fine with just three cat ear ones.
Oreimo,1wgops,Shyamallama,1 point,Wed Jan 29 20:30:47 2014 UTC,"I was about to order 5 for $29, but the shipping is $24 =_= arg i'm so indecisive.... The shipping is almost as much as the figures themselves >.> $4 is not bad for one item, but if you buy them in bulk...."
Oreimo,1wgops,Shyamallama,1 point,Wed Jan 29 22:06:50 2014 UTC,"Well I literally don't have any other Oreimo merchandise(or really any anime merchandise), so I think this is cheap enough and...PG enough to spend some money on.  Although I'm someone who spent $300 on a Fluttershy plushie so maybe I'm not as cheap as I like to think."
Oreimo,1wgops,Shyamallama,2,Wed Jan 29 22:18:20 2014 UTC,"Well, since I don't want to pay for shipping, I found the code for free shipping on orders over $75 (SHINJI75). So i'm going to pick up the Kuroneko figure that is $15 off. Yay for free shipping! (My wallet is still crying).   I can't decide on how many to order. The max I can get is 5, but that puts me over $100 by $5. I don't want to just get one and risk getting a manami >.<"
Oreimo,1wgops,Shyamallama,1 point,Wed Jan 29 22:20:48 2014 UTC,"What? If you get a manami then you just trade it to one of those people for a much better girl, like any of the other ones. Seriously, you should obviously just drop all the money you can on it! And that Kuroneko figurine looks so amazing."
Oreimo,1wgops,Histy,2,Wed Jan 29 22:29:12 2014 UTC,But who wants a manmi? It would be impossible to trade. And my parents probably would get pissed if I drop ~$160 on figures. I think I'll get Kuroneko and 5 mini's and pray I get the good ladies.   edit:My wallet is crying

Only one opinion can be right, so you've got to fight to make your own opinion become fact. You've got to scream Ruri's name to the imaginary sky that exists in the internet and tell every digital person you meet the amazement that Ruri brings. You've gotta make everything you do an action in the name of Ruri, and never let a day go by without worshipping the queen of your world. You've also gotta build the Ruri army with as many people as possible and gain their trust. Then bring the Ruri army to battle against the Kirino army, and it will be a battle that will last many days and many nights, but this Battle of Www.Reddit.com/Oreimo/This_is_a_post_motherfucker/comment/128502716 (I'm on mobile, so I can't see exactly how the URL is formatted) will just be another battle in the ongoing Waifu Wars.

Oreimo,1wa630,Histy,4,Mon Jan 27 15:06:37 2014 UTC,"Where is this from? Looks really similar to the animated commentary but I've only seen season 1. Has season 2 commentary come out?  Kirino seems more suited to Asuna cosplay, based of hair color (and oppai)."
Oreimo,1wa630,-Niernen,2,Mon Jan 27 16:23:11 2014 UTC,"This is from the S2 animated commentaries...  There is a summary of animated commentaries up till Volume 3 here.  What I didn't mention though is that in Volumes 2, 4-7, the animated commentaries make a lot of cross-references with SAO, dubbed ""Dragon Fantasy Online"". It was a short and relatively disconnected piece of info at the time Vol 2 was out, so I didn't put it in the spoilers. However, as you can see, they pulled the reference out quite a lot.  The reason for all this cross-series shenanigans is primarily because Makabe's Voice Actor voices Kirito in SAO.  EDIT: Completely forgot, but as Niernen pointed out, Taketatsu Ayana voices both Kirino and Suguha/Leafa.  The reason Kirino is portrayed as Leafa is because Leafa's an imouto to Kirito (Kyousuke), and they get married in the game for items and bonuses, much to the annoyance of other characters, such as Kuroneko.  I'll write up some more spoilers up till Vol 7 if people want. Vol 8th's bonus features are two gameplay-style videos featuring two played scenarios, each lasting about 22 minutes. I probably can provide general spoilers for those as well, but it'll take longer."
Oreimo,1wa630,onigkkwgn,2,Mon Jan 27 17:29:28 2014 UTC,"Lol that is great, they get married in game... I wonder if they found out about Ethics Code Off. Oh, and I forgot before, but Kirino and Leafa have the same voice actor, so that may also contribute. Does Kuroneko cosplay as any of the characters?"
Oreimo,1wa630,-Niernen,2,Mon Jan 27 17:59:05 2014 UTC,"Thanks for pointing the VA out, edited my post.  Essentially, the following characters are portrayed in-game:   Kyousuke --> Average player with no redeeming features (like Kirito at the start of SAO) Kirino --> Leafa Kuroneko --> Don't think she's any SAO character; looks like herself Makabe --> Blond-haired, loli-loving Kirito Bridget-chan --> Alpha Omega, married to Makabe in-game   There's some backstory as to Makabe being depressed and wasting his life into DFO, skipping school and ignoring real-life. Kuroneko and Kyousuke go in-game to try and bring him out, to no avail. Sena then borrows Kuroneko's character to talk to Makabe to try and convince him to return to reality. It works when she promises to go on a date with him if he comes back.  I'll elaborate more when I have a bit more time."
Oreimo,1wa630,onigkkwgn,2,Mon Jan 27 18:42:04 2014 UTC,Bridget married Makabe? Lucky guy. And seeing DFO made me said that the NA version of DFO shut down >.>  Good think about a game is you can't have kids by accident.

Oreimo,1w9v8e,megustafap,10,Mon Jan 27 12:07:26 2014 UTC,"They were watching Maschera and Kuroneko paused it just before the kiss. Based on what Hinata says after, it seems like she was planning to kiss Kyousuke at this scene, so she took a shower first because she was so nervous (and sweating)."
Oreimo,1w9v8e,Cherry_Venus,3,Mon Jan 27 18:12:47 2014 UTC,"Er, while I don't doubt her and Kirino masterbate (from what is said in the LN), I kinda doubt she was. It was more likely she was pretty nervous, and wanted to get ready in case anything happened later. In the LN, they mention that she asked Kirino if it was okay to give her body to Kyousuke, so if it was not for the fact Kirino got hurt by their relationship it is probably Kyousuke and Kuroneko would have made love."
Oreimo,1w9v8e,-Niernen,3,Mon Jan 27 13:03:35 2014 UTC,"Does she really ask Kirino that?  That must have hurt Kirino a lot, having your best friend try to pull off netorare on you like that."
Oreimo,1w9v8e,Histy,2,Mon Jan 27 15:13:16 2014 UTC,"Uh, its not NTR seeing how Kuroneko was the one dating Kyosuke, and not Kirino.... And Kirino would have probably pulled off NTR if Kuroneko had not let Kyousuke go. But the specific lines, from volume 8:   Kirino mimicked Kuroneko’s voice. “… One of my friends has a problem… If she got a boyfriend… how many dates would be appropriate before >allowing him to take her body?” “Hey, that was my friend’s problem. She asked me for help!” Kuroneko loudly denied. Kirino didn’t stop her attack though. “Really? How about we go ask that friend of yours?” “… That…” Kuroneko’s mouth hung open, unable to say anything back. “It was clearly about you! I even lent you a lover's guide book – 'The spirit of love special edition – How to >hold hands on your first date', and what about the time someone said bravely 'Haha, I'm a pro at dating' but >then later that night that same person said in a depressed tone 'looks like I need to practice holding hands'.”   And seeing how Kuroneko broke up with Kyousuke because she new their relationship was hurting Kirino and she wanted the siblings to work it out, I don't see how she could be considered the NTR type.  Also, seeing how Kuroenko was acting when she left the shower, it is pretty obviously she was not masturbating. And I don't think she would do that when she has Kyousuke over. She couldhave just as easily had sex with him if she was that horny, but she is not that type of girl. It was more along the lines of she was getting ready for the night, take that however you want."
Oreimo,1w9v8e,-Niernen,2,Mon Jan 27 15:20:15 2014 UTC,"Kuroneko normally tells Kyousuke that she loves him as much as his sister, implying that she knows Kirino also has a romantic investment towards Kyousuke.   But she still seems to help Kuroneko from what you have posted, even if it is an emotional struggle as it shows later in their relationship. From what I am understanding, Kuroneko is basically asking Kirino when it is okay to have sex with Kyousuke? So the whole ""you love this person and I am going to take them away"" definition still seems to apply. After the break-up, we learn Kirino would support Kyousuke by standing by his decisions, so I don't think Kirino would be able to pull that off if Kyousuke truly decided he wanted a relationship with Kuroneko."
Oreimo,1w9v8e,Histy,2,Mon Jan 27 15:34:04 2014 UTC,"But it still would not be NTR. Kyousuke is in a relationship with Kuroenko, not Kirino, and Kirino clearly made no moves or conffessions. That would be like saying If you liked you best friend's significant other they are performing NTR on you. While Kirino may love Kyousuke, he does not realize it yet and they are not in a relationship. NTR refers to when you are taking someone else's siginficant other, NTR in this case would be if Kirino slept with Kyousuke, not the other way around. Even if they both love him equally, he is with Kuroneko, not Kirino.  Kuroneko goes to Kirino for emotional help because Kirino is her best and one of her only friends. She doesn't have much other choices besides Saori, but Kirino obviously seems like she would know more about those kinds or relationships (seeing how shy Saori is outside otaku mode). I do think that if Kuroneko never broke up with Kyousuke they would have been happy toghether, but Kirino would probably break inside and might end up destroying her relationship with both of them. I honestly don't know how she would continue to deal with their relationship. She probably would start to ignore them like she did Kyousuke, if she did not emotionally explode. However, on the other hand, if Kyousuke actually new Kirino's true feelings while in a relationship with Kuroneko, it would be possible he dumps her to protect his Imouto. I think that would have probably hurt Kuroneko more than her dumping him, even if they have similar results. Even after she dumps him, she does not give up on Kyousuke until he tells her he can't have a relationship with her because he loves Kirino. Up to that point it was still a possiblity if they sorted out their feelings that Kyousuke would go back to Kirino."
Oreimo,1w9v8e,-Niernen,2,Mon Jan 27 15:48:16 2014 UTC,"While it isn't the correct term for it, I feel like the concept is closest to the situation. I'm not sure if there is an actual term for what happens in the story.  While they are not in a romantic relationship, Kyousuke and Kirino are in an emotionally fragile and demanding relationship, due to reconnecting after their distant lives. Kuroneko is an observer to this as many others are, but she also is aware of Kirino's affection state for Kyousuke and isn't one to miss an opportunity to quip and tease Kirino about her brother complex. The point being that Kuroneko does have an idea and knows her relationship with Kyousuke is going to hurt Kirino. Her struggles with doing what she wants versus doing what Kyousuke wants is one of the more interesting facets of her storyline.  I just thought if Kuroneko was asking Kirino that kind of that, it must have been incredibly awkward with Kirino's emotional state.  As for the OP, I imagined she was in the shower for long due to her nerves, not for any of the other things mentioned in this discussion."
Oreimo,1w9v8e,Histy,2,Mon Jan 27 22:36:42 2014 UTC,I see your point. She really doesn't have anyone else to go to though.
Oreimo,1w9v8e,-Niernen,2,Mon Jan 27 22:45:41 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the discussion. I greatly enjoyed it.  The masturbation part really just was a speculation, but what you said made a lot more sense."
Oreimo,1w9v8e,Histy,4,Tue Jan 28 01:44:09 2014 UTC,"Since -Niernen mentioned the scene, I feel like that anime scene where Kirino misheard and barged into Kyousuke and Kuroneko's time in his room, makes a lot more sense now why she interpreted that way. If Kuroneko was asking Kirino for love advice the way she did, I don't blame Kirino for thinking they were doing the hanky panky loli spanky.   But like Kyousuke, it was her first relationship and probably the first time she has ever brought a boy to her house. When things started getting awkward and she didn't know what to do, I think she tried to escape the situation to try and regroup or hope Kyousuke would fix the situation. But none of that happens and she end up in the shower for a long time, slowly increasing her fear of facing Kyousuke. But that is the Kuroneko we know, she tends to clam up an lose assertiveness when faced with difficult situations that involve things she is inexperienced in."
Oreimo,1w9v8e,-Niernen,2,Tue Jan 28 03:05:30 2014 UTC,"That's quite a few good points you bring up. I wonder what she would have done after the kiss, because i'm guessing they would both be pretty embarrassed. And she did mention they had an appointment or something planned for later, maybe dinner (so she could show off her cooking skills?)? I think it would have been a great scene if her sisters had walked in while they were kissing.   The scene in the bedroom, when they are playing games and Kirino mishears is also... interesting. I wonder how she would have reacted if she had barged in and they were... ""forming a contract"" as Kuroneko would put it. I know there is a doujin (or few) epicting that scene. Of course that could never happen."
Oreimo,1w9v8e,GFrohman,2,Tue Jan 28 04:11:34 2014 UTC,"I agree. It's a shame Kuroneko's sisters came in after she took a shower. It would have been very interesting to see what happens if they weren't.  Btw, this:   I don't blame Kirino for thinking they were doing the hanky panky loli spanky.   Is my new favourite words. Hanky lanky loli spanky."
Oreimo,1w9v8e,GFrohman,1 point,Tue Jan 28 04:00:14 2014 UTC,"A bit late to the party, but I can help explain why it was so awkward:  In Japanese culture, it's customary to shower directly before sex. So much so that if a girl asks you ""should I take a shower?"" She's basically propositioning you.  You can see how that could confuse some people."
Oreimo,1w9v8e,GFrohman,1 point,Sat Feb 1 03:48:03 2014 UTC,Interesting. I didn't know that. So basically she was thinking of sex.
Oreimo,1w9v8e,Fissie,1 point,Sat Feb 1 03:58:42 2014 UTC,"At the very least, she was preparing to do romantic things with him. Kiss, make out, that sort of thing.  I actually found out this societal mannerism the hard way: I was with an exchange student during college, completely missed one of her signals, and accidentally shot her down. I'm not going to tell the whole story here, but it was preeety embarrassing."
Oreimo,1w4xhd,-Niernen,21,Sat Jan 25 19:58:35 2014 UTC,How would I react to Kirino trying to molest me? WHY TEMPT ME WITH SUCH FANTASIES!
Oreimo,1w4xhd,Cherry_Venus,9,Sat Jan 25 21:17:55 2014 UTC,This is a little off topic but there actually was an incident where Kuroneko invited Kirino over along with Kyousuke in the light novels. Sadly this wasn't animated but you know what's gonna happen anyway
Oreimo,1w4xhd,DJLTheFirst,3,Sat Jan 25 21:39:53 2014 UTC,Kyousuke was also noting Tamaki and Hinata's resemblance to the girls in eroge.

Oreimo,1vziiy,Datnero362,19,Thu Jan 23 23:44:38 2014 UTC,"Never had a problem with the incest ending, in fact, it's the only ending I wanted to see.  I would've wanted Kirino to win regardless of whether she was the little sister or best friend to be honest."
Oreimo,1vziiy,sagrado_corazon,6,Thu Jan 23 23:49:22 2014 UTC,"So you were okay with the ending because you were rooting for Kirino, and not because you're cool with incest?"
Oreimo,1vziiy,fallofmanproductions,13,Thu Jan 23 23:57:36 2014 UTC,For me it was both. Now I am not into real incest and all that jazz but I am mostly fine with the fictional kind.
Oreimo,1vziiy,fallofmanproductions,7,Fri Jan 24 00:02:37 2014 UTC,"see, that's something that's been bugging me. I'm totally against irl incest. It's illegal in most places for a reason. But seeing Kirino in that wedding dress was so fucking cute I completely forgot about that. It made me feel weird."
Oreimo,1vziiy,fallofmanproductions,10,Fri Jan 24 00:05:26 2014 UTC,That might be one of the motives of the creator. To set up an anime about incest but gradually make people forget about the incest and look at their love for what it truly is.
Oreimo,1vziiy,Hoogyme,7,Fri Jan 24 00:11:04 2014 UTC,That's definitely something that crossed their mind. It's a forbidden love story for the ages.
Oreimo,1vziiy,Hoogyme,10,Fri Jan 24 00:13:22 2014 UTC,And such a beautiful love story it is.
Oreimo,1vziiy,kiririno,9,Fri Jan 24 00:18:58 2014 UTC,dam shes a qt
Oreimo,1vziiy,sagrado_corazon,3,Fri Jan 24 00:21:55 2014 UTC,"Wedding dress? I watched the series on Crunchyroll, am I missing something here?  Edit: Not going back to Crunchyroll for anything ever again. It ends at S2 E13 so is this the rest?"
Oreimo,1vziiy,pinedoplan2,3,Fri Jan 24 04:39:07 2014 UTC,"Yep, that's the true ending of the show. Watch it. ASAP."
Oreimo,1vziiy,pinedoplan2,3,Fri Jan 24 05:50:07 2014 UTC,"Done. Much better. I still question if in the end it was worth it for him, denying pretty much every girl he knew and ending up still being brother and sister in the end."
Oreimo,1vziiy,-Niernen,4,Fri Jan 24 06:09:11 2014 UTC,"That's a big question that crossed my mind too. He may have alienated most of his close friends (hell, probably alienated) in order to be kissy-buddies with his sister. I'm obviously not Kyousuke, but I wouldn't think I came out on top in his situation."
Oreimo,1vziiy,Histy,2,Fri Jan 24 06:14:09 2014 UTC,That's the nice thing about fiction. You can put whatever you want in there.
Oreimo,1vziiy,-Niernen,6,Fri Jan 24 17:55:34 2014 UTC,"It's just an anime, so incest doesn't bother me, but yeah, I would've rooted for Kirino regardless."
Oreimo,1vziiy,-Niernen,7,Fri Jan 24 00:09:17 2014 UTC,"I wasn't sure what to expect when i was starting this anime, but i enjoyed every second of it. Sure the end is incest but it was a nice story. However i agree with you, Ayase and Kyousuke was in my mind after the whole Kuroneko incident."
Oreimo,1vziiy,-Niernen,6,Fri Jan 24 01:46:09 2014 UTC,"Agreed, I was hoping for KyousukexKuroneko, but after that, I was hoping for KyousukexAyase hardcore.  However, I still enjoy the ending. It was the logical closing point, and even through the whole incest thing, it was fucking cute as all hell. Still can't get over the scene in the hotel room. Goddamn."
Oreimo,1vziiy,-Niernen,3,Fri Jan 24 01:50:15 2014 UTC,"Me neither my friend, and yeah it was cute, no doubt about that. Major respects to Kyousuke."
Oreimo,1vziiy,fallofmanproductions,7,Fri Jan 24 02:16:43 2014 UTC,"Guess I'm late to the party. I wanted Kirino to be with Kyousuke because they both loved each other. While all the other girls dd confess to them, and he did like them (as friends), Kirino was the only one he loved. While I am against incest in real life for the most part, I don't really care too much about it in anime (probably because I read too many doujins). I was disapointed in the end originally till I came her and heard that the author did not have much of a choice originally. Reading the Light Novels also helped a bit, was really great that they were translated on Baka Tsuki. I originally found out about the series while reading doujins (Little Sister Fever warning to be exact), and I liked Kirino's design. My friend kept bugging me to watch anime, and when I checked out Crunchyroll It happened to have an add for Oreimo since the last OVA's had been released. I ended up marathoning the whole series in a few days, and watched the show cause I thought Kirino was cute. I personally would probably go for a character like Kuroneko in real life, but for Kysousuke it had to be Kirino, the whole series was about their relationship."
Oreimo,1vziiy,Histy,3,Fri Jan 24 12:09:13 2014 UTC,"I'd be willing to bet a lot of people learned of this series through doujins lol. I've seen so much Oreimo porn, it's hilarious.  And yeah, I agree. Like I said somewhere else in this thread, just because I would have picked Ayase doesn't mean that Kirino wasn't the best choice for Kyousuke."
Oreimo,1vziiy,Cherry_Venus,4,Fri Jan 24 15:07:16 2014 UTC,Thank goodness for Number2!
Oreimo,1vziiy,Cherry_Venus,5,Fri Jan 24 16:01:28 2014 UTC,"Mh, great style and full color.   There are a few others I would mention but I'm in class right now so I'll update it later."
Oreimo,1vziiy,fallofmanproductions,1 point,Fri Jan 24 16:30:09 2014 UTC,It sounds like there is a pretty wide spread of Oreimo doujins if you guys are mentioning specific artists.
Oreimo,1vziiy,fallofmanproductions,2,Sat Jan 25 00:29:20 2014 UTC,Some good artists or artists that have done multiple Oreimo Doujins are: Ohtsuka Kotora (Love Replica) Pi-ko Nakajima Yuka (Digital Lover) Hyocorou (My Yonger Sister is...) Katsurai Yoshiaki Harukigenia (Little Sister Fever Warning) Oreimo on Pururin
Oreimo,1vziiy,lolwutRNB,1 point,Sat Jan 25 00:37:24 2014 UTC,"Not really into hentai, but those are really well made. Do those guys sell those? Like as physical copies?"
Oreimo,1vziiy,fallofmanproductions,2,Sat Jan 25 00:40:46 2014 UTC,"The physical copies must be bought in Japan or online and they are in Japanese.  Should have been canon, got the emotions correct"
Oreimo,1vziiy,lolwutRNB,1 point,Sat Jan 25 00:44:41 2014 UTC,Must be pretty annoying for the artists who make these. I googled the name of that one and there are dozens of websites with the whole doujin on them.   Also for porn that was pretty cute.  EDIT: aw what the fuck this one is so sad http://www.fakku.net/doujinshi/200-day-war-of-me-and-my-sister-english
Oreimo,1vziiy,kiririno,2,Sat Jan 25 00:48:42 2014 UTC,"I disliked that one, should have mentioned to avoid it. The artist's names were taken from Pururin and are romanized."
Oreimo,1vziiy,-Niernen,5,Sat Jan 25 03:28:56 2014 UTC,Another question: Favorite scene in the entire series.   Mine has to be a tie between meeting Manami's grandparents and when Kyousuke asks Kirino for advice.
Oreimo,1vziiy,Histy,8,Fri Jan 24 01:51:52 2014 UTC,It has to be when Kyousuke stood up for Kirino against their dad. I was still not sure what to make of the anime up to that point but that scene gave me chills and made me really interested in the story.
Oreimo,1vziiy,-Niernen,3,Fri Jan 24 02:07:41 2014 UTC,"""I'll sock you one for her!""  Yeah, that scene was great, it definitely was a good moment for the rest of the series. I love how that dad still figured out that the eroge was Kirino's, but he took Kyousuke's advice and let it slide. Daisuke was a great character."
Oreimo,1vziiy,Histy,3,Fri Jan 24 05:51:58 2014 UTC,"It is a shame they didn't dive into their parents more. At the beginning of the series, Daisuke seemed like a hard-ass, strict father-type and Yoshino was the motherly voice of reason that tolerated the rest of the family's nuisances (to much comedic effect).   But you later learn more about what is hidden under their father's exterior and how much he actually cares about his family and his children. Although I'm not sure how much of their mother's reactions were serious or were crafted to keep the peace, they never really get into it, but hint she is watching over them; although that might be a light novel thing. I kind of wish they licensed the light novels into English, like also-ASCII/Dengeki Bunko's Sword Art Online."
Oreimo,1vziiy,Cherry_Venus,2,Fri Jan 24 13:04:42 2014 UTC,"The light novels are translated on Baka Tsuki, there are links in this thread.  Yeah, I'm still surprised that the father actually gained a third dimension as the show goes on. Most shows would just hold onto the hardass image forever, because that's funny and causes conflict."
Oreimo,1vziiy,secret_otaku,3,Fri Jan 24 15:05:06 2014 UTC,"Just to act like an elitist, I'll pick a scene that only appears in the novels! After Kyousuke and Kirino start dating, they meet Sakurai at the arcade, and Kirino casually introduces herself as Kousaka Kirino, Kyousuke's girlfriend and sister. It's an absolutely hilarious scene, unfortunate that it was cut."
Oreimo,1vziiy,secret_otaku,3,Sat Jan 25 03:46:02 2014 UTC,"Lol I bet! That was another thing that bugged me towards the end of the series. Somebody says that Kirino was going around BRAGGING about her and Kyousuke. I'm surprised she did that, if it was true."
Oreimo,1vziiy,secret_otaku,3,Sat Jan 25 03:55:33 2014 UTC,“I was rejected because you like your little sister! Don’t do this Kousaka! How about we start dating now!?”  A very straightforward request suddenly rushed forward.  “Don’t want to. I love my little sister.”
Oreimo,1vziiy,-Niernen,5,Sat Jan 25 03:56:02 2014 UTC,"Wincest or nothing! But seriously, if the anime ended with anything other than a incest like ending I think that would be going against the core of the story."
Oreimo,1vziiy,Histy,1 point,Thu Jan 23 23:48:54 2014 UTC,"Have you read the manga?  I'm wondering because the transition into Kyousuke admitting his love for Kirino was a little sudden, and I was wondering if they go into that realization a little more in-depthly in the books."
Oreimo,1vziiy,-Niernen,3,Thu Jan 23 23:50:52 2014 UTC,"No, I have only watched the anime as of now. I have not yet begun to explore the other forms of the story.   Edit: If you want the original form of the story you would have to read the light novels."

The game mainly consists of Idol Master Photo Shoot events, where you control a camera and attempt to take the best photos of the characters. There's still interaction between characters, but it's very limited. You play the role as their Manager, so conversations mainly consist of 'This rumour is spearing about me online, fix it'. There's a few CG scenes which are very well drawn, but the majority of the game is the horrible 3D models."

Oreimo,1vwp8j,Blahpoe,1 point,Sun Jan 26 06:25:56 2014 UTC,"What's on the bluray? I heard the game itself was somewhat disappointing. The rest of it looks pretty good though, especially the art book."
Oreimo,1vwp8j,Blahpoe,2,Thu Jan 23 02:50:41 2014 UTC,The blu ray is mostly trailers. But at the very end there's a mini episode that's not exactly... animated? It's made to look like a part in the PSP game. For all I know it could be from it. But Kyousuke and Kirino are stuck in an elevator and it's a lot of dialogue and embarrassment and so on.
Oreimo,1vxaqc,AlienVII,4,Thu Jan 23 06:39:48 2014 UTC,"You can purchase the Blu-Ray boxset which includes Season 1/Season 1 OVAs/Character Commentaries at RightStuf, CDJapan, Amazon Japan, etc.  There is a much cheaper North American DVD release which includes all the Season 1 Episodes and OVAs, also available at RightStuf. Unlike the Blu-Ray version, it does not include the character commentary bonus episodes.  Season 2's volumes are currently being released in Japan and a box set will probably not come until well after that, as mentioned."
Oreimo,1vxaqc,Histy,1 point,Thu Jan 23 09:48:31 2014 UTC,Do I need a Japanese bluray player for it? I'm assuming yes but I want to be sure.
Oreimo,1vxaqc,Histy,1 point,Thu Jan 23 10:12:01 2014 UTC,"It is a Region A/1 Blu-Ray, so it should work in any American or Japanese Blu-Ray player."

Oreimo,1vxaqc,KaleGen,1 point,Thu Jan 23 10:46:29 2014 UTC,As far as I know you won't find a physical copy with official subs.  The best you can do is torrent the blu-ray rips that have been subbed by someone else.  And season 2 blurays aren't even all released yet.  There's still volume 8.
Oreimo,1vxaqc,DIGGYReddit,3,Thu Jan 23 07:16:21 2014 UTC,I just saw the Blu-ray with English subs. You baka.

Oreimo,1vmgf0,Darkendsoul,-1,Mon Jan 20 00:18:43 2014 UTC,Ayase. She's like a less bitchy version of Kirino. She's my favourite since the episodes where she's at kyosuke's appartment.
Oreimo,1vmgf0,deadchris,1 point,Mon Jan 20 06:49:41 2014 UTC,oh ok I really liked Ayase too. I don't know if you've read the light novels but they added some more story with Ayase which made me like her even more

Oreimo,1vi2w9,DosTrojan,1 point,Sat Jan 18 06:21:24 2014 UTC,I think my all time favorite scene (especially in the novels) is Ayase going all psychotic on Kirino when she catches her on the way back from Comiket.  Just checked; it was the beginning of s1e5 (although they started walking home at the end of ep4). And in the novels it was near the end of volume 2.
Oreimo,1vi2w9,Cherry_Venus,10,Sun Jan 19 00:46:54 2014 UTC,"Most of them. It's very hard to pick a favourite, but I really, really liked the last episodes of S2 -- both the sad and the happy parts (for example Kyousuke breaking up with Kuroneko for good was heartbreaking to watch, but I still love that scene almost as much as the wedding with Kirino).  Another of my favourites is the last episode of S1 -- the one where Kyousuke travels to US to get Kirino back. This scene is so amazing..."

Oreimo,1vi2w9,NSA_Approved,3,Sat Jan 18 13:08:02 2014 UTC,"Nope, haven't read them yet."
Oreimo,1vi2w9,Athio,6,Sat Jan 18 14:59:40 2014 UTC,i can't put down an actuall number too and i don't feel like looking it up.  But i'd have to say the episode that shows Kirino and Kyosuke growing up. I liked it alot since it brough Kirino into a whole new light and really showed her deepest motivations and love for Kyosuke.
Oreimo,1vi2w9,Chieftainy,10,Sat Jan 18 05:12:59 2014 UTC,"Season 2, episode 9: Obvious reasons.  And as if my affiliation wasn't obvious enough, the last 4 episodes were all pretty great(for Kirino fans)."

Oreimo,1vi2w9,kirinobestgirl,2,Sat Jan 18 14:51:44 2014 UTC,"As a massive Kirino fan, I'd say that episode is closely my 2nd favourite."

As an Ayase shipper, s2ep12 also has a deep spot in my heart."
Oreimo,1vi2w9,lolwutRNB,2,Sat Jan 18 07:46:09 2014 UTC,"S1 E10, by far, my favorite. Kanako's first cosplay contest, all characters are at their best. Ayase's observation to the demographic, Kirino's reactions to the show is relatable to mine with K-on... I just love this episode."

Oreimo,1vdv5x,timw4mail,2,Thu Jan 16 19:57:21 2014 UTC,"Or, perhaps, a wild guess here, they don't have a handle of Japanese pronunciation or enunciation, and thus, use an assumed way of saying it as someone who speaks English would.  Kind of like how a lot of people seem to say ""Haganai"" as ""hah-ga-nye"", yet the ""ha"" comes from the particle は which is pronounced as a ""wa"" when used as a particle. Thus, it should be ""Waa-ga-nye"".  This is the problem you get when these shows with beyond-long names get shortened, then terribly translated."
Oreimo,1vdv5x,Meeea,8,Thu Jan 16 21:51:43 2014 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, if the word is connected then WA isn't a particle, so ""hah-ga-nye"" is correct."
Oreimo,1vdv5x,Potatomesh,5,Thu Jan 16 22:30:26 2014 UTC,"You are correct.  Particle は and regular use は are pronounced differently.  However, the actual name of the show is 僕は友達が少ない or Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai.  はがない or Hanagai is the shortening of that, taking out the kanji of Boku 僕, Tomodachi 友達, and Suku 少.  Therefore, the は in Haganai is not originally a regular use は, it is a particle.  Therefore, it should be pronounced as Wa."

Oreimo,1vdv5x,gerrettheferrett,0,Thu Jan 16 22:59:40 2014 UTC,I've been told by several of my Japanese friends that it is Waganai.  I'll trust them over an anonymous internet. :)

Oreimo,1vdv5x,AvalonBright,2,Fri Jan 17 07:47:36 2014 UTC,"You're right that it is a particle, but the show is still ""Haganai"", not ""Waganai."" It also wasn't a name given to the show by English speakers either, it's called Haganai in Japan as well. Why? I don't know. But it definitely is."
Oreimo,1vdv5x,Histy,1 point,Thu Jan 16 23:22:21 2014 UTC,"It is a particle when used in the entire title of the show and would be pronounced ""Wa"" when saying something like Boku ""wa"" Tomodachi. But in an abbreviation like Haganai, it is not a particle, so it would read as ""Ha""ganai.  It's probably why it is officially romanized as Haganai(see URL)/Bokuha Tomodachiga Sukunai."
Oreimo,1vdv5x,DIGGYReddit,1 point,Fri Jan 17 02:56:07 2014 UTC,"Without deleting the original comment, the only thing I was trying to get across is that I seem to be coming across more and more people who mention a series (and say it wrong) because it's popular and easy to toss around (as in to sound like they are more involved with anime in general than they truly are). That's why I religiously write it as OreImo instead of Oreimo in order to avoid confusion. My original intent wasn't to hate on people just for saying it differently for a more genuine reason, it was for the 'posers'. In fact, I gave OP benefit of the doubt and upvoted the thread for visibility."
Oreimo,1vdv5x,-Niernen,1 point,Fri Jan 17 12:00:05 2014 UTC,"To be fair, when I first heard of the series, that is how I pronounced it because: 1. There is no way I could ever pronounce the full Japanese title 2. Thats how it looks like it would be pronounced in English.  Once i watched the show and knew a bit more about it I figured out the correct pronunciation, but i'm guessing there are a lot of people out there that never did.   I never watched it because it was popular. I honestly watched it because I found Kirino cute. That and I enjoyed a few doujins so I figured I would check out the show...   But who would try to be a posers and claim to like a show about incest? seems a bit off..."

Oreimo,1vdv5x,SamMee514,2,Fri Jan 17 03:08:36 2014 UTC,Great to hear :D
Oreimo,1vdv5x,-Niernen,11,Fri Jan 17 04:22:14 2014 UTC,"You can remeber, it is a shortening of Ore (no) Imouto, so you would pronounce it like that, Ore-Imo(uto)."
Oreimo,1vdv5x,kuraixsin,9,Fri Jan 17 04:24:35 2014 UTC,"Pretty much, and just to further clarify, it would be something like   (O - reh) - (ee - mo)"
Oreimo,1vdv5x,-Niernen,2,Thu Jan 16 22:14:58 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, NanoDesu has a small pronunciation and other assorted Japanese skills guide  And who would have thought it could cause this much drama?"

Oreimo,1vdv5x,kirinobestgirl,2,Fri Jan 17 12:40:10 2014 UTC,"Keep the vowels separate.  The E sounds like ""eh"" the I sounds like ""ee"" like ""key"".  unless you're japanese, don't worry about the proper ""R"" sound which is sort of like a ""d"" sound."
Oreimo,1vdv5x,XetoFighting,2,Thu Jan 23 00:52:59 2014 UTC,"Saying it's more like a D sound can be misleading.  It's more of an ""R"" and an ""L"" combined."

Oreimo,1v55bm,megustafap,11,Tue Jan 14 03:13:33 2014 UTC,Hmm maybe she doesn't want Kirino to look as hot as she is in front of Kyousuke?
Oreimo,1v55bm,kirinobestgirl,3,Mon Jan 13 23:19:28 2014 UTC,Implying Kirino isn't the hottest without even trying
Oreimo,1v55bm,-Niernen,3,Thu Jan 16 07:11:28 2014 UTC,Pretty sure Kuroneko and Kirino's ideal cosplays would be way different. Just look at some of those pictures of Kirino cosplaying as Meruru...
Oreimo,1v55bm,Andarnio,5,Tue Jan 14 13:32:57 2014 UTC,"S2E3, if anyone's wondering."
Oreimo,1v6dr1,Ahanaf,13,Tue Jan 14 07:23:32 2014 UTC,Sadly the series is over. The writer has started a new project with a similar theme if I recall correctly. I would have to look it up to confirm.  However you could read the light novels to gain a bit of insight as the narration adds a bit of detail that is lost in viewing the anime from a third person perspective. You could also look for the character commentary on the dvd/blu-ray if you just crave more. They have been posted a few times in this sub and shouldn't be too hard to dig up.  Also the novels have a few stories that never were animated. One of them is a fairly big deal and helps flesh out Kyouske's character a bit.
Oreimo,1v6dr1,lynxman89,10,Tue Jan 14 11:17:45 2014 UTC,"You don't get much more correct than this, folks."
Oreimo,1v6dr1,Simplerdayz,5,Tue Jan 14 12:55:23 2014 UTC,"The new series, Eromanga Sensie, came out last December. No translations yet, but the pictures and a few summaries are probably out there. There series is slightly different, this time they are not blood related, among other things. I really hope someone translates it eventually."
Oreimo,1v6dr1,-Niernen,2,Tue Jan 14 18:56:16 2014 UTC,Its been a long time since i felt a void in my heart but it was a great ending.
Oreimo,1v6dr1,lynxman89,1 point,Wed Jan 15 05:08:41 2014 UTC,It's been a long time since a series meant so much to me. In the end I just wanted Kirino and Kyouske to be happy. Their situation reflected one in my own life very closely. Just without the incest. Analyzing everything at the end I was satisfied with the way it ended.
Oreimo,1v6dr1,-Niernen,6,Wed Jan 15 10:09:20 2014 UTC,"Read the Light novels, they are translated on Baka Tsuki. The anime leaves out large portions of Volumes 9-12 that explain Ayase and Kanako's feelings, and the backstory between Kirino, Kyousuke, and Manami. Volumes 9 and 11 are almost basically skipped altogether. There is also plenty of side material on Baka Tsuki. Check out the PSP games too, even summaries if you can't watch playthroughs or get a copy."

Oreimo,1v6dr1,megustafap,2,Sun Jan 19 15:41:09 2014 UTC,I just finished the series too. The post-show depression is heavy. :(    EDIT: I hope somebody reads this because I don't want to make a separate post. Does anybody have any other anime that they watched to help get over the post-oreimo emptiness that I'm feeling?  Or life advice in general?
Oreimo,1v6dr1,Stompystomp,3,Fri Jan 17 23:00:05 2014 UTC,Try Chunnibyou.
Oreimo,1v6dr1,TY3000,2,Sat Jan 18 10:40:03 2014 UTC,"I feel ya brother.  I suggest you watch a funny romcom or something similar like Noucom. It is usually like this I get over this feeling but in rare cases like ""Elfen Lied"",  I had to endure it for weeks by watching Monster."
Oreimo,1v6dr1,Stompystomp,2,Sat Jan 18 08:27:09 2014 UTC,"I replaced my post-oreimo depressions with post-toradora depressions today. Great show, too, and to be honest I loved that show even more, but that's because it resonated with me more closely than Oreimo did."

Oreimo,1v0cah,Forkii,10,Sun Jan 12 04:29:10 2014 UTC,Well that's your personal opinion.  I actually liked the ending. It would be better if their last kiss was on the lips but sadly author was not allowed to write it like that. But I really like the whole idea of Kirino and Kyouske still being in a secret relationship.   Guess your ship sank and now you're mad.
Oreimo,1v0cah,DinTwo,6,Sun Jan 12 09:35:34 2014 UTC,"The last kiss was on the lips, the author did write it like that. At least it was according to an interview with the author in which he wishes the anime version had the kiss on the lips."

Oreimo,1v0cah,TrustMeIGotHaki,-5,Mon Jan 13 04:53:57 2014 UTC,"My ship did sink and I was mad at the time but not because of the ending, I just think it was a matter of bad writing (not saying I could do better lol) I would have been ok with the incest ending if they screwed or something but NO they just had a mock wedding and then ended the ""marriage"" like 10 seconds later. Not even a semi-H scene doe >.>"
Oreimo,1v0cah,Forkii,16,Sun Jan 12 10:01:20 2014 UTC,"Well Oreimo was never ment to be Hentai.   And if you did not know yet, the author was forced to separate Kirino and Kyouske by his bosses. He wanted to finish the story with them being officially together but apparently that would be ""wrong"" or something.   But as I said, that kiss at the end meant that they will continue being together secretly aka ""life consultations"""
Oreimo,1v0cah,GFrohman,12,Sun Jan 12 12:14:47 2014 UTC,"Atleast he had the balls to go for the incest ending. What would've really disappointed me would be if he went for the ""oops turns out we aren't really blood related!"" trick."
Oreimo,1v0cah,Forkii,4,Sun Jan 12 20:31:08 2014 UTC,"True that.   I get that people are mad because their ship sank but they should not say that it's ""one of the most disappointing conclusions to any story ever"", like seriously. The story was really good, the author even made all the fans happy with Kyouske dating Kuroneko and having that moment with Ayase.    He did everything like the fans wanted up until the ending. He ended it the way he thought the story should end (Anime's name is ""My Little Sister Can't be This Cute"" not ""My Kuroneko can't be this cute"" or ""My Ayase can't be this cute"").   Anyway, I think it's about time people stop bitching over the ending and just be happy that we got to watch this anime!  Now let's just hope his next one will as good if not better!"
Oreimo,1v0cah,konohasaiyajin,3,Sun Jan 12 22:37:28 2014 UTC,"not ""My Kuroneko can't be this cute""   That's because My Ruri CAN be this cute :)  It ended the way it was going to (did we ever really expect anything different?).  Also, If they would just have an english release of the PSP games we would all get what we want.  (thankfully Ziddy is working his was through translation, Ayase route was released for New Year 2014)."

Oreimo,1ufz5f,kiririno,3,Sun Jan 5 07:21:30 2014 UTC,omg...   thank you so much for showing me this :D  Does it end there or is their anything after that?
Oreimo,1ufz5f,Otaku_swag94,5,Sun Jan 5 23:35:06 2014 UTC,"That's fanmade, sorry"
Oreimo,1ufz5f,TY3000,3,Mon Jan 6 02:56:05 2014 UTC,O it's alright (i just died a little bit)
Oreimo,1ufz5f,9tehk1ll3r,2,Mon Jan 6 06:55:02 2014 UTC,Ah this was helpful for me too! Thank you for sharing!
Oreimo,1ufz5f,FlamingMicrowave,1 point,Sat Jan 18 07:51:16 2014 UTC,That was beautiful :)
Oreimo,1ufz5f,theitalianthunder,6,Thu Jan 9 04:12:44 2014 UTC,"One thing you could start with is to ""play"" the game. PSP Game is translated on youtube. There are also a few doujinshi that are non-h that I enjoyed."
Oreimo,1ufz5f,kiririno,4,Sun Jan 5 06:31:57 2014 UTC,I've read the manga. It was just as good if not better than the anime but it follows the same story so don't expect anything new. It was a nice experience though.
Oreimo,1ufz5f,jovvanni,1 point,Sun Jan 5 06:58:35 2014 UTC,"Thank you I was thinking about reading the manga, but was holding back because I thought it would be almost exactly like the manga.  I'll check into the mangas."
Oreimo,1ufz5f,-Niernen,1 point,Sun Jan 5 23:37:09 2014 UTC,I didn't enjoy them. I started reading them and then stopped when I realized the fanservice level was turned up to 11.
Oreimo,1ufz5f,-Niernen,4,Mon Jan 6 04:50:01 2014 UTC,The light novels are great. Same story but add a little bit more story for a couple characters. I hear the games are great too and well translated on YouTube
Oreimo,1ufz5f,--TheDoctor--,4,Sun Jan 5 07:31:03 2014 UTC,"Couple of chapters and entire volumes. Many parts of the last 4 voulmes are left out, Ayase and Kanako's arks, the backstories, and much more."
Oreimo,1ughr9,Aerakin,3,Sun Jan 5 13:13:56 2014 UTC,"Because it isn't relevant what happens to everyone after, it's not important to the timeline of where the story takes place. We ride the adventure of their present life and where we get off is where their future begins. We, as well as the characters in the show, do not know what lies ahead in their future, but for Kyousuke and Kirino, we feel like we can leave it to them to do what they need to do. No matter what struggles they face in the future, I don't need a conclusive, definitive ending. They are only beginning their lives and I trust that they will do just fine.  As usual, I would recommend reading this comment, as it really highlights a viewpoint that a lot of people miss when they are focused on best girls and ships. Characters like Ayase, Kuroneko, Kanako, Manami, etc. are more than just romantic harem plot points for Kyousuke and provide a lot of intrinsic subtleties that affect the way Kyousuke and Kirino behave in their words and actions."
Oreimo,1ughr9,Histy,2,Mon Jan 6 08:57:21 2014 UTC,"I guess you're right about the future of the other characters. However, it still feels like you don't even know their status at the end of the series (except Saori).   Again, I think most of my issues with the ending were really about the pacing of it. I do agree with the linked comment. The big problem is how fast everything happens. You can't really absorb and process the information fast enough, so you're left with a bad first impression of the ending. That's really difficult to get rid of, regardless of author intent.  Here, you can't even blame the animators, as the pace for the ending was the same in the LN.  Maybe you have information about other characters before the ending in the LN. I know a lot of stuff has been skipped in that regard. I might read the whole thing in one go, soon."
Oreimo,1ughr9,Histy,1 point,Mon Jan 6 13:13:01 2014 UTC,"Other than closure for the viewer, knowing what everyone else is doing doesn't really change what happens between Kyousuke and Kirino. Although it is implied that Manami no longer associates with the two, Ayase stops her pursuit of Kyousuke, Kanako continues her idol career and Kuroneko/Saori continue to do the usual meetups with Kyousuke/Kirino. These girls confessed to Kyousuke and ultimately were rejected, closing that chapter in their lives.   Pacing, I absolutely agree with you when it comes to Season 2 and is a common complaint amongst most viewers, because of content being omitted (like the glimpse of the camera person which is never brought up) and content being rushed (such as Kyousuke's interactions with Ayase over a period of time being squished into like 5 minutes of the beginning of an episode, to the confusion of many).   But that might be more due to a production directive issue, because of trying to finish the series to coincide with the light novel ending. Season 1 didn't have this issue because the novels were nowhere close to being finished. With how the novels were being released, there was no way a third season or a 2-cour could have finished in time. They were already cutting it close, which is why the OVAs came out later."
Oreimo,1ughr9,Reutertu3,3,Mon Jan 6 13:30:48 2014 UTC,"I actually liked that kind of ""open"" ending (I gotta admit though, that Oreimo is pretty much the only anime I've ever seen).  While I personally rooted for the SS Kirino, a straight forward incest ending would have raised a lot of questions. Not only is this questionable from a moral point of view, you also have to ask yourself what the distant future is going to bring (for example having kids is pretty much impossible).  So personally I liked that ending pretty much. It allows for a lot of scenarios. Maybe Kyosuke is getting along with one of the girls who confessed to him, maybe he and Kirino even become a couple again (which the Light Novel indicates as far as I know). It kinda allows me to pick an ending, that I'd like the most.  But yes, I very much see a problem with the overall length of the show. Especially the last 5 episodes just feel rushed and too many different plots were cramped into them. It could have easily been a series with 3 seasons."
Oreimo,1ughr9,SaranghaeyoNagi,2,Sun Jan 5 22:48:21 2014 UTC,"As someone who has also recently finished the entire series , I do agree that the ending was a bit of let down.   Further development of the characters , both main and minor , should have been introduced but we have the many characters like Kuroneko , Saori , Ayase and Manami being cut off at the ending.. What happened to them after Kyousuke rejecting them? Considering the dating-till-we-graduate-thing , we'd assume that the other girls will take the chance to get Kyousuke once more but we didn't see that happening on-screen and we're left to assume and guess. We would love to see the aftereffects of the rejection , them overcoming it and perhaps trying to win Kyou-chan's heart once more.  My main issue with the series finale is that it feels extremely rushed. We didn't even see much of the siblings dating during their lover phase and the other girls (besides Kuroneko and Saori). Why end it there , right ?  You can take your time to wrap the story up but just don't compress everything into a rather bad way to end my favourite series.   It's not a bad ending per se , but neither is it a good one."
Oreimo,1ughr9,laserman367,0,Sun Jan 5 14:57:49 2014 UTC,"I just finished the series, after rewatching the first season, just now too. I have to say this is one of the worst endings I have ever seen and can only think of School Days which left me with more dissapointment after the end.  Generally when a series ends, I feel bad until I start getting into the next one. But this isn't just that, it has a general sense of ""why"" about it. I would have been glad if they had simply ended it before the ova's (where it would be implied he goes after kuroneko), I'd have been glad if kyou simply hooked up with kuroneko in the ovas and thats it. I'd even have been fine with the semi unrealistical ending where they hide their relation from the world. But I find this ending was simply made to add a ""twist"" to the series so you would remember it, or it would stand it. The bad part is the only memory I recon you'll have of it is the dissapointment."
Oreimo,1ufpsk,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,5,Sun Jan 5 03:51:44 2014 UTC,I'm hoping for more too. Even if it's 1 in a million chance.
Oreimo,1ufpsk,NSXtypeR,1 point,Sun Jan 5 05:57:56 2014 UTC,If you have a PSP with cfw and the oreimo iso they have a patch for the kuroneko and kirino routes if you wanna actually play it. there's also the manga and light novels
Oreimo,1ufpsk,plays2,1 point,Sun Jan 5 17:24:09 2014 UTC,I completely forgot about the manga and light novels! I'll probably give those a read in the summer.
Oreimo,1ufpsk,sirbob6,2,Sun Jan 5 19:57:19 2014 UTC,"Just be prepared to be left hanging with the manga, it stopped after the 4th volume (which is about around the 5th episode of the 1st season)."
Oreimo,1udcpr,The_Kuroi_Kenshi,11,Sat Jan 4 05:03:32 2014 UTC,Sooooooooooooo.....  drama CD? What am I looking at here?  edit OH MY GOD MORE ANGEL AYASE-TAN  editII Praise be to the Based YouTube God who uploaded this
Oreimo,1udcpr,tanzorbarbarian,5,Sat Jan 4 08:41:26 2014 UTC,"That was quite awesome. Having the visuals rehashed from the anime really helps bring the auio track to life.  Judging by the tone of the CD, it sounds as if this happened after the events of OreImo, rather than wedging it in somewhere prior to the Ayase confession. Kirino and Kyousuke's relationship appears to be fairly stable and trusting. Ayase herself seems to be significantly more lenient than her pre-deredere self, and she does drop the phrase ""if you were to become my boyfriend"" multiple times.  IS THIS INDICATIVE OF AYASE TRUE END? :D"
Oreimo,1udcpr,azn6138,2,Sat Jan 4 16:50:59 2014 UTC,"I really can't figure out where this is placed either. I got the vibe that Ayase was done with Kyousuke after she got turned down, but I'm just not sure."
Oreimo,1udcpr,NSXtypeR,0,Sat Jan 4 17:25:12 2014 UTC,"This is before episode 12 of season 2 at the least. Because if this was after Ayase wouldn't act this way, and if it was after the entire series Kyousuke would have graduated and Kirino and Ayase would be in high school."
Oreimo,1udcpr,Chieftainy,3,Sat Jan 4 19:43:20 2014 UTC,"The ""scenes"" from the video are rehashes from the anime done by the uploader; the drama CD wouldn't have come with them.  Now, this may be sheer overanalysis, but here's my take.  There's no indication from the conversation as to whether Kyousuke is even in school anymore, since we only meet him at home. While we know that Ayase and Kirino are still in school together, they could be in high school.  It is valid to believe that Ayase wouldn't act this way, but as I mentioned, she seems to drop the ""if you were to become my boyfriend"" phrase a lot. The way she interweaves it, is almost as if she's ""been-there-(and-should-have-)done-that"" as a tease rather than the pre-confession berating, denial, and tsun response that she would have given. Even in general portrayal, she seems warmer than usual.  Considering that (I believe) she fell for him most thoroughly due to the stalker saga that wasn't animated, I don't think she'd have acted this way prior to him moving out from the house. Since she confesses to him right after he moves out from the apartment, I think it's really hard to place this event before that."
Oreimo,1udcpr,azn6138,0,Sun Jan 5 00:41:23 2014 UTC,There's no indication from the conversation as to whether Kyousuke is even in school anymore   Their school uniforms. Kirino and Ayase's would look like how Manami's was and Kyousuke wouldn't be wearing his old uniform.
Oreimo,1udcpr,Chieftainy,6,Sun Jan 5 00:49:09 2014 UTC,"Their school uniforms. Kirino and Ayase's would look like how Manami's was and Kyousuke wouldn't be wearing his old uniform.   Again, the images in the video are NOT part of the drama CD. They were put together by the uploader into a montage of sorts.  Every scene in the video has appeared somewhere in the anime."
Oreimo,1udcpr,azn6138,6,Sun Jan 5 01:43:41 2014 UTC,The loss of the Destroyer-Class HMS Angel Ayase-tan will never be forgotten.

Oreimo,1u9a2v,NSXtypeR,13,Thu Jan 2 21:07:12 2014 UTC,"As disheartening as it may be, I think the chances are near-zero.  There isn't much that hasn't been animated, as far as the books go. One of the few things is the Ayase stalker incident, which was entirely left out (and is the main reason as to why Ayase had a much better chance in the novels than she did in the anime)."
Oreimo,1u9a2v,arandomaltaccount,13,Thu Jan 2 21:35:36 2014 UTC,Wishing for alternate world OVAs similar to Clannad's Tomoyo and Kyou OVAs.  Would really enjoy a Kuroneko and an Ayase alternate world OVA.
Oreimo,1u9a2v,Chieftainy,4,Fri Jan 3 01:47:30 2014 UTC,I'm on board with this!
Oreimo,1u9a2v,bigdanrog,3,Fri Jan 3 06:36:03 2014 UTC,"The animators probably will need material for the alternate worlds which is decided upon by the light novel author. Until he adds anything to the Oreimo universe ( which is unlikely because the story has wrapped up ) , we might not get to see alternate worlds but I like the idea of an Ayase alternate world OVA !"
Oreimo,1u9a2v,SaranghaeyoNagi,3,Sat Jan 4 06:25:44 2014 UTC,"Maybe later, champ."

Oreimo,1u9a2v,MasterRiven,3,Mon Jan 6 23:19:08 2014 UTC,This saddens me :(
Oreimo,1u9a2v,-Niernen,10,Thu Jan 2 21:37:08 2014 UTC,"Very low. It is unlikely that they would go back to release stuff after the show is over. While they could go back and add the Ayase and Kanako arks, it is very unlikely. If they wanted to add them, they would have and would have made it 3 seasons (4 volumes per season like Haganai). Honestly, they rushed to get the anime over so it would finish with the light novel, and left a lot out of the last 4 volumes. If they had started the anime earlier, they could have paced it better and included a lot more."
