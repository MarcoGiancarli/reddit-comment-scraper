StudentNurse,3e58rc,ChaplnGrillSgt,2,Wed Jul 22 01:55:38 2015 UTC,I agree with your answers and rationales. Exactly what I was thinking.
StudentNurse,3e58rc,queencnos,2,Wed Jul 22 02:36:50 2015 UTC,"1- C. Although I was tempted to choose (A) due to ""tell me about..."" it plays into the patient's delusions. Therefore you must orient the patient.  2 - A. Once again, I was torn between A and C. But a patient with Myasthenia Gravis MUST have their medications on time.  3 - B. high BUN and High NA+ = dehydration. Therefore Fluid Volume Deficit.  :)   Edit: Formatting."
StudentNurse,3e58rc,PhysicsSaysNo,2,Wed Jul 22 04:35:17 2015 UTC,"Here are my answers with rationale:  1) C, bc I would not encourage delusions. In earlier stages it is best to correct the client gently than give in. In fact, I don't think we involve delusions unless we're sure the disease is very severe and will not get better.  2) This one I'm not really too sure on. I'm torn between C, as TB is a tough illness to beat and antivirals are important meds, and D, as levodopa often has to be taken in a timely manner. On an exam, I'd probably pick D.  3) This one was tough. I chose B, as all values are high (except bicarb), and the patient is delirious, both of which happen with fluid volume deficit. I can see it being A, though altered urinary elimination often won't spike it that high (in my experience; I could be wrong).  Thanks for this OP! I love practice questions."
StudentNurse,3e58rc,Yallah_Habibi,3,Wed Jul 22 02:04:14 2015 UTC,"New grad writing NCLEX in two days here..   1) A - important to inquire on thought pattern of client; remain from using demeaning comments such as ""you are being treated for a mental disorder"" (C). Although this question is poorly worded.  2) Answer is C, antibiotics must be given in a timely manner in order to prevent superinfections. Especially with TB, where they are taken for months.  3) Answer is B. Sodium is highly elevated, as well as BUN, which both indicate severe dehydration. Chloride and Potassium are both within normal ranges."
StudentNurse,3e58rc,Ellison22,2,Wed Jul 22 03:07:23 2015 UTC,Do you care to elaborate your rationale for question 2?   Why would the other diagnoses/medications NOT be the correct answers?
StudentNurse,3e58rc,InimitableMe,2,Wed Jul 22 03:27:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with 1 and 3. Not 100% on 2, but I seem to remember that patients with myasthenia gravis need their meds on time, or they may not be able to swallow them."
StudentNurse,3e58rc,InimitableMe,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:50:43 2015 UTC,"1) a) Tell me about ...  seems like the most therapeutic response.  I know that reorienting a person to reality is important, guiding them to reality therapeutically might be better to try first.  shrug   2) OH GOD i need to study meds so bad.   3) b) The patient is hypernatremic, so fluid volume is low, since if the patient had fluid to spare, it would follow the salt.  The chloride, potassium, and glucose levels are within normal limits, and I can't remember the proper serum bicarb and BUN levels.  But sodium is definitely high, so that's my answer; b.

StudentNurse,3e58rc,nguyencs,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:06:17 2015 UTC,"Regarding #2, it's not only about the meds. It's also about the diagnosis. Often times you can get questions correct without knowing the medication, if you understand the diagnosis properly.    Regarding #3, BUN is extremely high (normal BUN levels being 10- 25). What does a high BUN and high NA+ suggest about a patient's status? (Or, what does BUN evaluate?)   And.. just something to consider: although question #3 doesn't include a serum creatine value, what does it mean when both BUN and creatine are high, as opposed to only the BUN being high with a normal creatine?"

When you are applying for jobs, you'll find that many times the qualifications will mention that a ""BSN is preferred."" This doesn't mean it's necessarily required, (ADNs can definitely still get jobs) but nurses with a BSN might have a better chance at being called in for an interview and/or hired. However, experience is really the key factor. When interviewing as an ADN-RN, they typically like to hear that you have already started or anticipate continuing your education.   Yes, you can do more with a BSN - mostly you will have the option to work in nursing management."

Public university is usually cheaper, so you may want to go with CSUF. It's always going to be somewhat expensive for a second degree, though.   Have you thought about getting a traditional BSN as a second degree bachelor's student? UCI has a fairly decent nursing program.

I decided that it was not imperative to passing the NCLEX to sit down and drill pharm notes into my head.  Instead, I would study diagnoses and when meds for a diagnoses came up, I would review them along with the topic at hand.   It's much too overwhelming (and unnecessary, in my opinion) to try to learn a bunch of ""random"" medication facts.. And it's only going to be a small part of the test.

A? - the pt is COPD'er so turning up O2 is pointless due to chronic condition - so no on A  I pick B. b/c pt needs up their CO2. my rationale sucks.   EDIT - keep them coming.

StudentNurse,3e0qrg,pickledfeet,3,Wed Jul 22 01:41:17 2015 UTC,"I think the answer is B. Decrease the respiratory rate. Tidal volume has nothing to do with it, PaO2 level is acceptable so not A or C. If you decrease the respiratory rate it will allow more CO2 in and out as well as oxygen ultimately balancing the O2 and CO2 into the correct ranges and making consistent breathing easier."

StudentNurse,3e0qrg,captain_thrace,2,Wed Jul 22 01:40:15 2015 UTC,"I choose B because they are in respiratory alkalosis and need to retain some extra CO2. You can't increase FiO2 too much because the are a COPDer, Tidal volume shouldn't need changing because that is based on individual lung capacity. and leaving the vent at current settings wouldn't change the rate of respirations to allow the patient to compensate."
StudentNurse,3e1nmm,liblingfach,2,Tue Jul 21 07:10:58 2015 UTC,"I would advise that you   1) Talk to the head of your current nursing department about what they know about transferring from one nursing program to another. They might have the best solution/information about this situation.   2) If you don't already - start getting some colleges in mind that you could potentially transfer to.  Call their nursing dept., ask to  speak to their head of the dept. and explain your current situation, the unfortunate circumstances that has resulted in the need for transfer.   I'm not entirely sure, but, because your boyfriend is not a legal spouse - it could raise some conflict with the transfer. Meaning, if he were a legal spouse, the likelihood for transfer being successful would be probably be greater.   My condolences to you and your boyfriend.   Edit: Grammar."

StudentNurse,3e1nmm,notme1414,2,Wed Jul 22 04:08:44 2015 UTC,You need to ask the schools this question. It is usually difficult to transfer. It's much harder in Canada to transfer.
StudentNurse,3e1nmm,HistoricalRomance,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:13:29 2015 UTC,That's what I figured
StudentNurse,3e1nmm,olov244,2,Wed Jul 22 04:08:26 2015 UTC,"I did transfer nursing schools in Canada. It was tricky, though. Call the school you want to apply for and ask for their requirements.   There are different laws/regulations/standards of practice/Etc. between the provinces. I was unable to transfer to another province for this reason and ended up transferring to another school in the same province instead. Definitely consider this and explore all your options before you're disappointed. You may have to simply apply to your school of choice and retake your first year, accepting transfer credits for electives. This guarantees you get in, plus you will ideally have a kickass GPA first year because it's all review for you.   You may have to retake a course or two. For example, my school spread the biology over two years, and you needed first and second year credit for it to transfer as the equivalent of the other schools courses. I couldn't take bio 1 at school A and bio 2 at school B. Prepare yourself to take an extra course online or to study during the summer. You may also find different elective requirements. For example, I had taken English Literature at school A, and school B required English Composition. I had to take an extra English class to meet the graduation requirements.  The next thing you depend on is an open seat in the nursing program at the school you want to apply for. A transfer student, in my experience, has lower priority than a re-entry student originally from that same school. They may have 10 seats open, but what if they have 10 students returning to the program?  Overall, admission requirements may vary. If your old school accepted a minimum 60% average, you may run into problems when the new school has a minimum 75% average. Ensure your academic performance is strong enough to survive a transfer.   You will need to ensure you have a copy of your records from your current university. I also recommend you get a letter from the program head stating that you are a student in good standing.   Steps to take:  Gather your documents before you make your calls. This will save a lot of time.   Call the adviser at the school you want to attend. Explain your background, ask what transfer credit will be granted for your completed courses, and ask to be put in contact with the nursing school.   Once the nursing school contacts you, ensure they have a seat available for you. Ensure there is good curriculum overlap between your current and desired school. You don't want to miss a huge portion of your learning because your old school hasn't covered something yet and your new one already did it.   Be patient. This takes a long time. Start to finish, trying to transfer took me a few months. It was expensive, too, because I had to pay for applications, records, couriered mail, new required texts, and so on.   It is not impossible to transfer schools if you are willing to retake things or add another (albeit much lighter) year. You may not be able to transfer seamlessly between provinces, so don't be too disappointed if you can't.   I wish you luck. It's not a simple process, but it can be done."

StudentNurse,3dzdxr,Syrup_Chugger_3000,13,Mon Jul 20 19:39:32 2015 UTC,"Pick a review course with excellent reviews (I took Hurst, but Kaplan is also highly-rated) and do the whole thing from start to finish.  For me, review of 4 years of content was very helpful, but the THOUSANDS of practice questions is what ensured that I passed the NCLEX.  I studied for 2-4 hours per day Monday through Friday for 3 weeks before the exam.  After all the Hurst Q-reviews I did (and the Kaplan Q-banks that people love), I really started to understand exactly what the NCLEX people were looking for when asking a question.    Some extremely important tips for me:  -1. Airway 2. Breathing 3. Circulation 4. Safety  -delegation: know what an LPN/LVN and UAP can and can't do  -generic names for drugs (there are no trade names on the new NCLEX...for example you'll see ""furosemide"" and you need to know that it is Lasix to be able to answer the question).  -SATA are a huge, massive portion.  Tackle SATA's like True and False (for example: Is option A a true or false statement regarding the question?  Is option B true or false of the question?  Is option C true or false of the question, etc).  -Every word that is placed in the question is there for a reason.  Read each question...then read it again.  Then read your options.  Then read the question again.  Before you hit ""next,"" read the question one more time.  Sometimes it takes a few times for the ""aha"" moment to happen.  I absolutely loved the Hurst review.  Their first-time pass rate is crazy high (something like 96% of people who take Hurst pass the NCLEX).  I felt like I had a better grip on nursing after taking this review.  I took the NCLEX last week and passed in 75 questions.  It was horrifying but the fact that I prepared so thoroughly played a huge part in how confident I was, and my confidence is why I passed.  Just put in your time and do everything you're supposed to do, and you'll most likely pass.  Good luck!"

Don't second guess yourself- your first instinct is usually right! Focus on each question individually.  I took Hurst as well and passed in 75, but in addition to Hurst I did questions from Saunders and Uworld( would recommend it/ they have 1 week free trials).

But RENT the books you do need. So many people buy and never use them again or they are outdated before they do! Chegg and Amazon have been lifesavers for me--I'm talking 250-500 total per semester!
StudentNurse,3e01x7,Kriserenity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:47:58 2015 UTC,"This is typically very good advice, however, check with current students and faculty and find out if some texts are used for multiple levels. This is the case for Ackley (Nursing Diagnosis) and Hinkle & Cheever (Med-Surg) for my program.  Some of my classmates looked into the cost of renting for the three semester that we will need it and it would have cost more to rent in these cases.   That being said, for Med-Surg many of my classmates got the two-volume version which is easier to bring to a study location (you typically only need Ackley or another reference for lecture)."

StudentNurse,3e01x7,tacolocooocrazy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:54:45 2015 UTC,dont buy them until the semester starts.   Talk with older students to see if you need the book and ask the library if they will have it on file.   If you still feel like you need it ask older students if theyre selling their books.   I honestly didn't use half my books 1st semester...and yes I'm mad lol
StudentNurse,3e01x7,BubblyBullinidae,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:51:16 2015 UTC,That is frustrating. I used $300 of my Pell grant to buy my A&P book. All I've used is the online code and the lab manual. I would've just gotten the manual and code if I had known. I can't even sell it back because they were loose leaf and can't be sold once the plastic wrap is off!
StudentNurse,3e01x7,BubblyBullinidae,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:27:01 2015 UTC,"Well my lab instructor said the dug book isn't necessary, just Google, and I never bought the Math text.   I think it all depends on your instructors. If they post good notes then you might not need it. I've been getting away with only buying one book so far (Semester 3 part time) and I managed to find a 70$ book, used online for 22$.   I would suggest not buying until the course starts, speak to your instructor to see if previous editions are ok (they are cheaper). I highly suggest that you DON'T buy from the schools bookstore as I have always found their prices are way more expensive. Try E-bay, Amazon and others to look for cheaper books. You can always rent them too (although I prefer to keep mine just in case I need it in the future)  If you are fine with the nefarious, you can always look for your books on a torrent site.   The only issue you might have, are books that require online codes. I had a class where the previous edition was fine, but it didn't come with the code. I had to pay 60$ to get online access just to do one paper, that sucked.   Here is a website that has some other places for you to get cheap books.   http://lifehacker.com/5618881/five-best-places-to-buy-cheap-textbooks"

StudentNurse,3e01x7,naeve,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:40:05 2015 UTC,"They're very strict about who they do and do not keep in the nursing program. I just graduated high school this May. For nursing students fresh out of high school there are 2 options: 2 year program and 3 year program. The 2 year program is where your pre reqs are mixed in with your nursing course. The 3 year program is where you take your pre reqs during your first year, then nursing courses the final 2. Well I selected the 2 year because I already have Comp 1/2, college algebra, A&P 1/2, and Chemistry finished. There would be no point in me doing the 3 year program. Well, I have heard nothing but negativity: ""you're going to take the easy way out,"" ""make sure this is what you really want,"" ""good luck, no one has done it since 1997,"" ""it'll be difficult"" blah blah blah. It's very disheartening as I've wanted to be a nurse since I was 10"
StudentNurse,3e01x7,azbartender,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:55:16 2015 UTC,I bought editions that were one behind for anywhere from $1-10 used on Amazon. The information is exactly the same.

StudentNurse,3dtgdn,Kcgeeee,26,Sun Jul 19 07:57:04 2015 UTC,"I failed my first semester of clinical. It was really disheartening, I had a B+ in the lecture portion but my instructor told me ""Some people are meant to be nurses, and you are not one of them."" She had no specifics on why I would not make a good nurse, or why I deserved to fail, just that she had a gut feeling that I was not meant to be a nurse and gave me a big fat F in clinical, which made me fail the entire semester and gave me a 9 credit F on my transcript. I went to the dean crying and she handed me a tissue and told me to go home. I asked if I could get back into the program next year and was told my GPA was now too low.  I sincerely thought about giving up and going into a different major. Then, with some encouragement from friends I got a job as a nurses aide, took some extra courses to boost my GPA a little bit (only got it as high as 2.67) and began applying to other programs. I actually got into a school that had more than 400 applicants and accepted 60. I gave a good interview and explained my situation and how I was working on bettering myself--I also scored very high on the critical thinking entrance exam. I started the new school about 1 year after failing out of the other program. The new program was amazing and I am glad I switched. The instructors were so supportive and never made me feel like I didn't belong there. I graduated and got a job right away. I am now working my dream job in L&D!   When I graduated and passed NCLEX, I sent an email to the instructor that failed me, to tell her I ended up succeeding. She did not reply. haha"
StudentNurse,3dtgdn,wicksa,15,Sun Jul 19 15:44:13 2015 UTC,"That subjective bullshit bothers me SO much. I had a clinical instructor that said the same thing to me because during skills lab I messed up something - on the first try doing it with a mannequin after only seeing the skill performed once while standing in a crowd of 12 people around the mannequin.  She proceeded to fail me in every clinical situation I had with her, luckily I only had her for a few and my overall clinical GPA was high enough that I passed anyway. I ended up actually graduating second in my class and couldn't help but make a face at her when I walked across the stage after giving a speech at our graduation,  haha."
StudentNurse,3dtgdn,Divisadero,3,Sun Jul 19 16:22:56 2015 UTC,Sounds like an awful program if your instructor used her gut feeling as the reason for failing you and your dean didn't seem bothered by that. I think it's good you didn't continue there
StudentNurse,3dtgdn,firstsnowfall,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:36:34 2015 UTC,I agree. 2 years later she was no longer working there. I can only hope they asked her to leave because she was so awful.

Take the time off to evaluate why you failed - did you have too many other commitments, did you not study enough, or did you study ineffectively?   The students who I saw continue to fail were the ones who blamed the school, the program, the instructors, the textbook, etc. Try to think of ways to improve your performance. The upside is you are already familiar with the material, so now you just need to refine it. Good Luck!"
StudentNurse,3dtgdn,StefaniePags,2,Sun Jul 19 09:44:20 2015 UTC,"I came close. I caught the flu over a weekend and couldn't study for an upcoming OB test. There were only 4 tests in that subject and I failed the first miserably. I wasn't 100% the rest of the week and did poorly on the second. I sacrificed peds studying to make sure I knocked the next two tests out of the park and squeaked by.  My buddy, another guy in the class, wasn't so lucky. He ended up having to take a comprehensive as a last ditch effort to stay in the program and scored a 79.x%. He graduated the following year after waiting to get back in the program.  My advice to you is the same as it was to him. Don't sit around. Keep studying as if you were still in. In 6 months when you start back up you'll be more than ready."

My advice would be not to drop studying - keep up with material, keep building up your study guides/etc. for the NCLEX, but also try to get some practical experience in. Get a job as a PCA or CNA or whatever. I'm so sad I can't do that as I go through school, because everything seems easier for my classmates who've had exposure to those positions.

StudentNurse,3dtfmm,Wanderlust0627,2,Sun Jul 19 07:43:33 2015 UTC,"I am in nursing school at Saint Louis University, originally from Tacoma Washington. Something to consider if you are going for a four year bachelors program is to pick schools that are ""direct admit"". If you don't know what that is, it means that you apply for both the university and the nursing program together. You're accepted into the nursing program coming in as a freshman. Most other schools have you two years of ""pre-req"" classes and then apply for the nursing program going into your junior year. I wanted to avoid this because at many schools, it's very competitive and I wasn't confident I would be able to get straight A's and I didn't want to have to transfer if I wasn't accepted into the nursing program. Also, you have more nursing classes early on which is awesome!!  As a person who went out of state for college, I can tell you that it is very exciting and gives you the chance to ""be a new you"" as the clique goes. I love being in a new place with different kinds of people than the ones I grew up with. But it does suck not being able to go home as easily and when I am home, all my college friends are far away.   Most Jesuit universities are direct admit nursing. Whether or not you are religious, it is way beyond worth it for the nursing program and the Jesuit part doesn't really have that big of an impact.  I would definitely recommend going to a direct admit school. SLU is awesome by the way too! The nursing teachers are amazing and the sim lab is super advanced.   Best of luck deciding on what school to go to, let me know if you have any questions! :)"

I opted to go to a private university right out of high school, where as long as I kept my GPA up, I was in the nursing program (actual nursing classes started your junior year). Other schools you do your two years of pre-reqs then have to apply. It's very competitive. Which is why I opted to spend more money to be able to get through school faster."

I knew I was going to Missouri because I have family here and I knew I wanted to be in an accelerated program so I could get back home asap plus I already had my bachelor's in a different major. I'd recommend pulling up the nursing state board websites for the states you're interesting, look for programs in what degree you want (bachelor's, associates, whatever), look at those schools to see if you match their pre-reqs, and look up their nclex pass rates. That's what I did and managed to narrow it down to just a couple schools in Missouri :)"
StudentNurse,3dtfmm,Amymars,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:15:15 2015 UTC,"Start at writing down a list of what is your must-haves? Affordable living? Employable? Near a decent size city? Risk of getting snow? I'd start by making a list of what you want living there since you will be there for the next two years. Can you survive living in corn fields and potentially no jobs in the healthcare field or do you want to live in a larger city? Are you willing to commute potentially 40 minutes from the nearest town to go to nursing school?   If you don't want to risk heavy snow, you could cut out a good chunk of the states right there. If you want to live in on the east coast, you could cut it further. If you want a mixture of balance between finding a small size city and affordable living, midwest may be the way to go."
StudentNurse,3dtfmm,tacolocooocrazy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:47:47 2015 UTC,I wanted to go to school out of state. It turned out to be a pain in the butt and I'm at my state school now.   You need to be sure your courses from your pre reqs will be accepted by the new school. Also be sure they dont require MORE courses than the schools near you. If they do then you will be looking at taking an extra course for that program...and what if you don't get in? money wasted.   Also look into tuition assistance for out of state student. MD has a grant to give out of state nurses in state tuition. SUPER helpful and will save you thousands.   But keep in my nursing schools everywhere are competitive. Sooo many people are trying to get into the programs and there aren't enough spaces for everyone. If your grades aren't great (not saying they aren't) then maybe volunteer and work to boost your odds. Maybe do the 2 year degree 1st then go back for the 4 year. 2 years are sometimes easier to get into than 4 year.

StudentNurse,3dpiyl,reallynotthatblonde,2,Sat Jul 18 15:52:42 2015 UTC,"I would get a BSN first. Every NP/APN I speak to tells me that I should get a few years of nursing experience under my belt before I even go for a masters. Many programs also require you to not only have a BSN but also a length of time working in a certain floor (ie CRNAs usually need ~2 years in ICU). After a BSN you are still very much a rookie nurse and don't really know how to operate completely safely. I think going straight into the MSN without any real clinical experience would make for a very dangerous NP. Your real teaching happens working with patients, not in a classroom. If you're getting a CS degree, have you ever looked into informatics? It's a growing field in nursing. If you wanted to get a masters in a managerial/informatics role instead of a more hands on patient contact role, perhaps you could forgo the BSN."
StudentNurse,3dpiyl,charlottethespider,5,Sat Jul 18 17:02:05 2015 UTC,I do believe that MSN programs have a prerequisite of at least a  bachelor's in nursing. I've never heard of a masters in nursing program accepting students from non nursing degrees.

StudentNurse,3dpiyl,DanKC,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:26:02 2015 UTC,What kind of MSN do you want to get?
StudentNurse,3dndb3,womanwithoutborders,5,Fri Jul 17 17:58:13 2015 UTC,"I am an ADN-RN and had a job lined up in a local Magnet hospital's ICU a month before I graduated. I did have to sign a contract to obtain my BSN within a certain (reasonable) amount of time after graduation. They cover the cost of that with another work commitment. I feel pretty lucky to live and work where I do.  That being said, I never would have gone the ADN route if I hadn't worked at this same hospital as a CNA and confirmed, firsthand, that the hospital does frequently hire from the program I wound up attending.   Like u/theonepower said, highly dependent on the local market. The tl;dr of it is do your research on your local market, and you WILL have to get your bachelor's eventually. But why not let your employer cover the costs if you can ;) ?"
StudentNurse,3dndb3,mountainathlete,3,Fri Jul 17 18:27:37 2015 UTC,"The plan is to get the BSN immediately, so I'm hoping I could get my employer to pay for that!"
StudentNurse,3dndb3,willamsweave,3,Fri Jul 17 18:32:43 2015 UTC,Just be careful with your planning. Some  RN to BSN programs require a year's worth of RN experience for the RN to BSN program.
StudentNurse,3dndb3,willamsweave,2,Fri Jul 17 18:51:10 2015 UTC,"Wow, really? Thanks for the heads up, I'll be sure to do some research on that."
StudentNurse,3dndb3,Purplish86,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:59:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the top few in my state require a year's worth. Some other programs don't though. Whatever works for you and your schedule after graduation, I guess. :)"
StudentNurse,3dndb3,hanbanthirteen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:16:43 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware of that, being in a traditional BSN program that awards you your RN right along with your BSN."
StudentNurse,3dndb3,mountainathlete,3,Sun Jul 19 15:56:55 2015 UTC,But how do you find an employer that will pay for your BSN?
StudentNurse,3dndb3,hanbanthirteen,3,Fri Jul 17 19:06:43 2015 UTC,"In my case anyway, they advertised in in their job listings. Something like ""Associate's Degree RNs hired into this position will commit to getting their BSN w/in (X) years of hiring. (employer) will help with the financial cost."""
StudentNurse,3dndb3,stupidsmartphone,2,Fri Jul 17 19:38:41 2015 UTC,Hm. Thank you!
StudentNurse,3dndb3,mountainathlete,2,Fri Jul 17 20:12:11 2015 UTC,How soon should I start applying for a position if im in my final semester of an ADN Program?
StudentNurse,3dndb3,stupidsmartphone,5,Fri Jul 17 23:06:39 2015 UTC,Now
StudentNurse,3dndb3,FartingWhooper,2,Sat Jul 18 00:44:07 2015 UTC,"Also I want to clarify, Im going into my final semester I start in the last week of August. Would employers be receptive to my application still or shluld I wait until I'm in my preceptorship?"
StudentNurse,3dndb3,stupidsmartphone,3,Sat Jul 18 00:54:57 2015 UTC,Apply anyways. Worst that could happen is they say no. Best that could happen is you have a secured job when you graduate.

StudentNurse,3dndb3,spasticpez,4,Sat Jul 18 00:44:50 2015 UTC,Job prospects are going to differ greatly based on the market you are in. I know in my area (Northwest Florida) almost every graduate of my ADN program that I have asked has found employment at a hospital immediately afterwards. One of them was about 2 years ago and is currently a charge nurse on the night shift.    Moral of the story: depends on your area.    I will also be pursuing a BSN right after graduation by slowly taking classes.
StudentNurse,3dndb3,theonepower,3,Fri Jul 17 18:07:05 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, two years to become a charge nurse? That's crazy...and encouraging."
StudentNurse,3dndb3,shayshay33,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:49:54 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately at the hospital I currently work at (as a medical scribe) the charge nurse gets a lot of added responsibility but no increase in pay or any other sort of benefit. As a result, none of the ER nurses want to volunteer for the charge nurse position."
StudentNurse,3dndb3,dyskras,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:41:31 2015 UTC,"As someone from North Florida, that's good news! May I ask what you're doing for that BSN? Online school?"
StudentNurse,3dndb3,crackinspector,2,Fri Jul 17 18:31:00 2015 UTC,"I plan on taking classes online/in person. There's a university campus here in town, luckily!"
StudentNurse,3dndb3,panpanpanda,4,Fri Jul 17 19:33:48 2015 UTC,"I am an ADN-RN. I graduated in May from a community college and enrolled right away into a top ranked RN-BSN program. I'll finish the BSN in approximately one year (two classes at a time, going all semesters straight through.) I work full time for a large teaching hospital, they paid for my tuition. I want to stay with them for the benefits, but they require a BSN. I also really, really want to be inpatient. I had several really wonderful doctors/nurses shoot my resume to all the right people and all of them told me there is no way around the BSN requirement. They cant even hire me if Im matriculated in a program. I was basically told, come back next year and we will get you wherever you want.  I also live in a saturated market with 90% of hospitals requiring a BSN before they even look at you. So if I were to leave my hospital, I wouldn't get much else...unless I wanted to do psych in a sketchy-you-might-get-shot part of the city.  Luckily, they just bought a smaller, community hospital that does not require BSNs. By the grace of god, a spot opened up, I interviewed, and was offered the job. Its actually considered a transfer for me since its within my health system, so I keep all my tuition and health benefits. I start in August. Its definitely not where I want to be long-term, but it is the best and only option if I want to work as an RN this first year.  My fellow classmates were either hired by the doctor's offices they work for, are still looking, or moved out of state. My one friend got offered a spot on a cardiac ICU floor in Milwaukee. They pretty much offered her the job during the interview."
StudentNurse,3dndb3,Generoh,3,Sat Jul 18 14:11:01 2015 UTC,"Most of my classmates found jobs pretty fast... in fact quite a few had them lined up a month or so before we even finished. I'm currently set to start working on my BSN in the fall and a lot of my classmates are too, but only one facility in the area is putting pressure on their nurses to have their BSN, and they still have a 3 year window to get it."
StudentNurse,3dndb3,crackinspector,2,Fri Jul 17 19:04:32 2015 UTC,"I graduated with my ADN last year. I was working at my current hospital (level 1 trauma/university affiliated) as a pharmacy tech before (and during) school, so they paid for the ADN. I was hired into neuro ICU, worked there for about 6 months and hated it, so I switched to PACU, which is a much better fit for me. I had to sign a 2-yr contract to get into ICU, which is ok because I've been at this hospital for almost 10 years anyway... Not really going anywhere. I just applied to start bridge coursework for the MSN in nursing education in January- I have a BA in math, so I'm going to forego getting a BSN and get right into a more academic track. There's a huge nursing research and education department at this hospital, so I'm hoping to end up there eventually."
StudentNurse,3dndb3,deardear,2,Sat Jul 18 00:52:58 2015 UTC,Sign a contract to work in ICU? Is this common? I've never heard of that before.
StudentNurse,3dndb3,Cissyrene,2,Sat Jul 18 03:57:10 2015 UTC,Maybe like a residency program
StudentNurse,3dndb3,snakejuice33,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:44:09 2015 UTC,most of the hospitals in this area that have formal new grad residency programs (like the one I was in) make you sign a contract to work there for 2 years.
StudentNurse,3dndb3,erb047,2,Sun Jul 19 00:38:42 2015 UTC,Got a job in home care right after graduation and started my  BSN online at the same time. Once I got my BSN I applied and was hired into a magnet hospital.
StudentNurse,3dndb3,wicksa,2,Sat Jul 18 08:23:11 2015 UTC,"I just graduated in March. I took my NCLEX in April and the next day got hired to a Level 2 Trauma ED RN residency. It's been great! I'm in the pacific northwest, though, and it looks like you're in Florida so my experience will be nothing to do with yours. Just thought I'd share!"
StudentNurse,3do05f,Darksoulist,2,Fri Jul 17 20:48:58 2015 UTC,"Priority! Priority! Priority! Focus on priority questions. The majority of mine contained those questions. Other than:  - Just accept that you're not going to know enjoying - If you are still taking the test, you haven't failed yet (even if it takes you 200 questions) - Don't beat yourself up if you know you got a question wrong (sometimes you'll realize the right answer shortly after submitting it) - Take your time, breath deep, and stay strong!   Good luck! It took me two times (all 265 questions both times) but you'll do it!"
StudentNurse,3do05f,Dezzybear1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:18:28 2015 UTC,"I think the hardest part is that I don't know everything. It kind of psychs me out that ""what if I see the stuff I don't know."" I have about 3 weeks before my test, so hopefully I can work towards getting over that. Thank you :)"
StudentNurse,3do05f,Dezzybear1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:14:55 2015 UTC,You're going to see a lot of stuff you don't know. Might as well accept that now and learn how to give yourself the best possible chance. Doing tons of practice questions will help with that.
StudentNurse,3do05f,jron91,2,Sat Jul 18 07:12:19 2015 UTC,I graduated December of 2013 and didn't pass it til 2 weeks ago. Granted I took it once it January failed in 117. Then took it again and passed in 150. The nclex mastery app is really helpful. Kaplan questions. Might want to refresh on content cuz it's been so long. I sucked at SATA as well. Had like 19 of them on the nclex. Even if you don't get any of them right you can still pass.
StudentNurse,3dnaiv,theonepower,2,Fri Jul 17 17:37:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the shout!
StudentNurse,3dglp4,awayshallfade,39,Thu Jul 16 02:48:07 2015 UTC,Google search RN average salary in your state.  That always helped me.
StudentNurse,3dglp4,Dozed,9,Thu Jul 16 04:12:47 2015 UTC,I giggled and mentally nodded because I didn't realize how often I did that to make myself feel better bout going to nursing school
StudentNurse,3dglp4,Notinmyhous,3,Thu Jul 16 06:02:49 2015 UTC,"Haha, glad you could relate. I'd feel like OP, google the salary stuff, and think ""oh, yeah"", and then I'd start studying again. Haha"

StudentNurse,3dglp4,PickleGypsy,2,Fri Jul 17 00:59:20 2015 UTC,"Not bad, but not good either. No one goes into it for the money. There's been a pay freeze for 5 years now and the government have announced that over the next 5 years nurses will only get a 1% pay rise."
StudentNurse,3dglp4,_tarasbulba,2,Fri Jul 17 04:56:58 2015 UTC,"and parliament just got a 10% pay raise, no?"
StudentNurse,3dglp4,charlottethespider,2,Sun Jul 19 10:12:23 2015 UTC,Technically it was imposed on them as MPs no longer decide their own pay. And technically it's zero cost as the 10% increase is counterbalanced by reductions in MPs benefits packages and changes to their pensions. Nurses (and other public sector workers) however have had their pensions meddled with and also get a real terms pay cut.
StudentNurse,3dglp4,_tarasbulba,10,Sun Jul 19 14:12:17 2015 UTC,"I did but got over it quick since I had a test the next week.   Hint hint, keep the train moving."

StudentNurse,3dglp4,destroyingtocreate,6,Thu Jul 16 03:48:41 2015 UTC,"I feel like this pretty often too. I always thought I was a pretty good student, but nursing school makes me feel like a Grade A moron sometimes. For me, clinicals really help me to remember (part of) why I am pursuing this field. Even if the classes suck or the patient/care plan/faculty is difficult, knowing that I helped someone and impacted their life positively keeps me going.       I am the type of person who likes to research ideas too, if that makes any sense. I look up salaries, housing costs, specialties, and all sorts of different locations or events I could actually afford to travel to. Seeing all of the options and doors I'm opening for myself helps. Being able to be financially independent and do things with my life motivates me a lot.      I think the key thing for me to keep from getting overwhelmed was finding those little lights to keep the end of my tunnel lit. Also, I like to take things a week at a time. A day seems too short for me, so I try to look at each week and get a general idea of what I need to do. Now, do I actually do all of these things or study near as much as I need to? Absolutely not, but I'm not one of those hyper-organized people.      All this rambling to say: stop and take a deep breath when you need to. Try not to get overwhelmed (easier said than done, I know), and just do the best you can. That's all you can do really. Find the little things that keep you going, whether it has to do with the program or just ways to de-stress on occasion.     You're half way through, you've got this!! Good luck!"
StudentNurse,3dglp4,nightcreature,4,Thu Jul 16 05:54:03 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind about your ""average grades"" that you're surrounded by above average people. At least in my school getting admitted was hell. One of the hardest programs to get an admission. The average GPA was a 3.7-3.8 and most of us were taking the same A&P, micro and pharm that pharmacy, medical and dental students were taking. Whenever I busted my ass in school and barely did better than the average person I had to remind myself that the average person in nursing school is also busting their ass."
StudentNurse,3dglp4,Notinmyhous,3,Thu Jul 16 06:07:51 2015 UTC,"Excellent point. My school was the same...I don't think anyone got into the program with less than a 3.7 GPA. I'll have to keep this in mind also, so thanks for the reminder!"

The test questions most teachers use come from a test bank and they are found word for word on there. I still study, but i go over everything I can find on my current subject, and it has helped me go from an average student to acing everything. And I am still getting level 3s on my ATI, so I am not hurting myself in the long run, or any other nonsense people may come up with for not using this resource. Work smarter, not harder.   I definitely feel your pain, but don't give up. Just keep swimmin'! Take it day by day."

StudentNurse,3derds,Stineyd,5,Wed Jul 15 18:24:31 2015 UTC,Because I don't want to be a doctor. Honest and to the point.
StudentNurse,3derds,Nighthawke78,9,Thu Jul 16 02:01:30 2015 UTC,"I respond by explaining the difference in the modalities - doctors treat the disease, nurses treat the person."
StudentNurse,3derds,intelligent_life,2,Wed Jul 15 22:51:19 2015 UTC,I really like that. Thanks!
StudentNurse,3derds,ajh1717,7,Thu Jul 16 00:03:57 2015 UTC,"Not devoting at least an additional 8 years of just school/residency to your life before you can start working and making actual money (depending on specialty, this time may be longer).  Less debt once you are done with school.  Completely different roles within healthcare.  Lots of legal bullshit (even more than nurses have) that is a clusterfuck to deal with, especially with all these new laws."
StudentNurse,3derds,Captain_Angua,4,Wed Jul 15 21:06:47 2015 UTC,"I start with-my dad is a doctor. He is very hands on with his patients. Takes the time to change diapers, sooth crying, etc.(NICU). He's an exception to the rule. Most docs don't do that sort of thing according to every Nurse I've ever talked to (or been left with in the call room while he talks to family or deals with an emergency).   I choose nursing because I want to provide that sort of hands on care. Without giving up time with my family."
StudentNurse,3derds,Captain_Angua,3,Wed Jul 15 19:19:54 2015 UTC,It should be noted that my dad spent so much time at the hospital when I was a child i thought he lived there.   He regrets missing as much of my childhood as he did.
StudentNurse,3derds,-ap,2,Wed Jul 15 19:22:50 2015 UTC,Sounds like a great doctor
StudentNurse,3derds,Captain_Angua,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:50:11 2015 UTC,"He is. I'm also his kid, so probably a little biased. But he was also gone, a lot. He feels guilty about that, even though my siblings and I get it."
StudentNurse,3derds,destroyingtocreate,3,Fri Jul 17 12:08:24 2015 UTC,"Ugh. Hate this question.. and hate the people who ask it, as if nursing is some kind of lowly job/career..   First (this one might not be popular) nurses are often more well rounded than docs because they get all different types of patients, we see it all, we treat it all (though, I suppose that depends on the unit/area you're in).  Whereas, doctors specialize (cardiology, GI, neuro.. whatever) and when they focus all their attention to that one area, they lose their broad based/general knowledge that nurses are constantly building on.   Second, nurses get to do a lot of hands on stuff plus we make critical decisions.  The doctors do procedures and diagnose, but it's just not the same - they have significantly less time at the bedside, which is where I want to be.   Third, the doctor isn't our boss. Many people believe this to be true, but it is false. Nurses have the ability to critically think and question doctors orders or make suggestions about a patient's treatment.  Fourth I tell them to go to nursing school and see how fucking easy it is.. Or how ""lazy"" nurses are..   TL;DR We are (usually) just as smart - we just chose a different position on the playing field.. Different people have different reasons as to why. But I absolutely will not accept being told nurses are lazy or that nursing is easy."
StudentNurse,3derds,drummerboy76,2,Thu Jul 16 00:27:58 2015 UTC,I always respond that I have the brains to be a doctor but the heart to be a nurse. Becoming a nurse is just as difficult because we have to double check everything that the doctor orders and act as a patient advocate.
StudentNurse,3derds,DanKC,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:02:30 2015 UTC,"You also have way more options in nursing, between all the clinical specialties to administrative and policy roles. Besides nurses that decide they want to diagnose and prescribe can become NPs. I also explain the difference between the nursing model and the medical model."
StudentNurse,3derds,womanwithoutborders,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:32:28 2015 UTC,"Mostly when I get that question I explain that there is a difference between the medical model of healthcare and the nursing model. If I wanted to identify and treat, I'd be a doctor. However, because I care about the patient as a whole, I am pursuing nursing."
StudentNurse,3derds,562dreezy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:21:53 2015 UTC,"its not cost effective to be a doctor anymore. with healthcare reforms and insurance companies paying less and less for procedures, its illogical to go to school for 7+ years, come out with tons of debt, and get paid less than some advanced practice nurses."

I'm currently trying to get my pre-reqs done but the more I look back the more I realize waiting has been the best thing for me. I now have the option to go part time at work, which I didn't have before. So now I can focus on my education. It takes time but we'll all get there."
StudentNurse,3dfk14,BenzieBox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:30:36 2015 UTC,"I started out as pre-nursing when I was 18, messed around and partied, got low grades in my pre-reqs (in anatomy), got rejected from every nursing school I applied to, changed majors, got my bachelors in health science, decided to quit trying to get into nursing school, my nursing pre-reqs expired, retook my prereqs, barely passed anatomy again, applied to an out of state accelerated program, got in, and have a semester and a half till I finish. I'm 25 now. It is definitely doable. There's a ton of people in my class who are in their late twenties or older. Just do what you can and keep working towards what you want. I really thought I'd never get in, but I decided to keep pushing when I realized there was really nothing else I wanted to do. I'm so glad I did that because I love nursing. I was even told I'd flunk out since I barely passed anatomy, but that hasn't been the case at all. I got a 3.5 my first semester and this semester I have pretty much all A's.   I'd focus on your main pre-reqs. Anatomy, physio, micro, and chem. Then move onto the other ones. If you're comfortable with it even take some of the other pre-reqs online. I took lifespan development, psych, and nutrition online. I focused on what school I wanted to go to, finished the pre-reqs, and applied. It's overwhelming looking at a bunch of schools at once with all different requirements. I applied to a school with rolling admissions so I could apply whenever and get in whatever semester was available at that time."
StudentNurse,3dfk14,Sunflowerslove,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:27:42 2015 UTC,"I started in august of 2012. At that time to enter into the program i had to do like 9-11 prerequisites.   Come year 2013 everything changed and now they only required 4 classes to apply, but you had to finish 4 other prerequisites before finishing the RN program. I also had a baby in june of 2013, Im married with to kiddos currently. I decided to wait a year before applying to the RN to give the baby a year or so to ""grow up"".   So in the mean time i just completed my BSN prerequisites so i can go straight into my bsn program right after graduating the nursing program. I'll also add that in order to even be considered for the rn program you have to have a 4.0 and the classes that you ""Can"" take during the nursing program they've prefer you take them prior, and have a 4.0. This included a&p 1 and 2, into to a&p, English, microbiology and and 3 levels of psychology.   So august of 2014 rolled around and i applied and didn't get accepted, because..... i had ONE B, in ENGLISH! so, i had to wait another 4 months and retook my english class and got accepted in january of 2015! whoo. also i did a lot of part time hours because, kids and being a stay at home mommy. working wasn't an option because boys were stuck to my boobs and they were allergic to formula.   So, here i am now, finished my first semester of nursing school and i have three more to go! whoo! I got a couple more prerequisites to complete before i finished the program, but i got plenty of summer time to complete them. But now i'm working part time during nursing school and full time during the summer. eh! it's been almost three years of schooling but jeez i'll be half way done with the nursing program by the end of the three years, and only 9 months for my bsn when i graduate.   it'll be 5 ish years of schooling but i'll have three degrees. an associates in art (for some reason ill qualify for that after graduating the rn program) my associates in nursing, and my bsn. So not to bad, especially raising a family and such."
StudentNurse,3dfk14,ialmostwon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:05:45 2015 UTC,"I hear you. Luckily my first choice school (cheapest program and best commute) had the fewest prereqs as well. Rank the schools you're choosing from and start applying when you get all the prereqs for your first choice school. If you don't get in, start working on any extra prereqs for your second choice. Otherwise - don't worry about them.  I wouldn't worry too much about getting in - just do well on your prereqs. I was in a very similar boat as you, and I got all my prereqs done no problem and got into my first choice school no problem. I only took one class a semester though (though two were accelerated summer classes). Two would probably be doable, but keep the last day to ""drop"" date in mind in case it seems to be too much. Better to drop one class and ace another than fail a class or get mediocre grades.  Don't feel hopeless, YMMV, but I found the community college classes to be much easier than the science classes I took back in the day at my four year college - which were really designed to ""weed people out."" I don't know if that was because we were actually expected to learn less content, the classes were smaller, or I was just older/wiser - but you may be in for a pleasant surprise for how tough the workload will be."
StudentNurse,3dfk14,usedtobecool84,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:57:52 2015 UTC,My whole first semester at nursing school was designed to weed people out. :-(  Unfortunately a friend was one of them.
StudentNurse,3dfk14,vigor145,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:27:55 2015 UTC,It took me about 3 years to do all of the pre-reqs over a 5 year period in which I took a few breaks. No I'm 33 and just starting my ASN program in September. I'll do a third year to get my BSN and then who knows. I struggled with Chemistry and it took finding the right teacher for me to get the grade I needed to get into this very competitive program.  It's been a long time coming but I'm really excited! Good luck!

I feel like it's so far away it will never happen. One of my friends who is a nurse has been super supportive, saying while she was in nursing school her some of her favorite classmates were in their 30s...more focused and determined, for the most part. I agree it's hard to prepare for several programs since the requirements differ somewhat, but I've narrowed it down to 2 options and I'm just going to go for it. I don't have the money right now to do it, I don't have the time...but I'm going to make both and make it work. I'm standing at the beginning of this whole thing too. I'm scared and excited."

StudentNurse,3devqn,DanKC,7,Wed Jul 15 18:54:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah be careful with already knowing how to do things. Some of the people that tend to have the hardest time are folks with experience. Its easy to fall into the trap of (how we do it in the hospital) vs (how they want us to do it)   I went through an EMT course and had worked as a Psych Tech before nursing school, use the time to help your peers learn the skills, it will strengthen your own and help your leadership skills as well.   Its weird you are actually taking the same courses again, in my program we went over similar stuff but with a application to nursing practice."

I, too, started with much more advanced coursework under my belt and find school easy. I take the extra time I have working in a lab and as a CNA and also helping other students that are struggling because they perhaps didn't have as good of a prior education as I did. Maybe you just go to an easy school. It sounds like you're only in your first semester, too. If you're such a genius, you have plenty of time to work as an EMT or CNA and get more clinical experience under your belt.   Also, good luck as a nurse if you hate black and fat people. Your arguments on /r/CoonTown are incredibly shallow and poorly thought out. You will deserve all the pain you will have to go through treating people of other races and people that are overweight (the latter constitutes a large portion of the hospital population, if you haven't noticed).  I just wish your patients luck surviving such a hateful, cocky and simultaneously dumb nurse. You're a prime example of exactly who shouldn't be going into medicine. I certainly hope you're never my nurse!"
StudentNurse,3devqn,Notinmyhous,2,Fri Jul 17 23:10:21 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is figuring out how to explain things like diabetes (type 1 vs type 2, and even gestational diabetes) in a simple, yet complete terms - to someone who maybe has no prior knowledge of the human body and how it works. Like: what's a pancreas? What does it do when it functions normally vs abnormally? What exactly are glucagon and insulin? What is insulin resistance? What happens/how does the body respond (physically/chemically) when a person isn't making or isn't properly using insulin?   The reason I suggest this is bc you need to understand common disease processes well enough to explain them thoroughly to someone who lacks understanding - specifically, patients and their families. Furthermore, you will need to explain treatments/medications, and so on.   What about a husband who has questions about his wife's STEMI (heart attack) or ischemic stroke.. can you explain what happened while still answering his questions in terms that are subject sensitive and understandable based on his education level?   Try it out - use the voice recorder on your phone and see how well you do.. (if not about those topics, about any topic you're currently studying..)  Rather than being frustrated, use this time to be proactive and do something positive with your education. You have to be strong in this material, that's why it's reinforced so much. So, quiz yourself - how well do you actually know it? A written exam can only prove so much.   Edit: missed a word"

StudentNurse,3devqn,charlottethespider,2,Thu Jul 16 00:40:57 2015 UTC,"Well, for the average person in nursing school the repetitiveness is key for retention. They hammer in the basic things you'll encounter most frequently/need to know. For the above average person like yourself, I'd imagine you'll end up in acute care and go back to school for an advanced degree, if it's not already your plan. CRNA, DNP, PhD. Whatever rocks your boat.."
StudentNurse,3devqn,RNthrowawayRN,2,Thu Jul 16 06:15:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, nursing school can be repetitive and subjects often overlap, but there is a reason for that. You seem smart enough to figure out this reason."

Until now, I couldn't figure out what people meant when they were talking about how competitive the program is.     should I switch to CNA or do volunteer work to get patient care experiene,   I will say... ABSOLUTELY.  The best nurses I know were former CNAs.  It will also help in clinicals.

When we visited a Hospice during my clinical rotations we had a lot of the Hospice nurses tell us, ""I never wanted to go into Hospice nursing when I was a student. But knowing I can help people pass away in the most peaceful and fulfilling way possible - that is beyond rewarding."" Or something to that effect; and I believe it.  Personally, I'd probably never work in Pediatrics. Nothing against kids, I just don't think I'm a great kids person. I know a lot of people that are excellent at working with children; I'd much rather a Peds patient get one of them as a nurse over me."

StudentNurse,3dbm0k,tidderuoykcuf,3,Wed Jul 15 17:04:10 2015 UTC,"I think just be honest about why you want to work there. Have the story worked out so the delivery is fluid, esp if there's a specific reason why you want to go into hospice (personal experience with hospice is common). Honesty, tactfulness, calmness, these things seem to go a long way in hospice.  From what I can tell, one of the most important aspects of hospice vs hospital in terms of care is that the patient's desires become of utmost importance. They are in charge, to the best of their capacity, of how they want to proceed in the process in terms of medication. When I first started volunteering, I felt a little ""off"" about immediately responding to anxiety with large doses of medication. But I've had nurses tell me stories that essentially explain that my personal agenda and beliefs about the dying process need to be put aside; there is no right or wrong; what's most important is respecting the patient's wishes in their last hours. If a patient is done with all the pain and ready for the unconscious phase, then so be it. Although some nurses would skip out on explaining to family that this is the last moment for coherent conversation, and I've heard some family wishing they had known. Anyways, sorry for side rant.  I don't know how extensive the interview is. But a useful tip I got about questions regarding negatives, like what will I struggle with in work, etc., it's best to have an answer ready that includes both something you're struggling with, and what you're already doing to alleviate it. For example, I have a lot of issues with speaking in public, but I've joined toast master's and am taking an online course in public speaking. Stuff like that."

Personally I learned from a step down unit that I couldn't work in the ICU and even the step down unit was burning me out with how insanely acute our patient population was and how little we could help as nurses because of factors totally out of ours and the patients control .  That's why I moved to the OR because at least for the most part people come in with a problem and they leave better than when they got there.  The same cannot be said for many patients on the ICU/DOU floors and it was too hard for me psychologically.  I would much rather do hospice than go back to the floor if I ever got tired of the operating room"

StudentNurse,3dbxxe,gingerhater21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:44:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone recommending the official ATI book (I got the package that included the online tests too). Here was my study method.   Take first practice test. Go through sections of the book in order of worst scoring section to best scoring section (I had limited time to study, so if I didn't get through everything, I wanted to be sure I at least focused on my worst areas). Take second practice test. Review rationales for what you missed. Take the two computer practice tests (space them out before the exam). Get good night sleep and good breakfast before actual test.   The TEAS is really not that difficult. If she passed her prereqs, English is her first language, and can do BASIC math, it shouldn't be too much trouble. I'd hold off on buying the extra books until you take the second practice test. If you're still struggling, maybe get another book, but it's also one of those tests where the best thing to do for your score is just practice taking the test.  Good luck!"
StudentNurse,3d98e6,The_Real_Ralph_Nader,2,Tue Jul 14 14:19:37 2015 UTC,"I'm about to start the one in Indianapolis. The staff are extremely supportive and helpful and a lot the grads apparently get picked up by the hospitals they do clinicals at. I'm in an online Marian class right now and I think it's well done. I like the hybrid format because of the flexibility. The Nashville one is newer but should be very similar. Keep in mind that it's hybrid, not totally online."
StudentNurse,3d98e6,pengigirl14,3,Tue Jul 14 14:56:24 2015 UTC,What approach do they take to teaching? Is it independent reading plus recorded lectures and/or guided modules or do students basically teach themselves in a flipped type of classroom? What are exams like? How study intensive is the program? I'm mostly concerned about pharmacology since that was the only course I kind of struggled with the first time around.
StudentNurse,3d98e6,pengigirl14,2,Tue Jul 14 15:54:10 2015 UTC,"It's mostly guided modules and discussions in the class that I am now.  I haven't started the nursing coursework yet, just finishing up the prerecs now.  I have met a large number of the current students though and it is still an intense program since it is accelerated, but very doable.  They all say that the instructors are very approachable and responsive.  I have had a great experience so far and the students I met seemed to enjoy it too.  That being said, I am not entirely sure how the Nashville campus functions as it is farther removed from the main Indianapolis campus.  What it really comes down to is how do you learn best?  It's a very independent style, but you are not alone."
StudentNurse,3d98e6,azbartender,4,Tue Jul 14 23:49:36 2015 UTC,"Did you expect a for profit institution to tell you that their grads don't get hired???  Do a search on allnurses.com, pretty poor reviews for this program..."
StudentNurse,3d98e6,pengigirl14,2,Tue Jul 14 21:19:39 2015 UTC,"According to what I've heard since posting this, Saint Thomas hires a lot of their grads. I usually take online reviews of anything with a grain of salt, especially when it concerns an educational program that is in a format that could be seen as desirable by people with less than stellar ability in the first place. One must wonder how much of a person's job hunt difficulties can be attributed to their own shortcomings instead of the institution that issued their degree. Marian's online programs have better first time NCLEX pass rates than most other Universities in my state at ~90%.  It's also worth mentioning that Marian University is not a for-profit university. They've been around for ages and the fact that they have satellite programs out of state from their home campus doesn't make them any less legit than any other university. They have a medical school for crying out loud. A far cry from DeVry or University of Phoenix. If a hiring manager is ignorant enough to toss an application because it listed Marian University and they believe it to be a degree mill, I wouldn't want to work for them anyways because that kind of misinformation is inexcusable in the digital age."
StudentNurse,3d98e6,Sunflowerslove,2,Wed Jul 15 14:26:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly what you said. From what I understand, it's their normal, well established nursing program, but in a new format. I did a lot of research before making my choice."
StudentNurse,3d98e6,azbartender,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:35:09 2015 UTC,"I'd do a lot of research. I'd be a little weary of any online BSN programs. I know online BSN programs for your first nursing degree was really frowned upon in California. I'm in a program in missouri right now and don't know the take on it here, but I'd just be careful with it. As /u/azbartender said, check out allnurses to see what people say about them and I'd also check out their nclex pass rate on the state board website. I would try to find out the amount of students they accept per year, the amount of students that graduate per year, the amount of students who pass boards, and the percentage of hires."

StudentNurse,3d7qlu,ManWhoisAlsoNurse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:24:47 2015 UTC,"As for certifications and whatnot to help get into the ICU.. here's what I recommend:   Join the AACN - American Association of Critical-Care Nurses .. this shows your seriousness/dedication to not only nursing, but the specific branch of nursing.  If you are an RN, the price to join for 1 year is $78.00, students have a cheaper rate, and if you have been a member for 5+ years, your membership costs go down.  There are a lot of benefits to joining - just check out the website for info.  Certification in BLS/CPR (if you're not already) - this is a certification that you will be required to have no matter what unit you're on. Certification in ACLS - Advanced cardiac life support Certification in PALS - Pediatric advanced life support (may not be essential unless you will be working in a pediatric ICU) NIH Stroke Cert - I believe you can do this online for $10. Google it.  Pulmonary and Ventilator Course  - A class that will offer detailed information on ventilator issues, how to recognize high and low pressure alarms, resolve equipment and/or patient issues ... etc. Also, there are courses that are designed to teach on care of the tracheostomy patient - so you may also be interested in that as well. 12 Lead EKG Certification Course  IV Therapy and Blood Withdrawal Course     As for volunteering - I would suggest a program (nursing/health related) that requires you to do X amount of hours  within X time frame (usually something like 100-300 hours within a year.)   Edit: spelling"

I mean I would much prefer a traditional lecture program so that makes me happy that they do it the normal way too. I'm pretty wary of online learning because I tend to ask a lot of questions in lectures so I suspect that would make it difficult."
StudentNurse,3d6zvv,californiapedsnurse,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:06:39 2015 UTC,Yeah their BSN/MSN program includes an accelerated 15 month program on campus and you do received the BSN after 15 months. They want you to work for a few years and then come back for part 2 (the MSN) but I'm not sure you actually have to do that.

StudentNurse,3d6n8z,superpony123,2,Mon Jul 13 22:58:42 2015 UTC,"Almost all the hospitals around me require CNA license to be a nursing aide (although it seems one does not, so applying for that).   Get your CNA and work as a CNA.  I'm in the accelerated BSN program for second degree students.  I feel my CNA experience has been invaluable to me.  Despite being a cohort of second degree students, somewhere between a third to half of us are currently working as CNAs.  Some are at hospitals and then there are people like me who work at a Geriatric Rehab / Long Term Care / Hospice facility.     I need to be making more than $10/hr, ya know?   My facility pays $11 per hour, but if I was willing to work Agency (i.e. working where-ever, whenever some place is low staffed...) I could make $15 an hour.  It is the same job, but I like having the stability of knowing where I'm going to be.   It is not worth my time or money to go get certified for something, because those classes take several months   My CNA class cost $625, took two and half weeks and the company I work for reimburses the full amount after working for one year."
StudentNurse,3d6n8z,CertifiedAssWiper,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:08:31 2015 UTC,"Where I am (NJ), all the CNA classes are at community colleges and take place over an entire semester (~3 months versus 2 weeks for you) and cost over $1,000. If doing a CNA class was only 2 weeks I would already be signed up but because it is July, and my contract for my current job (security) ends at the end of August, and I will be starting an ABSN program in January, I cannot spend the next several months taking a class when I need to be working. I totally wish I had the opportunity before to do the CNA class perhaps over a summer but I always had to work full time and/or take prereq classes for the ABSN. I definitely see how useful having the CNA cert and experience would be but given the way it seems to work around here, but I can't help but think I would be wasting money (I don't have much to begin with, I will go broke if I don't work full time) because by the time I would be finished with the CNA classes, it would be time for me to start nursing school anyway--so I wouldnt even get the chance to work as a CNA"

I REALLY lucked up when I found my class.  It was created by the company that hired me.  They built their own, ""geriatric education center"" in order to boost the number of CNAs in the area.  It works out amazing.  I know other places around the US have similar systems.

I called multiple ""institutes"" because I was unable to find information when their classes are actually offered, and the people on the phone couldn't even tell me! (You want me to ""register"" online and pay $900 for a class when you can't even tell me when it is, how many days a week, how long it takes, how many hours per class, etc .. doesn't make any sense!!)

Also, you said you are doing an ABSN and many of your classmates also work as CNAs. Almost every single school I am applying to makes a pretty big deal of stressing that you should not be employed while completing the program. They all vary a little bit in terms of length, some are a few months longer than others, but can I ask how many months your program is and how many hours you tend to work each week? I've been operating on the impression that I will not be able to work at all, or if I do, it will be VERY few hours. I am lucky enough to have a position at my alma mater waiting for me that allows me to essentially work whenever I want, as much or as little as I want, while I am a student, but that depends on getting into their absn program which is notoriously tough unfortunately, and I'm not expecting that kind of luck at any other school in terms of part time employment."

StudentNurse,3d6n8z,tacolocooocrazy,2,Tue Jul 14 23:13:28 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I'm currently a CNA at a rehab and LTC. I'm going to my local CC to get my prereqs out of the way for nursing school. I was certified through my community college.   I understand that you need a job for only a few months but I'd highly suggest doing a CNA program.   I found this PDF from nj.gov  for approved classes in NJ for nurses aide courses. (Not sure how linking PDFs work on reddit but it may work)  I know many nurses, and a lot of them were CNAs before RNs. I may be biased, but I think they're the best kind of nurses. They have told me that they were so glad they were CNAs before starting nursing school. A nursing professor even told me that the CNA students stand out in class because they have experience, even if just a little.   Since I have been a CNA, I have learned so much more than what the class taught me. There are a few nurses at my facility that come and grab me when they are about to do a procedure so I can learn. I know how to hook up an IV, flush an IV line, suction a trach, and I've just gained so much experience just dealing with patients and their (mostly annoying) families. It's experience I wouldn't trade for a minute. I learn something new every day.  If you absolutely don't want to be a CNA beforehand, and want to get a job in the healthcare field, try looking up ""Direct Support Specialist"" on Indeed. I had a girlfriend--who has a degree in outdoor req--get a job at a youth treatment facility. It pays around 10.00 and up. It's not a super great position, but since you have a psych degree and want to get your foot in the door, it won't hurt to check it out.  Anywho, best of luck to you!"
StudentNurse,3d6n8z,usedtobecool84,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:11:49 2015 UTC,"it's not that I don't ""want"" to be a CNA--I would LOVE to be a CNA before starting school because it's a relevant job and I think it'll give me a lot of great experience--just like you have found. It's more because all the CNA classes I've found within reasonable driving distance are community college based and they take place over an entire semester--so basically if I am starting nursing school in January, by the time I finish my class I will be starting school. While I think it will be a valuable experience and help with nursing school, I need to have a full time job ideally by September that I can work at until January when school starts again. If I could find a class that is less than a month, I will definitely do that but so far I have not been able to find anything close enough that is not a several-month-long class :/  that's a really great idea about the youth treatment facility, I will look into stuff like that too!  also THANK YOU for that link! I have had a really hard time finding non-CC programs that arent shady but there are a few on this list that I haven't previously found in my google searches and seem legit so I will be doing some more research on that (like I said, I really WANT to be a CNA but at least going the community college route would be a very impractical thing for me)"

I used a book of theirs I got at the local library before my exit exams and passed easily putting me in the 98%-ile to pass the nclex. I just applied the strategy they believe in and it worked.   My school has a contract with ATI and we just did a 3 day live session with them. It was alright. Their questions one needs a certain stragety to do well which I felt is unfair for some.

Can't just use that though. Passed first try and I credit 95% of it to Kaplan.
StudentNurse,3d3cbm,shelbae814,15,Mon Jul 13 04:47:56 2015 UTC,"If you have the opportunity to start in a hospital setting, do it. You will understand the importance of time/patient management, work with a more seasoned and knowledgable nursing staff, as well as further your development of clinical terminology.   Additionally, if you have any aspirations of pursing a BSN, your experiences/interactions with patients and clinical staff will only give you a leg up once you begin clinical hours. I'd say go for it."
StudentNurse,3d3cbm,photo777,2,Mon Jul 13 05:17:38 2015 UTC,This is my plan too.
StudentNurse,3d3cbm,Annoy_Occult_Vet,5,Mon Jul 13 06:19:01 2015 UTC,"Without a doubt, start at the hospital. Experience in that setting will help you in nursing school as well (medical terminology, interdisciplinary care, equipment, etc.). I've worked at a nursing home for a few years as a CNA. I'm in my last year of my BSN program and I just got a job per diem as a tech in a hospital. If I was in your situation, knowing what I know now, I would've started at the hospital."
StudentNurse,3d3cbm,Jeffrai,3,Mon Jul 13 05:55:41 2015 UTC,"Since you have the opportunity to start at a hospital DO IT. That chance doesn't come around everyday. You will learn so much more in the hospital, have better coworkers and can have a potential job when you become an RN already lined up because you work there. Your duties will pretty much  be the same for hospital vs. nursing home so I wouldn't worry about no experience, you know what to do. Good luck!!"
StudentNurse,3d3cbm,pickledfeet,2,Mon Jul 13 07:42:50 2015 UTC,Do it. Hospital setting work is priceless esp if you're on your way to become a nurse.   No brainer.
StudentNurse,3d3cbm,macavity_is_a_dog,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:34:51 2015 UTC,If a hospital is willing to take you n with no experience then they know you will need to start with the basics.
StudentNurse,3d3cbm,ChaplnGrillSgt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:19:49 2015 UTC,"Yep, what other folks said. Around here anyway, it can be really hard to get a tech job in a hospital without experience - heck, I have friends with tons of experience and still can't seem to get their foot in the door for an interview in a hospital.   The only note I'd say is maybe ask some of the techs about the vibes on the different shifts. At the hospital I just got hired at, many techs forewarned me that the day shift on their unit was incredibly busy, high pressure, slightly insane, etc.  Personally that kinda suits me but maybe it wouldn't have fresh out of the CNA class, not sure. (And I'm sure I'll have days where I'll wonder why I opted for that. ;))  So maybe opt for shifts that sound like the best feel for you if you have a choice."
StudentNurse,3d3cbm,Fauxliage,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:04:05 2015 UTC,"If I have a connection to work at a hospital right after I get my certification, should I?   Do you want to work as a nurse in a hospital upon graduation?  If yes, then take the hospital job.  I know several of the people at the local hospitals who are working as CNAs and have nursing jobs already lined up once they graduate."
StudentNurse,3d3cbm,CertifiedAssWiper,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:18:34 2015 UTC,"If you can get on at a hospital without experience, definitely go for that!!!  It's hard to get to one without experience first and honestly, nursing homes are just downright depressing.  Plus, hospitals typically pay way better than nursing homes."
StudentNurse,3d3cbm,panpanpanda,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:16:21 2015 UTC,Do it part time or per diem.
StudentNurse,3d3cbm,lovelyone20,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:00:38 2015 UTC,I went nursing home to hospital kinda by situation not preference. If you're 8n a BSN program is go nursing home then wait til you hit year 3 when you can be a nurse tech at a hospital. At that point hospital 100%.   Just my input.
StudentNurse,3d6byx,uhloreuh,9,Mon Jul 13 21:34:38 2015 UTC,Have you completed the prerequisites for and been admitted to a nursing program? You need to do that first. Pay and job market will depend on location. You will need your BSN and some experience before applying to an NP program. I would worry about getting through nursing school before worrying about a specialty. In some areas of the country the job market for nurses is dismal. The market is flooded with new grads.
StudentNurse,3d6byx,notme1414,6,Mon Jul 13 22:00:26 2015 UTC,i'd recommend just finishing the program
StudentNurse,3d6byx,zalite,5,Tue Jul 14 01:10:28 2015 UTC,Make it through your RN program before you start thinking about being a NP...
StudentNurse,3d6byx,azbartender,0,Tue Jul 14 00:52:36 2015 UTC,nothing wrong with planning ahead. nothing at all lol
StudentNurse,3d6byx,tacolocooocrazy,5,Mon Jul 20 23:08:08 2015 UTC,It really depends where you are for the market. I am a new grad and got an offer for every position I interviewed for (4 offers total). Some new grads are looking for jobs for a long while before getting hired.  To go to NP school you need your BSN. Just focus on nursing school before you focus on the specialty. You might end up falling in love with a completely different subset of nursing than you set out for. Keep an open mind.
StudentNurse,3d6byx,aliceismalice,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:57:56 2015 UTC,"I currently work on a psych unit in a CNA type of position. I'm also in nursing school.  I started out making $9.75 an hour, but I hope to get a raise in 2 weeks (hope so anyway).  The RN's make about $30 dollars an hour where I work.  I've learned a lot, and there is a huge demand for it.  we are always calling in float nurses.  In my experience in psych, they are very demanding of all PRN medications and are rarely pleased even if you do a great job meeting their needs.  There is a lot of burn out because about 90% of our patients also have a drug problem and are homeless.  Lots of drug seeking, and lots of repeat people.    I love my job, and I want to me a psych nurse.  Most of the job of the RN is listening to people and looking for non-verbal cues.  By non-verbal cues, I mean, are they restless, moving their lips with out words being said, rocking, guarding, are they bathing regularly, are they going to groups and talking with others. RNs also have to figure out if the DR orders are BS, find out if the patient is physically sick or just mentally sick (or both) , monitor for withdrawal of opids, meth, and alcohol.  So much planning and continuing of care with other people like social workers happens.  Legal aspects like 96 hour holds, who brought them in, are the capable of making legal decisions, are they voluntary with doctor's order?  RNs ARE THE PATIENTS ADVOCATE,  The RN spends day and night with the patients.  The doctors, social workers, and managers are not with them 24 hours a day.  Patients like to put up a front so they can go back to their ""normal"" life.  Its the nurses job to make sure they get what they need, which may not be what they want.  (I did an externship, and followed a RN for a full month).    The NP talks 1 on 1 with the PT and writes scrips and gives diagnosis (also note, I don't talk with the NPs very much as a tech/student).  Get some time under your belt.  Go to clinical and learn the other floors too.  If you cant put up with extreme attitudes of patients at clinical, don't get into psych.  Every patient is a psych patient and bed-side manor is so important.   Don't be a nurse in an area you don't like, even if it pays well.  Its not worth it.  $1000 a year more isn't worth hating your job.    Medsurg is always looking for people.  ALWAYS.  CRNA is the best pay I think.  But listen to your gut on what you like best.  CRNA isn't for everyone, medsurg isn't for everyone, and psych isn't for everyone.  Just have fun at clinical and figure out what you're interested in."

StudentNurse,3d2nhh,shelbae814,3,Mon Jul 13 01:06:00 2015 UTC,Chill as hard as you can. I went to Nicaragua for a month before I started nursing school - a great decision in hindsight. You'll have time to learn and study while actually in school.   But yeah get that Saunders book.   I graduate in 5 weeks. Good luck to the best decision you'll ever make.
StudentNurse,3d2nhh,macavity_is_a_dog,8,Mon Jul 13 02:05:52 2015 UTC,"Relax. Spend time with your friends and family. Review some medications, but don't go overboard.

I am also a big planner and the path I took and what I do now is not what I originally thought I would do or be doing.  I agree. Live outside of work and school but don't forget about school. Plan yes, but do most importantly. Plan on reviewing but do it. Make plans with family and friends and follow through."
StudentNurse,3d2nhh,ob_bijinn,2,Mon Jul 13 02:01:40 2015 UTC,"I'm starting in August too, and the best advice I got was to get your life in order. Get your house clean, get your study area and materials organized, get a gym routine down, clear your life and home of clutter so your mind can be clear when you start. I've been spending time getting all my kids clothes and bedrooms organized and cleaning out my basement. I already feel less stressed and ready to dive in."
StudentNurse,3d2nhh,Fauxliage,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:25:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with above, relax. I felt the same way, and my nursing program recommended a couple of books to go over before school started so a fair chunk of my summer = working full time + picking up extra shifts + reading recommended nursing stuff in my free time. Really one book was just like a glorified ""how to be a good nursing student"" and not really much help and the other book, on dosage calculations, we had plenty of time to read when the semester started and they had optional sessions to teach the material.  It wasn't a huge deal, but really the best thing would have been to chill and enjoy my free time.   I would say at best, do your homework about what apps you want to use, how you want to organize your info/notes, etc ahead of time, so you have everything all lined up instead of fumbling around a week or two into the semester. Like maybe a week ahead of time, if you get the syllabi early, put the assignments into a calendar/app/whatever you want to use to keep track of that, so when classes start you are doing reading/assignments, not tedious busy work.  Even if a few dates get tweaked later, it's still not much time compared to the initial input of all that. I had seven classes my first semester so lots of dates to keep track of. :)   Hope you enjoy the rest of your summer!"

StudentNurse,3d2nhh,CalvinsStuffedTiger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:32:14 2015 UTC,"Relax, get a work out routine, binge netflix, eat healthy, stock-pile sleep. Make a ton of food and freeze it - it will keep for a few months, and then you have some already made meals for the days you don't have time/energy to cook. You won't have time for these soon.  The best thing I did to prepare for nursing school was to take a medical terminology class. Nursing lectures can feel like a whole new language until you learn the jargon, so a 1-credit online class (or even just looking up medical terminology on quizlet) can really help you feel more comfortable."

If they mention the nurse does blah blah at 10 AM, the time means something. 10 minutes post procedure vs 24 hours post procedure is important to consider. A post-partum mother question that has nothing to do with post-partum care is important to consider.   You get the picture. Sometimes the answer is right there in the question. NCLEX wants you to pass.   I took 2.5 hours for 75 questions. I really thought everything through. Half of my test was SATA and I believe that's because I was doing very well. It was hard, just think it through.  Remember - you got this! Be confident and don't study the day before the test."

StudentNurse,3cyo09,luminarydiamond,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:35:29 2015 UTC,"HESI or similar testing is common practice in nursing school. Why would anyone go to an unaccredited For Profit school?  Most for profit schools offer online only nursing school and because of the lack of real clinical hours, nurses can't be licensed. Or if you somehow manage to take the boards and become licensed, you will have no real experience doing your skills. So many hospitals will not hire you."

StudentNurse,3cozgl,_Emi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:39:26 2015 UTC,It was easy. I was really nervous before so I screamed in my car. I told myself if I could pass nursing school I could pass this. There were tough questions and that's a bit discouraging but I knew that meant I was in the higher level questions and doing good.

StudentNurse,3coot1,TerraFermata,2,Thu Jul 9 15:25:35 2015 UTC,"I wrote the NCLEX 2 days ago and passed in 75 questions. First and foremost I recommend the kaplan qbank, I did something like 86% of it and found the NCLEX to have a very similar style of questions. I also practiced quite a few questions from the prioritization book and would recommended that as it's a pretty big section of the NCLEX and the questions can be tough. I had access to the Elsevier adaptive quizzing through school and used it a bit, but I found the questions were mostly content based so it was useful for review but not for the critical thinking type questions you'd expect on the NCLEX. Good luck!"
StudentNurse,3coot1,char-mander,2,Thu Jul 9 17:14:46 2015 UTC,"I took the NCLEX April 13 and passed in 75 questions. I studied lightly for the two weeks (maybe 10 hours a week) after I graduated (3/20/15), took a vacation to Vegas, then hit the ""books"" hard for six days (6-10 hours a day of questions and rationales), took the evening off before my exam and just reviewed a few notes right before going in, these were my resources:    Kaplan Question Bank - Did all of the question trainers and read every rationale, also watched some of the online videos that help with answer elimination and selection.   NCSBN- Did about 25% of the question bank and used their modules for NCLEX section review (I was scoring consistently low in management of care so did this module - I like NCSBN because it breaks down your scores by NCLEX question type rather than nursing school subject)  Saunders/textbooks- Content review (minimal) and content specific questions (also minimal, used this to brush up on pharm and some management of care topics)   My best advice would be to accept that you generally know what you're going to know for this test at this point. Your program should have prepared you well content wise - you can't know everything, but you likely know plenty.  Focus on answering questions, it's such a mental test and practicing answering thousands of questions is your best bet for success. Work on eliminating answers and strategies to pick when you're not sure. Kaplan online course is great for this, but there are tons of tips around online that are valuable (for example, a statement that has ""always"" or ""never"" is incorrect more often than not, if two statements are very similar one of those two is often the correct answer and your job is to decide which slight difference makes one correct and one incorrect, etc.)  Good luck! In the end it was not nearly as traumatic as I had convinced myself it would be, and overall the questions were easier than those I studied (especially the select all that apply which I had loads of)."

StudentNurse,3coot1,tessln26,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:20:34 2015 UTC,"I did the Hurst Review (meh, it had SOME helpful stuff but the questions were not really similar to NCLEX) and evolve adaptive quizzing. The questions in evolve that were most like the NCLEX were the ""Client Needs"" section. However I also tried to get a mastery level of 2 or greater in all the subtopics (cardiovascular, newborn, psychiatric, etc.) I feel that Evolve was most helpful. About 5 days before the NCLEX I would periodically throughout the day do questions on evolve(as i was studying hurst). I did 100-150 questions a day AND read the reasoning behind answers. I passed the NCLEX in 75 questions. Honestly, I think the NCLEX is more about strategy than nursing knowledge."

UWorld has some free trial links floating around and I would recommend taking advantage!"
StudentNurse,3cgyei,firepiggymonkfish,15,Tue Jul 7 20:49:47 2015 UTC,"I am a pretty quiet, introverted person in my normal life. I have to kind of fake being an extrovert at work. It is exhausting and part of the reason I only work twice a week. It has gotten easier as time goes on, having confidence helps. People want their nurse to be friendly and approachable, and sometimes being quiet and nonexpressive comes across as rude or standoffish. It might feel theatrical at first, but just step out of your comfort zone a little bit.   As for the meds. Work on memorizing the classes of meds and common parameters, side effects and action. Once you give them a lot it will come naturally and you will just have to look up the uncommon ones. You definitely should know what a med is for, why the person is getting it and what needs to be monitored before administering it. I am not sure how your clinical day is structured, but when I was in school I used to get my assignment, sit down and look at their diagnosis and look up any meds they would be getting that I was unfamiliar with. Then I would go introduce myself and do whatever I needed to do (vitals, AM care, etc).   It's good to have a notebook, but you don't have to bring it everywhere with you. If you have a small one, keep it in your pocket and just pull it out when you need to reference something, don't completely rely on it. Work on trying to memorize the important stuff about your patients. One day you may have 6+ patients at a time and need to know things about them off the top of your head when a doctor, family member, case management, or PT/OT asks you a question.  Try not to take your instructor's criticism too hard. Unless she told you that you are in danger of failing, you don't need to get all bent out of shape about it. Just take her constructive criticism and learn from it and try to use it to better yourself. She is just trying to help you become a nurse, no one is perfect and everyone needs some pointers along the way.  Good luck!"
StudentNurse,3cgyei,wicksa,9,Tue Jul 7 21:31:32 2015 UTC,"I tend to be very quiet, even more so when I'm out of my element. When I started externing I had a patient i needed to assess, so i asked him if i could listen to his lungs etc and he gave me a speech about stepping up and taking control of the room. He told me ""when you walk into this room, you're the boss. So don't ask me if you can do your job, tell me you're going to do it."" I realized how important it is to be respectful, but also to step up and be confident in what I'm doing when I walk onto the floor.  He ended up being one of my all-time favorite patients and he really helped me gain confidence in my abilities."
StudentNurse,3cgyei,Wayward-Soul,9,Wed Jul 8 05:30:12 2015 UTC,"I'm an entirely different person at work, and that includes being much more outgoing and friendly.  Personally I actually like it because it helps me separate my personal life from work, because in many ways they are totally separate lives.  As for learning meds and other tidbits it's really individual.  Some people learn by reading material, others by writing it out, flash cards work for a lot of people, and people like me learn by talking it out, either in a group or clinical, and applying it.  There are a million different ways to do it, so I'd try a few different methods until something works.    Also you have discovered the difference between lecture and clinical.  In lecture it's usually about big concepts, so knowing the generalized side effects of ACE inhibitors is important, but in clinical you're expected to look it up and know the exact side effects, or unique properties of, lisinopril.  You don't need to permanently memorize it necessarily, but you should know about the specific meds that you are giving, not just the class and the 30,000 foot view."
StudentNurse,3cgyei,justatouchcrazy,2,Wed Jul 8 00:15:03 2015 UTC,"I'm really timid with patients, but what I've found helps is smiling a lot. Whenever I talk to any of my patients or ask them any questions, I try to smile. Well, as long as it's appropriate. Some situations just aren't smiling appropriate haha. I also find the easiest thing to do is to appease instructors or just ask questions. When I'm getting conflicting information between lecture and clinicals, I ask my clinical instructor to explain what she expects from me and what I can do to be better at that. This way she notices I'm trying and people like when you ask their advice.   As for drugs, I still have trouble with drugs. I remember little things, but not the main picture. My clinical instructor recommended learning the classes and learning the bigger picture behind each drug class. You can't be expected to remember thousands of drug names and each side effect, implication, etc for each individual drug. If I don't know a drug and I'm in clinical, I'll look it up before passing meds."
StudentNurse,3cgyei,Sunflowerslove,2,Wed Jul 8 02:33:14 2015 UTC,"I don't have any advice for you about the personality question, but just wanted to tell you that I'm experiencing the same thing! However it's not usually with patients. I am introverted, not shy. I am not scared to talk to people, I just prefer to be quiet if I have nothing significant to add to the conversation. I can be friendly and talk to patients and I'm comfortable with them. My problem is I don't participate in banter with the nurses who are working at my clinical site. I'm not trying to be unfriendly, I'm trying to stay out of their way. I know that it's not their job to help me out. I have an assigned nurse that I ask questions, but I have trouble being loud and cracking jokes in a place that  trying to learn and be professional. I've been told by a couple nurses that I seem nervous/timid, when I'm just trying to concentrate and soak up information. I guess I'm just going to have to force myself to banter a little more so I seem more personable! It's annoying though, because that takes away from what I retain :/ good luck!"

I have bright hair and tattoos and some mentors have not liked it (even though it's not against trust property). Bit sooner rather than later I have won them over with knowledge and skill.   I think the medication knowledge is something to look in to when you have time. As for being behind your books and stuff, well try knowing the stuff before the clinicals but keeping a pocket book with you as a safety net. I have a little book in my pocket and if I feel lost I say, ""whoa, hold up a second"" and I get my little book out, make notes and ask questions. No one can know it all so don't let the pressure of being put on the spot bother you, just learn from it. I'm currently on a Critical care unit, I feel so thick but I am learning :)   Good luck"
StudentNurse,3cgyei,Neffer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:24:42 2015 UTC,"This is a great question.   Yes- there is 'Nurse MWAH' and 'Mom MWAH' and every other incarnation of me, and I've learned to keep them distinctly separate.   Normal me is packed away neatly when I'm in 'Work/Nurse mode'-- I aim to express 'Super Nurse'. I'm calm, confident, sure in my actions and words. Inside though 'Tired, hungry, unhappy/worried/scared/freaked out- me' might be going full tilt, but I don't let it show- I guess the best way to describe it is that when I go 'work mode' it's like wearing a mask.   I find that I need that separation in order to leave work at work and home at home. It really helps with not getting too personally attached to my patients.  As for needing to know things on demand- that's part of the real world- it's usually generalities that they're asking for, and they'd be asking for pertinent things at time of administration.  If you're going to administer a drug or a treatment, you need to know it backwards and forwards before it goes into/onto the patient.   You don't necessarily have to change who you are, but you have to grow and adjust to your new role as a nurse."
StudentNurse,3cgyei,MamaWasAHamster,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:58:25 2015 UTC,"I have decided that some instructors push some students harder because they see the potential you have (that you may not even recognize you have, and try to bring it out in you in ""harsh"" ways).. it's not to be mean to you, it's not to make you question your abilities, or make you feel incompetent (although, believe me, I know sometimes it can feel that way! But it's to make you rise up to the occasion.   In clinicals if you don't know the answer, never say IDK rather, you should say ""that's a good question, let me look it up and get back to you on that!"" ... look up the answer, and go back to the instructor and tell them what you looked up!   My best advice is that when you get to clinical - first get report on your patient(s) - after doing so, get on the computer and see what meds they are on via the MAR (the MAR should provide a section where you can look up what each med is for, cause as nurses, we don't always know or sometimes forget all the facts about meds too!) Also, check up on their labs - will their labs affect whether or not you will give the meds? If it's a blood pressure medication, always make sure you know the parameters the doctor has set.. etc.   Hope that helps a bit."

StudentNurse,3cj2v3,brownsn1,3,Wed Jul 8 10:56:24 2015 UTC,I'm going to second this. While a medical based job helps with the medical side of things sometimes having a good foundation in people skills is even better.

The job provided much more exposure to the field than I ever would have imagined, and between plugging away at the front desk for just over 1.5 years, and then becoming a tech (I got my EMT-B cert to do it), I'm feeling pretty confident in my choice to go to nursing school and my skills going in (giving injections, drawing blood, EKGs, splinting, medication instructions, general history taking/assessment, etc.).  That said, there are certainly nursing homes that will train you for a CNA-type position. Hospitals will hire people without any cert for call center or patient transport work."
StudentNurse,3cj2v3,Cherito47,4,Wed Jul 8 17:43:52 2015 UTC,Patient sitter and patient transport jobs might be good places to start. (Though patient sitting can be a bit tedious and in some hospitals the transporters are all volunteers.)

Get a job that will be flexible with your schooling because school will ultimately come first. :)

A lot of patients are on different diets (diabetic, low fat, liquid, etc.).  I also learned about different tube feedings. This hospital actually had a menu that people could order from everyday...so I don't think every hospital has this job."

StudentNurse,3cgos4,Pumpkin214,3,Tue Jul 7 21:10:12 2015 UTC,"Congrats on getting accepted and taking the next step in improving our healthcare system, I am sure that your will be awesome in school. I will provide your some key tips that will help you along your journey through school to becoming a safe healthcare professional.   1: I get rest, get organized, and clear your mind of the daily clutter that you normally deal with. I say this because most people say they cannot focus in class or read healthcare books, but the truth is that your mind is competing with your studying. A great audio book to listen to is The Power of Now by E. Tolle this will help you clear your mind and get focus.  2: In nursing school, it is difficult simply to take notes and its more difficult for students to find time to go through the current lecture. You must ask yourself, how committed are your to actually listening to a lecture twice or three times for every class. For me, I found this in effective unless I was absent. I believe on of the best techniques to learn is writing in shorthand and to review your class information before class because by review before class you now have a good understanding of the content. With shorthand, you can now write the most important and relevant content needs.  3: During this time, only focus on your class work and don't get caught up with studying for NCLEX because the truth is that your class work at this time is more important than trying to prepare for the boards.  4: Observe on the first day of class students with actual experience such as LPN, EMT, Paramedics. These students will give you a great insight into the field and your studies that you may not have though of at this point.  In any event, I hope that what i am providing you with you will ponder and consider. Good luck on your journey."
StudentNurse,3cgos4,nurseintuition,2,Wed Jul 8 11:32:24 2015 UTC,"Audio with phone, tablet, or whatever you can get your hands on. I lived by this. I just paid attention in class without taking notes and just absorbed as much as possible and then went home and transcribed the lecture then. This way you hear it twice and by writing/typing lecture you get another form of learning.  Also, I added stuff and pictures from book to my notes.   Yes this time consuming but for me it was VERY effective.  Good luck!"

I learned from recording my patho lectures that I would never go back and re-listen to them anyway.. lol.   Also, I speak from experience that it doesn't matter what was said in lecture - the exams never cover the exact same things anyway. If you can just take enough notes to know the gist of what was said/covered.. so that you can go home and study more in depth on your own - you'll probably be fine for the quizzes/exams."
StudentNurse,3cgos4,destroyingtocreate,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:05:30 2015 UTC,"Lately I've just been using some generic well-rated voice recording app I found in the app store.   Notability is also nice for iPad owners taking notes on it - a friend of mine in another nursing program recommended it and it's pretty cool - it syncs up what you are typing with the recording so if you  go back later and want to rehear what was said exactly when you typed ____, you just click on the text and hit play.   I've never done a video recording, don't think any of my friends have either. A couple of my professors have recorded their lectures using a program where you could see the powerpoints as you listened to them talking, which was nice.  How handy having the recordings though really varies from class to class. Some classes I basically never used them because time spent relistening vs benefit just didn't add up. In that case I might make a study guide, then record myself reading the study guide and play that on commutes. I had one class last semester though where lectures were so oriented to the exams and questions were so straight forward that basically relistening to the lectures was enough to ace the test.   Good luck!!"
StudentNurse,3cgos4,Fauxliage,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:00:58 2015 UTC,I used an app on my phone in my microbiology class and it worked great! Maybe try sitting in the front of the room. I'm sure that helped my recordings.
StudentNurse,3cgos4,Heavy_Hearted,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:53:14 2015 UTC,I'm still waiting to find out if we can record our lectures.

StudentNurse,3cgos4,MrsVonWooter,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:43:18 2015 UTC,"Notability if you have an iPad. You can import slides/PDFs directly into the app from Safari and write/annotate/draw/highlight on them while also recording audio. The best part is that your annotations are grayed while listening back, and the words are typed/drawn as the audio progresses and even as you scrub. In other words, the audio is lock in place with exactly where and what you annotated. It's brilliant."
StudentNurse,3ce1m4,12345alone,15,Tue Jul 7 04:36:52 2015 UTC,"You're not alone in your feelings. I'm in an accelerated BSN program and it's hard, especially studying through the summer. Everyone is having fun and making money and here I sit studying every minute I can to stay afloat, trying to pass and pay the bills. It's tough and I had a hard time my first term, and it is now slightly more manageable. Luckily, I have a supportive nursing cohort; do you have anyone in your class you can befriend and open up with? Talking to some of my classmates I found that they often feel the same way so it helps to know that you're not alone and these feelings are normal. Remember, those who post on FB and Instagram are posting their highlight reel; I'm sure they feel similar. You can send me a pm and we can chat if you'd like."
StudentNurse,3ce1m4,verrueckt_Katze_Dame,3,Tue Jul 7 05:06:30 2015 UTC,"Good call on the highlight reel, never thought of it that way!"
StudentNurse,3ce1m4,organicvegetable,2,Tue Jul 7 05:19:44 2015 UTC,"How manageable is an ABSN? I am wondering exactly how difficult it is. I have a BS in biochemistry and I did very well in it, as reference."
StudentNurse,3ce1m4,FartingWhooper,2,Tue Jul 7 14:44:15 2015 UTC,Our program had students with biology degrees and other science degrees. They didn't do any worse than other students they also didn't do any better. Nursing is completely different from anything else. It's it's own study. There was one student who was a lawyer and went back to nursing school because she hated court so much. She couldn't get an A to save her life - maintained B/C average.   It probably depends on the program but in my experience my peers with science degrees didn't have any advantage over the others once the actual nursing courses started.
StudentNurse,3ce1m4,Hashtaglibertarian,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:12:51 2015 UTC,"But the courses itself are not over the top ridiculous. I mean, an ABSN is something people can do without wanting to blow their brains out?"
StudentNurse,3ce1m4,FartingWhooper,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:28:44 2015 UTC,"LOL I think it depends on your tolerance. But I haven't met a single person that went through my program that didn't have some mental breakdowns along the way. Crying during a test, getting violently ill and not recovering for weeks, we all admitted to crying or being mean to our spouses over school work, some even went inpatient at the mental hospital attached to our hospital. I can't say there was a single semester I didn't cry uncontrollably for a good week."
StudentNurse,3ce1m4,Hashtaglibertarian,7,Wed Jul 8 00:06:41 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain. Nursing is a difficult program, but failing once does not make you a failure. Even if you were to fail again (not saying you will)--it's your determination to succeed that will keep you going. Whenever I feel burnt out I try and remember why I got into nursing in the first place. I think about all of the good things I've done so far, and how they motivate me to keep pushing forward and doing better. Remind yourself of what you've accomplished, and what your goals for the future are. School is temporary. Try keeping a positive outlook on your learning. Every time you learn a new skill, read a new chapter, interact with a patient/fellow nurse/doctor, you are becoming a better and better nurse. All of this information will not only help you, but your future patients. You will be/are making a difference in people's lives, never forget that.  Hope this helps!"
StudentNurse,3ce1m4,corona_rosarum,5,Tue Jul 7 05:21:00 2015 UTC,"I know how you feel! Nursing school is tough! I have failed 2 of my classes but never gave up! It took me some readjusting and realizing what i really wanted in life, and just learning how to balance my life and my studying habits.   But now i can say I am thriving! I have 2 more semesters 2 go and I will be an RN early 2016!  DOnt give up! Just look at the light at the end of the tunnel! Keep reminding yourself why you are doing this!   You are suffering now, but think about how happy, and comfortable you are going to be when you are done with school, and you will be making more money than your friends are now. You are going to be the happier one now. NOTHING In LIFE IS EASY! Good things come to those that don't give up, and work hard!!!!"
StudentNurse,3ce1m4,snakesayan,5,Tue Jul 7 05:33:15 2015 UTC,"throughout my nursing school, I didn't have a single friend in the program or that was a nurse. I really don't make friends easily, and it was difficult for me to try on top of everything else.  I can understand feeling like there is no one there who can understand what you're going through or be a support throughout it.  That feeling of exhaustion may not really wear off (it didn't for me), but as long as you keep going, eventually you turn around and it's already al over (which is what happened to me).  May not be as good as having aphysical friend, but feel free to message me if you ever need, and post here if you want so we can all support one another."
StudentNurse,3ce1m4,Syrup_Chugger_3000,6,Tue Jul 7 12:32:14 2015 UTC,"You're definitely not alone. Because my RPN program is a January start, I'm currently in class + working part time + clinical until mid August. I don't sleep much, I'm generally a miserable human when I have to wake up, I'm eating crap, smoking (plan to quit is for the last day of consolidation) more than usual, and generally have no time for myself. I'm watching my classmates start to breakdown publicly, and about 25% of my class is failing our clinical rotation this semester. At midterms, every group lost at least one person. I have to hand in my options for consolidation in 6 days, and I have nothing to put on the paper - I love working with people, but hated nearly every rotation except mental health. Med/Surg (where I am now) is like watching paint dry; no mental stimulation for me there. I have no idea where I'm going after school besides doing another 3 years of this to get my RN.   Then, in non-nursing world, everyone is going camping, on vacations, and generally enjoying life. People are sending me ""Are you dead?"" text messages, or ""What did you do this weekend?""   The stress, the never ending amount of homework, the crying jags, working night shifts, and 0630 starts for clinical better be worth it."
StudentNurse,3ce1m4,organicvegetable,4,Tue Jul 7 05:18:52 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you're feeling so down. My SO went through an accelerated program and I just could not help her in the way that she needed. I just couldn't understand. Now, it's my turn to go into the accelerated program and she's been great at giving me advice: make friends in my pre-reqs leading up to the program (which was really helpful), study and read ahead whenever possible, remember the difference I'll be able to make, and just vent as much as possible wherever possible.  The main reason I'm going into this is because I saw how amazing the nurses were to my grandmother and my brother-in-law. In my brother-in-law's case, he was in very good health and young (52), but had a mild heart attack at home; he was admitted into the hospital where the doctors told me he would be fine given he was in good health (non-smoker, athletic, etc.). I had to pick up my niece from school, still thinking that he would be okay when I got a text from my sister saying he passed away and not to come back yet. My sister was a wreck and would probably have traumatized my poor niece. After a while, I got a call from a nurse asking me to come with my niece so that she could break the news to her (there was also a social worker there and she had told me it was best if a child receives this type of news from someone outside the family since hearing it from her mother/my sister or me would associate us with her father's death). It was awful to see my poor niece's heart break and how much it hurt the nurse to see a little girl devastated. I got to spend some time with the nurse and saw how she recompose herself because my brother-in-law was not her only patient. She went from consoling my family, to giving more bad news to another family, to giving great news to another, and so on. She was making a difference. She was helping people, and me, even though we were just devastated; but she still made a difference to us. She broke the news to my niece, gave my sister great advice on what she had to do next (""you're now everything to your daughter. You're going to have to be strong for your daughter because she's going to have a piece of her missing just like you are""). It was just amazing and sad at the same time, that we were just one of many for her but she made us feel like we were her entire world in that moment.  It's an awe-inspiring thing to see a great nurse at work and it made me want to be as great as she is. I had to go back to my job (formerly, career) in finance after the bereavement time and where I once felt fulfilled, I began to feel empty. What I was doing just did not matter compared to what I witnessed. It was/is an easy job and paid so well, but I just felt nothing doing it.  So, that's why we're doing it. If it were easy, it wouldn't be worth doing. So, it's okay to feel alone, exhausted, tired, even empty sometimes. But remember why you're doing it. You're going to make a difference in somebody's life one day, and this is the price you have to pay right now for it."

That's not anyone's fault, just the nature of the situation.   But hang in there! Keep that excitement over your schoolwork and move forward. You are achieving an awesome accomplishment. You'll be okay. Don't give up.   You may not be attending BBQs (I'm not either, except for my fiance grilling hotdogs on July 4th, haha) but you have in mind a greater goal.   Keep on. Finish your schooling. It's for a purpose, really! Fight that apathy. You have the privilege of learning/knowing things that so many people don't.   P.S. You are NOT abnormal."

I've found that having one day to myself without any studying has kept me sane, whether it having drinks with friends or binge watching Netflix. Sometimes we need mental health days to recharge. Befriending just even one person in your program can hopefully help too! It's nice to talk to someone who understands the struggle :)  best of luck to you in your program!"

Spending all your time in the library is going to burn you out so fast that by the time you become a nurse, you'll have no motivation."

StudentNurse,3cd5je,Generoh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:40:45 2015 UTC,Transfer programs here in Canada anyway. I'm enrolled for a BScN through my college but they're actually teaching a long distance program for a university.
StudentNurse,3cd5je,chevymeister,0,Tue Jul 7 01:06:30 2015 UTC,Do you mean did they offer anything OTHER than bachelors? Most community colleges offer associates degrees only. The community college in my area offers bachelors only in very select fields - and even then it is split up into associates/bachelors. So you go for two years - get your associates - and then go for another two years and get your bachelors. They are two separate processes.
StudentNurse,3cd5je,Hashtaglibertarian,4,Tue Jul 7 00:47:27 2015 UTC,I had the impression that community colleges only offered associates but I guess it varies
StudentNurse,3cd5je,Generoh,2,Tue Jul 7 01:00:06 2015 UTC,"My school is one of those community colleges that offers a BSN. I pay $114 a credit hour for the first two years, and $300 a credit hour for the last year (which the GI Bill covers completely.)   In my state, the CC actually are considered the most desirable program due to 1) cheaper tuition 2) more clinical hours 3) direct transfer to BSN program. It's actually harder to get into the CCs as opposed to the four year university.   I'm in favor of anything that produces quality nursing students, while saving the students $$$. I'll take the reduced student ""life"" opportunities at my CC in exchange for a cheaper tuition that produces the same end result (BSN.)"
StudentNurse,3cd5je,starfish_mantra,2,Tue Jul 7 19:39:46 2015 UTC,"Same where I live in NE. The program I just got into is only around $60 a credit hour but has an excellent reputation so it's very difficult to get into, especially in the spring quarter in which they only have 30 seats. They don't, however, do a Bachelor's. I'll have to do an RN to BSN at a different school."
StudentNurse,3cd5je,Amymars,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:49:41 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, a lot of ADN programs incorporate the same classes as BSN classes. It's just usually a handful of the general education classes that are missing. I think a higher level of chemistry, fine arts, a junior comp class, a language class, and a worlds art class was all that I was missing from my BSN. The BSN repeated a lot of material that was covered in my ADN program."

StudentNurse,3cd5je,macavity_is_a_dog,2,Tue Jul 7 02:14:58 2015 UTC,Not at any school where I live. Students simply transfer to another school and do an RN to BSN in one year.
StudentNurse,3cd5je,womanwithoutborders,0,Tue Jul 7 20:50:29 2015 UTC,Which is exactly why that kind of program exists. I think it's great.

Having their own revenue source means that don't have to cater to popular opinion, and are less subject to bias.  The American Heart Association, and Association of Acute Care Nurse Practitioners are great sources for practice guidelines and recommendations  The Joint Commission website is a good resources for hospital standards and the ever growing list of National Patient Safety Goals  Medicare's Hospital Compare site will allow you to compare hospitals to their neighbors and against a national standard based on standardized measures. I will also plug this site as a sampler for employee morale at a prospective employer. If their scores are significantly lower that the neighboring hospitals, it's been by experience that the employees will be as dissatisfied as the patients are.  The New York Times and NPR health sections produces decent content on occasion, but are not as independent as other sources.  Science Based Medicine is a blog dedicated to dispelling pseudoscience and SCAM or ""complimentary alternative medicine"" For research, I like Google Scholar and PubMed.

StudentNurse,3c98p4,Danceswithchocobos,2,Thu Jul 9 05:06:20 2015 UTC,"If you're already enrolled in a college (for pre-reqs perhaps?) you should have access to their library database.   Try and search publications in the last 2 or so years and see if anything strikes your fancy. I'd also recommend heading over to r/science and see if they can help as well. If anything, they're pretty good at debunking a study (seeing if it's legit or not).   With that said, I had my interview a couple of weeks ago. Although I was waitlisted, I had an interviewer comment on how she thought my answers came from the heart. Rehearsing some answers may help to fill in the gaps, but just dig deep on how YOU would answer these questions and you should be fine. Good luck!"

StudentNurse,3c98p4,destroyingtocreate,2,Mon Jul 6 03:16:32 2015 UTC,"I think that kind of question might be more geared toward a job interview type question ... nevertheless ...   I would say that you read up on peer reviewed medical journals and evidenced based practice. (Google evidenced based practice and you'll have scholarly articles to pop up.. look around.)    You can mention American Nurses Association - go to their website, and at the top click the link for research and see what they have - you'll find stuff, I think you can look at articles and stuff on there. Check out other nursing organization websites like the AACN... etc."

Some that I am currently using: Best Practices (British Medical Journal), Epocrates, Medscape, This Week (New England Journal of Medicine).   Edit: Also, if the organization for your area of intended specialization publishes up-to-date clinical practice guidelines, definitely check those out!

StudentNurse,3c9772,SirLafayette,10,Mon Jul 6 01:55:07 2015 UTC,"The answer is A.   Rationale: A) Cirrhosis - patients with cirrhosis often have a low protein level due to malnourishment and should follow a diet high in protein as long as they are not edematous, have ascites, or are in a coma. (Normal serum protein in an adult patient is 6-8 g/dl.)  B) Paralytic Ileus - NPO/NGT to suction.   C) Cholelithiasis - need to follow gallbladder diet, which consists of low fat, low cholesterol, and high fiber.   D) Dumping Syndrome - these patients need to follow a diet that will prevent dumping syndrome: avoid milk, sugar, and salt.  Although, it is true they should eat a diet high in protein, high in fat, and low in carbs.   Edit: Correction on the NPO part."
StudentNurse,3c9772,destroyingtocreate,2,Mon Jul 6 05:05:10 2015 UTC,This exactly.
StudentNurse,3c9772,mayx2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:41:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree..  Patients with cirrhosis require reduced amounts of daily protein (20g~ a day) in order to prevent ammonia buildup and hepatic encephalopathy. High fat diet (whole milk) is also avoided due to the related cardiovascular risks and demand for bile. A high carbohydrate diet and high calorie diet is required (low carbohydrates in this diet) for tissue regeneration.  I believe that D is correct. It fits all the requirements that a patient with dumping syndrome needs, minus the liquid part. But milk shakes and whole milk is somewhat thicker than regular fluids. Additionally, they can position themselves supine on their left side after eating to reduce rapid emptying.  In the end, you would do a lot less harm giving a diet like this to a patient with dumping syndrome rather than cirrhosis, and that's exactly what the NCLEX creators want to see - least amount of harm  Just my 2 cents."

Everything that I've seen in my books and what I was taught in school says that stable cirrhosis patients should be given a normal protein diet - with protein levels being closely monitored.  I don't want to pull out my books, but here are some sources that I found on the topic of protein restriction:  Article 1  Article 2"

If ascites and edema are absent and the client does not exhibit signs of impending coma, a high-protein diet supplemented with vitamins is prescribed.  3. Provide supplemental vitamins (B complex, vitamins A, C, and K, folic acid, and thiamine) as prescribed.  Source: Saunders Comprehensive 6th Ed. Ch. 56, pg. 694  Dumping Syndrome Prevention  Avoid sugar, salt, and milk.  Eat a high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet.  Eat small meals and avoid consuming fluids with meals.

StudentNurse,3c9772,destroyingtocreate,2,Mon Jul 6 22:01:44 2015 UTC,"But no where in the question does it state that the client is tolerant of protein and/or lacking complications (ascites, impending coma). For the NCLEX, you must always assume the worst. You do not have further information to take a risk and provide them with this diet.  Based on the information provided, a client with dumping syndrome will receive the least amount of harm from this diet."
StudentNurse,3c9772,Yallah_Habibi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:59:50 2015 UTC,"I understand your point...  and frankly I think this is a shitty question - you wont see this kind of stuff on nclex (at least in my personal experience - everything was very precise - unlike this question where you're guessing about the status of the cirrhosis patient type of thing..)  But even still, I'm going to stick to my answer.. there's no reason to add extra information whether positive (patient can receive protein) or negative (patient is in a coma and can't receive protein... fuck it, we'll take our chances and see how the milk and fluids go over with our dumping syndrome pt. maybe they'll start having palpitations and tachycardia .. see what I mean?)"

StudentNurse,3c9772,girl_giant,2,Tue Jul 7 13:22:03 2015 UTC,Maybe A because of reduced colloidal pressure due to reduced protein production of the liver. Increasing protein would help with ascites and other forms of cirrhosis related edema.
StudentNurse,3c9772,LabRatsAteMyHomework,2,Mon Jul 6 03:19:34 2015 UTC,I'm between A and D but leaning towards A as a default because you don't want to give someone with dumping syndrome liquids meals. What answer did you pick.
StudentNurse,3c9772,TheOneKnownAsMonk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:08:40 2015 UTC,I would say D?  edit: to explain my answer A would not need the extra protein added. B would be NPO. C has a problem with fat absorption so although the whole milk would work there is no need for supplemental protein. D needs lots of calories and nutrition but with avoidance of foods high in sugar which can exacerbate the issues. Therefore I chose D

StudentNurse,3c89zg,JessicaHarper,5,Sun Jul 5 20:55:05 2015 UTC,"I got a Galaxy Note 8"", came with an active stylus (has a button and functions) and Polaris Office (MS office clone) included. It has a kickass handwriting recognition program, and it's own usefull office suite type thing SNote. I added to that a microSD card for expanded memory and super easy file transfers, and a cheap bluetooth keyboard. I loved it, took all my notes on it, and it was within my price range. Being Android was a plus for me since I didn't have anything else in the Apple ""ecosystem."" I have seen Dell Venue Pro and Microsoft Surface tablets used to good effect, depending on your price point. A few students in my program did attempt Ipads but those I talked to stopped using it, and went back to paper and pen. The one thing I might do different would be to get the 10"" instead of the 8"", weight and size would be an acceptable trade off for more screen, but my college budget was just fine with the 8"", I wouldn't go much smaller though.   As far as staying ahead, or falling less behind than others:    Pay attention during physiology and pathophysiology, understanding the body systems will make it so much easier to learn about what happens when shit goes wrong. It is like understanding the rules of chess rather than memorizing every single gamut/attack/defense whatever. Once you know how the individual pieces of the system are supposed to interact, you can think out the natural consequences of something misbehaving much easier than if you were trying to memorize the disorder all on its own. Get an NCLEX review book now, not to prep for the NCLEX but to help you pass classes. This is the one I got after I graduated, and then spent the next few days wishing I had it at the beginning. Excellent summaries and quick info about everything, all broken out into units that I could have followed along with during school. Even an older version bought cheap would be fine. Also get a nursing medication reference book (not a ""textbook""). It will probably be on your ""suggested"" book list or even required, but get the physical book. Your patients are likely to a lot of meds, and your instructors may make you look up all 45 (my record). Highlight and sticky tab the crap out it. Nursing drug books usually have a ""Nursing Considerations"" section and ""Patient Education"" section for each drug, which was exactly what I needed. Epocrates was great for a quick single look up, but it doesn't have prioritization, or as much detail, plus you can't highlight or tab it.  When you start doing whatever your school has you doing for medications, begin building a database of meds, tailored specifically to what they want and how they want it. That way when you see it again you can copy/paste. There is no need to fill look up tylenol, ibuprofen, morphine, dulcox, reglan, and the host of other routine, see them every freaking time, meds. On the subject of books, they are going to cost a ton of money, and unless you are a really visual learner they may not actually help you learn anything. Where they were most valuable to me was a references for careplans (which you will learn about), and papers. If they come wrapped in plastic, do not unwrap them until at least 3-4 classes into that particular subject. Unwrapped books cannot be returned for full price, and frequently I didn't use them. If you can, rent the book from amazon, or wherever, it will save you money, and then you don't have to try and sell it back at the end of the semester. Labor and delivery, pediatrics, pharmacology, EKGs, psych, some I bought others I rented, none I touched or needed after that class. Your med/surg, patho, and careplan books are your gold references generally. Get comfortable with APA reference style, if you aren't already, OWL, was my usual source for formatting. Be ready to accept that each professor may have a different understanding of it, don't argue just adjust, even if you have two professors telling you to do opposite things. Get used to the idea that some people's education will be easier than yours, and recognize that some people's will be harder. Their patients may be nicer and easier to handle, or not. It felt like I always wound up with the contact precaution patients. Individual professors and instructors will set different standards. Some are easy and you learn nothing, some are easy and you learn loads, some are hard and you learn nothing, some are hard and you learn loads, and which one you get may be luck of the draw. Don't be afraid to speak up if you don't understand something, a lot of this material is incredibly complex and some professors... well suck at teaching. Put your hand up, and let them know they need to go back over the material.  Your instructors may or may not write the test, so it may or may not matter what it says in the book. Find out which it is in each class, and study appropriately. When you find a contradiction, point it out in a way that is asking for clarification, they may have simply misspoken.  Remember that you are building a toolkit. Every skill you acquire is one more thing you can whip out to fix a problem, practice them, and don't be afraid to mess up, the nurses on the floor, and your instructor have your back and won't let you do anything to bad. Be active in wanting to learn/do/see things in the clinical environment. Ask for special rotations you might like, such as a visit to the wound clinic, infusion center, etc. Either extern somewhere or work part time a CNA/tech/volunteer. Just being in the hospital environment will make you look more attractive to employers, and help you learn to talk to patients, handle the work load, and relax in the job later."
StudentNurse,3c89zg,sofewusernamesleft,2,Sun Jul 5 23:43:42 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of good information here but remember that your instructors are the ones that will grade you. If they tell you to do something APA and it isn't like the Perdue Owl says it should be (or even the APA'd own website) it is still their class and your grade. Don't get hung up on it just make the corrections and turn it in again.   For the tablet thing. I would recommend a spiral notebook and pen. It is much harder to get distracted by Facebook, reddit, imgur, text, imessage, ETC. And when you go home to type up your notes it is a good review of your days lectures."

I keep them on a bookshelf and they will probably always have sentimental value to me. That being said - try to also get ebook versions, cause carrying books to class will break your back, unless you've got a roller backpack.   I didn't/don't have a tablet, I just used my macbook air.. which worked well. So I can't suggest anything as far as tablets.

They send all the critical cases out.  Trauma centers are going to require a BSN. Community centers, probably not, but again, depends on where you are.  I personally went to a community college for 2 years and passed the NCLEX, and then I transferred into a top-ranked BSN program which I will finish in about 10 months. Finances were a big thing for me, so that was the cheapest way to go about it. I found most of the BSN courses required more pre-reqs, so I worked on that during my summers between the ASN program.  As a recent grad, I dont have too much to offer in terms of noteworthy advice. But I have to say, this is my second career, and I LOVE it. Best life decision I ever made was going back to school to become a nurse."

The prereqs required will take you quite a while as it is, before you even get into a program. You will most likely need to take around 8-9 classes if you don't have prior schooling. The program might only require 6 prerequisites or something like that, but some of those prerequisites have prerequisites themselves. It is a tedious process.  As far as GI Bill goes, don't use it off the bat if you can help it. Most programs are going to be at least two years, and you are going to most likely have at least 1.5 years of schooling before that. So being that we only have 36 months plan accordingly.

I feel like that would be the best way to go about it, but I wouldn't say it's like a combat environment. I'd say you're looking for a trauma one. Trauma is high stress and there's all kinds of people running around when an alert comes in. we do have the helipad. Lots of gunshots and car accidents, a lot of unresponsive patients. but that may also depend on the area you're working in. our hospital is in a very urban area, low SES, etc...we take EVERYBODY. which is another point, not all hospitals are the same. so I suggest: 1. Shadow a trauma one center if possible 2. Shadow around the ED 3. Shadow a nurse on a completely different floor, see what the bedside is like there.  Nursing is a great degree, and you can do plenty of other things besides bedside and actively taking care of patients. A lot of nurses start working in administration, you can do Infection Control...there are lots of possibilities within the healthcare setting, but everybody has to pay their dues!"

StudentNurse,3bwp4n,macavity_is_a_dog,2,Thu Jul 9 10:37:01 2015 UTC,"Ok, back with my Q's:    Did you work in healthcare before applying to nursing school? During you work during nursing school? Did you do lots of health care related volunteering before nursing school? Was it hard getting the loan? What sort of requirements did it take? Do you have to pay back the loan when you get the job or right after the school ended? How did you prepare for nursing school? What tools did you use to study? What was your weakest and strongest subject? What work schedule worked best for you while in school? The school I'm looking at strongly suggests not working during the school year. But I would like to have a part-time hospital job while I'm there and not over-burden myself. Did you have any doubts during the school year? Like, questioning if you'll make it or discouraged by the workload? Did you choose which field of Nursing you wanted to enter?  How difficult were your clinicals? Would you say the students who were already working in healthcare had a better chance of landing a nursing job at the hospital they worked at? (that's my plan hopefully). I'm still working on my prerequistes, what do you suggest I do now to prepare myself for nursing school (starts next summer), what should I be reading or practicing now?   Ok that's all I can think of! Thanks for answering :)"
StudentNurse,3bwp4n,bikesboozeandbacon,2,Fri Jul 3 14:50:18 2015 UTC,"I got a BS in health science. Always knew I wanted to do something in healthcare but wasn't sure what. My soph year of college a friend introduced me to what nursing was really like (she was in an absn too). Jobs I had in college were mostly relevant- two jobs as office staff in medical office and one job at my college as a research assistant for a professor in my department. Lots of people in my program didn't have any experience but had maybe shadowed a nurse/ volunteered a little.  Definitely work during school. Find a flexible job like restaurant or urgent care. School will go on and on about how you shouldn't work but some people were even nurse externs. You will have enough time/ have a life. People also never told me there would be some time between finals/graduation/ licensing and it would have helped if I had a job (can't study all that time! You will go crazy). So I used care.com for dog walking but I regret not being a nurse's aid or doing restaurant work where I could have made some money.  Volunteered at a hospital for a month and hated it because the hospital didn't use volunteers well. I mostly took out the trash. If you want to volunteer, look for good programs that are reputable that use their volunteers (maybe teaching hospitals).  ABSN is seen as a 5th year of undergrad so you get undergrad loans. I am 23 so I had to put my parent's name on the FAFSA and they make a decent amount of money so I did not get 'aid'. I got one stafford loan that was 5k that everyone got. Also got a scholarship for 2k which mostly everyone in my program got. Then my parents took out the parent plus loan in the remaining cost. You might have different circumstances. I also lived in the city near school while other people commuted from home so that added to the cost.  There is a 6 mo grace period for the gov loans I took out so I am still waiting for that to kick in.  I came right out of undergrad so I did not prepare. Two days after my graduation I went to my program. I just studied powerpoints and always, always did nclex questions prior to the tests. I used google and the Saunders NCLEX book (the yellow one) for questions to get a basic idea of what I understood/needed to work on. I never really read the textbooks. Strongest: anything adult/ I did well in critical care when a lot of people were not doing well. Weakest- ob/peds were rough for me but I did fine. Just not my strong points. Only 1 ob question on the nclex lucky me (but I knew it was my weak point so I spent a lot of time studying that) Don't listen to the school. They all say this. Maybe you can do one semester and see how it goes then start working. Also, this will give you time to get one clinical under your belt. Lots of hospitals will hire nurse aids that are nursing students after they have proof of one clinical rotation.  I never had doubts. I knew this was what I wanted from undergrad and I loved every minute of it, even if the workload sucked at times. This was what I was meant to do and what I am passionate about. One of my classmates had doubts 1st semester. Our clinical together was on a very messy floor (lots of poop). She pondered dropping out because she said ""it doesn't seem like I'm actually helping anyone, I'm just cleaning"". I sat next to her at graduation and I asked what her thoughts were now. She said she knows she made a smart decision and she will use her degree but she is not sure how. I think she ended up liking mother baby and maybe ER so she will do great things I am sure.  I wanted an ICU and was determined to get into an ICU. I networked like crazy and people in my class actually came to me asking for job advice in the end of the year. Last week I accepted a position in an ICU and I wake up everyday feeling like the luckiest person ever. Any questions about networking and all that just message me because that is a whole other topic. Not everyone gets to pick their specialty right out of school so backups are always great. But don't give up! Some clinicals were tougher than others. My community rotation was at a school which was more laid back and good hours. One of my toughest rotations was in a surgical step down with a clinical instructor that was an ICU charge nurse. Lots of stress but I cannot thank her enough for all she taught me. Ask your instructors what is expected of you and they will tell you. Some of mine (a quick neuro rotation that was 4 days long and my maternity rotation in L and D) were more watching and doing basic vitals. All depends on expectations.  All depends on your area. I know a few people who externed on one floor and the floor told them they only had 1 ft position available at the end of school. There were 5 externs fighting for that position, working all hours they could to show they were the best. Maybe some of them will get hired into the hospital still but it is still early on (a lot of people just getting RN now). Using clinical instructors to help was another strategy I heard of people using to get jobs in the field they wanted. I was passed over in a phenomenal ICU because I did not have any tech experience-- a friend of a friend passed my resume to their manager and wrote some really kind words saying that I would be good for the position. Since I did not have aid/extern ICU experience they would not hire me. Totally not uncommon. If you are set on ICU definitely try to get into an ICU as an aid or extern!!  They will teach you all you need to know. It is good you are thinking ahead of everything but just relax and do prereqs now. Once school starts, definitely get that yellow Saunders NCLEX book to review before tests. Anything else just let me know. I know this was long!!"
StudentNurse,3bwp4n,Socrateswasacowboy,2,Fri Jul 3 16:23:10 2015 UTC,"Also!! You will have a life. I ran 2 half marathons, worked out 6 days a week and didn't succumb to a life of eating junk food. Never pulled an all-nighter. You can do it!!"

StudentNurse,3bwcmx,throwawayokcool987,4,Thu Jul 2 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"You're probably going to get a variety of different answers because it really depends on the individual college as to what their specific requirements are for acceptance into their nursing program.   One thing is almost certain, however - you will have to have Anatomy, Physiology, Microbiology, and Chemistry (aka: ""The Big 4."")   My (community) college required several other classes as well: English, Algebra, General Psychology, Life Span Psychology, Speech (some call it Oral Communication), Sociology or Anthropology, some kind of humanities elective, a social AND behavioral science elective, and P.E. course.   Some colleges accept by GPA... my school accepted by ""lottery method.""  Which, I think is great because it gives the people who are intelligent but not 4.0 students a chance.  Once you had taken the required classes and the TEAS exam and met the minimum GPA and minimum score for the TEAS exam, your name got thrown into a pile and was chosen randomly.   Personally I would be applying to wherever you can 1) afford, 2) fit the requirements for acceptance ... some people may feel differently but nursing is largely self taught. Maybe not so much the clinical portion, but the theory portion for sure.    I didn't have a resume when I started nursing school - lol. And no one ever asked for one. I didn't have to do an interview for a place in my program. But, sometimes that is the case, and if you have to do that - just be excited and passionate, ready to learn.. that's what they want in a student.    Hope that is somewhat helpful...  Edit: Punctuation."
StudentNurse,3bwcmx,destroyingtocreate,2,Thu Jul 2 18:43:33 2015 UTC,"Upvoting this!  Pick a college you can afford and will not leave you broke when you graduate. Some schools will require your CNA, some just want you to take CNA classes.   It can be hard to work and go to nursing school, esp when you start clinicals because you can't give your employer a schedule with lots of notice.  Keep that in mind when you pick a school.  After getting my BA from a liberal arts school, i went to community college 15 years later for my ASN.  My CC has an ASN to BSN program through that same school- at CC tuition rates.   It will take me less time to go through community college to get my BSN and cost me less.  (And allow me to work as an RN during the ASN to BSN transition.)"

StudentNurse,3bwcmx,macavity_is_a_dog,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:20:19 2015 UTC,"Your grades soudn pretty good. Some schools are more competitive than others, so definitely apply to a bunch. One thing to also look at is where schools send people for clinical rotations. It is ideal to be put in big city teaching hospitals because you will see a large range of cases while you are there. Another idea for the CNA is to get into nursing school and wait until you complete one clinical rotation. A lot of places, including hospitals, will hire you after you have finished one clinical rotation as a nurse's aid."
StudentNurse,3bwcmx,12345hey,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:48:51 2015 UTC,"CNA classes at my comm college went all semester long going twice a week, or half a semester going for more of an accelerated schedule, but that probably varies school to school. I found getting certified and working as a CNA very beneficial, just for feeling very comfortable in the patient care setting and getting some healthcare experience (and some clinical instructors have given a little more independence/trust by default, but that varies).  Neither of the schools I applied to factored that in with admissions, but others certainly do.  I would pick some schools that you are interested in, contact advisors and ask about the most recent acceptance statistics, google around to see if you can find people accepted/not accepted to schools to get a general idea of what they've done in the past, but it can change year to year so wouldn't take what you find as gospel.    If you are at comm college right now, look into phi theta kappa scholarships being offered at any schools you are interested in transferring to. I debated between a public and private school, and the transfer scholarship + phi theta kappa scholarship put the private school fairly close.  I chose the public school anyway, which was really competitive and pretty much based solely on GPA. A few people who had decent but lower GPAs got into the school first as a non-nursing major and then applied, as nursing admissions were  more forgiving about GPA if you are applying from within the university. Again that loophole may not apply everywhere, but worth exploring if you are interested but concerned about meeting requirements.   Personally I would base my decision mostly on cost, and then how accessible classes and clinical sites are. You have a good GPA, I'm sure you have some great choices if you look around! Good luck!"
StudentNurse,3bwcmx,Fauxliage,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:39:49 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends.  I live in SoCal and applied to only one school and got in, but I've also heard that a lot of people are having a really hard time getting in right now so it's hard to say what your experience is going to be.    When I applied I already had a previous bachelors with a 3.85 GPA.  My school never really asked about my previous work experience - they only wanted to know if we had any previous schooling and if we were licensed LVN's.    I think you just need to do a lot of research into the schools that you want to apply to and see what they require.  Some schools require different things, like the TEAS and great GPA's, while others require other things."
StudentNurse,3bvn3x,Danceswithchocobos,3,Thu Jul 2 14:58:41 2015 UTC,"Because some classes may need to be taken before nursing school while in other programs, it it taught during nursing school. For example, some of the programs need nutrition as a pre-req while some nursing schools incorporate nutrition into their curriculum.  Also, some school stand alone as a nursing school while larger institutions are further divided into smaller schools, so their ""nutrition"" may be catered to the major."
StudentNurse,3bvn3x,Generoh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:42:54 2015 UTC,I think it's exactly what Generoh said.  I had this problem too when I was applying out west versus in mid eastern area of Canada. Super frustrating...I ended up deciding to take a year at community college to open up my options by taking some courses (math and chemistry).  Some schools have a pre-nursing one year program to get all your pre-reqs too. A lot of my friends who got wait listed applied for that and got into nursing the following year.  I would also get in contact with registrars directly cuz sometimes if you send them the syllabus and name of the school/class that you think is close to the prereq you need they may be able to tell you if it'll work...maybe not ..but you never know?
StudentNurse,3bvn3x,msega1988,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:07:03 2015 UTC,The schools I applied to had the same pre reqs. They just might have different names for the class depending on the institution.

I'm applying to accelerated BSN programs and I'm finding a lot of schools in different regions have all these extra pre-reqs. I can't apply to any schools in Texas, because they all require several extra classes beyond the normal ones (A&P, chem, microbio, etc) ..like ""texas government history"" ..well I live in NJ and I can tell you that my school does not offer a class on the history of texan government! Its frustrating because it takes a lot of schools off my list. I don't have the time or money to take these bullshit classes. A lot of southern schools in general from what Ive noticed want a bunch of government classes..And frankly I think it's a nice idea, shows you are well rounded, but shit I've taken enough classes that aren't directly related to nursing and don't have the time or money to keep taking irrelevant classes! I mean, I totally understand that being a class you'd need to take to graduate if you were in a regular undergrad BSN program, like a core requirement or something, but I don't see how this is relevant to a second degree program"
StudentNurse,3bwcec,Starvenn,4,Thu Jul 2 18:11:52 2015 UTC,"I personally think it looks good to have critical care preceptorship experience when you apply for a job, such as ICU or ER.   If you choose ICU, when creating your resume, you can list that you had X amount of residency/preceptorship hours in the ICU as a student nurse which allowed you to work with critically ill patients that required a higher level of care. You can list some skills that may set you apart from those who had med-surg.. such as: working in fast-paced environments, using ACLS protocol, working with certain types of equipment, caring for patients with specific types of diagnoses that had undergone specific surgeries/procedures..  It may set you apart from other applicants and give you an advantage."
StudentNurse,3bwcec,destroyingtocreate,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:52:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for you advice but I'm personally not that strong of a student so I'm not sure if ICU would be for me.

StudentNurse,3bwcec,destroyingtocreate,6,Thu Jul 2 20:12:16 2015 UTC,"What better time to learn and grow than when you are a student! Hopefully you will have a great preceptor/mentor to teach you the ropes, and someone you feel comfortable with to ask questions .. if you perform well and your preceptor likes you, they can also be someone you can ask for a letter of recommendation.

StudentNurse,3bv8z9,B_Hutt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:51:41 2015 UTC,"All of that is relevant work experience.  Use your cover letter to explain your decision to move into patient care.  It is all ways better to show some work history even if you think it is not relevant.    When you finally make a resume as a new nursing grad keep some of the past history and add a section that details your clinical experiences.  I made a section on my resume for it and filled it in as I went through my program.  As a new grad they know you come with a limited experience.  Past jobs can be used to show other qualities like dependability, leadership, etc."

I went to the career counseling services that were available for free at my university.  Utilize these if you have access to them.  One important thing that she taught me was to show how your past employment makes you a viable candidate.  So under that work history, do not just simply list tasks in 1-2 bullet points.  Did the job help you to improve your communication?  Was it related to customer service (almost all of nursing is)?  Did you have any leadership opportunities in these jobs?  So my bullet points under my employment section look like this:     ""Listened and effectively communicated with... blah blah blah (whatever is relevant to your work responsibilities).""  ""Utilized strong communication and problem solving skills to...""  ""Applied organizational skills to...""  You can do this with any sort of organizational/time management/prioritization/communication/leadership skills that you gained through those jobs.     You get the idea.  All of these qualities are important in nursing.  All of the jobs that you have had have assisted you in becoming a better nurse in some way.  The important part is, how are you going to convey that?     With my help from career services, I got a callback on almost every application that I submitted and had a job lined up before I even graduated this May.

Not only can it cause tension when things go sour between you and the SO, it will alienate your coworkers and many will assume that any accolades received are ill-deserved.   I have made these mistakes myself and I learned the very hard way. My ex-wife wasn't even in my actual unit (she was in a different company in my battalion) but because I was a Staff Sergeant and she wasn't, people assumed that I was going behind the scenes to get her promoted or get favorable details (duty assignments). Even though both her and I made very conscious efforts to not see each other at work, on the rare occasion that we did (FRG, award ceremonies, etc.) it still caused problems among not only my peers, but my subordinates and superiors alike.

They all say they understand, but they don't. I've had many dates with people in other fields and it never went far because of it.   In my years of dating (god that sounds pathetic) I've had the best connections with cops, firefighters, other paramedics, and military personnel.

My study plan was study/read in saunders first, once I finish a section I watched the corresponding video and made notes.

Even if at the end of those 12 weeks they say I'm ready and release me - what if I don't feel like I am, and I have to ask for a lot of help from other nurses?   That is what scares me...

StudentNurse,3bgk9u,hotspots_thanks,3,Mon Jun 29 01:27:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you work in a hospital or a hospital type environment in a red cross type of location this will eventually happen.   Best advice is to try to volunteer at a hospital with patients, apart from clinicals to try to get over it. If you get experience around actual patients you will realize if it's the type of environment you can handle or you should look into other options.  I say this because majority of the time, from what I've seen patients recover and when their discharge day comes, they begin to smile. However you have to accept you can't save everyone, and not every patient gets to return home.  Volunteering in the oncology/cardiology units once or twice a month really opens your eyes to that fact. Might help you get over the fears.  Most patients leave after a week or two, but there will always be that patient you couldn't save. Chances are it won't be your fault, and in the medical field death is something you want to avoid, but when it comes, you have to accept."

I've heard all the shit in the book about how I should have just gone for medicine, or how I'd make a great doctor etc over my years of study, and so far I've tolerated it all right. But people can be real jerks. I've worked retail for many years and met my share of jerks, and nursing at it's core is a form of customer service, just one that requires a very diverse skillset and large knowledge base. There are a small group of folks who have almost no regard for people serving them, and I fear one of these days I'll inevitably run into one of them again."

StudentNurse,3bdi3u,lovelyone20,2,Sun Jun 28 04:58:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your post. I am 6 months away from graduating and I've been slacking, just getting by with 75% in classes. We use ATI and hearing your story gives me hope that I'll be alright =)"
StudentNurse,3bdi3u,kleany,2,Sun Jun 28 06:13:09 2015 UTC,"Just make sure you can finish as strong as you possibly can! Our instructors were telling us that our final exam grades were good predictors of our chance of passing NCLEX, and I had barely gotten a 74, and that was WITH studying after I got my act together! But really, it's so much 'easier' to study once school was over (for me). Even while working I was much more productive and super motivated. Good luck to you! :)"
StudentNurse,3bdi3u,shayshay33,2,Sun Jun 28 13:48:10 2015 UTC,"I did a pretty descent job in my program. Never borderline passing, but not quite top of the class. B-range throughout and I scored mid 50-60s on the Kaplan stuff. I took the test on Friday. 265 questions later, I am freaking the fuck out. I feel totally defeated. Im guessing I will find out tomorrow on my BoN website.   Congrats on your result. I hope I can feel the way you do soon!"
StudentNurse,3bdi3u,YordlePoro,2,Mon Jun 29 01:08:32 2015 UTC,One of my classmates had consistently good grades in class and ended up with all of the questions too. But now he's a murse and scored an awesome job! I really haven't met anyone yet who felt like they passed the NCLEX with flying colors coming out! Good luck to you.
StudentNurse,3bdi3u,msega1988,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:40:24 2015 UTC,I start school in September and this is my biggest fear!   Reading your post has given me hope even if you aren't in the top of your class you can STILL achieve your dream! Cs get degrees :D

StudentNurse,3bdi3u,olov244,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:07:55 2015 UTC,Great job!! My nursing program has a min. 80% average and I failed one class by 3% so I was kicked out of the program but successfully appealed....if I fail another class im done- I hope to get where you are!!
StudentNurse,3bdi3u,olov244,-1,Fri Jul 10 00:35:01 2015 UTC,"I got kicked out of my program for two c's(even though some of my classmates were borderline dangerous with meds and skills they were booksmart and got a's). Now i have to try and transfer to finish up, this gives me hope."
StudentNurse,3bdi3u,olov244,5,Sun Jun 28 14:23:19 2015 UTC,"My advisor had, at one point, recommended me to withdraw and reapply the next year. That same day we had an exam and I got 90% on it (GI was always my forte lol), so I decided to stick it out. Some of my classmates are SO knowledgable, but I've witness some who have horrible bedside manner. If you really are going into this profession for the right reasons, I think that should motivate you enough at this point to study. Good luck with the transfer! Clean slate so start strong :)"
StudentNurse,3bdi3u,annastar,2,Sun Jun 28 18:37:18 2015 UTC,"yeah, hopefully I'll get another shot, I know the information, just get tripped up with some of the wording of NCLEX style questions, or I pick the second best answer(I also think one of my teachers just wrote horrible questions that were hard to understand). I got good grades with two teachers, and the third I was borderline failing on every test"
StudentNurse,3bc8c9,MissJRoses,7,Sat Jun 27 21:02:28 2015 UTC,I just found out I passed in 76 questions today. When the screen went blue I was certain I had failed. I was so surprised when I saw the that I had passed. My friend tried the trick and it worked for her. I believe in the trick I was just to scared to try.
StudentNurse,3bc8c9,kinjaninja,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:20:49 2015 UTC,congrats!!!
StudentNurse,3bc8c9,CameronandHobbes,5,Mon Jun 29 02:47:20 2015 UTC,I had like 85 questions and passed! Don't stress
StudentNurse,3bc8c9,brownsn1,3,Sat Jun 27 23:06:21 2015 UTC,"I had 96 questions and passed. A person in class had all 266 questions and passed.     I honestly believe that the test is designed to make you believe you failed. So my advice is... Take a deep breath, let it all out and wait the 48 hours that it takes to get the unofficial results (if your state allows)."
StudentNurse,3bc8c9,Plkjhgfdsa,2,Sun Jun 28 04:12:39 2015 UTC,"Try the Pearson trick!! You can use a card that doesn't have 200$ (prepaid Visa card) and it will still be accurate but won't be able to charge the card the next day. OR! Use one and pay for your next test tonight....none of that matters, though, because you'll get the good pop up! :) :)"
StudentNurse,3bc8c9,msega1988,2,Sun Jun 28 02:16:32 2015 UTC,I didn't do the trick because I was freaked out that it wouldnt be accurate..so I waited till I had that paper copy (which took about a week). I suggest just keeping busy!! When I finished it was like oh ya...I don't have to be a hermit...whaaaaa? I can hang out with those friends I've been ditching for the last three weeks...huh!! Best of luck!!
StudentNurse,3bc8c9,SpicyDubu,2,Sun Jun 28 02:45:38 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I took my exam this past Thursday and mine shut off at 75 and I was wishing so hard that I could have at least 20 more questions! Many of my friends told me that if I was doing poorly, then I would have had many more questions to answer because the NCLEX tries to 'help' you pass by making sure you are competent enough to be a nurse by continuous assessments after each question answered. I swear the whole test was a blur and I was so sure I hadn't passed. But I did the PVT and a few days later found out that I passed!"
StudentNurse,3bc8c9,chillicolada,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:29:54 2015 UTC,I am still waiting to get quick results or see anything on my BON...the whole test is a blur still!
StudentNurse,3bc8c9,raspberry_blue_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:49:28 2015 UTC,"If you took the NCLEX on Friday, like me, then you should be able to pay Pearson like $8 to get your results. I feel like that test is designed to make you feel terrible, I did 231 questions and I was absolutely convinced I failed. I was too scared to try the Pearson trick, so I waited and a friend told me that the quick results were up, and I found out I passed. I hope you get good news too! Good luck to you!"
StudentNurse,3bc8c9,raspberry_blue_,-2,Mon Jun 29 03:58:42 2015 UTC,"DO NOT DO THE PEARSON ""TRICK""! It is not accurate. What's the point of wasting $200 when you actually passed and it makes you freak out for 2 days? I know 2 days is a long time when it comes to this but it'll be here soon!  Also, 78 questions is a fine place to stop at. Think of this, about 90% of USA educated, first time takers pass the NCLEX. You have a great shot! Now relax and do something fun! Because that's all you can do :)"
StudentNurse,3bc8c9,carson3456,6,Sat Jun 27 21:45:57 2015 UTC,"The pearson trick is accurate. To protect you from wasting $200, go to walgreens and buy a prepaid visa for $20. Use that number. If it tries to charge the card and says you card was declined, you failed. If it says ""Our records indicate you recently scheduled an exam and you are unable to register at this time"" then you passed."
StudentNurse,3bc8c9,raspberry_blue_,2,Sat Jun 27 22:22:34 2015 UTC,I have heard of many many people who say it took their 200 when they have in fact passed
StudentNurse,3bc8c9,carson3456,2,Sat Jun 27 22:38:57 2015 UTC,"It worked for everyone in the class ahead of me that tried it (~25). In my class, 6 of us tried it, 5 got the good message (and found out we passed 48 hours later), and the 1 person who got charged found out she had failed."

The first two links you sent (which link to the same thread) are of a user doing the PVT before the site changed in Aug 2014. I no longer find that relevant. The second link does not provide enough details to know this was not a user error.   To avoid the supposed risk of paying $200 in error, I have read many reports of people simply using a different expiration date with their correct card number. Or a prepaid gift card without the money on it."

StudentNurse,3bc8c9,frou_frou_frou,2,Sun Jun 28 04:40:18 2015 UTC,Wife of this redditor who just took the NCLEX and is freaking out here: Not trying to get in the middle of an argument or anything but I just graduated from nursing school and one of my very competent classmates did the trick and according to the trick it showed that she had failed when in fact she found out later she had passed. I'm just waiting to get the quick results from them rather than trying any trick.
StudentNurse,3bc8c9,yodudeits,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:12:26 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere on here that if you change the expiration date of your card, the trick will still work. I got the good notification and a few days later I knew officially that I had passed!"

StudentNurse,3bcdb5,azbartender,2,Sun Jun 28 01:19:13 2015 UTC,How'd it go?  Mine is the 21st...
StudentNurse,3bcdb5,azbartender,2,Sun Jun 28 17:13:37 2015 UTC,It was hard. I felt like I only knew a little bit. I guess this is what everyone says. I got a good amount of SATA but they were all like in the first half. I had 75 questions and I actually wanted more so I could tell I was actually still in the game. Just have to wait now. I hope what they say about having good Kaplan scores is true! If you took Kaplan it looks exactly the same with larger text.
StudentNurse,3bcdb5,azbartender,3,Sun Jun 28 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"I've been doing the Qbank, averaging between 60-70...  So similar to the Kaplan questions?  or just the layout?"
StudentNurse,3bcdb5,azbartender,2,Sun Jun 28 17:32:46 2015 UTC,"I'd say Kaplan was similar. I think I just felt more of a ""wow what is this?"" because it was the NCLEX rather than just Kaplan. I didn't get anxious though. My heart was beating for like the first 3 questions and then I was cool. It kind of feels like a blur. Like I had all easy questions that I got wrong, but it's hard to tell what's higher level and what's lower level. My second to last was a SATA so I hope that's good. The last one I just hope was above passing. Waiting sucks but I am not looking forward to see the result actually, if that makes sense. It's scary because failing is a real possibility and it would suck to fail at 75."
StudentNurse,3bcdb5,Derparita,2,Sun Jun 28 17:40:22 2015 UTC,I'm sure you didn't fail...

StudentNurse,3bcdb5,SpicyDubu,2,Sun Jun 28 01:17:51 2015 UTC,What grades were you getting on your Kaplan question trainers and Qbanks? I'm scheduled to take the test mid July and it would be nice to try and make a connection between scores and how it turns out for you. Good luck!
StudentNurse,3bcdb5,FearAndLoafing,3,Sun Jun 28 00:21:50 2015 UTC,Diagnostic - 66% Readiness - 68% Qtranier 1 - 63% Qtrainer 2 - 60% Qtrainer 3 - 59% Qtranier 4 - 63% Qtrainer 5 - 67% Qtrainer 6 - 61% Qtrainer 7 - 62% Qbank overall - 62%   My numbers got a little better because I started eating breakfast! haha always eat breakfast!

StudentNurse,3bbd2b,Ribenadrinker,3,Sat Jun 27 16:23:58 2015 UTC,"I would say right before graduation, everything but narcotics, blood transfusions and things like IABP/BP titration. That's US though"
StudentNurse,3bbd2b,A_Dwayne,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:44:04 2015 UTC,Good reply. I think that too. Knowing how to set up a bedspace for an admission is year 1 stuff right?
StudentNurse,3bbd2b,A_Dwayne,2,Sat Jun 27 16:48:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would say so, but that's not something usually taught in school though beyond having ambubag/ET tube type things depending on patient condition. I had to learn that through experience."
StudentNurse,3bbd2b,Squid-bear,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:51:22 2015 UTC,"Didn't you have placements in hospital or clinical setting?   I mean stuff like making sure the suction works, making sure the bed is made and the monitor is connected to the leads. That sort of thing."
StudentNurse,3bbd2b,Squid-bear,2,Sat Jun 27 20:22:53 2015 UTC,"I'm due to start my management placement in the UK,  I've been pretty fortunate to have mentors who wanted me to get as involved as possible, as such this is what I have been taught and generally would have hoped to know by my final placement:  Admissions and discharges.  Handovers   A basic understanding of TRAK (I get the training is mostly post reg)  Injections - subcutaneous and intramuscular   A basic understanding of venepuncture (though I think it's stupid that you don't get this training until after registration unless you're a midwife).  Blood transfusions - how to check that you have the correct bag and patients and know your time constraints and that obs need to be done regularly  BLS.  Catheters - female at least though have assisted in male (as yet again not allowed during training) and i don't understand why registration is required for it as it's not exactly difficult.   Peg feed set up and administration of meds via peg feed.  Wound management   TR band removal (if in a cardiac ward)   Paperwork - risk assessments, audits, care plans etc.  Moving and Handling with a stand aid, hoist, samhall turner etc.  Administration of medicines and controlled drugs e.g procedures, which are safe to be crushed etc.  Pharmacology, you should know what basic drug groups do, which ones thin blood or cause constipation, what a safe dose is as there is always a doctor out there who can't write a prescription to save their life!   How to set up a drip and make calculations.   Personal care - pad change, bed baths, showers, shaving and nail care.  Communication - mostly just being friendly and approachable, the old dears I'm currently caring for adore me, they may have dementia but still enjoy a good joke or a bit of flattery. Likewise kids and young adults like to be reassured that they aren't alone, I do a lot of bank shifts in neurology as I've been a frequent visitor myself for seizures and I know how scary and hopeless it can feel when you start getting them but it does get better with time.  However, rarely these patients are given anyone to relate to or staff are too busy to stop and chat, so I make time for them.   Which brings me to time management and case loads.   Hmm not sure what else, I just came off a shift so kind of foggy but can add if I think of anything more."
StudentNurse,3bbd2b,msega1988,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:28:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. See this is what I would expect of a final year. But then when the student does not do these things, how can I help them when they should have learnt it all in the last 2.5years."
StudentNurse,3bbd2b,AmyClemx,2,Sat Jun 27 20:34:44 2015 UTC,"I would ask them why they haven't and then work out from there a plan that works for you both to make sure it's learnt.  There may be a good reason for it, whilst I've had very good mentors I've also had really bad ones who clearly had only done the mentorship training in the hopes of a pay raise.    I had one placement in a care home where mentoring consisted of screaming at me on a daily basis about how shit I was whilst refusing to teach me anything, then telling the band 2s that I was not to be assisted with the patients that required 2 on 1 handling (apparently pt safety not a thing there). It was my first elderly care placement and as such I didn't learn a thing other than how not to be a nurse and it made me question my place on the course. I've only learnt elderly care in my current placement after my mentor saw I was terrified of the place and asked why, she's been great and really hands on and I now love it.   Alternatively they may have had placements in non traditional areas, I've not been in a proper ward up until recently so it's only now I've gotten the chance to really know my patients, do personal care or work with complex care needs, until then I saw my patients for maybe two days tops for minor surgical procedures or to weigh babies."
StudentNurse,3bbd2b,woshinoob,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:52:12 2015 UTC,"I would search your schools clinical information for a document that outlines limitations. You may be able to do certain things as long as you have supervision, where as other areas have it set up that the nurse precepting must do those acts ie. blood transfusion, narcotics"
StudentNurse,3b8ml0,blachool,7,Fri Jun 26 21:20:31 2015 UTC,Do it now. It's fine. The point of a two step is to sensitize an individual who was exposed a long time ago but whose body didn't react for the first one. They would react for the second one. The sensitivity didn't go away. It only takes 48 hours. Do it right away and it'll be done by Wednesday.
StudentNurse,3b8ml0,NurseSexKitten,3,Fri Jun 26 21:50:39 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice :)
StudentNurse,3b8ml0,gingerhater21,2,Fri Jun 26 22:01:16 2015 UTC,You will be fine if you go into your doctor or even an urgent care type place today. You'll have to have the shot again (the first step) and then have it read a few days later (the second step) but it can be given and read pretty much anywhere.
StudentNurse,3b8ml0,gingerhater21,2,Sat Jun 27 00:38:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Do you think I would be safe to get it done Monday and read Wednesday? Don't think many places will be open this weekend nearby. Also, you're talking about getting the second step done, right?"
StudentNurse,3b8ml0,sge77b,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:49:32 2015 UTC,"So after the initial shot, the test needs to be read within 48-72 hours. You can do it on Monday but I would be sure to get into the office early. If you choose to do it this weekend I'm sure you can find a place near you. I would just call any local clinic, urgent care office or even some Walgreens do the testing. also heres a CDC link about the skin test that you may find helpful http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/testing/skintesting.htm"
StudentNurse,3b8ml0,Wayward-Soul,0,Sat Jun 27 01:45:13 2015 UTC,Due the Tb Interferon Gold test instead. It fulfills the requirement of a two step Tb test. This happened to me right before I got into nursing school. Later I was told by the school that this was an option. Luckily I didn't need to do it because it is a pricy test.
StudentNurse,3b8ml0,sge77b,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:48:34 2015 UTC,Assumoing they accept the test that is. My nursing school requires the two step but i was just hired on at a local hospital. The hospital ran a blood titer (a better test than the PPD) but my school still required me to do another PPD.
StudentNurse,3b8ml0,denizen564,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:32:00 2015 UTC,Good luck. Doesn't hurt to check.
StudentNurse,3b8ml0,FearAndLoafing,-2,Sat Jun 27 05:48:17 2015 UTC,How could we possibly know? Call HR of the hospital you are going to be interning at.
StudentNurse,3b8ml0,FearAndLoafing,6,Fri Jun 26 21:39:48 2015 UTC,Perhaps someone has been in a similar situation and would know. I don't think I'm asking a crazy question in a student nurse subreddit and it's the best place I can get help considering the place I got my TB at is closed right now.
StudentNurse,3b7smm,nta333,2,Fri Jun 26 17:39:07 2015 UTC,This probably isn't very helpful but I went to school in Chicago and had many friends here from California. They took their boards in Illinois and then  applied for reciprocity to California because that process is actually faster.
StudentNurse,3b7smm,NurseSexKitten,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for your response!  That is very interesting and actually pretty smart.  If I could go back in time, I would totally go this route but at this point, I don't think I could get all of that done in the next 2 - 3 weeks plus traveling to another state to test, etc.  I posted this same question to our cohort's FB page and a few people that I went to school with have received their ATTs but they registered at the beginning of April.  So based on that, I'm guessing I will receive my ATT sometime around the middle of July, it's just going to be cutting it very close and is making me very nervous.  As if I wasn't nervous enough just to sit for the NCLEX.  I know there will be other jobs but I REALLY want to start this job in August.  It's going to be an interesting 3 weeks :).  Thanks again!!"
StudentNurse,3b7smm,NurseSexKitten,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:39:37 2015 UTC,Also keep in mind you don't have to sit for the test in the state you are testing for. Chicago test dates fill up way in advance so I took mine in Wisconsin because I could get an earlier date there. So I sat for the Illinois board of nursing in Wisconsin. The testing centers are national and accept applicants from any state. So if you can't get an open date within a reasonable amount of time in California it may be time for a road trip! Good luck!!!
StudentNurse,3b7smm,aphrodite-walking,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:40:57 2015 UTC,"That's good to know.  I live in San Diego so I was already thinking I might have to drive to LA (or farther) if I need to test within a few days of receiving the ATT.  If all else fails, I'm willing to drive to Arizona or Nevada if it's the difference between getting this job or not.  Thanks!"
StudentNurse,3b7smm,aphrodite-walking,2,Fri Jun 26 22:39:26 2015 UTC,The CA BON is super backed up right now. Some of the new grad IP nurses at our hospital are saying they've heard November may be the month they get their ATT.
StudentNurse,3b7smm,azbartender,2,Fri Jun 26 20:02:34 2015 UTC,"November???  Wow!!  I think I'm lucky because I finished school the end of April (I was in an ABSN program) and registered with the state of CA on May 1st.  I think a lot of people who were at traditional schools didn't finish until later in May or June.  The last time I spoke to someone at the BON, they said they were processing applicants from the beginning of April and that was 1.5 weeks ago.  So, I'm really hoping I can sit for the NCLEX sometime next month.....we'll see.  Thanks for your response!"
StudentNurse,3b7smm,Henessey123,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:07:52 2015 UTC,No problem! I believe they finished in June. Luckily they can work under another RN in the mean time but it sucks waiting months to take the dang test. Hopefully you hear back soon!
StudentNurse,3b7smm,Henessey123,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:12:44 2015 UTC,"Ya, that really does suck.  I took the 4-day Kaplan review the beginning of May thinking I would test the beginning of June and now I'm starting to worry that I paid all that money and will forget everything by the time I can actually take the test.  That is nice they can work under another RN, I'll have to check with my hospital to see what they say about that...thanks again!"

StudentNurse,3b7smm,destroyingtocreate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:39:59 2015 UTC,Are you sure your school sent in the necessary documentation to the state after you graduated?
StudentNurse,3b7smm,Warpek,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:55:56 2015 UTC,Yes because a few people I graduated with have received their ATTs and taken the NCLEX.  They registered way before me though.  I wish I would have known it was going to take this long...I was thinking 3 - 4 weeks max.  It's very frustrating...
StudentNurse,3b7smm,CopaceticGeek,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:58:57 2015 UTC,How frustrating! I am waiting on my school to even send my stuff and I graduated 3 weeks ago. I don't understand what takes so long. I hope you get the ATT soon!
StudentNurse,3b7smm,mayx2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:32:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Ya, it's super frustrating.  I am usually a very patient person but with this job offer on the line, it's stressing me out.  Good luck!"
StudentNurse,3b41e5,shayshay33,8,Thu Jun 25 20:08:03 2015 UTC,"Best of luck! Remember, most people that pass feel like they failed miserably during and after the test. Treat yourself to something nice after the test and try your best to relax."
StudentNurse,3b41e5,Llamapants,4,Thu Jun 25 20:13:23 2015 UTC,How do you find out about cancellations???  Other than checking every day?  I've been trying to move up my test date for weeks...
StudentNurse,3b41e5,azbartender,3,Thu Jun 25 20:28:39 2015 UTC,"yeah, i just checked periodically.  I found that there really arent cancellations, unless you are willing to go the next day. I logged on this morning and found two for tomorrow morning at different locations.  I looked previously and found a couple of next day times, but I wasnt ready to take it quite yet."
StudentNurse,3b41e5,azbartender,3,Thu Jun 25 21:19:46 2015 UTC,I guess I'll just keep checking...
StudentNurse,3b41e5,carson3456,3,Thu Jun 25 22:40:08 2015 UTC,I have rescheduled mine twice for more than 2 days out twice now. Just have to keep checking.

StudentNurse,3b5mud,Kohkan3,3,Fri Jun 26 04:10:16 2015 UTC,"Saturation depends on where in the country you are. It's not so saturated that you won't be able to find a job, but it's saturated enough that you'll have to look for a job.  Nursing was saturated for the last couple years. That had more to do with the economy than demand. It's reversing now as the economy improves, as you see with your classmates not struggling to find jobs.  What you need to think about is if direct entry is a good idea. I think a year or two of experience is REALLY important, and find it...odd, that direct entry even exists.  Add on the fact that this will be predominantly online, and I think you should reevaluate. You will come out with the degree and credentials, but will you really be a good practitioner with no experience and an entirely online grad program?"
StudentNurse,3b5mud,OfMurseAndMan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:09:30 2015 UTC,"I'll still be working as a nurse while I get my masters, by the time I graduate I'll have 2-3 years of experience. Also i didn't realize the programs were  still in class. Almost every state school here (including the two prestigious ones here) has their FNP or DNP program completely online. I figure that was just the norm and people just picked the best online program for them."
StudentNurse,3b5mud,OfMurseAndMan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:30:28 2015 UTC,They aren't all online. Not that I think some of them aren't okay. Just do your research before going through one.  Good luck!
StudentNurse,3b5mud,aislinnanne,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:40:15 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought direct entry programs were for people with non nursing BSs. All the ones I looked into were that way. If you already have a BSN, wouldn't you be looking at tradition NP programs?"
StudentNurse,3b5mud,ajh1717,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:54:13 2015 UTC,All the ones I've seen and I've been looking at have been direct entry for BSNs
StudentNurse,3b5mud,aislinnanne,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:54:34 2015 UTC,You cant be a NP without a BSN.  Direct entry NP programs take brand new BSN grads with no work experience.
StudentNurse,3b32v0,throw13009,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:57:31 2015 UTC,"Ultimately it will come down to what is manageable for you and will make you happy.  I will say that working and getting through nursing school is very doable.  It just requires a lot of time management and organization.  I worked all the way through nursing school and still had time to do things that I enjoyed.  I also really don't think that it would be too difficult to work while taking anatomy and studying for TEAS... honestly, that sounds like a dream compared to some of my semesters in nursing school.  Really though, it's all about what's best for you.  Maybe continue with your job since you're unsure, start your anatomy course and studying for your TEAS, and then reassess?  You can always reduce your hours later or quit if it's overwhelming."
StudentNurse,3b32v0,wadgim,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:27:54 2015 UTC,I forgot to mention that the Fall schedule just came out. The anatomy course will be T/R and I work M-F from 12-8pm. I understand that I will need to figure out whats comfortable for me. Thanks for the advice!

StudentNurse,3b1ai7,Unmarried_Mother,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:04:47 2015 UTC,"Good luck I used my GI bill for an ABSN program too.  I was unable to get any FAFSA money since I all ready had a degree but there where lots of scholarships available from my school and the state.  Filling out all the paperwork and writing essays is very time consuming.  Like with cover letters write a general one and tweak it for the individual applications.  I also used a website called fastweb to look for and apply to scholarships.    I didn't even try to work during school it was 12 months and too intense for me to work and pass classes.  I squeaked by on money I had saved and BAH.  I ate a lot of rice and peanut butter sandwiches.  It can be pretty overwhelming some days, but it is over very quick, so get ready to embrace the suck."
StudentNurse,3b1ai7,manimel,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:12:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. Yes, cover letters are a PITA. Nevertheless, my school is pretty veteran-friendly and I hope this shows in August when more scholarships open.   I constantly read stories here about not being able to work while in school. Push comes to shove, I can handle that but some aid money would be nice to alleviate the pressure.  Did you end up getting any scholarships?"
StudentNurse,3b1ai7,manimel,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"I got one for 2000.  which is not much in the grand scheme of things, but it paid some bills and let me have a night out.  My school was over so quick, everything I applied for was 6-10months out so I would have gotten them as I was graduating.  My suggestion is to cut out every non essential bill cause you wont really have time for extra stuff anyway.  Our class had one girl who worked and did the program that actually graduated.  Each program is different if your program can accomodate it go for it.  But keep in mind that the degree is the highest priority.  It is worth the effort in my opinion.  If you have any questions let me know.  I got a soft spot for fellow vets, so if I can help them along I will."
StudentNurse,3b1ai7,12345hey,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:35:42 2015 UTC,You should try to work part time. I just graduated from a 12 month program and was told that we should not work. A lot of my classmates worked and I really regret it because it would have been nice to have extra money. There is also some lag time between finals/ graduation/ nclex and you can't study for the nclex during all that time becuase it would drive you crazy.

The reason I say that is because Pearson Vue still wouldn't show me my results even though I could already see my license number.  So check your name on the board of nursing!
StudentNurse,3aw3ru,tjh28,4,Wed Jun 24 02:17:07 2015 UTC,"I just did a mach NCLEX today where I woke up at the exact time I will that day, ate the same breakfast, sat in an upright chair, and did 265 questions. It was good to see that it took me approximately 4 hours and, according to Kaplan scores, did well! My mind started to go hazy at like 130! I hope I don't get that many but at least I know I can handle it! I really hope you passed!"

I went and talked to the counselor about what I would need to improve to apply again the next semester and he was being very fidgety and odd. I left his office thinking that he might have actually been on drugs because of his behavior. He called me the next day saying I got in and he had been trying to ""tell me without telling me"" when I was in his office. Turns out I'm just a little slow. ;)"

When I contacted my admissions dean she wrote a lot of keywords: ""Be optimistic"", "" Anything can happen"", and stuff like that.  Maybe I'm overthinking of it, but I feel that she's trying to tell me that I'm fairly high up. So far 3 people have been called off waitlist. So here's hoping I'm number 4 or 5!"

StudentNurse,3av97c,3dogs3catsandahedgeh,12,Tue Jun 23 19:54:13 2015 UTC,"We are missing something.  Surely you had a mid-term evaluation where your weaknesses were identified to you and strategies for success were talked about.    I would find it difficult to believe that they just put an F on your transcript and told you that was it, you are out of the program."
StudentNurse,3av97c,AmosParnell,5,Tue Jun 23 20:34:15 2015 UTC,It may not be the particular case that the individual got an F in the course. There are some programs that will fail a student for getting less than 80% in the coursework.
StudentNurse,3av97c,CopaceticGeek,3,Tue Jun 23 20:39:31 2015 UTC,"True. In my program below 80% is a failure. You get one chance during your first semester only. After that you'll be asked to leave for a grade below 79.5, even if it's your first."
StudentNurse,3av97c,clear_three,8,Tue Jun 23 20:54:15 2015 UTC,I hope your school's pass rate is extraordinarily high.  I never understood why some school's have such high standards but their NCLEX pass rate is only mediocre.
StudentNurse,3av97c,CopaceticGeek,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:00:56 2015 UTC,"The community college across town from my university has this exact same problem.  They boot people out left abd right (+60% attrition), and yet their NCLEX pass average has been below 80% for two and a half years.  One more semester, and their accreditation will be put on probation.  Madness."
StudentNurse,3av97c,TorchIt,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:45:38 2015 UTC,That's crazy! Ours is 50% (it was just recently boosted to 60% for the semesters after ours). We have one of the highest pass rates in the province for our national exam (Canada).

StudentNurse,3av97c,Pumpkin214,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:36:40 2015 UTC,"At my community college program, you have to have a 78% or above in every class. If you end the semester with less than a 77.5 (they round up) you get dropped from the program and have to reapply for the next year. If you get accepted into the program again, you have to test out of every class you passed. If you fail any of those tests, you have to retake those classes as well as the ones you failed... even though you passed them the first time. If you fail out the 2nd time... you're done. You don't get another try at that school."
StudentNurse,3av97c,TarynCakes,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:40:54 2015 UTC,"My nursing program is a 75% to pass and the curriculum is extremely difficult. The NCLEX pass rate is 98% but the program pass rate is only about 70%. If a student scores under 75%, that's it, they cannot continue with the rest of the class. No reviews or evaluations. If a student is struggling, they expect them to just fix it."
StudentNurse,3av97c,BeatrixKidd,0,Sun Jul 5 17:08:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, I had a midterm evaluation. I had significant problems with satisfying my clinical instructor on my nursing care plans. They were very long and detailed, over 80 pages, and she did not agree with my diagnoses or with my treatment plans. She gave me one chance to rewrite and pass, and I failed on them. I had the right to come back to the program in the fall, but as I said, I would have had three more semesters of school. I would rather spend that time pursuing the PA program, since that's where I was going in the first place."
StudentNurse,3av97c,nguyencs,3,Tue Jun 23 22:55:52 2015 UTC,80 pages? wtf.  I've never done more than 4 pages.

StudentNurse,3av97c,captain_thrace,-5,Tue Jun 23 21:48:35 2015 UTC,I had no problem with the theory end of it; my problem was with the care plans. It didn't help that I had the most difficult clinical instructor in the program.
StudentNurse,3av97c,abc123nurse,21,Tue Jun 23 22:57:07 2015 UTC,"And when you do poorly on the first one, you go to office hours, have your professors walk you through it, and do better from then on.   I know that a lot of people on this sub don't believe me, but nursing school really isn't that difficult compared to a lot of other programs. There's a lot more bullshit, but it's not difficult.   You failing is not your instructor's fault."
StudentNurse,3av97c,captain_thrace,2,Tue Jun 23 23:09:53 2015 UTC,"I know that a lot of people on this sub don't believe me, but nursing school really isn't that difficult compared to a lot of other programs. There's a lot more bullshit, but it's not difficult.    It depends on your school.  You don't hear these horror stories about chem e or stem fields.  It is when you get told 2 different things buy 2 different instructors and have 2 different textbooks that say two different things.    My nursing school experiance can be summed up litterly ""What in the hell do you want me to do?""  Nursing education was the most fucked up thing I have experienced.  My ex school is pushing 60% attrition for ADN.  We had about 30% fail/quit after the first two semesters.  100% fail quit for males and there is 1 minority female left last I heard.  I honestly think think it will be 100% white women by the time it is done.   I don't know of any guys   I just don't understand it.  It shouldn't have been as hard as it was.  It was hard because they were making it hard.  I decided I wasn't going to keep putting effort into something that could be a coin flip.  No matter how much I studied the NCLEX questions were ridiculous.  Anything below 80% would have end the program for me.  Beyond that we had enough subjectivity in the grading if a professor didn't like you, it would be easy to fail you.  It's a joke.  They need to start holding schools accountable for attrition rates."
StudentNurse,3av97c,TorchIt,-4,Fri Jun 26 02:38:54 2015 UTC,"I am not blaming my instructor. I did go to someone for help. I really, really detest care plans as our school did them. They were seriously over 80 pages long, and my instructor would only allow a particular care plan book.  I am more interested in science, and had difficulty justifying the incredibly detailed plans they wanted. Part of my problem is that I didn't believe she would fail me on the care plan. She also failed another student who had completed all the prerequisites for med school. Neither of us had any problem with any other class. He's debating continuing as well."
StudentNurse,3av97c,Sunflowerslove,4,Tue Jun 23 23:18:45 2015 UTC,"I mean, I understand. I think care plans are bullshit too.   But we're really not going to give you a lot of sympathy here, sorry. If you failed the first time and thought it was unreasonable, there are a lot of other options.   It's fine if you had difficulty justifying it, but it was what was required of you to pass the course."

StudentNurse,3av97c,justatouchcrazy,3,Wed Jun 24 02:26:50 2015 UTC,"That's just such an absurd number I don't believe them.  80 pages total during the semester or for several patients sure, but each?  EDIT: Even my anesthesia care plans, which are very detailed and have a ton of detail are rarely over 10 pages.  A a lot of that can be copy/paste at a certain point, so the most I'm generating per shift is about 60 pages, much of which I didn't write but rather just edited."
StudentNurse,3av97c,abc123nurse,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:13:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah seems a bit like they he/she may be embellishing a bit with 80 pages. Ours were about 15-20 pages before they were redone, now only 7-10. I can't believe that someone would make you do 80 pages, what would you fill it with?"
StudentNurse,3av97c,abc123nurse,2,Thu Jun 25 14:07:32 2015 UTC,"I can see 80 pages if that's your final for the year, if you basically take a 4 page care plan and write a page long description of each step, med or disease.  But that's a capstone type of assignment, not a weekly project."
StudentNurse,3av97c,linnnie,2,Thu Jun 25 14:13:11 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry.  I had a similar experience.  I posted about it to another user in this thread.  We lost over 30% in the first two semesters of an ADN program from fails and quits.  I quit but I had an out.    I made the mistake of putting down I had an advanced degree.  I think some of these teachers get off on busting guys/people they don't like.  I just was getting really bad vibes.  Just subtle jabs here and there from her.  Didn't really want to meet with me when I had some questions.  I just didn't see anyway to win anymore.  That wasn't the only reason I quit but it was part of it.  I quit with a nearly 4.0 (can i round up) lol.  Screw it.   She also failed another student who had completed all the prerequisites for med school. Neither of us had any problem with any other class. He's debating continuing as well.    Are you both male?   I'm not sure my school as passed more than a male or two.  I know of only one guy that passed the program.  When I left my class all the guys failed/quit.  Same as well as all but one of the minorities.  The class is highly lacking in diversity.    I just couldn't risk wasting all that time and money to have 1 class failure end it all.  You got to pick your nursing school carefully.    Edit I see you are female.  Doesn't change that I think some teachers fail people they don't like.  Go read your manual and file grievances.  I know someone who fought and won.
StudentNurse,3av97c,linnnie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:54:23 2015 UTC,We lost most of our guys as well. I have no idea why.
StudentNurse,3av97c,Generoh,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:52:58 2015 UTC,We lost most of our guys as well. I have no idea why.   I do.  :(  If I ever go back my questions I will ask before starting any program.    Anyways read your operations manual.  Go talk to the one teacher that said your care plan is good.  See what they think.  You have limited time to file a grievance most times but if it is subjective and you did well on the tests it might be worth fighting especially if you are going to apply to PA school.  Good luck.
StudentNurse,3av97c,youwonannaward,3,Fri Jun 26 19:34:19 2015 UTC,"Can you reach out about the situation to your dean? I mean you should, and ask about your clinical instructors evaluations from other students, even in previous semesters. If you feel like the grade was unfair, contest the grade. There has to be something in your handbook or something. A B in the class and failing clinical because of a fucking care plan is out of this world. To be honest, this makes not a whole bunch of sense to me. There's only so many nursing diagnoses for each patient. I feel for yah! I hope you figure things out soon."
StudentNurse,3av97c,yodudeits,0,Wed Jun 24 02:37:19 2015 UTC,"I have been afraid to contact the dean. I'm embarrassed to see anyone from my program, because I feel like a failure."

StudentNurse,3av97c,TorchIt,9,Thu Jun 25 17:46:27 2015 UTC,"I mean this in the nicest way possible but are you sure you'll be okay in PA school? If so, thats great, but you said you feel like you wasted the last year of your life and I have heard that PA school is harder than NP school. Just a thought, and best of luck!"
StudentNurse,3av97c,organicvegetable,5,Tue Jun 23 20:44:07 2015 UTC,"If one instructor was the reason you had to leave the program, bring your care plans to another instructor and get a second opinion on your work. If they find nothing wrong, then petition your way back into the program. Any PA school is going to ask you what happened in nursing school, so be sure to think about what you'd tell them about this, too..."
StudentNurse,3av97c,DanKC,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:14:17 2015 UTC,I already did that. The other instructor had helped me with the second attempt. She said it was well written.
StudentNurse,3av97c,ThatChickFromReddit,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:48:32 2015 UTC,I already did that. The other instructor had helped me with the second attempt. She said it was well written.   You need to potentially file an academic grievance especially if your other instructor said they were good.  Now they might now back you but at this point I'd say you don't have much to lose.  Your time is potentially limited.  Even if you drop out of the program after that getting that grade fixed is probably worth the effort.  Go ready you college and course manual.
StudentNurse,3av97c,TorchIt,5,Fri Jun 26 03:18:35 2015 UTC,"PA school is going to be harder than your MedSurg course.  I say this not to discourage you, but instead, to encourage you to set your life up in a manner that will help ensure success in your new program.  Were you working during nursing school?  If so, don't make that same mistake again.  Did you plan out study time in blocs and adhere to that schedule?  Did you make a calendar with all of your test and assignment dates?  Did you utilize your classmates as a study resource?  This is how you can successfully become a PA.  Anything less will probably not be enough if you struggled in nursing school.  If you honestly did all of this and still failed?  Then you'll have to double down on all of it."
StudentNurse,3av97c,msega1988,2,Tue Jun 23 22:35:08 2015 UTC,"I didn't struggle with studying; my problem was nursing care plans. My clinical instructor would not pass me on them. I had a high B in both theory and clinical, but she failed me on the paper."
StudentNurse,3av97c,msega1988,3,Tue Jun 23 22:53:11 2015 UTC,"the exact same thing happened to me. they told me if i got my cna license they'd let me back in the following year. i got back in, had a new clinical instructor, and didnt fail a single care plan despite doing nothing different. keep your head up, and see if your school has a reentry policy"
StudentNurse,3av97c,420N0SCOPE_BlaZEiT,3,Tue Jun 23 23:04:41 2015 UTC,"If what you're saying is truly factual, then it's an easy fix.  Dust yourself off, do what you have to do to beg your way back into the program, and avoid that instructor like she has the plague.    Your interviewers for PA admission are going to ask what the hell happened if you just shrug and walk away from your nursing degree.  Your best shot to reach your ultimate goal is to get back at it."

StudentNurse,3anpty,SO_HOMO,2,Mon Jun 22 14:52:41 2015 UTC,Just an update: I spoke to the admissions dean and she said that I was in the top half of the waitlist. She couldnt give me an exact number due to their policies though.  I also found out through a friend that most of the regular cohort has not confirmed their acceptance and that a few (not many) have not accepted the accelerated invite.  They need to RSVP by the 1st of July. So all in all pretty solid news!
StudentNurse,3anpty,adnstudent,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:21:44 2015 UTC,"They're not allowed to tell me what place I'm in. However, the total list is 31 (for the 72 seats). So I can only hope that I'm fairly high up.  I have two friends who were in similar situations and they both got into that school. It's just devastating when you have a gut feeling and it just slaps you in the face"

StudentNurse,3ajg6w,Stineyd,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:05:55 2015 UTC,I didn't do a single arts or crafts related thing. I just walked around and helped with a couple of the activities and then hung out with some residents before helping to transport around 25 of them to the auditorium to play bingo. I'm with the recreation office for now but I'm hoping to transition into being a one-on-one visiting volunteer where I'd spend all my time just visiting with bed-bound residents in their rooms.
StudentNurse,3ajg6w,vivestalin,2,Sun Jun 21 12:45:41 2015 UTC,That was exactly how I felt after my first day of CNA clinicals :)
StudentNurse,3ajg6w,_tarasbulba,2,Sat Jun 20 23:11:56 2015 UTC,"I've had a similar experience to you. I'm in the UK training to be a mental health nurse and I've had two placements so far. The first was physical health, an acute geriatric ward, and the second an older adults mental health unit. I was absolutely dreading it for the same reasons as you, but I came to really love it.   The physical placement involved a lot of personal care, with most of the patients being bed bound and doubly incontinent. The first week was really hard, seeing people who were clearly in a lot of pain and who couldn't control their bowels/bladder. It very quickly became a non-issue though. I managed to overcome my personal discomfort so that I could try to provide first class care for them. The second day I helped an older gentleman use a commode and a couldn't stop gagging, but on my final day I watched someone rub their C.Diff diarrhoea all over the his face, and he had a full beard. But I hardly batted an eyelid! The journey that I went on on that placement was incredible.   The placement that I am on now is approximately 90% people with dementia, with most of them presenting with challenging/disruptive behaviour (it's an acute assessment unit). I've found that my skills in engaging with people have developed so much. I initially found it difficult to interact with people who sometimes don't even know who they are, never mind where they are or why they are there. However I'm enjoying it more and more every day as my understanding of their specific needs develops. Understanding exactly why Mr. A reacts the way he does to certain prompts and why Mr. B needs certain care has been a really wonderful learning experience and it's really changed my opinion of working in older adult care."
StudentNurse,3ajg6w,Socrateswasacowboy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:27:47 2015 UTC,I work at a nursing home. It's exhausting.
StudentNurse,3ajg6w,StefaniePags,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:17:44 2015 UTC,"I did a month in a nursing home before starting my current job. I like the geriatric population, and I liked getting to see the same ones every day for weeks.  In my current position on a Med/Surg floor in a hospital, I work 12 hour shifts, so I see the patients for two days, and by the time I come back a few days later, they are gone, or I get a different assignment anyway. I also liked the clear delineation between RN and CNA. Of course we could help each other if needed, but I felt like my CNA (each RN assignment was paired with a CNA) did her job and I did mine, and it was very smooth. In my hospital job, there is a large gray area of things that we both do that leads to a ""I'm busy..... no I'm busier"" atmosphere with certain RN/tech pairings.   I did not like the low pay, 8 hour shifts, 45 minute commute, or the feeling that management was just looking for any excuse to write people up."

Unless the hospital has a ban on electronics, which do occur, my uses aren't a HIPAA concern or anything I'd need to ""relearn"" later.

Algebra was the same, I suck at Math and ended up failing Pre-Algebra and teaching myself at home, at my own pace. I was able to test out of the courses thankfully. My core NUR classes have been challenging, but for me, it's a just a different kind of hard, if I had to continue doing strictly Chem and Mathematics, I don't think I would remain successful :/"

They may have hiring fairs and stuff like that.    In my town I had a job lined up about 2 months before graduation.  It all depends on the hiring climate in your area.  Some areas are in need of lots of nurses. So they will take on new grads others don't have too because there are plenty of experienced nurses floating around.  I ended up staying in the city I got my degree from because they would hire new grads.

StudentNurse,3aebqu,Futurenurse2018,7,Fri Jun 19 12:48:18 2015 UTC,"The burn out for any medical practitioner is caused by not being able to help someone. Am EMT will get it when the person at an accident is a fatality, a nurse will get it when the patient is suffering and they can't help them, and even doctors get it when they can't heal a patient. You may not feel that you're doing anything to help your patients, but you are. Giving them the care and attention they need is crucial. As a CNA, you're giving them comfort and care that other staff don't have the time to give. As a nurse, you'd have different responsibilities. As a physician, those responsibilities would change again. Think about why you're frustrated. It will give you an idea of what career you'd want in health care."

If you feel like you personally can't handle the ""sick"" side of medicine, there are other fields you can go into such as wellness checkups at Dr.'s offices, well-baby visits, or the business side of nursing. You could go a whole career without having to take care of a sick person."

StudentNurse,3aebqu,Rednights,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:55:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but if you quit after 3 shifts as a CNA, then I doubt medical or nursing school are for you. You have good days and bad, but more or less have to have some degree of excitement over being in the medical field that trumps the nuts and bolts of a work day.  You have to get through 2 years of getting your head kicked in for Nursing or another 6 to 8 to be an MD. Some are beautiful and lots are tragedy. I was a CNA before I was a nurse. I put people in body bags for my first 5 shifts in a row. It never crossed my mind I to hang it up.   There are things you can be a fan of and find interesting, and there are things you can participate in and contribute to... and the former doesn't always lead to the latter. If you're interested in the science and helping people without the stomach for patient care, I would stay in the lab aspect of medical research or something like that. There is nothing wrong with that, patient care is not for everyone. There are options outside of bedside after school, but those people struggle to get through the program.   Ask yourself what you really want out of your career. From your post it sounds like being an MD sounded like good in your head and nursing was a tolerable consolation prize. You'll have to have more than that to keep you in the game. Nursing school is a fucking nightmare and medical school is worse than that. What gets everyone through is a passion for the goal. Anything medical is not a good choice if you land on it just because you can't think of anything else."
StudentNurse,3aebqu,Quorum_Sensing,2,Sat Jun 20 02:30:32 2015 UTC,Another reason I quit is because I was getting free school at the job I have currently. I just had so many things running through my head. Also the trainer that I had didn't like me and wouldn't help me learn she kept leaving me every second she could. I had an emotional roller coaster going on. Also I have seen two autopsies and when I saw those I fell in love with it. That's what I though I was going to feel when I started nursing. Instead I had doubt. I think the real thing was is that I didn't know how I was going to pay for school so I panicked and it also made me realize that I can become a nurse without being a CNA so that almost sounded way better to me.
StudentNurse,3aebqu,Quorum_Sensing,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:25:48 2015 UTC,"Nursing is people and all of the messiness of lives and families and unit drama. Nurses also have to do everything CNA's do. They are there to help. If they are busy...it's on you. You may not get a job on a unit with CNA's, then you do total care all the time. My unit is like that. You can avoid most of your gripes, but your biggest concern will be getting through school and you have no say there.  So you like chemistry and the autopsy was exciting but the patient care not so much? What about pathology? Have you shadowed any other positions? That is really a low stress way to see if something is going to be a good fit."
StudentNurse,3aebqu,Quorum_Sensing,2,Sat Jun 20 03:46:45 2015 UTC,Well I shadowed a medical examiner and she said I could intern once I went to my university. Pathology is all I read about and watch and want. I feel like I was made to do it. But it's like 8 more years of school. I feel like I could do it though no matter what the amount. I also don't care that there aren't many jobs either. I love pathology so much that I would work for free. Seriously. When I shadowed our medical examiner I just felt that I fit in. She even told me she started out with taking care of patients and got sick of them not taking their medications that she decided to do something without patients and that is what she ended up doing. Plus a bachelors in chemistry can also lead to medschool and a toxicologist if I don't get into medschool. I also love tissues and looking at them through a microscope. It's so fascinating.
StudentNurse,3aebqu,Quorum_Sensing,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:31:52 2015 UTC,"I love pathology so much that I would work for free. Seriously.   There it is. You answered your own question. That was how I felt about Nursing. There are a lot of jobs where you grind your way though the education for a better end. Anything medicine related you don't usually survive the education unless you have an affection for it. If you think you can keep your head about you through all of the non-pathology rotations, regardless of any emotional rollercoaster, you should persue that. As far as money goes, you'll borrow living expenses too like everyone else. So, actually you'll contribute more than you do now. I had a friend that was a Pathologist. I took him about a year to place and he had to leave the state for the job, but he got one. It's not like you'll never work. Good luck!"
StudentNurse,3aebqu,potted_petunias,2,Sat Jun 20 14:29:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for talking to me. I think having outside help is what I needed. Plus you were able to have a little harsh criticism as well. Thanks really.
StudentNurse,3aebqu,lurknomoretoday,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:46:49 2015 UTC,"Glad it could help! I certainly don't mean to me harsh, but I do try to be direct. I saw a lot of my cohort not make it through the program and I saw a lot of people driving them on instead of being honest. I know the pushing was meant well, but it didn't help them.   It was not that they weren't smart and capable, but because they didn't play to their strengths and acknowledge reasonable weaknesses. Many of them moved on to successful careers after changing gears and I know all of them would say that they wished they done it sooner.   I think for  a lot of people, they become fixated in a margin of reference that that it's hard for them to be successful in. If I gauged my worth on the ability to sing opera I would perceive myself to be a failure. In the end, I'm just a guy on the internet. If you revisit nursing in a different environment and feel it's for you, then go for it. I just try to play devils advocate in an environment that I feel needs a little more realistic discussion. Shadow as much as you can. You'll find your way."
StudentNurse,3ag93a,thecoolestniggawhat,3,Fri Jun 19 22:09:44 2015 UTC,"I use the medical one. I actually thought I bought the nursing one but the medical one came, and after comparing it to my friend's nursing one, I liked mine better. If you're going to be working ICU/ED, definitely get the medical one"
StudentNurse,3ag93a,simple10,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:34:38 2015 UTC,Can you explain in what ways the medical one was more beneficial to you vs. what the nursing one provided?
StudentNurse,3ag93a,simple10,2,Sat Jun 20 01:35:04 2015 UTC,"The nursing one has a big section on IM injection sites, which I found as a waste of space because they're easy to know IMO. The medical one uses the X and fishtail diagram for labs (forget what it's called at the moment) which is used in my ICU and wasn't really taught in school. It also goes more into depth on ECG interpretation, and has your critical care hemodynamic parameters (cardiac index, PAOP, CVP, SVR/PVR) incase you forget those. Either clipboard is fine, but if you're doing critical care I'd definitely get the medical one"
StudentNurse,3ag93a,a___fib,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:24:54 2015 UTC,This was very helpful. Thanks! I know for sure that she knows the injection sites because she's talked about it enough that I remember some of them lol
StudentNurse,3ag93a,Vana21,2,Sat Jun 20 21:14:03 2015 UTC,I actually really love the Nursing clipboard! I'm not sure if any of the others besides the Medicine clipboard would be useful or not. But I think this would be a great gift! Very sweet. And definitely get her name etched on the clipboard. It's only a couple dollars extra and very convenient since it seems everyone has these!

StudentNurse,3aaowm,annastar,6,Thu Jun 18 16:27:57 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience when I took my exam on Monday. I took 2 hours and got 75 questions- I took an unscheduled break at 69 questions because I was getting a headache and felt a little dehydrated. During the NCLEX I read each question 2 or 3 times and thought out why I was choosing the answer I was choosing. I got about the same amount of SATA as well. What really helped was relaxing the day before. If anyone hasn't seen The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt it's hilarious and totally relaxed me the day before.  Edit: Took a break at 60 questions, wrote this on my phone."
StudentNurse,3aaowm,tjh28,5,Thu Jun 18 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"Congrats! I have mine in 48 hours and I'm stressed and feel like I know nothing. I will definitely try to keep it at the minimum, did you really feel turning off the question counter helpful because you weren't thinking about the number?"
StudentNurse,3aaowm,tjh28,2,Thu Jun 18 16:04:11 2015 UTC,"thank you!  And yes, absolutely.  I saw a post on here that suggested that and I highly recommend it.  Now, I did tell myself, that if I reach the two hour mark or whenever they say you can take a break, that I would see how many I did and then turn it back off.  I never reached that point though.  It felt like 75 because it was about the same amount of time that it was taking me to do the Kaplan QBanks.  During my long wait yesterday though, I sort of wished I had checked how many questions I did but really, it doesnt matter because I felt like it turned off sooner than I would have ever expected.  And I didn't feel like I did terribly shitty so I was like ""That HAD to have been 75!"""
StudentNurse,3aaowm,lurknomoretoday,2,Thu Jun 18 16:14:15 2015 UTC,I'll definitely try it out then. Thanks for the tips

This helps a lot and will read it again closer to my test date. And also congratulations!!! Yay!!"
StudentNurse,3aaowm,raspberry_blue_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:01:58 2015 UTC,"I am sure there is logic to the theory that the more SATAs you get, the better you're doing BUT don't get hung up on it.  I mean, easier said than done but just try not to analyze every question to assess if it's a passing level one or not.  The SATAs that DID get were fairly simple (or so I thought) and not at all the horrific ones I did on Kaplan.  I think on that QBank Practice Test #4 (the one that is ALL SATA or alternate format questions) I got like a 28%."
StudentNurse,3aaowm,raspberry_blue_,2,Fri Jun 19 15:07:39 2015 UTC,you used kaplan to study? i have NCLEX in a couple months... but im trying to get ideas now. i love kaplan. have heard some negative things about other sources...
StudentNurse,3aaowm,GnomeGuy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:33:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard anything negative about other study programs but I knew what worked best for me.  I felt that I was not going to review/relearn/learn new stuff from a condensed content program.  It's a cliche but I really wasn't about to try and go over four semesters' worth of material in 3-4 days.  I knew my weak areas and I TRIED to get strong in them (OB and meds, mainly) but really, just doing the Kaplan QBank and rationales is what got me through.  I mean, that AND knowing my content.  Lab values are useful too but there is no way I can memorize Mg, Cl, neutrophils, etc.  I know my core ones like Na and K and Hgb but the other stuff I said fuck it for now."

You have to obtain, hold, and continuously renew them  to keep them active throughout your nursing career.  Once you're hired, sometimes hospitals will pay for the course or the course will be taken during your working hours.  The courses also will count toward your CEUs for renewing your RN license.   Sometimes you can buy a package of programs and therefore, get them at a (technically) discounted rate.. If you choose to do something like that, definitely include BLS, ACLS... maybe PALS, and perhaps an EKG competency course.    TL;DR Spend the money cause you need the certs."
StudentNurse,3a8v7s,ajh1717,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:16:10 2015 UTC,"BLS, yes, ACLS no.  In majority of hospitals on ICUs and ERs require ACLS, the rest not so much."

StudentNurse,3a8v7s,tjh28,3,Fri Jun 19 04:26:37 2015 UTC,"Something all nurses should have and 'absolutely need' are two completely different things.  ACLS certifications are good for two years if I remember correctly. The med surg nurse who got ACLS two years ago but has never actually been in a real code is going to be about as useful as a nurse who does not have ACLS. It isn't their fault, but unless you deal with codes on a regular basis, you are going to forget everything unless you constantly review it, which lets be honest, people wont do.   There is a reason why most hospitals typically only require ACLS for ICUs and ERs. It is nice to have for other lower acuity units, but in reality when shit hits the fan unless you have constant experience with it, you wont remember much."

But if you absolutely MUST do something right now, I do have a couple ideas for tasks you could take on that could help you down the road:  1) Vitals. Revisit them (assuming you did them in CNA?). Do you know normal ranges? If one is elevated or low, what could that tell you about that patient? At what point is each vital critically high or low (i.e.: shit is hitting the fan)?  2) Memorize some lab values. Did they assign you a book about diagnostic tests? Like my school uses this Pagana book. Crack that sucker open and make yourself a list of the normal ranges of the more common lab values. For starters: RBC's, Hgb, Hct, WBCs, Platelets, Na, K, Mg, Cl, Ca, P, BUN, Creatinine, AST, ALT, Amylase, Lipase, pH, PaO2, PaCO2, Bicarb. I made a chart of these labs' normal ranges and hung it in front of my toilet (but I have a really patient husband). You probably won't need to have these memorized down pat right away, maybe not even in your first year, and it'll take a lot more time to learn what they all mean too, but doing some rote memorization over the next couple months may pay off down the road.  3) Assault--oops Auscultate your family. What I mean is start putting your stethoscope on people close to you to get a feel for it. Listen to their heart. Listen to their lungs. Listen to their gut gurgles. Learn expected placement of your scope. Your school will invariably have a way they want you to do it, but this will still give you a jumping off point.  But this is all stuff you will learn in time. There isn't a rush... Until you start, then it's breakneck speed! ;) Best of luck to you."

Your time for these people you love will GREATLY diminish once you begin nursing school. I am sure, as they love you, they understand this.........but it will be hard on you. So have some fun!!  I wouldn't worry about learning new concepts like ADPIE. That takes a very small amount of time to understand.  I would recommend reviewing your A&P. I wish I had before I started, but I didn't and had to review at at the same time I NEEDED it.  Good Luck!!!  Remember Fun mixed with a little A&P!!!"

I had issues with this through school.  I am used to staying up late and I would just get so tired sometimes it would be hard to focus at school.

That's the biggest thing. Now, time for the serious stuff.    Watch every TV show and movie you've been putting off because you're not going to have time to watch them while in nursing school.  Stock up on chocolate, candy, and soda. You're going to need it to reduce your stress Buy a coffee maker. Waking up a 4:30am was not fun.  Make yourself a hobbit hole.

StudentNurse,3a7cw4,justatouchcrazy,2,Wed Jun 17 20:39:43 2015 UTC,"What do you think?   Having known family members who have benefited from the care provided at hospital, I was pleased to learn of the new graduate guarantee position available in the CNS inpatient unit. I am interested in hospital because of its focus on patient care and safety, through discovery and innovation. The care that was provided to my family was exceptional and I believe that my own focus on excellence will allow me to be a great fit for this position.  I understand that a strong knowledge base and ability to critically think is integral to the nursing process. I have received a variety of scholarships, including  the name nursing scholarship for academic standing and interest in pursuing a career in the acute care. In addition, I have excelled in a variety of clinical placements, which have exposed me to neurological disorders. My strong assessment skills and attention to detail have allowed me to identify interventions to improve patient outcomes and act as a mentor for other students.   Furthermore, my strong time management skills have resulted in my ability to prioritized the care of a full patient assignment in both the emergency department setting and in an acute medical unit. I have adapted to sudden changes in patient’s acuity level as well as independently managing new admissions and discharges.   In addition to my university experience, I have demonstrated my ability work well within a team. During my time working at a summers camp as a medical assistant, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a nurse and our camp directors. Through this relationship we were able to create a new documentation system to facilitate the continuum of care and to provide safer medication administration to our campers.   I'm eager to find out more about the new graduate program and the employment opportunities at hospital. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you soon."

I would personally choose ER, ICU, CCU, DOU.. something that's more critical than medsurg. That way, when you are listing your skills/knowledge on a resume, you'll be able to say that you have had ""extensive"" experience on a unit that requires a higher level of patient care, higher level of assessment, monitoring, and evaluation - which, may in fact, may make you a better asset to a new graduate med/surg unit than if you had only had med/surg preceptorship.   If you choose to do ED and go into medsurg for your first RN job - you will have developed a lot of useful skills that make you highly marketable for any area, such as: being adaptable/flexible to quick paced and/or stressful environments, working with 12 lead EKG, emergency care for stroke and heart attack patients, participation in codes using ACLS protocol, triage, IV starts, etc.   Do you see what I mean?

Your scores will yo-yo around per test based on the content.   -There are 4 sample tests accessible from the Q bank screen in the top left corner.

StudentNurse,39zmds,vigor145,3,Tue Jun 16 02:01:10 2015 UTC,"This comes directly from HESI:  ""Your HESI scores range from 0 to over 1,000, and can be as high as 1,500 (depending on the difficulty level of the exam). An acceptable level of performance is 850. However, the recommended level of performance is 900 and above for all scores provided.  Each school is responsible for establishing their specific standards related to outcome measures of acceptable scores. Many schools choose a certain overall score as a benchmark for progression, and such benchmarks are set at the discretion of the school’s faculty and administrators. However, when preparing for the NCLEX®, it is recommended that students seriously remediate any subject area category in which they obtained a score of less than 850.  All test items are weighted according to their difficulty level. If you answer more difficult items correctly, you will get more credit than if you answer less difficult test items correctly. Because of this scoring method, it is highly probable that two students answering the same number of test items correctly will receive different scores because such scores depend not only on how many test items the student answered correctly, but also on which test items the student answered correctly.  Your score reflects application of the HESI Predictability Model (HPM) to your overall score and each subject area score. Research studies have found the HPM to be highly accurate in predicting NCLEX® success.  Your conversion score is a weighted percentage score that considers the average difficulty of the exam and the average difficulty of the test items you answered. Based on your faculty’s use of this exam, the conversion score may be used as a portion of your course grade.  The HESI score is a better predictor of NCLEX® success than the conversion score because it reflects application of the HPM in its calculation, whereas the conversion score does not."""

StudentNurse,39yb4e,Vonnescott,3,Tue Jun 16 04:05:08 2015 UTC,I graduated May 1st and took my NCLEX May 28th. I can't imagine waiting till August.
StudentNurse,39yb4e,Rivers_On_Fire,3,Tue Jun 16 13:49:12 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear. I am currently working my arse off trying to save up to take my LPN boards before I go back to school at the end of August. I will be sending the ATT fee out the last week of June, so I am under the impression that I won't be testing this summer."
StudentNurse,39yb4e,FearAndLoafing,4,Tue Jun 16 02:08:37 2015 UTC,Our school took six weeks to submit our information.  It was a good time frame to study and review.
StudentNurse,39yb4e,digital_anomaly,0,Mon Jun 15 23:07:51 2015 UTC,Six weeks to prepare for that exam is far too long. Holy crap.
StudentNurse,39yb4e,nickiness,2,Tue Jun 16 03:02:08 2015 UTC,"Wow...ok, thanks for putting things in perspective! I think I wouldn't be as pissed if they told us, ""expect ATT in late June,  late July, late august, etc."" but they literally went out of their way to tell us they submit the same day we graduates. When you are expecting end of May or early June, only to find out that is far from the case, it gets frustrating. I feel like I'm studying with no end in sight. Plus I have a job lined up...which I've now had to delay 3 weeks more than expected...  I'm in PA :)"
StudentNurse,39yb4e,Pterasaur,2,Tue Jun 16 00:43:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm in the same boat, got hired as an RN and they asked how long untill I took the NCLEX when they heard august they also hired me as a tech untill I passed, just so I could work on the floor I would be an RN on."
StudentNurse,39yb4e,msega1988,2,Tue Jun 16 16:38:54 2015 UTC,"Damn! One of my friends just got his ATT (when we all got ours 3 weeks ago) (p.s I'm in Ontario Canada, so our system might be different). I know it can be frustrating but hang in there. Grab a pillow and have a good yell. Good luck!"
StudentNurse,39zk8q,TibbersTeaParty,2,Tue Jun 16 01:43:03 2015 UTC,"Link to another comment I made on passing Exit HESIs  To reiterate that info:  Review your PDF Reports from your previous Exit HESIs:    First, look to see where you are struggling (e.g. missed 9/20 cardiovascular questions, but got 18/20 respiratory questions correct).  Second, look to see if the tests are similar (my version 1 and version 2 Exit HESIs had nearly the exact same amount of questions in each content area, meaning, it showed that on version 1 there were 20 cardio, while only 9 gastrointestinal. So look to see where the test is weighed most heavily, and look to see if you are having trouble in the same areas each time you have taken the test.)    Take your 3 Evolve Practice Comprehensive Exams   125 questions each. Review the rationales thoroughly.    Edit: Side note: I mention in the link that Version 1 and Version 2 are very similar because I compared mine.. however, your HESIs could be different than mine... so do your own research, of course."
StudentNurse,39zk8q,destroyingtocreate,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:55:24 2015 UTC,"THIS. For even exam cram CDs and other test taking things, many will generate a report for you to tell you where you're scoring lowest. Stop reviewing all material and concentrate on where the HESI reports are telling you that you're struggling."
StudentNurse,39zk8q,dandelion_k,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:40:29 2015 UTC,"Read Saunders or Hogans Reviews and Rationales Med Surge!! Take notes. Do the Hurst review if you gots the money$$ or even Kaplan$$. I'd recommend Kaplan in hindsight. HESI is pure test taking ability. If you have evovle do every single case study, exam ,etc EVERYTHING. And look for patterns.  The thing that helped me pass was Saunders + Yourbestgrade.com + Evovle"
StudentNurse,39zk8q,lurknomoretoday,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:23:35 2015 UTC,"I second these comments. Also, Uworld offers a good 30 day trial.  I'd suggest getting a program like hurst, saunders or kaplan to study with for HESI..and then NCLEX. Best of luck!!"
StudentNurse,39zk8q,msega1988,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:10:18 2015 UTC,"Did you read through each question you got wrong?  I failed my first Exit HESI, and the second one was almost all the same questions.  I'm not sure if it's like that for everyone, but many of my peers had the same situation."

StudentNurse,39udry,HKkabanossi,3,Sat Jun 20 01:07:47 2015 UTC,"Congratulations, i got into one starting this fall as well. Something I've learnt form lurking in this subreddit is that you should never try to cut corners when it comes to shoes. Get some really good shoes, ones that are comfortable to wear for long periods of time and also resist fluids. This advice probably won't help a whole lot whilst you're studying but it definately will after you graduate."
StudentNurse,39udry,tansrn,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:03:37 2015 UTC,Thanks and congratulations to you as well! I have some dr schols (sp?) that seems to work pretty good I just need to buy some black ones now.

StudentNurse,39tc99,ButImAHomo,8,Sun Jun 14 16:04:12 2015 UTC,"What a bummer, especially when you did have jobs lined up. I would say just try to put it behind you and start new. I passed in 75 questions, and I used Kaplan, but I would definitely suggest purchasing the whole program with the Qtrainers and the online program. I found the class helped me to understand the ""rules of nclex land"" and the decision tree is amazing. Kaplan also sets up their interface just like the NCLEX , so when you test it all seems very familiar. I would say I agree with Ash_ash, in that I found that Kaplan was harder than the test too. When taking their tests and I found I was weak in an area (getting less than 60%) I used the content review videos and ebook to help me beef up. Another big tip I would have would be to get a notebook and when you do questions and you don't understand the disease process or the med...write that in your notebook and review your notes every couple days.  I know some people who used http://www.uworld.com/home.aspx  for SATA question practice.  Wish you the best!!"
StudentNurse,39tc99,msega1988,2,Sun Jun 14 19:03:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips. I just can't afford the full course.
StudentNurse,39tc99,msega1988,3,Sun Jun 14 20:09:35 2015 UTC,"That makes sense it is really pricey. As far as the course goes, there are some posters you can google that explain the tree a bit that may be helpful in those what would you do first questions. And I just talked to a friend who said that uworld has a free 30 day subscription going on and that the rationales were more comprehensive."
StudentNurse,39tc99,Xero1Three,2,Sun Jun 14 20:20:38 2015 UTC,Thank you. :)
StudentNurse,39tc99,SirLafayette,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:25:11 2015 UTC,I passed with 265 questions I used uworld qbank and I had the hurst review book to go through.
StudentNurse,39tc99,Ash_ash,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:45:31 2015 UTC,Hi I'm a LVN student who is about to graduate and was wondering if there was something similar to uworld but for LVNs?  Thanks!
StudentNurse,39tc99,tvw0911,3,Mon Jun 15 04:29:05 2015 UTC,"I used Kaplans program and studied for 2 months before taking the test and passed in 75. I found it really helpful and the questions were exactly like the NCLEX, actually I found the Kaplan questions harder than the actual test! Which was really helpful once I learned how to answer the questions the way nclex wants you to."
StudentNurse,39tc99,raspberry_blue_,5,Sun Jun 14 16:38:12 2015 UTC,"I think that's the most important part,  getting to the point where you can understand how to answer the questions correctly. It's like a science.  There's usually a distraction, a right answer that doesn't answer the question,  and then an incomplete answer and the actual right answer.  Once you can fig that out the test should become so much easier."
StudentNurse,39tc99,raspberry_blue_,3,Sun Jun 14 17:06:33 2015 UTC,"First off, how did you study before?"
StudentNurse,39tc99,sum1rand0m,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:32:20 2015 UTC,MY school offered a 3 day live review right before graduation. I attended that as well at used the Saunder's review book and CD with questions. I did 60-70% on the Saunder's practice tests.
StudentNurse,39tc99,usfdude223,3,Mon Jun 15 03:09:01 2015 UTC,"So you only did the review class and Saunders? Even though you probably think you studied a lot, you need to study more. I agree with others that if you can't afford Kaplan, look up the decision tree and youtube kaplan videos to see if you can find anything. It's really helpful. Did you go over all the content in Saunders? It's good to go over all the systems briefly and then focus on your weak areas and go more in depth with those.   Ask your professors for help, ask your classmates, and practice, practice, practice! Study everyday. My professor recommends 6 hours per day of studying. Do as close to that as you can without driving yourself crazy. This is your job right now. Studying has become your full time job."
StudentNurse,39tc99,nt2014,-1,Mon Jun 15 03:15:44 2015 UTC,"Content wise, I felt prepared other than the meds. The recent change to only generic names on the test screwed me over, and of course, it was the most obscure drugs on the planet. So no, I did not cover all content in saunders."
StudentNurse,39tc99,annastar,2,Mon Jun 15 03:22:16 2015 UTC,If you were weak on content NCSBN is good. A lot of topics but very concise. I am also taking the Hurst online review. Also good for content but with videos if you are into that.
StudentNurse,39tc99,aithril,2,Sun Jun 14 22:31:52 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, I took the NCSBN and it's a monstrous amount of information in 5 weeks, I would suggest one or the other, not both."
StudentNurse,39s8zf,Nationofnoobs,3,Sun Jun 14 06:49:45 2015 UTC,You can do it!!!!
StudentNurse,39s8zf,raspberry_blue_,3,Sun Jun 14 09:38:35 2015 UTC,I'm feeling the exact same way!
StudentNurse,39s8zf,tjh28,2,Sun Jun 14 13:29:42 2015 UTC,I'm June 22 @ 0800. I agree. However we're gonna do it and we're gonna pass!

StudentNurse,39t9ah,IamTalking,5,Sun Jun 14 15:36:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, you passed."
StudentNurse,39t9ah,salmonhead,2,Sun Jun 14 16:06:08 2015 UTC,Hope so!!! I just heard PVT was less accurate recently so I wasn't sure.
StudentNurse,39t9ah,Beardus_Maximus,6,Sun Jun 14 16:12:32 2015 UTC,"I took it May 28th. 89 questions. I knew I had done well (because I got so many runs of multiple-multiples), but I was still nervous. I did the Pearson trick probably every hour for 48 hours (minus sleeping of course) until 8am two days later, when I got to purchase my early results. The trick has worked for EVERY person in my nursing class (around 50) and it attempted to run the card last week of a friend who failed. I thought I was the one person the trick messed up on (even though I knew I had done well), so I understand what you're going through. Longest 48 hours of my life! Congrats, and post again here when you get your ""official"" results tomorrow!"
StudentNurse,39t9ah,honeyboo311,6,Sun Jun 14 16:18:04 2015 UTC,What is a multiple multiple?
StudentNurse,39t9ah,Beardus_Maximus,2,Sun Jun 14 20:22:49 2015 UTC,"Select all that apply. They are the ""top tier"" of nclex questions, so if you get a bunch of those, you're probably doing well."
StudentNurse,39t9ah,Airyk21,5,Sun Jun 14 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much! That definitely helps. Can't wait for my quick results tomorrow morning. Believe it or not I actually got my ATT Friday night at 6pm, and saw there was an opening to test the next morning at 8am (literally 14 hours later). I said fuck it and signed up to get it over with. The next test date wasn't until mid-july so if I fail I can restest end of July. So glad this is (hopefully) all over with!"
StudentNurse,39t9ah,honeyboo311,4,Sun Jun 14 16:25:12 2015 UTC,I love how even Pearson Vue Trick has an acronym now. Long live the PVT!
StudentNurse,39t9ah,tvw0911,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:45:00 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on this???
StudentNurse,39t9ah,salmonhead,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:14:50 2015 UTC,"I shall refer you to this response, from /u/Airyk21.  If you have already passed NCLEX, you cannot register to retake the test. You can use this undocumented feature to see if you've passed almost immediately after the exam."
StudentNurse,39t9ah,nsnurse,2,Wed Jun 17 01:40:30 2015 UTC,I feel like some sort of expert or celebrity having my posts referenced. Thank you /u/Bearded_Maximus .
StudentNurse,39r2vx,KittyKiashi,15,Sat Jun 13 22:48:15 2015 UTC,I will never ever forget what Nystatin is. That's what my son and I were prescribed when he had thrush in his mouth and I had thrush in both breasts. :( Nothing like a little trauma to help you remember.
StudentNurse,39r2vx,Kappa_the_imp,3,Sun Jun 14 00:27:05 2015 UTC,":( I'm sorry that you had to go though that.  At least a little something good came out of that?   When I was doing the school nurse rotation, my nurse was telling me that she might have to get a cardiac cath.  She told me that if that were the case, she'd let me come and observe.  I said ""thanks, that'll be cool."" and she responded with ""yeah, cool FOR YOU.""  She was being fun about it and knew what I meant by it but I always think about that when there's a good situation/bad situation.  If you don't mind me asking, you had thrush inside of your breast milk? (you don't have to answer if you don't want to)."
StudentNurse,39r2vx,Kappa_the_imp,3,Sun Jun 14 03:16:52 2015 UTC,"I like your attitude. You're alright. And yep, as it turns out, yeast LOVES breastmilk. Lots of sugar in there. I had to ditch all of my pumped milk, and get the baby treated at the same time so we wouldn't pass it back and forth. It was itchy and painful and awful. It was probably the worst breastfeeding related thing that happened to me, and my son is a biter, to give you a point of reference for awful things that happened while I was breastfeeding. :|"
StudentNurse,39r2vx,Kappa_the_imp,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:53:49 2015 UTC,"That sounds awful!  How long did the treatment take?  Did you have to give up breastfeeding for good? Did you have another child after this son?  I'm a long time away from having a child myself but I pretty much have my mind made up on breastfeeding.  Motherhood is filled with surprises, good ones and not so good ones :/ Here's to a happy and healthy life for you and your family."
StudentNurse,39r2vx,phagocytic,2,Sun Jun 14 16:23:59 2015 UTC,"I think maybe two weeks? This was when he was around two months old, he's almost two now, so I don't remember exactly how long, sorry! And nope, we did not give up breastfeeding. Still going, as a matter of fact. And no more babies for me, at least until I graduate. Homework with a toddler is a nightmare! It was way easier when he was a sweet little newborn that slept all day... Thanks for the well wishes, we're doing great! Being a mom is pretty cool though, I'd do it again, even with foreknowledge about thrush. :|   Good luck to you and yours as well! :)"

StudentNurse,39r2vx,BVsaPike,4,Sat Jun 13 23:26:15 2015 UTC,"My fun sorry with nystatin: On my exit exam I got a question that asked if nystatin was an: antifungal, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, or antiparasitic. I was 90 percent sure it was antifungal but the little voice in my head was like, ""remember that time you put nystatin powder on those sores after cleaning out the yeast growth. Yeast is a bacteria, it's got to be an antibiotic"" so I second guessed myself and went with the wrong answer."
StudentNurse,39r2vx,Methodicalist,7,Sun Jun 14 04:55:46 2015 UTC,"Yeast is a bacteria,    ¿Cómo?"
StudentNurse,39r2vx,BVsaPike,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:56:48 2015 UTC,It's not a bacteria but my brain was thinking that it was for some reason.

StudentNurse,39r2vx,CCCP85,3,Mon Jun 15 10:52:30 2015 UTC,Oh I hate it when I second guess myself and then get it wrong!  But now you'll never forget right?   And I think yeast is a fungus.
StudentNurse,39r2vx,lurknomoretoday,2,Sun Jun 14 16:25:54 2015 UTC,"It is a fungus, sorry I didn't clarify my thoughts more, but I was thinking it was a bacteria even though I was sure nystatin was an antifungal so I convinced myself that nystatin was an antibiotic instead of an antifungal because I was thinking that yeast was a bacteria, which it isn't."
StudentNurse,39siwk,CCCP85,3,Sun Jun 14 09:45:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I bombed that twice. I also bombed the delegation hesi too because I worked in a hospital.

StudentNurse,39siwk,KittyKiashi,2,Mon Jun 15 00:17:06 2015 UTC,"I actually did better on my Psych HESI than any other HESI I had. But I always liked Psych and I felt that our instructor really knew how to teach the material.    What is ""failing"" anyway? Less than 850?   I wouldn't put a whole lot of emphasis on psych, peds, maternal, or pharm HESI scores. Do well on your med-surg, and get ready for your HESI comprehensive exams - I think those are the ones that really matter and will help determine preparedness for the NCLEX-RN."

StudentNurse,39rlub,aislinnanne,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:52:10 2015 UTC,"Not at all. Being ready for the NCLEX and getting your nursing license is what nursing school is all about, after all. I had a really hard time motivating myself to study for it because I felt ready. Worked out for me in the end, but you know yourself better than anyone else here so if you did well in school, are a good test taker, and aren't fooling yourself then you're ready if you feel like it."
StudentNurse,39rlub,EbagI,2,Sun Jun 14 03:26:18 2015 UTC,Oh I know what you mean. Now that I feel ready motivation is tough. But I made a study schedule and I'm determined to stick to it!

I attempted to take it in the summer once while working full time- I ended up dropping the class, it's a lot of material to take in over the summer.  The most important thing is to do what you need to do to do well in these courses to get into the program."
StudentNurse,39mgza,annastar,6,Fri Jun 12 20:09:31 2015 UTC,"Relax, lady bug! Slow down! You have plenty of time to go to nursing school! Don't put so much pressure on yourself. 4 weeks to take a class that is tough over 16 weeks would be hard no matter who you are. And from my experience, nursing school was way harder than A&P I or II (not to scare you, but it's the honest truth) as in nursing school you are taking a couple hard classes at a time that all demand a lot of your time and attention (I went to a 3 year BSN/MSN program, so I can't speak about the 2 year program, but I imagine they are similar). I think I can understand feeling like a failure, because I tell myself the same things during similar situations. But you are not a failure at all, friend. Perhaps you are also feeling disappointed about waiting another year before you can apply? Ultimately, it sounds like you did the right thing for yourself, and your future patients, to take it in the fall. Have a great summer, and be ready to be a huge success come August!! :-)"
StudentNurse,39mgza,throwmethebunny,6,Fri Jun 12 22:46:59 2015 UTC,"Currently studying for NCLEX BUT I figured I'd share:  Took me about, oh, 6 years to get to this point.  Took A&P 1 and 2, chemistry 3 times (3rd time was the charm), micro, Spanish, nutrition, and maybe even some others I am forgetting.  Point is, who cares how long it takes as long as you get there.  Seriously, I did one prerequisite at a time, and as horrible as I thought that was, at no point did I ever think of giving up.    Tl;dr: don't feel like a failure, space it out, get good grades, kick ass, TRY to enjoy these classes (I personally loved micro), take your time, and just keep on going.  You can do it.  PS sorry this post reads like a schizophrenic wrote it, my brain is fried."
StudentNurse,39mgza,salmonhead,7,Fri Jun 12 20:10:18 2015 UTC,"4 weeks is ridiculously short for A&P I. I had 30 weeks to do mine, and I took about 25, though I was working full time and doing it online. 16 weeks for an in class version sounds much more realistic.   Like others have said, don't stress it, do well in the pre-req courses, understand the material (don't just study for a test), and you'll do much better in the long run. Realistically, even if you don't meet your goals (which seem reasonable), worst case scenario you end up delaying your start, which isn't the end of the world. It will give you more time to save to pay for school, get some life experience, and let the stuff you learn in your courses really sink in."
StudentNurse,39mgza,SillySafetyGirl,6,Fri Jun 12 20:18:54 2015 UTC,"If anything, take micro over the summer (next summer). A&P is a lot harder than micro, in my opinion, which is why you should take A&P 1 and 2 slowly (as in a full semester each, not condensed). Maybe try taking micro next summer after completing A&P 1 and 2?  Also, don't compare yourself to ANYONE else. There will always be someone smarter than you, someone who aces all the tests, someone doing just a little bit better. You have to block them out and focus on yourself, because you are doing all you can! And they don't matter. So take a deep breath. I'm still working on this mindset myself, by the way! :)  Believe in yourself~"
StudentNurse,39mgza,mcslootysloot,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:30:29 2015 UTC,"A&P is a lot harder than micro, in my opinion,    Really it was the opposite for me."
StudentNurse,39mgza,lovelyone20,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:32:05 2015 UTC,I think it was easier for me because I took it over the summer at a community college instead of my university.
StudentNurse,39mgza,mcslootysloot,3,Sun Jun 14 14:20:03 2015 UTC,uh holy shit! I took A&P broken down into two classes over two semesters and it was awful. How is four weeks even possible?
StudentNurse,39mgza,ApolloIV,2,Fri Jun 12 20:58:29 2015 UTC,"I took A&P 1&2 last summer at my university, and it was BRUTAL. We had six weeks for each course and even that was not enough. Even my professor said he believes it's cruel and unusual to have this class over the summer because it's simply too much info to take in and really LEARN. We ended up skipping over a few things because we had no other choice..we had to skip the digestive system almost entirely but thankfully I had already taken multiple nutrition classes so I didn't feel like I missed out, but I think it's not so good to skip over a major system for people who are going to become nurses. I ended up retaing AP1 again in the fall because I got a C+ taking AP1 over the summer, and at my school you need a B. It was SO much better the second time --i mean, of course it's easier seeing anything the second time around, but I really feel like the second time around I had more time to actually LEARN the material instead of just memorize it for a test"
StudentNurse,39mgza,superpony123,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:42:21 2015 UTC,"GI is easy- food goes in, poop comes out. You can't explain that!  Seriously though, I can't imagine that. I can honestly say A&P I and II were the hardest classes for my entire degree."
StudentNurse,39mgza,ApolloIV,2,Fri Jun 19 03:21:50 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but this professor teaches in EXTREME detail. Which, yeah, is great because you learn a LOT but given the extent to which he taught every other system, I would have expected to know quite a lot about digestion (but, I already do, because I took an entire 3cred class on digestion alone..so there's that). I go to a pretty large state school with  a highly ranked nursing program but he is the only one that teaches this course here, he's been doing it for a veeeery long time and our nursing school LOVES this man (and heck, I do too, even though that course was tough) because he really does weed out the students who don't have the study habits and skills you need to get through nursing school.   There were a lot of times where I was constantly asking myself in that class ""do I REALLY need to know this? UGH!"" when I got frustrated studying a lot of detailed stuff. Am I going to need to memorize all the origins and insertions and actions of EVERY muscle in the body in my career? Probably not, but I've actually found a lot of the stuff I've learned in that class to be extremely practical (that's at least in part because I'm a weight lifter though..but still!) and so I'm not upset. Knowledge is power right?"
StudentNurse,39mgza,superpony123,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:13:49 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, the more you retain from A&P the more it helps later on. I worked hard throughout my schooling but I feel like I frontloaded things by putting in an extreme amount of effort in those two, which paid dividends later on when I could just reason through disease processes/patho instead of memorizing. I had a similar very detail oriented professor who was amazing, so I know what you mean."
StudentNurse,39mgza,ApolloIV,2,Fri Jun 19 05:46:55 2015 UTC,"Do not feel bad at all about dropping A&P. I tried it over summer and almost flunked it so I dropped it and then did fine when I took it over a semester. On top of that, I'm in an accelerated nursing program that moves rather quickly and I have zero problems keeping up. Don't let people make you feel down. People all learn differently and have different strengths. Something that worked for one person might not work for another."
StudentNurse,39mgza,Sunflowerslove,2,Fri Jun 12 20:19:45 2015 UTC,"I took A&P II and Micro this past quarter along with 3 other general classes. I was terrified but I ended up doing well in both. It is definitely doable, you would just need to be ready to really buckle down and study.   Don't feel like a failure, A&P is already a difficult subject on it's own without it being condensed down to 4 weeks. Good luck OP!"
StudentNurse,39mgza,missneyney,2,Fri Jun 12 23:42:00 2015 UTC,4 weeks for A&P sounds awful and I can't see it preparing you very well.  Better to have a more solid foundation going in.  It's ok to take your time while you still can and absorb the material better.  Forget what that person told you and don't let anyone including yourself put you down for it.
StudentNurse,39mgza,doctor_hooha,2,Sat Jun 13 00:36:00 2015 UTC,"A&P over the summer would suck, A&P sucks over a normal semester, dont worry about it, this just means you will be better off when you re-take it.   ""Someone told me that summer A&P course was something like nursing school and it'll determine how well you do in nursing school. "" That may be true because you go over lots of material in nursing school quickly but that's crazy.   Look at your schedule make a plan and work the plan, you will do fine. Take a breath and make sure that your not exhausted before you even get into nursing school."
StudentNurse,39mgza,DanKC,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:34:16 2015 UTC,Are you saying that A&P in general determines how well you'd do in nursing school? Aside from summer.
StudentNurse,39mgza,DanKC,3,Sun Jun 14 04:35:09 2015 UTC,"No I think they are different, nursing school is about so much more than the memorization that is required in a A&P course.  I was saying the only correlation between the two is that in a summer course you go over alot of info quickly like the rest of nursing school."
StudentNurse,39mgza,CCCP85,2,Sun Jun 14 14:32:40 2015 UTC,"I would say no. What A&P does is give you a foundation to build on when you are in nursing school. Many times it is expected that you already know things like the RAAS system; or how the chemichal processes (metabolism, catabolism) work, and what the biproducts are like keytones, how they influence the pH level of the body. They will not be reteaching these things so if you learn them well now you will do much better."
StudentNurse,39mgza,CCCP85,2,Sun Jun 14 09:37:45 2015 UTC,"Like everyone already said, give yourself a bit of a break and take that weight off your back. You are not a failure, many of us dropped classes and had to delay applying. It took me around 5 years to finish pre-req's and started nursing school when I was 28.  The only thing I would mention is to use ""Rate my proffesor"" while in pre-reqs, but get used to not liking all of your instructors when you start nursing school."
StudentNurse,39mgza,ladynightlife,2,Sun Jun 14 09:28:37 2015 UTC,how the fuck does anyone successfully complete A&P in 4 weeks? I took 2 weeks just on 1/6 of my course. I'm hoping to speed up now that I'm in more familiar/easy territory (aka out of the biochemistry/cellular stuff) but dear god. I can't imagine stuffing an entire 4 credit course into 4 weeks unless I just sat around doing it all day every day.
StudentNurse,39mgza,CCCP85,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:02:51 2015 UTC,My coworker completed A&P II in four weeks and pulled an A. So I really have no fucking clue how she did that.  That is originally what made me feel shitty. haha.
StudentNurse,39mgza,420N0SCOPE_BlaZEiT,2,Sun Jun 14 20:09:03 2015 UTC,"You have to wonder how much they actually retained though. I know that people learn differently and there's some that can probably pull it out in 4 weeks and be able to recall info later on. For me, I would not be able to actually retian the information, especially since A&P requires so much memorization."
StudentNurse,39jdmf,katsandtea,3,Fri Jun 12 03:23:06 2015 UTC,"What you are experiencing sounds about normal.  A year ago I could have written almost the exact same thing as you did.  I made it through a 12 month program and it was very tough.  We lost a lot of people along the way.  After Med/Surg was done the loss of class mates slowed down.  Find or make your own study group.  It is a life saver.  Sometimes just hearing someone else discuss a topic or teaching someone something will make it stick.    When it came to test I had to constantly tell myself to slow down.  I also made a habit of not only picking the correct answer, but eliminating others to confirm my decision.  It slowed me down and kept me from making dumb mistakes on tests.    It was one of the most stressful years of my life but it can be done.     After each block of finals I would take a day or two for myself to do nothing school related.  It is a good decompression.  Then i would do a little pre reading and try to get a little ahead before classes started again.  If you stay on top of things and keep organized it will help in the long run.  Good luck, it will be over before you know it."
StudentNurse,39jdmf,manimel,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:33:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you!- yea, I've had to get in the habit of slowing down already. I'm so used to going for the ""right"" answer immediately when taking tests but clearly with nursing tests, a couple answers can seem to be right at first glance.  Three weeks in and I already feel like I've spent a year here!"
StudentNurse,39jdmf,Sunflowerslove,2,Wed Jun 17 01:15:12 2015 UTC,"I'm into my second term of a three term accelerated program, and really, a week isn't complete unless you've cried at least once. You just have to keep reminding yourself that you'll make it. Whenever I feel down about classes, I just think about all the other people who have passed that class in my program and then I feel better.   What kind of study habits do you have? Do you have any Success or Reviews and Rationales books? Those two are my favorites as far as practicing questions go. And honestly, the more tests you take, the better they get. You'll start to get the hang of nursing style questions. If I don't know the answer to a question, I'll go through ABC and/or Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. I also just write out why a choice is wrong. We always get scratch paper for our exams, and I've turned in a paper before after the exam that was completely full of scribbles and notes about different questions. For me, it helps to write things out so I can think about it."
StudentNurse,39jdmf,Sunflowerslove,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:56:10 2015 UTC,"Okay! At least I don't feel like we're all so crazy crying during class anymore.. haha. Ours is a three term program too, so if I live, I'll be done in April  All of our textbooks so far have been Elsevier, so I've been using their online study guide methods and have just been doing the review questions over and over again. But one of the other students got a Success NCLEX book and the chapter it had for pharmacology was so great, I might consider picking one up for myself.  We don't get any scratch paper but we can write on the exams so that's okay. Our first class has been pretty straight forward - she tells us exactly what to study for the exams so I feel pretty confidant about that class. Pharmacology on the other hand is killing me. Byeaaahh. My study process so far has been to read and take notes for each chapter, make index cards on quizlet, do the study guide and chapter questions and then go back to the study cards until I have them down."
StudentNurse,39jdmf,wsgaston,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:34:23 2015 UTC,"The success books are my favorite! I've already sold all my ones from last semester, but I have some on pdfs if you want them. They're just Med-Surg, Psych, and OB so you probably won't need them yet, but you could probably Google the PDFs for Fundamentals, Health Assessment, Patho, and Pharm, those we're my classes for first term but yours are probably different. We found that going through them helped a lot and our teachers were actually pulling a lot of questions from there.   Elsevier is pretty good. That's what we use, too and I've found it pretty helpful.   Pharm is just a nightmare of a class. I know one girl who liked it in my cohort. Just stay as positive as you can though. That's really what's helped me and not comparing myself to others. I used to get worked up about others doing better than me on exams, but now I just do what I have to do and get excited that I'm passing exams haha. The freaking out feeling doesn't pass. I have an OB exam in like two hours and everyone is in panic mode and that's just how it is before every exam haha. Eventually things will start clicking though and what you're doing will make more sense.   Med Surg isn't that bad either. I found pharm way worse. I just started Med Surg a month ago, but I actually enjoy it and find it easier to apply to what I'm doing."
StudentNurse,39jdmf,Sunflowerslove,2,Fri Jun 12 15:42:43 2015 UTC,"I'm applying to some programs now and have heard this about one of the schools, Drexel University. Where do you guys go, so I can beware."
StudentNurse,39jdmf,rirry,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:13:15 2015 UTC,"I go to Goldfarb in Missouri, but I don't think it's that bad and it's an accelerated program. They try really hard to work with us and we only had one person from my cohort have to retake a class after first semester. It's the same for terms above me, just 1-3 students a semester. For the most part, every school is going to have bad and good things though."
StudentNurse,39jdmf,rirry,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:01:58 2015 UTC,"Hey! Take a deep breath!  I was in an ABSN program.  I had a nervous breakdown every other semester and cried very, very frequently.  I failed medsurg 1 and pharmacology 2.  I came back and kicked ass and made it through.  I've got a ridiculous amount of student loans and I have a lot of good friends that couldn't make it through the program.  But you know what made everything okay?  Passing my NCLEX.  Nursing school is rough.  Definitely.  But it's important to always remember why you're putting yourself through that hell and think about all the people who appreciate you at clinical.  As far as learning nothing at lectures - BEEN THERE!  What helped me the most was a number of things.  First, reading the chapters before the lecture.  I always fell behind so I didn't do this often, but when I did it really helped.  Repetition also helped when I was taking my notes.  I'd write them out on powerpoints and copy them into a notebook and then again onto flow charts.  If I missed anything I listened to my recordings from the lectures (which I still have saved!).  Also, I used different colored pens for each topic so my notes didn't blend together.  I met with my professors almost weekly for reviews and I frequented our tutoring center as well.  My social life was a joke, I went through serious 2 boyfriends, and I spent a TON of time on reddit.  But hey!  I got through it!  It's hard, but doable.  Good luck! :)"
StudentNurse,39h7dc,ApolloIV,3,Thu Jun 11 18:16:19 2015 UTC,Been there done that.  Take this time to finalize your resume and browse through jobs to know what is available. Do you have quick results in your state?
StudentNurse,39h7dc,BroomfieldMom,2,Thu Jun 11 18:22:24 2015 UTC,"I do, but it says they're not available yet. Most of my classmates seem to have had a one day turnaround on their results, but I think the hold thing might drag mine out. On the jobs front I actually have a job lined up and waiting for me that I'll be starting on the 22nd..if I pass."
StudentNurse,39h7dc,samzaz,3,Thu Jun 11 18:24:44 2015 UTC,"I finished yesterday at 75 too! I bet you passed and will have your results when they see that there was no funny business that occurred.

StudentNurse,39h7dc,adickman18,2,Thu Jun 11 21:38:44 2015 UTC,"Best of luck!  I will be in the same boat next week.  And my state (Virginia) does not participate in quick results.    Did you use Kaplan or Hurst or something similar?  After graduation, how long did you study for?  I took a few weeks off and then did Kaplan and am continuing with Kaplan and books until next week."
StudentNurse,39h7dc,adickman18,2,Thu Jun 11 18:47:40 2015 UTC,"I did Kaplan, and basically did 150~ practice questions a day most every day. I graduated May 9th and tested yesterday, so I did have four weeks to study. The first week after graduation was just me attending the actual Kaplan class though, not actually studying per se."
StudentNurse,39h7dc,salmonhead,2,Thu Jun 11 18:55:19 2015 UTC,I finished yesterday at 75 and I'm slowly dying. I just hate the suspense.

StudentNurse,39h7dc,salmonhead,2,Fri Jun 12 00:26:41 2015 UTC,"I actually paid for the class and everything so I had access to the full Qbank. I would recommend it, if you do most of them you get much more familiar and comfortable with NCLEX style questions. The class and decision tree were a little helpful but not the amazing thing they make it out to be- it's really the study resources they provide you with that are helpful."

StudentNurse,39blxc,tessln26,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:33:23 2015 UTC,"This is so reassuring.  That's roughly my average, and kaplan is the only test prep I'm doing."
StudentNurse,39blxc,mcnew,2,Wed Jun 10 18:57:50 2015 UTC,"How did you average your scores for Kaplan?  Like, did you add all of the Question Trainer scores, the Readiness and Assessment scores, the QBank scores?  Or is it just important to count Question Trainer 6 & 7 and the QBank test scores with 75 or more questions?"
StudentNurse,39blxc,salmonhead,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:14:41 2015 UTC,"I am looking at my averages for each area actually. For the Q bank questions, you can check your average of all the exams  you took, and mine was around a 61%. We were told in the review class to score around a 60% on the diagnostic test. It says in the first few pages of the book that for Q trainers 4&5 to get around a 65% (they're easier questions I guess) and to get around a 60% on Q trainers 6&7.  SO really overall, I was about a 60% for everything."
StudentNurse,39blxc,tessln26,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:24:49 2015 UTC,Does it give you your QBank average after you've done every single question?  I can't find where it averages everything.  And thank you and congrats again!  PS How similar is NCLEX to Kaplan?  Thank you!
StudentNurse,39blxc,salmonhead,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:48:11 2015 UTC,"Go to NCLEX PREP, Qbank, and on the left handed toolbar, go to cumulative performance and it will give your overall performance. You don't have to do every question to get your average! and they were very, very similar!"
StudentNurse,39blxc,tessln26,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:37:54 2015 UTC,"I guess more of an unofficial average, I've gotten ~60-70% on pretty much everything. I'm doing Qbank stuff right now."
StudentNurse,39blxc,mcnew,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:00:08 2015 UTC,We were given a hard copy of the book and it said on the first few pages you should score around a 60% on your practice exams. It really does prepare you!

StudentNurse,39blxc,salmonhead,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:24:32 2015 UTC,"The Kaplan review course gives you literally 2,000+ questions and I did every single one and that is what I feel best prepared me.

I tried a quick google search but the information I found was very vague.  I plan to start studying/ thinking about NCLEX when I have a school break in August, to take it in December or January, would just kind of like a heads up now."
StudentNurse,39blxc,msiri,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:24:23 2015 UTC,"Passing in 75 or more questions means the computer has determined with 95% accuracy that you are well above competency level and there is no need for you to go on. The computer won't start the scoring until you finish the 75th question.  Passing with the maximum 265 questions means you were either slightly above the minimum competency, slightly below, or exactly at the minimum competency level. If your very last question was at or above the minimum competency level, you passed."
StudentNurse,39blxc,msiri,2,Thu Jun 11 00:25:32 2015 UTC,"So if I understand this correctly, if it only takes you 75 questions to finish, you know that you passed as soon as you finish, and don't need to stress while waiting for your score?"
StudentNurse,39blxc,ApolloIV,5,Thu Jun 11 00:44:55 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Keep in mind that the test shuts off when it's calculated confidently that you've passed or that you've failed. From my understanding, shutting off at 75 means that at that point you've either been doing very well or very badly.  Source: Nervous nurse whose NCLEX shut off at 75 today   edit: Also, a longer test means you're basically dancing up and down over the line of passing and the computer hasn't made up it's mind yet. If it gets to 265 and it's still undecided, the computer says ""fuck it"" and just decides based on the level of your last question."

StudentNurse,39buvn,Pumpkin214,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:48:01 2015 UTC,"I had adaptive quizzing through Elsevier, so on another program it may vary. But when you get into the EAQ, you can select chapters to include in the quiz. There's usually a systems chapter and an accompanying disorders chapter (for endocrine it is chapters 48 and 50, but they're usually in very close proximity to each other for other systems). Then you can choose how many questions you want and take the quiz."

StudentNurse,39c46m,salmonhead,8,Wed Jun 10 19:37:04 2015 UTC,I spent three weeks studying for the NCLEX and I exclusively spent my time doing Qbank questions. My average scores were anywhere from 54-65%. I was really nervous taking the test and I passed with 75 questions. Focus on the decision tree and test strategies because they work!
StudentNurse,39c46m,TheDouglas,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:33:38 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you!  And congrats!!!"
StudentNurse,39c46m,clinkingglasses,4,Thu Jun 11 14:28:40 2015 UTC,According to my professor if you get above 60% (or 65% can't remember) on Question Trainer tests 6&7 that means you're ready to test and have a high likelihood of passing.  As for the QBanks look at the cumulative performance tab and all your client need categories should be in the 60% or above.
StudentNurse,39c46m,MaroonKiwi,5,Wed Jun 10 19:46:29 2015 UTC,"Kaplan's job is to make sure that you pass. Their questions are often harder than the NCLEX in terms of content. They are useful to gauge what you need to review and to help iron the decision tree into your brain. Know their test-taking strategies and make sure that you understand the content.   Also, like other posters here mentioned, anything over a 60% is good, anything over a 65% is excellent."

StudentNurse,397xhv,quiet_alacrity,5,Tue Jun 9 22:14:09 2015 UTC,"Not a thing. Relax and enjoy the day. Get plenty of sleep. You know what you know.  My strategy was to relax the day before then on the day wake without an alarm (I scheduled my test for the afternoon). When I went into take the nclex, I focused on doing my best on the first 75 questions and if it made me go longer, I planned to sprint through the rest. Luckily, my computer went blank when I submitted the 75th answer. I left there and went straight to a bar and got drunk. Don't bother paying to see your results early. Just keep refreshing the state board of nursing website until you see your name.  You will see some random stuff on the test I have yet to encounter in 5 years in a medical ICU. Just refer to your pathophysiology. Just remember that even the stupidest nurse passed the nclex. I'm sure you encountered several of them in your clinical rotations.  Relax. You'll do fine."

Don't freak out over what you don't know, just read and soak up your lessons and you'll amaze yourself in a few semesters. Our failure rates in our school aren't as high as yours but it is still terrifying to know these damn ATI tests can kill us. Read your ATI books every day!"

StudentNurse,397by2,SqueezeTheShamansTit,6,Tue Jun 9 21:47:07 2015 UTC,"Just like high school, there is a LOT in nursing school that you aren't going to remember a year after you graduate. Don't get yourself down because you don't feel like you remember material.   Most nursing schools have horrible attrition rates. What you need to look at is NCLEX pass rates, because that is the percentage that will matter in the end. From the start to the end of my LPN, we lost about 35% of the class in one year. By the time we graduated with our RN/ADN, it was closer to 60%. But our pass rate for the NCLEX was 98%.   All you have to do is pass. Nursing school and nursing life are nothing alike. Nursing has it's own stress, absolutely, but it's not like school stress - and even if you decided you couldn't do bedside nursing because of the stress, there are plenty of other things you can do in nursing. Don't let school hold you back if this is what you want. You can do this."
StudentNurse,397by2,dandelion_k,4,Tue Jun 9 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"breathe.....the real world of nursing is NOTHING like what they make you think it is, and being stressed in school doesn't mean you wont be a great nurse.  You'll still be stressed, but you'll be surrounded by experienced nurses who are there to help you."
StudentNurse,397by2,NewtonsFig,3,Tue Jun 9 20:21:35 2015 UTC,"When I went to school, we thought the first semester was hard. Health assessment, fundamentals, nursing care of adults 1 and professional nursing practice. We only went to a clinical site twice during that sememster and I hated it. All class room, all book work. Terrible. I actually got a 67% on one of my clinical paperwork writeups on my patient. Then second semester came along with care of adults 2, geriatrics, psych and two 12 hr clinicals a week. And I thought 1st semester was hard... psych is my least favorite subject and geriatrics is pretty boring. But at least during this semester I got a flow going and learn what youre doing. By the time peds in 3rd and critical care in 4th rolled around, you know what youre doing for the most part. As for the ATI modules, read the books. They helped the most with the ATI assessments. I didn't get level 3s on everything but I never got a level 1. Working as a nurse can sometimes be stressful, but you will be taught more by the unit you go to work in. I (foolishly) thought  I was done with classes when I graduated. Come to find out I had to take ACLS, Impella, Balloon Pump, Hypothermia Therapy and many more classes through my unit to be able to do everything required to work there. Grit and get through it. And study your ass of in the mean time."

I'm in Canada, and while the program is challenging, it's unheard of for someone to have a mental breakdown and feel belittled.   All RNs here must go through a bachelors program (there's no associate degrees of nursing), and what I was told by one of the instructors is that the first 2 years is basically the equivalent of the American associate's degree, where you learn all the basic skills and theory, while the last year is on ""specialties"" like community, research, mental health etc. So really, we're still learning the same stuff in the same amount of time. What's the difference then?"
StudentNurse,397by2,Stagione,2,Wed Jun 10 05:16:22 2015 UTC,"I've never received an associates degree, only a bachelors degree so I can't really say.  From what I understand, an associate's degree RN is basically the same stuff that a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, RN (BSN) takes without all the GE requirements of a bachelors.  I already had a bachelors degree so all I had to do was take a few pre-requisite classes and then apply to the BSN program.  Most American bachelors degree's work as thus:    Year 1 and 2: work on general education requirements - science, math, english, etc.  Year 3 and 4: work on your degree requirements and any extra general education requirements needed"
StudentNurse,397by2,dustyoldbones,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:30:25 2015 UTC,"I Hate saying this because I don't want to jynx myself, but no it isn't as bad as most people make it out to be. Granted, I am closer to the beginning than the end of my schooling. There is a lot of material,  but none of it is ""hard"" or in depth. My semesters are only 12 credit hours, but classes have a lecture, lab, and clinical component, so a 3 credit hour class can turn into 9 hours.  Another reason of why I believe students complain is because this is a big change of lifestyle for them. Most students in my class are 20-22. Many of them have never even had a job, responsibilities, bills, etc. They are used to being able to go out during the weeknights, sleep in, and be part of clubs/ sports.once they start taking more time.consuming nursing classes, with 6 am clinicals, sometimes weekend requirements, and lots of tests, it becomes difficult to maintain that lifestyle. The transition can be tough because they have to learn how to prioritize.   They have friends or roomates In many other degrees that aren't as intensive, and compare themselves to those people.roomate Suzy who is a psychology major can go out every night, study for half hour before the test and get an A , and only have 12 credit hours of class 12-4 mon-wed. You're life now seems a lot harder than all of your friends ' lives.   I am not judging, because I was previously  ""Suzy"". It is a hard transition in that point if time for a 20 year old. But now I am working on my second bachelors degree, in nursing and I am a little older than most of my cohort. These are just my observations."

Kaplan has a pretty similar book with an online practice bank listed for $35 and has more of a strategy base.  Plenty of my classmates used primarily that book and passed also.

I took my exam July 3, I didn't want to wait, so I did lots of questions. I recommend practicing doing 200 at a time when you get closer to taking the test.

StudentNurse,39494v,CopaceticGeek,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:51:25 2015 UTC,Mine is on wednesday too! Eek! I did the Hurst review and about 1000 questions out of the Saunders book. Good luck!
StudentNurse,39494v,adickman18,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:25:03 2015 UTC,I used ATI questions and wrote rationals + lab values + pharmacology + cram sheet into Quizlet for additional brain frying.  Good luck guys!
StudentNurse,39494v,measchway,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:37:49 2015 UTC,"All I did to study were Kaplan questions. I averaged about 75 a day, over a one week period of time. Passed at 75, at about an hour and a quarter into the test."
StudentNurse,39494v,macavity_is_a_dog,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:44:47 2015 UTC,thank you <333 you're making me feel prepared lol
StudentNurse,39494v,adickman18,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:07:58 2015 UTC,I thought the PVT no longer worked?
StudentNurse,39494v,adickman18,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:56:28 2015 UTC,Worked for me!
StudentNurse,39494v,trudreamer_88,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:33:42 2015 UTC,Taking this test in sept. What's PVT?
StudentNurse,39494v,lhop1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:24:14 2015 UTC,"Pearson Vue Trick: to see if you passed minutes after taking the nclex enter all of your info again and if it doesn't charge you $200, then you unofficially passed."
StudentNurse,39494v,lhop1,2,Tue Jun 9 18:24:40 2015 UTC,"You don't need to pay the $200, just put the wrong expiration date, everything else correctly and it still works. I explained it all in my original post, update 2.0."
StudentNurse,39494v,lhop1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:25:29 2015 UTC,wow thats awesome. I didn't even think of that thank you!!!!
StudentNurse,39494v,lhop1,0,Tue Jun 9 21:15:12 2015 UTC,"Then you failed,  lol. I just had it work for me."
StudentNurse,39494v,lhop1,-2,Thu Jun 11 10:02:44 2015 UTC,"Then, unless you tried yourself within this week your opinion of the PVT is irrelevant.  I saw your troll posts on other threads as well, chances are your mock nursing degree is also a joke."
StudentNurse,39494v,YordlePoro,-1,Thu Jun 11 13:38:22 2015 UTC,"Right, you sure showed me here in reddit.  If you're even a nurse (highly unlikely) you're the type that sits at the PC blogging with 6 call lights on, or maybe a PCA/LPN trying to pseudo-expand your scope by inflating your tittle.  Get out of here kid, you're a fraud and a poor troll.  I'm flattered you admire RNs, so much you pretend to be one on the Internet, but delirium is only acute, delusion is schizo.  Get help; of course, you knew that, lol."

StudentNurse,39494v,Derparita,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:09:10 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks!  If you read my update on the original post I explained how it works."
StudentNurse,39494v,salmonhead,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:55:01 2015 UTC,Thanks! I will probably try to do this after I take my test but I might be too nervous. We'll see how I feel getting out of the test
StudentNurse,39494v,spicesoup153,3,Thu Jun 11 23:19:03 2015 UTC,"Best of luck to you.  There are different types of nervous people... I couldn't stop checking, I checked so much that I woke up this morning early so I could check Pearson Vue again.  Luckily, the board of nursing in Florida updated a lot faster than Pearson Vue and it was FREE! I recommend you don't over-study at least 2 days before the test and just do questions and basic labs values/pharmacology.  If you review concepts you won't get anywhere."
StudentNurse,39494v,spicesoup153,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:25:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip! I really need to buckle down and start studying. I'll probably become calm like the day before/two days before. Im on a cruise all of next week, so I think that is making me a little anxious, because the prospects for studying are pretty slim."
StudentNurse,39494v,wayoftherobot,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:09:25 2015 UTC,"I'll tell  you a secret... The only studying I did was after I created my Quizlet, then I dedicated to going through the flashcards at least once a day on my phone.  Like while I used the restroom, or when my wife nagged."
StudentNurse,39494v,rhkenji,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:24:27 2015 UTC,"Haha thats a great idea! I just wrote out most of my cards for lab values, but i'll go over to quizlet and remake them there so I can have them on the go."
StudentNurse,391izo,GumbysPeen,13,Mon Jun 8 15:58:21 2015 UTC,"If Flo came back, she'd spend all her time advocating for windows that actually open and have no time for the NCLEX."
StudentNurse,391izo,stacefromspace,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:02:39 2015 UTC,I really don't get why windows don't open in most patient rooms. So many patients of mine have expressed how much they would like to have an open window.
StudentNurse,391izo,lhop1,3,Tue Jun 9 22:29:43 2015 UTC,Flo could come back as a zombie and I bet she would still move faster than this one lazy hot mess I work with. Just sayin'.
StudentNurse,391izo,StefaniePags,2,Mon Jun 8 20:05:56 2015 UTC,"Good luck on your test... I just took mine today, I did the Pearson Vue ""trick"" and I got the good pop-up (yes, I'm a believer...I hope) - wish me luck!"
StudentNurse,391izo,itspurulentnotpussy,3,Tue Jun 9 03:15:27 2015 UTC,"Good luck to you too! Btw, dat username. . ."
StudentNurse,391izo,itspurulentnotpussy,3,Tue Jun 9 03:56:53 2015 UTC,"LOL! Yeah, when I made the username I remembered my second year of nursing school.  I was reading the medical record of a patient during clinical when I came across the descriptive drainage a nurse wrote down."
StudentNurse,391izo,YeahImJustThatAwesom,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:59:23 2015 UTC,"If it makes you feel better, the pearson trick still works completely. I have myself and a lot of nursing classmates who can vouch for it. (i took it a couple of months ago)"
StudentNurse,392nv2,inacognito,8,Mon Jun 8 20:32:36 2015 UTC,Do not wait until the last minute to read your chapters. Start 1 week early. If your class is on Monday then start the Monday before and divide the pages by 7. Normally I never have to read more than 8 pages a day and you'll be done with the chapter by Sunday night. If your class is on Tuesday then do it the Tuesday before etc. It works like a charm. The brain likes to learn in small chunks and the day of class should not be the first time you hear that material. Dividing everything I do by 7 has given me more time for family and friends!
StudentNurse,392nv2,michcake,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:24:31 2015 UTC,"Every week I will ""debrief"" myself on what is due, what needs to be done and whatnot. My school issues us a Microsoft Office suite and I use the calendar on the Outlook email system. Along with that, I keep a giant whiteboard in my room that serves as a monthly calendar with assignment due dates, appointments, etc.   I just got in too and I've been using the things above for prereqs and it has been good so far.   Tip: for physical planners, I like using the Pilot Frixion pens; they are erasable and are good for color coding classes and stuff.   Good luck!"
StudentNurse,392nv2,Generoh,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:31:31 2015 UTC,"Go all out for the midterm (read the books, listen to lecture recordings, Lecture slides, practice question, etc). The you will have an idea how the professor gives test. Then for the finals you know how to focus your studies.   Also buy a planner and schedule one day a week with family and friends. Burnout in school is real"
StudentNurse,392nv2,Caledon1976,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:06:22 2015 UTC,"Keep track of your time then check your records to evaluate it. With that information you can allocate your to-dos better, be more productive and have a better quality of life.  You can do that in many ways. i suggest an app. i myself use Time Tracking by primaERP. Google it and give it a try.  Good luck and all the best!"
StudentNurse,392nv2,honeyboo311,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:33:26 2015 UTC,Use a planner - I made my own that has everything just the way that I like it.  Work really hard during the week and give yourself weekends off.
StudentNurse,392nv2,dustyoldbones,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:51:42 2015 UTC,This is what I do ( unless there is a test on monday or I am REALLY bored ). But try telling this to most students and they will look at you like you are crazy.
StudentNurse,393onf,llolo96,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:02:56 2015 UTC,The navy is swamped with people who want to be nurses from what I've heard. There's very little chance that route is doable.
StudentNurse,38zrzx,FearAndLoafing,10,Mon Jun 8 05:13:32 2015 UTC,nursing staff is alert and pleasantly confused.    I'm not convinced i don't do the same thing :P

StudentNurse,38zrzx,doppleganger88,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:10:56 2015 UTC,"I must have picked it up when I learned my head-to-toe assessment in Fundamentals, either hearing it or reading it as ""orientated"". I realized I was wrong when I Googled it while at work, I had been charting it on my client because she was recovering from an infection that caused delirium. I was mortified!"
StudentNurse,38zrzx,VGRonin,4,Tue Jun 9 22:06:12 2015 UTC,"It could be worse... I just realized at 28 years old that I had been misspelling ""maybe"" wrong my entire life and no one bothered to correct me... For some reason I always spelled it ""mabye"". I also think it's a combination of autocorrect doing its job nicely."
StudentNurse,38zrzx,notme1414,3,Mon Jun 8 14:14:30 2015 UTC,Actually orientated is a word.
StudentNurse,38zrzx,tziy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:30:28 2015 UTC,True. I could play it off and claim every one of my patients attended an imaginary orientation multiple times? :/
StudentNurse,38zrzx,laurellama,3,Tue Jun 9 22:01:37 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest I read it three times before I looked at the tldr and until I did, I didn't get it haha"
StudentNurse,38zrzx,SqueezeTheShamansTit,2,Mon Jun 8 07:55:16 2015 UTC,It took me a minute to realize what was wrong with it too 😂 Need. More. Sleep.
StudentNurse,38zrzx,dustyoldbones,2,Mon Jun 8 11:34:24 2015 UTC,I spent my first semester smugly giggling when my teacher said dilitation instead of dilation. I truly did not know it was a word.
StudentNurse,38ynjs,afewseconds,20,Sun Jun 7 23:26:57 2015 UTC,"I knew this one person, they had to take the nclex in about 2 weeks, but instead of studying the just procrastinated, collected rare pepe's and posted memes on reddit. Legend was it took them 2 tries to pass the test."
StudentNurse,38ynjs,562dreezy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:45:10 2015 UTC,Ha! This made me smile.
StudentNurse,38ynjs,kippirnicus,7,Mon Jun 8 05:10:16 2015 UTC,Oh dear. I'm so sorry. I am studying...just wanted a break every so often to inspire me to study more. Haha
StudentNurse,38ynjs,wkenneth1,5,Sun Jun 7 23:50:23 2015 UTC,"I wish I had one to share. Mine was over fast, nowhere near as hard as it was made out to be. The other classmates that took it the same day I did had no horror stories either."
StudentNurse,38ynjs,tjh28,2,Sun Jun 7 23:59:41 2015 UTC,I'm always curious what did you think it was going to be like? And what did actually end up being like?
StudentNurse,38ynjs,wkenneth1,5,Mon Jun 8 00:27:46 2015 UTC,"Well, I figured it would be like every other test, just getting harder along the way. To be honest, I wasn't prepared to do all 265 questions, I went in there ready for 75.  As far as what it was actually like, it was easier than I thought by a large margin. Maybe 2 questions I went back and forth between answers, the rest I felt were pretty obvious. Lots of select all that apply on mine.  I finished in 75 questions. At 730 I went inside, they started the process of checking me in, around 8 I went into the test room, and was back at my car before 830. In all, the process was easier than nursing school itself."
StudentNurse,38ynjs,tjh28,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:49:23 2015 UTC,Wow that sounds like a great experience! Here's to hoping mine is similar.
StudentNurse,38ynjs,nerdynurse88,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:32:37 2015 UTC,Damn.....
StudentNurse,38ynjs,wkenneth1,2,Mon Jun 8 15:39:48 2015 UTC,I know. I have a harder time getting a drivers license renewed. Those people have a good system set up there at Pearson.
StudentNurse,38ynjs,Plkjhgfdsa,4,Tue Jun 9 22:44:50 2015 UTC,"What are you using as your study method...besides procrastination? I mean, I used that method as well, so no judging coming from here"
StudentNurse,38ynjs,Plkjhgfdsa,3,Wed Jun 10 00:50:42 2015 UTC,"Haha I'm glad to be receiving no judgement. I did both hurst and Kaplan. So I'm reviewing the hurst material about 6 hours a day. It's rough.  You? LPT: coordinate a Kaplan review for your graduating class from nursing school, at least 25 people, and you will receive a free course for being a ""student advocate"". A $500 course for free. A pleasant surprise, absolutely."
StudentNurse,38ynjs,salmonhead,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:17:33 2015 UTC,"That's actually a great tip! I took a hurst course with my classmates and I absolutely loved every second of it. I wish we had taken it a year before graduating. I would listen to the review lectures while I'd drive an hour to study with my parent. And entire 4 weeks was dedicated to nothing but Hurst which sucked because Christmas and New Years fell within those 4 weeks. :) But I passed with 76 questions, so I have no regrets. You'll do great!! Just remember to chose the answer that keeps the patient alive!!"
StudentNurse,38ynjs,CopaceticGeek,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:25:48 2015 UTC,Four weeks of just hurst review material? Dang. Did you feel like that was too much time? How many out of the 125 question hurst tests were you getting correct before you took the NCLEX?
StudentNurse,38ynjs,salmonhead,2,Mon Jun 8 06:31:11 2015 UTC,SATA is my nightmare and I keep seeing people say they had like 20-30 of them.  Taking it in about 9 days.
StudentNurse,38ynjs,MissusL,2,Mon Jun 8 06:36:19 2015 UTC,"Just remember, if you're seeing a lot of SATA questions that is a good thing. They're supposed to be passing level questions. If you're getting straight definition questions, then you might be failing."

StudentNurse,38ynjs,Mursling,2,Tue Jun 9 13:51:41 2015 UTC,My friend was rear ended on her way to take her test. She flipped out on the guy ha. She still made it in time to test and passed.
StudentNurse,38ynjs,lurknomoretoday,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:58:39 2015 UTC,Dang. It's always good to leave super early I guess!
StudentNurse,38ynjs,Vana21,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:40:38 2015 UTC,"Took the NCLEX and ended up doing all 265 questions. Knew I was in trouble when I'd see a similar question pop up over and over again. Had about 4 other friends who took it and did all 265 questions as well, they passed, I'm retaking it on the 10th."
StudentNurse,38ynjs,Mursling,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:06:27 2015 UTC,"With failing and taking it again, what mistakes do you think you made the first time around? And what have you done to ensure you pass this time? (I sound like my retention councilor. I'm just curious. Haha)"
StudentNurse,38ynjs,Vana21,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:06:46 2015 UTC,"The first time I took the NCLEX I didn't have a well rounded grasp on all the content (as you know, there's a lot of it). And I felt that if I had a better understanding of that content I'd be better able to apply critical thinking and answer more questions correctly. So the second time around I took the Hurst NCLEX review course (it's really good) and tried to cover more information."
StudentNurse,38ynjs,Mursling,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:05:59 2015 UTC,good luck!!!!
StudentNurse,38ynjs,Vana21,-1,Fri Jun 12 20:46:25 2015 UTC,Do remember that a special select few people regardless of how correct or incorrect their answers are do get the entire test. They do this to test questions out
StudentNurse,38ynjs,lurknomoretoday,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"Sarcasm?   If not, everything I've read and been told says that that's a myth. It is based solely on that passing line. I'd agree with that too seeing as I knew when I got questions wrong and noticed I was back doing easier ones (or vice versa)."
StudentNurse,38wcjt,562dreezy,12,Sun Jun 7 11:24:07 2015 UTC,"First of all, screw ATI to the deepest, darkest, smelliest corner of Hell.   Other than that it's a pretty good study guide for everything so far. We use ATI as an exit exam type deal for all our core classes. The books they publish are a good reference for a quick study right before a test or something.   Edit: I just personally don't like it because it's just one more test we have to take at the end of every semester. Form your own opinion though!"
StudentNurse,38wcjt,Thechubbyprotestant,5,Sun Jun 7 12:40:56 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%, FUCK ATI!!!  I have friends in other schools that use HESI and I found it to be far superior to ATI. Does your school make you do the ATI GreenLight before taking NCLEX? If so, good luck!! GreenLight is the biggest joke!!! If you have to remediate a section it takes DAYS. I had to remediate Peds and I got assigned 26 hours of video to watch, it was brutal. Not a fan of ATI"
StudentNurse,38wcjt,DanTheButcher,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:08:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I have to take the green light thing.

StudentNurse,38wcjt,tibtibs,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:47:48 2015 UTC,It just sucks cause I've purchased the rest of my books for cheap on amazon but because our school has a contract with ati we have to buy it from the bookstore otherwise we don't get the code from the teacher.
StudentNurse,38wcjt,Niquebleek,2,Sun Jun 7 20:36:37 2015 UTC,"ATIs can be hell. My school uses them at the end of the semester as pass/fail. Fail it twice and you have to wait until the next year to take the whole class over and take it again. 20 people just failed the pharm Ati and are screwed til then.  If your school does this, study them like a second class, at least for the last 3-4 weeks before the test and always look up lab values because I've found their books don't emphasize them enough."

StudentNurse,38v2yj,King_Supreme,7,Sun Jun 7 02:21:03 2015 UTC,"There are a ton more jobs than just these two areas. You can work in case management, MDS, training, staff development and many other things. Hopefully you like paperwork more than feces."

StudentNurse,38v2yj,smart_cereal,5,Sun Jun 7 03:31:29 2015 UTC,If you work in mental health in the community setting you generally don't have to deal with poop or if you became a nurse educator.
StudentNurse,38v2yj,Llamapants,6,Sun Jun 7 05:00:52 2015 UTC,"Sometimes there is poop in mental health, it's generally found on the walls, on the floor, on the ceiling, and sometimes all over the pt. Just depends on what part of the mental health field you are working in."
StudentNurse,38v2yj,smart_cereal,2,Sun Jun 7 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"That's why I said community, because you're generally visiting people who are well enough post-discharge to go home. Even if you find poop in their house, you aren't the obligated person to clean it up."

StudentNurse,38v2yj,speedlimits65,5,Sun Jun 7 02:22:25 2015 UTC,"honestly, dealing with feces isnt that bad. i dreaded it before going to nursing school. they expose you so much to it after the 4th or 5th time you stop caring. it's not like your picking up poop, you just wipe them and the remainder gets bundled in the sheets you toss out."
StudentNurse,38v2yj,iibubblepop,3,Sun Jun 7 15:55:40 2015 UTC,"I don't have to deal with ""that much"" poo. My CNAs are wonderful. I think in nursing school I had to deal with it A LOT more. I'm in oncology."
StudentNurse,38v2yj,ChaplnGrillSgt,2,Sun Jun 7 13:47:30 2015 UTC,Basically anything outpatient.
StudentNurse,38v2yj,vigor145,2,Sun Jun 7 17:50:06 2015 UTC,Non-bedside........you could work in Psych. But instead of wiping asses you'd probably be cleaning it off the wall.  :-/
StudentNurse,38v2yj,ZingMaster,3,Tue Jun 9 14:07:40 2015 UTC,"Eh. You're in the wrong profession. Regardless of your job as a nurse, we are all a team and sometimes poop happens. It's not that bad after a while, it becomes second nature.   Don't be one of those nurses who calls their CNA in to do a clean up that would have taken you less than a minute."
StudentNurse,38v2yj,notme1414,5,Sun Jun 7 22:52:15 2015 UTC,Yes but most require bedside experience first. Maybe nursing is not for you.
StudentNurse,38vkty,laurellama,4,Sun Jun 7 04:59:46 2015 UTC,"Prep, prep, prep. I take a day on the weekend to prep. I'll make breakfast sandwiches, prep raw veggies and dips, and chicken and rice in containers. Most of it comes together while I'm doing other things, so it doesn't take a ton of time. Whenever I make spaghetti or something for dinner, I'll make a double batch and freeze the other half to have another night too. Snacks are key for me too, so I make sure I have the veggies handy, and buy things like yogurt, cheese, almonds, anything that will keep me going for a while longer without being awful for me."

StudentNurse,38vkty,SillySafetyGirl,3,Sun Jun 7 13:11:39 2015 UTC,"And you can easily do some of the ""work"" while studying. Rice takes a while to cook, chicken needs to marinate, etc. use it to break up study session and you'll stay productive!"

We work nights and I invested in a nicer crockpot, so we can just throw it in when we come home, cook for 5 hours then it sets itself to warm. That way it doesn't get overdone. We live like this and the food isn't the healthiest but it is better than going out. When I was in paramedic school, I literally ate out 95% of my meals.

See if you can claim your own cabinet space and put your food in there. This way when you're exhausted and don't need to be thinking way too hard about food, the things you want are right there. Just don't open anyone else's cabinet. This is how I dealt with living with others that weren't eating the way I was."

I also drive a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. I was pretty much an outlier and non-traditional student in every class and every clinical I took.   Advice? Time management. Time management. Time management. Manage your time. Seriously. That's it. If you can master time management then you will be far less stressed and much more successful.

I just finished my 1st semester. My cohort began with 80 students and at the end of the semester we had 70. Of those, one lady is 46, two students are 32, and one is 30. The rest are on average 20 year olds.  Then you have me. I had a VERY HARD time feeling a ""part of""/fitting in. I really thought this school would have more non-traditional students. On one hand I am very focused and wanted to study. So I started with this 20 year old study group but they were not as focused. When they would begin talking about something and laughing, either I did not know what they were talking about or just did not find the same things humorous. Time management is the key but my school stresses the importance of study groups. Well they don't work for me. By the end of the semester I had hooked up with another 30-something year old. We work alone mostly but we are with each other......that way we can bounce our thoughts off of each other.  And if one of us has a question the other can help. Overall, for the amount of prestige my school gets and all I am paying........I feel like I am in high school all over again. I didn't like high school the first time around!! Oh, the competitiveness amongst each student is UNREAL."

Honestly can't wait to start working, i love acute care but seriously hoping to move into a management level pronto as i've already got the background to deal with infection control, budgets, time management etc and over here it seems many nurses don't want the extra responsibility of paperwork when i feel like its less responsibility than ensuring you know what to do when a patient decides to code out of the blue or you have 20 controlled drugs and no second nurse to double check!"

StudentNurse,38rayx,salmonhead,2,Sun Jun 7 22:09:51 2015 UTC,"It is my personal opinion that Kaplan questions are harder than what I encountered on the NCLEX. The general idea is the same (""which patient should you see first?"", ""which phone call should you return first?"", ""which intervention is MOST important at this time?"", etc) but the answer choices are not obscure. They are clear cut and all you have to do is assess the situation and choose the best answer, whereas with Kaplan I seriously felt like half the questions were mind games."
StudentNurse,38pphx,tjh28,2,Fri Jun 5 20:06:43 2015 UTC,"Literally just took the NCLEX this past Tuesday, got my passing results yesterday with 76 questions.  For one, don't read the forums on Allnurses about it, they're obnoxious.  However, on the Hurst Q reviews, first couple I got a 75/125. Finished with a few in the low to mid 80s. 84 is the median score Hurst recommends to be ''prepared''. Don't worry about the percentage score.   But, I also have a ton of classmates that just passed too, and some of their scores were all over the place, ranging from low 60s to mid 70s, with the occasional 80-something.   I think the best thing you can do is go over ALL the Hurst material, 5th day stuff and everything. Memorize the ''rules'' on how to pass. Think worst-case scenario, assume the patient is going to possibly die, etc.   After you've done all that, take your last few Q reviews to see how you've improved. Definitely read all of the rationales for each question as they're immensely helpful (I thought so at least). Anything you're consistently doing poorly on, just go over again via the handbook or videos.  You'll be fine. You've gotten this far, and Hurst is a fantastic review program. Good luck!"

I imagine you'd eventually earn more than working retail parttime. Plus, you will learn a lot -- the CNAs in my program do have an edge (albeit not a gigantic one) in terms of therapeutic communication and procedures. Plus, a lot of their facilities say they will hire them on as nurses immediately, so the networking and reputation-building will be useful. I'd MUCH rather spend my time as a CNA than working retail. Hands down. No question. Don't listen to your mama."

I was thinking about this too, but the certification courses actually cost more to become an EMT/Paramedic here than to become an LNA. Additionally, where I'm from EMTs are all volunteer so I wouldn't be able to make any money doing it (I hope that doesn't sound too terrible)."
StudentNurse,38jino,tziy,2,Thu Jun 4 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"The community college I went to offered CNA courses (it's actually set up there as a pre-req for your nursing classes), so as long as you were a part time student you could get financial aid to cover it.  Might be worth looking in to.  The Red Cross also offers CNA classes.  You should see if they do in your area and if it's any cheaper."
StudentNurse,38jino,charlottethespider,2,Fri Jun 5 01:30:32 2015 UTC,"Unless you can't afford to take the hit due to finances, I'd look into LNA some more. If you really want to become a nurse, having paid hospital experience and/or direct patient care, regardless of how much it helps you on your application, will help immensely when it comes time to find a job as an RN."
StudentNurse,38jino,charlottethespider,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:35:34 2015 UTC,"Look into whether programs care if you are a LNA. All the programs I applied to only looked at GPA and test scores. They didn't care about anything outside of that. But otherwise, getting hospital experience will never hurt you gain experience in a working setting and the skills will help you a lot in your clinical rotations in school and beyond."

Moreover, I'm hoping that the skills I'd learn as an LNA would help, even if it's only slightly, with my classes before and during nursing school."
StudentNurse,38jino,macavity_is_a_dog,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:59:34 2015 UTC,Also (I forgot to add this) working can be a huge help when you're trying to find employment. I know people that were hired at the hospitals that they worked at purely because they were good CNAs and their supervisors liked them. Also I know people that have their school 100% paid for by the hospital with the agreement that they will continue to work there. Not sure if they made any agreement as to hiring after graduation but it wouldn't be surprising.
StudentNurse,38jino,lovelyone20,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:59:45 2015 UTC,"I worked as a CNA (which I think is likely the equivalent of LNA?) before applying to nursing school and was accepted into an ABSN program at a great university. I can't say that this is why I was accepted (I also had a good GPA, volunteer experience, solid work history, etc), but I do think it helped.  It was also helpful to me when I started clinicals.  The nurses who knew I was a CNA trusted me to be more independent with things like ambulating & bathing patients, changing linens, etc.  I also felt less intimidated than some of my classmates who had very little clinical experience.   It's definitely not a waste of time or money.  It may not necessarily help you get accepted, but it will help you in other ways!"
StudentNurse,38jino,DanKC,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:47:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying :) Yep--CNA and LNAs are the same thing. Do you mind if I ask how the ABSN program you're doing is? I've been trying to find someone who has done one but it is HARD! I figure working retail isn't really giving me any real life experience, so being a LNA/CNA would help expand my skill set. PLUS, I'd actually be making a ""decent"" amount of money instead of minimum wage."
StudentNurse,38jino,vigor145,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:03:34 2015 UTC,Get to your CNA and start doing home health STAT. Nothing in nursing is a waste of time. Experience and knowledge is everything.
StudentNurse,38hc5a,acangialosi01,6,Thu Jun 4 05:27:31 2015 UTC,"I just got done completing the Kaplan live review provided by my school.  The instructor there said that if you're scoring 65% on the practice tests, you're pretty much good to go.  Keep in mind, the NCLEX is designed such that students are only expected to get about 50% correct.    You'll do great.  Good luck!"
StudentNurse,38hc5a,spore,2,Thu Jun 4 07:17:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you!! Maybe I'm just over thinking it because to me, a 64 looks like a failing number. When I remediate and see all the ones I got wrong I'm like ""wow, I was 100% off base in my rationale on that"" lol. And that scares me!"
StudentNurse,38hc5a,wkenneth1,5,Thu Jun 4 15:03:18 2015 UTC,"Shit, I think the Kaplan questions were harder than Nclex questions. And honestly it sounds like you're studying way too much."
StudentNurse,38hc5a,wkenneth1,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:10:28 2015 UTC,Yeah I think I might be psyching myself out with all this content...
StudentNurse,38hc5a,Plkjhgfdsa,2,Thu Jun 4 15:04:52 2015 UTC,"It's possible. The nclex had been made out to be a trial by fire type of thing, and honestly, i didnt think it was that bad. Just take each question as they come, and leave the previous question behind."
StudentNurse,38hc5a,Plkjhgfdsa,4,Thu Jun 4 17:08:39 2015 UTC,"Take a deep breath, first... And review the Hurst content as much as you can. I haven't done anything with Kaplan, I just completed all of the hurst info plus the course. The exam is a lot easier than those questions that your studying. Just focus on knowing the base of the question and always remember to think ""What answer keeps the patient alive"". You sound like you're on all the right tracks, though! I was freaking out a week before my exam as well and I ended up passing with only 76 questions. My grades were not nearly as good as yours. Just believe in yourself and in your knowledge.  PS...the Pearson Vue trick of finding out if you passed the exam immediately after walking out of the building really does work. I did it when I got home, after my exam, because the drive was 2 hrs and I was sure that I failed....I was so happy when I got home and found out that I passed."
StudentNurse,38hc5a,Cissyrene,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:41:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your kind reply! Congrats on passing!! I think I'm getting emotional over the potential of losing this amazing career opportunity. I've never had test anxiety, I've always done well on tests. I just can't stop thinking about how this test is different and that maybe I won't be good at it like I have been on other nursing exams. Anyways, I'll DEFINITELY do the Pearson trick lol. Would you say the Hurst questions were comparable to the NCLEX in style and difficulty?"
StudentNurse,38hc5a,dee789,2,Thu Jun 4 06:01:46 2015 UTC,"Style - yes. Difficulty - honestly? No. I felt like NCLEX was easier. Study those rationales on Hurst like crazy, though! Just remember, you don't have to pass 75 questions - you have to pass 60! 15 are pilot questions. Also, I had a girl in my class pass after 236 questions - that is nerve-wracking! And you won't lose your job (I hope!) you'll just have to wait 45 days until you retake it ....but none of that matters because you'll pass the first time! If you've passed Nursing school, you've got this. I know the test anxiety feeling, i have it as well, but keep in mind that no matter what, you will be a nurse. Don't feel defeated if you don't pass - I drove home for 2 hrs after my test mentally preparing to re-take the exam 45 days later....and then I passed! Oh, that's another thing, everyone I have talked has walked out thinking they didn't pass....that's normal! I promise!"
StudentNurse,38hc5a,wkenneth1,2,Thu Jun 4 06:13:44 2015 UTC,"Wow that is so incredibly helpful! Thank you so so much for your time answering and your encouragement! :) that is truly what I needed!

StudentNurse,38hc5a,destroyingtocreate,2,Thu Jun 4 06:30:05 2015 UTC,"I want to just confirm what /r/plkjhfdsa said. The test bank questions are more difficult than the NCLEX (I felt like, ymmv). And if you're getting select all that apply questions, you are where you need to be. I never thought I would be so happy to see them. But overtime one came up, I was like, I'm still in this!!"

StudentNurse,38hc5a,Plkjhgfdsa,2,Thu Jun 4 15:03:56 2015 UTC,"I think you're actually doing very well in Kaplan terms. Better than me, and I am planning to test ASAP after I get my ATT! I took the course and was told to aim for 60% on Qbank and 60% on Qtrainers 6 and 7. Kaplan is supposed to be extremely hard and I don't know anyone who has consistently scored in the 70's."
StudentNurse,38hc5a,Plkjhgfdsa,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:50:32 2015 UTC,"May the easy questions smile upon you. Make sure you thoroughly understand what the question is asking, skipping one word can change the whole thing."
StudentNurse,38hc5a,Plkjhgfdsa,2,Thu Jun 4 22:15:27 2015 UTC,"First of all - your Kaplan scores are good and suggest that you will have no problem passing NCLEX. Don't let your anxiety get the best of you. Confidence is key.  You have to trust that you will do well, that you know your content, that you are prepared and that you have done everything possible to pass this test when you walk into it.   Secondly, the passing rates are high. NCSBN publishes national passing rates every 3 months as well as the yearly pass rates. As of now, the pass rate for 2015 for first time NCLEX-RN test takers is 85.27%!! That's really good! The total passing rate for 2014 was 81.78% for first time test takers. These are really good numbers, considering.  So again, have some confidence!  Lastly - from my own personal experience, the boards were not as difficult as many people made it out to be. Everyone will have their own experience with the test. But just keep in mind this is not a test of trickery, rather a test of minimum nursing knowledge.  As long as you can prioritize, and as long as you know your common disease processes, nursing interventions, skills, medications, how to properly delegate, as well as labs and medical terminology... you should be fine.  And while I understand that your residency program is important to you, passing NCLEX has to come first. It wouldn't be the end of the world if (god forbid) you didn't pass. You have to prioritize in your life as well - and NCLEX has to come first. There will be other opportunities.. so don't let the fear/stress/anxiety of not passing overwhelm you and keep you from doing well.     Good luck. : )"
StudentNurse,38hc5a,Plkjhgfdsa,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:58:33 2015 UTC,"This is so encouraging and such great advice! Looking at it from the perspective of the percentages helps me a lot.. I mean statistically it's more likely to be in that 80% that does pass than the 20% that doesn't. And you're right about priorities in life, seeing the NCLEX as my only priority for the ""here and now"" helps A LOT. Thanks for your reply!!!"
StudentNurse,38hc5a,azbartender,2,Fri Jun 5 06:36:50 2015 UTC,I am in the SAME boat as you. My exam is on July 2nd and I'm getting really scared. My Kaplan course is next week and I hope it helps. I've been doing 100+ questions a day and now I'm going over content with Saunders and another book I have. I just hope it works because I just got a job today! Good luck to you! I know you'll do great!
StudentNurse,38hc5a,tziy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:59:33 2015 UTC,"Aww thank you! I think you'll feel at least a little better after Kaplan, it does really help you understand how to find what the question is looking for and how to think through it. The way I see it is knowledge is power, and Kaplan helps you understand how NCLEX works! I'm sure you'll do just fine as well, good luck! :)"

StudentNurse,38k9dg,tziy,3,Fri Jun 5 09:31:19 2015 UTC,"Business cards by graduate nurses have not been part of the professional culture. Once you have a specialty certification or advanced degree, then having cards on hand seems more useful.   Most employers know what they can get out of a new grad. What makes you stand out is your previous career history. That is going to be on a resumé rather than a card. The QR idea is cool but I wonder how many nurse recruiters would even know how to use it?  To me a business card is just that, a card identifying you and the business you work for. A student does not work for the school and you are not yet an independent businessperson. My vote would be to wait on the cards until you have the credentials and position to advertise."
StudentNurse,38k9dg,rneducator,2,Sat Jun 13 13:57:08 2015 UTC,"The way I see it is it's better to have them and not need them, than to need them and not have them.   In other words, go for it. To me, it'll make you look like a go-getter and will make you seem more professional than a fellow student who scribbles his or her email down on a torn piece of paper to give to a potential manager.   Tip: you may be able to get your hands on business cards that have your school's logo and such on them. My university allows students, faculty, and staff to make business cards, which look really neat and ""official."""

StudentNurse,38cjba,cmndr_keen,4,Wed Jun 3 09:48:19 2015 UTC,"As with anything in nursing, you cannot just memorize stuff (usually) .. you need to understand and know WHY you're giving the medications and HOW they work. Making a random note card is pointless if you have nothing to connect it to.   For example:   ACE Inhibitors are the primary treatment in heart failure. Why? They prevent the conversion from Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II. What does that mean, why is that key to understanding ACE Inhibitor's treatment in HF?  It requires you to understand the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), aldosterone, and how fluid and sodium work in the body.   Heart Failure can be either right-sided heart failure or left-sided heart failure. If it's right-sided, that means there will be systemic edema, and if it's left-sided the edema will be pulmonary. So the patient needs to get rid of this edema (fluid) and ACE Inhibitors work on the Renin-Angiotensin System to eliminate fluid.   When you eliminate a lot of fluid (regardless of the situation/reason), side effects that can be expected are hypotension and tachycardia. Especially if the elimination occurs quickly. They may also experience dizziness, fatigue, and headache (which can be results of the hypotension/fluid loss). If the patient experiences N/V/D - they are at risk for hyperklemia. And a special note about ACE Inhibitors is that it is common for the patient to have a dry, hacking cough. And if this occurs, the MD will often switch the patient to an ARB, which is very similar to the ACE minus the cough.  You need to do patient teaching with medications - teach the patent how to take a blood pressure. Teach proper diet (they may require a low sodium diet and fluid restriction - think back to the Renin Angiotensin System and aldosterone!)  Teach not to discontinue/abruptly stop the medication due to rebound hypertension (ACE Inhibitors is a treatment for hypertension as well, and with HF we went to keep the BP controlled). And of course, no over the counter meds, take the medication as instructed, and call the MD if...   Lastly, your ACE inhibitors end in ""pril"" .. When you are studying them individually - you can look for things that stand out, like with Captopril, it's typically noted that it should be taken 20-60 minutes before a meal, as opposed to other ACE Inhibs which are taken on an empty stomach. So, it's the odd man out.   And as always, I highly recommend the book Saunders Comprehensive Review 6th Edition - which has your medications laid out perfectly after each chapter E.g Adult Endocrine Disorders followed by Endocrine Medications; Adult Cardiovascular Disorders followed by Cardiovascular Medications (it also has fundamentals, maternity, pediatrics, and psychology and all their meds too).  Good luck."

StudentNurse,38c6pm,tziy,2,Wed Jun 3 11:33:08 2015 UTC,I currently work at a college of health sciences and our admissions counselors recommend that applicants volunteer (or work as a CNA if possible) in a hospital/health care facility. This tells them that you have done some independent research on your chosen career path and feel it's the right choice for you. This is great because admissions counselors want to know that they are accepting students who will be dedicated to completing their program. I hope this helps a little!

My wife teaches high school chemistry and physics and complains that one of the major problems with the students she gets its that they can't think critically.

My sister has had grand mal seizures since I was a kid and while it isn't exactly like a code, you kind of learn to keep your cool when someone is unconscious and bleeding from their head from hitting it so hard against the concrete.   I think the biggest misconception people have about test anxiety is that they don't understand the material. My test anxiety stems from nursing school. Trying to get into nursing school, every single grade counts. Which is kind of a good reason for anxiety. One mess up and you can completely squash your chances. Then, you get into nursing school and if you get below a 78% on an exam you failed it. And when your exams are the only thing you are graded on, that causes a lot of anxiety. Just because something comes natural to some people doesn't mean it does to others. I've watched nursing students who are amazing at tests, but don't know how to handle real life situations. I've watched nursing students with test anxiety do really awful on exams, but put them in any situation on the floor and they can handle it no problem."

StudentNurse,38e10y,vigor145,2,Fri Jun 5 19:49:35 2015 UTC,"I love this downvote!! I am open minded to people being good test takers, why can't people be open minded to those who are bad test takers!"
StudentNurse,38e10y,vigor145,2,Sat Jun 6 23:00:57 2015 UTC,"Many of the instructors at my school have the attitude of ""I had to go through it, so you have to go through it""  I'm talking about stuff like squeezing pharmacology into half a semester, having 8 hours (after class the day before) to pick out a patient, do a care plan, and sleep, etc.  So to answer your question, I don't think most of the instructors (at least at my school) feel the same way. Whenever we question them about changing curriculum, they just say ""it builds character."""
StudentNurse,38djhl,essig,4,Wed Jun 3 14:50:39 2015 UTC,"There have already been several conversations about this on Reddit and AllNurses, plus the ATI website itself is quite comprehensive. Use Google and I'm sure you'll find plenty of answers to your questions.  The TEAS is a standardized test like the SATs, and you can study for it with several different practice books (I liked the McGraw-Hill 5 Practice Tests) and taking online practice tests from ATI (the makers of the real thing)."
StudentNurse,38djhl,xanthochrome,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:38:27 2015 UTC,I had to take the TEAS V and it really wasn't very hard if you've taken all of your required classes pretty recently. You should have already learned most of what's on there. Don't work yourself up over it too much. I think they have some books and other study help for it if you're stressing out over it that might make you feel more at ease.

Northern California is so rough for new grads, no residency programs, a handful of RN new grad positions and an influx of new grads at the end of every semester due to the 5 programs in the area.  As if just getting to and passing the NCLEX wasn't enough, the waiting for that opportunity is nerve-wracking.  Have you applied already? If not, do it now!"

StudentNurse,38a6w1,mayx2,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:57:33 2015 UTC,"I would call my state BON. I had trouble getting my ATT when I first registered and after waiting a long time, I ended up calling. Turned out that I accidentally clicked the wrong college (one below mine) when I was signing up online and they couldn't verify my information because of it.   They told me in such a case, no one contact you. You simply have to be proactive and call them if there are problems. Should only take a week to 2 at most."

StudentNurse,38a6w1,lamoreequi,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:52:00 2015 UTC,"New Grad from Ca here.  I went to the office last week (I live in Sacramento) and they told me that they are 12 weeks behind on processing and ATTs have been sent out about 10 weeks from the date of the payment  (which can be seen on the Breeze site).  When did she apply? The classmates that I was with that applied in March have started to receive their ATTs (BRN said they were processing mid March apps).  It's peak time for NCLEX scheduling but most have been able to schedule for June/early July.  You can call them, or if by chance are up in the Nor Cal area sometime soon stop by and plead your case.  Tell them you have a job offer but it is contingent on her taking the NCLEX by that date.  I have had friends in that situation who have had to practically hassel them to keep their job offers but it has worked for them all.  Tell her to be on the phone daily if need be!  Unfortunately I didn't apply until the 1st week of May so I'm stuck waiting.    Not sure if you've google searched, they just had another meeting with the State and have been approved for additional staff.  This has been an ongoing problem since the online applications started,  and it's really unacceptable for people to have to wait as long as they have been.  I've known people who have had their licenses post before ever even getting their IP and then had to go through the process of getting that refunded.  It's an absolute mess, but she has to advocate for herself and make sure they get her ball rolling!"
StudentNurse,389bl8,snaxy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:08:31 2015 UTC,"What semester are you?   Get a head start on next semesters content. Get the syllabus from someone, start reading and practice nclex questions over the material.   If you struggled on anything in your previous semester - review that content also."
StudentNurse,389bl8,destroyingtocreate,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:28:46 2015 UTC,"I use breaks for NCLEX prep! Get a book like Saunders or HESI review (make sure it's the RN version, not PN- they look very similar!) and read through and do practice questions on the content areas you've already gone through in school. Practice NCLEX questions are probably going to be your best bet.  As for studying the upcoming semesters content- that never worked for me and always left me frustrated and honestly a bit confused. I'm jealous of those of you who can prep like that!"
StudentNurse,387qlp,honeyboo311,2,Tue Jun 2 13:26:11 2015 UTC,"Kaplan teaches test taking strategy; Hurst teaches content (That is the main difference between the two, not that they don't focus elsewhere, but those are their priorities). There are other resources (e.g. NCSBN) but the battle is usually between these two.   If you are truly strong in your content, you will not require a strategy to answer a question.   I strongly recommend Hurst (online version). If you know your content, you can pass NCLEX. The online videos are awesome, engaging and funny. It teaches the ""need to know content"" meaning it's not re-teaching everything you learned in nursing school - because that would be impossible and unrealistic. They have an nclex question video review and 6 timed practice tests with 125 questions each.   Along with Hurst, I recommend using Saunders 6th Ed to re-enforce the content Hurst reviews and skills that you should be familiar with that could come up on the boards.  The other book I recommend as a supplement to Hurst is Lippincott Alternate Format Questions 5th Ed for practice nclex style questions (SATA, drag/drop, hot spot, and math). Get comfortable with those SATA for sure.   This was what I used (mainly) and I passed with 75 questions my first time. Good luck!"

StudentNurse,387qlp,destroyingtocreate,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:39:56 2015 UTC,"Well, let me say this... there is a lot of unnecessary hype about NCLEX. It's a good marketing scheme to scare people into thinking it's the hardest test they've ever taken, and that if they don't purchase every single test-prep source, they're going to fail. NCLEX is big money.   And the more freaked out, stressed out, worried, and anxiety driven you are - the more likely you're going to get that get the best of you - you'll over think questions, read into them, not trust yourself, and so on ... causing you to do poorly.  And if you have to re-take the NCLEX - that's more money spent.    People need to realize that just like everything else - there is money to be made, and when you have brand new nursing graduates who are taking ""the biggest test of their lives"" ... they'll do anything and everything ... spend tons of money to pass the first time... and it's really quite unnecessary if you ask me.   Pick a few sources, know your content. Know it well. And remember that NCLEX is not a test of trickery.  It's a test of prioritization, and there are certain things you should know as a new nurse.  I truly believe Hurst narrows it down very well and teaches it it in a way that is easy to understand and remember. Along side that, the books I mentioned are great supplements. But there's no need in doing NCSBN, Hurst, Kaplan, and buying every book on the market. Pick one major source and a few books, and stick to them!  : )"

You should qualify for a pell grant either now or next year when you will qualify as a independent student for FAFSA.   Make sure you talk to a real financial aid officer at your school and not just some work study student. If it makes you feel better about taking on all these loans take a look at public service loan forgiveness, nursing perkins loan forgiveness and income based repayment. Assuming you work for the govt federal/state/local or a non-profit org (most hospitals) you can get all of your loans forgiven in ten years max and only have to pay a max of 10-15% of discretionary income to your loans.  http://www.fastweb.com/financial-aid/articles/student-aid-and-scholarships-for-second-degree-students   https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service   https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts  https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven"

I do get the Pell grant which helps immensely. Thinking about taking out $4k extra a semester just seems daunting.   I talked to one of my nurse friends and she said that once I get my CNA it will be a ton easier so I'm trying to get that going ASAP.   Thanks for the advice!

That's not going to allow for cementing knowledge or skills. You're not meant to be a great nurse right out of school, you're meant to be safe.  These things will come with time, until then (and beyond) you learn from your mistakes and carry that lesson with you and let the rest go.

The instructor even sent me an email saying that I was on the verge of failing that simulation.   You know what I did? I cried. And then I went back to study. I went back to study the situation and practice all the techniques, even those I have already master. The second simulation, I aced it.   The way you performed during simulations doesn't mean that you are/are going to be a bad nurse. The important thing is that you can learn from your mistakes and not repeat them."

Sim labs exist to help you go through the motions, make mistakes, and understand more about the actual act of bedside nursing, instead of just reading about it.

StudentNurse,384jyk,trobo84,3,Tue Jun 2 03:05:35 2015 UTC,"What are you looking for in a university?   To be honest, I have no knowledge of programs in MA, but it looks like Laboure College is a very specialized school for healthcare and Westfield State is a traditional 4-year university. If you're looking for the traditional college feel, WSU is the way to go. Alternatively, if you are just looking to get your nursing degree and leave, I'd say LC would be good.   However, looking at the Massachusetts Board of Nursing website, 91 of 151 students (60%) from LC passed their NCLEX on their first try and 17 out of 21 students (81%) from WSU passed on their first try. I would consider these statistics when considering.  http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/researcher/physical-health/nursing/nclex/2014-performance-summary-for-massachusetts-nursing-educ.html  To me, I would go with the WSU, because personally I enjoy the college feel that I have at my university."
StudentNurse,384jyk,DanKC,2,Tue Jun 2 04:10:52 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on if you can afford it. I got into a community college that was pretty cheap and a well known university, and went with the university because they are a teaching hospital with much better clinicals and more unique opportunities (4 week optional clinical rotation in Nicaragua, each term we can sign up for observations in areas of interest, opportunity to do everything through the VA hospital, etc.). I wasn't very responsible about weighing out finances, but luckily it all worked out and I got a very large scholarship after my first year that will pay the rest of my BSN and 2 yrs of grad school. I would be wary of a brand new program, sometimes it takes a while to work out the kinks. Are they accredited? On the other hand, where I live the private schools don't have the best relationships with hospitals, and a larger portion of clinicals are in long-term care.  I'd take into consideration first where you can afford, second where the attrition rates and NCLEX pass rates are better, third where you think you'll get the best education and have the best feeling about it. And then I'd say apply for lots of scholarships!"

StudentNurse,383ymr,YanksFan,2,Tue Jun 2 16:20:00 2015 UTC,"If you have the money, do Hurst online. You'll be glad you did. You'll be much more prepared for your NCLEX-RN boards or any exit exams you have during your senior year. Also, if you buy the program, you'll have a years ""access"" to the site. Meaning - some videos and the test bank you'll have access to for the entire year. The rest of the vids you can renew for $50.  So.. if you take your nclex within the year and want to use the videos again, it's only $50.. kind of a sweet deal, I think.  (Edit: to clarify, Hurst costs $350 for 90 days (online version).. but you have some stuff (videos, test bank) for a year... and during that year at any time you can pay $50 to renew full access again for 30 days as many times you want during the year).  If you don't do that or even if you do, I (also) recommend finding a volunteer program at a hospital where you sign on for X amount of hours (usually something like 100-300 hours within so many months). Or a float pool nursing program for student nurses (like a residency type thing for senior nursing students, done outside of nursing school, but must currently be enrolled in a nursing program).  Or, look for a CNA job, patient transport job... just something, anything in a hospital. Because depending on where you live, entry level positions can be difficult to land, and these are the things that are going to look good/stand out to employers.   Edit: see above"

StudentNurse,380qjp,vote4petro,18,Mon Jun 1 01:18:58 2015 UTC,"Adderal, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Ad-der-al: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Ad. Der. Al."
StudentNurse,380qjp,grg46,5,Mon Jun 1 03:36:53 2015 UTC,"She was beans in the streets and dextroamphetamine on the dotted line, but in my hands and under my tongue she was always Adderall."
StudentNurse,380qjp,kthxdots,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:22:32 2015 UTC,Going to the doctor and straight up asking for a prescription for Adderall for my accelerated second degree BSN program was the best thing I think I did. Shit helps so much.
StudentNurse,380qjp,kthxdots,-4,Mon Jun 1 14:34:11 2015 UTC,Wow I hope I never get any of you speed freaks as nurses. I haven't needed adderall. Learning how to manage your time without cheating is day one nursing.
StudentNurse,380qjp,562dreezy,2,Mon Jun 1 18:38:12 2015 UTC,"Not planning on getting a rx for it, but I don't think taking something to help you focus could be considered cheating by any means."
StudentNurse,380qjp,kthxdots,-6,Mon Jun 1 20:39:03 2015 UTC,"If youre taking a drug that you aren't prescribed for the express purpose of getting an edge over other students then yes, that is the definition of cheating. All the Adderall in the world won't help you pass those NCLEX ethics questions I guess."
StudentNurse,380qjp,kthxdots,6,Mon Jun 1 22:15:47 2015 UTC,I drink coffee to get an edge Over students. That's not cheating. Stop being so close minded.
StudentNurse,380qjp,562dreezy,-7,Tue Jun 2 00:59:17 2015 UTC,Is coffee prescribed by a doctor? Is coffee a controlled substance that you are perjuring yourself to obtain?
StudentNurse,380qjp,Mri1004a,3,Tue Jun 2 11:58:27 2015 UTC,Who says any of these people are lying to get it?  You are jumping to some serious conclusions.   I seriously feel like you have no room to make assumptions about people just because they got prescription for adderall. Get off your high horse. It's not like these people are meeting a guy in an alley to score meds.
StudentNurse,380qjp,macavity_is_a_dog,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:06:00 2015 UTC,"No one in this thread thanked Adderall for helping them overcome their diagnosed ADD/ADHD.   Going to the doctor and straight up asking for a prescription for Adderall for my accelerated second degree BSN program was the best thing I think I did. Shit helps so much.   If you need Adderall to succeed in nursing school, what are you going to do when you graduate and you actually start the real nursing? Keep taking Adderall? It's not a high-horse thing. It's an ethical thing. It's also the legal thing. Quit trying to pawn off your poor ethical considerations on me. I know what's right, and taking Schedule II stimulants that treat a disorder you don't have to do better at anything is wrong. Plain and simple. If you are taking Adderall and you don't have a diagnosis and a prescription, it's wrong and illegal. Cultivate your own study habits and your own time management skills. There are 10-15 students in my nursing class who run an ""Adderall study group"" and you know what? They are terrible at clinicals. One of them double-dosed my patient with potassium, so excuse me if I think it's a big deal. Adderall is not a study aid, it is a Schedule II stimulant (in the same class as cocaine and methamphetamine) and is dangerous if used without the supervision of a physician. How are you going to advocate for patient safety when you yourself are sweeping my legitimate ethical concerns under the rug?"
StudentNurse,380qjp,Henessey123,4,Tue Jun 2 15:50:03 2015 UTC,I bet your the type of person who discriminates IV drug users when they come into ur ED.
StudentNurse,380qjp,kinjaninja,2,Tue Jun 2 22:18:57 2015 UTC,"You definitely have valid points, however you did not share your concern for patient safety or any stories about your peers prior to calling these people spreed freaks and liars. You jumped to a lot of conclusions. Adderall is abused, there's no denying that but for every person you've had a bad experience with who is abusing the drug, there are actually people who need it and it's unfair to lump those people in with recreational users or drug abusers.   Just because she didn't sing its praises in helping with her ADHD doesn't mean that's not what she was using it for."
StudentNurse,380qjp,doppleganger88,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:45:28 2015 UTC,I'm late to this post but I completely agree with everything you have said and I have no idea why you're being down voted. I was diagnosed by a therapist of having adhd but I never went to a psychiatrist to be put on mess. Have I struggled in nursing school? Yes. But I'm also in my last semester with b's and a's. Lots of people in my program take adderall and they don't put in the work I so and manage to get straight A's. To see the top post on here be adderall is really disappointing!!!

StudentNurse,380qjp,Pumpkin214,2,Mon Jun 1 05:19:21 2015 UTC,I definitely agree and follow along in the book with what you're learning in class
StudentNurse,380qjp,DrinkUpGorgeous,8,Mon Jun 1 20:44:18 2015 UTC,"A good agenda. I need one where I can see the whole month at once.

StudentNurse,380qjp,silvercornfeild,3,Mon Jun 1 12:03:44 2015 UTC,SECOND THIS!!!  I spent $700 renting books my first semester of nursing classes and didn't open them once!
StudentNurse,380qjp,Pumpkin214,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:29:54 2015 UTC,"I spent $1000 my first semester and NEVER opened a single book. I bought a 2-volume med surg book 2 semesters ago because they said we'd DEFINITELY need it, and we'd use it again for this semester. Well, this semester they are of course ""requiring"" a new book that's over $300. I'm sure the med surg book from 2 semesters ago will be just fine, and I didn't even take the plastic wrapper off of it the semester I bought it, so I'm doubting I'll even use it this semester."
StudentNurse,380qjp,CherryDaBomb,3,Mon Jun 1 16:23:47 2015 UTC,Ive used almost every text book ive bought for all my classes in the program. while there are lots of resources online id be a little wary about swearing them off for good
StudentNurse,380qjp,Savmame100,2,Mon Jun 1 14:32:42 2015 UTC,"I don't even use online. I find that professors always cover what is going to be on an exam in class. I take fantastic notes and I record all lectures and re-listen to them constantly. I'm a senior and a dean's list student and I have not opened a single text book. I'm not trying to brag, I just feel like I wasted a lot of money my first few semesters, and I have succeeded without textbooks. I know many of my peers stress out because there is SO much in the books and they focus on things we never even covered and wind up not doing as well as they could have if they had just focused on what was covered in class."
StudentNurse,380qjp,shareberry,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:31:27 2015 UTC,"Would you recommend going to the first class and getting a feel for the program, then buying what I think is necessary?"
StudentNurse,380qjp,Tylorian_delorean,2,Mon Jun 1 17:26:40 2015 UTC,"Yes. I bought a book that was on the list. First day in class, the prof goes ""well, you should have it, but you don't need it"".  Ask upper year students. Plenty are bitter enough to remember which books they used a footstool, and which they used for more than one class.  Also, the library (both public and school) has way more textbooks than one would think."
StudentNurse,380qjp,thanatophiliam,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:18:54 2015 UTC,"I definitely think this is a good strategy. I started renting (except for the med surg book they said we'd need for 2 classes) because I always feel guilty and like there MIGHT be something I need, but honestly I have never opened a book my entire nursing school career. I just focus on taking good notes, really paying attention in class, and recording the lectures so I can re-listen to them. It has seriously worked so well for me.   It really depends on what type of learner you are, too. If you find that reading the content from the text helps, then maybe you'll want to get the books. Trying to read from the text makes me fall asleep and just has too much content that we don't need for exams, hence why I just take good notes and re-listen to lectures!"
StudentNurse,380qjp,aleibrock,2,Mon Jun 1 17:35:28 2015 UTC,"I definitely prefer to have the physical book, even 2 (somewhat useless) degrees later I'm still a real-book purist. But something I noticed during school is just that just because the course lists the book as necessary, that doesn't mean it actually is. So I started waiting until the first night of class and feeling it out, and then opting for whatever I thought was necessary. Never failed me once, so naturally I'm wanting to do that again in nursing school."
StudentNurse,380qjp,olov244,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:41:24 2015 UTC,Did you keep any of your books?  Trying to decide if there are any I should purchase instead of rent so I can reference them later if I need to.
StudentNurse,380qjp,MaroonKiwi,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:07:04 2015 UTC,"What until the first day of class of you can. Honestly I have used every single book. My medsurg book looks like hell with all of the scribbling and highlighting. My teachers also don't put everything in PowerPoint and I find it hard to keep up with notes in class. So I'd bring my book to class and highlight what they said.  My professors always say ""use the PowerPoint as a guide, but you are responsible for the chapters in the book""  TLDR: Depends on your program, ask any nursing students you know that are ahead of you, especially on any local Facebook book selling pages!  Edit: I've kept all mine except Psych, however my medsurg book is the only one I ever really open"

Since starting clinicals last semester, I print monthly calendars and write out every test and assignment.   It also would have been very helpful to get my full drivers licence + a car and lived at home. Unfortunately my school is far from my parents home. But having a car would make things a lot easier. For example, it takes me 1 to 1.5 h to travel to school whereas with a car it would take me 15 minutes. Plus having to be at clinical at 6am is hectic when there are no buses running between 4-5am to get there."

And I wish I knew that it's a lot of work but it's really not as hard as people make it out to be. You don't need adderall or drugs. Just study and understand the material. Pay attention in class, that's where you learn. Then go and review the notes."

As someone who's been in the workforce for a few years, a boxed lunch is way more economical than going and grabbing some fast food!

StudentNurse,37yz0a,Generoh,10,Sun May 31 16:22:35 2015 UTC,"The best way is really to not give it, instead give D10 or D12.5 IVPB as it's less caustic to the veins.  However, if you're giving it I usually just use the syringe (the blue box with 25g) and push it slowly while the IV is running wide open.  I will also stop once the patient is starting to wake up, and then give it in small boluses until the patient is alert enough to take PO food.  That helps to avoid the wild glucose swings you can see if you give the entire amp and it a little nicer on the veins."
StudentNurse,37yz0a,justatouchcrazy,3,Sun May 31 18:13:08 2015 UTC,"In emerg we give it push, my unit doesn't have it in any other form but pre loaded syringes made specifically for pushing (although you could add to an IV bag from there). In all honesty if your patient is not lucid enough to take PO and their sugar is critically low, you need to push it and not waste time. Check your policy for push rates though."
StudentNurse,37yz0a,beautifulbitterfruit,1 point,Sun May 31 18:33:18 2015 UTC,For hyperkalemia I'd say push for sure. For hypoglycemia.... I'd say IV bolus   My best advice actually is follow hospital protocol. D50 push might be a no no at some places.   Ask them in nursing.. They are the pros.

Can you walk me through the process from the time you walk through the door at the testing center to the time you walk out?   I went in, checked in at the front desk.  They took ID, I think that's when we did the palm scan, I shut down my phone and put all my belongings in a locker.  They were fine with me popping out to use the restroom before going in.  They called us back one at a time, they check you over to make sure you aren't smuggling in anything, including looking in the hood of my sweatshirt.  She said she liked that I was wearing running tights because it made it easy :)  There was a rule that my sweatshirt was ok, but if I took it off it had to come out and go in my locker, no hanging it on my chair.  She took me into the room and sat me at a computer.  There were headphones, but I don't ever remember using them.  They gave me earplugs (can't use your own), and a whiteboard (don't write anything until you've started.  Not allowed to brain dump.).  Also, they record you taking the test on video apparently, so I got a quick glimpse of myself from a really unattractive angle at one point but then you don't see it the whole time.  It stops for a break every two hours, but you can opt out of it.  You can also take a break any time you want by raising your hand and they'll take you out then do the whole palm scan/check your hoodie thing on the way back in, but everyone was super nice about it.  I made it a point to stop every ten questions or so and stretch my neck and do a few deep breaths, and I got up twice just for water and a little moving around in the hall.  Once you're done, the test shuts off and it tells you you're done and then you answer a couple survey questions I think. Then I think you raise your hand again and they come get you and then you just get your stuff from the locker and head out.     What kind of questions were the majority?    I don't remember having an overwhelming majority in any one subject, it seemed pretty well rounded.  I remember having three EKG-related questions all based on the same rhythm, so I just shot for being consistent in my interpretation and hoped for the best.     Which drugs do you remember being questioned about? Does it ask by class (ie beta blockers, antidepressants, etc) or does it give specific drugs? If specific, does NCLEX use generic or trade names?   I remember some heart drugs I think (those damn EKG questions), and a fair few that I wasn't even positive what they were.  They're all generic names, no more trade names at all, so what was most helpful to me was knowing the endings of the classes and having a general idea of what they'd treat, main side effects, and significant adverse effects specific to that class.  I felt like I was able to guess with reasonable confidence.   Is NCLEX anything like ATI?   I think ATI was a pretty decent approximation.  Nothing's going to be an exact replica, but having done ATI was helpful in preparing.   What did you use to study? Do you think it helped? What do you recommend?   ATI in school.  I bought the Saunders book because I wanted more content review, and read through the subjects and did both the questions in the book and online.  I didn't make it through all of it because I only studied about 2-3 weeks and am an in-depth reader so it was slow going.  I do think it was really helpful though because there was plenty I'd forgotten.  I also think going back over my old pathophys/pharm notes and old case studies helped because sometimes reading the Saunders felt like learning it for the first time all over, whereas reading familiar notes did more to job my memory of what I already knew.  Saunders also has three audio reviews that come with the online resources and I thought the pharm one was especially helpful (pharm was never my strong subject).  I also did some Kaplan questions and found their decision-making tree quite helpful (my friend had it so we swapped).  I would have liked to try that NCLEX RN app, because I like being able to flip through a couple questions here and there on my phone rather than sitting down for three hour blocks, but my phone was too old and didn't support it  :)  In general, I think you need to evaluate if you need to focus on test-taking, like how to strategize and answer NCLEX-style questions, or if you need more content review.  I did a little of both, but I definitely focused on content because I'm a pretty good test taker in general and never struggled with NCLEX formatting.    The other advice I think is key is to trust yourself.  Most of the preparation you already did throughout school.  You have a lot of knowledge so you have to trust in it.  And no matter how prepared you are, you will probably feel like shit when you're actually taking the test.  That EKG was my first question and I was like, ""well shit, if I have to guess on the first question, I'm screwed.""  But all my friends said they felt like they were failing the whole time, and walked out certain they'd failed, so I just kept telling myself, ""It feels this bad for everyone.""  And we all passed in 75.  It's not supposed to feel good, so don't let it pysch you out because you're probably doing better than you feel you are.    Good luck!"
StudentNurse,37wtn3,gin_and_uterotonic,4,Sun May 31 03:43:29 2015 UTC,Definitely knowing drug endings helped know drugs....I got lucky and only got a few and actually knew the ones I got. Finished in 78 questions and didn't get a lot of select all that apply but I did get a lot of exhibit ones and put this in order. After I took it I saw a friend's Kaplan qbank and those questions looked very similar. I actually saw one question that was almost exactly like one I had on nclex. And just fyi.....you will most likely feel like you failed when you leave that's totally normal. I came out feeling like I had no idea how I did or how I could have even passed.
StudentNurse,37wtn3,bwirth2,2,Sun May 31 16:49:51 2015 UTC,"I just graduated with a BSN and the school I went used ATI in its courses.  I can say that I did not study as much as I wanted to for the NCLEX, but I passed first try.  I took the test on May 29 2015 and had 78 questions.  My philosophy going into it was that if the last 4 years of school has not helped me pass this test on the first try, than I would seek extra help. I am glad that I did not pay for additional help.  The NCLEX only has generic drug names and you can get a range of questions, from maternal to community.  I firmly believe that if you can nail 65% on ATI quizzes/practice tests than you will be perfectly fine for the NCLEX.  Just relax and follow your gut.  I used ATI.  I just spent the days before the test going thought the practice tests in ATI and then took the NLCEX final test that they have.  Make sure to read all of the rationales, even on the questions you got right. If you feel like you only got 4 questions right.  That is normal.  I actually walked out and realized that I missed both math questions, due to a silly mistake.  So do not panic if you feel as though you did not do well."
StudentNurse,37wtn3,KissedbyFire__,2,Mon Jun 1 16:04:09 2015 UTC,"Looks like I'm a few days late for this but I'll answer anyway.     Walked in, gave my ID, read a form, signed it, gave my palm scans, and locked my stuff up in a locker.  Then I was sent back to a woman who told me the set up of my computer/headphones and gave me earplugs and a whiteboard (for working out problems).  When I went in, I sat down and did the NCLEX ""here's the style of questions you might get!"" thing.  That took about 5 minutes.  Then my test started. I had 107 questions and I took an hour and 20 minutes.  15 were select all that apply.  My test didn't focus on any particular areas, and I only had 2 or 3 math questions.  They varied in difficulty, and didn't get steadily harder or steadily easier.  I had very few delegation problems and no Maslow problems.  Many were about priority tasks or patients. Drugs were asked by generic or trade name for me.  It rarely (if ever) said what class they were in.   I thought the NCLEX was more vague than ATI.  ATI was more specific in wording the questions.   I used ATI.  I took the predictor once and it said I had a 75% chance of passing the NCLEX on my first try.  I was almost to the point where I would take it again when I decided, ""Screw it! 75% is good enough for me!"" So I took the NCLEX and passed.  ATI definitely helped me.   So...I finished my test, raised my hand, and a woman came and got me.  I scanned my palm and went to get my stuff from my locker, and then I went home. That's all!"

StudentNurse,37xcb4,CalvinsStuffedTiger,2,Sun May 31 04:34:38 2015 UTC,"Love this idea! I have a few concerns as a new grad...  For one... I'm starting in the neuro ICU, so that in itself freaks me out. High acuity, so much to learn, always a lot going on with each patient; my orientation is long, so hopefully I'll feel better once I start and get through all of that, but I'm definitely nervous about adjusting to this specialty.  Also freaked out about my 45 minute commute + twelve hour shifts. I've never had such long days before! I'm working days, at least, but I think I'm still going to be pretty worn out.  Also... codes. Can't lie, I'm scared for my first. I've seen how well the staff comes together on my floor because I saw them deal with a patient who had extubated himself when I was there to shadow. They are a great team, so I'm sure I'll feel better once I've been a part of a code, but I'm definitely nervous about it.  Thanks for the thread. :)"
StudentNurse,37xcb4,kayten88,2,Sun May 31 04:51:36 2015 UTC,"Wow, you are really going for it as a new grad! Haha.    I can't speak too much about the ICU as I've never worked there, and to be honest, working in the ICU really scared me too! (but don't tell my friends/co-workers I said that).    RE: Codes, for me, the fear was that I wouldn't know what to do, and that it would lead to someone dying.    The reality is...I dont know what to do (lol), but it didn't lead to someone dying, because I utilized my resources.  My advice would be the first bunch of times a code blue is called on your unit, run over there and volunteer to be the recorder.  Someone has to do it every time, and no one really likes to do it.   For me it was a great way to be involved, to be a helpful member of the team, and to be able to absorb what the flow of the code was, what each member of the team was doing, where the equipment was located, and which drawers the drugs were located in (important to memorize).    People kinda made fun of me after awhile because I was ALWAYS recording during codes, but I didn't really care because getting made fun of was the far better option than being unprepared as a critical member of the team.  After my shifts I would write down in a notebook with the title of the post ""W.I.L.T."" a.k.a. What I Learned Today  My Notebook of Choice to carry in the hospital are the Moleskin Pocket Notebooks  I did this mostly because my memory is terrible, and I wanted to remember the key concepts, terms, drugs, etc. that I was confused about during the day.    Once I was home and not sleep-deprived I could look up the terms and learn about it with a clear head not overloaded with caffeine and adrenaline.  RE: Commute.  I Do have a lot to say about this.    Personal anecdote: I used to work night shift and I lived 30 minutes away, 40 minutes with traffic, which I was STUCK IN EVERY F@#(*$&ING DAY.    Being stuck in bumper to bumper traffic after a brutal 12-hour shift (or more if you had to stay overtime to finish charting/writing incident reports/etc.) IS DANGEROUS.   I fell asleep at the wheel dozens of times, and it scared the shit out of me.  I read a study once that sneezing while driving at 65mph makes you travel 300 feet with your eyes closed.  What distance do you think you travel when you fall asleep?    Even worse, I had a friend on the floor who actually totaled her car falling asleep at the wheel while commuting over an hour away after her shift.  She escaped without injuries thank god, but it could have been worse, and it could have hurt someone else.   On top of that, if you are doing back to back 12s, or back to back to back 12s, you are so tired that you end up in a position where you start thinking, ""Do I drink caffeine to make it home alive?  What do I do if I can't go to sleep when I get home?  Well I guess I could take benadryl...But then I'm going to be really groggy when I wake up in a few hours...But I guess I could just drink more caffeine....""   And so on and so forth...It's a really, really, slippery and unhealthy slope.    Do you really have to commute 45 minutes? What are the reasons you are commuting so far? and are they REALLY that important when considering everything?   If the health risks aren't enough, the economics of a long commute are terrible.  Here is a MrMoneyMustache Blog Post on The True Cost of Commuting   The TL;DR of it can be summed up by one statement in it ""In other words, a logical person should be willing to pay about $15,900 more for a house that is one mile closer to work, and $477,000 more for a house that is 30 miles closer to work. For a double-commuting couple, these numbers are $31,800 and $954,000.""  Hopefully my ranting post helps a bit, and I hope there are some ICU nurses that can chime in about working in the unit, I would love to hear about what tools you guys use to cope with your department psychologically."
StudentNurse,37xcb4,ajh1717,2,Sun May 31 05:19:13 2015 UTC,"Being a recorder with zero code experience is a really bad idea.  The recorder needs to know what is going on, what ACLS calls for, what is due when, and keep everyone on track. They are the ones who will most likely be noting when the next epi/shock/whatever is due.  When you have your first code, just jump on the chest. CPR is easy enough and you will get comfortable with code situations."
StudentNurse,37xcb4,interviewrn,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:30:01 2015 UTC,"If you can't get on the chest, you should be a 2nd recorder. Someone with more experience should definitely be doing it, but you can do it too (a good way to learn the algorithms first hand!)"
StudentNurse,37xcb4,kayten88,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:05:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the thoughtful response! I really appreciate the input. I know... This position is going to be tough as a new grad, but I think the environment of the floor and the hospital make it more conducive to my learning than maybe other similar floors would be. The nurse manager is wonderful and the staff seem to be as well. Seven additional full-time positions were added to the floor last year, so they have had several new grads start since then, and all have done great, so I feel okay about it!  As far as the commute... I had an offer at a hospital five minutes from home. It was hard to turn down. That hospital, however, is a community hospital that is struggling a lot. It is most likely going to be bought out soon, which concerned me. The floor I would have worked on has a very high turnover rate because it's constantly so understaffed. Five nurses started there in January and all left before their orientation ended. I didn't feel safe working there knowing all this. Also, my orientation would have only been 8 weeks long. I get five months at my ICU job.   My husband and I bought our home just a year ago and won't be able to move closer to my hospital for at least a year, probably longer. One good thing, at least, is I have a few friends who will be working at this hospital and making the same commute, so we will at least sometimes carpool! There are lots of commuters from my town to this hospital, actually... It's worth it, in a sense."

I ended up scoring pretty nicely on it (about a 90), but I already had a foundation in taking A&P and Sci courses. Not sure how much that actually helped since ATI is literally straight memorization and some simple (may not be for you, though) math and calculations. English section is about discerning what you are looking for in the text.  That's about all I can think of right now, though."
StudentNurse,37wbo4,RaidenGG,1 point,Sun May 31 03:32:04 2015 UTC,I bought the Saunders TEAS V study guide. It was extremely helpful. I highly recommend it. It was all I needed to study for the exam. :)  Good luck!
StudentNurse,37wbo4,Derparita,1 point,Sun May 31 01:02:40 2015 UTC,I would get the study guide provided by ATI and get the package that comes with the book and the practice tests.  That should be enough preparation.
StudentNurse,37wbo4,annastar,1 point,Sun May 31 02:29:12 2015 UTC,Get the ATI testing book and I would also recommend taking a practice test on the ATI testing website. It'll give you the best idea of how you're going to do on the actual TEAS.
StudentNurse,37vdtw,udntsay,3,Sat May 30 18:42:50 2015 UTC,"That is a really tough call. I hear you. I recommend going straight for your BSN, because you will need it, and I think you will have a better chance of getting hired as a new nurse, over a candidate with only an ASN, even if they did graduate from a community college with a great program. I say that as someone who is about to graduate with an ASN. I will be going back very soon to get my BSN."

StudentNurse,37vdtw,DanKC,1 point,Sat May 30 20:10:33 2015 UTC,"Usually there is not a difference in pay initially, but you will need a BSN to be promoted most of the time. Some hospitals give bonuses for BSNs or pay incentives but I think that is based on location."

StudentNurse,37vdtw,DanKC,2,Sun May 31 04:12:09 2015 UTC,"I would start by plotting out both programs semester by semester, in my experience many two year programs are really three so you might not save as much time as you think. If I were starting over again I would probably apply for both and go the BSN route, but dont turn up your nose at the ADN if it becomes the only choice.  a BSN gives you more immediate options and would mean that you could at least apply for positions in bigger cities, I know in man places its harder to get hospital jobs with a ADN and no experience these days, also school nurses and public health usually require a BSN.  As far as the physicians thinking the community college prepares better nurses, I would take it with a grain of salt. What they say may be true but its also not the whole picture. RNs are supposed to be more than technicians and do more critical thinking/problem solving."
StudentNurse,37vdtw,MydoglookslikeanEwok,1 point,Sat May 30 20:20:10 2015 UTC,"What DanKC said is correct. The Associate Degree of Nursing is about three years, when you factor in pre-requisites."
StudentNurse,37vdtw,iSnuggelz,2,Sat May 30 21:17:23 2015 UTC,"I highly advise you to consider a BS in Nursing. In most urban areas, hospitals are beginning to phase out Associates Nurses and people that come from technical nursing schools. As of now, while there are still lots of rural/suburban places that still hire Associate's nurses, it probably won't be that way in the future.  If you are young and plan on staying in the field for several decades, I highly advise you to go the safe route and get a BS. As of now, there is a strong possibility that associates positions will be phased out/less available.   I'm in NYC and all the hospitals in the 5 boroughs only hire RNs with BS degrees."
StudentNurse,37vdtw,CalvinsStuffedTiger,2,Sat May 30 21:21:03 2015 UTC,"BSN if at all possible.   Many hospitals (any who are magnet or striving to achieve magnet status,  which is everyone else)  are ONLY hiring BSNs to balance out their percentage of BSN to ADN statistics.   The only reason you shouldn't is if the wait list for a BSN program is way longer than an ADN OR if you can't afford it.   If you have to go the ADN route I would first make sure that a local University has an RN-BSN program.   Then I would find a local hospital that I wouldn't mind working at, get a job as a tech or unit secretary or janitor,  and work there while I got my ADN.    Shown them you are a hard worker and tell the director you are in nursing school and want to work there in the future.     After you get your ADN you can work there while you attend the RN-BSN program.   Due to many hospitals offering tuition reimbursement this could potentially be the cheapest way to get a BSN if economics are an issue.   This path will be very long and very challenging though because you will have to work long enough hours to qualify for the benefits while going through nursing school which will be very very difficult."
StudentNurse,37vdtw,MissSomething,1 point,Sat May 30 21:28:05 2015 UTC,Next semester I am taking a CNA course. Its mandatory in order to get your ADN. So I am thinking of becoming a certified CNA and working as a CNA until I hit Nursing School. I'm starting to think I will just go and apply to the University and if its a long wait then I will do the ADN to BSN route.
StudentNurse,37vdtw,macavity_is_a_dog,2,Tue Jun 2 00:22:37 2015 UTC,"I am in a similar situation as you. I decided to go for my ASN so I could start working since we wil be moving shortly after I graduate(would have had to transfer schools if I did BSN). Plus, the BSN programs by me are extremely competitive and I probably Wouldn't have been accepted because of a bad academic year. I plan on doing a bridge program to BSN. Many universities offer this program in 3-4 semesters and a lot of them you can take on line and the only physical thing to go to are a few clinicals. Some employers may pay for you to get your BSN as well. The choice is yours but just weigh the pros and cons"

StudentNurse,37vdtw,DanKC,3,Mon Jun 1 02:24:43 2015 UTC,What I would do is look into near by universities and see if they have a RN-BSN ladder program. You apply after you have finished your associates RN and it's a year program that's mostly online and you can do while you work as an RN. BSN is really going to be the new standard for nurses from what I hear so definitely pursue it.
StudentNurse,37vdtw,dandelion_k,1 point,Sat May 30 18:55:11 2015 UTC,"If your area isn't super saturated, by all means go for an ADN at a community college, work for a year, and let your employer pay your tuition for an RN to BSN. It's not only the most cost effective way to do things, but you'll typically get more 1 on 1 time with teachers at a smaller school, and you'll be gaining experience while you finish your degree. Locally, our community colleges and trade schools have much better NCLEX pass rates than the big state university."

StudentNurse,37vdtw,Derpetite,1 point,Sat May 30 20:09:50 2015 UTC,You should also make sure local hospitals are actually offering tuition reimbursement. Now that the market is more balanced (flooded) alot of places don't give nearly the perks they used to.
StudentNurse,37vdtw,DanKC,1 point,Sat May 30 20:15:02 2015 UTC,"You can finish an RN to BSN in a year (if thats what you meant by ""two more years into three"". If I hadn't taken a term off, mine would've taken me 12 months. Even with my area being fairly saturated (7 nursing schools), all major hospitals are offering tuition reimbursement because having more bachelor prepared nurses looks good. Hell, my own employer runs a BSN school affiliated with its hospitals (no ADN option), and still offers tuition reimbursement for ADN nurses to get their BSN."
StudentNurse,37vdtw,Derpetite,1 point,Sat May 30 22:04:53 2015 UTC,You could get your ASN and start working as a nurse if establishments near you will hire nurses with two year degrees. A lot of schools have online BSN programs that allow you to work and go to school. That's my plan at least.   Many larger hospitals are going on magnet programs and making it mandatory that you have your BSN. It's worth it to do it now   Edit: another thing to consider is a lot of schools have programs that are a little shorter if you already have your ASN and are getting your BSN bridge. Definitely look in to it.
StudentNurse,37vdtw,willamsweave,1 point,Sat May 30 22:14:39 2015 UTC,"Whenever I read about nursing in the U.S. I'm always shocked by how there seems to be too many different entry routes with completely different training methods. Like doesn't it get confusing with so many different skill levels?   Here in the UK it's one route now. You do the bachelors degree, 3 years, it's 50% theory in lecture theatres or seminars and 50% practical by doing placements in places like hospitals, clinics, hospices.. All of which are organised by the university and audited. You have to complete a certain amount of hours, meet requirements and competencies and only then will the nursing council allow you to register.   I have to say though from what I've seen it seems that you guys have to learn a lot more than we do.   I madr a tumblr directory of nurses and I found it so hard to list who were nurses and who weren't because I had no idea what your qualifications meant ha"
StudentNurse,37vdtw,vigor145,1 point,Sat May 30 22:36:04 2015 UTC,"So the easiest way to look at it is to separate licensure/scope of practice from education.   All LPN programs are certificate at least in my area and are usually taught at trade schools but regardless of education all LPNs have the same scope of practice.  All RNs have the same scope of practice regardless of education, diploma (rare), associates (less than 50%), bachelors (most common for new grads) and MSN generalists (less common and always second degree/career students).   At the advanced practice level CRNA/NP all new grads need a MS/MSN some old NPs may just have BSNs but that is very rare.

Quality critical care work experience (ccrn helps a ton!), recommendations, and interview actually weigh in a whole lot more than GPA alone. In fact, the gpa that truly matters is the hard sciences gpa like patho, pharm, bio, orgo, chem, statistics, physics - crna programs really only care about these few classes, and it makes sense too. This is a profession that heavily relies on understanding of most of these scientific principles. The other nursing theory courses not so much. As long as you ""pass"" them. Good luck :)"

StudentNurse,37o5u5,mermaid_93,8,Fri May 29 02:10:50 2015 UTC,Clinicals scare the shit out of me because I watch the real nurses go about their days and I wonder how the hell they know what they're doing? It stresses me out because I feel like I don't know anything and I never know what to do next. But the nurses that I've talked to say you learn the most once you get your first job. So I'm sticking with it until the end and hoping that's the case.
StudentNurse,37o5u5,mcslootysloot,5,Fri May 29 02:30:13 2015 UTC,"I actually had quite a bit of anxiety when dealing with patients. I'm naturally a shy person, so there were multiple times when I would stand in front of their doors, just terrified to go in.   So my biggest thing was learning how to get over it, so I actually took a job up as a CNA to get over my fear. Basically, I have forced myself to interact, to deal with stuff that terrified me, and to learn everything that I thought I couldn't.   Doing that has helped me tremendously, as I've worked over a year there now and I've dealt with so much. I'm not afraid to interact with patients anymore and I have quite a bit more confidence compared to before.   Biggest thing I can say, go where you are comfortable. If you still want nursing, think about becoming a nursing assistant or shadowing others. If anything, it will help to boost your confidence and give you the push to what you want.   Is the reason why you had anxiety because you're afraid of the potential problems that you 'may' or 'may not' cause?"
StudentNurse,37o5u5,miloblue12,1 point,Fri May 29 03:17:19 2015 UTC,"I have always suffered from anxiety, but going into school has escalated it. Going into the unknown is very terrifying for me. My mind is so scrambled on a daily basis, I have a hard time staying on track thus making me scared of making mistakes. One of my instructors picked up on my anxiety and threatened failing me the entire clinical. He basically told me I wouldn't make it, and its stuck with me ever since."
StudentNurse,37o5u5,destroyingtocreate,2,Fri May 29 03:31:16 2015 UTC,"I had difficult instructors who had that ""tough love"" approach and even wrote me up - gave me a ""warning"" for being slow on assessments and charting - meaning, if I didn't get my shit together and show improvement, they weren't going to pass me for the clinical portion. I was like ""omg, I'm new, I'm a little nervous, I'm trying to be thorough... what the hell?!"" I guess I ended up doing better cause she didn't fail me.  But, as someone who's been there and done that - I understand that praise and encouragement often go a lot further than pointing out only weaknesses and threatening to fail a student over the weaknesses.   If a student is struggling, a good instructor would would first pick up on your anxiety, bring it to your attention - then help you/work with you to overcome it.   However, part of this is your responsibility as well - if in your first semester you recognized your anxiety was a problem, you should have reached out to an instructor or an RN for help. If your assessments took ""forever"" you should ask a nurse or instructor to do them with you, or show you how they would do it. And IF you forget something - which, by the way, does happen! - it's fine - cause you're gonna be assessing them throughout the day!   And as far as checking your meds 10 times - I never gave meds alone in clinical - ever, it just wasn't allowed. Either my instructor was with me, or the RN was. And if either one of them saw me doing that, they would have asked me wtf I was doing and informed me that we don't have time for that.. the RN would have taken them from me and given them the meds themselves and the instructor would have marked me as ""unsure, incompetent"" or something ... so ... just out of curiosity, when did you ever have time to check your meds 10 times?   TL;DR So, all of that said, work on your anxiety .. get some medication if you need to or aren't already taking some. And if you like nursing and want to do it, there are all kinds of things you can do other than being in a hospital.. you can work in a dr.'s office, you can teach, you can be a school nurse, you can do research, you can help write nursing books, you can be a legal nurse consultant, you can work in management, the list is really quite endless - nursing school is not full-scope. Just get the license - there's so much you can do with it!"
StudentNurse,37o5u5,destroyingtocreate,2,Fri May 29 16:05:12 2015 UTC,"In my school, there are certain things we could not do alone like changing IV bags or SC/IM injections for instance. However, the first time we were to give PO meds we had to show our instructor how we were able to calculate dosages, verbalize the rights of med admin and do our checks. After this was approved, we were given the OK do it alone unless it was a narcotic. Then we had to get co-signs and whatnot before it could be given."
StudentNurse,37o5u5,miloblue12,2,Fri May 29 17:03:20 2015 UTC,"Right, we had co-signing also - with the co-sign, someone had to be there to witness what we did. So, it was never alone - the instructor wasn't there, but an RN was. To get the meds out of the Pyxis, the nurse had to use their login to get them out for us - then we'd go to the patient's room, and we had a student log-in on the computer charting system, which required the nurse to sign off after we had scanned all the meds. So basically, they had to be there.   I'm not saying I don't believe you, just telling you how we did it.  But bottom line - if you want to do nursing, you're young, you can still do it. Get the help you need for your anxiety and get back in the game. :)"
StudentNurse,37o5u5,potted_petunias,2,Fri May 29 18:03:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the way your school does med admin is very reassuring.. I wish mine did that! We had our own login to the system and were responsible for recording it all. Thanks for your support :)"
StudentNurse,37o5u5,Ash_ash,1 point,Fri May 29 18:29:45 2015 UTC,"Nursing is scary, trust me, and it's reasonable to be that way. I hope more than anything that if nursing is truly what you want, that you find a reliable resource to get your anxiety managed.   A couple things that I can tell you for sure is that there will always be a lot of unknown with nursing. Heck, I'm going into my senior year, have completed 5 clinicals and worked a year as a nursing assistant, and I still have no idea what to expect when I'm finally a nurse. The whole point of nursing school is to build this safety net of knowledge so that when you do venture from school, you finally learn how to be a nurse but can pull resources and previous knowledge from school. However, school will not teach you the paperwork, time management, how to deal with crazy patients or bosses. It's a huge learning curve and the best thing to do is to realize this and do the best to prepare yourself.   Next thing, don't be scared. The greatest thing about nursing is that there are SO many different paths to take. You don't have to end up in a hospital, you can literally go anywhere that might help in dealing with your anxiety. The other good thing? Nursing for the most part has been set up that it's difficult to make a mistake. Yes, it's really smart to be aware of your medications, that's great. However, that dressing change? You're not going to kill your patient if it's not done correctly.   Last thing, for all that is good, do not listen to your listen clinical instructors...I mean do, but if they put you down like that, screw them. Same goes for everyone else you meet while in school and into a career in nursing. Surround yourself with people that will support you and will help you as much as possible. I've got a few buddies who I adore and we've been together for going on 4 years. When they were down, I helped picked them up and calm their fears and they have done the exact same for me. If we ever had an instructor put us down (it does happen), then we pick ourselves up and continue on but we figure out how to better ourselves.   If your heart is really into it, the nursing world could definitely use someone like you. Seek out some help at your school or somewhere else and hopefully they can help you learn how to manage your anxiety. I seriously wish the best for you!"
StudentNurse,37o5u5,reefshadow,3,Fri May 29 04:05:25 2015 UTC,"I had to walk away from the direction of my bachelor's due to anxiety. I'm in nursing school now after having spent a decade out of college, with much more self-awareness.   First of all, I'm sure you're hearing this plenty, but it's okay to quit, and to quit for years. And you may never go back. And that's okay. I'm in school with a bunch of other people my age and older, and we're all happy and motivated and totally not too old for a career change - in fact, 5 career changes is the current average in today's society.   To deal with my anxiety during school the first time, I self-medicated. A lot. Then I had to go through addiction recovery. So at least you didn't go that way!  Since that period, I've done a lot to get to my root issues around anxiety. Recovery work was the very beginning. When I was ready, I went into psychotherapy for the long haul, and also started going to a good therapy group. And I found a lot of activities that are both fun but also are potential triggers for anxiety - so basically constant exposure to my triggers so I can work though them. I discovered in my city an anxiety research dept at the local university, and went through that. It was essentially CBT-style treatment, and it was highly effective. I found it to be complementary to my psychotherapy, because I like to attack issues from all sides.   Ultimately, I've learned the human mind is more malleable than I ever thought. It may take time, but behaviors and personalities can change. Being able to question oneself and wanting what's best for the patient are wonderful qualities for a nurse to have. So the big question for you might be, how do I take these traits of mine and develop them into healthier traits?  I also do 10-day silent meditation retreats, and those do wonders for my understanding of self and anxiety. And it was nice to see lots of other people in health sciences at my last one. You might want to consider doing one, especially if you now have plenty of time on your hands."
StudentNurse,37o5u5,monstertrucktoadette,2,Fri May 29 15:20:57 2015 UTC,"The whole feeling anxious that a patient could get sicker or die because of you is something I experience nearly every day. Except I'm not a student, I'm an RN that only started 6 months ago and it's terrifying. Even worse is that they are 100% my responsibility. However, I'm in a new grad residency and every. Single. Person. Says the same thing! We have meetings and discuss how we feel and that anxiety is 100% there in every new nurse. The best I can give you is that it eventually goes away. It hasn't yet for me but studies show it takes 12-18 months of working full time for a new nurse to feel confident in themselves. I hope your anxiety gets better and that you are able to return to do what you think is your calling because there are some wonderful days in nursing."
StudentNurse,37o5u5,painverse,2,Fri May 29 18:18:51 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry this has happened to you.   I would recommend that you get a professional to work with you, possibly through cognitive behavioral therapy and get this under control.

It's three days, geared to teaching you exactly how to think/what to be looking at for the NCLEX, and is a pretty good review so far.  Other than that, remember they don't expect you to know everything, but you should know the broad strokes of every subject, and as long as you know the why behind things (like why ANP releases in the heart, etc.), then you can help figure things out  One thing for the NCLEX: Assume in every question that the patient either has or is in risk for having something terrible, from what I've heard, there's never a question where the patient is fine and you can just sit there.  NCLEX is all about making sure you wont kill anyone, and wont sit there and watch them die, so do what you can to show them you wont."

I did the HURST review and thought it was a great way to simplify all the content we learned and go back to the basics. I really appreciated the content refresher and to simplify my thinking.   I also have the Saunders book and all the questions attached and have been doing those everyday. I think practice, practice, and more practice. You made it through nursing school and the knowledge is in there, you just have to pull it out!   Good luck."
StudentNurse,37jwfz,tjh28,1 point,Thu May 28 15:49:16 2015 UTC,"First of all - what have you done up to this point to prepare?   It's normal to feel nervous and stressed because all new grads have to take this exam - so everyone talks about it, and everyone has different experiences with it. And it's big money to raise hype and get students in a craze about it. The higher your stress level, the more resources you'll buy, and if you're super stressed, you might even fail - meaning you'll have to spend the money to re-take it.    But rather than freaking out and stressing over it - just get yourself prepared. It's just a test. And here's some good news, the national pass rate for this year is 85.27% for 1st time takers.   I personally believe Hurst (online version, as opposed to classroom) is the best resource.  A lot of people debate between choosing Hurst or Kaplan - Hurst teaches ""need to know content"" - it's condensed because you do not need to re-learn everything you learned in nursing school.  It's unnecessary. Kaplan teaches test taking strategy.   The reason why content is better than strategy is because if you know your content, and you know it well - you do not need a strategy to answer questions. You will understand the material well enough than to sit there and go through the Kaplan ""decision tree.""  I also highly recommend Saunders 6th Ed, and Lippincott Alternate Test Items as supplements to Hurst.   NCLEX is not a test of trickery.  It is a test for new nurses. You need to know how to prioritize, common diseases, treatments, interventions, labs, how to delegate to ancillary staff, your medical terminology, and your skills..  You need to do something every day to study.  You should be setting aside the majority of your day for nclex prep.  Whether it's to do nclex qs, to read, to watch videos, to write notes, whatever.    Take breaks when you need to. Eat/drink when you need to. And sleep when you need to. Don't drink alcohol. Don't go party. If you want to pass, you have to be selfish and tell your friends, your bf/gf you'll get back to them in a month. If you want to pass, you must be selfish, you must stay focused, be self-motivated and self-determined.

I also have a Kaplan strategy book, good for higher level questions and strategy if you do not want to buy the whole course. I took it a few months ago and failed. But it was because I was not properly prepared. It is manageable if you know your core content and know how to prioritize and keep your patient safe.

StudentNurse,37fvkg,R3nn,5,Wed May 27 09:36:47 2015 UTC,"I live in the U.S., but my friend is a nurse at an SNF where I have also worked as a CNA. She is the nurse for approximately 23-30 patients each day. Some of the patients are long term, some are hospice, and others are short term and are there for physical therapy and rehabilitation until they move to an assisted living facility or are able to go home. As far as pros go-- you gain lots of experience as a new nurse (i.e. wound cares, catheters, IV's, PEG tubes, time management, working with physicians, etc.), there is TONS of variety, and you have a chance to sometimes get to know your patients pretty well. Cons to this would be that nursing homes are notoriously understaffed-- my friend typically passes all medications for all her patients, does all their wound cares, diabetic cares, does paperwork, works with the physicians and lab techs, and tries to help the nursing aides when she can because they are short staffed too. She typically stays at least an hour and a half past her shift each day and is running pretty much constantly.   This can be a very good route for new nurses, especially for those who are interested in Geriatrics. I wouldn't say NO to a job as a nurse in a nursing home once I graduate, but I would personally prefer to work in a hospital. I think it all really comes down to preference and job availability."
StudentNurse,37fvkg,emilyyem,2,Wed May 27 16:11:19 2015 UTC,"Fellow student nurse here.  I did a 15 week clinical rotation at a long term care here in the U.S.  It was supposed to be a nice place...but it was such a sad experience.  I felt like no matter how much we did for the patients we were simply fighting the tide.  I sincerely hope there are better facilities, but I would be foolish to think that they are accessible to the general population (money).    You might have a better response if you head over to /r/nursing.  Do a search first, they don't like it when you post questions that have been asked multiple times before.  I hope Australia has better ratios than they require over in the U.S.  I can tell you that after that clinical rotation I decided I would never put my family/loved ones in a facility other than for hospice.  The ratios here set the staff up for failure.  There simply isn't a way to provide 100% care to every patient without the cooperation of every single staff member.  Even the best facility has a handful of staff that doesn't pull their weight.  With the ratios stacked against providing quality patient care, it only takes a few bad apples to cause harm to the patients."
StudentNurse,37fvkg,rayleighscattered,2,Wed May 27 18:26:18 2015 UTC,"I worked as a health care aide in a long term care facility in Canada, I also did a rotation in my first year of school there. The RN role was largely administrative - mainly charting, paperwork, care plans. They spoke to families a bit, but that mainly fell on the care manager while they were in. LPNs did most ""nursing tasks"" like med admin, tube feeds, etc. RNs would do this a bit more on evenings/nights. On nights, RNs would oversee 60+ patients on an entire floor. There weren't any IV meds or really complex patients at my facility and our nurses lost skills to the point that we would be transferring patients to the ER for a catheter placement if they had BPH (ER staff do not like this, I think for pretty good reason).   From my perspective, this particular facility was where RN skills go to die. The nurses were mostly old, grumpy, and lacking in basic nursing knowledge. I truly hope they are the exception but I know that in my city at least, it isn't the case."
StudentNurse,37fvkg,ohthatpeacock,1 point,Wed May 27 23:58:40 2015 UTC,"The role is to do what you're told (too much) and keep your mouth shut about the shitty conditions (too hard).   Your real role as a self respecting person is to find a reasonable job and send a clear message that you won't work in a shithole.    I've never been to a LTC or even SNF that I would put a dog in, never mind a vulnerable human being. USA here, don't know if shit's that fucked in Aus,  but if those ratios are any indication, I would run far and fast.  The ratios you and we have = neglect. Plain and simple truth."
StudentNurse,37ee4r,brutz616,2,Wed May 27 00:43:29 2015 UTC,"Don't get behind with the work. It'll bite you in the butt.   Study. Study. Study.   Befriend your teachers and go to study sessions if they are offered. It seriously makes the difference if you take the time out to show the teacher that you want to learn and that you are trying. In the end, that can influence a grade if you are borderline.   Don't be afraid to get a job as a nursing assistant if you haven't yet. I finally took the plunge last year to become a nursing assistant at a rather large hospital in my city and I have learned a ton. They actually hire nursing students so that they can basically 'train' us to help the transition of being a new nurse, as they'll hire us immediately when we graduate. I can't tell you how reassuring it is to know I've already got my job two years before I even graduate (1 know, but it was nice then as much as it is now!)."
StudentNurse,37ee4r,miloblue12,1 point,Wed May 27 08:57:21 2015 UTC,I am currently a medical assistant and i was planning on looking for jobs next summer for work. Do you think I should look for nursing assistant instead?
StudentNurse,37ee4r,miloblue12,1 point,Wed May 27 15:30:35 2015 UTC,"I'm more partial to nursing assistant because that puts you right there with the nurses and seeing exactly what they are doing and experiencing. It goes a long way because you interact with patients, different staff and get down and do the dirty stuff early.  It's completely up to you and where you want to end up (hospital, doctors office, etc)"

StudentNurse,37ee4r,hegist,1 point,Thu May 28 02:33:39 2015 UTC,"Congrats!! I just finished my 1st semester at UMSON. I did not work during the semester although I already had my CNA. I do have two interviews this week at UofM Medical Center. I suggest not working at first and get a feel for nursing school. Things are very different than they are for regular college. Take advantage of the GSS's. These are guided study sessions you can attend in addition to your classes. They are very helpful and are run by other students. Get involved on campus. I will be your NSGA Treasurer this fall!! You will be taking an AWFUL AWFUL class called Physiopharm your 1st semester. I don't know if you are aware but 2 semesters ago they changed around the BSN curriculum.  Physiopharm is a new class and it is structured awfully. There is no flow to the class and you will be learning various topics by about 8-10 different lecturers. Janet Wulf is supposed to teach it. She will be your ""teacher"". For Fundies, Dr. Lerner will be your prof. She is a hoot. She tests right from her PP's and lectured. I never opened up a book besides for lab. Health Assessment is taught by 2 different professors and is taught DIRECTLY from the book. I stopped going to that class and read the book.     Professional Role class will be taught mainly by Jennifer. She is awesome. Don't get too cocky going into the miderm with an A. The midterm and final both were a BITCH. I saw many people go into the midterm with an A and come out with a C or D. Research has many different professors so I can't say who you would have. They make that class so difficult. The exams are brutal. Let me know if you have anymore questions!  Don't get behind!!! You will play catch up all semester long. Make a master schedule of when things are due."
StudentNurse,37ee4r,Zebrasiscoolio,1 point,Thu May 28 03:57:14 2015 UTC,"Wow thank you so much for this. How do they make a research class difficult? I would have thought it would be writing papers.

StudentNurse,37bzg5,candies_sweets_sugar,6,Tue May 26 14:41:24 2015 UTC,"I would first look into your state's nursing programs.  I live in California and most of the CSUs here had similar prereqs and you need to find out what classes to take.  They're generally biology, chemistry, anatomy, physiology, microbiology, statistics, and etc..  Then I'd look into community colleges and enroll in those classes and do well in them.  You said you might not get financial aid help and community college classes are way cheaper than 4 year college classes.  Hope this helps!!"
StudentNurse,37bzg5,mothxr,2,Tue May 26 15:29:58 2015 UTC,Thank you that does help! :) And community college is all we have here in this small town anyway :P
StudentNurse,37bzg5,mothxr,2,Tue May 26 16:06:43 2015 UTC,"Also, so that would be a year or two of those classes + the four years of nursing?   Its just that since I graduated a few years ago I feel as if Im starting off a bit late now (will be 21 in a month)."
StudentNurse,37bzg5,destroyingtocreate,1 point,Tue May 26 16:10:25 2015 UTC,"No it would most likely be one to two years of prerequisite classes, and once you get into the program, it would be another two/two and a half years.  Total should be around 4-4.5 years.  However, some schools offer an accelerated program and it usually only takes 1-1.5 years of schooling after prerequisite classes! EDIT: misspelled years."
StudentNurse,37bzg5,destroyingtocreate,1 point,Tue May 26 16:44:54 2015 UTC,Wth!!! Thats even better! Lol youve been so much help :3
StudentNurse,37bzg5,destroyingtocreate,2,Tue May 26 16:58:33 2015 UTC,"The classes required to ENROLL into my California Community College were: Anatomy, Physiology (And anatomy was a pre-reque for physiology), Microbiology, English, Math, and Chem (although potentially your high school chemistry could count), General Psychology, Life-Span Psych.  To GRADUATE - (meaning, just because you've taken the aforementioned classes, plus the nursing courses, does not make you eligible to graduate - until you have taken the following, and it is strongly recommended by the nursing dept. to complete all of these before doing nursing courses) :: Speech 101, Sociology or Anthropology, Humanities Elective, Social & Behavioral Science Requirement, and Physical Education Course.   It varies upon your lifestyle as to how quickly you will be able to complete these courses. (I.E. Sometimes the courses fill up with people who hold seniority, or you simply just can't take on a ""full-time"" course load for whatever reason).   That being said - regardless of however long it takes you to complete the prerequisite courses, an associate nursing program (meaning the nursing courses alone) will take 4 semesters (2 years) to complete (assuming there are no setbacks).   I think an associate route is a good choice in that you can graduate with your RN (you take the exact same state boards as a bachelors degree nurse), and you can be making RN wages while doing either an online or in-class RN to BSN program, which is usually an additional 1 or 1.5 years. There is also a ""bridge to masters"" program that is available for RNs. Some hospitals will reimburse you for your continued education. So that's also a plus.  As far as ""specializing"" - you can potentially get a job immediately as an OB RN, however, if you go and search for OB/GYNE nursing jobs in your area and look at the ""requirements"" it will probably say something like X amount of years experience.  And therefore, you will probably have to start out in some other acute care unit, such as medical surgical. You could also do continued education and go on to to do midwifery if that is something you are interested in.   Edit: clarity"
StudentNurse,37bzg5,destroyingtocreate,2,Tue May 26 19:49:44 2015 UTC,Oh...wow. That's quite alot lol didnt realize what I was getting myself into. And you dont mean Physical Education Course as in...P.E do you?? D:  Edit: a word.
StudentNurse,37bzg5,mothxr,2,Tue May 26 20:05:25 2015 UTC,"Once you're in nursing - It's best to be finished with all the other courses so you can focus solely on the nursing courses, cause it's not a piece of cake! It takes up quite a bit (or all) of your time!   Generally, in an associate program the break down is like this:  1st sem: Fundamentals and Intro Med/Surg  2nd sem: Pediatrics and OB/GYNE  3rd sem: Med/Surg and Psych  4th sem: Critical Care Med/Surg and Management/Leadership  All 4 semesters you will be in the hospital doing clinical rotations, providing direct patient care."
StudentNurse,37bzg5,doctor_hooha,2,Tue May 26 20:37:54 2015 UTC,"I have always know one would need to do hands on work at an actual hospital, but seeing it broken down like that makes it both exciting and terrifying."
StudentNurse,37bzg5,doctor_hooha,2,Tue May 26 20:41:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think that's the general reaction most students have - excited and terrified. :) But it's definitely awesome and if you have the passion, it will all be worth it!   Rather than talking to a general counselor in your school's admission office, try reaching out specifically to your school (or ideal school's) nursing department's nursing counselor - generally there should be one in the department that will be better equipped to help you get started on your nursing school goals.   Also try to friend people who are already in the program at your school or surrounding schools if you can. They will be able to give you some advice also."
StudentNurse,37bzg5,penislover4ever,1 point,Tue May 26 21:03:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. lol. There are a lot of things to choose from usually.

My PE classes were usually only 1x/week."
StudentNurse,37av2c,womanwithoutborders,3,Tue May 26 07:06:26 2015 UTC,"I work in an ED. All of our scribes are pre med - although I don't see why a nursing student wouldn't be good for this position as well.   Anyways I think it's doable to do 20 hours a week. It really depends on your program and where you're at in life. I worked 24 hours a week and cut down because I have a husband/small child and they never saw me so it took a toll on our lives. If you're a single student or even one without too much responsibility (mortgage payment, car payment, etc) you should be fine. It'll give you good exposure plus a job when you graduate. The ED is a great place. I love that it's 24/7 so you can always get your hours in, no day is exactly the same, you never know what's walking through those doors, etc."

StudentNurse,37av2c,Fozee,2,Tue May 26 07:45:06 2015 UTC,"Your school will advise you of the same thing, really. Most nursing students work while they're in school, but for obvious reasons it's recommended to be unemployed if financially possible. It all comes down to how you are with time and stress management."
StudentNurse,37av2c,TorchIt,2,Tue May 26 10:56:24 2015 UTC,Getting into a healthcare setting will serve you well after you graduate. It'll be harder to get a job if you haven't made any contacts.  Go for it.
StudentNurse,37av2c,Ashrik,3,Tue May 26 20:55:08 2015 UTC,"I am a medical scribe, and have just graduated a 2 year nursing school for my RN. I started both within a month of each other. I essentially came in to work the midnight overnight shift, 7 PM to 7 AM, Fri/Sat/Sun or Sat/Sun/Mon, depending on which days I had class/clinicals. So, 36 hours a week.  For school, I was an evening student with classes 4 days a week, Mon-Thurs or Tues-Fri depending on the semester.  It helped tremendously, yes. I was more familiar with anatomy, pathophysiology, courses of treatment, and commonly used drugs than most of classmates, save those who were the most excellent students or studied exponentially more than I ever did.  It was also tremendously difficult while doable. I was ""on"" 7 days a week, and our exams would occasionally be on the Monday or Tuesday, 2 hours after my shift ended.  But it let me survive. It let me pay my rent and bills. I still have to take out loans, but that's okay since it's an investment.  It was worth it for me, definitely. I just graduated cum laude and I'm already enrolled in the 4 year program where I live. I'll probably be taking the NCLEX next month.  But I couldn't in good faith recommend this for everyone. It was tough, but I operate well with incomplete sleep and I typically have an easier time recalling information on exams than most. If it wasn't for these sort of natural traits, it could have gone terribly poorly for me. I'm single and have no children.  Many of the scribes or CIM's who worked with me were considering or attending medical school or PA school. As a nursing student, I'm sort of rare in this company that staffs the physicians/NP's/PA's/scribes of many ER's in hospitals in NJ and the surrounding states.  e: In terms of school load, my school has a single nursing class each semester (Nursing 110, 120, 210, 220) that is between 7-9 credits. 2 days reserved for theory and 2 for clinical. So I was a part time student with that for the first 3 semesters, and a full time student with 2 extra online classes (15 credits total) this last semester in order to graduate on time."
StudentNurse,37av2c,happyalex,2,Tue May 26 21:27:47 2015 UTC,"I wish I had seen this when you first posted it!  I'm currently in a BSN program (started last fall) and I've been an ED scribe for 2+ years, and I started rounding with a hospitalist on the floors 1 year ago.  It's totally doable, and it gets you used to working those 12(sometimes +) hour shifts, the lingo, the medications, procedures, etc. I'm going to go further though and go to NP school so this will also help there.  I usually work twice a week, sometimes 3x a week. It's hard sometimes, but sometimes I get to do school work or study while on the clock and that's definitely nice.  There's also a /r/medicalscribe but it's not really active"

Is there any way your school could record lectures, and you could watch them/take exams from abroad? That's how I took all of my classes while I was abroad.   Otherwise, could you take the course during a break at another school (either in the US or Australia)? You could probably find an online version of the course at an American school somewhere.   Where in the US will you be?"

StudentNurse,376f0y,thankyawww,1 point,Mon May 25 13:24:01 2015 UTC,"Surgery went alright on 26 May. Unfortunately due to the excessive rain that day, there was quite a bit of flooding and the doctors were a bit late getting into the hospital.  Pre-Op, I was potentially looking at having a central line inserted, but the surgeon said I wouldn't need it and had two large bore IVs and an arterial line put in instead.   My surgery was estimated at being 4-6 hours, ended up being 11 due to complications at getting to the aneurysm itself. The day after surgery apparently I had a pretty substantial seizure that potentially almost killed me. Post-operative picture  Spent about 6 days in the hospital before being discharged. Funny thing is the majority of the pain is not in my head, it's in my hips from how they had me strapped down to the OR room table, but that's slowly but surely getting better. Biggest obstacle is feeling fatigued most of the day and having minor memory gaps, but nothing too major.   So, 2 weeks later and things are doing pretty well and as the days go by, they continue to get better. Thanks for asking!"

StudentNurse,376f0y,abandabee1,11,Mon May 25 13:33:15 2015 UTC,"I was medically retired from the U.S. Marine Corps in 2010. Part of that retirement was for chronic migraines. During my MedSurg I clinical rotation last summer, my migraines increased in frequency and intensity, to include several bouts with cluster headaches that would wake me from a dead sleep at 2 AM.  Since the Imitrex was not longer cutting it and I was self-medicating with a cocktail of Seroquel and Percocet, I finally got into the doctors to get re-evaluated by neurology. Since I had not been seen at the VA Hospital here since moving and starting nursing school, they wanted to run a baseline MRI which followed up with a CT w/contrast.  TL;DR - Incidental finding"

StudentNurse,376f0y,seizuresrock,6,Mon May 25 17:30:04 2015 UTC,"No injuries that come to mind aside from a mild concussion or two along the way.  I was in-patient for about 30 days at the Navy Hospital in San Diego that lead to a medical review board determining I was going to be retired from the Marines. Details of hospitalization = HIPAA.   During my stay in the hospital I had this one crotchety old nurse who if you cut her she'd bleed dust, she helped kick my butt into gear and on the road to recovery back in 2009; that was a major factor in becoming a nurse, my mom is also a nurse so there's that as well.

StudentNurse,372al5,Kitschead,9,Sun May 24 04:58:07 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! You will remember these experiences for the rest of your career. I'm excited for you!  In my rotations, we were expected to give morning care before we had been signed off to give meds. This is mouth care and bed baths or assisting the client with bathing. For your patient mix they will likely have a) difficulty laying flat due to worsening dyspnea, and b) a LOT of mucous that built up during the night. So, provide the most therapeutic interventions you can as far as hygiene is concerned but try to keep the head of the bed elevated while you do so. Also, encourage coughing and deep breathing. If anyone is coughing up colored sputum, as the primary nurse or your instructor if you should collect a sample. Trach care will be needed (remember your sterile technique!) and you may even be able to suction some people.   Your #1 priority is to learn. ASSESSMENTS, ASSESSMENTS, ASSESSMENTS! Get used to really seeing your patient and hearing their story. Put their history together with a thorough and thoughtful head-to-toe assessment and consider how it all will affect their recovery. Keep your nursing diagnosis in mind when caring for your clients to remind you to focus on what the patient needs most.   The point of your presence is for you to learn and observe so while you will be a ball of nerves, remember that you are only the student for now - focus on learning. not on beating yourself up over what you don't remember to do. With that being said, don't forget that for the rest of your career you will be the one link between the patient and every other service they receive in the hospital. As I was taught and will never forget, ""you are your patients' last hope."" Be an advocate for safe care and do what you can to provide your patients with comfort and education about their condition to prepare them well for their discharge. Most of all, have fun!"

I was on a respiratory floor last semester and my instructor joked that I was the head of code brown team because I helped so many people clean up patients and change beds (all I knew how to do at first). After a few weeks other nurses were pulling me into rooms to pull central lines, do dressing changes, help with marrow biopsies,  stuff I never would have seen if I was in the break room with my classmates."

StudentNurse,37324o,dharmabumzzz,3,Sun May 24 12:11:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know what your gpa is like or any of your other nursing school requirements, just throwing in my two cents that California is really hard to get into. I was in Southern California so maybe that was part of the problem, but even the accelerated were hard to get into. I was always advised against Entry MSN programs because you lose the experience you gain from working with your BSN, that's something that would vary from person to person though also. Because the advise is also always to go back later for your MSN after working for a bit. The pro of that is sometimes you're working for a hospital who will actually pay for you to go back to get your MSN and continue your education.   You can definitely apply for programs that aren't accelerated. I have my bachelors in something else and I looked into it, but ultimately decided to go through an accelerated program. I didn't want to spend another two years in school.   I want to say I looked into Samuel Merrit as a last ditch effort in California and something wasn't good about it. I really can't remember what. The 75k might have been it haha. I'd recommend typing them into google as well as allnurses and that's a forum where people go more in depth with their experiences with schools. You might be able to read some reviews on the school."

One of the reasons I chose missouri was because I have family I could move in with and because it was 30k. There's private schools in California that pretty much anyone can get into, but they don't have good ratings and they cost like 100k haha. When I looked into schools there, I compiled a list of schools that I met the requirements for and went from there. I just went to the California Nursing Board website. They have all the accredited schools and NCLEX pass ratings which are like probably in the top of important things."
StudentNurse,37324o,thefeeding,2,Sun May 24 16:52:25 2015 UTC,"Yes Yes Yes and no- if it isn't regionally accredited, transcripts may become an issue if you plan to further your education. If not accredited by ACEN or CCNE, some places like the VA won't hire you. But almost everywhere else will.    A side note, MSN is not a bad way to go, especially if you are considering paying 60-75k tuition. With an advanced degree, you have the opportunity to make more money, thus lightening the burden of higher student loans."
StudentNurse,37324o,thefeeding,1 point,Sun May 24 13:17:02 2015 UTC,"If I'm going to be paying 60-75k, I might as well get a MSN but otherwise I really can't see how it's worth it.  UPenn, ranked #1, has an accelerated BSN and that costs only 25k"

StudentNurse,37324o,doctor_hooha,1 point,Mon May 25 01:41:12 2015 UTC,"A direct-entry MSN with no other nursing experience?  None really.  MSNs with experience as a nurse first, plenty.  Areas like education and unit management immediately come to mind, plus practitioners have at least their MSN."

StudentNurse,37324o,arrow452,1 point,Sun May 24 16:16:36 2015 UTC,I think Cal State East Bay has one which is close to the other one you're looking at and much cheaper.  I think any schools in that area are going to be impacted for that degree and you may be put on a waitlist.  Which isn't so bad because by the time you get in you'll qualify as a California resident and be able to pay in state tuition.    Are you set on moving to the bay for school or would you consider some other places?
StudentNurse,37324o,Llamapants,1 point,Sun May 24 16:33:52 2015 UTC,"Most the California schools don't have waitlist. You have to reapply each year. I don't know about Cal State East Bay, but that's how it is for Cal State Channel Islands/Fullerton/Long Beach/San Marcos, so I think it's probably a Cal State thing."

Imagine all the various and sundry things affected by that amount of blood.  Imagine in your head some fluid in a tube.  In your imagination, change the amount of fluid.  What are the effects on the tube?  On the speed of the fluid?  What sorts of effects can you imagine that having on the body?    If your imagination isn't so good, try kitchen experiments or drawing pictures.  Whatever the associated physiology, do whatever stuff you need to do to wrap your head around it.

StudentNurse,3716oz,InimitableMe,1 point,Sun May 24 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"Every student learns things in a way that is unique to them.   I will say for me, something that helped was that whenever I heard someone in my study group ask a question about a topic, I tried to teach the topic to them by drawing out whatever we were talking.  I figured that if I could come up with a semi-coherent way of teaching someone else, then that would mean that I truly knew the area we were working on.  And if in the middle of my rambling lecture I realized I was talking out of my ass, then me and my friend could work together to discover the answers."
StudentNurse,3716oz,CalvinsStuffedTiger,1 point,Mon May 25 06:15:54 2015 UTC,"Application.   For example - Aldosterone and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). First what is aldosterone? It's a hormone, and our body either secretes more or less to keep us in a state of homeostasis. When we have too much salt and water (or fluid), aldosterone increases so that we can secret this excess volume. When we are are lacking enough fluid volume, we secrete less so that we can hold on to what volume we have.   So, consider the following with the above in mind: heart failure (which causes edema, either systemically or pulmonary) ..  hypovolemic shock ..  increased blood pressure .. and medications to treat these conditions and how each of these things mentioned may affect aldosterone, and the compensatory mechanism of the body.    When doing nclex questions - really review the rationale, and make sure you understand exactly what the information is saying."

Is it going to be IV as well? I'd just memorize the BSA formulas (and all you need to remember is square root of h*w divided by 3600 for metric or 3131 for household). And conversions from mL to household (easy = 5, 15, 30 ... tsp, tbl, oz.)  I usually don't memorize anything. These tests tend to be a breeze (at least they are at my school).

That looks more like our course final for clinical calculations than a regular dosage exam. Have you taken a clinical calc class before?  That test is probably more like the test our school has to opt out of the class. It's mainly aimed at people who have been readmitted and already took dosage calc so they don't have to take it again.  Honestly, I'd prob just take the class. It's not impossible to learn everything in a few weeks, but eh, it's a little crazy. Totally up to you. I can see the merit of skipping the class. Get the textbook and do all the practice questions. :)"

We needed to take a course a a get 100% to move on in our nursing program. And every semester we were given a med test at the first clinical day and we also needed 100% to stay in the program. Lost quite a few people for failing the med tests.
StudentNurse,36zn3d,justlikethemoon,3,Sat May 23 15:04:21 2015 UTC,"We have med math tests at the beginning of each class.  We need to get 100% or fail the entire class.  Luckily we get two tries, if you fail the first time, you remediate and get to take the test again.  The best advice I can give is to practice, practice, practice.  I know it is a little short on time, but if you can get a hold of ""Curren's Math for Meds,"" it would help a lot.  It's not a cheap book considering it is just a workbook, but it is one of the best I've used."

StudentNurse,3709ej,starstuff89,1 point,Sat May 23 22:02:39 2015 UTC,"I always felt more awkward pretending to do an assessment on a dummy than doing a real one.  Working  in the lab sucks.  I've been told from countless nurses ""well in the real world....(we do this, or we don't do this)"" or ""in an ideal world, this is what you should do, but that will probably never happen.""  My point is, don't get discouraged, just do your best, learn as much as you can, and get through it.   Once you're in an actual setting and have some guidance,  things start to click and fall into place.  In the meantime, learn as much as you can to prepare you for when you enter ""the real world"".  Also, if you havent already, get a job in healthcare....any job you can find that will work with your school schedule, etc.  IMO if you have zero experience in Healthcare when you graduate, it takes much much longer for anything to 'click'.  You are behind the learning curve and the rest of the staff has less patience and willingness to help you."

It felt so fake, I could not talk to the dummy like a person and ""pretend.""  Practice on your friends, your roommates, your SO. Sign up to help at flu shot clinics or BP screenings. Practice makes perfect!  Tips for catheter practice. Go buy oranges. Peel the oranges, and pull out the white stuff from the middle - ta-da! You now have a fairly life-like urethra. I've heard hot dogs, if you poke a hole in the middle with a straw, also work.   IVs are HARD. I have a friend whose dad works in EMS. He brought us a few IV kits, so we practiced on each other a few times."
StudentNurse,3709ej,gringas4lyfe,1 point,Tue May 26 18:55:14 2015 UTC,"It's been said a few times already but I have to stress this, take every opportunity to practice your skills.

StudentNurse,36ubwd,-nurse-,2,Fri May 22 04:37:39 2015 UTC,"How to function on four hours of sleep or less.   On a serious note,  if you are an introvert like me I would read How to win friends and influence people,  you are going to have to lean on your friends in school, and they are essential in helping you get through it.    You can do it alone but it will be much more difficult.   Also,  if you have a job already I would work crazy over time and save up some money,  the less you have to worry about money,  the more you can spend your time studying.   Don't worry,  you will make plenty of it when  you graduate."
StudentNurse,36ubwd,CalvinsStuffedTiger,2,Fri May 22 05:43:33 2015 UTC,"I would avoid doing too much prep. Nursing schools usually have a schedule and a timeline of what they want you to know and when. Learning advanced stuff often means you miss the basics or skip the process.  The suggestions to read how to win friends and influence people is a great l.  Medical terminology is another great reference.  It depends, if you are like me and memorization is difficult for you then anatomy, microbiology, pharmacology, and medical terminology could all be prepped by memorizing terminology.  I worked on these on my down time since memorization is so difficult for me, mostly just by making flash cards.  If you can get a job as a nurse assistant or secretary this is great prep as it will introduce you to the setting, start your working relationship with coworkers and patients, as well as get you familiar with terminology.  Joining the ANA (or if you already know your specialty then join their group) can give you monthly magazines and journals to be hip to how nurses think and current topics.  From my experience I found these things to be true and hopefully they will be of help (although not exactly what you asked, I know):  -Nursing school doesn't make you into a nurse. It gives you a degree to show you have the basics to begin to learn how to be a nurse.  -There are more things to know about medicine than any one person can. Be humble, be able to admit you don't know, and use every person as a teammate and a resource. Humility is a great way to show you are open to learning.  -As a clinical coach (I train ICU / critical care nurses) I am terrified of new nurses who don't ask questions.  If any nurse treats you like crap for asking a question then they aren't doing their job.  It is in most nurses contract / job description to train new nurses."
