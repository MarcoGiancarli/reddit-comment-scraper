Iodine deficiency is a potentially serious health concern that can lead to significant developmental, physiological, and anatomical problems. In many regions, particularly inland areas of developed nations, the primary source of iodine is iodized table salt.

He's right, how can we be sure George Miller didn't have his hands tied and wasn't forced to cowtow to the SJWlluminati? I mean, there's no evidence suggesting this wasn't the case, after all... Even if there was, it would probably just be more propaganda planted by feminists to make us think he was supportive of feminism! Those SJWs are clever!"

SRSFunny,361ofu,EldritchBug,18,Fri May 15 10:22:56 2015 UTC,I love how this was voted into the ground at r/funny. I guess feminists are the ones that can't take a joke.

SRSFunny,35iu4w,O_Kav,12,Sun May 10 23:35:42 2015 UTC,"Anarcho-Capitalism just thinks that the economy should be based on voluntary transactions!  Employers are permitted to rape their employees (if you don't like it, find another job!) but employees are not permitted to join unions as unions oppress the employers.  Also, did you know that needing to eat and having a roof over your head is voluntary?  If someone trespasses on your private property it is grounds for summary execution, but we can trust the holders of vast amounts of capital to have the power of life and death over things on their property because if they do bad things, in 1000 years of boycotts they might lose part of their money.  Anarcho-Capitalism - because too many people would hate it if it were called Neofeudalism."
SRSFunny,35iu4w,Scrappythewonderdrak,8,Mon May 11 06:22:21 2015 UTC,Why did the anarcho-capitalist fail their thermodynamics exam?  Because they thought that the only state function was protecting private property.
