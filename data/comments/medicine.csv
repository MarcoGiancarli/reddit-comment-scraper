The reason may be more asylum seekers and more that live hidden.  Ihsan stopped talking in February, says his mother.  He was not looking at the TV, did absolutely nothing, and eventually he stopped also to eat.  Previously Ihsan school. He was playing with friends, and was the 8-year-old any time. Now he lies still and silent with closed eyes, day and night. He does not respond to touch, and the food and drink he gets through a tube into the stomach.  The number of children who are diagnosed with exhaustion syndrome has increased. Many of them receive care through Sachsska Children's Hospital in Stockholm, where Mikael Billing manage asylum psychiatric unit on child and youth psychiatric BUP.  In the last three years we have seen an increase, and in 2014 it was even a few more children than before who became ill. Then it was even more children 2004/2005 who became ill, so at first they had a decrease, and then it has now risen again.  There is no nationwide statistics on the number of children with apathy syndrome, but Sachs had last year, 21 newly diagnosed patients, compared to 12-15 years before. Figures from the Swedish Migration Board also suggests an increase in children with apathy syndrome in recent years.  Mikael Billing think it might be because there are more asylum seekers to Sweden now and that more live in hiding.  We are in contact with more hidden families. The children may have experienced severe trauma and live in an imperfect situation here for many years, and then there is a risk that they develop apathy syndrome, says Mikael Billing.  Although police figures suggest more hidden. The number of wanted persons to be expelled from Sweden have increased significantly in the last five years.  Probably it is very severe stress that makes kids get sick. Many have been turned down his application for asylum when they suffer, and the family are very worried to return to their home country.  Eight-year-old Ihsan and his mother comes from a country in Central Asia but are now living as undocumented in Sweden. GÃ¼ler has lost all hope for the future, and cries when she talks about their situation.  I want my son to be healthy, but doctors say the only way is that he gets security and a normal life again, she says.  After that echoes The reporter met her so now Migration Board decided to give her and her two children a residence permit.*"
