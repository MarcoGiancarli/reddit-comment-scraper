MadeMeSmile,3e339m,XYMan28,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:17:40 2015 UTC,Those clipped tails make me sad.
MadeMeSmile,3e339m,C3ntur,5,Tue Jul 21 17:08:49 2015 UTC,They are born that way.  The tails haven't been docked or cut.
MadeMeSmile,3e339m,fathomdepths,5,Tue Jul 21 17:30:21 2015 UTC,wow i didnt know that! nvm then. What kind of dog is this exactly?
MadeMeSmile,3e339m,C3ntur,3,Tue Jul 21 17:38:38 2015 UTC,Looks like an English Bulldog. Bred their tails back into stubs sadly. No cutting but still a long line of genetically enforced defects in the breed. Super nice dogs though.

MadeMeSmile,3dzqup,Warphim,3,Mon Jul 20 21:10:04 2015 UTC,This truly did make me smile. What a lovely gift to give these folks who have not much else to do during the day. And for them to get to hear the music that they grew up with. Fabulous!
MadeMeSmile,3dzqup,congalinechachacha,2,Mon Jul 20 23:24:25 2015 UTC,This is fantastic!
