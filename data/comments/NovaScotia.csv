Keep an eye out for if anyone buys them out, because they have a great location with a big ""chalet"", a bunch of cottages and a building you could have the reception in if it rains. I went rafting there last year when a wedding was happening and it looked awesome. I'm sure there are other cottage type places you could find. There's also Hatfield Farms, which might be close to what you're looking for."

Can't bring home brew though :(  Been to a wedding last year at Hatfield Farm, they served home brew, close to Halifax, on site accommodations as well. We didn't look into ourselves as we were looking for ocean view.  Also there is the barn out by exit 6 on the 103 where they have the Hubbards farmers market. I don't know anything about this venue for a wedding other than it exists, and looks nice when I've been there for Farmers markets. One thing I would mention is once you start to get into Lunenburg County accommodations become allot harder to find if your looking to sleep more than 50 people."

Yes - then you qualify for more grants than you know what to do with until the government changes and then you must close shop for some number of years mod 4[nerds will get it]. You will also qualify for tax breaks, tax rebates, low rent, and more promotions than you know what to do with. Have fun on the trade mission to some country with great prostitutes. No - then a politically connected firm will identify your success and set up shop across the street funded with more money than they know what to do with. You will also be ignored by the local press and any events that celebrate entrepreneurs. Have fun while they take all your staff at salaries you can't match on trade junkets to countries with great prostitutes.   One thing to be aware of is that if you answered yes you must hive off 1% of your grant money to give out as political donations. Plus you must hive off another 1% to give to select charity events run by the wives of the powerful and connected. Plus you must hire some children of those who helped you get the grants; just put them into the same accounting category you put the other potted plants. Also you must make sure that nearly 100% of your purchasing is done from other politically connected firms so as to make them less of the failures that they all are. This can be a real minefield if you rent from the developer who is on the outs as opposed to the developer who isn't.

NovaScotia,3d95ac,origombie,3,Tue Jul 14 13:54:05 2015 UTC,"I'd highly recommend Inverness/Mabou area, Ingonish (where Wreck Cove campground is) and Baddeck in Cape Breton.  Since you're into a windery, Glenville (next to Inverness) has North America's first Single Malt Whisky distillery, and Baddeck has the only organic beer brewery around here, they're both great places to stop.  This is Inverness Beach, it's 10+km long and the water will be 20C+, there is also a campground 200 feet from the water. Right next to it is Mabou with the Red Shoe Pub that is like this every night, it's a great way to experience our culture.  When you drive the Cabot Trail, you'll pass through Cheticamp which is up north and is a French-Acadian town, a lot of history there, fiddle music as well and a beautiful beach.  If you like hiking, Ingonish is probably your best bet since there are beaches lakes and waterfalls all around the town. I'd recomend hiking Mount Franey, this is the view.  If you find yourself up north near Dingwall/Aspy Bay/Cape North area, it has the prettiest beach in the world. That pointed mountain in the middle is called Wilkie Sugarloaf, I hiked it (about 50 min up and 25 min down if you're in reasonable shape), here's a picture I took from the top.  Another fun stop on the Cabot Trail is the Gaelic College, the only Gaelic School outside of the UK, of course if you go to Sydney the Fortress of Louisbourg is a great stop and has a lot of French history of Canada.....The best thing I can suggest for exploring Cape Breton is to meet with the locals, go to a pub with fiddle music, look for pamphlets and bulletin boards, every weekend you will find cultural events from breakfast to midnight."

It is on the water and next to a beautiful beach and is situated between the ferry and the town of Pictou. While in Pictou, you should check out the Waterfront, check out the Ship Hector replica and I suggest eating at the Salt Water Cafe. If you want to spend more time in Pictou County, there are 4 other towns that are less than 10 minutes away. New Glasgow and Stellarton are the biggest, followed by Westville and Trenton. There are some great places to eat in New Glasgow, like ""The Dock"" or ""Mamatsu"". There is a place along the river in Rotary Park where you can rent kayaks, canoes, bikes (including tandem bikes). About 15 minutes north of New Glasgow, following the coast is another beautiful beach (think California beautiful) called Melmerby Beach.  Outside of Pictou County: The cabot trail is a nice drive in Cape Breton, but it will take an entire day. If you like adventure, I recommend trying your hand at surfing at either Lawerencetown Beach or Martinique Beach which are not far from Dartmouth. Rentals are near both beaches.

NovaScotia,3d3x5v,Gummmmy,12,Mon Jul 13 12:31:22 2015 UTC,They can't switch providers. The network is the only one that exists in fact the government gave Eastlink millions to get this network up. Eastlink promised more then they could deliver and now it is the governments job to enforce the promises Eastlink made.

Other options are Xplore Net and Seaside. I believe both have data caps, and your speed (for Seaside) depends on how close you are from a tower. I don't know anyone that has experience with Xplore Net. Eastlink has no services in the area where I live."
NovaScotia,3d3x5v,temporaryunicorn,2,Mon Jul 13 21:52:22 2015 UTC,"Depends on your area. Xplorenet, Bell, and Seaside are unavailable here. Only Eastlink and dial up. Might as well go back to dial up soon."

So add $23 ($20 + HST) to that for the 15Gb overage cap ($76.99) - until some time in the fall, when they then plan on charging for every Gb we use.  To put this level of speed into context, you can't stream any kind of video (like people post/share on Fb) without constant buffering, and it sometimes takes about a minute (or more) to attach a 1Mb photo to an email.  Many news sites use auto-play video or rotating graphics, most people have security software that constantly checks certificates, programs on your computer auto update or talk with their parent company as you use them, etc. etc. etc. So you're using up your data even when you think you're not doing anything.  This isn't just about us rural folks crying we can't stream Netflix. It's a situation where a company is refusing to even do basic upgrades to their equipment to keep pace with technology.  Or in this case, to give us service that is about 5 years behind."

NovaScotia,3d3x5v,sonician,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:00:07 2015 UTC,Typically it is because in order for them to deploy the equipment and recoup the cost they have to charge more because there are much fewer people paying to use it.

Imagine a rural company that uses a cell phone and email to perform business duties. The owner of that company would not be able to use his internet connexion for anything but email if he wanted to make sure his costs stayed at a reasonable place.

The sites are well maintained, there's an outhouse, and lots of streams to filter water. Do not drink directly from streams, ever. See me last comment to another person to learn more about Cape Chignecto.  The Bay of Fundy is our natural wonder of the world, and the biggest must see in Nova Scotia. The national parks are nice enought, but the provincial parks are great too. Make reservations, or you won't be camping anywhere. If you are hiking, Kejimkujik is not a good destination.  There is a very, VERY nice (but short) hike in the Kejimkujik seaside adjunct, if you are in that part of the province. Go to Cape Split provincial park, and hike the Cape Split trail, visit the towns along the way. This is a 100% must do. Wolfville is beautiful. Taylor Head is a really nice spot too.   In Cape Breton, I recommend driving it counter clockwise. Stop in Arichat for the real rural beauty CB is famous for. See the Mira River for some nice driving or paddling. Sydney sucks Don't go there. Sorry Sydney.  The CB National Park is great, the one hike that everyone does is the Skyline Trail. It's pretty incredible. Be careful though, lots of moose.   If you like to hike, go to Pollett's Cove. It's just outside the park, and it's free! It's a better hike and camp site than anything in the park.  It's a magical destination, actually.   If you want a real tip? Stay here for one night - the Big Intervale Fishing Lodge. You don't have to like fishing to go here. This is yet another incredible tucked-away part of Nova Scotia, and a hidden gem. Have Herman the German make you a steak - best I've eaten anywhere. He's actually Austrian, but it's fun to call him Herman The German. I took my wife here on our honeymoon, and it will take your breath away.   Have fun!"
NovaScotia,3cpsef,kayriss,3,Thu Jul 9 22:16:48 2015 UTC,"In Cape Breton, I recommend driving it counter clockwise.   Seconded.  The reason for this is it puts you on the outside lane on the steep hills around Cape Smokey etc."

NovaScotia,3cpsef,ITdoug,5,Fri Jul 10 14:48:05 2015 UTC,"I'm from Cape Breton, the best beach is in Inverness. Water temp will be 20C when you get there, the campground is amazing but booked solid for most of the summer, call now if you want a cabin, they could be booked solid but if you don't mind tenting that will be easier to get. The beach is 10km long, you can walk it until your feet ache, and it's also full of sea glass.  It's also next to Mabou and Port Hood, this area is probably the best to experience Cape Breton culture, there will be events every night of the summer, the best way to experience our culture is to just meet the locals, go to a pub. The Red Shoe Pub in Mabou (15 min from that beach) is like this every night.  Secondly if you want to hike, your best bet would be to drive the Cabot Trail and go to Ingonish, or up north near Dingwall. Both are incredibly beautiful. Ingonish is inside the Highlands National Park and there are waterfalls, trails, beaches all over the place. There is a hiking trail called Mount Franey that's pretty moderate, about 2.5km to hike and this is the view: http://i.imgur.com/Pf7Sh8D.jpg  This is Ingonish Beach, it will be very crowded and also much colder since it's on the east side facing the open ocean, but still tolerable.  Another alternative to Ingonish is to go north to Dingwall, I went hiking a few weeks ago there and took this picture: https://farm1.staticflickr.com/479/18514201141_32431ecaa1_k.jpg it was around 3 hours total up and down. White Point is a great stop on the way, and in Dingwall is Cabot's Landing Provincial Park Beach (the pointy mountain you can see in both those pics is the one I climbed, it's Wilkie Sugarloaf Trail).  Between Inverness and either of those places, Baddeck is a must stop. There is an organic beer brewery there plus a lot of boat tours that sail around the Bras d'Or lakes.  I'd probably skip out on the Sydney area (where I live), there is a lot to do here like the Fortress of Louisbourg, but not really worth it unless you'd be there for at least 3 days.  Remember to meet the locals, Cape Breton has a thriving Celtic culture and some of the friendliest people on Earth, there are even Gaelic Speakers and a Gaelic College here. The best way to experience the island is on campgrounds and pubs with us!"

NovaScotia,3cpsef,Sockmonkee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:42:38 2015 UTC,"1) Hike Cape Split.  2) If you go to Cape Split you'll be in the valley so check out kentville/wolfville. If not definitely go to Halls harbour. Tiny little spot but if you've never seen the worlds largest tides (happens twice a day) it'll blow your mind especially at low tide.   Packed? Probably, they tend to get busier when the dollar is weaker. Just call them and ask. You'd prolly only be in or around a park if you go to Keji or the highlands.   There's TONS of beaches everywhere. It's surrounded by the ocean and the interior is nothing but lakes. Heck, if you stay in Halifax, Dartmouth is called the ""city of lakes"".   On the cabot Trail.There's a nice beach on the other side of Kelly's mountain if you drive counter clockwise.   Honestly except for the north side of the trail it can be not as scenic as you think. The best parts of the trail definitely make it the most beautiful and jaw dropping scenery in Canada. Google waterfalls along the cabot trail. THERE'S TONS OF THEM but you can't see any of them from the road itself. you have to hike into the woods a bit. Some of the better ones I've been to have natural ""waterfall slides""/swimming holes. There's a great one near ingonish."
NovaScotia,3cphe6,MarilyneC,5,Thu Jul 9 18:56:38 2015 UTC,"I've done Chignecto 9 times. Here's how to win at the greatest hike in Nova Scotia by far.    Do three nights, not two. It's so beautiful, take as much time as you can.  I recommend reserving a site in advance. Why? Because while the whole area is great, some of the sites are the best I've ever stayed in, while others are just so-so. Take my advice - go clockwise, starting at Red Rocks, stay night one in Refugee Cove, night two in Big Bald Rock, and night three in Seal Cove. The last day is the longest, but you'll have light bags and you'll just want out. You can also cheat and walk out via the Eatonville road, if you have sore knees or it's crappy out.  I've never rented a bunk, but I've heard that staying at Red Rocks is nice. Seriously though, camp every chance you get.  Chignecto is essentially one big loop, for most people there's no need to try any side hikes or trips, just getting through the 60k loop is challenge enough.  the beaches at the sites I mentioned are amazing, but usually about 5 minutes walk from the camp sites. My killer Chignecto tip - don't forget to bring a simple cotton shopping bag. This is so you can set up camp, then fill the bag with you stove, pots and pans, food, drink, seats, etc, and spend your evenings on the beach without hauling your whole backpack around.  there's lots of sources of water at each site, and along the way. With a good filter you'll never run out of water.  there is usually a small waterfall at big bald rock - perfect time for a shower (after a swim. Don't chicken out!) eat lunch at the actual cape chignecto point - it's really nice there. Don't mess around with the cliffs though, you'll die if you fall.  you need happy feet to do this hike. Bring lots of changes of quality socks, and only hike in boots you have broken in. I'm not kidding. I've seen experienced hikers do this hike in new boots, and they get hamburger feet.  Bugs are only really bad inland in my experience.  The hardest climbs are about 2/3 of the way to refugee, and then immediately coming out of refugee towards big bald rock.  I wear a brimmed hat and just put one foot in front of the other, resisting the temptation to look up. There's always more climbing. Oh, also - going down is harder on your body than going up. Go slowly downhill.  wake up early! Get the hiking over with and enjoy that beach time. It's a magical place!  Stop at Granny's near 5 Islands for clams and chips on the way home. It's about an hour's drive, but worth the wait.    Holy hell, I wrote you a book. Have fun!"

The only time that this issue gets noticed is when there are protests like this.  I believe the rates should be higher, they're ridiculously low, and the fact is, some people will never be off of assistance because of disability issues.  As a landlord, I've been approached by social assistance clients countless times for a place to live.  I creatively have to come up with reasons to decline them, since I'm not allowed to discriminate against them 'because' they're on social assistance.  It's not so much because they're on social assistance, it's because assistance doesn't provide enough money to pay market rate rents.  Which is why there's a growing number of underground rental units out there that don't meet building/fire code regulations."

Obviously the amount that DCS gives people is insufficient, but this person is certainly not making their situation any easier with 4 pets.

Instead they would rather spend money sending those who take a drug harming no one but themselves to jail, and then spending our tax dollars healing those who OD or take bad hits because kits like these aren't available.  Just like they think making Marijuana legal encourages it when Canada currently has more teen smokers than any other industrialized nation...and other countries that have taken on decriminalization or legalization and regulation have seen their usage decrease in the long term.

NovaScotia,3bx7vx,trydoingitbackwards,21,Thu Jul 2 22:11:21 2015 UTC,"The surrounding area is quite lovely, at least landscape wise. There are tons of great views within a 20 minute drive. For activities, there are a wide variety of salt/fresh water beaches that provide great fishing, swimming, surfing, and any other water sport you can think of in the summer. There are soccer, football, hockey and rugby clubs for ages 20 and up, as well as lots of great hiking and camping near by. Basically anything you can do outdoors. Don't expect any sort of night life though, there are a few sleazy bars and the odd pub/pool hall. Other than that you'll have to go to Halifax.  There are gyms in new minas and wolfville, all about 10 minutes drive from Kentville and easily accessible by public transportation.  The Annapolis valley is an unofficial retirement community, so you'll find a lot more old people than people in their 20's. 8 months of the year there are a few thousand students in wolfville though, which is close to kentville and improves the valleys old/not old ratio drastically. So as long as you're a decently social person you'll meet people no problem, especially if you're planning on joining clubs/teams. There are buses that can be taken from Kentville to Halifax, I'm not entirely certain on a price but I believe it's in the area of 30-40$. Easy to find online though.  Rent at the cheapest is 300-400 a month if you have roommates. Can be as high as 600-800 a month if you want a decent location, or to live on your own. Halifax would be your best bet for a legitimate casino (1 hr drive)   Hope this helps"

So depending on how it went down, it is possible the first car might not even have noticed what happened behind her.  First thought  If there is anything on the road and you need to stop, you should pull over to the shoulder.   Second thought  What was the motorcycle doing that he didn't see the cars stopped on the road on a sunny day? I mean what if she had stopped for a person or a moose?"

If the brake lights on the KIA were off, it would have taken a bit of time to realize the car was stopped.

NovaScotia,3bs7l5,OrzBlueFog,2,Fri Jul 3 10:33:25 2015 UTC,"So far the science on it is that hydraulic fracturing can potentially induce minor earthquakes in seismically-sensitive areas. As Nova Scotia is not on any major fault lines, the risk is low that any earthquake, regardless of cause, would ever result in any damage.

MacLeod has been praised for his verbal precision, his lyric intensity and his use of simple, direct language that seems rooted in an oral tradition.

NovaScotia,3b9sp1,Agentburr,2,Sat Jun 27 03:52:00 2015 UTC,"A lot to cover, so I'll make it brief(ish) -  Hotels - I recommend either the Mariner King Inn or the Spinnaker Inn. Both excellent, both downtown, slight edge to the Mariner King if I had to choose.  Food - The Dockside Inn has a very good restaurant, great view. (The inn itself is okay.) Old Fish Factory also has very good eats. My personal choice for pizza in the area is Big Red's. It has a sweeter sauce that you won't find elsewhere. Excellent. The Galley in Chester is also very good, if you don't mind a 25-minute drive.  Sweet Treasures for ice cream. If you have a sweet tooth, try the Moon Mist ice cream if they have it in.  There are tons of reasons you should stay in Halifax for a Monday, but I'd need more info as to what you'd be looking for. Driving straight to Lunenburg is probably a good idea, though.  Regrettably, the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic will probably be out if you're working, but walking around downtown can be nice enough on its own. Hit the Ironworks Distillery if you can.   Run/bike - get to Keji if you can. Kejimkujik (KED-gee-ma-KOO-jik) Seaside has some of the most beautiful views on the South Shore (the main park is great too). It's about an hour away from Lunenburg, though, so time may be tight. Blue Rocks is more local, and very quaint if that's your sort of thing.  Eats in Halifax - try a donair. Halifax donairs are different things to donairs anywhere else in the world. Wonderful creations. Any King of Donair or Alexandra's Pizza will make an excellent donair for you. Your Father's Moustache on Spring Garden is an excellent pub as well. Henry House can be wonderful, but it also can be overcrawled by university students at that time of year. Stick to upstairs.  That's all I've got for now. Let me know if you want any followup.  (Disclaimer - some of my info may be out of date, as I haven't lived there for many years, but I've been back to visit in the meantime. Apologies if anything is different from what I've said. Enjoy your trip!)"
NovaScotia,3b9sp1,bcdm,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:19:00 2015 UTC,Thanks very much for the suggestions!  I figured after flying for about 5 hours to Halifax driving straight to Lunenburg and getting settled in might be the better option unless there was some activity or sight that is a must during the day.  I'm pretty open to anything really but then again I'll be there all Friday night walking around.  I'm still fairly young (mid 20's) so bars with university kids are fine if the drinks/atmosphere are good.
NovaScotia,3b9sp1,bcdm,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:50:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, getting rest on Monday is probably the best option. Halifax is a much livelier place on Friday nights.  Actually, now that I think of it, one detour on your drive down - you'll want to see Peggy's Cove. It's a detour of about 15 minutes, but absolutely worth it if you've never seen it before. Can't stress this enough - STAY OFF THE BLACK/WET ROCKS. The surf is unforgiving, and people have died from errant waves. But the beauty is unparalleled.   I suppose I should clarify - Henry House is a split restaurant/pub. The upstairs section is the higher-end section, well-made eats. The basement is the pub with above-average bar food and a great selection on tap. Either option is good.  No worries, let us know how it goes!"

NovaScotia,3b9sp1,TheRealCorngood,2,Mon Jun 29 01:40:44 2015 UTC,If the weather is nice I'd suggest following the #3 highway down the shore.  Lunenburg has a number of great eateries and pubs - and all in convenient walking distance. The Knot is a great place for a cold beer and pub food - it's also very popular with the locals! Additionally for a place to eat I'd suggest both the Grand Banker (my favourite when I'm in town) and Salt Shaker Deli.

I'll likely be staying at a Marriott hotel downtown. If there was one place you could eat at in Halifax, what would it be? From yelp, I noticed that the poutine from Willy's is a must. Are there any other restaurants that compete? Don't worry, I have a pretty large appetite so 3 or 4 courses is doable, haha.   Oh one other note - in Halifax I'd suggest Stillwell as an establishment to visit. All craft brews on tap in a fun setting with pretty good food too!"

I don't think fracking solves either of those problems. it will create a few jobs but how will it reduce the cost of living? The government focuses on revenue from the wrong sources. Create an environment that encourages business, not by giving millions of dollars to people(Irvings) that don't need it. Small to medium size businesses are the backbones of an economy.  Even the shipbuilding contracts will ebb and flow with the way the ships will get built. There will be a constant laying off and rehiring of people based on the stage of construction the ships will be in."
NovaScotia,3b7g1h,Blitzman123,3,Fri Jun 26 18:28:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying fracking is the solution, but natural gas could be a cheaper solution to heating, create legitimate competition for NS power.

She has 2 girls on staff that are paid in bud and unclaimed tips.  Second pay period, she hands me a minimum wage (minus tips) amount in cash.  I inquired about the missing taxes amount and she said that's how everyone was paid; which means she fraudulently withheld taxes from cash payment, which is already illegal.

Why not have toll schools, toll sidewalks, toll police, toll firement, toll health inspectors, toll nurses, toll beaches?  A perfect example of the sort of thinking with the selfish people running these things was when they let them clearcut all the trees along the pass for a few extra bucks. Then they had massive snow problems that made the road wildly dangerous at times. I am willing to bet that the extra money spent in emergency services was a massive multiple of the tiny amount of money gained from the clearcutting.

You must have two consecutive full year term positions before you can go to the job fair as a term rehire. Your experience will not apply to your seniority in Nova Scotia.  The rural school boards have more positions available usually. Look at ccrsb, tri-county, avrsb, ssrsb, Cape Breton or the csap the Acadian school board which has schools across the province. To teach in csap you usually have to be a native level speaker where it's slightly less strict in the other boards.

There are many teachers out here who are functionally bilingual, but not as many who can teach in the French schools (CSAP), or in French Immersion programs. Functionally bilingual will get you short-term contracts at best for (probably) years; fluently bilingual will make it much more likely to land a full-year term and a subsequent rehire.  Good luck!

For example, while a private management company, its still a public and critical service, and when they (threaten) to strike, shit happens. A couple of years ago they did (threaten), and got what they wanted. But (and I'm making up numbers here), $0.50/hr raise, * 40 * 4 is $80/mo. And their Blue Cross provided insurance just happened to go up $80/mo the same time.   I think training is paid for, and is provided by an arms length provider, but despite being trained, there is still a migration process over to a real job. With one graduating class a year, it might take up to a full year of no or casual work to get a position.  The nature of the position is you are personally an easily replaceable cog; if you annoy your manager and aren't happy with shaving hours and whatever shit they pull, I suppose you can complain... self-exiled out even further into the boonies will get you back to FT or OT, but you are further out in the boonies. I think even the paramedics that work in ERs go through the same company, so you really cant change employers.  You will not get a job in Halifax without years experience.  And the job itself... I don't think people burn out so much because of horrific trauma they see, but the day to day drudgery of dragging drunks or addicts to the ER.

NovaScotia,3afqwq,JDGumby,-1,Fri Jun 19 20:08:44 2015 UTC,Makes no sense on pay the wages these folks make. It's not competitive with the rest of the marketplace and higher wages don't mean higher quality. At least with private contractor you can build in a level of service that can dealt with contractually. Unionized workers have more excuses than answers and unfortunately the only answer they ever have is adding more labour. Take pride in your work. As far as Tim's employees they should not be getting paid $18 an hour. That business model does not operate on that much that's why EVERY other private Tim's makes money. $18 an hour plus about another 25% in benefits and pension that's more than double what private Tim's workers make. So just double the cost of coffee at the hospital locations and it should all work out right?
NovaScotia,3ac5yx,Zepmac,12,Thu Jun 18 22:21:57 2015 UTC,"Uhh I'm not sure about Nightlife, but Cape Breton has 2 of the most beautiful golf courses in the world. One is Cabot Links in Inverness, where the PGA Tour will be this year, it's brand new and recently made a list of the best courses in the world. Inverness is a small town of like 2,500 people but there are a few pubs around with fiddle music and things like that...The entire town is on a 15km long sandy beach where the water gets to 24 degrees C (as warm as the water in Atlanta), it's a very pretty spot.  Another is Highlands Links in Ingonish, which is an even smaller town, but there is a resort and lodge with plenty of booze right on the course, as well as Ingonish Beach, and a shit ton of hiking trails, waterfalls and other beaches, it's in a National Park of Canada.  Both are also right next to campgrounds that will be packed with friendly locals and tourists all summer long, filled with people drinking like crazy and are also next to small pubs that have live fiddle music any night of the week, which is probably the best way to experience the province if you won't be downtown Halifax.  Both of these courses are on the Cabot Trail which is one of the most beautiful drives in the world. You could do both on the weekend staying in each town. They're both an hour apart. Also along the Cabot Trail is an organic craft beer brewery and the oldest single malt whisky distillery in North America, they both make great stops.  We don't have much of a nightlife here, but we do love to drink"

NovaScotia,3ac5yx,C0lMustard,4,Sun Jun 21 20:40:35 2015 UTC,"As someone who does this twice a year I have three suggestions, and I've done them all.    Ingonish cape Breton, seriously one of the greatest golf courses in the world, highland links is as far east as you can drive on the continent. Its a remote mountain course, and I'd stay at ingonish chalets they have a 130/pp rate that includes a round of golf.  The drive is freaking long though and there isn't much there so stock up on booze an food because nothings open after 9.  Cavendish PEI, tons of cottages, a 15 min drive to 5 top shelf golf courses and 35 mins from 10.  Think a beach town mixed with myrtle beach.  The prices are higher than Ingonish, but there are bars restaurants etc... in town.  Still a seasonal vacation town though so don't expect times square.  Cabot links, super expensive and probably the greatest overall golf experience of my life.  This course is ranked 42 in the world now, and cabot cliffs is expected to open top 5 in the world.  In short if you are going drinking and golfing PEI, if you are going golfing and drinking cape breton.  Ask me any questions, I have seriously golfed almost every golf course in the maritimes and can give you insights like which courses offer bar shots on the drink cart."

NovaScotia,3ac5yx,bcdm,4,Fri Jun 19 19:35:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry, no. There are only three public courses within half an hour of Halifax, which is the only spot around for nightlife, and none of them are convenient to the city or each other.  You'd have better luck with Prince Edward Island - there are four courses close to Charlottetown. Of course, the tradeoff is that nightlife in the town is not very buzzing.  Or, as otherwise suggested, Florida/Arizona/California all are better-suited for what you're looking for."

NovaScotia,3ac5yx,Karai17,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:32:48 2015 UTC,"They both are sucky, not their fault, they were just built when golf clubs were made of wood. Short courses with small greens."

We have some golf courses but they aren't back-to-back, and none of them are near any night life areas. The only place in NS you'll find much night life would be Halifax, the rest of the province is basically rural by many's standards. If you want to get shitfaced and black out on a dozen golf courses, Florida is probably your best bet."

Ocean and lake water will be quite warm after soaking up the heat all summer. At the end of the month, one or two good storms can push out the warm weather and drop temperatures down towards about 15 during the day.  I have personally been swimming here October 13th, the ocean water was still 16, but that was probably an anomaly."

NovaScotia,39tgn6,PM_ME_YOUR_PHILLIPS,5,Sun Jun 14 16:46:47 2015 UTC,"If you're doing Cape Breton, that severely limits how much time you will have to explore the rest of the province, especially if you want to make the most of it and see the Cabot Trail and do some hikes. That can definitely be a 2-4 trip on its own.   So I think you need to narrow it down. Do you have literally zero plans so far? Or do you definitely plan on getting to Halifax, Lunenburg, the Valley, etc.?"
NovaScotia,39tgn6,fadetowhite,2,Sun Jun 14 19:39:05 2015 UTC,"I just finished up making plans (well, narrowing down) on what we could do. We primarily just want to see the wildlife and scenery and explore Nova Scotia, so that's why we want to just go to Cape Breton.  We were thinking we would stop at Ingonish, Nova Scotia and head down the Cabot Trail and visit the Skyline Trail, the Middle Head Trail, Cape Smokey, Bras d'Or Lake and Black Brook Beach, since you can take the Cabot Trail there.   We also want to find a way to incorporate a visit to Uisage Ban Falls in Baddeck (most likely on our way to Ingonish or back) and we want to visit Sydney for some yarn stores and Louisbourg for the lighthouse, but I don't know how to make the Sydney/Louisbourg work, since it's not along the way & you need to take a ferry there."
NovaScotia,39tgn6,HeliumPaper,3,Sun Jun 14 20:39:38 2015 UTC,"Baddeck is absolutely gorgeous all times of the year. I recommend going there for the Alexander Graham Bell museum and a trip on the Amoeba too. Bell Bay is a stellar golf course if you're into that, and Margaree is stunning just to drive through, the acadian culture is rich there. Also the Fortress of Louisbourg is great too!"
NovaScotia,39tgn6,fadetowhite,2,Mon Jun 15 11:39:14 2015 UTC,"Perfect. I think that is smart. Sticking to Cape Breton will allow you to see a lot of scenery and wildlife.

If you're looking for places to explore, going north along the coast (number 7 highway) is a great idea. Clam Harbour is massive, relatively warm, but tourist-ey. Taylor's Head beach is a lot more reserved, quiet, and untamed, and it has a lot more uninhabited land nearby to hike. The entire East Coast north of Halifax is essentially wild land, much less inhabited and developed than down south in areas like Lunenburg and the Valley."

I'm Australian but had a US license and swapped it last week for an NS license in about 20 minutes.   Cost like 80 for 6 years but The lady behind the desk said if I had swapped an oz license it would only be $15 due to a bilateral agreement. NZ may be the same.
NovaScotia,39ijl8,grshirley,2,Thu Jun 11 23:54:51 2015 UTC,"According to their site, NZ licences require full testing. Only the USA and Germany qualify for a straight swap.

NovaScotia,39ijl8,ShepRat,3,Fri Jun 12 00:27:58 2015 UTC,"The information coming from their seems to be a bit shambolic because I've had to take my full test to change my Aussie licence.  You can get a Nova Scotian licence if you just take the written test, but it will have a restricted condition.  It is something like $14 to sit the test and it is pretty easy, I walked in and took it without studying and failed by 1 point (I didn't realise I'd have to take it and thought I'd risk it since I was there, again the info isn't always spot on when calling them).  I read the study materials on the Access Nova Scotia website for about half an hour, went back the next day and got 100%.  The restricted licence will let you register a vehicle if your Kiwi one doesn't.  Once you take the road test they just remove the restricted condition on your licence and give you a new card.  The restricted condition means that while driving under that licence, there must be another licensed driver in the car.  This would not affect you since you are still eligible to drive under your New Zealand licence."

There are A LOT of rural locations in the province - which means you are stranded for a long while when it comes to CAA and help to get back in. Make sure when you rent that the company gives you the ONSTAR codes to unlock remotely (if the car is so equipped). We spent a lot of lost time on the phone with the rental company head office in the States trying to explain where we were and how far from the nearest rental agency/major centre we were. We also experienced issues with the rental agency (located at the airport) being opened only during certain hours and thus, had no one to verify any info about the car after hours.  Barring that, keep your rental car info on your person and not in the vehicle in case you lock yourself out.   **We rented with Budget.  All rental car agencies jack their rates in high season so it's not that competitive. We've also been left without a car when our flight was delayed past the pick up time.   Good luck.  Have fun!"

It's a beef with the geographically challenged rental companies. The operator asked me if we were near Sydney...Australia!! Yes, I rented the car, had it shipped in a shipping container across the equator and fourteen time zones - at great personal cost - in two days.  Never mind explaining the Cabot Trail and the address where we were. *le sigh"

NovaScotia,3986mc,erythros,2,Wed Jun 10 10:53:02 2015 UTC,"Typical, the HRM to the county is like Ottawa to Nova Scotia. Amalgamation was terrible for the county, taxes went up services went down.  We'll soon get the privelege of paying for bike paths for people downtown in addition to their new library."
NovaScotia,3986mc,C0lMustard,4,Wed Jun 10 02:29:01 2015 UTC,You think rural people are subsidizing downtown? You've got it backwards.
NovaScotia,3986mc,erythros,2,Wed Jun 10 05:53:01 2015 UTC,"They are, there's a reason that the hrm drug it's feet on the rural tax rate and finally relented.  And its not enough, there are no water, or sewage services, no library, no pool/recreation services, no low income housing, no shelters or support facilities.  No sidewalks, or curbs.    The only two services the county gained was full time firefighters vs volunteer which is a debatable service increase and a daily bus, that was handeled privately before metro transit was involved."
NovaScotia,3986mc,C0lMustard,2,Wed Jun 10 08:51:32 2015 UTC,"The reason rural communities don't have all those things is because they hardly pay any taxes and it's far more expensive to provide those things in rural areas than downtown. Nevertheless, taxes are based on property values rather than service costs, which has lead to the peninsula paying five times what it receives in services in taxes and other areas receiving five times in services what it pays in taxes (at least, those were the figures given to me by an HRM employee a few years ago).  The reason is political. The peninsula is in the minority and people outside the peninsula flip out at the slightest possibility of a tax increase, whereas people on the peninsula are relatively apathetic about the issue. Also, HRM was created explicitly so that Halifax would have to subsidize everyone else."
NovaScotia,3986mc,erythros,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:40:31 2015 UTC,"That is simply not true, rural residents pay much more for less services and spotty service when its provided.  What the penninsula has is business taxes.    Look at Enfield, they pay significantly less tax than fall river, tantallon and the eastern shore. Yet they have all of the same services that rural people recieve."
NovaScotia,3986mc,C0lMustard,2,Thu Jun 11 00:37:17 2015 UTC,"Enfield is subsidized. So are Tantallon and the Eastern Shore. You have no idea how expensive it is to deliver water and collect garbage from these sparsely populated places.  EDIT: My mistake. Enfield isn't in HRM. I missed your point. Although, Enfield is subsidized by downtown Halifax through the province. I'm not sure why Enfield would get more services than rural and suburban parts of HRM. I can only guess. I only know that generally, the downtown subsidizes the rural parts of the HRM.  If I had to guess though, I would say that Enfield actually gets less services than Fall river, etc. Another possibility is that it is much cheaper to deliver services to do its proximity to the airport."
NovaScotia,3986mc,erythros,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:10:38 2015 UTC,By who? The province? In that case the hrm is subsidized too.

That's my point, they don't pay for the services they don't recieve.  Services like water, sewage, sidewalks, sidewalk cleaning, sweeper trucks, architecturally significant libraries, outdoor skating parks, recreation centers, I could go on and on.    Sure it may cost more per capita for snow removal (which i don't believe is true, as they don't take sidewalk cleaning and trucking snow away into account).  But the total cost is less, as demonstrated in the disparity of enfields taxes vs a town like porters lake."

But, there isn't a whole lot going on work depending on your skills and everything is fairly expensive here. If you can find a good job that pays well you won't get rich fast but you will get to enjoy a lot of the stuff this province has to offer without going broke. But on the bright side it's absolutely a buyers market for homes in most areas. There are homes and properties worth an easy 200 000 not even selling for 120 000.

Liquor on a sunday? better get to the store before 6. want good food at 3 am? better be okay with pizza. you will go to the store and see the same people over and over and over again. but that may be exactly what you are looking for.

I don't know a single person who thinks that he is anything but exactly more of the same.   The tories want to get in because they their supporters haven't had their turn at the trough for a long time.   The horrible thing is that at this point our alternatives are Baille wins because the we want to throw the bum liberals out, or McNeil wins because we can't be bothered to replace him with a different steaming pile of shit.  So all I can say is that I look forward to when the first real batch of Liberals end up getting caught in the usual pathetic NS style scandals of giving too much to their friends and family or just good old book cooking. My main hope is that whatever patheticness they get up to is caught on video and goes internationally viral.  And his blaming the hit on a hard-nosed budget is just sad.

My problem is that I have met a handful of politicians before they entered politics. Some of them seemed like they were going to kick ass and take names. It was shocking how quickly they drank the kool-aid. I will admit that there are many issues that have no easy answer but in many cases they gave in on the issues that clearly did; issues where the public interest was pretty much exactly the opposite of what they then did.  In at least one of these cases it is not an issue of donor money as his donors were tiny, numerous, and about as pure of heart as one could hope.  So it isn't just the individual politician there is something systemically wrong. But what exactly I can't seem to understand. What I would love would be to have a documentary crew follow a new politician into politics with the intent of finding what force seems to corrupt them pretty much as they walk through the door.  As for my running, I might have an arrogant sounding username but I chose it as more of an opposite of who I am and what I believe. Plus poopyface was taken."

But I can say, it is in theory that all NS roads are cleared in winter, at least center line bare. in practice this is obviously not true, but is more or less effectively true on more or less flat sections, and not-flat sections get attention from plows. Lesser traveled  roads will be passable, if packed snow.  2, 3 days after even the worst storm in Halifax last winter, anything that wasn't a stupid high performance sports car could get around.  With winter tires, being prepared to shovel your own driveway, and maybe prepared to wait 2, 3 days to get streets bare (or packed down), any vehicle is good enough."

NovaScotia,38ib3v,OrzBlueFog,0,Fri Jun 5 00:48:31 2015 UTC,"That bit about Maine contradicts all available information. Not even the NDP are refuting claims that Dexter got a bad deal.    I am just telling you the truth. I am refuting it, Dexter had a very specific deal and the Liberals changed it. They openly changed it and announced ""how much better they made it"".    You got a source for that information about Maine's contributions being a funding prerequisites?   Sure do. Again this is on the Liberals, it is their baby now they changed the deal, they fought this, this is their mess.    The original contract for the ferry operators required Nova Star Cruises to prove that Maine had agreed to provide $5 million to the service. But one month before the ferry began its run, the province deleted that clause from the contract.   http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1288574-nova-star-unlikely-to-get-support-from-maine-taxpayers"

People don't hate the Ferry they hate this deal.   Aside from the Maine payout, what was changed?   21 Million over 1 year instead of 7 years. Supplies purchased in Maine instead of NS, their was a condition they find winter work or pay for winter space themselves that was changed.

These deductions:   must not take the employee’s gross wages below minimum wage must be authorized by a clear agreement between the employer and the employee  (deductions are authorized by the employee when there is a written agreement or when the employee has acted in a way that shows he/she accepts the deduction - we recommend that employers use written authorizations for all such deductions)""   So, in other words, if that was part of the employment contract, then yes, it is legal to charge for losses.   If it was not part of the contract, but the server did not complain or challenge the charge, then it was also legal, as ""the employee has acted in a way that shows he/she accepts the deduction.""  If it was not part of the employment contract, and the server has not acted in a way to show that he has accepted the deduction, then he should bring it up to the Labour Standards Board.

Also a lot of the staff there (though not all) seem very disinterested and only paying at most half attention to whatever they are doing.   I had a friend continuously have to remind the doctors there that he was allergic to codeine and not to give him Tylenol 3s.   Had another friend get really sick because they were given too much morphene because multiple nurses/doctors gave her some while not noting or telling anyone.   Had my own thumb blown open by an over pressurized glass bottle exploding. Went to their ER. They just sent me home. I went home l, continued to bleed and got sick and went back. The new doctor i saw couldn't believe I had been sent home and stitched my thumb closed.    Friend went in to get a simple needle for immunization or something. The nurse hit a nerve and my friend lost mobility in her arm for almost a month.   They also have a bad reputation in the local community for prescribing things like Percocet and dilaudeds to kids who really don't need them, and for prescribing drugs they make a commission off of for ailments that might/might not even be covered by said medication."

NovaScotia,36dqzu,EmperorOfCanada,2,Mon May 18 19:20:48 2015 UTC,At least you aren't in New Brunswick. Years ago my sister moved there from BC.

So her question was to fly back to BC just to renew her licence or jump through their hoops. She was finishing her graduate degree so her finances answered for her.  The above is no small thing as her insurance is partially based upon number of years driving and the new licence would have effectively knocked off a decade. Plus with the whole points thing she would then be one speeding ticket away from losing it.

NovaScotia,3506sp,JDGumby,1 point,Wed May 6 00:37:18 2015 UTC,"I have long predicted that you will be able to watch NS come apart as it struggles to deal with elder-care.  I can see wave after wave of terrible government policy with huge numbers of the elderly paying the price. I can see all kinds of punitive billing situations where one spouse will develop dementia at say age 60 and the government will insist on emptying the bank accounts of the healthy spouse while providing little choice for care. Then the healthy spouse will be penniless and a burden to the system pretty much immediately while suffering a terrible quality of life.  Next I can see some private companies actually trying to do a good job for a reasonable price; but then the government will step in and impose their own values destroying these facilities. For instance I could see a near cooperative style arrangement with a group of similar demographic people living together and then the government insisting that they take pro-bono unmanageable cases that simply destroy the happy retirement place.  But then as the money really runs out (say 20 years from now) it will be simple abusive warehousing in prison-like conditions.  But the final level of collapse will be when the government is viciously pursuing whistle-blowers for violating new ""medical ethics"" laws when they document the squalor that many of the elderly live in.  But all along the whole path a few well connected companies will have bountiful harvests of taxpayer money.  But where the key mistake will happen is that nearly every policy from this day on will result in a slow draining of the richest of the elderly taking off for other locations where their money will go further both due to better facilities and due to lower taxes on their wealth. This slow but steady drain will brutalize budgets. This will also be combined with a continuation of the government's ongoing war against youth. Youth who, if they didn't run to other provinces, would become the tax base from which to pay for elder-care.  This is all well symptom'd as you will see more and more polices that benefit the elderly voter but generally poorer elderly voters. Things such as free transit, lower speed limits, cutting costs like schools, frozen property taxes, rental laws that will benefit the elderly, discount drugs, etc. Each of these laws will seemingly buy some more votes in the next election but will push even more youth to go on strike by moving west."

Having said that, landlords are in the property management business...not the social services business.

It was obvious to me that they had done this before.  I'm running things now for them, and I'm running things as they should be...like a business.  I agree with every single one of your points, and it's highly unlikely that I'll rent to them either. I'd rather leave an apartment empty for a month or two, rather than take on that kind of headache and financial risk.    The last time I checked, the housing rate for an individual was around $540 a month.  You typically can't get a bachelor/1 bedroom for that much in HRM.

I see massive waste in the system from blank cheque writing social workers. Obviously in every system there is room for efficiency. I don't advocate for throwing people on the street or blanket decisions not based on facts.   Can we at least agree that the billion dollar business of community services could use scrutiny. We have to ensure people who really need the services get the help they need coupled with support to move forward quickly. Some services and payments definitely need to go as they feel like they are needed but do little in the real world to achieving their goal. Facts guiding policy. It's not hard.

This kind of respiratory distress is so far outside of the scope of the course he was taking, it's laughable.

The social assistance rates are simply too low and the risk too high for me to comfortably make a business decision to rent to one.  In my experience, If you rent a place without the utilities included, they'll eventually fall behind on their bills, the heat stops, and the pipes freeze.  If you rent a place with the utilities included, the heat will always be on, and when they get hot, they'll open the windows instead of turning it down.  In those rare 'too good to be true' occasions where they pay the rent on time, you find out later that it's because they're substituting their income assistance with criminal activity or prostitution...which has a whole new set of problems associated with it.  I won't even get into how hard it can be to actually evict a problem tenant. 15 day notice to quit when they're 15 days late in rent...yeah right...more like 2-3 months with no rent paid by the time you get rid of them and jump through the administrative hurdles.  I won't say I'll 'never' rent to someone on social assistance because the government has conveniently made discriminating against them part of the human rights act, while at the same time, abdicating their responsibility to provide a social assistance rate that's actually survivable on."

They cut a ton which the Liberals ran against promising to reverse and have in some ways. Your 66 million extra a year into Education and your 30 million a year for the Yarmouth Ferry adds 100 million a year to the books.

To say this government is the first to make tough choices ignores the fact the NDP made much tougher choices and paid for it. I expect the Liberals will get the same treatment for throwing what will be 100 million into a Ferry that is outdated along with other political decisions that went tough at all.

NovaScotia,3414fu,Oblagon,2,Thu Apr 30 15:26:21 2015 UTC,"The problem with the province is that taxes are too high and the government is interfering too much in the market place. Simply put, Nova Scotia is a shitty place to do business. The government needs to get out of the way.  The tax credit is good because it lowers taxes for one industry. It would be nice if all industries could have their taxes lowered, but some is better than none.  Part of lowering taxes means that spending needs to be reduced. This means getting rid of civil servants. They may be hardworking, but they aren't needed.   To Mr McNeil, you do get that before we can save tax dollars we need to have jobs to tax.    After-tax income is positive. In other words, income taxes are less than the income being taxed. If the income is being paid by the government, it certainly does save the government money to no longer pay that income even though it also loses the tax revenue.   Unemployment is higher than ever in this province, with the Alberta energy sector draining and this provincial government seems to not really care. And now, the already overwhelmed public sector has even less support. This is a scary move because, with the rising cost of groceries, it looks like we will ALL be on food stamps soon enough.   The civil service is not a charity. And these people will find other jobs. Taxes need to be lowered so that the private sector can succeed."

They get bigger wage increases, have better benefits that includes more paid leave and a much better pension.  Then add to that the highest provicial taxes in the country, and the generally inneffective dealings that people have when they are forced to interact with the government.  People are losing jobs left and right and there's the NSGEU building a brand new 40million dollar HQ."

I mean social workers get two weeks paid leave and usually are still on call primarily on holidays such as Christmas. Salaries for even DM positions are under 40$ per hour and my father is going to have to work till he's 85 with his pension. Talk about extravagant living. To say that the public sector is cushy/ better than private sector is laughable. I also don't really understand how overwhelming our public servants will make them any more efficient."

In fact, fresh out of highschool I was making almost half that as a customer service rep. It's a middle class salary, and I think that that's very reasonable considering the training and workload that comes with these positions. I'm not saying civil servants are poverty stricken, though this myth of the over indulgent civil servant is just plain silly. what I am saying is these other job cuts (public service, tourism, rural development) are beyond marginalized because everyone only cares about the film tax credit. And call me crazy but I kind of think child protection and welfare is a bit more important...

NovaScotia,3414fu,erythros,5,Thu Apr 30 15:29:47 2015 UTC,"This sounds improbable, but they are good talking points in terms of understanding why people perceive the public service in a negative light.  I'm not intimately familiar with the hiring rules for the NS public sector, but I've worked in federal public sector jobs and I can tell you that it would be next to impossible for the government to stack the civil service except in the relatively few top end patronage positions in each department.  Public sector hiring is truly painfully open, it is very hard to influence who is hired or even to negotiate with prospective candidates since the rules are very restrictive.  Ultimately the hiring manager has significant say, but they're invariably part of a board, and it's quite unheard of to have somebody from the government reach down into the department and influence hiring in the way you are implying.  If it was happening, it would be in the news.  You're basically saying that the NDP stacked the civil service so that they could pour money into their department coffers via kickbacks from patronage.  This is crazy ass tin foil hat level paranoia.  One can argue that the civil service in general is less efficient than we would like, but the idea that it's somehow simply a drain and not a benefit neglects the fact that civil servants are the ones providing the services that all governments promise in order to get elected.  All organizations have cost centres and revenue centres and you don't generally want to have the civil service acting as a revenue generating organization if your goal is to have service delivered fairly and without bias toward the wealthy."

You will cross two islands to get to Brier Island, taking two ferries - which is a fun experience and a good spot for photos. Walking around Brier Island while you are there will give you a glimpse of a small fishing village.  Moving further down the province but in the same area are the charming small town of Annapolis Royal with the beautiful Historic Garfpdens complete with an Acadian house. Near Annapolis Royal you can visit Port Royal which was Champlain's settlement and Fort Anne which was the British fort in the area. Digby itself is a pretty fishing town with good scallops and fish and chips. If you are interested in tidal power you can visit a tidal power plant in Annapolis Royal."

It's on the North side of the Annapolis Valley.  Small parking area is about right here, the path also starts there.  There is a well worn path that goes out to the very end of the cape.  Picture from the air  Halifax has several old British Forts, the most well known is The Halifax Citadel. I believe there are tours, although its been a while since I've been there. Also a cannon is fired every day at noon with the sole purpose of scaring tourists.  Point Pleasant Park also has many fort structures still standing although not many you can enter.  York Redoubt is another of our forts.  MacNab's Island in the middle of the harbour also has several old forts but most are in a state of decay.  Maritime Museum of the Atlantic is in downtown Halifax as well. Its a good size and dedicated to shipping, boats, and disasters around our waters. We were the closest port when the Titanic went down, and our harbour is the site of the largest explosion before nuclear weapons were developed.  If you happen to find yourself up in Cape Breton there is also Fort Louisbourg. Its well maintained French fort. There's tours, actors, and some shops."

MacNab's is another story, the buildings were blocked off with brick in the doorways and windows but even that is crumbling away. There's usually almost nobody on the island so there's nothing stopping you from entering. Its just probably not the best idea. The outer walls looked fine when I was there a decade ago but the ceilings had chunks missing, and holes in some spots. Salt air, and over a century of disrepair have probably left them unstable.

However, they can get pretty packed at times.  Cape Split is a great hike. Out past Canning towards the Bay of Fundy. It's situated along the Minas Basin. It's a great hike with some spectacular basalt cliffs at the end.  There are some really good wine tasting tours throughout the Annapolis Valley.

About blue beach - you mentioned fossil hunting... is it a formal set up where kids go out with a few tools and get to take home their haul? or is this more informal, with there being so many fossils being present and just an opportunity to come across some?"
NovaScotia,32xwts,amyatla,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:34:53 2015 UTC,"Not really digging,  it's really just a diagonally exposed Cliffside of shale/sedimentary rock that you can literally walk up to and grab a chunk off of and sort through the layers like a deck of cards in search of fossils.  The way the rocks are exposed,  the further you walk down the beach,  the further you are going back in time.  It was actually featured in an episode of Neil Degrasse Tyson's ""The Cosmos"" series (on Netflix,  highly recommend). Every year parts of the cliff collapse,  exposing new possibilities for discovery. It's a super cool spot.  I think it's frowned upon to take stuff from the beach,  especially if its a significant find.  If you do find something really cool, bring it up the road to the nearby museum. The guy who runs it has devoted his life to collecting some amazing things there. Here's the dude's website.

Also, for viking expeditions, you won't find anything in NS. There was one Icelandic settlement in the late 1800s or early 1900s, but that's not exactly what you're looking for. Head up to L'Anse-aux-Meadows in Newfoundland for that.

I would suggest heading to Shubenacadie Wildlife Park - you can see a lot of the native fauna there, including Sable Island horses, wolves, and probably falcons and hawks.  It's not really invasive - the animals are brought to the park either because they are too used to people to survive in the wild, or suffered a debilitating injury/illness that left them unable to fend for themselves. There is a lot of care taken to make sure the animals are not stressed and their enclosures suit them."

Baby would nurse and all would be good (no loud movies). This lasted for a few weeks but then baby simply crossed that threshold where it wouldn't sleep and stay quiet so the moment the baby made one noise I whisked it out and walked baby in the hallway for the last 20 minutes of the movie.   About 10 minutes into my walking the movie staff came to me, gave me a pile of free movie passes and asked if I would like a free drink.

NovaScotia,32wip5,CodeNewfie,-11,Fri Apr 17 15:49:18 2015 UTC,"Edit - Ok, downvotes are fine, though I'm not breaking Reddiquette so I don't understand why I  deserve them.  But do none of you have an actual response? I stated my opinion on the topic - though I'm not actually encouraging parents to bring screaming children into fine dining establishments. The legitimate question of what legal precedent an establishment can use to deny service to children remains completely unanswered.  I don't have children, and I'm as annoyed as the next person at screaming kids. But my question is this:  What right does any establishment have to discriminate or deny service in this country to any person under the law? I'm not talking about the parents. I'm talking about the kid. They're damn well people too, regardless of whether or not they have a drivers license or pay taxes. They are people and they often can't simply be told ""don't cry"" or ""don't misbehave."" Sure some or better than others, but even ""good"" kids have their moments. Don't children have every right to reasonably  patronize businesses and services (as long as the environment isn't harmful to their health and development, and they aren't purposefully disruptive to other patrons), as much as the next person?   Any restaurant or business that has a sign advertising that they will willfully discriminate based on a person's inborn attributes - especially those which they cannot help (which infants and even young children simply cannot) - should frankly be fined into oblivion until the policy is removed.   On a side note, I  want Canadian kids to grow into adults who can behave themselves in public (and not just at a McDonalds). It seems to me that policies like this rob parents of the opportunity to teach their children critical life skills. Those lessons will serve me well in the future when these kids are asked to pay taxes and get drivers licenses."
NovaScotia,32wip5,kayriss,5,Fri Apr 17 12:03:57 2015 UTC,"Because kids taking a temper tantrum in a restaurant is disruptive and annoying. Not all parents will try to stop a screeching child, unfortunately some will just ignore it.  I wish more restaurants would do this actually, it's not fair to the other paying customers who are there to enjoy their meal, not listen to a child kick and shout over some petty issue.  It would be the same if an adult or teenager did this. If I went into a restaurant and started crying/screaming/throwing things do you think I should still be served as a customer? I didn't think so.  Although I'm not one of them, some people choose not to have kids. It's not fair to subject someone, who paid for a meal, to sit through a cranky kid, that isn't even related to them, hit the highest octave possible in a cringe-worthy squeal because they didn't want to eat their carrots."
NovaScotia,32wip5,strawili,-2,Fri Apr 17 15:12:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, ok, that is fine - but that's not my point. I certainly don't disagree with you. A screaming kid should be asked to leave, and a responsible parent should really remove them before being asked.   But to disallow kids from an establishment altogether? To not give a family even the option to enter the premises? That seems out of line to me."
NovaScotia,32wip5,kayriss,0,Fri Apr 17 15:16:33 2015 UTC,"Except that's not what they did.  They banned small, screaming children. Meaning your kids are allowed if they behave. If they start to take a tantrum they'll be asked to leave.  No one said they are banning children altogether."
NovaScotia,32wip5,strawili,-1,Fri Apr 17 15:36:09 2015 UTC,"That is not at all clear from the article. It may be the case in the CB restaurant, granted, but the overall theme is clearly one of ""kid banning,"" emphasized by the ""No Strollers - No High Chairs - No Booster Seats"" graphic, plus the described intentional lack of changing tables.   I doubt a restaurant could get away with removing a wheelchair ramp on the basis that the owners or clientele aren't fond of disabled people.   I really didn't expect to be on the minority side of this. The National Post comment section is rarely high brow, but the vitriol against children there really surprises me."
NovaScotia,32wip5,kayriss,2,Fri Apr 17 15:47:59 2015 UTC,"Effective as of now, we will no longer allow small, screaming children,” read a Sunday night post   And from like-minded restaurants;   “While we do allow attended, well behaved children, anyone disturbing others will be asked to respect other patrons,”   and   “We don’t ban them, we don’t say you can’t have the little suckers, but if you have ‘em you’ve got to make ‘em mind,”   Just because they don't supply booster seats, high chairs, or strollers (why the hell would they have strollers?) doesn't mean kids aren't welcome.

Not when going down a steep hill, not when you're just past the speed limit sign, not if you're trying to pass someone. You will fail. Stay a few km under at all times.  Don't do a rolling stop through a stop sign.  Be super obvious when you're checking your mirrors, and when glancing down side streets for oncoming traffic. You might be able to check while just moving your eyes, but the tester won't know that.  Don't change lanes in the middle of an intersection. Know what lane you're supposed to be in, and don't cross lines.  Shoulder check if you have to merge.  Figure out when you're supposed to signal.

NovaScotia,32syr7,mikeyo73,-1,Thu Apr 16 13:45:19 2015 UTC,"I refer to the upper level as the ""departure lounge"".  To me there should be a simple point system with the highest point vendors getting to choose their location (including displacing existing vendors)   The most points should be awarded to those who sell local farm products or products derived from local farms.  Second should be their popularity by sales volume as compared to previous vendors in the same spot and adjacent vendors. Third should be their popularity by number of customers as compared to previous vendors in the same spot and adjacent vendors. Fourth should be a few points awarded by vote.   There should be no other criteria. Once the market people start to ""pick winners"" that place is fucked. Let the consumers pick the winners.   On this last note there should be space dedicated to new potential vendors. This way new blood could come along and have a chance to get the points to push some crappy vendor out.   One of the beauties of my above system is that a vendor that earned a pile of points might not want to displace a vendor from a key spot if they thought that they might not earn as much in that spot as it would cost them some serious points allowing them to quickly be displaced.  But my pick a location in order of the points would allow the vendors to decide if they want to group or not or even if one vendor wants to go away from the group.  To me one of my long term worries is that someone will run the market with a soul focus on cruise ships and this will result in all plastic lobsters wearing NS tartan vendors.  You might notice that I don't award any points for locally made products that aren't made from local farm products. I really don't want another ""jewelry artist"" twisting silver wire around some beads. But someone knitting something made from local wool is fine."

I suspect that the NDP are done for the time being (maybe 30 years) so it will be pretty much Liberal, Tory, Liberal, Tory for a long while with hopefully a few minority governments in there for variety.   I was listening to Baby Head (AKA Jamie Baillie) on the radio and I could just hear the glee in his voice. He is about as voter friendly as a bloody turd but he knows that regardless of how badly he stinks that the next election is in the bag. All he has to do is wait for the clock to run out; the liberals will take care of the rest with screwups like the Film tax credit, the ferry, the roads, whatever the hell is really going on with Younger, and the mega deficit they are going to run in the next few years.   Then he can promise to undo all their terrible wrongs; yet the only wrongs he will undo is that they didn't appoint his friends and give them slush fund money.

But it is almost reaching a point where the system is being set up so that you can't.   For instance there are more and more rules that prevent people from doing pretty much anything. But then the government will claim that it doesn't stand in the way of business and will grand waivers left and right; to their friends.  A great example is how their are moving some of the Film money to NSBI which will then ""choose"" who gets the money instead of simply having a clear set of rules where anyone can qualify. So now I am willing to bet that only two groups of people will ""qualify"" one will be very big companies that know how to play the game. Second will be weird little firms that don't even makes sense in their existence until you realize that they are almost entirely propelled by government money.  Now take nearly every area of growth or high potential (mining, land development, manufacturing, interesting tourism) and you will find a government department that can stand solidly in your way unless you have the clout to brush them aside.   But the real icing on the cake is if you stumble through the system and are somehow willing to pay the crazy high taxes (because you won't get the tax breaks without connections or power) then there is a great chance that a group of funding/aid agencies will fund your immediate competitor. Then you will go to your next trade show only to find that while you have a 8x10 booth they have a 20x20 booth that is an architectural wonder; where did they get that money; from government grants for ""marketing"". Then you will find that they are in a prime commercial rental spot and you are competing for the few local employees in your area of business. Then the government will switch and they will fail horribly.

NovaScotia,31npjp,iwasnotarobot,8,Mon Apr 6 18:58:17 2015 UTC,"To me this all boils down to a feudal philosophy of ""They are lucky to have a job.""  But the reality is that young workers in this province have been going on strike for a long time; their walkout involves going to Ontario, Alberta, and BC.   Quite simply the province needs to do a handful of things. First end the TFW program in its entirety. Next minimum wage needs go way way up. I would go to $15/hour tomorrow and work up to something closer to $20 within a few years. $20 /hour at the typical of 1700 hours worked per year is $34,000 which is still not enough for a single breadwinner to raise a family.   Then the tax system needs to be completely reworked. Basically tax breaks should be reserved for businesses that are clearly exporting things. This would encompass the present film tax credit but never apply to things like restaurants and law firms.   Typically jobs that involve exporting things are at least OK jobs and they bring real money to the province.   Then apprenticeships need to pretty much be a requirement to avoid even higher taxes. Any company not apprenticing the youth would find its upper management subject to near punitive tax rates.   But most importantly there needs to be a very progressive tax system where non exporting companies have their highest paid employees paying very high taxes. Thus a top dog at a law firm would pay tremendous taxes while a manager at Michelin would be doing fine on the tax front.   But to allow employers who are buying their kids a new BMW to go to university in while paying their part time employees minimum wage by arguing that for any job in the province there are 10 people waiting in line to take their place is just wrong.   To do the above would penalize a very few who can move if they want without doing any damage to NS while rewarding those who are willing to stay along with the real engines of the economy such as the manufactures and creators of value."
NovaScotia,31npjp,EmperorOfCanada,3,Tue Apr 7 01:47:25 2015 UTC,"The title of this article should be  ""Nova Scotia is in trouble and no government has a clue what to do about it."" The problem is that N.S. has a downward spiraling economy and nobody knows how to fix it.  The attack on labour is the provinces way of trying to fix the problem but it does not work.  Increasing minimum wage to $20 is not going to help either if businesses can not afford it.    Nova Scotia needs to make the province attractive for business and growth.  When the economic climate is healthy labour becomes healthy.  The reality is that business and labour go hand in hand.  When business does well so will labour. Part of the problem also lies with the Canadian culture.  The Canadian culture has always expected and waited for someone to come to our country and save us.  That is one of the reasons why immigration is so important in this country.  Immigrants  have the highest percentage of new businesses and successful businesses.  Canadians lack the industriousness of their southern neighbours.  I would like to know why the Conservative government is so eager to ship Canadian oil to the states so it can be refined in the US.  Why do not Canadians refine it them selves? Why is Canada minting coins and printing money on German made machines.  Canada should make its own machines to make its and other currencies.  Why is Irving building Norwegian designed ships to protect Canada.  Canada has the skill set to design its own ships.  The examples are endless.  There is no reason that Canada (including NS and all other provinces) can not be competitive on a global scale.  I think most of the blame lies with its citizens.  We are all to blame and our government is just a reflection of ourselves."

By all accounts the Film Tax Credit, regularly brings back five or six times its value through payroll taxes not to mention the sundry jobs created through the various needs of a filming TV show. From catering to carpentry to actual film related careers. In case you hadn't realized, jobs are something we're in short supply of and incentivizing this kind of work provides it. It also has a feedback effect that as our renown and expertise at all the roles involved in film-making mature we develop a trained pool of experts that will help ensure we keep getting this kind of work.  So please keep the credit, keep our jobs. Real honest jobs that don't involve a call center, a reason for people beneath the age of 55 to stay in this province. (Also Hello Joan and Ted, I figure one of you are reading this and or your assistant, if you are please would tell Diane to get back from her rip, and git 'er done would you, sorry for the email inbox but I hope your drowning in Trailer Park Boys Appeals).

NovaScotia,3152d4,Sir_Ass,2,Thu Apr 2 03:07:31 2015 UTC,"I suspect that the liberals know the next election is not going to go well for them. Other than some self delusion they know that unless they can turn the economy around they don't have a chance in hell.   The key to just about every political party's thinking is the scratch-and-win economics of offshore oil. Any party lucky enough to be in power if and when that comes to fruition will stay in power for a decade or two.   But today's oil prices have taken even the possibility of offshore oil out behind the woodshed.   As for the specific politics if you look at the election map after the NDP win the whole yarmouth digby area was all liberal so they were spanked with crappy roads, shut down schools, and a sunk ferry.  Then post liberal win they were rewarded for their loyalty with a new ferry.   To me this is classic NS government thinking that they can pick winners and preferably those winners are in loyal areas, and ideally those winners are connected to their loyal supporters.   So for instance I very much doubt that the ferry is the only ferry expense. There is no doubt some government department that either expanded or was created in relation to the ferry. That department would be a great place to send some party appointees as a reward.  BTW I am not trashing the liberals specifically, the Tories are salivating at the idea that the ferry will sink the liberals so that finally they can throw some business to the advertising agencies that have long been so loyal to their election efforts along with the plum appointments they can make for their various campaign managers and other party insiders. I suspect that if you were a fly on the wall inside the Tory HQ that there would be many conversations that basically would be how it is their god given right to be back in power and that it is just the way things have to be that they reward their faithful followers.   The reality of all this crap is that real companies that create real jobs are typically run by people who can see through this BS. And while this BS exists in all places, locally it is overwhelming good government and destroying the economy.  The government does fool people with non-stop lines of BS such as the potholes being blamed on the freeze thaw cycle but the reality is that it is corrupt construction companies dealing with corrupt officials. A counter-example for this very thing is that there are many mountainous places in the world where the sun raises the temperature of the asphalt to +10 which then plummets to -10 every day of the winter. Those roads are in near perfect condition because they built them properly.  But even better in this last example there are machines that can quickly and effectively fill potholes with a single machine and two men. Plus another crack filling technology that prevents them from developing in the first place. But in most places that they use these the municipality operates them, not contractors. Thus the roads last way too long for the happiness of the contractors who would much rather the roads come apart enough that a whole new paving job is required.  I read an article about NS becoming Detroit. I would say that NS will become more like Baltimore. The three things that really killed Baltimore were corruption, government meddling, and a complete disintegration of the public infrastructure (except for a few wasteful mega projects). With all the above problems any company of value moved away which then caused the few well connected rich elites to literally tear down the few real valuable things in Baltimore to turn them into playthings for themselves. This was sold to the population as urban renewal instead of the correct term of gutting the last hope of an economic revival.   So in NS how long before well connected rich boomer politicos allow the Port near point pleasant to be turned into a gated style condo community?  The ferry is not the problem, it is just a symptom. Killing the ferry project would be like giving sun cream to someone with skin cancer; while technically a good thing it is not going to solve the core problem."

NovaScotia,30zpz7,C0lMustard,16,Wed Apr 1 00:17:11 2015 UTC,They're investigating to get all the facts before assigning blame or even confirming a reason for the crash. ;)
NovaScotia,30zpz7,macfierce,12,Wed Apr 1 01:16:24 2015 UTC,"It's easy to jump to the conclusion that he pilot screwed up the landing... escpecially for those who aren't pilots.  In fact, it could well end up being the case. However... it's not the only possibility.  There could have been a problem with the aircraft altimeter, there could have been a micro burst down draft that pushed the aircraft down into the ground. The fact is, WE don't know what happened. That's why we have TSB investigations. Before we lay blame, let's get the facts."
NovaScotia,30zpz7,iamthefrogprince,0,Wed Apr 1 12:24:50 2015 UTC,All of those things are accounted for by landing well after the runway starts.  Take a drive down the old gysborough road and look for yourself.  That pilot made a shitty landing.
NovaScotia,30zpz7,nsrally,9,Thu Apr 2 04:16:32 2015 UTC,What's the nautical takeoff speed needed for that armchair you're piloting?  Let the people who know what they're talking about decide what happens. Focusing on what the media is saying is half your problem. They desperately need to keep the hyperbole train chugging along even if there's nothing to say yet.
NovaScotia,30zpz7,gmarsh23,2,Wed Apr 1 16:38:35 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt at all that it was pilot error.  Though my personal suspicion is that most other airports have better weather/visibility conditions on average compared to halifax, and ILS available for landing, and pilots these days have become spoiled by those things. Start taking those things away from a pilot so they have to start making unfamiliar decisions, and you're more likely to start getting bad decisions getting made..."
NovaScotia,30zpz7,cornerzcan,0,Wed Apr 1 15:08:56 2015 UTC,"Well your wrong, when was ils implemented?  I guarentee 20+ years after the airport was built.  There has never, in the history of the Airport, been a short landing until last weekend."
NovaScotia,30zpz7,ooburai,2,Thu Apr 2 04:20:53 2015 UTC,"There are SO MANY factors that contribute to an accident/crash that the final act of hitting the ground has very little to do with the cause. Lots of items will be listed as cause factors, and pilot error may be one of them, but systems that can make aviation safer and design elements of the aircraft will likely be cited as well. Human factors also include ATC, maintenance of NavAids, system design, an endless list. These investigations are not about blaming who made what mistake, but about learning the facts to prevent the next one. Having been aircrew in a plane that nearly crashed equally short of the runway, I am acutely aware of just how many things can go wrong, and how much the last minute actions of crew on board can, despite our possible earlier errors, can prevent a massive disaster from occurring."
NovaScotia,30zpz7,hellafax,-1,Wed Apr 1 17:55:01 2015 UTC,"Blah blah balh, drive down to the old gysborough road and look at what that dunbass did.  He/she was 12 feet from killing 300 people.  They have twice the runway they need and they hit the snowbank in front of the runway.  Also I heard today that the two flights before it landed elsewhere."
NovaScotia,30zpz7,SensDownvoter,3,Thu Apr 2 04:13:34 2015 UTC,"You're right that he screwed it up, but that said, my understanding is that Stanfield has the worst weather of any significant airport in Canada.  In fact the airport was built because the weather in Halifax County is so miserable for commercial flight.  It's long had a reputation amongst pilots as not being for the faint hearted.  There's no reason for this to have happened, but at the same time an airport like this should probably have ILS on both ends of its longest runway if they are going to be used during inclement weather.  If we want to live in an era where air travel is routine we need to make investments in the infrastructure to move it out of the 1970s."
NovaScotia,30zpz7,GeriatricPunk,3,Wed Apr 1 01:29:28 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure St Johns is the worst, crazy winds on the ocean.  That said I agree it would be good to get ILS on the other side, just to safeguard against pilot error.  Even then though what about the other runway for when the winds are perpendicular."

Re: the Portland ferry - we live in NJ and have considered taking it, but flying to Halifax costs the same. Also - no one here knows about the ferry. I can't speak for New England, maybe there are ads in the Boston-area all the time, but here - nothing and this is where large population of the American East Coast is.   When I tell people that my family is really looking forward to a Maritimes vacation, maybe people in my area of NYC-NJ-Philadelphia say ""where?"" Jokes about Americans bad geography aside, this is a marketing problem. I used to live along the Jersey Shore and they advertise heavily in Quebec. And every summer, we see a good amount of ""Je me souviens"" license plates.   But I don't think any place wants to bet its economy on just tourism alone. I know NS-NB-PEI might suffer from geographic isolation that is noted in the article, but what about using geography to your advantage?

NovaScotia,2zt2il,sneaker98,7,Sun Mar 22 01:07:29 2015 UTC,"I'm just some guy who grew up in Ontario and now owns a house in Halifax, but I'll chime in here.  Halifax, like many cities, does some things really well and others terribly. The ol' Maritimes charm is something Hali does extremely well - lots of old bars and historic properties that really give you a taste of the region's rich history. And the restaurant scene - I don't know what it is, but if you're in the mood for something, you'll find it here. Me and my SO have a restaurant for basically every urge. Indian? There's a sweet little place down by Bayers Lake (Dhaba? I think is it's name). In the mood for fish? Basically every restaurant along the boardwalk. Burgers? You wanna go to Darrel's, fellah! Etc, etc. Locals may take this for granted, but I've lived in a couple towns now and this is pretty unique outside of Toronto. Oh, and the Farmers market on weekends is something Hali got right - what a great place to spend a Sunday morning!  So, what does Halifax do wrong? Well, the article hit this nail on the head: aversion to change. This can play into positive results (read: historic properties), but can also be very, very detrimental (read: the Halifax transit redesign that's ongoing. People hate transit, but also hate changing transit. Go fucking figure.) There's a deep, deep mistrust of the government even if they're trying to do the right thing. Oh, and the urban sprawl - it's crazy here! People willingly live an hour's drive outside of town, but then expect a bus to their doorstop! Good lord, as a native Ontarian this boggles my mind.  Is it as bad as the article lays it out to be? Well, depends who you are. If you're a newly graduated student looking for work, then yeah. But if you do have a somewhat stable job, the ""American"" dream is still attainable here - decently affordable single-family homes sell for a fair price, unlike Toronto or Vancouver.  Personally, I love this place and will be sad to leave it when that day comes."

NovaScotia,2zt2il,iwasnotarobot,11,Tue Mar 24 02:21:55 2015 UTC,"I'll post my two cents here as well:  The Province has a big problem, there is barely any economic growth or activity outside of the city. Without the city this province is severely destitute. This means that Halifax is crucial to saving our economy. It's literally the only place to see any growth. The rural economy is inherently inefficient and as such, it can't even fight off decline yet alone demonstrate a modicum of growth.  We need dramatic legislative changes in this province. Dramatic cuts to rural services in an effort to reduce costs and encourage a migration of citizenship towards Halifax. From thereon, we need massive incentives for business creation -- I'm talking venture funds, startup incubators, etc. Make Halifax the new ""IT"" city for emerging young businesses. Not these corporate handouts that purchase jobs to only see them lost once the incentives wear out.  Will this happen? Likely not, as we'll see the political climate is made up of retirees who just want to be left in peace. As such they won't want to swallow the austerity measures necessary. Just look at the Yarmouth ferry for example. People there had the gal to fight for an obviously economically inefficient proposition. Yet, they're happy to watch our tax dollars burn. This kind of attitude will be the death of the Maritimes and it doesn't look to be changing. People happy to stay where they are while they expect others to pay for it.  Young people like myself are jumping ship. It's clear wages and the quality of living in Nova Scotia will not be increasing anytime soon. So why stay? There's obviously no political capital to see change. The Ivany report is how old now? Have we seen anything to address these issues, not that i'm aware of. Hell, our last election was happily fought over Nova Scotia Power rates. Seriously, power rates were the major issue!  /rant"
NovaScotia,2zt2il,RangerNS,5,Sat Mar 21 18:58:45 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, NS is the only province with TWO minimum wages. That is, we have a posted minimum wage of $10.40 right now. But also a ""training wage"" of $0.50 BELOW the ""minimum"" wage for the first 90 days of employment. This essentially gives low-skill employers incentive to get rid of workers before three months is up, so they can keep their wages low. It's completely backward to the idea that an employer might want to retain those workers once they have invested time in training them.   And I think there is a systemic view that is a bit like this in the province towards workers and our youth.   When you look at the rest of NS labour law, we have some of the weakest. You want to qualify for overtime (time x1.5) to earn some money? In NS you don't get time and a half until more than 48 hours are work in a week. In Alberta? Anything more than 8 hours in the day, or 44 hours in the week. In Saskatchewan? 40 hours.  NS doesn't compete to retain workers. There is incentive to bring workers in; and so it loses them.   I'll be gone before summer arrives."
NovaScotia,2zt2il,iwasnotarobot,5,Sat Mar 21 19:45:44 2015 UTC,"We are not unique in having a training wage I don't know any actual employer ever paying the training wage, and especially have never heard of anyone getting fired, just because, after 90 days."

NovaScotia,2zt2il,iwasnotarobot,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:18:55 2015 UTC,"No, the gov't can't will an industry into existence, and I'm sorry if I misinterpreted your comments about minimum wage.  But the gov't can make it easier for certain businesses to exist here, just like Ireland did in the 1990s with high tech companies, for example.  It's incredibly disheartening when you see things happening like the NDP provincial gov't giving away hundreds of millions to Irving to ""create jobs"" that apparently don't exist yet and quite possibly never will.  If they had devoted that kind of investment to creating IT training and infrastructure things would already be different in this province.  I say that because I see NS as being potentially a fantastic place for ""soft"" industry like software and internet-based companies to exist.  Companies would love to move here, with our relatively low cost of living, beautiful beaches, etc.   Once a few of them existed here, there would be a critical mass, and more would just starting showing up.  And our young people would have a new industry to look into, rather than having to move away.  All this stuff requires serious vision, drive, investment, and energy.  This is why I feel like the labour laws are a total waste of time.  This is big stuff I'm talking about, but big changes are what's needed."
NovaScotia,2zt2il,iwasnotarobot,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:26:24 2015 UTC,"All this stuff requires serious vision, drive, investment, and energy.   I absolutely agree. However, ignoring the 'nickel and dime' small-potato solutions, and going after the big, quick fixes, like giving away hundreds of millions to ""create jobs"" is what we've done in the past, and every time those quick fixes fade away as quickly as they began.  NS has a problem in generating tax revenue. To balance the books, we end up with some of the highest tax rates in the country. I would argue that a better solution is increasing the tax base. More tax payers means more tax revenue. And if you can increase the money earned by those tax payers, you not only get to increase the taxes paid, but also the circulation of money in the local economy, which could increase stability of local jobs, and maybe create a few along the way.  Qualities like serious vision, drive, and energy are not born into people overnight. They grow. And people with drive and good ideas are the kinds of people who start businesses, and small businesses are the leading non-governmental employers in the province. We need entrepreneurial people here. We need hard workers.  One of the problems in the province is that the young people with serious drive will see early on that if they're willing to work 48 hours a week at a job, Saskatchewan will pay time X 1.5 for the last 8 hours where NS will not. That's like an extra 4 hours pay per week. An equivalent to 16 hours of extra pay per month. That adds up to, even at minimum wage, an extra $2000/year. Nickels and dimes to a province's GDP, but that's a big deal to a young kid trying to save for university or their first car.  Nickels and dimes add up.  NS can't will thriving industry into existence, but the government can, with the stroke of a pen update the labour laws to be at least on-par with other provinces. If we're smart, we can go further and make the province actually look favorable.  I'm not saying that fixing the small stuff will fix everything. But I do believe that if a small step in the right direction gets you closer to your goal, it is foolish to ignore.   And maybe a few small steps can help get to better footing for making the big changes that will still surely be needed."

When future rates are set based on [the best economic crystal-balling that can be had] and then end up being wrong, the next year, NS Power is penalized by not getting rate increases. This does actually happen.  Our problems today, the mandate of URB and NSP being (a high, I grant) fixed profit margin, are based on the historical (Buchanan era) policies of keeping coal miners in employment, and rates low, (on paper) regardless of the short term affect on tax payers (taxes subsidized power loses), or long term affect on rate payers (once privatized).

Like op said will they come back at a later time and say that he is innocent or will he forever be labeled as a pedophile? Again where is the rcmp's due diligence? Where is the investigation? Is investigating a crime now simply putting an alleged perpetrators picture on tv? I think it's a dangerous precedent to set. What if the girl was simply pissed off at something he asks her to do and this is simple revenge. Maybe like many self entitled 17yo's she was made because she had to comply with something she didn't want to do.

If they had two or three victims why didn't they state that.   Now let's assume that he is found innocent. Does anyone in his circle of friends or coworkers look at him differently?

So if no one comes forward and this poor girl just made a poor judgement call because of some other reason....is this guy really ever going to be innocent again? Will the RCMP go on the news and say we made a huge mistake and this person is 100% completely innocent? Will it ever matter again? Don't get me wrong if this guy is a child molester, ill be the first to line up to cut his nuts off, but this is a horrible precedent to set. Is this how they conduct investigations now?

Unless the federal government is prepared to give us the money, we should not be forced to provide free health care.  EDIT: Apparently, Nova Scotia isn't forced to provide free health care.

We need to get more than the other provinces.   We already do. I even posted a link to show you.   Lowering taxes encourages taxpayers not to leave to other provinces where taxes are lower.   I don't follow how you lower taxes AND have healthcare. Not getting healthcare is a sure fire way to drive people out of the province because then business has to pay for employees making it cost them more.    We get the same health transfers per person as everyone else, but we have more old people.   And then we get a huge amount of equalization payments which are for and I quote here  to create ""reasonably comparable levels"" across all provinces in Health, Education, and Welfare.

It will mostly come into play with small game hunters such as myself as well as bear, migratory bird, and moose hunters.   Personally, I would love to see hunting opened on Sundays year round. I love to throw the snowshoes on and go looking for hare. I'm a student though and like most employed people and students, only get home after dark during the winter months. This leaves only Saturday to hunt. It can be a nuisance when the weather prevents you from going out on Saturday, then Sunday rolls around and it is beautiful out but you can't hunt due to an antiquated law.

I feel that one day a week where the woods are open to the enjoyment of all is not unreasonable, but I don't see why that day has to be Sunday, it is just tradition that makes it so.

Truro has a large seniors population, and as they pass, the surplus in housing that occurs will drive prices down. So housing is affordable here.  Truro has all the basics you need in terms of a town.  It's roughly a 50 minute drive to get to Halifax/Dartmouth which has everything a large city has. If you have any medical specialist needs, this is where they'll be at.  Truro is a hub town, all the major highways intersect the town, so it's easy to get around the entire province from there.

He's my advice, though...Unless you NEED or really WANT to live on the south shore (Bridgewater, Lunenburg), then don't.  The 103 is a shitty drive.  The 102 offers consistently the best drive year round.  It's twinned the whole way, and has good plowing in the winter.

I'd steer away from Amherst if you're going to Halifax every day...that's 2 hours, and you don't want to drive that section of Highway 104 in the winter on any consistent basis.  But if you can get work in Moncton, Amherst is a good option.  I'd suggest checking out viewpoint.ca for realestate searching...has a great mapping tool to show all currently available and recently sold properties in Nova Scotia.  They also have agents, or you can use someone else of your choosing.  On more plug for the Truro area (Truro, Bible Hill, Valley, Brookfield, Onslow) is if you like to travel, you're an hour or more closer to most every other destination compared to Bridgewater."
NovaScotia,2xk7g0,JDGumby,3,Sun Mar 1 14:08:59 2015 UTC,"Let me get this straight. Digby has a Ferry that bring more people every year then Yarmouth, Pictou has a Ferry that brings in as many people a year as Yarmouth. Yet those two are closed down but the Yarmouth one stays open. It also just happens that the Minster in Charge of these closings Zach Churchill is the MLA for Yarmouth? You connect the dots on this one."
NovaScotia,2xk7g0,quillghostwriter,3,Sun Mar 1 14:46:56 2015 UTC,"Digby's ferry not only brings in more people, it actually makes money. I can't comment about Pictou because I don't know about them.  The visitor center in Digby is right off of the ferry so no one who comes or goes doesn't at least see it, and it's only open for part of the year anyway during the high season if I recall.

NovaScotia,2xdgb1,JDGumby,14,Fri Feb 27 17:52:02 2015 UTC,Excellent. With all of the money being spent on the ferry it only makes sense to cut funding for activities once tourists get to Nova Scotia.

NovaScotia,2xdgb1,quillghostwriter,6,Fri Feb 27 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"So they'll spend millions on the Yarmouth Ferry, but cut spending on something that's actually useful to Nova Scotians and good for the province. Wonderful.  I also don't see how closing the info centre in Digby makes any sense. The info centre is on the main road just the off NB Ferry (a ferry that gasp...makes money!). A lot of people come through there in the summer, and it's closed all winter anyway."
NovaScotia,2xdgb1,compaqxp,3,Sat Feb 28 07:56:20 2015 UTC,"Notice that these jobs are about as far away from the levers of power as possible?   Why not cut a hundred or more from the communications department working for the Premier? I bet those jobs serve fewer people while paying far more.  On a somewhat separate note I would like to point out that if NS keeps racking up debt that we will be in for a serious debt downgrade. This means that our debt financing costs will go way up. Seeing that the debt is always rolling over eventually all the debt would then have to be serviced for the higher interest rates coming from a debt downgrade. This would make the province's financial situation way worse which would lead to at least one more round of debt downgrades, which ...  NS is approaching (or may have already reached) a point where it will simple corrode into financial rust.  The percentage of old people is going way up which places more and more demands on the youth who are effectively going on strike by moving away. New businesses aren't coming (unless lured by a tax break) and many businesses are either moving away or closing. Then to top it off the government seems hell bent on protecting a very narrow few such as a few public sector unions.  Then we get things like the ban on fracking. Fracking might or might not suck but it produces jobs and money. Having an entire province slip into a state of squalor and suffering for so little gain strikes me as insane."

The number one concern for everyone around here nowadays is the economy and it the maritimes its distinctly lacklustre. good jobs are hard to come by though they do exist. It really depends on where you live, who you know and what you can do. If you have a trade for example you'd be much better off.   There's plenty of places to live fortunately and the cost if living isnt outrageous, but this again depends on where you live. for a bit of perspective Scotland has 5,327,700 people in 78,387 km2 where as Nova Scotia has 921,727 people in 55,283 km2, 400 000 of which live in one city: Halifax. Nova Scotia is a lot more sparse than you're probably used to with only a few ""cities"" tho metropolitan centres they are not.  The number one reason most people stay or more here though is the attitude and lifestyle really. You'll always here how friendly and generous people in the Maritimes are, people are very family focused, and small towns are very close knit. Though this is of course just a generalization, there are a few crazies. I'd have no worries about meeting people and having new experiences.   So in summary: Good luck on finding a job but i'll hold the door open and offer you a beer regardless. Also bring snow gear."

NovaScotia,2x6py7,HornedRimmedGlasses,1 point,Thu Feb 26 05:00:02 2015 UTC,Halifax (and its may suburbs) is about the only place to look unless you're looking for farmhand work. Its smack middle of the province too if youre looking to go explore anywhere else in the province.  If you do end up deciding on Halifax just ask around for what part of town you should live in. they range greatly in accessibility and price. Halifax itself is a peninsula with two bridges and only a few ways off. plus HRM itself is huge. From edge to edge It can take something like 4 or 5 hours to drive tho the average commute is more like 30- 40 mins if you live outside of the city. We also have Canada's worst transit system and roads.
NovaScotia,2x6py7,HornedRimmedGlasses,10,Thu Feb 26 06:31:33 2015 UTC,There's no way driving across the HRM takes 4-5 hours. You can drive to Sydney in that kind of time frame.

It's easier if you have a degree, but you shouldn't have much difficulty getting a work visa.   Is finding a job/flat terribly difficult?   You will have a difficult time outside of Halifax / Dartmouth, so I suggest sticking to the city, at least for the first few months. As for jobs, it depends on your qualifications and what you're looking for. There are plenty of apartments in Halifax, so it's pretty easy to find one. As with any place, try to avoid the absolute bottom of the barrel if you can.   And lastly are there many social opportunites in Nova Scotia as I'd really like to meet some fantastic new people/Canadians!   Halifax has a pretty good social scene, especially in Summer.

Getting (non-seasonal) work permits in Canada without a degree requires some pretty heavy investment. Invest $250,000 in a business and they they will consider letting you come over.

And it was therapeutic to connect with others who were feeling the same way, though that was difficult because the internet was in its infancy. And it was also somewhat comforting to revel in darker music, books, and films.  But I feel like with the advances of the internet, things that were considered dark in the 80s/90s are now fairly tame, and people are going to extra lengths to be ""edgy"" and shocking.  And that leads us to these kids worshipping mass murderers. Think about that for a second. People who publicly and openly worshipped Ted Bundy or John Wayne Gacy didn't find many supporters. Now you can start a Tumblr blog and have thousands of people eat up all the insane, racist, deranged shit you post. And at that point, I don't think it's therapeutic, it's feeding an ego.

My recently purchased Honda Civic had brand new ""mud and snow"" type all seasons.  They got me around, but it was sloppy as hell.  Had they been worn at all I would have been walking.

NovaScotia,2vq143,fightthepowersthatb,10,Fri Feb 13 02:27:04 2015 UTC,"The math here is very simple:    NS is filled with baby boomers.  The boomers have finished with their kids (exiting university or older). A huge number of youth have fled west.  The government has a massive number of workers many of who are boomers about to retire. People of boomer age vote. Youth do not vote anywhere near as much Boomers have time for things like politics. Boomers have done things like paid off their mortgages so have money for things like political donations.   So any self preserving politician is going to completely cater to the boomers and their needs.   They don't need elementary schools, they don't need day cares, they don't need playgrounds, they don't want progressive taxes, they don't want retirement income taxed, they don't want the internet much, etc.  But what they want are things like frozen property taxes. They want cheap retirement homes. They want free things for seniors like free bus rides. They want lower speed limits. They want their investments protected. They want medical care that is 4 star.  So my prediction is that from this point on that every social friendly program the government does will cater to boomers and punish the youth.  My next prediction is that the youth are effectively going to go on strike by the best and the brightest just moving away. But being youth they will start families where they go and those families won't want to come back here.  Even though Alberta is going through a rough patch I suspect that we aren't going to see a whole lot of Maritimers coming back if they started families in Alberta who are now old enough to think of themselves as Albertans.   Then there are all kinds of subtle things like the fact that even if the government plays hardball with any given union they will never touch things like seniority.  But the one that I most dread is when the various pension funds start to falter and run out of money and the government will just step in and make them whole."
NovaScotia,2vq143,LessonStudio,4,Fri Feb 13 04:51:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with your point that the provincial government will, for the foreseeable future, be beholden to the boomers. I just want to point out that unions having seniority in no way hurts young people. Rather, it sets a precedent of fairer working conditions for young people who are able to find work."
NovaScotia,2vq143,super_anonymous,2,Fri Feb 13 13:53:14 2015 UTC,Seconded!
NovaScotia,2vq143,6matguy6,-1,Fri Feb 13 21:41:16 2015 UTC,"While those are problems, they aren't at all related to seniority.   Diminished bargaining power--a result of the broad shift to neoliberalism--has meant that it's harder for unions to maintain high employment standards, like better pensions.  So, the things you're upset about are from unions being too weak, not too strong.    I would agree, however, that members'/negotiators' priorities have been more about self-preservation than anything else, which is certainly a problem, but not entirely their fault."
NovaScotia,2vq143,super_anonymous,1 point,Sat Feb 14 02:13:01 2015 UTC,"Sure, some people who might otherwise not keep their jobs are kept afloat by virtue of their union membership.  However, The few instances where job security has negative consequences do not come close to matching the overwhelmingly positive effects that it has.  I would much rather join a workforce where job security, not precarity, is the norm.  Also, noone is immune to discipline, including termination.  If an employer cannot get rid of an employee it is much more often the result of lazy management than overzealous union representation.  I'm not sure we're using the word ""seniority"" the same.  For clarity: seniority just means that longer-serving members are entitled to first choice of vacation, later layoff (or earlier recall), and first choice of internal promotion (provided they meet qualifications).    I've never seen a collective agreement that retired members were entitled to vote on, but if that were the case I can certainly see it being problematic for younger members."
NovaScotia,2vq143,super_anonymous,1 point,Sat Feb 14 04:52:19 2015 UTC,"Remember the screen writer's strike. That was older members demanding media rights and it basically destroyed entire shows and writing careers.  A perfect example of seniority being a disaster would be pretty much every programming job I ever worked at. I would say 90% of the programmers over 50 hadn't improved their skills in a decade or more. They were only kept around to keep working on old contracts typically on old systems.   They hated people like me who would come in being able to use technology that was still in beta where their newest technology was often with a company that no longer existed.   Needless to say my pay was often a vast multiple of theirs and my contracts were sometimes fairly juiced in ways like massive vacation or whatnot. But the simple fact was that I would produce much more value than they would.   This is not to say that there are no programmers worth anything over 50 but the key to understanding a programming career is that every few years pretty much all the valuable technologies will have played a fairly aggressive round of musical chairs.  Thus if I had been paid less than some fairly unproductive 50 year old I would have quit the next day.   I have a huge number of engineering friends and while not unionized the whole ""seniority"" thing tends to rule engineering companies with a few boomers typically ruling the roost and the fresh out of school engineers being paid peanuts and only allowed to sharpen pencils. Where this is a huge disaster is that often the truly kickass engineers leave engineering firms and go off and start other companies such as develop a product or start programming or leave engineering all together. The result is that pretty much every engineering company around my neck of the woods is borderline incompetent and largely survive by mandated government regulations and government contracts. When real engineering projects come along such as a complicated bridge or something they have to leave either the region and sometimes the country to get the talent. Then when the engineers show up they are typically no more than their 30s or maybe early 40s.   So not only do I find seniority repulsive but probably destructive. A fair union contract that was true to all its workers would set out rewards for success and penalties for failure. The same rewards for someone with 50 years in and 1 year in."
NovaScotia,2vq143,EmperorOfCanada,1 point,Sat Feb 14 20:28:07 2015 UTC,"It is management's responsibility to promote productivity and ensure profitability. The situations you've described highlight poor management, not problems with union-provided job security. An ""old boys club"" is not the same thing as seniority in a collective agreement, which actually eliminates nepotism/favouritism from social cliches. Also, seniority that exists in collective agreements cannot circumvent job-skills requirements, so if employees without important skills are taking positions that more skilled employees would perform better, that means management is being lazy (or not understanding the work being done) and failing to write appropriate requirements into job descriptions.  I agree that strong performance should be rewarded, but the solution is not to eliminate seniority and thus erode overall job security."

Exported food can't go down in price while imported food goes up. This would create an arbitrage opportunity and the exported food would just be imported back. Ideally, exports would increase because local producers would become more efficient. This would cause local consumption of local goods to increase and the price of imported goods would fall in order to compete.   In other words, focus university research in areas that can be monitarily profited from, which generally aren't those that actually benefit society, and turn over the results to private industry.   They generally are those that benefit society. Increasing the productivity of businesses is a good thing. The social benefits of fundamental research is spread more widely and we wouldn't get as much of a return on that kind of investment.   Again, divert product from the local market, forcing us to import the same goods at higher prices.   Again, the prices of imports would go down.

NovaScotia,2v73h2,seemedlikeagoodplan,6,Sun Feb 8 15:25:07 2015 UTC,This happens to me now and then.  It's handy to have a yellow diesel jerry can on hand. You can go grab $20 worth or so of diesel at the gas station to get you by.  Only prob is you're then paying road tax on it but that's ok when you're in a jam.
NovaScotia,2v73h2,HockeyDadNinja,2,Sun Feb 8 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"Save your receipts, I think you can get a rebate on the road tax part if you use diesel in your furnace.  I did a quick Google search and couldn't find it for NS quickly, but it does exist in some areas."

NovaScotia,2v73h2,jarret_g,2,Mon Feb 9 01:52:35 2015 UTC,That's terrible for your oil lines/filter. Check your gauge frequently. If your gauge isn't working then get automatic delivery every few weeks
NovaScotia,2v73h2,8v92,2,Mon Feb 9 02:31:05 2015 UTC,Diesel is a little heavier than furnace oil;  so it May gum up the injector in your furnace.  A lot of gas stations here in ns sell furnace oil

NovaScotia,2v3y62,pateras,3,Sat Feb 7 18:04:46 2015 UTC,"I n view of all that, the Nova Scotia power rebate should be done away with for the simple reason that at least 80 per cent of it subsidizes those who can pay, including the very well off. It should be dropped on condition a support system can be devised for those who can’t pay — involving Community Services or any group, such as the Salvation Army or local and church social committees, that people are apt to approach for help. Efficiency Nova Scotia should be involved, following up with fixes aimed at the low-income.  As for carbon taxes — a modest one at first for a dry run that, for political reasons, should be mostly revenue-neutral. That is, the money should be used to drop taxes on something else, as was the case in B.C., where the tax has been a success and has been held out as a model throughout the Western world. Its implementation was followed by economic growth, baffling the “jobs-killing carbon tax” mantra of the right wing.   So juggle money around in hopes of being Robin Hood.  What a long read for such a dismal proposal"
NovaScotia,2v3y62,downvote-thief,3,Sat Feb 7 18:59:38 2015 UTC,Considering the government was elected on a very specific promise to cut taxes on energy and gas this would the opposite of their whole election platform.
NovaScotia,2v3y62,quillghostwriter,3,Sun Feb 8 15:08:25 2015 UTC,"Yes.  It reads exactly opposite of their platform, and frankly seems poorly thought out at that.  Guess they are actually going to increase it for those who can 'afford it' and decrease it for the truly unfortunate, and of course the slacker/drug addict/social parasite who never held a job or paid any taxes because they continue to get better deals suckling on the government's teet. Don't get me wrong,  there are people who definitely need it.  But there are also people who abuse it."
NovaScotia,2v3y62,downvote-thief,3,Sun Feb 8 15:20:47 2015 UTC,A revenue neutral tax is something I would talk about. Problem is the government is looking to this tax to fill a. 300 million dollar hole and said as much at the fiscal fourm  I went to.   The other issue the Liberals promised not add the HST back on home energy McNeil even passed a bill he wrote in 2012 on it. They have a mandate to reduce energy prices not make them higher.
NovaScotia,2v3y62,quillghostwriter,3,Sun Feb 8 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"A carbon tax is a very bad idea for Nova Scotia.

The last time the interrupter clause was invoked by the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board was in October 2012, and resulted in a reduction of 5.3 cents per litre.   So let me get this straight, In the last 6 or so months, gas had dropped from $1.39 to $0.91, often 5 or 6 cents at a time, and not once did the UARB think this was worth using the interrupter clause. Now that gas has starting to go back up, they drop everything to raise it 2 days early."

I'll throw out the guess that there will be another $3 million in hidden costs that hopefully the auditor general will turn up.  The liberals have a number of years before their next election. They won't want this hanging over them when it comes. So I can't see them letting this go past this summer. So my next guess is that they have their fingers crossed as to this summer's numbers being way up. If they aren't then they will pull the plug hard and fast in the fall in an attempt to look ""decisive"".

NovaScotia,2szj6d,quillghostwriter,1 point,Tue Jan 20 02:16:35 2015 UTC,So it looks like NSGUE isn't going to lose one member but will be the only union which will be allowed to represent one unit. The rest will have to team up in Units which is what the unions suggested in the Summer before we spent 1 million dollars on a Bill even the government has no clue about.
NovaScotia,2szj6d,erythros,1 point,Mon Jan 19 23:09:45 2015 UTC,Why is there legislation determining the structure of unions? Shouldn't unions be organized by the people who belong to them?
NovaScotia,2szj6d,RangerNS,2,Tue Jan 20 02:18:00 2015 UTC,"People who belong to unions generally have three choices  1) Join that union, paying their dues, getting union pay and rights, and ability to vote  2) Not join the union; pay donations to some random charity exactly the same as their union dues, get union pay and rights, but zero voting rights 3) Not take that job     So, this will matter not one fucking bit for workers, but dramatically reduce the number of absurdly well paid union execs."
NovaScotia,2szj6d,erythros,2,Tue Jan 20 02:30:06 2015 UTC,"How does that answer my question? I've always thought of unions as organizations created by workers. However,   Under legislation passed in the fall, there will be four separate unions for nurses, licensed practical nurses, support staff including cleaning and cooks, clerical staff and health-care workers such as lab technologists and porters.   this seems to imply that the unions are governed by legislation.  So, the unions must have been created by the government, which doesn't seem right."
NovaScotia,2szj6d,Horatioclarkson,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:29:31 2015 UTC,"The plan is to assign each of those bargaining units to one of the existing unions (Nurses Union, Unifor, NSGEU and CUPE) for representation. Contract talks would be streamlined and hopefully cost savings would occur."
NovaScotia,2szj6d,erythros,1 point,Tue Jan 20 04:47:33 2015 UTC,"My question is why is the structure of a union, which is presumably an independent organization founded by the workers, determined by government legislation? To me, this is as strange as if I found out that some private company had a piece of legislation specifically dealing with how that company were to operate. There are some special companies in this situation, so I'm wondering if this union is a special union, and if so, why?"
NovaScotia,2szj6d,BillTheBastard,1 point,Tue Jan 20 04:52:27 2015 UTC,"The structure of the unions (from what I understand) will not be changing. The membership requirements will, though. Most workplaces have a choice of one union or no union, as /u/RangerNS said, so in that way employees of the Department of Health will have no fewer rights than anyone else in the province. Union members will still determine how their union is run."
NovaScotia,2szj6d,erythros,2,Tue Jan 20 06:44:56 2015 UTC,"OK. But what I want to know, has nothing to do with what you, /u/Horatioclarkson, or /u/RangerNS are talking about. What I want to know, is why this union is governed by legislation at all. This question is not inquiring about what is happening to the unions or the legislation. It's asking why the legislation exists in the first place. Were the unions created by the government? Are independent unions illegal in healthcare? Does this have something to do essential services? Why is the union governed by the government through legislation rather than through its members as I thought all unions were?"
NovaScotia,2szj6d,BillTheBastard,1 point,Tue Jan 20 07:33:36 2015 UTC,"The unions aren't being affected by this legislation (again: insofar as I understand) except in that their membership is.

Taxing diapers for children to benefit the rich would only put this province in a worse state than it already is, what with even hard working Nova Scotians having to decide between paying NS power, or buying food.

Let me explain something to you,  the poor  Benefit disproportionately from taxes and government spending programs.  They do so because they don't have any money to pay taxes in the first place and recieve all of the same services that someone paying 40k of their 100k salary.  Now I like that we take care of our poor, so don't get me wrong i'm not blaming them for anything.  Now for reality, we have no money, the industries that we have traditionally depended on are dieing  (forestry, mining)  and our demographics are skewing old.  This means that our corporate tax base is shrinking, and our aging population's tax base is shrinking while they are costing the province more than ever before i.e. healthcare.  The NDP recieved the same kind of news in their own report that the liberals did.  The difference is the liberals are acting on it while the NDP, just ignored it while making sure the NSGEU got their full raises.

NovaScotia,2sehb5,monofonik,2,Sun Jan 18 20:24:59 2015 UTC,"I chop up a large onion and put it in a big pot.  I add a whole chicken.  I add salt and pepper to taste, not too much cause you can always add some more later on if it isn't flavored enough.  I fill the pot with water.  I then continue and cook the chicken in the water for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  After the chicken is cooked, I take it out of the water into a dish, where I take the meat off the bones.  Discard the bones and skin.  Make sure that there is about 12 cups of broth left in the pot.  If you don't think there is, then add water, taste it and if you need to, add more salt and  pepper.  Make sure the broth is simmering the whole time.  If you're using canned chicken broth, then I'm not too sure about the flavoring.   Just taste it as you go along.  Put the grated potatoes (d'Eon's mix or whatever mix you can find - otherwise you're going to have to mash your potatoes and dry it) and in this case, only half, into a large bowl.   Add the cold water, remember only half, since you're only using half the mix.  I add two cups at a time of the broth that the chicken has cooked in, to the grated potato mix, and  I mix it with a potato masher. Take your time, there's no rush.  Mix it really well after each of the 2 cups (about 2 minutes after each addition).  It has to sort of cooks as you're doing  this.  After you have added all the broth, (I use 12 cups, but check the d'Eons recipe, it might be more or less, in any case remember to cut it in half) .   And using a bit more broth than it calls for (like a cup more) is okay.  If you use less, then your rappie pie will be hard and I don't like hard rappie pie.  After you've mixed the broth and the mix, remember to take your time, grease your roaster with butter or shortening.  Add half the rappie pie mix and then layer all your chicken over it and then add the rest of the rappie pie mix.  I dot butter on the top to get a crust.  I cook it for 2 hours at 350 degrees."

I'd highly recommend White Point if you haven't been there before. It is just far enough away that it feels like a getaway but the town of Liverpool is near enough for necessities.   The food and staff there are wonderful and there are many options for accomodations from seaside cottages with fireplaces to lodge rooms in the main lodge, etc. The view is lovely, right on the ocean and if you bundle up you can even take a walk along the beach.   There's usually entertainment in the small lounge/pub on weekends. There's also a pool and games room. There are many beaches nearby for walking if the weather is right.   They also have a spa for massages and offer different packages that include things like wine, flowers, etc.   I used to work at White Point years ago and it truly is one of Nova Scotia's gems. You won't be disappointed with a getaway there. In fact, I'm planning on taking my family back there for March Break but have also spent a lovely weekend there pre-kids and loved it."

NovaScotia,2rywuw,LessonStudio,3,Sat Jan 10 18:40:48 2015 UTC,"I suspect that they looked at the report and their jaws just dropped. Phrases went around the room like, ""Polishing a turd.""  They probably now have a full accounting of how little this brings he province for how much money. Also I am willing the report shows how one sided this whole deal is. Maine wins, NS loses. Basically none of the staff, services, fuel, or management are from NS. We are funding this 100% and Maine and a few seasonal businesses(with nearly 100% minimum wage employees) in Yarmouth are somewhat benefiting.   I suspect that this is one of these situations where just writing those who would lose a cheque would be a whole lot cheaper than pretending that this is such a good deal.  But then someone really wised everyone up when they started to realize that this is going to be over 10% of next years budget deficit. So the only spin they need to figure out at this point is how to cancel this without losing all the votes in that area and not looking like a bunch of complete morons. A perfect example is the 21 million that was supposed to be used over many many years. That is like giving a 5 year old(with a drinking problem) all the allowance in one go they are going to get until they are 15 and then being surprised when they spent it before the weekend was done.  My prediction is that we will never really see the report because it contains ""proprietary"" information. This can be read as ""Massively embarrassing."""
NovaScotia,2rywuw,LessonStudio,2,Sun Jan 11 03:29:34 2015 UTC,"A perfect example is the 21 million that was supposed to be used over many many years.    The weirdest part of this is the original deal said they could not draw on more then their yearly allotment outside of the year it was promised. The new government changed the agreement to let the company access the whole 5 years in the first year. Then they said ""the last government cut a bad deal but we changed it and now it is much better."" It isn't better they spent 5 years whole of money in a year. That was always government spin and now we know the government is worse with handouts then the last. Scary."
NovaScotia,2rywuw,LessonStudio,1 point,Sun Jan 11 15:30:14 2015 UTC,"Years ago I was told by a senior civil servant that when they dealt with elected officials that they found that none of them (except a single one now long gone) could understand what a million dollars was; let alone 10's of millions. They didn't understand that there are roughly 400,000 households in NS and that every time a million dollars was spent that it was $2 lost per NS household. So this 21 million dollars works out to over $40 per household. That a $100 million bailout was $200 per household.   This government person attributed it to the fact that few had bought anything more than a house or a car in their financial lifetime dealings. But what would then happen is that these same elected officials would squabble viciously over $50,000 or less as that was a number they could wrap their pea brains around. In some debates this would be made clear when they would do the fight over a pittance while agreeing to spend millions with pretty much a wave of the hand.  The problem is that the public doesn't understand either. So when the government gave Abitibi Bowater $50 million people don't understand that the government just reached into their pockets and stole over $100 that went straight into very very rich people's pockets. Or that the $304 million to Irving was over $600 per household.   So these nitwits just blithely wave their hand to make minor political irritations go away at massive cost to the rest of us.  So when this Younger guy gets his career ruined in a few weeks I will not shed one tear for him as I would love to see the whole lot of them resign in shame."

Well that one adds jobs and households so that is a poor example. 300 million over 20 years bringing in 11,000 jobs works out to a net gain for every tax payer in the province because there are more tax payers contributing to the pot. However the rest of your post is pretty spot on. The biggest problem with the Ferry is it only brings in 10 million in GDP. So we spend 20 million from the government to make 10 million as a province. That is some awesome government math for you."

Most people involved can't figure out why they did it. Irving was making a profit without it so they weren't bowing out. And it didn't influence the federal decision as they knew Irving could finance it no problem.  So yes if it had been needed it would have been good value for the money but at this point it would be like you or I going to Irving and saying, ""How about I pay you $1.20 per litre because you need the money to send the 5th generation of Irvings to University in better cars than those lousy BMWs."" My guess is that the Irvings did a simple calculation and thought, ""This government is desperate for a win and knows that they dare not do anything that would make it look like they screwed this up. So lets ask for an outrageous amount of money and see if the fools will do it."" This then circles back to the fact that these nitwits don't know what these amounts really are. Irving on the otherhand does."

Books aren't common as is in some areas where the schools are being updated to be Digital, not having a library is kind of sad, the amount of stories and information that young and old alike won't have access to is a shame because of the difficulty funding those sites, as well it's a place of refuge for many with difficult home lives. I knew a number of kids who used to hang out at the library all day and read or go on the few computers available at the local library because they didn't want to be home.  It's just a bit troubling that these institutions have been neglected for so long that they've become irrelevant.

NovaScotia,2rgrag,choihanam,2,Wed Jan 7 00:31:01 2015 UTC,"I am actually worried about this development. Basically in 20 years everyone will have left a trail of nasty comments that could burn pretty much anyone. Not just the somewhat public facebook comments but even texts, chats, selfie videos, and who knows what recording technology of the future.  What could happen is almost every person who starts to become public could suddenly have some tiny aspect of their past come to haunt them.  The recent Sony emails are really good that way. One executive made some comments that are mildly racial about Obama's potential movie choices. Yet that same executive defended using Denzel Washington in a movie even though he indicated that black leading men don't sell well in some foreign markets. I am pretty sure that if they guy were a dyed in the wool racist that he would not defend using a great actor (his words) even though it was going to cost money, especially where the original roll was played by a white guy.  So if we didn't have the whole picture then this might look far worse for that guy.  The other key is that people are interacting with their devices 24/7 which includes while angry, drunk, tired, etc. So we can't simply say that they should watch what they say as that is impossible.  So while it seems like these guys are douchebags, I would like to see a pattern of behaviour before condemning them. But this seems to be a monstrous example of thought police wildly out of control. I think that it would be interesting to look at the past behaviour of those calling for the heads of these kids. What stupid things have they said?"

Can you imagine what postings the greatest writers of the last 100 or so years would have been posting online? Writers such as Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde? Man o man they would have probably offended every group available. I could see someone such as Wilde making a list of those he hadn't yet offended and seeing how he could rectify that.

Tuition at this program is about 20k a year and they are all 4th years. Imagine someone taking away your house for making an off colour joke.  In my opinion that's what it boils down to. I think all the guys who joined the group are stupid idiots who should be suspended for a few weeks, and take a sensitivity training course.  If an investigation finds that any of them ever drugged a woman and had sex with them while unconscious, they should be expelled, charged with rape and jailed for the maximum sentence.   We have laws against violence and rape. We don't need to start giving government or educational facilities the right to fucking comb through our social media just in case something nasty is said.   I do think the names of the men should be released though. Make sure the public has the right to deny any patronage to immature dicks and make women feel safer about staying away from any guy that would joke about such things."

NovaScotia,2rgrag,Bombadildo1,1 point,Wed Jan 7 00:26:36 2015 UTC,"They are not professors they are students. There is an insanely huge difference in positions. Professors who exhibit this type of attitude can pass it on to students which is why they are treated with a bit more gravitas. But I do think that people shout ""Fire the asshole"" a bit too much.   Ever been fired? It truly can fuck with your life. I understand actions and consequences but in my mind words are words and should be treated a lot less seriously than actions.  If any of these fuckers ever raped a woman I'd be first in line to lobby to increase the penalty for rape to castration and I would help you cut off their balls personally.  Rape is a heinous crime that is seriously under punished in all countries. I am for increasing the statute of limitations for this crime to make it not expire as is the case for murder. I am for very barbaric punishments like castration, chemical or physical. But I am solidly against people's lives being screwed for careless speech."

Beautiful trails and beaches, plus a provincial park. 30km from Antigonish Boyd's Seafood Galley for ocean to table seafood. I mean you could actually throw your food BACK into the water. Great view as well and no one minds if you want to walk on the boardwalks and view some boats. 20 km from Antigonish You'll find the most beer on tap at The Split Crow. But you CAN'T skip out on The Townhouse. Locally grown food is in almost every item on the menu and the owner brews small batches of beer upstairs. DON'T MISS OUT they usually have jazz and folk artists weekly. ""Downtown"" Antigonish... you'll understand the quotes when you see it. Try ""The Wheel"" Pizza. You've likely had nothing else like it. Also in Antigonish FUN FACT: In Nova Scotia it is impossible to be more than 56km from the ocean.

NovaScotia,2qxi09,Leovinus_Jones,2,Sat Jan 3 00:16:29 2015 UTC,"Oh man. So pumped to help you! I lived in Antigonish for four years, until last year and have some great spots to recommend you:  Beaches:  Antigonish is a short drive from some incredible beaches. Ranked in order of awesomeness:   I don't remember the name, but the parking area for it is here: 45.683568, -61.870939 Incredible long beach that almost seals the harbour. You can walk East or West for kilometers, and I often had the whole place to myself. A word of caution - walking East will take you under a bluff which has been rapidly eroded by the sea. Be careful when passing under/by it. Big Island - a bit of a drive from town, but a beautiful one that is worth as much as the beach itself. It is located here: 45.675485, -62.375876  There are multiple spots to park and get out, so I encourage you to drive all the way on to the island for a sightsee before picking which part of the massive beach you want to start on.  Don't be surprised to see interesting things on the beach. Once I found a massive dead Tuna the size of a car. Another time, the whole beach was littered with logs carried in from a cargo ship that lost its load. Jimtown Beach. Very close to town and a pretty drive. Adjacent to another beach (see 4.) which is a good backup if this one is too busy. It is located here: 45.711559, -61.899745 a little up the road from... Mahoney's Beach. This is a nice spot, and quite long so you can walk to the South a bit. But I always found it to be the busiest. Still worth a visit. It is located here: 45.705208, -61.900482 Note that if the tide is right, you can actually ford the channel between beaches 1 and 4! Likewise at beach 3, if the tide is low, you can walk North and connect to an otherwise private beach (usually only accessible from several private properties. I never had a problem walking there, and there are beautiful pink saltstones there. HOWEVER: Use caution when swimming across such things as there may be unseen currents. I am not responsible should you encounter issues. Wading depth should be fine.    There are other beaches in the area but they are either further away or not as nice.  You mentioned Acadians - there is a large area of Acadians near Beach 1.  Monks' Head Road - a right turn before the beach - will lead you to the Pomquet Region, which is a lovely little farming / fishing community with its own French speaking High School. Nice for a drive through. WHich has just reminded me of:  Beach 5!! Pomquet Beach. Which Should really be beach 3 in terms of goodness. It is located here: 45.648637, -61.814199 and is a must-see.  Otherwise, walk the Landing, just off the main street of Antigonish. This is a small conserved walkway that follows the 'harbour' and is usually gorgeous in the summer. I usually see wildlife, so watch for Bald Eagles, muskrats, turtles and often sea birds. It is located here: 45.625270, -61.976519  Drive the Sunrise Trail North to go around Cape George and see the lighthouse. 45.884043, -61.922117 making a loop out to Beach 1 makes for a nice day.  More will come to me, and I'll edit this post. I'd skip New Glasgow. It's not a very appealing place, likewise Port Hawkesbury. They are both industrial downs well past their hey-days. Nice people, for sure, but not exactly tourist attractions.  Cape Breton you must see, given your proximity, but I'll let Capers better describe their beautiful island home.   It's worth your while to visit the gorgeous town of Guysborough. Take the scenic route which has you pass through Saint Andrews (another beautiful town). Along the way, if you're the type who likes such things, there is apparently [an abandoned and haunted farmstead]. (http://www.paranormalsoup.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=27112) Never found it myself, but got pretty creeped out looking a few times.  Otherwise I'd say get out and explore the area. There's Beaver Mountain Provincial Park, and the nearby Ski Hill, though it was decommissioned when I lived there. That said it was full of great trails open to the public. Great for summer hiking.  In town if you can catch a theatre performance at the Bauer theatre. Usually pretty good. Gabrieau's food is the best in town, but still not perhaps as good as its prices would have you believe. Still, it's not bad, and swanky for a small town. Pizza wise everyone says the Wheel but I've always thought it was meh. Snappy Tomato Pizza does better food, but they aren't the landmark the Wheel is.  Antigonish is a beautiful town in a beautiful area. I lived there for years and felt like there was still so much more to discover. No doubt you'll have a great time. If I can recall anything else I will add it on, and if I can answer any questions you may have I will do my utmost."

It's one of the most historically significant towns in Canada as it was one of the very first settled areas in North America.  They've kept the history in the form of museums, the fort, heritage houses and historic buildings EVERYWHERE, and just an overall feeling of history in the entire town.    It's on the water and has lovely walking trails and parks everywhere and although the town is small, it is a tourist's dream with fun shops and a huge busy farmer's market on Saturdays.  It's close to Kejimkujik Park if you want to hike or camp, but there are tons of smaller parks, trails, and pretty natural areas in pretty much all directions.  Oh, and Upper Clements Park (theme park with roller coasters, water rides, and one of those tree adventure places) is down the road if you go during the summer.    The town is overflowing with huge heritage mansions that are now bed and breakfasts.

I went there on a date last fall and it was lovely. I'm sure you guys would love it. I would recommend going when the weather is warm, however. You have to go down a very steep hill to get to the falls, and it would not be safe at all in the winter."

The union could be intelligent and work with their employers to make them competitive, by getting their members to work harder/faster or taking a pay cut to compete.

News of Nova Scotia's $9 million payout only emerged Thursday when the Province released its third quarter fiscal update.   Another case of throwing good money after bad. It's a dying industry that is A) out of vogue and B) facing fierce competition from overseas where the laws are more lax and cost of production much lower.  Why do we keep trying to prop up these ""traditional"" industries? Why not let the free market speak. It's 96 farms in a province with huge unemployment issues. Invest that money in future growth. I mean, even if it can't be used to jump start a new industry (although I'm sure it could be) put it into education. Putting more money into schools is never a bad investment."

NovaScotia,2p3huv,manchap,3,Sat Dec 13 20:57:18 2014 UTC,Yes however you aren't factoring in efficiency which ups your costs. Why no compare all costs?
NovaScotia,2p3huv,manchap,-1,Sat Dec 13 22:42:15 2014 UTC,"Efficiency of what? Baseboard electric heaters, for example, are 100% efficient at converting electric energy in to thermal energy because they are just a simple resistance. The same with your oven/stove,  hot water heater,  etc."
NovaScotia,2p3huv,RandomCDN,2,Sun Dec 14 14:48:39 2014 UTC,No you pay an efficiency charge which is not calculated in the rate but which is added on top of your bill. This charge is based on the electricity you use so it adds to the cost of the electricity. While you pay 15 cents/kwh you must also include the efficiency charge you pay if you want to calculate total cost. It is pointless to compare to other places unless we compare what you actually pay base rate+other charges. Which is why I posted the table and didn't go by your bill.

NovaScotia,2oxocb,JDGumby,4,Thu Dec 11 03:11:31 2014 UTC,Can someone explain to me why the province thinks it deserves the insurance money?
NovaScotia,2oxocb,kinkakinka,1 point,Thu Dec 11 22:21:50 2014 UTC,I believe it has to do with the major costs of covering the healthcare of the victim of the crash. Since a large portion of the insurance is to cover medical expenses and the province is paying for the majority of the healthcare expenses they feel that they should recoup some of those expenses.  I don't agree with their reasoning personally but I believe that is the tack that they will take in any court cases.
NovaScotia,2oxocb,Wavemanns,3,Fri Dec 12 05:28:48 2014 UTC,"Ok, I was wondering if that was the case or not. I wonder if there is president for this.

NovaScotia,2o4fpy,kinkakinka,5,Wed Dec 3 12:43:23 2014 UTC,"I was a teacher for a brief time before I decided to move on to a different career. What I saw while I was in local schools is that the classroom teacher is expected to take on the burden of IPPs and special instruction for the majority of students. Only those with major difficulties have things like EPAs (educational program assistants), and each school usually only has one ""Learning Centre"" teacher. Students who are close to the average will visit the Learning Centre a couple of times a week for a bit of one-on-one instruction, but otherwise spend much of their time in the regular classroom with regular students. For a lot of students with difficulties this works, because their difficulties are minor. However, there are some students, for one reason or another, who struggle greatly, and many of them don't get the supports they need because they just aren't available. One teacher in a class with 30 or so students does NOT have time to give individual attention to every student, and some will fall through the cracks. As far as I am concerned, there should be way way wayyyy more teachers, whether it becomes a ""team"" of teachers in one room with 30 students, or less students per class, or even streaming classes, if that's what's necessary (streaming is where you put high achievers in one class, medium achievers in another class, and students with special needs in another class, it is something that has fallen out of style in the past few years). I am pro-streaming to a degree because it is well proven that streaming ONLY works when the teacher has adequate prep time for every student's IEP and enough time to deal with students who need the extra attention, and while the students who require the extra attention usually do benefit from a streamed class, students who are high achievers usually suffer in this situation. I'd actually like to see a combination of streaming and combined classes based on each student's needs, but there's no way the school boards would ever fund that."
NovaScotia,2o4fpy,kinkakinka,1 point,Thu Dec 4 01:23:42 2014 UTC,"The classroom teacher is expected to take on the burden of IPPs    Although I was aware of several students who visited resource a few times a week, I did not realize that their regular teacher would be required to support their IPP.

I'd actually like to see a combination of streaming and combined classes based on each student's needs, but there's no way the school boards would ever fund that.   Based on what you said at the top it sounds like that is what they're trying to do; without having enough teachers.

Fires, diseases, insects; they are all a part of the succession of species and regimes that occurs in nature.  When you take forests and manage them primarily for timber output - and in so doing try to limit or remove these disturbances - you are just asking for trouble. They build up to the point where they become epic or epidemic.   This is an unfortunate but inevitable side effect of our past forestry practices. Things are getting better in modernity, but only because the writing was on the wall for so long - and adopted too late. Now we just have to weather these things, do our best to continue to mitigate them, and hopefully change our practices to be more flexible in allowing nature to continue its assorted cycles."

Why is Edmonton's crime rate so much worse than Calgary, when income is comparable? A small sample size for sure--and not saying that income won't have a bearing on violent crime--but income doesn't appear to correlate enough here to be a significant factor. What else could it be?"

It would probably take about a year or two for people to get used to the prices, and it wouldn't be hard to bring in the new system in phases. If the people demand it, they may be able to get the government to act, but there will be significant pushback from businesses, especially in communities on the border with New Brunswick, until the implement the same system."

We convert it manually as it is.. It'd be easier as a consumer to see it broken down on the receipt post sale then to manually convert it trying to determine if it really is a good deal or not.  Plus, as a consumer, if something is 19.99 and I can pay with a 20$ and not hunt in my pockets for a loonie and a twoonie.  It's been a while since I've been in the liquor store in Nova Scotia.

I moved here from a country that always includes the tax in the list price, but gives the breakdown of tax paid on the receipt.   Granted, online retailers might find implementation a little more complicated. This might require companies to develop a drop-down list of provinces on their website to adjust the displayed prices.   Even if tax-included pricing isn't implemented for online shopping it doesn't mean it couldn't and shouldn't be done for bricks-and-mortar stores.  Edit: fixed the grammar."

That 19 means ""less than 20"" to us and that sounds like a good deal, even if we know deep down that it's not. When we take that item up to the register and it clocks in at $22.98 ($23!), we're now paying $4 more than we originally expected. And we pay it.  What really fucking pissed me off when I was a kid was when KFC introduced the Toonie Tuesdays.

I'm going to go ahead and assume you have a vehicle. If not, get one. You'll need it. We live right in town so everything is in walking distance, but a vehicle is necessary for grocery runs and exploring the rest of the area.   For housing, if you're going to rent and you want to be in town, I was told to avoid the South End, which is below Forrest Street. If you're looking into surrounding areas, be sure to Google Map everything you're looking for. Something that looks ""not far"" can be an hour's drive away.   If you're looking to buy a house, I recommend Lakeside Realty. They're awesome there.   Do you have kids? You mention you're from Montreal. You might want to look into schools that have immersion programs down here. From what I overheard, not all of the elementary schools have French programs. I also don't know about all-French schools in this town, but I grew up in an Acadian area nearby. Check out the CSAP - the Acadian school board. They'll have better information on that than I do.  We don't have a lot in the way of shopping, but New Minas (in the Annapolis Valley) and Bridgewater (on the South Shore) offer a bit more options at roughly an hour and a half away and Halifax is only 3 hours away.   Yarmouth is very much a seaside town. Not only because yes, it lies on the ocean, but because of the way of life down here. Everything is slow and relaxed. People are actually friendly and talk to you. Now, it may be because they want to later talk about you ... but hey, small towns.   The population down here is a bit on the older side, so there is zero nightlife. There are a couple of pubs that I've noticed and I have seen a couple of bars, but the town again, is very quiet, especially on weekends.   When it comes time to get internet/phone/TV, the options are Eastlink and Bell. Depending on the area where you're looking to move, one may be available while the other won't be. Also, if you live far enough away from town, your options for internet start to ... um ... suck. In town, you can get FibreOP. When we were looking at houses, there were areas where highspeed wasn't available.   You're going to have fun adjusting to small town living, but you'll get used to it."

Most bigger events take place in Halifax, but there are exceptions like the Apple Blossom Festival.  Near Yarmouth you've got two larger sand beaches: Mavillette Beach, and Port Maitland Beach. Both are quite large beaches, and at low tide can stretch for over 100 meters from the high water mark to the surf. I don't know what their water temperatures are normally in the summer but I have seen it range between 12-18 for Mavillette.  Its 3 to 3.5 hours, on a clear day, to get to Halifax if you are up for weekend trips.  If you want good lobster there are few other places in existence than Nova Scotia. Yarmouth and the surrounding areas are primarily fishing communities. Most restaurants and markets should have fresh local lobster, as well as other seafood.  The area is primarily Acadian. Acadian French is different from Quebec French. Some Acadians may not even be able to understand Quebec French.

NovaScotia,2ms01b,C0lMustard,3,Wed Nov 19 22:27:27 2014 UTC,"This is where the various provinces really need to cooperate.   But my theory is that the province is actually chasing everybody out. High power rates, terrible healthcare, high taxes, sclerotic bureaucracy, extreme patronage politics, useless schools at all levels, expensive universities, terrible infrastructure, red tape nightmares, layer upon layer of taxes, strange property development, abuse of rural voters, ever increasing government debt, abuse of urban voters, plus so much more.     I think that it is best summed up that we threw all three parties out in the last decade or so. It is telling that the system itself is broken when each of the three parties acts nearly identically to each other.   Basically the plan goes, make promises, get elected, hire Toronto based consultants who will say something (doesn't matter what), give jobs to some party supporters, hand money to party supporters in business, talk about the budget being tough, talk about high hopes for offshore oil, talk tough with companies like NSP, cave in to companies like NSP, hand tax breaks to companies that don't need it, rearrange the titanic, deck chairs in the next budget, cut some budgetary item that somehow will actually cost taxpayers more in the end, have a scandal, realize that the election is coming so spend money like a drunken sailor but make even grander promises, and finally get thrown out of office.   But in the above mess what I left out is that in an attempt to actually govern they will only over react to the crisis of the day. So after spending a year not giving any support to a region they will throw $100 million at some dying industry that is closing in that region. After talking tough to some strikers they will give in to all their demands. And with some things like the ferry they will flounder which not only gets nothing done but actually ends up sabotaging the project that they are floundering about.   Oh and I missed out on the phase where they take the scandal ridden patronage organizations like NSBI and either rename them or make some minor change that actually makes them more patronage friendly instead of less, but in the name of being anti-patronage.  One of my favourite examples is that I know someone who just got into NSCC in some highly desired program. Basically he end run some zillion year waiting list that will give him the training for a kick ass income. But instead of doubling up on highly desired programs such as that one they have things like music training and a zillion other programs where people will earn about zero when done. I would think that a multi year waiting list would be a giant signal that the program is desired. It shows to me that even things like NSCC which is supposed to be very practical is just another lumbering part of the sclerotic bureaucracy."

Having a higher minimum wage and lowering the bottom two tax brackets. The LOWER CLASSES need the tax help and also spend the money to grow the economy.   Take the top tax bracket and find out at what point it actually causes outmigration (IE. at $220,000 a year people start to move), and then add 3-4 more tax brackets of a lesser rate. ( for example, 21% of 220,000, then 5% of the next 100,000, 8% of the next 100,000, 5% of the next 150,000). That way you can entice well of people to move here.

This would ensure a stable fish population at the size which maximizes the yield of the fishing industry. The two drawbacks would be the cost of enforcement of the tax and measuring fish birthrates.  The other option which would avoid the cost of measuring birthrates would be to estimate the theoretical fish population level that maximizes birthrates and then to target that population level with PID controller. This is based on the assumption that the fish population is easier to measure than the fish birthrate.  Finally, if frequent population estimation is too expensive, there should at least be a flat tax that errs on the side of being too high."

Their taxes don't come close to covering the services that are provided. The housing prices are already low there so not much is coming from property taxes (and what does the municipality provide? Certainly not much to do with the ferry). And many residents are retired, seasonal or under employed, so not a lot of income tax coming from the island.   Of course I think that some money here and there to support it is fine. But we could be talking tens of millions of dollars and that changes the conversation completely."
NovaScotia,2mnjua,fadetowhite,4,Tue Nov 18 14:20:43 2014 UTC,"For the sake of argument, the days of the ""Government Wharf"" ended years ago in most of Nova Scotia. Should the province really be responsible for providing a year-round wharf for a couple of fishermen, or should they cover the costs themselves?  A more user-pay situation would certainly result in higher ferry fares, but again, should the entire province be subsidising a small number of mostly holiday homes?"

That solves the residential transportation problem.   For the local fishers:  A) Park fishing boats at Big Tancook Island (or on a mooring point, 10m off shore) B) Buy zodiac C) Use zodiac to get to fishing boat D) Use fishing boat to get to a place that sells bait, diesel, etc. (THE SAME PLACE THAT BUYS YOUR LOBSTER)"

Secondly, its being built on top of a unique protected eco system for no apparent reason.    This is the first i'm hearing about this.  I'm not familiar with the land it's being developed on.  What's unique about the land? What if they moved it 2 miles away? Is there anything unique about all of the land on the east coast of the cabot trail?   The reason being given is its one of the closest points to europe in Canada, but that has already been disproven. Why damage an already beautiful eco system for something like this?   Relative to the rest of Canada it is a close point to Europe.  In combination with it being on the cabot trail that's why that area was chosen.  Sure, you could build it on the east coast of the avalon peninsula but as far as tourist destination goes the cabot trail is far better.

I'm in my late 30s and I've only recently reached the point where I am almost never asked for id. I have some grey hair and a non trivial beard.  The law places the burden on people who sell alcohol to ensure that the recipient is of age. Nobody wants to lose their job or get fined simply because they assumed and the authorities do send in secret shoppers to check that the rules are being followed.   Some jurisdictions are pretty lax in enforcement, I haven't purchased alcohol in NS or NB for a while but I can tell you that my experience in university was that NB was pretty lax.   They're not trying to intimidate you, but you probably appear to be under the age of 25 or so and they're playing it safe. The employees in an individual store won't know that someone already asked you unless they saw it. It's not as though they wear secret service radios and exchange info on the topic.

But is having nearly every employee in there ask me for ID necessary? And the cashier definitely knows I've been asked before, I wouldn't have been able to get into the store without being ID'd. The second employee asked for ID in the fridge was about 10 feet behind the initial ID'er and was looking in the same direction. I'm almost certain he did see us get ID'd.    I'm just wondering why they have so many people do it. ID people when they go to buy the alcohol. If they're really concerned then on the way in and during purchase would suffice too.

To answer your question, RO concentrates the contaminants from the fracking waste water but the RO process creates it's own waste water which will contain the concentrated contaminants which will have to be dealt with.    The effectiveness of the proposed process depends entirely on how it's implemented, the contaminants in need of removal (not all contaminants can be be removed by RO) and what is to be done with the concentrated waste created as a by-product of the RO process.    Here is a basic Wikipedia article on RO.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis"
NovaScotia,2krifw,JabberJaahs,1 point,Thu Nov 6 00:07:48 2014 UTC,"Reverse osmosis:       Reverse osmosis (RO) is a water purification technology that uses a semipermeable membrane. This membrane technology is not properly a filtration method. In reverse osmosis, an applied pressure is used to overcome osmotic pressure, a colligative property, that is driven by chemical potential, a thermodynamic parameter. Reverse osmosis can remove many types of molecules and ions from solutions, and is used in both industrial processes and the production of potable water. The result is that the solute is retained on the pressurized side of the membrane and the pure solvent is allowed to pass to the other side. To be ""selective"", this membrane should not allow large molecules or ions through the pores (holes), but should allow smaller components of the solution (such as the solvent) to pass freely.

Instead they picked a location that is 4 hours from a major city and about 8 hours from the other side of the province and it is also about 6 hours from the N.B. border this project was going to fail from the start.

NovaScotia,2jvicz,Killi_Vanilli,2,Tue Oct 21 19:18:59 2014 UTC,They use the shortest distance because the thing goes 38km/h and burns a shitload of fuel.

NovaScotia,2jvicz,thetallones,1 point,Tue Oct 21 23:09:46 2014 UTC,Halifax to Boston that many people think is better is almost twice the distance so you would assume it would take 20 hours instead. So you leave at 9am on Monday and arrive in Boston Tuesday morning at 5am  The boat was built to cross the English channel. Can it carry enough supplies for a 20 hour cruise?  Next you have to consider how much more that would cost. People complain the existing ferry is too expensive.   The idea was to get people to the western side of the province. Halifax has lots of people and lots of tourists already. Now we have people in Halifax driving to Yarmouth to get to the ferry and we have Americans driving to Halifax.
NovaScotia,2jvicz,horbob,1 point,Fri Oct 24 14:05:31 2014 UTC,People don't go to the western side of Nova Scotia. They don't have anything for people to do down that way they land they rent cars and drive to Halifax.
NovaScotia,2jvicz,SchwingSchwanz,8,Fri Oct 24 14:26:20 2014 UTC,"What I want to know is why my goddamn tax dollars are going to fund this private business, when he employs zero Nova Scotians on the boat its self, and a minimum of Nova Scotians in the onshore aspects. Now the business is floundering because they did zero real research into how to run the boat.   The ports it services are Yarmouth and Portland. Yarmouth is about as inconvenient as possible of an entrance to NS. Want to see the Cape Breton Highlands? 8 hours away. 4 hours to the nearest city. And good luck trying to convince anyone other than the people on the south shore (some of the poorest people in Canada by the way) to take the ferry. And coming from Portland, ME, the city is smaller than Halifax! Why wouldn't they base it in Boston, where there's actually a population base who could actually use the ferry? Instead they choose the least populated city on the American east coast, and offer that they come to one of the furthest reaches of Nova Scotia where they'll have to drive for hours just to get anywhere. Oh and it will cost them over $1000.   Shit like this is exactly why people leave NS. We've spent 26 million dollars on this, and he's asking for another 5 million. Why the fuck are we not spending that money on actually stimulating the economy rather than hoping to depend on rich New Englanders coming up to spend a little money on shitty folk art and maybe a bottle of wine?"

NovaScotia,2jr2fl,JDGumby,1 point,Mon Oct 20 11:15:14 2014 UTC,"It receives public money to foster tourism and economic activity by bringing Americans to the province. If the point of putting millions of dollars into the ferry was to employ 130 additional Nova Scotians then it would be one of the dumbest schemes in history.  This is a reasoned, obvious reality that is going to be near-universal. It's a tourist cruise liner, not a local ferry (despite the name). This is how they work. Forcing Nova Scotians onto the ferry at a Nova Scotian wage would only push the liner further into the red and negate any benefit it is bringing to the province.  Either the cost of the ferry is offset by economic benefits or it isn't. If it is then minimizing the outset cost, by saving thousands upon thousands for salary, makes far more sense than destroying that benefit in the name of 130 jobs."
NovaScotia,2jr2fl,argenticake,4,Mon Oct 20 12:26:35 2014 UTC,Pay 26 million to make 16 million. That is some McNeil math for you.
NovaScotia,2jr2fl,argenticake,2,Mon Oct 20 22:10:20 2014 UTC,That's voter logic for you. Look at the price Dexter paid for cancelling it. Why would McNeil repeat that mistake when he is an elected official?  Voters need to stop blaming politicians for doing what they ask for. Ask for smarter things if you want your politicians to do them. That's how democracy works. Blaming politicians for doing what people demand is like blaming rain for being wet: that's the entire point...
NovaScotia,2jr2fl,EmperorOfCanada,7,Mon Oct 20 23:21:46 2014 UTC,"Simply put, the government has to stop trying to pick winners; they really really suck at it.   There is a simple solution, any business that brings money into the province should get a sizeable tax break. If the business can't run with that then maybe it shouldn't run.   What gets me though is that only the NS government seems to be able to lose. The people running the ferry, Maine, the tour operators, etc all see this as a cash cow but its failure will only mean the end of the cash cow, but no penalty to them. But I would not be surprised that NS has huge penalties to pay if this is shut down.  My favourite is that basically every promise has failed to materialize. The passenger numbers, the ferry being busy in the winter, the time of year that it runs, and best of all the money that this was supposed to cost. The province keeps throwing money into it when they could at least extract massive concessions such as buying stuff from NS, eliminating any nasty contractual surprises,  get way more NS people working for the company, and did I mention getting the contract reworked so that the province doesn't end up holding the bag.   The Governor of Maine is brilliantly handling this. He is saying, we''ll back this with 5 million LOC on the 23rd of Never. In the meantime keep sending us NS money.  But my biggest problem with this stupid ferry is that it goes nowhere. Portland, who the hell wants to go to Portland? I want to go to Boston or New York. What I would have liked to see was a walk on ferry in Halifax that skipped down to Yarmouth and then on to Boston or NYC. I would then take the ferry by foot and skip the drive to Yarmouth.   But seeing that the ferry costs 1 million dollars for a return ticket, plus the massive nickel and diming that they do on the ferry, I'll fly or drive."
NovaScotia,2jr2fl,EmperorOfCanada,2,Mon Oct 20 18:46:50 2014 UTC,We voted in a Party that basically came back from the dead based on the Ferry. They are never going to end. It is a terrible deal but the 26 million loss is worth it for Zach Churchills seat end of story.
NovaScotia,2jr2fl,EmperorOfCanada,1 point,Mon Oct 20 22:12:12 2014 UTC,"I was trying to work out the political math on this one. They can't cut the ferry too close to an election, but they have to give it a chance. So my guess is that they will let the bleeding run right through next summer. But then they will call in some external auditor to point out the obvious; that the cons outweigh the pros by far. Then they will kill it.  Then they have two years before the next election; an election that they will lose to the conservatives because we will somehow delude ourselves that it will be completely different, ""This time"".  All this is predicated upon the assumption that the ferry will still be a money losing flop next summer.   But this won't the last stupid spending. Let's make a list of things that they will then blow money on over the next few years:   Call center rebates never go out of style. The IBM IT contract will need some expansion. The shipbuilding contract will be in trouble after Trudeau gets elected so they will try to throw some money to the Irvings. Nothing beats a good environmental cleanup. They will pick up the tab for some rich company's mistake. 800 studies to keep their friends employed. Studies that will show that people are leaving the province because there are no good jobs. Studies that show we live on the ocean. Studies that say we need to change all kinds of obvious things. And a pension bailout. Some pension will need to be bailed out and the boomer recipients are solid voters. And last but not least; it will turn out that shutting the ferry down will cost a bloody fortune. I wouldn't be surprised that NS ends up writing a check to Maine."

They swoon over some sophisticated but crappy company from the big city of Toronto. They get federal money that forces them to use a Quebec supplier. Or they hire some political friend who are too inexperienced to avoid stepping on a single project landmine. This last one seems to be the case with the bluenose project.   The last thing they ever do is just hire someone local who is clearly able to deliver on time and on budget because they have a long track record of actually doing so. Often competent companies won't deal with the government because they won't suffer fools. Or they have moved away and aren't local anymore."

I think tourism helps keep that half of our province alive.  Now, I am not sure why the ferry they chose is quite so luxurious. A simple A to B basic ferry would have probably been better, but hindsight is 20/20.  Are there any studies done to show the tourism benefit/income from having this international link? If so, I'd like to see that information before jumping to any conclusions.  I know it is comparing apples to oranges, but there have been many instances of NS government subsidizing things in the past. This one has the benefit of keeping half of our province out of perpetual welfare and turning into ghost towns."

Not sure why we spend 26 million to make 13 million. We would be better off cutting everyone in Yarmouth a check if that is the case.

NovaScotia,2i0s3i,kenmacd,1 point,Mon Oct 6 23:08:07 2014 UTC,"Can't the offender just say   They can, and they can say the same thing if they got the ticket directly from an officer. This is perjury, and is an indictable offence in Canada (ie felony for US cop shows). The original ticket is a summary offence (misdemeanor in US) with a small fine, perjury could lead to a 14 year jail sentence.  But saying they're willing to risk up to 14 years in jail to avoid a ticket, the judge will decide the case based on reasonable doubt.  If there's no connection between the accused and the witness, or other known reason for the witness to lie, then the judge will generally accept their testimony as truthful, as typically people don't go around reporting strangers for no reason.  People are much more likely to lie about being on their phone than to lie about someone else being on a phone. That said if the accused shows up to court with a stack of hate-email from the witness it'd be a different story. The same if the witness isn't sure if it was actually the accused or his twin brother.  Officers that issue tickets are still just witnesses when they show up at court. They tend to be more trusted as they hopefully have less reason to lie, but to the judge they're like you or me, someone that saw what happened.  Also I would bet when the officer goes to talk to the person they attempt to get them to admit they were on the phone. In that case you'd have the evidence of the witness and the officer.  To make the actual conviction there doesn't have to be absolute proof (whatever that would be), just beyond a reasonable doubt."

The bill suspends the trades union act in this province for health care workers so that workers have no say in who represents them. It means workers can't vote to change unions or to have a new union. It essentially strips the NSGEU of approximately 9000 employees and shuffles workers into other unions. This affects everyone, and it should concern Nova Scotians, as the libs/tories are passing unconstitutional legislation. Further, the libs just wasted several hundred thousand dollars in developing Essential Services Legislation with NSGEU. With the new union shuffle, that process will have to start all over again, with more tax dollars down the drain. As a health care worker, I see so much waste within the system, and my coworkers and I try to rein some of that in at the front line. I can provide examples if you like. Please don't dismiss this legislation as ""what health care workers deserve""."
NovaScotia,2hw9d5,nobleman76,1 point,Wed Oct 1 13:32:15 2014 UTC,"Can you describe how healthcare workers are able to select which union they participate with? (serious question) And as a follow up, why is being able to chose from several unions a benefit?"
NovaScotia,2hw9d5,WhinoRD,1 point,Wed Oct 1 22:35:43 2014 UTC,"Years ago, the workers chose which union to represent them, and the current trades union bill allows workers to vote to decide on a new union if they are dissatisfied with the current representation once their contract expires. Even though RN's and LPN's are NSGEU at the QE2, if they were dissatisfied, they could vote to join CUPE, UNIFOR, or NSNU. By permanently suspending the trades union bill for (for health care workers only), the province is taking away our right to choose our representation.     Having the choice of several unions probably ensures unions do their best to keep workers satisfied with the representation they provide, but I am sure there are others who could more eloquently answer this question. Also, technically, if we didn't like any of the choices, we could form our own union. With this bill, the four existing health care bargaining units are the only ones that will ever represent the workers. And no two classes of workers can ever be represented by the same union - e.g., clerical and nursing can no longer be represented by the same organisation, ever.  This legislation tramples on freedom of association. It also provides the employer a say in who represents their workers, but the workers have no say. Even the most anti-union Nova Scotian should be concerned by this bill, as it provides precedent for a provincial legislature to pass unconstitutional bills. Currently it's health care workers, but other provincial services: corrections, education, etc., can now technically be subject to future, unconstitutional legislation."

Not to mention reductions in the number of engineers and other technical staff they employ... The remaining technical staff are all fleeing to Enmax in Calgary."
NovaScotia,2hn69o,manchap,4,Sun Sep 28 21:41:17 2014 UTC,"NSP says It'll be back on by 6 am.  We'll bring a bucket of water, candle, and small flashlight by your room shortly. Hope you enjoy your stay at White Point...  True story."

NovaScotia,2hlvjq,JDGumby,8,Sat Sep 27 10:51:27 2014 UTC,If you need to pass a law in order to give yourself a chance in a lawsuit - you probably don't have a very good case.
NovaScotia,2hlvjq,derfolly,5,Sat Sep 27 12:37:23 2014 UTC,"They could pass a law that allows me to sue people who vote me down, but any good judge will look at the law and ask, ""What is the point? You either have a case or you don't have a case.""  This sounds like a bunch of guys who are staring at the hard problems that they aren't smart or daring enough to solve, and trying to fool us into thinking they are doing something. It would have literally been a better way to spend their time had they had gone out and raked leaves around the legislature. (But neither is a good way to spend the citizens' money.)"

NovaScotia,2hk2zi,EmperorOfCanada,3,Fri Sep 26 20:02:38 2014 UTC,For those prices they clearly flew first or business class. Quite simply the government should not be flying first/business class at all.  They all argue that the better seating makes them better rested for their business when they arrive; but it is the crappy air that wipes you out the same crappy air in the whole airplane.   First/business class is purely for their egos.
NovaScotia,2hj8ax,RangerNS,1 point,Fri Sep 26 15:16:18 2014 UTC,I amazed anyone would ever want to be a nurse. Old people + bedpans = a recipe for disaster. What a shitty job that must be...
NovaScotia,2hj8ax,manchap,1 point,Sun Sep 28 21:51:38 2014 UTC,"Hello again. Yes, I help people use bedpans. I also insert catheters, apply condom catheters (yes, they're a thing), help people on and off commodes and the toilet. As an RN I monitor and assess my patient's systems. So, monitoring elimination is part of the job. Constipation is serious business. Digital disimpaction is part of my job description too. And to be perfectly honest, there is much worse in the health care field than normal stool. But I also monitor and assess cognition, respiratory, integument, etc. etc. I have picked maggots out of black and rotting feet, and packed wounds where I have been able to see a person's coccyx. And that's just the physical aspects. Nursing care also provides for psycho-social and spiritual care. I communicate with people who have JUST been told their cancer is terminal, that their loved one has died, etc. I do more than just ""old people and bed pans"". And I love my job. But Nova Scotia is an old and aging province. I believe Lunenburg is the oldest community in North America (source: a Public Health Nurse from Lunenburg mentioned that at Bill 37 Law Amendments).  What else do I do... oh, I deal with families too - so patients with 4 or 5 adult children...sometimes all those children will phone me and ask the same questions. In a 12 hour shift that can be 25-35 mins just dealing with families on one patient, and I can have 4-8 patients. Time management is crucial, as well as a working and thorough knowledge of medications, dressings, anatomy and physiology, etc."

NovaScotia,2hj8ax,manchap,0,Thu Oct 2 19:49:06 2014 UTC,Taking away a peoples right to vote on their union representation is not only wrong it is the violation of a fundamental freedom. The Liberals are the Party of the charter so why doesn't McNeil know anything about that document?
NovaScotia,2hgvh8,jonhiseler,6,Thu Sep 25 21:23:00 2014 UTC,"Carload of drugs in this case is actually an ""Undisclosed amount""."
NovaScotia,2hgvh8,EmperorOfCanada,3,Thu Sep 25 23:02:47 2014 UTC,"One of the most successful drug policemen in the US for years was a State Trooper on the i95. He had the most drug arrests, the most value in drugs seized, and the most weight.   On retirement he admitted that his technique was simple. He pulled over every black teenager who was driving north in a rental.... at the exact speed limit.  So I guess driving drunk is even worse."

NovaScotia,2hbrfu,fadetowhite,3,Wed Sep 24 15:37:39 2014 UTC,I was raised in Nova Scotia and moved away not long after high school because there was no work to be found. Left in 1989 and was really ashamed at the levels of racism against any non white person and bigotry against the LGBT community.  Came back to Nova Scotia in 2010. I could not believe what fantastic progress had been made.

NovaScotia,2h66vn,coldbrook,5,Mon Sep 22 22:32:32 2014 UTC,There are A LOT of locals who are against shutting down the small airport.
NovaScotia,2h66vn,Cephiroth,5,Tue Sep 23 11:57:02 2014 UTC,"Michelin says they have no plans to expand their factory. And while small, that little airport generated a couple million in revenue for the county just by being there, having a little flight school, and the parachuting outfit. All of these things shut down so Michelin can purchase an airport as if it was just a fallow field. They would be fools not to buy it at that price. But it doesn't do the county any good to lose Waterville."

NovaScotia,2gzq04,jonhiseler,2,Sat Sep 20 23:43:03 2014 UTC,"What a load of crap. This store has been open and closed all the time over the last few years. Everyone goes to Digby or Annapolis unless they need a one off ingredient for supper and can't wait.  The store has, as the article said never made money, but it's gone so far as the county propping up the store by taking on a large part of the stores rent to try and keep it open.  The idea that this will cause a huge loss in the area is silly. Sure it sucks to lose more jobs in the area, but the store itself as a loss is about as likely to affect the community as the other half a dozen times its closed.  All the community needs is a corner store which it already has, that's been able to hold it's own for years now unlike this grocery store."
