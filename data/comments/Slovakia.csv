Slovakia,3e6ftu,Cpteleon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:04:13 2015 UTC,"Hello. You can take a bus from Krakow to Poprad and to either Stary Smokovec or Tatranska Lomnica from there. These two villages/small towns are good entry places to Tatras and you can rent a hotel there.  However, depending on how much time you want to spend in Tatras, you might want to plan your trip out a bit better. Tatras are not small and a lot of places are worth seeing.  Good luck and enjoy your stay! :)"
Slovakia,3e6ftu,foxicatko,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:02:20 2015 UTC,"Hello, (Cześć?)    travelling to the High tatras, you basically want to get to Poprad-Tatry first. Should you start in Bratislava, the train ride is indeed gonna take a while (~4hours) as it is ~350 kms away. To plan your ride, I'd suggest http://cp.atlas.sk/vlak/spojenie/, there's an english button in the lower right parts of the site, above the ads. There's a more official site for it, where you can even book your tickets, but it doesn't display commercial trains, only state ones, which brings me to another point: If your schedule isn't too tight, I'd recommend chosing any of the RegioJet trains. They are usually cheaper and despite that, more comfortable, especially for the international passengers. As a downside, they are usually sold out days in advance, but don't worry, you can book your tickets at https://jizdenky.studentagency.cz/?1 (english button at top). The official site, where the tickets for other trains can be booked at is http://www.slovakrail.sk/en.html. Keep in mind while planning your ride there, that this site doesn't display all the possible options.       Now, for the much easier part, starting from Kraków: visit https://jizdenky.studentagency.cz/?1, enter Kraków and Poprad and you should find three available connections for whatever day. The first one takes the longest as it requires a brief stop in Ostrava and a change from bus to a train, while the two others are direct bus rides.      And finally, for reaching the High Tatras/the national park, you need to take a tram from the Poprad-Tatry station. Here's a simple map of where you can get by train and here is a nice tourist routes map for a better overview, or in case you don't know where you want to go yet. When you know where, all you need to do is look up a connection at http://www.slovakrail.sk/en.html and either buy a ticket beforehand, or buy it directly at the station. You can also try http://cp.atlas.sk/vlakbus/spojenie/ for connections, which includes busses, in case you don't want to wait for a tram, feel adventurous, and trust in your communication skills with people most likely having little to no english knowledge.       That should cover it, feel free to ask for more in case I've missed something:) And enjoy your trip"

Slovakia,3dx7nq,bajaja,2,Mon Jul 20 08:23:49 2015 UTC,"Hi. I am working on the same thing so let me add some of my notes.  first off, I am a Slovak who has moved away but had taken almost every trail in Slovakia before. so I am researching stuff for children and new aquaparks.  regarding main sights, it is surely the peak trail (or whatever you call the trail connecting the highest points of the mountain range). if you cannot make it all, favorite trails are Telgart - Kralova Hola, Certovica - Dumbier, north or south trail to Chopok, Donovaly or Korytnica to Prasiva.  next one is the caves, there is Demanovska jaskyna but couple others too: http://www.ssj.sk/sk/spristupnene-jaskyne-ssj  then, for families, aquaparks: Tatralandia, Besenova, Poprad, Liptovsky Jan (2x), Podbanske.  First two are expensive. Also the gondola lifts are expensive (e.g. to Chopok). there are discount cards. Liptov Card and Tatry card - not so helpfull, 1EUR off usually. I am considering the Multiticket Fun Tatry - https://www.gopass.sk/ako-funguje-gopass/multiticket.html - which should contain both best aquaparks and a roundtrip to Chopok by the gondola lift.  this is what I am planning: 5 nights in pension near Poprad. 1 trip to High Tatras - most probably a lift to Solisko or a cablecar to Hrebienok + a walk. 1 trip to Slovak paradise - most probably Sucha Bela. 2 aquapark trips. then a gondola lift to Chopok, walk to Chata M.R.Stefanika - preordered for 1 night, then the evening trip to the peak of Dumbier - hoping for the chamoises, I promised them to the kids, otherwise they eat me alive - then down and to home."
Slovakia,3dx7nq,bajaja,2,Mon Jul 20 16:08:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Solisko was a great hike, one of my favorites, especially if you don't have a full day. I've never heard of Telgart-Krakova Hola. How long would that take, and how would you get there?  We are going to be visiting at least one of the caves, and are leaning toward Demanovska jaskyna. I'm worried that there'll be too many people, though, as it's so popular.  It would be incredible to see a chamois. Hopefully you do! :)"
Slovakia,3dx7nq,bajaja,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:28:33 2015 UTC,"re Telgart - Kralova Hola. my idea was that if you don't want to hike the whole red trail - which is amazing btw and can be split into 2-6 days according to your fitness level and kids - you can get to some peak from the bottom to the top as one trip. Telgart is one of the trailheads to Kralova Hola - the most eastern peak, 1946m above sea level and great views.  I think my family wouldn't make this one this year.  I am looking on the tourist layer of www.mapy.cz which has Slovakia as well.  caves - look up if you can't reserve a spot or pick another one, there's four or more?"

Slovakia,3dsyt7,zero86sk,2,Mon Jul 20 04:03:26 2015 UTC,"No problem. The site seems to imply that Macek used to be an old name for Matej. I couldn't find any other sources to support this but as /u/Zippersk said, there is an old folk song that uses Macek as a name. Today, as you can see from other posts, the word has few other meanings. But if it really does come from the name Macek, it probably came to be as many other last names originating in profession or a first name. Your ancestor probably lived somewhere in Austria-Hungary when bureaucracy reached a level where every person had to be registered with two names and he chose his second name for what made him different from other people with his first name which in this situation sounds like being ""son of Macek"". The ""of Macek"" part, in masculine, genitive case can be said in Slovak as a one word, ""Maceka"". But this is just my speculation."

Slovakia,3dsyt7,bajaja,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:51 2015 UTC,It's one of those surnames that don't have any meaning in modern official language.  If you find out which part of Slovakia your family comes from you might try to contact the language office and ask them for help figuring out what it means. The meaning might be very region specific.

Slovakia,3dsyt7,bajaja,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:42:56 2015 UTC,"my five cents:  from the Czech book Nase prijmeni:  Macek  - dam.  podoba  OJ Matěj  - viz  tam;  viz  Máca;  1381 Mathias zvaný Maczek; A  macek  =  dlouhý  hoblík;  Macík,  Macke  (poněmč.  Macek) ,  Macků  (z  příd.  jm.  přivl.)   where OJ is personal (first) name. so the second meaning is a woodworker's plane.  this is why the gut feeling of regular redittors don't work here. the language has changed a lot.  also still the name can mean something else. is it Maceka or Mačeka? it's somehow modified or maybe coming from some other language.  also the name seems rare, some hits on SK facebooks and only 4 guys in CZ - all in Prague as nice well-behaving Slovaks would move to. http://www.kdejsme.cz/prijmeni/Maceka/ . that's why I suspect someone modified a letter not long ago."

Slovakia,3dfgpr,anc1en7,4,Wed Jul 15 21:19:07 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend the following:  Inbound trip:   Take one of the RegioJet company buses from Bratislava to Banska Bystrica, you should be able to catch the one that leaves at 10:30. The bus only stops at one other point during the trip, offers free coffee, WiFi and other services and is ridiculously comfortable, so it's definitely your best choice for the first part of the trip. Budget - 5€ Once in Bystrica, take any of the local bus connections to Jasenie. There is a bus that leaves at 15:32 and takes you directly to the place, with the arrival at 16:13. This will allow you to take a two hours' break in downtown Banska Bystrica; that is, if you're not intimidated by the admittedly disgusting corpse of a bus station. From there, it's a walking distance to the center, which is breathtaking. Budget - 2.10€.   Outbound - you should be able to do the same on the 27th. Use CP and RegioJet to look for convenient connections between Jasenie - Bystrica and Bystrica - Bratislava, respectively.  Your overall budget - not exceeding 15€."
Slovakia,3dfgpr,satelit1984,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:13:54 2015 UTC,"The RegioJet option sounds good! Do you know if they have electric plugs? Staying in Bystrica sounds like something I want to avoid, though. Since we're four passengers I could image to share a cab at a reasonable price. Any idea how much that might cost?  Thanks!"
Slovakia,3dfgpr,satelit1984,2,Thu Jul 16 18:38:13 2015 UTC,"The cab services around Bystrica are designed to be used for travel within the city or to the surrounding vilages at most, I would imagine preparing around 30 euros for a cab to Jasenie, and that's if you know who to ask so you don't get ripped off.  If you're a party of 4, I'd definitely recommend to travel with RegioJet to Bystrica and, afterwards, buy train tickets to Predajná, which is along the main eastbound track, and taking a short hike to Jasenie, which is some 2 kilometers to the north. Don't expect the locals to speak English though, so just learn to pronounce ""Jasenie?"" (""Yasenye"") and you're good following whichever direction they throw their hands at.  Hope this helps. :)"

They compared the average price of twelve beers, of which one half they bought in bars and the second half in retail outlets. They always bought five of the most known world brands and one local brand so that results would be comparable in all 75 cities. But, for example, imported beers in the Czech Republic are much more expensive than those from local breweries. Thus as a consequence, while the ranking put the average beer price at €2.38 or CZK64.6 for 330 ml, the Czech Statistical Office puts the price of 0.5 ml of lager at CZK.77, Hospodárske Noviny pointed out."

There are some exceptions, but Hungary isn't one of them. In most cases you can buy the tickets on the website of the other country's railways. Hungarian side allows buying international tickets online but unfortunately you have to pick up the tickets in person. If you have a friend that's already in Slovakia you can ask them to buy you the tickets in person. If you don't your best chance is to go to a train station as the first thing after you arrive in the country and buy it.  To answer your question: yes, you can (and in your case you have to) simply buy the tickets at any station in the country. It might happen that the train will be sold out by that time depending on how popular it is. It is necessary to buy specific seats for certain cars / classes (you will be assigned seats automatically) for other cars it might be a good idea to pay extra to get a reserved seat.  You can theoretically request a reservation on this email address, but I have no experience with that: rip.ba@slovakrail.sk It's a direct address to the reservation office.  Be prepared that the person behind the counter at the station will speak very basic English.

The Tatras themselves should be amazing :-)     Good luck and enjoy our small country.    Edit: you should buy tickets in advance"
Slovakia,3cp9pe,NicoleTheLizard,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:07:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the quick reply! :) So the site shows me the connection but I again can't find any way to book a ticket? We want to leave Poprad on august 9th, when I check the departing train at 16:32 and click Seat Availability it shows the total amount of seats in the train but not how many are available orso, is it still too early? It's only a month away.."
Slovakia,3cp9pe,symon6,3,Thu Jul 9 18:24:22 2015 UTC,"There is no option to buy ticket on-line to international train. You must visit ticket office. Anyway, I think you don't need to buy ticket in advance. It is enough to buy it day before.  Consider this option, if you will travel more by train: http://www.eurail.com (I personally have no experience).  Probably best site to prepare trip is this: http://mapy.hiking.sk It is Slovak only, but try it with dictionary. If you zoom in, you will see red, blue, green and yellow lines, which are hiking trails."

Slovakia,3c8gcf,half-thaietitian,4,Sun Jul 5 21:49:15 2015 UTC,I don't think there is a place where you can buy them. There are competitions sometimes. Or they hand them out for free. But no shop anywhere.

Slovakia,3c8gcf,_RoToR_,3,Tue Jul 7 06:11:54 2015 UTC,Yes. It may be possible. But it depends on restaurant. I dont think they can just sell the glasses. You can always just hide them from waiters in your bag O:-).
Slovakia,3c8gcf,_RoToR_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:23:31 2015 UTC,We were able to get a mug from a little cafe in Pieštany. We tipped the waiter when he just let us have it. :)

Slovakia,3c4nys,theTobix,3,Sat Jul 4 19:16:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't notice this post, I hope you're still interested.  If you're interested in ""secrets"", I would highly suggest Wandering in Kosice, available also in English, where a guide will take you to many places/buildings in the historic centre which are not usually open for public, palaces, old churches, etc...Last time I was lucky to get into Jakabov palac, which is one of the most beatiful buildings in the old town, but closed for public. You should check the schedule on these wanderings...  Urban exploration - there's an old magnesite factory here, (street view) or a fallout shelter here (you have to get through a hole in a fence, very easy) but it's already missing its huge leaden doors.  Beatiful nature - maybe Vyhliadkova veza (no idea how to get an English page...) with great views on the city, very nice in the late evenings.  If you're really into nature you obviously have to go a bit further from the city, if you get around by car, go to Ruzin lake, you will definitely enjoy the ride, this is my favorite road in the city to drive and you get to see very nice hills and the lake which is huge and strangely shaped in the valley. If you hike, try to get directions to Sivec (high hill at the lake), takes about 1-2 hours to get there, not very difficult (except the rocky top) and the view is really great.  Leave a comment or send PM if you're looking for something more specific."

The Transport Office will happily accept a printed copy of your PZP, but you must have proof that you’ve paid for it so that they can see it’s valid.   IIRC, I didn't have to have a proof that I paid for the PZP, the biela karta (white card) itself is the proof. Did your policeman really checked the payment order?   technical document (shown above) must be with you when driving and it is valid for 30 days   These days the techničák comes in two forms - ""shortened"" plastic (a.k.a časť 1 - part 1 or malý - little) and ""full"" foldable A4 paper (a.k.a časť 2 or veľký - big). I started driving only a couple years ago but I remember from the past when there was only the paper form that its validity is not limited to 30 days - it's valid as long as the car's registration is valid. My father has one older car and he does not have the plastic form of techničák for it - he always brings the folded paper document. I think the police officer tried to say you'll receive the plastic card within a 30 day period and then you should drive with it, not with the paper form. The reason is just pragmatic - the paper form tends to worn out."

That being said, their actual coffee is bleh at best. I did notice the coffee at the one in Vienna was different from the ones in Wisconsin and Illinois back in the US.

Do you know if any of them have committed crimes? Do you know if any of these people are wanted? Are they educated? Do they have families? No. You know nothing about these people. Period.

Slovakia,3axuu5,incontournable,11,Wed Jun 24 11:08:42 2015 UTC,"Ideally gross salary should be about 1200 a month minimum. After Tax and Social Insurance Contributions this puts you about 900 a month net.  Then 300-350 for a single room in a flat share. 26  a month for your public transport pass. Then however much your phonebill is - average of 20.   That leaves you on average +/- 500. Most places a beer does not go over 2 euros. You can eat out cheap if you go to the right places. Make the effort to cook at home and shop at places like lidl and you should have some cash left over to save.   Clothes are not so cheap in Bratislava - People often go to Austria / Hungary / Poland on shopping trips for clothes. But of course there are options you just need to look and maybe avoid known brands. Or buy online.  Bu yeah, If you wanna have your own room, have a social life and maybe put something in the bank minimum is 1200."

Slovakia,3axuu5,patronix,4,Wed Jun 24 11:52:20 2015 UTC,Nové Mesto (New Town) is close and has more affordable rents + very good public transport availability.
Slovakia,3axuu5,kzr_pzr,2,Wed Jun 24 13:19:29 2015 UTC,"I assume you're from Portugal. I've been to Portugal in 2000, when Slovakia was still relatively poor and Portugal was relatively rich (compared to Slovakia at that time). We've grown a lot since then, especially Bratislava and prices have gone up as well. Assuming you're really from Portugal, you won't find Bratislava a cheap place to live. Not too expensive either, but definitely not cheap.  Regarding the cost of living - it's probably similar to Lisbon in 2005. Think about how much money you would have needed for a decent life in Lisbon in 2005 and that's how much you'd need in Bratislava today. Rent for one room is €200 - €250. The person who says it's €300 - 350 is exaggerating.  You'll get food vouchers from your employer, that you can use to pay in restaurants or for food in supermarkets. You'll probably get vouchers worth €3,50 per working day, i.e. €70 - €80 per month, but you have to pay about 30% and your employer will pay 70%. You'll also probably get other vouchers worth €15-€20 per month that you can use in some stores and supermarkets. If your net salary (čistá mzda) is €900, you'll probably receive € 875 in your bank account, and you'll receive vouchers worth €90 at the beginning of every month, so your real net salary would be around €965.  As to where you should live - I would recommend you to live close to your place of work, ideally 10-15 min. by feet. I assume you'll be working for a multinational corporation that's situated in the city center or not far away from the center. In that case, you should live in Stare Mesto, Nove Mesto, or Ruzinov.  Public transportation is decent, but some buses are overcrowded in the morning. Forget the ""outer boroughs"" like Petrzalka, Dubravka, Karlova Ves and Raca. Rents are cheaper there, but you'll spend more time commuting and you won't be able to go to the city center on foot or return home on foot at 2am in the morning.  EDIT: Raca is indeed an outer borough."

Slovakia,3axuu5,Sharkpoofie,2,Sun Jun 28 09:05:41 2015 UTC,"It depends on where you live in Raca. If you live near Polus, you're close to shopping, restaurants and entertainment and possibly to your place of work, if you work in one of those skyscrapers. You can walk from Polus to the city center in 40 minutes. If you live in Petrzalka near TESCO and you want to go home from the city center, it would take you at least an hour on foot. Every place in Bratislava that's within 40 minutes on foot from the center is not part of the outer boroughs for me.  I realize that that's my just personal preference, but I've met many people who like to walk on a regular basis for 30-40 minutes, but not more than an hour."

When my husband and I were telling people about our move here, they didn't know where Slovakia was until we mentioned Czechoslovakia - then the lightbulb went on. When we tell them about the Velvet Revolution and Divorce, they're surprised. Although to be fair, we didn't know about it either until a few years ago."
Slovakia,39rqtn,HysniKapo,10,Sun Jun 14 02:55:16 2015 UTC,"I'm only about halfway through the first chapter, but it's clear the author was either a shill or a proper idiot.  ""Yeah, the Western culture is inaccessible or outright illegal, but Czechoslovakia has a lot of their own cultural produce, so no problem, right? Plus, you can't get Rudé Právo in London, either!""  edit: a few pages later:  ""I believe that the socialism in Czechoslovakia was indeed under threat from within and from the west in 1968; and see the intervention that took place as necessary for prevention of a counter-revolution.""  I'm done."
Slovakia,39rqtn,unicycling_dinosaur,5,Sun Jun 14 14:04:34 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the author's wasn't saying ""oh hey they suppress all Western culture but you can't read the KSČ's newspaper in London either!"" He was arguing that Western culture was very much in existence in Czechoslovakia both formally (through state-sanctioned pop songs and fashion meant to mimic the West) and informally (with actual Western songs and other aspects of culture being tolerated to a greater or lesser extent depending on the subject.)  The book's observations obviously need to be treated with caution considering hindsight and the actual experiences of Czechs and Slovaks, but the popular perception in the West was that Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 80s was a cultural desert deprived of any access to Western music and movies and where the only forms of entertainment available were folk ensembles singing of eternal glory to the KSČ and movies where Heroic Steelworker #212 overfulfills his work norm by a hundred billion percent while pledging eternal loyalty to the KSČ.  Songs produced inside the country with official permission were ""Westerned"" in some way. For example:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5TYg20U8MQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD4Aae-DfN0   Of course if you went ""too far"" then your music career could be cut short, at least for a few years, but the essential point the author is making on the subject seems valid IMO."
Slovakia,39rqtn,unicycling_dinosaur,7,Sun Jun 14 14:43:13 2015 UTC,"The author chooses to ignore the vast censorship, lack of democracy and the general repressive nature of the regime, because some parts of the western culture were either accessible illegally, or, for the small parts deemed not dangerous, even officially.  As for the 1968 invasion remark, that's where he lost all my benefit of doubt. I'm not even going to go through what's wrong with that sentence, I don't need to get pissed off  on a nice Sunday."

I'm for making it as strict as possible and allowing in solely those that pass whatever the strict expectations are. Quotas are useless. Only exception is refugges of war."
Slovakia,39g0he,tobuno,5,Thu Jun 11 15:10:26 2015 UTC,There's an awful lot of war refugees in the Middle East and Africa. I don't see how limiting it to war refugees will make any difference.
Slovakia,39g0he,time_to_despair,3,Fri Jun 12 08:56:22 2015 UTC,"I'm against forced immigration entirely. Coming from the US, it's been forced on people for years because it gets presidential canidates their votes. It's only caused problems. Not just crime, but job loss for actual citizens.  Greece via OSAC - ""Rates of street crimes (pickpocketing, purse snatchings, and other crimes of opportunity) continue to be high, and statistics show an increase compared to 2013.""  Italy via OSAC -  ""The Rome RSO Office has been informed through its official contacts that crime has increased significantly over the past year.""  These are two countries who have been taking immigrants for years. Their crime rates are just going up nonstop. To have this being forced is terrible. What about the citizens of the EU countries. Tourism is dropping in countries with immigration due to crimes. Safety for the citizens is dropping due to immigration.  I understand some of these countries have extremely bad situations, but forcing countries to take on their ""refugees"" who end up being bad apples, is not going to help anyone but themselves.  Look at France. They took in a bunch of gypsies. They let them live there. Years later they did everything they could to kick them out after realizing what they did to a competent society. Look at my examples of Italy and Greece. Is this what all of EU wants to become? Of course not.  Now, it's not just about crimes either. Tens of thousands have lost jobs in the US due to immigrants who are willing to work for a 5th of the cost. Look at California. If the job doesn't require 100% fluent English, then good luck being a citizen who keeps their job. My dad was the head of maintence a massive apartment complex. Every employee who got hired and worked under him ended up being a Hispanic who could barely speak English. My dad had to end up learning quite a bit of Spanish just so he could speak to them. The average Salary for non-Hispanics at that job was $14/hour. The Hispanics were working for $6/hour.  Now, is that the immigrants fault? I would say yes and no. It's the employers fault for being willing to pay under the table to avoid higher costs, but also Hispanics for coming to the country and then taking any jobs they can get at whatever price they can get, because it's better than the jobs where they come from.  Summary / TL;DR - Forced immigration cause raises in crime and unemployment of actual citizens."
Slovakia,39g0he,WineVirus,2,Fri Jun 12 10:56:23 2015 UTC,"I really can't decide. On the one hand it's not really great to have thousands of immigrants here (it's harsh, but we have enough gypsies already), who don't know our language, are from totally different culture etc. On the other hand, if they don't have anywhere to go and are running from war.   But distributing them around Europe like some kind of commodity is not the best option."
Slovakia,39g0he,Pascalwb,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:31:52 2015 UTC,"To solve the immigration problem, we need to work in regions where the immigrants are from: in ideal word, the refugees should come to the first safe country only and not try to reach Europe on tumbly boats, the economic immigrants should stay where they are and take part in the normal immigration process (although I understand why they don't, since they'd never get here otherwise).  But we need to care for the people who all already here, since it's not like we have the option to send (vast majority of them) home. I agree that each country should chip in and take their share of immigrants to take the load of Italy, Malta, Greece etc. And seeing how we fight accepting even the few hundred refugees (oh, the horror!), quotas seem to be the only way to make sure the Mediterranean country aren't alone in this."

Slovakia,394m0g,Dakujem,9,Tue Jun 9 05:42:04 2015 UTC,"Here we do it at dedicated Police offices (Dopravný inšpektorát).  At first you need to buy mandatory insurance: ""Povinné zmluvné poistenie"", PZP. You can do it online and the price depends on the car's make, age, power, your accident history, and some of your personal details (eg. if you have a kid under 15 it's considerably cheaper). You'll need to show the police a document called ""Biela karta"" (white card) which declares you have bought the insurance. A printed version from online form is sufficent.  Then it depends whether the car is registered in the same district (okres) where you live. If you live in Bratislava: the whole city is considered to be the same district, Bratislava, because there is only one DI office for all administrative districts (BA-I to BA-V). It's an awful place, by the way.  If yes, it's simpler: you'll both (with previous owner) go to DI (sorry, not online) and apply for ""Prevod držiteľa vrámci okresu"" (it translates to something like ""ownership transfer whitin district""). It boils down to filling a paper form, buying ""e-kolok"" (a form of payment) from ATM-like machine at the DI (just make sure you buy the right type, IIRC it's about €30). Don't forget to let a policeman outside of DI office do an inspection of the car and it's papers. You'll need him to stamp your application or the papers and you have to do it before you go to the office clerk.  If you live in different districts then the seller will have to ""odhlásiť"" (unregister) the car at his DI office and you'll have to ""prihlásiť"" (register) at your DI office. You'll be given a new set of car plates, too.  In Bratislava, DI is at Kopčianska street ant it's a hell on Earth. The building itself is an old communist piece never meant to be a public building. It's crowded and not air conditioned. They have way more applicants than they are able to handle so a queue builds up very quickly in the morning. At least there is this time ticket system so you don't have to stand in a literal queue. The policemen are unfriendly, nervous and arrogant. You'll be  able to spot their friends taking precedence. You'll see abiut six clerk windows but only two of them occupied with a policeman at any point in time. They even used to have ""it's forbidden to ask questions"" sign posted in one of the windows. You'll sweat. And then you'll spot guys who have a huge stack of paperwork with them and are at the clerks for unusually long. These are professionals. They are usually car dealers' employees who are doing the first registration of many cars at once. But, given what hell is that place even for a local, you'll probably want to do them the dirty work of dealing with DI for you. It'll cost about 30 to 60 EUR on top of other payments ( insurance and e-kolok).  Good luck!"
Slovakia,394m0g,kzr_pzr,3,Tue Jun 9 06:34:41 2015 UTC,"yes this advice is solid. regarding Kopcianska - it is doable. I recommend doublechecking everything in person with the woman giving informations otherwise you can spend lot of time at the closed office or incorrect door etc.  if you're not doing the most common operation, it is very confusing even for Slovak. but yours should be OK.  just go there, take the forms, talk to the info person, fill everything in etc.  insurance can be done also at the spot, there are offices of 2 insurance companies.  don't trust the websites very much, lot of them are not real state/police but car dealers, insurance etc. and obsolete. the forms can be obsolete, phone numbers wrong etc.  for the peace of mind, take at least half day off, really make a personal visit (even beforehands), maybe take a Slovak with you, be patient.  I bought a car and exported it to Czechia last year, it was crazy, took me a whole day + many hours of preparation, 3 personal visits etc. but really, I have seen much hellish places before (but honestly, not in last ten years...)"
Slovakia,394m0g,bajaja,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:18:56 2015 UTC,"Super, thank you very much for this info.  I've been to the Kopčianska street office once before and you're not wrong, it really is from another world. The car is already registered in BA so that looks like it will help.  If the mandatory insurance is done online, then it should just be a matter of going to the DI and waiting etc. It's a shame the ownership change isn't doable online yet, but it's not the end of the world. I'll just take a book to read.   I've also found this website: http://www.registervozidiel.sk/ where you can check to see if the car is currently under lease (to make sure the owner isn't being dishonest). I don't know however, if there is a similar way to check that the car isn't wanted by debt collectors?"
Slovakia,394m0g,kzr_pzr,3,Tue Jun 9 06:46:54 2015 UTC,"There is a possibility for an originality check (""kontrola originality"") at STK's (Stanica technickej kontroly - technical check station). They'll check for the car in police databases, check if VIN was not manipulated, if all documents are all right etc. However, I don't know if it is usual for the seller to do it (I guess it's not because it costs money :-) ) and I probably won't trust a KO check by seller.  Regarding debt collectors (if you mean those ""nice"" guys we aptly call executors/exekútori/), I'm not aware of any such website. I guess it would need to aggregate data from courts all over the country. Maybe somebody with a better knowledge of a law will know."

Kto ich preverí, kto zaručí že ostanú na SR a budú sa riadiť podľa našich zákonov? Niesom proti priatiu cudzincov na naše územie, ale ty by si si taktiež nepozval domov bývať niekoho, o kom nevieš úplne nič s tým, že akonáhle ho príjmeš, už ho nebudeš vedieť poslať preč. Je tu veľa nedoriešených vecí, ktoré treba dotiahnuť.  Taktiež sa tu potom naskytá otázka, že ak teraz príjmeme xyz utečencov, ako sa zachováme neskôr keď prídu ďalší? Povieme im že žiaľ, už sme naplnili kvóty a viacej už nepríjmeme? Alebo prestanú utekať do EU lebo vedia že tých pred tým priali a ďalších už nie? Čo potom? Treba riešiť príčinu problému a nie jeho dôsledky. Týmto to všetko len oddialime a dodáme si ten falošný pocit ""však sme im pomohli"".  Ďalší dôvod je ten, že mnohý Slováci sa sami cítia byť v zlej finančnej situácii (slabá zamestnanosť, nízke dôchodky) a priatie xyz utečencov, ktorý zaťažia sociálny systém tomu veľmi neprospeje. Ja osobne s tým nesúhlasím. Myslím si že utečenci by sa dali v pohode integrovať do Slovenskej spoločnosti, ale na to by bolo treba vytvoriť projekty a plán ako ich začleniť, vzdelať, naučiť ich našim pomerom a v neposlednom rade aj nejaké tie rekvalifikačné ḱurzy. Ale úprimne. Existuje projekt, ktorý naša vláda dotiahla do úspešného konca a funguje na 100% (alebo aspon na 10%)?  Keď sa teda vyriešia tieto veci, a začne sa riešiť otázka aj ďalej ako len po štátne občianstvo, budem prvý kto ich bude vítať na hraniciach. Tot môj názor :)  Mimochodom ešte k problému autora: Skús požiadať o štátne občianstvo normálne, s tým že popíšeš situáciu v akej si sa ocitol a že si vlastne pôvodom Slovák len sa na teba nevzťahuje výnimka. Minimálne získaš nejaké bonusové body a taktiež je možnosť že ti niekto z úradníkov poradí nejaké tie právne kľučky ako sa dostať k občianstvu."

Takisto, nikdy nevieš, čo je ten cudzinec, ktorého ti vpustia do krajiny zač. Možno ani nebude ovládať náš štátny jazyk, napríklad.  Tretia vec, Slovensko trpí desaťročia (ak nie viac) cigánskym problémom, ktorý stále nie je schopné vyriešiť a ešte cigánov štedro dotuje zo štátneho a toleruje im ich excesy a ""inú mentalitu"". Prijatie vlny imigrantov na územie SR, ak nemáme vyriešených cigánov, je podľa môjho názoru totálnym zlyhaním.  Tí exoti v europarlamente o ktorých pomaly nikto nevie, za čo ich vlastne platia, by sí mohli skúsiť zobrať milých imigrantov k sebe domov, keď nám ich už odklepli."

The only reason its GDP is so high is, I imagine, the giant natural gas bubble it sits on, which has contributed a fair chunk of the country's wealth, little of which returns to the province. Median or average household income or the like might be a better indicator."

Nemyslite si že som nejaký rusofil (bože chráň), ale je to celkom zaujímave že ľudia v dobe tzv. ""diktatúry"" z týchto krajín v tak veľkom počte neutekali ako utekajú teraz. To len taka malá poznámka :)   Osobne si myslím, že treba riešiť príčinu problému a nie jeho dôsledky. Prestať brániť pomoci krajinám len preto že nehrajú s nami a podľa našich pravidiel. Predsa len nepriateľ môjho nepriateľa je môj priateľ. Sýriu buzerujú za použitie barelových bômb, pritom ISIS vyvražďuje celé osady, ničí kultúrne pamiatky a pácha vojnové zločiny všade kam sa dostane. Ako je teda možné že aj napriek tomu že Asad bojuje proti ISIS s plným nasadením stále platí na krajinu zbrojné embargo? Ako je možné, že aj napriek tomu že Asad bol ochotný spolupracovať z Arabskou koalíciu ho aj tak odmietli? Koľko životov stálo to, že tieto dva vojenské útvary nekoordinovali spoločne útoky? Prečo sa skorej nerieši táto téma?  A áno, keď u nás bol socializmus tak krajiny ako Rakúsko poskytli mnohým našim azyl. Ale takmer vždy to boli ľudia vzdelaný, ktorý sa okamžite prispôsobili a nezaťažovali sociálny systém. Nehovorím teda že by sme mali brániť prílevu utečencov, ale aspoň nejaká regulácia z našej strany by prišla vhod. Predsa len je hlúposť aby sme priali každého, koho nám pošle EU a to bez toho, aby sme mali možnosť akokoľvek sa k tomu vyjadriť, zhodnotiť poprípade tomu zabrániť ak nebudeme chcieť priať zrovna toho jedného utečenca, ktorého nám sem pošlú."

Slovakia,36ir1d,bajaja,2,Wed May 20 19:10:02 2015 UTC,"It mostly depends on your preferred taste, as with all food/drinks. For example, mentioning Kozel or Gambrinus, the way that /u/simonko1 just did, among my friends would earn me many confused looks and probably start an arguement or two. Speaking of Slovak beers, I personally prefer Šariš °12, especially when it's on tap. (I sure hope that's how you say it in english) Also, assuming you'll be visiting Bratislava, you may be able to find Kaltenecker, that's a quite highly regarded little brand, brewed in the eastern parts of our country."

There is another group that is vocal about siding with the west. And that's it. The rest of us have actual everyday problems of our own to deal with.
Slovakia,35ptv7,MoravianPrince,2,Tue May 12 17:31:22 2015 UTC,"yeah, I'm no expert. That's just my impression. I wouldn't say they don't care, but Slovaks tend to be quite cynical about politics even domestically, and in this case, they're geographically and financially stuck right in the middle of this. There are just a few far right wing crazies in Slovakia. The majority is happy to be in the EU, but even joining NATO was a bit controversial just because they are a small country and don't want to be part of poking any sleeping bears. Contributing funds from the tiny Slovak budget to support Greece has also been controversial - it seems all these affairs are too large for little Slovakia to be involved in. Again, just my impression."

Slovakia,35ptv7,furiosaurus,6,Tue May 12 20:46:21 2015 UTC,"What good has Russia ever done for Slovakia?    You have pretty much 2 camps pro russia, those who lived through socialism, and those who were born during its end, or after it (logically, but to space it somehow). First group were ""happy"" because they had work, all of them, and they worked from 8am-2pm, government gave them flats, the country was destroying old builidings in some citys and replacing them with new (which today everyone architecturally educated dislikes). Main hobby of the nation was in the pubs, drunkdriving was common (my grandpa managed to climb a tree with V3S truck!), you also had other hobbys, like bookreading. There was very little to choose from, the ""burden"" of free choice and management of their own lives was taken from people and they were mostly content with it. Again, they had place to live, food to eat (although everyone did complain about waiting in lines to get holiday-special oranges). These people didn't want intellectual growth, they just lived they ordinary lives, content with the misery they saw everyday and thought it to be common, normal. Nowadays you have problems with employment, low wages, even lower retirement pays, place-to-live problems, and this was ""nonexistent"" in soc. era. With quotes because it ofcourse existed but was well hidden. Thought there were no junkies here and it existed only in bad americas? False. These people would gladly step into energy harnessing machines of matrix's aliens. Second group are mostly people who hate/dislike democracy because of USA, war and/or political affairs that are still draining this country dry. So yeah, they think, this isn't working, we are poor (which usually they are not, they don't understand the concept of being poor). SOMEONE MUST BE TO BLAME. And there you have it, bad USA is creating war, and good Russia is just defending itself (did you see that video where journalist asks putin something and putin responds with adorable ""You are bullying me, i am just defending myself""). One could say that people want to be ""enslaved"", i am exaggerating, but this concept is existent with people i see and are prorussian. They want to be dependend because they cannot look after themselves. This i think is left-over from socalism-era and if slovakia cannot get rid of it, brains of the nation will continue to flee or be hindered in case they want to stay. One would think that people are able to stand for themselves, to defend their opinions, and try to reach their goals but sadly they were hypnotized and dazed. I am not pro russian or pro western, i always wanted to be pro SLOVAK. I believe this isn't our conflict and would probably be for dividing the ukraine in half, just as in 1993, or make a normal referendum, stop the war. Our slovak grandfathers and grandmothers always said to us to go to school, get education and go away as far as possible, because our land although being beautiful and women nonetheless, will always be poor."

Over the three days of hiking we did, I think I encountered only one trail that said it was closed, but that was only after hiking 2hrs up a mountain to see the third highest waterfall in the Tatras (at which point you would have needed specialty climbing gear, which we didn't have, to continue anyway).  We also went mountain biking along the river near Červený Kláštor.  All in all, I think you'll be fine."
Slovakia,35kz2u,SicilSlovak,2,Mon May 11 14:03:30 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, your previous info was wrong. Many of the hardest, and nicest, trails really do open in June, on the 15th to be exact. A quick web search shows that they are technically in the minority though. Of the ~600 kms of marked trails, ""only"" 230 kms are actually closed. So I'd say there's hope for an enjoyable trip still. You mentioned biking for example. I'm pretty confident in saying that all bike-accessible routes will be fully available when you visit in May. The same goes for all mountain huts, save for one, which are open and reachable during the whole year. I, personally, would definitely suggest visiting Téryho chata, Skalnatá chata and/or Zbojnícka chata. Sliezsky dom's scenery ain't half bad either and is accessible by bike. As for the mountain-gazing that you mentioned, that should be possible aswell, as long as you don't mind looking upwards, instead of downwards :) Here's a quick referrence as to which trails are officially closed until the hiking season starts. They are listed in the third paragraph, the one with the little flags on each line. Yes, I've noticed the page's english support is pretty much non-existent, despite the little flag in the corner.       hope this helps, enjoy your stay and please pray for the trees to grow back asap"

Slovakia,34zw9c,Fokken_Prawns_,12,Tue May 5 23:05:50 2015 UTC,"10 euros each way for a one hour bus or train ride to Vienna.   There is certainly plenty to see in Slovakia (not only in the capital), but it's not touristy. It's more of an adventurous type destination - not in the swinging from jungle vines way, but in the ""hidden castle ruins and unexpected characters you might stumble upon"" kind of way. If you give more info about what kind of things you enjoy, we might be able to provide more guidance. If you're just looking for typical tourist trap stuff, there's mainly just a small pedestrian zone in the center, which is probably why touristy types would call it boring on a tourist survey.  It's also just a few hours from Budapest and about 4.5 hours from Prague. But again, I think there's a lot to love about Slovakia if you spend a little time getting to know it."
Slovakia,34zw9c,wosmo,7,Tue May 5 23:56:39 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with getting out of the city.  If you're into outdoorsy type stuff, Slovakia's got it.  I grew up in Scotland, the Lake District (northwest england) and Ireland, and thought we ""had it"". The Tatry proved me wrong."
Slovakia,34zw9c,cabincrew,1 point,Wed May 6 00:04:42 2015 UTC,Can you give some examples? I'm going as well and this is just the type of thing I'm looking for.
Slovakia,34zw9c,Lolkac,3,Mon Jun 15 18:58:41 2015 UTC,We basically want something of the beaten path while being cheap and offering a place to shop. Plus we are both into food big time.
Slovakia,34zw9c,wosmo,6,Wed May 6 00:03:35 2015 UTC,"Why not take advantage of the small size of Slovakia and make a trek all the way 'round it? You could do one or two nights per town and see much of the nature as well. Something like Bratislava - Trencin - Zilina - Poprad - Kosice - Banska Bystrica - Nitra - Bratislava... You could see a variety of off the path places, each of them just about two hours apart.  There's great homemade style food all over Slovakia that you can just walk around and find without a guidebook. For example, I like this place in Trencin."

Slovakia,34zw9c,inventa13,7,Sat May 9 11:59:14 2015 UTC,"The Slovaks will kill me for saying this, but another option if you're looking to split the trip is Budapest.  The train is pretty frequent, pretty cheap, and (if memory serves) I think about 3 hours? or less.  I don't know about week passes, but both the trains to Vienna and Budapest were around €15  (if you buy in Bratislava! the prices are not the same if you pay for the same trip in Vienna).  For Bratislava itself .. well I like it, but I know enough locals that I'm not really visiting the city itself anymore.  It's a pretty small city, and not particularly touristy (which is part of the attraction for me), so there is a good chance you'll run out of specific things to see sometime on day2.  Honestly, my biggest concern would be that it's perhaps not a trip to make right after Warsaw.  It's going to be a similar mix of old-world charm and soviet brutalist architecture, so it might feel a bit same-y."

Slovakia,34zw9c,lucanaii,3,Wed May 6 00:00:54 2015 UTC,"It'd be a long day, but I think doable.  You can check the train times on http://www.slovakrail.sk - use the 'en' link top-right for english - for an idea of how early&late you can travel.  (although personally, the currency mess would turn me off making it a day trip.  Vienna being on the euro makes that much cleaner)"

It's sad but the city is boring indeed, there is not much to do here. When someone comes to visit me in Bratislava, I have a hard time to make some program for them for more than one day.   There is    the castle but it has not much to do in it Old town, which has .... well pretty much nothing breathtaking Devin which is pretty nice, I must admit and ... that's it I guess. Or Slavin too? I'm not sure if that's worth visit   I would suggest to visit Wiena and make 1 - 2 day trip to Bratislava by train.  Bratislava is great ""Party town"" and is more like an economic, shopping and ""job"" centre of Slovakia but if we are talking about visit for a week ... I'm sorry but no, not at all. If you would like to visit Slovakia I would suggest some city near Tatra mountains (f.e. Poprad) or in Liptov region (btw Bratislavians are regularly traveling there too :) )"
Slovakia,34zw9c,lucanaii,2,Wed May 6 11:22:01 2015 UTC,"please check my other post. yes boring in sense there is no Eiffel tower here but lot of history, lot of nice quiet places (you omitted e.g. Rusovce castle and gardens, Eurovea area for cafes at the river, cheap and OK quality opera, Koliba TV tower with observation desk etc.), there is couple (not many) good restaurants well worth the visit...  also there's lot of nice trips couple kilometers outside the city - either in Slovakia or in Austria and Hungary. lot of options for sightseeing, sports, recreation.  the area is actually quite rich, they just don't work together on common marketing and you have to figure everything out by yourself.  edit - words"

From restaurants I also like BeAbout (burgeeers), new hype place is estevecka although I have yet to check it out. Top 3 burger for me is also Le Beef (food truck) that is usually in front of Cubicon mall (they post their location on facebook).  For beer I absolutely adore Pod Kamennym Stromom which is near the main square, they have Bernard + they cook during the summer season (which started yesterday) really awesome quality food. Another great beer+food spot is Mestiansky Pivovar, both places on Drevena and Dunajska are good. Only for beer is nice and cozy Cierny Pes also in the historical center, no food there (except for some stuff to go with beer).  Just a couple of spots out of the top of my head :D"

Activities in Bratislava and around (except the city centre):   boat trip: to the Devin castle or to the Gabcikovo dam Slavin - memorial with the views Devin castle - historical sight, confluence of two rivers, nice views Sad Janka Krala bike or rollerblade trip at the track by the river trip to Vienna (train, bus or speed boat)   Trip to Small Carpathians (east side):   Cerveny Kamen or Smolenice castle hike in the mountains while there, e.g. Zaruby or the lookout tower above Zochova chata visit Elesko - winery and restaurant at the edge of Modra, also nice piece of architecture Senec lakes for water sports and recreation, also they have a large indoor aquapark   Trip to Hungary:   Mosonmagyarovar spa in colder weather Lipot water park in summer some restaurant or confectionery while there   Trip to Austria:   Carnuntum - Roman remnants Edelstal wine cellars Neusiedler See - the lake, beaches, watersports etc. Nationalpark Seewinkel - Austrian and Hungarian park preserving the nature and original animals of the Danubian region obviously Vienna - main sights + Shopping City Sud for one of the largest european shopping malls"

Of courese there are still some hioden places even people living here havenb´t been but where aren´t. Anyway if you have 7 days to spend i would recommend to either travel other slovak cities or just go to another Capital in area (Wien, Budapest, Prague)."

Kvôli ich vzťahu s Putinovým režimom sa Poľsko a pobaltské krajiny rozhodli, že ich nevspustia na svoje územie, a teda do Schengenského priestoru.

I live near Trebišov, in a bigger county city and you can find some social flats/housing for rent directly from the city for about 80€ the smallest ones, 120-160 bigger flats that can support 2-3 people comfortably. or even parents with 2 children easily. the other thing is, the social housing looks better and is more modern than other types of flats (here in the eastern part of the country at least), usually those buildings are newly constructed within the last decade. all the rest of the flats (privately owned) are 40-60 years old and even more in some cases.  also, I dont understand this part   They are thinking of moving, perhaps to nearby Vienna, where renting is the norm.   what? renting is the norm in Slovakia too. a lot of people rent their places. I would say that 90% of people that moved abroad rent their places back home long-term. there is no problem in finding a place for rent or a place where to live, people just dont have the money for it :) sure its more common in vienna/austra where one guy owns two or three apartments. if I owned multiple apartments, I would have also rented them, huh... no-brainer."
Slovakia,33dekd,grumbal,4,Tue Apr 21 18:23:55 2015 UTC,Renting is the norm in Slovakia too.   It isn't.

Slovakia,33dekd,100k45h,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:52:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think it matters much, whether it's a norm or not. Problem with living in a rent flat is, that owners can decide you need to move out after your contract ends(as lot of people here owning the property usually want to sell it and use the money for buying a new property for themselves) and that can be quite problematic. I don't want to move from flat to flat, it's actually even quite expensive. Also in Bratislava, if you compare how much you'd pay for a rent flat with how much you pay for a mortgage + rent, it's nearly the same value. So it's actually in most cases wiser to just get a mortgage in Bratislava, than rent a flat for 30 years. Not sure about other cities, though."

We have plenty of them in various conditions, from complete ruins to nicely restored fortifications. They tend to be obvious ""landscape makers"". I bet you'll find at least one in every Slovak district.  Also Domašínsky meander is a nice and popular spot above the Váh river near Žilina, with Strečno and Starý hrad castles nearby.   I agree with Súľovské skaly mentioned earlier in this thread, it's a great spot for great pictures.  Are you a hitchhiker, do you have your own car or you'll rely on public transport?"

Slovakia,33cbiq,Wildzooz,4,Tue Apr 21 11:21:49 2015 UTC,"Hi Sennacheribbo,  To continue the trip into SK after the route we discussed to Lednice/Mikulov in CZ, it's hard to choose since there are so many scenic natural places in Slovakia. If I had one week (I assume you are also planning on one week like in CZ), a car and a goal to see some highlights of the countryside and to get off the big highway roads, I would follow this route (just my personal preference of course):  Cross the border from Hodonín (CZ) to Holíč (SK). Skalica is a pretty town a couple of KMs north of Holíč if you want to explore a bit. Head south-east through Senica, then in Jablonica turn south-west and drive towards Bratislava, through Smolenice, Častá, Modra, Pezinok, and Svätý Jur. This route follows along the edge of the Small Carpathian mountains, there are castles and many good hiking trails.   Bratislava is where you will have the best chance to meet other young people (who can speak English), I'm sure you'd want to spend a day there in the old town, and perhaps also drive a few KMs west of the city to Devín where there is a hilltop castle with great views over the Danube River.   Then start going east, the best attractions in the country are mostly in the central and eastern regions.   I would drive straight to Banská Štiavnica (taking the road via Levice and then north) and get there early enough in the day that you have enough time to see everything there (and stay for the night). Take the guided tour through the medieval mine museum (a few KMs south of the town centre) and just before it starts to get dark in the evening climb the hill with the stations of the cross to the red-coloured pilgrimage church at the top, the views are great.    Then go north and stop for an hour or two in Kremnica, before driving north-west to Prievidza to see the fairytale castle of Bojnice (just outside of Prievidza). Then head north on the road towards Žilina and stay for the night in the extremely picturesque folk village of Čičmany (a few KMs west of the main road). Here are some photos of Čičmany.  Then north to Žilina, Strečno castle has very scenic views above the river a few KMs east of the town.   Take the road north-east from Žilina through Terchová and the beautiful scenery of the Malá Fatra national park. Many excellent hiking trails are easily accessible.  Then further north-east to Orava castle above the village of Oravský Podzámok, and then slightly further north to Podbiel, which is a very picturesque village of historic log cottages. From Podbiel take the small road east to Zuberec near the mountains and then south to Liptovský Mikuláš.    This is the Tatra mountain region, and the scenery is good everywhere here. Take the small road north-east through Pribylina, Štrbské Pleso (take a photo of the lake with the mountain peaks behind), and Starý Smokovec. There are excellent mountain hiking trails starting from these towns.   Continue north-east through Tatranská Lomnica, and then north to the village of Ždiar, a pretty place to stay that has a really fun youth hostel to stay in, the Ginger Monkey.    From Ždiar you could cross the border and visit Zakopane and see the Polish side of the mountains before crossing back the same way. From Ždiar I would go south-east to Levoča, one of the best historic towns in SK, and then a few KMs further east to the enormous Spiš castle (above the town of Spišské Podhradie) it's a postcard view you see in all tourist brochures about SK and is a top attraction.  From there I would get a small taste of the 'real east' and drive through Prešov and then north-east to the town of Svidník. A few KMs north-east of Svidník near the Polish border there is a huge World War Two monument, and in the countryside between the monument and Svidník there are beautiful wooden churches in almost every village. There is also the 'Valley of Death' a few KMs north of Svidník where many Soviet Red Army tanks were preserved in the places where they were abandoned in battle, in fields and forests near the side of the road. You can walk around them and stand on the Soviet tanks for a photo.   Then I would drive south directly to Košice, have a good look around its old town square and be sure to climb the tower of the cathedral for the views. There are lots of students in the city so you might want to have a night out in the pubs there.  Then to cross the border into Hungary I would head south-west and see the Aggtelek karst/Slovak karst caves which are on the border, then south to Eger which is a pretty town. There are worthwhile hiking trails in the Bukk hills directly to the east of Eger. Then on to Budapest!  If you're looking for a seven-day Hungary driving itinerary I can make some suggestions, though I know CZ and SK better than HUN. :)"

Slovakia,33cbiq,Wildzooz,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:10:04 2015 UTC,"well, what can I say. I'm speechless. Thank you very much :P I'll need to go through your post again and the only thing I might have to avoid is the first part, as I'll be driving through Wien too. I need to mix castles and landscapes with meeting someone or I'll feel too lonely hehe, I hope a couple of days around Wien help. For Slovakia I'd have a little bit less time, like 5 days counting one for Bratislava.   I also have this doubt, if I enter Hungary from the border north of Eger, will there be customs or something where I can exchange some currency? (same could be applied to entering the czech rep through Strazny)  Yeah, Hungary comes next in the plan so feel free to suggest any possible routes, I really appreciate your time and suggestions, I feel if I drive the way you say I'll really be enjoying the country away from highways and fast ways. I also want to top the daily drives to max 300km. I'll probably start a similar thread in hungary's subreddit in the next days but you can answer here, I'm heading to Romania after and should have max 1 week counting I'll spend 2/3 days in Budapest. I must admit I haven't searched much about Hungary yet, I might drive to the Balaton lake and then back northwast. One idea is to come to Budapest via the slovak side and go back to Romania via Eger-Miskolc-Debrecen and get to see Cluj-Napoca. The other option is just go to Budapest via Miskolc-Eger and then drive south (Pecs or Szeged) and somehow end up in Timisoara. I don't think I can do both... Let me know if you know about more cool hostels! :))"
Slovakia,33cbiq,PavolValovic,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:17:30 2015 UTC,"just went through the whole route again, and appreciate even more your write up, thanks again man, I'll also try to go to Sulovske Skaly, looks gorgeous!"
Slovakia,33cbiq,PavolValovic,2,Wed Apr 29 11:42:00 2015 UTC,"Súľovské Skaly is an interesting place for a hike, though if you were driving north from Čičmany to Žilina there's no way to access it easily without driving on to Žilina, then south-west to Bytča and south to the village of Súľov-Hradná, a bit of a detour off your route but worth it if you've got enough time.  All major border crossings like the one on the main road between Košice and Miskolc will have a currency exchange at the border, but not always at small crossings. If you're concerned about having cash right away when arriving in a rural area in a new country exchange some money ahead of time - so for instance if you want to cross from SK into HUN at a small border crossing, change some Euros into Forint at an exchange in Košice before you leave.   In late June Lake Balaton's southern shore (particularly around Siofok) will be full of young Hungarians who come to drink and party, but there isn't much else to see or do there and personally I would spend the time elsewhere. Pecs is a beautiful town in the south, and Kecskemet and Szeged are also worth stopping in if you take a southern route. From there to the Romanian border Bekescsaba and Gyula are both worth a look as well. The landscape is flat like a pancake in this part of Hungary (all of the south-east), and can be a bit boring to drive through.  While in Budapest I would definitely take a day and drive north to Szentendre - Visegrad - Esztergom and then back, these towns of the Danube Bend are some of the most historic places in Hungary and the river views and forested hills make a great photo backdrop.    My favourite remote and off-the-typical-tourist-path region in Hungary is the far north-east near the border with Ukraine, this region has maintained its traditional culture better than anywhere else in the country and is a good place to experience rural life. You can see lots of wooden historical architecture like windmills, watermills and especially church bell towers, and houses with thatch roofs. The village of Szatmarcseke has unusual wooden grave markers in the cemetery that look like boats.  Miskolc and Debrecen are less interesting in my opinion, I wouldn't specifically plan to spend time in them.   In Romania Cluj is worth half a day to look around, although for me it's mostly just a jumping-off point to reach the Maramures region in the north-west of Romania, a region which is like travelling back in time. Maramures is pretty much the last place in Europe where you can see a rural way of life that hasn't really changed in a century, farmers working in the fields by hand and with horses. Hills and mountains surround villages full of wooden churches and houses, it's all extremely picturesque. The first time I went to Maramures I planned to stay for two days and then stayed for a week.  The north-eastern region of Bukovina is also a fascinating part of Romania, the monasteries in the valleys are painted with colourful frescoes on the outside (rather than on the inside where they would usually be) because in centuries past when armies gathered to fight the Turkish invaders the frescoes were a kind of motivational teaching for the soldiers while they waited and prepared for battle.  The Transylvania region has many highlights, Sibiu, Sighisoara and Brasov are all worth seeing, and there are many beautiful villages and smaller towns like Biertan and Viscri nearby. It's a wonderful region to take the small roads through villages and see daily life. Brasov region is also full of castles and worthwhile mountain hiking trails.  Bucharest isn't particularly beautiful as capital cities go, although after a week in rural Romania it can be nice to experience urban life again. The giant Parliament building, built near the end of the Communist period, is the world's second-largest building and it's worth taking a tour to see the splendour the ruling Ceausescu family enjoyed while average Romanians went hungry.  What's next after that, Bulgaria? :) It would be a shame to come so far and not see Veliko Tarnovo and Plovdiv..."
Slovakia,338ul1,truuy,7,Mon Apr 20 15:59:53 2015 UTC,"No, it was not. Slovak as a separate language developped from Proto-Slavic during the existence of the Kingdom of Hungary, which used Latin as its official language and thus used Latin alphabet (this is probably why Croatian uses Latin alphabet instead of Cyrillic as well).  /u/thekingestkong got it essentially right, but not quite. The Glagolitic alphabet was invented by St. Cyril for the purposes of the mission to Great Moravia, which he led together with his brother Methodius. However, after Methodius died, the ruler of Great Moravia Svätopluk I exiled all of their pupils and followers. Most of them went to Bulgaria, and there they simplified Glagolitic into Cyrillic. Meanwhile the territory of Slovakia was conquered by Hungarians, and thereafter it did not have much cultural interaction with Southern Slavs."
Slovakia,338ul1,ohtarelenion,6,Mon Apr 20 18:52:12 2015 UTC,"Not Slovak as we know it today. First graphic alphabet for Slavic languages was Hlaholic established around 800AD. That was adapted into Cyrillic by Cyril from Solun in 862AD for liturgic purposes in Great Moravia which is considered by some to be the first kingdom of Slovaks. This is highly debated however the language portion and system of writing and its history is widely accepted historical fact.   Someone please correct me if I am wrong, it's been a while since my history class in elementary school.  Edit: used BC in error instead of AD, thanks for pointing it out."
Slovakia,338ul1,thekingestkong,8,Mon Apr 20 16:47:00 2015 UTC,"I'm in no way an expert but I'm pretty sure those years should be AD, not BC. Cyril and Methodius were christian missionaries and I don't think those had any business being around Before Christ (BC)."
Slovakia,338ul1,lowprobability,3,Mon Apr 20 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"Omg, you're totally right, these are AD of course"
Slovakia,338ul1,thekingestkong,2,Mon Apr 20 20:59:09 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but I don't think so. Slovak became a language of its own not too long ago. Standardization was around 16th-17th centuries. Before, I guess, if was all more of bunch dialects. But I remember reading somewhere that Slavs in what is now Slovakia may have used Cyrillics for a little while after Cyril and Methodius came to Moravia. It would make sense too."
Slovakia,338ul1,flamey,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:53:32 2015 UTC,No. Simply because there was no such a thing as Slovak language by the time when Cyrillic emerged.  But there was attempt for using Azbuka.

Slovakia,32vuy1,Neamow,3,Fri Apr 17 11:17:30 2015 UTC,"IMT Smile - Ľudia nie sú zlí   is a fantastic choice. It is one of the bigger bands, but not to much. The lyrics are cleverly written and I think it kind of suits the general mindset of Slovak people. If I had to choose, I would choose this one, because it is far from being stereotypical and even people, who have never heard it find it easy to sing along.   Anything from Elán is too cliché.

Slovakia,32vuy1,Bruncvik,3,Fri Apr 17 13:43:06 2015 UTC,"I may be a little biased, but 80s and 90s pop/rock was my favorite.  Those were my teenage years and prior to the 1989 revolution and for a few years after that, these were ruling the discos and loudspeakers everywhere.  They still evoke summer at the nearest public swimming pool for me.   Elan - Od Tatier k Dunaju Team - Reklama na ticho Robo Grigorov - Bosy a sam Peter Nagy - Aj tak sme stale frajeri Richard Muller - Po schodoch   Since that era, I consider most Slovak popular music to be derivative in style and substance of Western music or covers of older songs (such as the already mentioned Desmond - V Dolinach)."
Slovakia,32vuy1,allischa,3,Fri Apr 17 15:20:33 2015 UTC,I vote for Elán. I'm not a huge fan of patriotism in general but this song makes me feel so proud of my country and its people.
Slovakia,32vuy1,lacomir,3,Fri Apr 17 16:37:08 2015 UTC,"What's really great about these songs to Slovaks is that everyone from those days can relate to them - the lyrics have a real meaning. Unlike in the western world where people come from different religions, economic backgrounds, etc - Slovaks were pretty much all the same during the socialist era. Everyone had similar uobringing, earned the same amount and dressed the same clothes as others.. nobody was 'better' or 'less worthy' - and so pretty much all of the songs from that era reflected the lives of every young person - whether it was about relationships, lifestyle, whatever - the lyrics were great, even when the music itself might sound generic to a non-slovak speaker."
Slovakia,32vuy1,NicoleTheLizard,3,Fri Apr 17 23:07:15 2015 UTC,"Billy Barman - Strmá voda This is actually a really incredible song, musically it's some really nice alternative rock but where it really shines is the lyrics, which are as if taken from a traditional folk ballad, and it blends together beautifully."

Reminded me of Varila Mysicka Kasicku (A little mouse was cooking porridge) where you accompany the rhyme with taking the child's hand and pretend drawing circles on their palm (""stirring a pot""), then you go counting off on their fingers who gets to eat the porridge. ""this one got some, this one got some, this one got some...it ends with finishing the count at the pinky saying ""and this little one didn't get any, so he ran away and hid"" and as you say it, you're supposed to ""run"" with your fingers up the child's arm and end with a tickle session essentially ""poking them."" ... not sure whether it's even remotely related but that's what it (the actions, not the words) reminded me of.

Slovakia,31ats0,bajaja,2,Fri Apr 3 12:38:02 2015 UTC,"Hi, well my mother, of Polish ancestry, recited the poem to us when being put to bed...so it's not just a Slovak custom.  As she said the words, she would draw the circle on our back....""color"" it in with ""purple"" and back rub and then end with a light poke with one of her fingers.  She would then show all her fingers and you would try to guess the poking culprit.  This would repeat until you guessed correctly...sometimes trying ti guess wrong so you could another back rub. When i had children we added different colors in the rhyme...just for fun...and may have sometimes used a toe, or the dogs paw or other silly things just for fun.  It was all just part of the bedtime ritual, along with prayers a ""blessing"" everyone you could think of, just to stay up a little longer.

Central and Eastern Europe of article  Easter customs:       Many central and eastern European ethnic groups, including the Albanians, Armenians, Belarusians, Bulgarians, Croats, Czechs, Georgians, Germans, Hungarians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Macedonians, Poles, Romanians, Russians, Serbs, Slovaks, Slovenes, and Ukrainians decorate eggs for Easter.  In Bulgaria the Easter eggs are decorated on Thursday before Easter or at Saturday before Easter. Widespread tradition is to fight with eggs by pair and one's egg become last surviving is called borak (Bulgarian: борак, fighter). The tradition is to display the decorated eggs on the Easter table together with the Easter dinner consisting of roasted lamb, a salad called Easter salad (lettuce with cucumbers) and a sweet bread called kozunak.  In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, a tradition of spanking or whipping is carried out on Easter Monday. In the morning, men spank women with a special handmade whip called a pomlázka (in Czech) or korbáč (in Slovak), in eastern regions of former Czechoslovakia Moravia and Slovakia they also throw cold water on them. The pomlázka/korbáč consists of eight, twelve or even twenty-four withies (willow rods), is usually from half a meter to two meters long and decorated with coloured ribbons at the end. The spanking may be painful, but it's not intended to cause suffering. A legend says that women should be spanked with a whip in order to keep their health, beauty and fertility during the whole next year.

Slovakia,30lyg8,bajaja,2,Thu Apr 2 11:15:47 2015 UTC,"ok. what I was told as a kid (in Bratislava, a melting pot of Slovak traditions):   beating is in remembrance of the early Christians beaten by Roman soldiers at some occasion perfume must be something at least 100 years old as my grandma forced us to do it herself, so for the generation born before 1900 it must have been normal. my uneducated guess is that perfume must have been a luxury at the time. and perhaps used as such - in small amount.   I can see how this is terrible and barbaric for a visitor of Slovakia. I personally avoid this shit in fear of overdoing it (after couple episodes 20 years ago) and girls not liking it in general (unless they're very young and love any attention). it is OK in reasonable amount between close family or perhaps some villages.  thinking about it, you haven't ask what's with Easter Monday and alcohol...

The surrounding nature is spectacular though, if you're the kind of person who is into the great outdoors, hiking, mountain biking, etc. you'll have a great time. If you're the kind of person who likes the fast pace of city life and having lots of other English speaking people around to socialize with you may find it less appealing. PB is on the main railway line across the country and near a main railway line into the Czech Republic, so it's easy enough to travel in the region and in neighbouring countries if you want to go explore Central Europe. You can get to Bratislava by train in just over two hours, to the alpine peaks of the Tatra mountains in 2.5 hours, to Prague in 4 hours 40 minutes and to Vienna in about 3.5 hours. You could visit any of those places for a weekend, and even Budapest and Krakow would be possible for a long weekend. There are many excellent castles to visit in the region around PB, and traditional folk culture is still quite strong in the surrounding villages. The local food is hearty and heavy, lots of meat, potatoes and soups. Have you lived abroad before? PB might be a challenging place for a first experience abroad, but with the right attitude and interests it could be an interesting place to try."
Slovakia,309flv,Wildzooz,1 point,Thu Mar 26 06:40:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the extensive reply! I'm a little bummed that this is where I was placed considering I am more interested in city life, even if I do love hiking and mountain biking a lot. I lived in London before as my only other time spent abroad which obviously wasn't the most difficult transition from the US. I really want to try to make this work as it is a rare opportunity, but do you think it is easy enough to travel to nearby university towns? I'm just a bit worried about feeling isolated due to speaking only English."
Slovakia,309flv,Wildzooz,3,Thu Mar 26 14:20:28 2015 UTC,"Žilina is 30 minutes from PB by train, both are on the main line so there are trains all the time through the day (about one per hour). It's one of the bigger towns in Slovakia (about 85,000 population) but still feels very provincial. Trenčín is 40 minutes by train, about one train per hour. It's a town of about 55,000 with a nice castle and a historic town centre. Bratislava is the nearest place that will feel cosmopolitan with significant numbers of foreigners around, and for a truly international city Vienna is another hour by train from there. Use this transport website to check all train and bus times and distances in Slovakia and the Czech Republic (if it doesn't appear in English you can change to English by clicking on the flag in the lower right corner).   Personal safety isn't something you should worry about, Slovakia in general is a very safe place, I feel much safer walking around at night in Slovak towns and cities than I do in North America (I'm from Canada).  I lived in two small towns in central Slovakia (Liptovský Mikuláš and Poprad) for about two years and in the capital Bratislava for four years. I arrived in Poprad without knowing any of the language, and it was difficult socially for the first few months as there was only one other English speaking foreigner in the town. I eventually befriended locals who took me hiking and introduced me to their culture and their country. Young people in small towns will usually speak enough English to communicate on a basic level, some can speak very well though this is much more likely in the capital Bratislava than in the countryside. In a small town you will need to start making an effort to learn some of the language right away, you'll need to use it on a daily basis (shopping, etc.), but for most foreigners it takes many years of effort to reach a level where you can feel competent in using the language (Slavic languages are much more difficult than west European languages like French or Spanish). I eventually moved to Bratislava where there is a large English-speaking expatriate community and English is much more prevalent among locals. That said, looking back I preferred living in the small towns as it was a more authentic experience culturally (spending time with locals rather than other foreigners), closer to nature and the mountains, and I learned to speak Slovak (and Czech), which I probably wouldn't have done if I'd only been in the capital Bratislava.  What will the Fulbright posting involve, and what arrangements for accommodation will be made for you? The bureaucracy required to get your visa permit and residency documents processed is complex but I assume you will have a local to help you with it all."
Slovakia,309flv,Wildzooz,1 point,Fri Mar 27 01:51:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you again for taking the time to provide me with so much information, it's really a huge help! The transport website is incredibly useful and for some reason Google maps decided to leave out all public transit and show me one bus as the only way to get anywhere lol. For Fulbright I'll be teaching English at the high school in town, so I'll be in communication soon with the headmaster there. Hopefully there is a decent English department with other teachers who could help me figure things out in town. I emailed the head of the my program to ask about housing accommodations, since I am curious as to if there is the possibility of me just commuting from a nearby city (like Zilina). I'm working so few hours a week (15-18 is the average for Fulbright) that I'd prefer to commute..but of course I'm sure they have restrictions on where they can let you run off to if its a government funded program. I'm still trying to wrap my head around what in my essays gave off the impression that I wanted to be in a small town! haha. I really do love the idea of being surrounded by nature, but I know that I personally am someone who gets anxious with little social interaction. I'm hoping they don't see me as coming off as ungrateful by emailing them so soon with my concerns, but it is a year of my life and I want to make sure I make the best decision for me!"
Slovakia,309flv,Wildzooz,3,Fri Mar 27 02:11:23 2015 UTC,"Public transport in Slovakia and other central European countries is among the most comprehensive and convenient in the world, and for a price that is extremely cheap by North American standards. You can get to even the most remote villages by train or bus, and they almost always run on time.  I taught English for a private language school in those small towns for two years, for most of that time I was the only native speaker on staff. The local teaching staff were the first people I had to socialize with, though many of them were older and had their own lives and families. Most of the friends I made were adult students in the courses, I didn't have any classes with kids. 15 to 18 hours per week must mean the teaching load (time actually in the classroom), which is typical for that kind of posting. You'll need to spend another 15 to 18 hours per week preparing the lessons and doing administrative tasks in the school, so you'll need to be there from Monday to Friday for the full school day. Do you have any previous experience with teaching English and with teaching English grammar specifically? I'm not sure if they'll want you to do mostly conversational activites with the kids or grammar lessons (the local teachers might do most of that), probably a mix of both.   Most likely the high school in PB will arrange accommodation for you within walking distance of the school (everything is within walking distance in PB). Be prepared for the fact that the quality of accommodation can vary dramatically in a small town like that, they may give you an apartment in a building from the communist era that has changed little since those days, or you might get an apartment that has been fully renovated with new Ikea furniture, modern windows, doors, flooring, carpets, etc. Anything they give you will be clean and well-heated, buildings are often over-heated in the winter. They might allow you to make arrangements to live in a different town like Žilina in accommodation you found yourself, but you would find it extremely difficult to view apartments and sign contracts with landlords there without knowing the language/culture. Landlords (especially in small towns) can also be reluctant to rent to foreigners since they feel uncomfortable about trusting their properties to people they can't communicate with fully.  I assume the posting is for a calendar school year from September to June. The winters (November to March) can be cold and grey in a small town with few entertainment options, but April to October is a wonderful time to get out in the great outdoors. To enjoy the winters you'd have to really love the job and working with the kids in the school, to make that your main reason for wanting to be there."
Slovakia,309flv,koalauser,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:11:43 2015 UTC,"I have experience in TEFL; I taught in London for a few months and then NYC for another few. I'm not super experienced, but I am familiar with it which is more than most Fulbright students. I also taught at the public school level and have a Master's in Education so I do have a background in some things that are universally helpful (like classroom management.) When I was in NYC I was teaching 20 hours a week. Also, I just got an email from the head of the Fulbright Commission in the Slovak Republic and apparently the school will help me find accommodations but I am allowed to live in whatever town I so choose. Hopefully if I'm in contact early enough I can figure out a way to land something in a nearby university town with the help of the head master or someone else at the school. I'd really like to have my home base be somewhere I can go out at night and meet people without having to rely on commuting outside of the town itself."
Slovakia,309flv,koalauser,2,Fri Mar 27 15:53:20 2015 UTC,"Žilina is the best option then for a place to look. It's big enough to have a bit of life to it on Friday and Saturday nights and has a university student vibe during the school year. A huge factory producing Kia cars for the European market is just outside the town so there are South Korean managers who live in Žilina, not many other foreigners apart from a few exchange students at the university. It's also the closest large urban centre to PB at just 30 minutes by train, that would be a fairly easy daily commute and inexpensive. To begin getting a feel for what's happening in Slovakia you can read the English-language newspaper The Slovak Spectator. It's rather Bratislava-focused but has lots of articles on cultural events and things to see and do written by expats and locals living in Slovakia."
Slovakia,304hqd,Lolkac,7,Tue Mar 24 12:25:03 2015 UTC,"no shit sherlock!   the prices are high - som ski resorts pushed their prices higher because of low demand, or have a deal with other ski resorts not to lower prices.

Slovakia,2zt8ol,bajaja,2,Sat Mar 28 23:16:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, you need to try it, it's delicious! :) Here's the recipe for sauce, I usually use it for one big eggplant but adjust it as you like, just keep the ratio :   1 tbsp soy sauce 1 teasp fish sauce (optional, change for soy sauce if don't use fish one) chili flakes (use as you like, about 1 teasp) 2 teasp sesame oil sesame seeds about 2 cloves of garlic 1-2 green onions   Combine all sauce ingredients except sesame seeds. Then steam the eggplant but don't cut it too much (this is how it should be done if you want to make it authentic, but works fine if you just pan-fry it). Now just tear up your steamed eggplant into 3-4cm strips, put them in the sauce and mix well. If you pan-fry it then obviously you have small pieces already. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top and you're done.  I found for me personally that garlic is too heavy here. Even though I like it my stomach does not agree so I had to exclude it and just add more chili flakes. Still pretty tasty.  And yes, I just love exotic food, especially from South and East Asia. Since I'm vegetarian these cuisines suits me really well because I can just pick from all of those side dishes and they have many meatless options. I just learn recipes from the almighty internet (youtube especially)"

Slovakia,2ybse5,Demolitarian,8,Sun Mar 8 10:36:31 2015 UTC,This is so cool. We only get to hear about Hungarian minorities in Slovakia and almost never about Slovak minorities in Hungary. How is it there? It looks beautiful. Do people speak Slovak often there? Do you consider learning Slovak sometime in the future? Do Hungarians treat Slovak and other minorities fairly? I wish our two nations could finally settle our differences and live peacefully. Our politicians harass the Hungarian minorities all the time and it makes me sad. I hope that Hungarians treat their minorities fairly nowadays.
Slovakia,2ybse5,eccolus,8,Sun Mar 8 14:53:00 2015 UTC,Our politicians harass all citizens indiscriminately. Let's give them credit where it's due.
Slovakia,2ybse5,allischa,6,Sun Mar 8 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"As an ethnic Hungarian, this is how I, too, see it. Blind nationalism on both sides prevents us from realizing that we're all in this together. Instead of focusing on the common enemy, they pick fights with each other. Politicians love to fuel these sentiments because it gives them an advantage when they fuck us over. It's easier to mess with two or more divided crowds than a huge united one."
Slovakia,2ybse5,bajaja,3,Sun Mar 8 16:46:51 2015 UTC,"Great questions!  So the town was originally a Hungarian town but was destroyed by the Ottomans. It was resettled by mostly Lutheran families from Slovakia in the 18th century. The Slovaks here and in the neighbouring villages are their descendants.   Well, the langauge is disappearing very quickly unfortunately. Békéscsaba had been a Slovak town for centuries, but there were two major disasters in the life of the town. First was Trianon, when thousands of Hungarian refugees fled the now Romanian Transylvania and settled in Békéscsaba, changing the demographics of the town significantly. However this was the lesser  problem, the bigger came in 1945-1950. Agitators came from Slovakia and tried to persude the ethnic Slovaks here to move to the newly-founded independent Slovakia to replace the Hungarians who were expelled from the country. 5500 Slovaks, including many of my relatives left Békéscsaba, so the town became a Hungarian-majority town for the first time in centuries.  Currently only 6% of the population consider themselves Slovakian (around 4000 of the 60.000), but it's a bit misleading. If you really want to get an idea about the number of Slovaks in Békéscsaba, it's better to check the religions. As I said, the town was settled by Lutherans and Békéscsaba is still the largest Lutheran town in the country (and we have the largest Lutheran church in Central Europe). According to the latest data, there are around 17.000 Catholics (half of them are Hungarian, half of them are Slovaks), 14.000 Lutherans (mostly Slovaks), 7500 Calvinists (mostly Hungarians). So around 22.000 people are of Slovakian ancestry of the 60.000. Even more, if we count the non-religious people.   I do not speak the language, but my recently passed grandmother did and my grandfather's mother tounge was indeed Slovakian. I also own a family Bible from the late 1800s written in archaic Slovakian. Many elders still speak the language to some degree, it's not uncommon to hear them on Wednesday and Saturday at the local marketplace. However, it was actually that generation who fucked this up pretty hard, as they used a language to talk about things they didn't want their children to hear. This was so common that within 30 years the langauge almost died out. Nowadays very few young people speak Slovakian, but when they do, they use what they learnt at minority schools (=standard Slovak), which is pretty different from the archaic Slovak of the town.   However, you can still listen to this archaic language if you go to the nearby villages where it's still the everyday language more or less (especially in the local kocsma) in Kardoš (Kardos) and Slovenský Komlóš (Tótkomlós), even though young people prefer Hungarian.  TLDR: Slovaks are here, but disappearing.   EDIT: Oh, here is an interview with two Slovaks of Békéscsaba, it's mostly in Hungarian, but there are a lot of Slovakian in it, so maybe it will be of some interest to you."
Slovakia,2ycmfc,Pursuit_of_Hoppiness,5,Sun Mar 8 17:10:16 2015 UTC,"It depends on your interests, fitness and amount of time you are willing to spend on Slovakia and where you'll stay.  A ""Classic"" Slovak holiday consists of hiking and visiting castles, but there's more.  Hiking: in April, there is still snow on the highest peaks and even in lower parts, some hiking trails especially in national parks are closed due to nature protection. Expect a lot of mud, sometimes mixed with snow. My personal favorite: Janošíkové Diery in National Park Malá Fatra. It's a system of gorges and waterfalls, hiking is not difficult much and nearby villages Terchová, Štefanová or Zázrivá offer traditional Slovak cuisine, cheese (don't miss korbáčiky from Zázrivá). For other tips, consult hiking.sk (only available in Slovak, sorry).  Castles: Bojnický zámok with a ZOO is a popular destination for families with kids. Oravský hrad offers impressive view. Spišský hrad is one of the biggest in Central Europe. It's hard to choose one...  Then there's ""more"".  For example, if you like good wine, go to ""Slovak National Collection of Wine"" in Pezinok or Bratislava (I heard Pezinok is better) and order a degustation menu (open degustation menu costs about 22 EUR, IIRC).  If you are into recent history, go visit Museum of Slovak National Uprising in Banská Bystrica, or even better, the open-air Memorial in Dukla (east Slovakia).  Oh, by the way, if all you want is just spend a lazy weekend somewhere, go to ""Slovak Tuscany"", the hilly landscape with scattered houses (kopanice) around town Myjava. You can take walks, long or short, ride a bike or even a horse. Eat and sleep in soon to become legendary Restaurant and Pension U Juhása. It opens in April, after a winter break. Warning, reservation required, meals served only during weekend.  Regarding Bratislava, here is a map of interesting places of all kinds."

Then there is Gabcikovo for example. But these are mostly places where you don't really spend your whole day at. If you want to see some beautiful towns/cities besides Bratislava, definitely check out some of these: Piestany, Nitra, Trencin, Bojnice, Kremnica, Banska Stiavnica, Banska Bystrica, Kosice."

I suppose I could go to Slovakia, renounce my US citizenship at the embassy and go stateless, and then see if the Slovak govt will be happy to accept as a citizen a stateless person who didn't flee war...  but more to your point about Hungarian Slovaks, when laws are used to isolate and punish a segment of your society, it moves your society away from the ideals that are meant to unify the EU on a modern and enlightened path."

Slovakia,2x5lxd,thekingestkong,2,Wed Feb 25 21:11:51 2015 UTC,"So, I'm useless - I can't answer bits specific to Slovakia, but I can answer the nerdy bits;  It will work, but only on a single channel - 2100MHz.  What this means, is you'll get 3g in & around cities, but because you don't have the 900MHz band, you'll get pretty poor (if at all) reception outside of cities.  Additionally, no LTE at all.  (It exists, but not on the same bands this device covers).  If you want to look at other devices, look for their manuals (or specifications) and look for:   3G/UTMS frequencies - 950+2100.  One will work, both is better. LTE bands: 3,7,20.  Just 20 will work, more is better, without these you'll get 3g but no LTE.   It is as messy as it sounds.  phones around the world don't all use the same bands.  The more bands your phone has in common with where you're travelling, the better it'll work out.  (I can't really suggest any device in particular because I sold my soul to apple, so I'm completely out-of-date on what options are available to you)"

If it's a state owned company, it will be disaster. Practically anything that is owned by state have disastrous customer services & have very ineffective reclamation routines.. You can even say they are annoyed that you dare to demand  service you paid for, right? As far as I'm concerned, they will most likely do nothing for 30 days (reclamation time). Either it finally arrives, or not. After that, they will offere some form of a refund, which can be inadequate to the price of item. I don't believe there is anything you can do.

One thing you should be aware of is that, in general, salaries and the likes are much lower than in the US, Canada, or Western Europe in general. The cost of living is lower (though Bratislava is the most expensive part of Slovakia), but I would not say it is proportional to the decrease in wages.   I can't speak to the job prospects you'd have as a designer (unless you could take long distance clients from other countries and charge  accordingly), but Western Slovakia is where you'll most likely find employment.   Finally, coming from the US, you'd be pretty surprised about the general bureaucracy and its lack of efficiency in Slovakia; but I must admit it may be different from my experiences in the North-East."

If you have more serious problem, like you sue someone, it may even take a decade to get some statement from the court (eg. someone build something on your land without permission and/or building permit. Yup, no one cares) .  Language may be also an issue. Since we were part of CCCP under USSR's sphere of influence, older and middle generation basically don't speak English at all.

We got all our paperwork handed in at the end of August, and by the time we got back from our vacation in the first week of October, we were called to come pickup my ID card. As long as you pay attention to the paperwork you fill out and have a legitimate reason for coming to SK, it's rather easy. I read a man who tried to bring his wife here had to send her back home because they screwed up in a few places in the paperwork and had to restart, so don't make any mistakes if you are working towards a permit."

Geniuses at police department reduced the number of officers working for alien bureau and it completely nuked the process, people had to come at 3am just to manage to squeeze into the line.  After ministry received a ton of complains and major media channels took notice and bombed them about it, they increased the number of staffers in department and increased working hours and it should be fine now.

Any major city in the states is hell for government paperwork, let alone on a national scale (Passport waiting time is 4 - 6 weeks? Why not wait 16). Still though, I had no clue about that. In Žilina, we got there about 9AM and were out before 11. They had 3 people doing the applications, and each person took about 30 minutes, so it wasn't too bad, but that wasn't in the capitals district either."

You won't have any problem getting a job at IBM, I know Lenovo have a hiring freeze in place at the moment, but the employment agencies are the best place to start, just contact them now and see what the jobs are like. Everything's extremely cheap compared to the UK and US, I don't understand why everyone's telling you BA is expensive. It is compared to the rest of Slovakia, but not when you factor in Western prices. Be prepared for a big wage cut, though. Finally, you're going to need a Slovak speaker to help you with the officials and they're not the friendliest, but I had no major problems dealing with them.

Expect that to be your biggest worry for 3 months and at the very least be sure you have an employer ready to help you all along the way through that process before you come here. Your backup option is to bounce around here and places like Ukraine till you figure out a residency situation.   I took the marriage route, and still got deported despite being married to a Slovak national due to a miscalculation in my time that put me about a day and half over my VISA from the date my paperwork was suppose to be finished.

If you're web / UI designer and work from home, doesn't matter where you live and you can probably earn same money from anywhere when you have the right connections.  I work for tiny US company, which has office in Kosice and I'm pretty sure our salaries are much lower than our US friends, altho still much higher than Slovak average.  If you can't speak the language, you'll have many issues with everything, unless you already have some friends who can help you. Ukrainian is a bit similar, but I'm pretty sure that ""fundamentals of Ukrainian"" won't help you at all.  If you really want to move here, look for free Slovak courses (International organization for migration provides them in Bratislava) and think hard if you're willing to move to lower living standard than US, worse services and government/state care.  On the other hand, some things are pretty cheap here, but no in Bratislava. That city is so goddamn expensive (and ugly), Prague is much cheaper. Bratislava is the single worst city you can live in in Slovakia. You have tons of job opportunities, Vienna is close, Prague is close, many flights everywhere to EU, but the city itself is just terrible. I really don't know anyone who likes that city. I know many people who moved there for their jobs and prefer working there because of higher salaries and many job opportunities, but the city is very ugly."

On top of that, we could live off one salary alone and still save. Compared to a lot of EU in general, Bratislava is super cheap. In fact, we pay less for a lot in grocery stores for example than we do when visiting and spending time with my mother-in-law in Liptovský Mikuláš.  As for the language barrier, I disagree with that too. I've had zero problems since the first time I came here in 2012. Sure, there is a bit of a hassle with the old generation, but a lot of places are hiring English speakers. I went to the Aupark Nay two weeks ago and had no problem getting help in English. It's only small places you'll have any issue, and even then, a lot of times they have younger employees you'll be able to work with. It may be different in smaller areas, but even in LM, I didn't have many issues.  Are you from the US or are you from SK?"
Slovakia,2vdq0d,sklb,3,Tue Feb 10 21:02:09 2015 UTC,"I'm native SK and I stand by what I said - Bratislava, not even compared to the rest of Slovakia, but compared to Prague, Budapest, it is very expensive, even comparable to Vienna (I'm talking about food/services/shopping).  If you earn enough, you can even live in Scandinavia and say it's not that expensive. Average monthly wage is about 840€ in Slovakia. Before tax.  As for English speakers - as I said, if you already have some friends (or English speakers as you put it), who can help you, you'll have it much easier. For example I simply can't imagine being successful in bureaus speaking English only."

Slovakia,2vdq0d,bratislava,1 point,Tue Feb 10 13:25:36 2015 UTC,"go to austria or prague. better work market, slovakian employers would rip you off on salary, even in large companies its standard practice. keep in mind here noone advertises what salary the job offers, so you can go to 3 circles of hell i mean interviews only to find out the job is offering joke wage. keep in mind that being foreigner might be an issue in finding a job, as they would assume you would be too expensive. my cousin who had mba from stanford was blocked by slovakian HR from being hired by a us company, and that company is actually having no problems paying nice salaries. so it was clearly a fear of hiring someone the american owners might promote in future.  also slovakia is a small market, you would have it really hard to find job as designer here. maybe you could, maybe you wouldnt. depends on how much of savings you have till you get established, but without connections that could take long  now if you were to do teleworking for western companies, then yes, but again real estate in slovakia is closing in on vienna prices so your living costs would be high.   people are always gloomy looking, are jealous of each other. honestly dont come here.   tough austria is probably better decision than germany. and you could come to bratislava on a weekend trip to check it out. prague would be also great as there are good options for good work as most us companies are there and its large city with a lot of new construction as the city is not constrained by space like bratislava is."

Find a company, figure out what language (Most likely Java), learn the language, and have a job. Having a degree isn't as much of a priority to companies here as is being competent and knowing your way around. If you can do the job and show competency, they'll most likely hire you, regardless of education."

Slovakia,2vdq0d,jerko14,1 point,Thu Feb 26 09:22:30 2015 UTC,"I would strongly discourage you from moving to Bratislava. I was born in Bratislava and I have also lived in Vienna and a couple of other Western European cities. Bratislava is a nice town, but there's nothing that makes Bratislava preferable over Western Europe... except the beautiful women. 99% of the foreigners who move to Slovakia from Western Europe are young men who fell in love with a beautiful Slovak woman. You already have a wife, so there's literally no reason for you to move to Slovakia. Come here as a tourist, but don't move here.  People on this thread who are saying that Bratislava is super cheap are wrong. These people obviously have high-paying jobs, and those jobs are rare. Even though Bratislava is the richest part of Slovakia, the standards of living in Bratislava are significantly lower than in Western Europe and there are less job opportunities. Bratislava and Vienna are just 40 miles from each other, but the difference in living standards is very significant. It's like a middle class suburb in the Midwest vs a small town in rural Alabama.  As a native speaker of English, you can teach English, but that's pretty much it. You could also find a job at an international company. You'd be doing mind-numbing work (outsourced from the US or the UK) for €750-€900 per month after taxes. However, those kind of jobs are currently being outsourced from Eastern Europe to India. International companies in Slovakia are mostly looking for people who speak German, French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish. English alone won't get you anywhere, it's just a prerequisite for getting a job. The fact that you're a native speaker won't give you a leg up at those companies.   You say you ""could probably do anything if I really wanted to."" You could do a lot of things in Slovakia, but you'd be competing in a small and relatively poor market against people who are native speakers. You'd have to speak perfect Slovak first. I'm not saying it's not doable, but why take the most difficult road? If you want to move to Europe, move to Germany. It's a big and rich country and Germans speak English very well."

Keby referendum prešlo, tak by sa homosexuáli nemohli brať/adoptovať deti. Prečo? Definícia manželstva už je v ústave a ústava je najsilnejším zákonom na Slovensku. Ak sa Chromík chcel dozvedieť, čo si ľudia myslia o homosexuálnych manželstvách stačilo spraviť prieskum. Ten by bol pravdepodobne presnejší, lebo o tých 80%, čo sa nezúčastnilo, by sme vedeli, či sú za homomanželstvá, alebo či ich to nezaujíma."

Slovakia,2v4igc,Thisredditname,5,Sat Feb 7 20:54:02 2015 UTC,"It depends where you will stay, so you won't spend another whole day just to reach the mountains.  The list of best mountains for hiking according to myself (order not significant):   High Tatras (Vysoké Tatry): highest, a bit over 2500m high, alpine terrain, subject to sudden changes in weather West Tatras (Západné Tatry - Roháče): the west part of Tatra mountain range, a bit lower (about 2000m), nice green peaks Low Tatras (Nízke Tatry): similar to West Tatras, more popular, more developed Little Fatra (Malá Fatra): my personal favorite, not far from Bratislava, offers nice scenery with gorges and waterfalls (Jánošíkové diery) and nice peaks too (e.g. Veľký Rozsutec). Slovak Paradise (Slovenský Raj): best georges, canyons, waterfalls etc. Very popular and crowded during high season. I recommend Sokolia dolina, it's beautiful and less ""spoiled"" than other, more popular hikes. Bukovské vrchy: on ""far east"", remote but mostly unspoiled, plenty of wild animals live there, including bears, wolves and an European Bison.   A search of this subreddit will reveal more.  Finally, no post about hiking in Slovakia should omit the fantastic hiking.sk website (unfortunately in Slovak only, but Google Translate is always your friend) with the most accurate hiking online map available."

Slovakia,2v4igc,meh_whateva,3,Sun Feb 8 14:11:47 2015 UTC,Well if you are going to High Tatras its easy just go to Hrebienok and from there anywhere... there is a lot of maps and everything and ofcourse how much time it will take you. But I am not sure if it is possible in february...
Slovakia,2v4igc,wosmo,3,Sat Feb 7 22:51:19 2015 UTC,"I walked Ďumbier and Chopok this summer, and from that would recommend that the low-tatras aren't to be sniffed at either.  The high tatra lean more towards alpine - the low tatra are still higher than anything in my country!  I fear May could be a little early, however.  Chopok is part of a ski resort (Jasná) during the winter, and they close their ski season April 30th - so I can easily imagine that May could be neither good skiing, nor good walking!  It really is a great country for it though.  I found plenty of maps, signs, well-marked trails, and plenty of friendly locals rightfully enjoying the countryside.  (but I will say, go for paper maps where you can find them.  garmin don't seem to do trails in slovakia too well, you have to go buy a whole extra pack just for slovakia because they've handed it off to a third-party)"

Especially for a referendum which will not even reach 50% participation (im not saying its not possible but last presidentia elections had 46% participation so..). Anyway it's also a shame for me and alot of people I know, seeing as all of the western world is moving towards tolerance and Slovakia is moving towards Saudi Arabia-style government (where laws are written not with logic but according to a old and ""holy"" book). What is sad is that his situation deepens (and many other young people who should be the future of Slovakia) my desire to leave this country, because even government is in the end about public opinion which is catasthropical and manipulated by media and the catholic church as it seems..."

We're part of the NATO and we have a professional army.   As for the act of refusing military service, I read the prescription because of this and it's true that men aged 19 years and older, capable of performing military duties can refuse to do so during times of peace. Every year, until the end of January. In which case, if the state declares an emergency, they don't have to take part in combat, only perform duties of other character. Until the prescription is changed, or the proclamation retracted, this is valid for life.  If they don't, and, let's say, an emergency is declared, they can no longer refuse whatever duty they are assigned."

Slovakia,2syc6h,kesuaus,1 point,Tue Jan 20 19:05:09 2015 UTC,"I think it is hard to define exactly, but the state sector is in itself inefficient and produces a lot of government waste when it comes to procurement which decreases the total pool of money for redistribution in these institutions.  The other thing is that the salaries are based on tables, so there is no real incentive to perform better, which means that state institutions tend to under perform.  There is usually no personal responsibility for screwing up (like helping a friend in a procurement competition, can't remember the exact word). Which coupled with the low salaries means you either have lazy or corrupted people in such institutions (there are exceptions).  To be honest I think that most of this reasons stem from socialism since back then everyone was a state employee, had to have a job and everyone had equally low salaries. Most people therefore didn't put much effort into their work while others stole and cheated so that they can have a better life - there was a joke motto back then ""The one not stealing from the state steals from his family"", again there were exceptions.  Also remember that lower paying positions tend to attract worse employees."
Slovakia,2syc6h,kesuaus,2,Wed Jan 21 07:35:37 2015 UTC,"Hi! 1. as other people mentioned, try talking to young people, especially those who seem to be students! They might be confused at first, but you have much greater chance of getting help or info from them :) To your lost wallet - I am very sorry to tell you that it might not get lost but stolen...I would not be surprised. So always have it somewhere safe, if you have a backpack, make sure your wallet and other expensive things are down at the bottom!   This winter is especially warm. But there is still some chance that snow will come. It probably depends on where you are, when you go out, etc. During the day, most people are at work, at school. And I guess, the reason your offered is true as well! Bread, for example, is one of the most basic meals - everyone buys bread. Maybe that's why it seems so cheap to you. I don't know whether it's so traditional to eat bread in Taiwan. However, as somebody else mentioned, the prices in Slovakia are not SO low as they should be, compared to other countries and their standard of living. Thank you! :)"

Anyway we don't even have laws that allow this so it's pointless referendum."

Slovakia,2srs6a,UrielSVK,11,Sun Jan 18 04:23:11 2015 UTC,"That is nothing but a religious point of view. Religion should be left out of public matters.  Any home is better than no home for an unwanted, abandoned or orphaned child. No. They should not. Sexual education is just as important as any other subject, if not more. What's next? They're gonna be able to opt them out of science class and explain all natural phenomena as Acts of God? Cancel the stupid religious studies instead and let them take their kids to Sunday school at church if they want to. BTW, what sex ed classes are they talking about? It's been a while since I quit teaching but five years ago there was no sex ed whatsoever."
Slovakia,2srs6a,allischa,5,Sat Jan 17 22:22:09 2015 UTC,"Mariage is currently limited to a union of man and woman - its even in constitution - question changes nothing The way adoptions currently work, homosexual couple can not adopt a child, only married couple, husban/wife of a parent of child or someone who is single can. There is no way for an unmaried couple to adopt a child - question changes nothing Maybe only question that can change something, even if i dont know how - sexual education is not tought separatelly, but can be taught as a part of some other subjects. Should the child be opted out of these subjects? Should it be sent out of class when somethig that can be considered sexual education is taught?   So basically this referendum, even if it will be succesfull, wont result in any change."

Slovakia,2srs6a,allischa,3,Mon Jan 19 10:00:26 2015 UTC,"Regarding question number one - I always remember one quote I read and agree with: ""When everything becomes marriage, marriage becomes nothing."" I, for one, believe marriage as an institution deserves to have a unique position. Once you relativize the importance or broaden the definition of marriage, it has an impact on the perception of what family actually is, thus it influences the whole society in the long run."
Slovakia,2srs6a,peepay,5,Mon Jan 19 08:46:41 2015 UTC,"thus it influences the whole society in the long run   Of course it does. I guess what you meant to say was ""it's bad for society"" and that's where we disagree. Your perception of marriage seems to be the biblical bond between a man and a woman. I guess it was clear enough from my comment where I think people can shove the bible. To me, marriage is a legal contract between two individuals who want to share assets and rely on the other one in case of being incapable of making important life decisions. Nothing more and nothing less. As for what non biological family is, well, the same applies: people you choose to include in your life. Could be two people, could be thirty. Something is wrong with the world where people think they can dictate who others are allowed to call family."
Slovakia,2srs6a,UrielSVK,-2,Mon Jan 19 09:56:12 2015 UTC,"So you have no problem with a place where any bond of any people can be called ""marriage"" and the real marriage that is crucial for society, for real (biological) family and for raising children in the best possible environment, is relativized, replaced for anything else, and stomped on? In that case, you are just shortsighted. The results could be detrimental."
Slovakia,2srs6a,allischa,9,Mon Jan 19 10:44:34 2015 UTC,"Mariage is not crucial for society. Family might be, but marriage is not. And family does not mean a married couple with children. Family is just a social group - parents and children. They can be married, but they dont have to be.  And yes, even i believe its best for a child to have a loving caring biological parents, but sometimes it is not possible. What then? Let the child rot in orphanage and kick him out when hes 18?"

Slovakia,2srs6a,bajaja,3,Mon Jan 19 10:59:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not avoiding an answer. I made it clear from the beginning. Religious people and their traditional views are a plague and a poison to the world. None of the articles you listed talk about any of those proposals and their impact on society in the long run. They are simply the views of a couple of people on what they think is better for children. I have nothing to talk to you about. I think you're delusional. Thousands of years old artificially coined traditional values that mean nothing have been embedded and engraved into your brain and you refuse to let go of them. No logic, no rationale, no evidence involved. Just because something has been enforced and promoted by a lot of people for a long time, it doesn't mean it's the only way, let alone the right way to go. I would really appreciate if you left me alone with your irrational conformist BS. There is no point for you to try and change my view, because it won't happen.

Slovakia,2srs6a,peepay,3,Mon Jan 19 12:05:52 2015 UTC,"LOL again. You don't get it, right? What do you even mean by ""false""? Is it just a mistranslation or are you implying that I'm a liar? The only thing that supports your view is that you are in the majority (for now anyway ;-p). Because the way you feel about things is the way they've been promoted for a long time. You're the one who refuses to use critical thinking and ask why? Show me one long term sociological study that came to the conclusion that two people of the same gender can't raise a healthy child; one that says two people of opposite genders always raise a healthy child; one that shows that children shouldn't learn about sex. Give me one good reason why two people of any gender couldn't be called a family? What would happen? Would the sky fall down? Why does it matter to you how other people live their lives? Or what they call themselves? It has no effect on your life whatsoever. Bread is not gonna be cheaper, homelessness won't disappear, neither will unemployment or income inequality. It won't end world hunger and the war in the middle east. None. Zero. Why should I be the one changing my mind? I do look at everything in a broader context than you. I accept everything that is not hurtful to another person as a legitimate way of living one's life. You're the one who wants to control things that are none of your business. You are way too narrow minded, indoctrinated and dogmatic. You can't think for yourself. You follow outdated principles promoted by bigots and hypocrites. You're a tool and they use you to maintain the status quo. And you obey them like the good little sheep you are."
Slovakia,2srs6a,TNTx74,0,Mon Jan 19 12:56:22 2015 UTC,"What do I mean by false, you ask?  No, I do not follow other people's opinions without thinking about them.  No, it is not true there is no evidence. The evidence is the society itself, able to survive centuries following these principles.  No, it is not true I refuse to think critically - I wouldn't stand up for a cause without being sure of my views.  No, it is not true that people should not care about the others and just let them do whatever they want - one of the principles of the society is the fact that it lives coherently, lone wolves usually don't make it far.  No, it is not true it has no impact on my life. Look at the cases in the Western Europe. It has gone as far as for example having to fulfill the statistics of adoption ratio to homosexual and heterosexual couples - and, closing the agencies that refuse to conform to this. So it does influence lives of other people.  Anyway, you were the one who said you did not want to continue this argument."

""Unique position"", its nothing but a bunch of words that no one even knows meaning of. We have more than third children born outside marriage today and that number will only increase. That completely nukes any argument about marriage as institution of of birth. What else is there? Its a choice of the people who want to make their committement formal and good for them. It may be unique to them, but for all others its just another paper on your local bureau that gives you benefits from the state. Like a driving license."

I'm a Christian, but personally, my marriage is not threatened by same-sex couples getting married. Additionally, I can think of gay couples who'd do a much better job at raising kids than some abusive alcoholic straight parents that spring to mind."
Slovakia,2srs6a,bajaja,3,Mon Jan 19 07:51:44 2015 UTC,"1) Church acts like they own a universal patent for marriage. That's medieval (dark ages) kind of mindset. But, yeah...you know...religion (sigh). I dont care who's getting ""married"" as long as they are both nice people and they truly love each other.   2) As it was mentioned many times before. Kids are better off growing up in a family or family-like environment. I think there are already some requirements in place for foster families to have a certain level of integrity, financial capacity, etc. before they can adopt a child. If the same principle is applied for same-sex couples, I don't see a problem there.  3) Kids should know what's up in terms of sex education, no matter what. Paradoxically this especially applies on those sheltered kids from super-religious families. So they don't get stuck being molested by a priest naively thinking it's ok. Yeah I know, it's a bold statement, but let's be real here.  EDIT: Spelling"

I am not pro homosexual adopting (which is to this day illegal in Slovakia, however the molesting of children by priests obviously isn't). I do agree that these people should have some rights to make an official relationship before the law system (not marriage!) because in many cases they live together for many years just like hetero couples, which brings the question of joint money saving and purchasing, or a visit in hospital if one of them is injured.  The third question is about sexual education is schools and I do disagree with it strongly. I have known personal cases of people who weren't educated at all in this, leading to them getting pregnant in very young age etc. ... Believe whatever You want, I just wanted to point out that instead of resolving and judging the questions which are already prohibited by the law (like the adopting), we should rather focus on the real monster here and by that I mean the secrets and practices of Slovak church, which all are coming upfront in silent compared to a storm all over Slovak internet and discussions caused by the referendum.."

In October, you risk snow; in November, hiking routes are closed. Routes don't open till 15th of june.  But of course, everything depends on current weather. Short-term weather forecast can be found here by selecting ""Stary Smokovec"" after ""Vyberte miesto"".  If you don't plan to hike, visit any time. Winter is very pretty in Tatras.  As for must-sees - it depends on how much can you walk. 10-15 km distance with 1 km elevation opens most of the places for you. But don't worry - some of the most interesting places are accesible without any physical trouble :).   Examples:   Lomnický štít - The second highest point in tatras, home to the observatory.

Slovakia,2rjlba,rollinrevue,24,Tue Jan 6 19:33:15 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your horrible experience. The golden rule of taxis in Bratislava is: you never ask the driver on street, you always call to a taxi company and ask for a taxi. It's cheaper for some strange reason.  This might seem a bit awkward for anyone not speaking Slovak. Luckily, there is another option which emerged a few months ago: the Hopin app. You see the price per km and the fixed fee in advance and you have the right to reject any proposed taxi if you don't like the price, car, driver's ratings or his current location.  From my experience, arrangement with Hopin is faster than calling a taxi service and you have the bonus that you see the taxi's location all the time so you can better estimate how much time you have until it arrives.  Now let's see the ticket. The first row is the guy's name. Then there is his home address, the tax identification number (DIČ) and the most important one: IČO. The IČO field identifies the company or the trade license uniquely. You can look it up in the Trade Register (or in Bussiness Register in case of a company - but taxi drivers have trade licenses). Well, according to the Trade Register, this guy ended his license officially on 3. Dec 2013! And there is no other Arpád Kocsis with any currently valid trade license. It smells to me.  So let's look up his license plate. This document is the first hit. It describes a taxi service audit by Slovak Trade Inspection - a bureau responsible for fair-play business practices etc. They started the ride at the bus station and asked the guy directly, without a prior telephone order, just like you. According to the audit, they didn't receive a ticket from his taxameter which is a violation of some law. So in some way, this guy is a known scammer. What strikes me, however, is the date of the audit - July 2014. It's after he shut down his business, officially. But they list the same IČO. It's either inspectors not checking up the validity of trade licenses of controlled drivers or there is some stupid Slovak law which allows you to use an identification number of a company which is officially closed down (that second option seems to be nonsensical to me - we have stupid laws, indeed, but not that stupid)!  I don't know what to think about it. You could file a ""Podnet ku kontrole"" - ""a suggestion for controll"" (unfortunately it's in Slovak only) which seems to be pretty informal or an official complaint which is more formal, requires a signed paper form and follows Slovak complaint law. But the presence of scammers at the train and bus stations is a well known fact among Slovak population of Bratislava. They might have some influential friends who cover their asses when needed (decent people don't drive black Mercedes)."

So their thinking process is simliar to: ""I am not getting paid to wait   There are few drivers who wait, but majority of them simply says that according to their plan this is when they are leaving and sod the rest. Company doesn´t really do anything against it as they are dicks themselves who sometimes punish drivers from not getting into end station in exact minute they are supposed to (which is impossible for them in case they are waiting on every second stop for those who are late) and the time schedule is really difficult to keep, impossible if there is even a small traffic jam."

Slovakia,2rd311,bloomautomatic,8,Mon Jan 5 03:10:53 2015 UTC,"Sharisko, would be spelled Šarisko, but it may be a mistranscription of Šarišsko (Sharishsko), which may refer to the historical region of Šariš in which Presov lies (the -ko suffix may be a colloquialism).  Slovak wikipedia confirms that the village Kellemer was renamed to Ľubotice in 1948. Šarišské Lúky is part of Ľubotice.  Presov is a city, which is the capital of Presov district (okres Presov) and of Presov region (Presovsky kraj).  The area was part of Hungarian kingdom (and later Austria-Hungary) from 1000 to 1918."

I think this is it. She was born in Prešov. Tomko is common name in this region, Gaži too, but in other region, Lipnicky is less common. (source http://slovnik.juls.savba.sk)"
Slovakia,2rd311,miarsk,3,Mon Jan 5 11:03:33 2015 UTC,"In Slovakian language we use ""Caron"" over some letters which change their pronauncination. ""S"" is pronounced as simple ""S"" in english and ""Š"" is pronounced ""Sh"" like in english word ""Shame"" for example. So funny english transcription of ""Sharisko"" would be written ""Šarišsko"" in Slovak language. Prefix -ko is not used anymore altrough it is still gramatically correct. So what was ""Šarišsko"" is after 150 years ""Šariš"". Here is wiki link. So it is name of region and name of ""Župa"", which was something like local administration (province, county, region...). It is also name of one beer brand these days. Lot of vilages in our regions have name of their region in them, that is why word ""šarišské/šarišský"" is in the name of some vilages. But it will not be case of your grandmother, what paper says is that she was born in the city of Prešov in the ""county"" of ""Šariš"". That is the place where was born, it does not mean she was living there. But that vilage you googled has probably nothing to do with her place of birth.   About Slovakian History - we have been part of Austria-Hungary in that time. There have been much oppresion from Hungarians (mostly after 1867) and in combination with bad economical situation it fueled emigration to other countries. Sometimes whole vilages decided to leave country. So your ancestors leaving country in 19th century was not such anusual phenomenon, whatever country you are from.   Names Tomko/Lipnický/Gaži are not so rare, so after 150 years it might be hard to find. It is possible, we have quite good archives in Europe and if you had more starting info than finding something might be possible with help of profesional historians. I am just not sure if it is worth for school project. But easier way might be finding Slovakian comunities in your country, for example if you are from USA than you might contact some american slovak organizations. Most Slovakian roots can be found in Cleveland and Pittsbourgh, but might be in other cities, for example in Chicago we had some emigrants because of good relations with polish people here in Europe. You might find more info for your project on the sites of those organizations, because other than wikipedia it is hard to find links for you about things you study in other than Slovak language."
Slovakia,2rd311,miarsk,2,Mon Jan 5 09:36:52 2015 UTC,"I suppose I should have put this info in the first post. I am in the USA and we are from the Pittsburgh Area. I've heard that more Slovaks settled in this area than anywhere else in America.   The local Slovak clubs around here don't have much info. Most of them are social clubs, basically private bars. We have what we need for his project. The rest of this is just for my own personal interest.  On the family tree, the last birth in Slovakia is Nov. 23, 1901 and the first in US is March 8, 1904. I seem to remember 1902 as when they immigrated.  Tomko and Lipnicky are names I'm familiar with in this area, but I don't know of any Gazi's outside of my family. Interesting that you say it's not rare.  Thanks for all the info on the regions. My son and I collect coins. We have a Hungarian 1893 10 Filler coin like this - http://www.eurogold.lv/items/4944/0.jpg. Would this have been the currency in use in this region? It says Magyar Kiralyi Valtopenz on the front.  Thanks."
Slovakia,2rd311,totallynotaltaccount,1 point,Tue Jan 6 03:39:43 2015 UTC,"I have read some statisticks that around 3 milion Slovaks are living outside of Slovakia. Wikipedia says that 1,5 milion Slovaks emigrated to USA only. Pittsburgh was one of their destionations, I have heard that main reasons are mines and railroads, as Slovakia had a lot of mining industry in 19th century so they went to places where they could use their knowledge and skills. I am not sure about this info though.   About 1902, as I said, whole vilages emigrated because of general situation in Austria-Hungary. Economically it has been terrible and culturaly hungarians have been oppressing everybody with different nationality. There has been different levels of hungarization, most violent was after 1907, so your ancestors packed their bags just about in time. Maybe if you check what they have been doing during WWI you might find out they have been somehow involved with their countrymen. Usually they have been sending money home for some relatives and some of them have been fighting in Czechoslovakian legions instead of regular US army.   About names, they are not totally common like ""Smith"" in USA, but they are not really rare, in Slovakia you might find people with these names. I checked etymology of those names for you in this document (Slovak language). Part of second names creation in our language comes from first name, usually from bible. ""Tomko"" is one of many variations of the hebrew name ""Thomas"" (page 29 of said document). We even have one kardinal with that name.  Lipnický - it means ""from Lipnica"", where Lipnica might be some vilage, small river, hill or something. ""Lipa"" is type of tree and is highly regarded in Slovakia, kind of ""national"" tree. Canadians have Maple, Slovakians have ""lipa"". I am not sure about ""Gaži"" etymology, but if you google that name you will get tons of people. Don't forget the ""hook"" over ""z"".    About the coin - it is standard coin of that time. It is equivalent of your ""cents"", in Slovakian language it is called ""halier"". It started to be used in 1892. But unlike USA we change our curencies every time something major happens, like world wars or revolutions, so this specific type was in use until the end of WWI, and since then we had Czechoslovakian curency of ""koruna"" and ""halier"". With hungarian name ""filler"" they are still used in present Hungary, but because of low level of their economy they are worthless and are not use in reality, only in some calculations and they round it up. Slovakia switched to Euro in 2009."

Slovakia,2pleer,oduuch,1 point,Wed Dec 17 18:16:58 2014 UTC,"There are several ways to pay for ticket for buses in Nitra:    1) One-ride-ticket can be purchased only from driver. You will be given a ticket and that is it. You do not have to mark it. This ticket is valid only for one ride and every time you transfer to other line you have to purchase new one.    2) Chip card (""EZČK"") which works as prepaid card. You charge the card with some amount and you use it with designated machine in the bus - it will charge the card automaticaly. This is cheaper way to do it - see link from kam_mam_ist where you can find prices for ticket purchased from driver (Cena u vodiča) and prices using card (Cena z EZČK).  3) Prepaid ticket can be purchased for one month (12€ for student) or 3 months (30€ for student).    Unfortunately you have to go personaly to the office in Nitra to get the card or prepaid ticket. I suggest your sister go with some slovak friend if she does not speak slovak language - I doubt, that office-lady will know english."
Slovakia,2oz4of,PTT_Derp,5,Thu Dec 11 14:48:10 2014 UTC,Hi there!  Well I think one of everyones first questions is gonna be: just where in Slovakia will you be staying? :-)
Slovakia,2oz4of,Sithril,2,Thu Dec 11 16:14:39 2014 UTC,"Banská Bystrica or Košice, I'm not too sure...  Does anyone know how to go to these place from Vienna airport?  I bought the ticket to Vienna but I have no idea how to go to Slovakia..."
Slovakia,2oz4of,Sithril,4,Thu Dec 11 16:25:51 2014 UTC,"I bought the ticket to Vienna but I have no idea how to go to Slovakia...   Take a 20 minute bus to Bratislava. (small joke, but Vienna and Bratislava are like next to each other)   Does anyone know how to go to these place from Vienna airport?   Well Košice has an international airport. According to their site there are regular flights to Košice. Beyond that there are regular trains and buses going from Bratislava to Košice; and most likely a few direct links from Vienna as well - but given youre a foreigner in a country whos language you dont speak, Id recomend trying to find one such direct link from Vienna.  As for Bystrica, well, there is no airport. And getting a direct link from Vienna might be harder, since its a smaller city - you may need to catch another link in Bratislava to get there.  These two websites (for general bus/train search and for trains specificly ) might be helpful - but I presume someone from Educate Slovakia should help you with finding your way! (I am kinda surprised you even have to ask this here)     Banská Bystrica or Košice   Well snap! I live in Košice and go to Bystrica on a almost weekly basis cause of school! Maybe I should find some spare time in my diary."

I used the ones that included Slovakia as a part of Eastern Europe. And I meant it purely geographically, without any connotation of values/ mentality some may associate with Eastern Europe. I am personally from Croatia, and I consider it to be a part of Eastern Europe, without it meaning anything bad. But I do understand why one may associate it with bad connotations, given the media image E. Europe gets."

Spišský Hrad is the biggest one in Central Europe and it's in UNESCO, nice place, just an hour from Spišské Podhradie walking. Spišské Podhradie has a nice historic centre and there are some interesting places - look up the ""Spišský Jeruzalem"", a system of chapels near the town resembling those in Jerusalem. ""Sivá Brada"" is one of the most famous, but there are some more. Another interesting place is ""Dreveník"" - a pile of travertine, national reservation, UNESCO heritage, all of these just near the town. Spišské Podhradie belongs to the region Spiš (Zips in German). Spiš itself is a beautiful, nice country - Levoča, maybe 10 km from Sp. Podhradie, is a wonderful town - also in UNESCO, famous for the highest wooden altar in World carved by Master Paul. ""Slovenský Raj"" is a national park, with a lot of tourist paths, it's near the town ""Spišská Nová Ves""; High Tatras, the highest mountains in Slovakia; Poprad - the biggest town in the region...Spiš is quite big, so I've mentioned what I think is important, but I may have forgotten something...

I have to admit that I know very little about Slovakia in general, but your suggestions have been a great starting point.  I love history and it seems this region is rich in it.  You mentioned that the Spiš region also has a German name.  I have been curious about the ethnic makeup of the region, since it seems to have changed hands many times in the last couple centuries.  I read that before WWI, as much as 35% of the population of this region was German and only very few were Hungarian.  Do you know what it is like today?    There's so much I wish I could have asked my great-grandmother before she passed away.  I'm not even sure what religion or ethnicity she was.    Thanks again for your reply!"

I gave him the ship record, their names, town, and I guessed they were from the Greek Christian church (since it was far east Slovakia) and had the records emailed within a week..

Slovakia,2nxodw,jamesagarfield2,2,Tue Dec 2 15:19:45 2014 UTC,It's a shame there was no referendum for this.
Slovakia,2nlxce,Aries512,13,Thu Nov 27 20:53:40 2014 UTC,And let's not forget the other question about parents being able to not let their children attend any sex education classes or lessons AT FUCKING SCHOOL.   So proud.
Slovakia,2nlxce,Jjinxy,8,Thu Nov 27 21:11:14 2014 UTC,It's just bullshit. I think there will be max 20% attendance.
Slovakia,2nlxce,Pascalwb,10,Thu Nov 27 21:21:27 2014 UTC,"Let's hope. I too believe that attendance won't reach more than 50%. But if it will, these stupid middle-ages propositions will probably pass. It will be religious fanatics and general idiots who will attend in big groups to stop those ""filthy gays"" and ""sex in schools"", most of normal 21st century people will bet on low attendance. And lot of people probably don't care at all, or isn't decided yet. Fasten your seatbelts, hold your hats (and fedoras), hate campagin in churches will be strong in coming months."
Slovakia,2nlxce,Jjinxy,3,Thu Nov 27 21:26:58 2014 UTC,"Oh, I read ""camping in churches"". It might be the best or the most horrific idea."
Slovakia,2nlxce,Nikopol_SK,3,Thu Nov 27 21:33:48 2014 UTC,"Given that churches are every Sanday completely empty, I really don´t worry that much. KBS can organize their bullshit rallies in Košice when half of Poland is convinced to come, but even Sulik got this many signatures with his referendum. What was the result? 20%? And that was one of the higher turnouts. And people will not come on cold Saturday, they will keep at home, doing shit as always.  Fuck this and hopefully it will be forgotten soon together with this bunch of retards from AZR."
Slovakia,2nlxce,Neamow,4,Thu Nov 27 22:04:28 2014 UTC,"I really am no expert in Slovak churches (being atheist my whole life and stuff), but sometimes when I pass around church, I see lot of people in there. Even in Bratislava, not only in smaller town and villages. In Kosice, I've seen people standing in front of church (smaller one, not cathedral) because they didn't fit in. I don't know if they have been giving away some free Bibles or what, but the attendance surprised me.  Damn, they have been able to get 400k people to sign their petition, that is something. I still hope it's the ""loud minority"" and not some general pro-middle-ages sentiment.  But it is true that many of those who claim they are catolics/christians consider it to be more cultural/hereditary thing than actual religiosity."
Slovakia,2nlxce,Pascalwb,1 point,Thu Nov 27 22:17:59 2014 UTC,"That's exactly how I feel. Most people won't care, and those who will go vote will be those that don't want the referendum to succeed. It needs way more exposure."
Slovakia,2nlxce,mithik,2,Thu Nov 27 22:06:01 2014 UTC,"Oh, do you mean 20% turnout for the vote? Attendance usually refers to school, so I thought at first you were saying 20% of the kids going to the sex ed classes...."

Slovakia,2nlxce,mishko27,5,Fri Nov 28 10:09:42 2014 UTC,Majority should not decide on minority rights. Plain and simple.
Slovakia,2nlxce,marosk0,2,Sun Nov 30 07:53:23 2014 UTC,"Well then who decides ? if you have better alternative then democracy and referendum i am all ears, just because something doesnt fit your personal agenda doesnt mean you are right and other people wrong, people decide in referendum. Besides Slovakia is part if EU if we fuck with human rights they will intervene."
Slovakia,2nlxce,mishko27,4,Sun Nov 30 08:16:01 2014 UTC,"Referendums are great in order for the citizens to show their opinions on a number of issues, but simply not when it concerns the minorities. Do you think that Americans would ever vote for equal rights for blacks? Nope, at least on in 60s they wouldn't. The role of the government in democratic nations is to protect minorities and by allowing this referendum to be held, the government is failing to fulfill its role."
Slovakia,2nlxce,marosk0,2,Sun Nov 30 09:00:16 2014 UTC,"You understand that government has nothing to do with referendum, i know that everyone hates Fico but President of Slovakia sent these questions to the Highest court and it decided referendum can be held and doesnt violate human rights, and if minorities feel opressed they can turn to European court of human rights, so you see there is plenty of safeguards.What else do you want a committee like we used to have during communism to decide whats right and wrong?"
Slovakia,2nlxce,mishko27,3,Sun Nov 30 09:09:06 2014 UTC,"Nope. I just don't agree with the decision of the Supreme Court. While Supreme Courts around the world consider these issues to be human rights related, ours doesn't? Gimme a break."

Slovakia,2nlxce,skriblsaurus,4,Fri Nov 28 10:57:15 2014 UTC,Oh I misunderstood. Wasnt it already banned tho? I remember Robert Fico banned it like 2-3 months ago no?
Slovakia,2nlxce,Venmar,3,Fri Nov 28 11:02:34 2014 UTC,"I think that banned same-sex unions, not marriage. Or it did and they want to ban it again, for some reason. The referendum also includes a question about same-sex adoption and whether sexual education should be compulsory at schools."
Slovakia,2nlxce,mishko27,6,Fri Nov 28 11:05:59 2014 UTC,Fuck all you saying you're ashamed all the time. You have no sense of perspective whatsoever. You have to realize how far we've gone since 17.11.1989 and start comparing us to other post-communistic countries.

The problem with starting a business here is the apathy of the people. Everywhere you turn you find people who are still stuck in communism. They do not have drive, no excitment to better themselves. Everyone sees the world in a light where nothing is possible. When you have enthusiasm and drive to get something done, you get a lot of people that will just tell you. ""That seems like a good idea but this is Slovakia, it is different here. I may not work""  Some of my experience is based on my particular field but I am finding that the population as a whole is much like this on any topic. I am working with two potential investors for my project. They are stock market type people. Their office is in a upscale glass building, they are at the top of their game in Bratislava. Yet after a few meetings with them you have to wonder how on earth they managed to make it that far. They are very slow to move on anything thing and the way they conduct business feels like they are not motivated to do much of anything. Again I don't believe it is my project that is bringing this out. They came to me, I did not knock on their door. So I have to think they are interested.   I have only been living here for 3 months, so I am still adjusting, but it goes all the way down to the clerks at the grocery store. Most people just seem to have no desire to make steps forward. They are happy to live in their homes that are paid off, take incentives from the government and not really push the limits. My circle of friends here are on the upper end of ""middle class"" and they are all pretty lazy and don't really do much to increase their worth or living styles. They are just happy staying on an even float.  Americans work hard. They are always in a hurry and some say we are slaves to society. Not taking vacations or living to only buy the next ""thing"". This may be true but I believe there is passion in it. There is a reason our country has come so far in a small amount of time compared to other nations.  I admit that most of my frustration is my fault. I am addicted to my work. I like getting up in the morning and spending all day in my brewery and all night with my customers. So it is a big change being here and not having anything to do for the moment. My business plan is done, All my equipment and suppliers are setup. I am just waiting around now for the right investors to bite and it is boring and frustrating not having anything to do.  Anyway, long rant. Slovakia is a great place. My attitude will change soon I am sure. My advice though is to be patient with anything you do here."

Slovakia,2lz787,3506_work,7,Tue Nov 11 16:31:05 2014 UTC,"I don't think you'll have any problems with Slovan fans in the city centre. YBB is not a rival since federal times like Sparta Praha. I'm not expecting this match to be problematic. If you won't provoke them actively you'll be OK.  Anyway, Slovan fans go to U belasych or maybe Centralna Klubovna (that one is mostly for ice hockey fans who are friendly). Both of the pubs are not in the Old Town. My advice is to go to Old Town right after the match. It's highly probable you won't meet a single Slovan fan in there (at least not dressed in Slovan jersey), especially if you land in a better restaurant.  As for the restaurants and sightseeing, you can find useful info in older threads:   http://www.reddit.com/r/Slovakia/comments/w50j3/two_girls_coming_to_bratislava_in_august/ http://www.reddit.com/r/Slovakia/comments/23dbkp/good_places_to_eat_in_bratislava/ http://www.reddit.com/r/Slovakia/comments/26s3ir/coming_to_bratislava_for_2_days_what_to_see/ http://www.reddit.com/r/Slovakia/comments/1usgjf/the_best_cultural_restaurants_in_bratislava/ http://www.reddit.com/r/Slovakia/comments/28nkbd/help_us_make_our_tour_to_bratislava_into_an/ http://www.reddit.com/r/Slovakia/comments/ono47/any_suggestions_of_things_to_do_in_bratislava/   In short: walk around the Old Town (it's really small!), visit Bratislava Castle, Devin Castle, UFO; and if you want some action then go to Cunovo Whitewater Areal, laser tag arena or electric karts arena.  If you like rock music I recommend Barrock or British Rock Stars Pub.  For a good beer, try Cierny pes (Black Dog) pub (a small pub with a great atmosphere, but they offer only cold meals, usually bread with some spread), Bratislava City Brewery one or two (they serve their own beer and cook very well), or Castle Brewery."

It's going to take you years because it's intrinsically difficult. Three years later I can still only talk about the weather.  The wages are low. Come here for the marvelous scenery, the breathtaking history, the good people, or the spectacular wine, but don't come here with the expectation of getting rich off the wages. The average Slovak wage is still around €850 per month. IT will pay more, but not a hell of a lot more.  The immigration system is a catastrophe. Be warned. You will be waiting at 3 AM in a queue with other foreigners and refugees if you're registering at the Bratislava ""Alien police"" department. Your IT company should take care of most of this, but you'll no doubt still have to queue up in the cold.  People may appear ""cold"" at first on the street and in shops. They're not, it's just not in Slovak culture to wander around with a goofy smile on their faces all day. Don't expect to hear the plastic ""Have a niiice daaay"" (my skin is crawling) greetings every few minutes in shops.    So, that's the stuff to be aware of. Otherwise Slovakia is like any other European country. It has its highs and lows like anywhere.   Personally, I love that Slovakia is an honest place. They're not caught up on political correctness. The architecture and history is out of this world, the food is uniquely different, and Slovaks know good wine and beer. Oh, I know everyone thinks they know good wine and beer, but prepare to be educated on what real quality drinks & spirits taste like. This country opened my eyes to how wine & beer should taste.  Slovaks (in my experience) are also some of the most generous human beings on the planet. Once you form a friendship with a Slovak, it's for life. That's something that I'm still getting used to, coming from the land of superficialness. :) You'll notice this when you settle in.   So, have fun, enjoy yourself, and WELCOME! I'm sure you'll love it here."

Slovakia,2ld0s1,Dobrrk,4,Wed Nov 5 15:18:45 2014 UTC,I think you will be fine with another Slavic language for a couple of months and then you pick up everyday Slovak. meanwhile you can take classes to speed up the process and learn written grammar.

The hard part is, how do you make a flying car that's super safe and quiet? Because if it's a howler, you're going to make people very unhappy.   and    I'm not sure about the flying cars. If the sky was full of cars flying all over the place, it would affect how things look. It would affect the skyline.

Slovakia,2keyhy,IrishTea,7,Sun Oct 26 23:54:48 2014 UTC,"It was this event.   SMER, the only party that is currently in the government and KDH (the Christian-Democratic movement) passed a constitutional amendment that forbids any law that would allow gay marriages. Of course, that really hasn't changed anything because you can just call it ""registered partnership"". So, the scum united under the banner of ""Aliancia za rodinu"" (The Alliance For Family) has organized a petiton to hold a referendum with 4 questions:   Do you agee that no cohabitation of two persons except a union between a man and a woman should be called marriage? Do you agree that pairs or groups of same-sex persons should not be allowed to adopt children and raise them? Do you agree that no other cohabitation except marriage should have the special rights and duties that are, according to the laws valid on 2014-03-01, only granted to marriages? Do you agree that schools may not require the participation of children on classes that concern sexual behavior or assisted suicide (euthanasia), if their parents, or the children themselves do not agree with the contents of the class?   Keep in mind that none of these things are currently legal in Slovakia and they were not planned in near future.  The President has sent these questions to the Constitutional Court to which will say, whether these questions concern basic human rights, which is something you can't hold a referendum about. That pretty much destroyed the Alliance's plan, which relied on holding the referendum on the same day as the local elections, which will be held in November. It's mostly agreed that that was the only way they would have been able to achieve the 50% turnout, required for a referendum to pass.  The people you saw were protesting the President's decision, in a silent (and hopefully ineffective) manner."
Slovakia,2keyhy,sellweek,5,Mon Oct 27 18:25:45 2014 UTC,Thank you very much for explaining it so well. So it was effectively a homophobic campaign pretending to be a civilised demonstration.   Let's hope the constitutional court throws it out. It's 2014 and we're part of the European Union for heaven's sake.
Slovakia,2keyhy,Dakujem,3,Mon Oct 27 19:32:37 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's quite disgusting, especially if you try listening to their arguments. They've invented a new term: ""homolobby"", which is a simple means of discrediting their opponents - if you disagree, you're paid by a massive international conspiracy which wants to introduce the rule of the ""Death culture"" (another lovely neologism, this time by KBS - The Slovak Bishop Conference).   The most ironic thing is how they've been able to reverse the reality. In their minds, they're a bunch of heroes saving the world from destruction, even though, if you look at the balance sheets of the few pro-gay organizations in Slovakia, they live from meagre donations, while the Alliance is a massive propaganda operation paid for by the Slovak Roman Catholic Church, which is not a particularly poor organization.  They maintain a strict distinction between ""being gay"" and ""acting gay"", which is what allows them to maintain a facade of being a normal organization. As they say:   We're fighting for important societal values - family, marriage, children, and for their support, protection and legal security. We're against any oppression or harm, against any discrimination. However, we don't think that the society should yield to demands that don't recognize the real meaning, merit and uniqueness of marriage as an ideal space for the upbringing of children. The ideal of raising children in a complete family with a mother and a father is irreplaceable. Great video here   [Source]  After listening to their leaders, you realize that they really don't discriminate, because in their twisted minds, there are two ways you can live when you're gay. If you're gay, but suppress it, hate yourself and (ideally) go through some gay conversion therapy, you're a great person. If, though, you're out or you have a partner and (gosh!) live like a traditional family except you both have the same gender - you're psychopatic, you're endangering children etc. (a catholic priest, officially unaffiliated with the Alliance said that gays were commiting a genocide on our nation.

Slovakia,2keyhy,Dakujem,1 point,Wed Oct 29 15:10:12 2014 UTC,"Well, a lot of lawyers agree that it was in his power to refuse the referendum before sending it to the Constitutional Court. However, now that the court has decided that three of the questions are not forbidden, he has to schedule it.  Some people seem to think that by throwing out the question about prohibiting registered cohabitation, the Constitutional court has declared it to be a basic right. We'll see, maybe it will have some consequences."

Also I am starting extremely cheap shipping company leveraging students. /s
Slovakia,2jzbpo,bliker,2,Wed Oct 22 15:02:34 2014 UTC,I honestly don't know a single student who thinks this is great. I don't know what Fico is going after...he cannot possibly think it would rise his popularity among young students. Maybe he'll get some more elderly. Or is he trying to fuck up this country even more so in case he will loose again in election winning party will just fail in short time? As we all know already happened last time. I'm seriously starting to think that.
Slovakia,2jzbpo,Jjinxy,2,Wed Oct 22 21:09:50 2014 UTC,"Just another Fico's dirty trick how to get some cheap votes from pensioners. (as most students are smart enough not to fall for this shit).

Current mayor (Igor Choma - Smer) promised free public transportation in the city if he wins the election again."

Retirees who have nothing to do all days will have a new hobby too - riding trains back and forth and taking up space for people who actually need to use trains. Adults, who still need to pay full price for ticket, will get worse quality or transport for the same price. Adults who use trains to travel to their job will get 50% off the ticket price though? Seems pretty unfair, even though the intentions might have been good. Some buses will get canceled, other probably more expensive.. How in the world did Fico think this would be a good idea.  TLDR - What a fucking joke."

The opposition are suggesting it's a precursor to privatising the country's water supplies, of which this country has many. No one outside of the governing Smer party knows the reason for certain yet.

Slovakia,2jbh5t,octopus_bill,6,Wed Oct 15 14:10:09 2014 UTC,"After you finish you studies you have to get employed by hospital to get further specialisation/education. It is called ""atestácia"" (attestation). There are several levels of this attestation. As doctor you also have to further educate yourself - you have to visit congresses etc. to get credits.    Pick you specialisation wisely. Some specialisations are quite lucrative since there are not enough doctors - for example specialists in anaestesia or neurology. If you are qualified anaestesiologist(you have attestation in it), hospital will break their hands to get you...    You should also check Slovak Medical Chamber to get more info and by check I mean contact them with questions because their english version of website is very simple."
Slovakia,2jbh5t,oduuch,3,Thu Oct 16 10:12:01 2014 UTC,"Thank you for answering :) all these info are really interesting and, at least, I know omething more about this issue :) do you by any chance know anything about further tuition fees for the specialization? Again thanks,and in case yu will have any more info, do share :)"
Slovakia,2jbh5t,oduuch,2,Thu Oct 16 19:35:26 2014 UTC,"There are no tuition fees for the specialization (as Mustaflex told you).    You need to get employed in the hospital department in which you want to specialize (for example neurology department) and then after few years of practice you can try to get attestation. Unfortunately I do not know  how it works exactly.    Feel free to ask at your university, they should be able to explain it to you. If office ladies suck as I remember at faculty in Bratislava, just let me know. We will sort it out.    What you have to do is learn Slovak language to be able to be employed in Slovak hospital. You can expect salary between 600-800€ as young doctor in hospital. It can get much better after you get your first attestation. If you will get your second attestation you can become head doctor of department."
Slovakia,2jbh5t,Mustaflex,3,Thu Oct 16 20:09:06 2014 UTC,"If you do residency here, you are employee of hospital and you get paid by hospital normal salary. Other than that I would have to ask my friends who finished school and are now working."

Because asking for permission just sounds so weird and nobody is asking for permission to marry someone in Slovakia...  But asking her parents, if they are happy, when you are going to marry their daughter is ok. And you can do this by asking for ""požehnanie"" (""požehnanie""=""give blessing""). If her parents will say yes, it means that they are happy and whish you the best and luck in future marriage and at last it also means that they are accepting (approve) to marry their daughter.   But in real life is common this scenario in Slovakian families: * Girlfriend: ""Hi mom and dad. This is my boyfriend and we are going to marry."" * Parents: ""Yeaah!! Let`s go drink!"" :-D"

Slovakia,2hzp89,Neamow,5,Wed Oct 1 15:55:01 2014 UTC,"The countries of western Europe were struck just as hard as Slovakia, if not more. Russia knows all too well who is responsible for the sanctions and most of their sanctions are directly aimed at those countries.  In short, they expected Russia to cave in and die under the pressure of a smaller volume of trade with Europe (see Britain's sanctions on Rhodesia). Instead, Russia is opening new trade channels with Brazil, China and various African nations instead. The only ones getting fucked over here is the EU - they realize that now. On a positive note, Slovakia will now be forced to grow more independent of it's Soviet era ally.  When you mention ""neodvážia sa na nič priamejšie"" what do you suggest exactly, military intervention? How naive do you have to be to think Slovakia, as Ukraine's neighbor, would profit from that? Follow the international news these days surrounding US-Russia relations. It's a lot more relevant to you than you might think.  Source: Political Economy expert"
Slovakia,2hzp89,Torpedoe,7,Wed Oct 1 19:57:16 2014 UTC,"I am afraid to challenge the political economy expert's opinion, but there's no way Russia can replace the trade with Europe with Brazil, China and African nations. how do they deliver oil there?  also the US and the EU are in no way going for Russian's caving. I think everyone knows the only stable future is with stable and prospering Russia cooperating with us but their breaking of international law closes this way for now.  yes nobody wants or can afford war and everyone would suffer."
Slovakia,2hzp89,bajaja,7,Wed Oct 1 21:10:14 2014 UTC,"You are correct. When I talked about trading with the BRICS and African nations, I was referring to the EU sanctions. The products which are no longer being exported into Russia from Europe are now coming from the aforementioned countries. Sorry if that point was unclear.  On the topic of oil, Russia will not cut off Europe. All they are doing is playing a game of tip-for-tat: sanction for sanction. If nothing else, they might push oil into one of the other several dozens of countries they border with. For now, Europe is too much of an important market for them.  In the long term, the super-economies (EU, US, Russia) will keep trading - they are too dependent on each other. By caving in, I meant that they hoped Russia would get back in line with the UN/NATO when they would start seeing products disappear off shelves in supermarkets. Unfortunately, they underestimated Russia's market power. They tried to use the same policy that would work on a smaller, more dependent country - a complete rookie mistake."

Oil cut-off, little scare from their part can kill peope. I believe some people died in Bulgary last time Russia and Ukraine played their game.  Sanctions - I was under impression they worked. But haven't read it anywhere explicitly.

Slovakia,2hm6g8,splintersmaster,15,Sat Sep 27 14:02:13 2014 UTC,"it is common. also many people dont tip at all and it's not considered very rude (basically you tip when you are satisfied, it's not like (from what I have heard) in america where tips are a large (if not whole) part of a waiter's salary. I usually round up to next higher 10cents or euro."

Slovakia,2hm6g8,miarsk,1 point,Sat Sep 27 23:01:05 2014 UTC,If it is OK in face of your familly is personal matter for you and I will not comment on that one. But you should know tipping is expected in food industry from honest man and you should round up only small amounts. Anything bigger is 10%.
Slovakia,2hm6g8,DitaVonCleese,1 point,Tue Oct 7 08:25:15 2014 UTC,"It is rude not to tip, don't tell it isn't. The only ocasion you don't tip is when you are extremly dissatisfied with waitress or food or something. Your tip should be around 5-10% of bill.  It might be forgivable for students which don't have much money on them to tip, but don't prettend it is normal just because you are cheapskate.   On the other hand 20% is too much and might offend waiter, just stick with 5-10% if everything was ok."
Slovakia,2hm6g8,miarsk,3,Mon Oct 6 11:04:42 2014 UTC,"It is, but for example when I was <19 I was ashamed to tip, because it was a ""grown up"" thing. And I don't make my own money yet, so it always felt kinda weird..  And I said ""very"", no not at all. Nobody will frown at you or yell at you if you don't tip. Many many people don't tip at all, especially the older ones.  Huh, ""other hand 20% is too much and might offend waiter"" ? Really? You really think that giving someone too much money would be considered offensive? Have you ever been in Slovakia?"
Slovakia,2hm6g8,Pimplik,1 point,Tue Oct 7 07:39:36 2014 UTC,"I am Slovak so yes. As I said, it is tolerable with students, as they usually struggle with money. But generally speaking not to tip makes you look like ""sedlak"" (hard to translate, maybe ""redneck"" is the closest one) and you will be considered as one. No one will tell it to your face (it is against etiquete to say such thing, but decent company will deffinitelly think that about not-tipping person). Not even the waiter will tell you what you are, but will deffinitelly make his opinion about you and will serve you acordingly when he sees you next time (if he remebers you). As was said before, rounding up is OK for small bills, 10% is normal tip, 20% is much and might be offensive, mainly to waitress tiped from man, and decent waiter/waitress will refuse high tip. If you are payng 47,65€ and you round it up to 48 you are just a dick and will be percieved as one."
Slovakia,2hm6g8,liboration,13,Tue Oct 7 07:50:09 2014 UTC,I would say it's quite common to just round up. The staff won't be insulted if you do that but I know they would love you if you tipped 20% :)
Slovakia,2hm6g8,yreg,12,Sat Sep 27 14:05:27 2014 UTC,"I live in Bratislava. I speak for Bratislava this may vary elsewhere. I hang out with people with various ""societal statuses"". The average and well respected etiquette is 10% which is considered polite and connotes satisfaction. 20% is really exceptional service. Rounding up is acceptable under 5€. No tip means you are not satisfied. Very low tip (cents) is insulting and done on purpose if the service is bunch of dickwarts."
Slovakia,2hm6g8,WineVirus,5,Sat Sep 27 15:25:01 2014 UTC,"I feel it's exactly like this. I mostly just round up as I think that tips are wrong (IMHO waiters should be paid by their employers and taxed like the rest of us), but I don't want to be rude by not tipping at all.  So, splintersmaster, just tip whatever you feel like, it's not a big deal."
Slovakia,2hm6g8,rubbermeetroad,3,Sat Sep 27 18:45:26 2014 UTC,I know EXACTLY how you feel. My wife is native Slovak as well. The first time we went out. We stopped for lunch and spent about €25. I left a 5 and she looked at me like I was crazy.
Slovakia,2hm6g8,miarsk,2,Tue Sep 30 18:40:03 2014 UTC,As an American with a Slovak wife. Tipping in the USA is a standard 15%. Some tip more some less. It is 80% of the server's pay. This is only for a Meal where you are served at a table or bar.
Slovakia,2hm6g8,MoravianPrince,2,Sat Sep 27 21:12:53 2014 UTC,"It is same in Slovakia. Decent man tips, but % changes with the employers wage and circumstances. You tip for example hairdresser or at cosmetic saloon. Or the guy doing masage. For example I tip at autoservis I visit regulary, they have jar for it. It is decent to tip for any type of personal service. Mostly those that do something extra for you.   For example I had this guy bring me firewood on the truck for this winter (medium sized truck with arm). He was kind enough to put it into my yard on not so conviniet place, spent extra half an hour replacing baskets with wood where I wanted it, and when he asked 15€ I gave him 20, which seems like big tip but it was a lot of effort he didn't have to put into my personal comfort.   Sometimes they even say price that is easily tippable, like chimney-sweeper few weeks ago doing my chimney clearing asked 18€ (which is ok price) and it was easy to give him 20.   As a child I remember tipping workers of waste disposal and postman even in big cities every christmas for their whole year service, but this custom is on decline. But is perserved in some cities, mostly smaller ones.   And tiping is deffinitelly expected in food service. They even have this boxes in fast-food restaurants for charity, as policy of these shitty places forbids employees to take tips and people have been tipping anyway. Now they have to say every time somebody tries to tip them that it should be put into charity-box."

I am not gonna look a gifted horse in the mouth, shaving off 10-15% of my expenses is not nothing, but Id like if the goverment did something about my future, not a temporary band-aid that in the end may cost me more in the long run on taxes than I give away on train tickets!  Isnt it gonna cost like 10mil EUR or more? Ofcourse, or national budget is not overflowing with money, so they will have to get it from somewhere. Question is: do we want them to take the money from somewhere else? I cant think of anything in our contry that has an overflowing budget.

While it's available to those who know how to get it, I would probably suggest that comparatively, the Slovak Republic is not an ideal destination for obtaining marijuana as possession of the substance here is both illegal and a criminal act - and trust me, you don't want to experience the Slovak legal system in all its glory! It would be an unforgettable holiday, and not in a good way.  The Czech Republic on the hand is a different story. I recommend waiting til to you get there, assuming you're on a multi-country trip.  In the meantime, enjoy Slovakia without weed. It is possible, believe it or not! :D"

Slovakia,2gcrkr,YearOfTheMoose,3,Mon Sep 15 06:02:11 2014 UTC,"Well, you're not very far from the airport there...  How far from IKEA are you willing to travel? I mean, you're only 20 minutes or so from the city center. I can't think of anything that is tremendously ""Slovak"" aside from ice cream stores and old architecture within walking distance, though; maybe there's a hole-in-the-wall place of historical interest, but someone else would have to chip in about that.   EDIT: You might be able to buy a Slovak jersey in the Avion shopping center across the parking lot from you. I never saw any there, but maybe they've started to sell them since I left? Anyway, I normally bought jerseys from the Atak store downtown, but I'm not sure if it's still there."
Slovakia,2gcrkr,yreg,2,Sun Sep 14 18:55:34 2014 UTC,"I don't think there is any kind of fan shop in Avion. Matfrat will probably have to travel to the city.  But hey, it takes 10-20 minutes to get to Polus City Center with buses 61/63 + 50!  There is another store with hockey jerseys at our hockey stadium and that one is just 10 minutes away with buses 61/63 - bus stop Zimný štadión."

Slovakia,2gcfuz,TopsyMitoTurvy,4,Sun Sep 14 05:38:32 2014 UTC,No its not like football. its on smaller scale. But lots of people that are somehow interested in hockey watch NHL. But most people just watch hockey on Olympics or when Slovakia is playing.

Slovakia,2gcfuz,Lolkac,1 point,Tue Sep 16 01:25:36 2014 UTC,"Football/soccer.. But not our league. Lot of people watch premier League, Spanish league or Bundesliga.. Its way ahead of hockey. Maybe its because hockey is usually late at night and not everyone can stay up for the game"
Slovakia,2gcfuz,Pascalwb,1 point,Tue Sep 16 07:18:40 2014 UTC,"Football and Hockey are most popular. Then I would say F1, at least for me, but it's not as popular as the first two."

If you want some slovak documents/films, check out SME, you can find some of them online (you have to pay a subscription though) and it's completely legal. Other than that, probably just typing a movie name and CZ dubbing after it could work (since I've seen that there are some full movies with czech dubbing on YouTube)."

Slovakia,2g1f9w,yreg,0,Fri Sep 12 23:06:34 2014 UTC,Theres like a site called: ulozto.cz You can find both slovakian and czech dubbed or subbed movies there. Most Slovaks understand Czech without ever having to learn the language. Be careful some of us are a bit too nationalistic and might get offended by czech subs or dubbing. Ask first which language they want. Not always youll find the movie you want with the dubbing or subtitles you want. Downloading for free takes a bit longer. If you need more info just ask.
Slovakia,2g1f9w,Demolitarian,7,Wed Sep 10 22:15:37 2014 UTC,"""Be careful some of us are a bit too nationalistic and might get offended by czech subs or dubbing."" I live here for 27 years and this is first time I have heard such nonsense. I do not know anyone who could get even slightly offended by czech language. Not cool to spread rumors like this.   Czech or slovak language is totally ok.  You can check these sites http://kinotv.cz/  www.film-serial.sk/filmy/"

This is the thing I hate about my country, everyone here somehow thinks that their opinion is the truth set in stone and if my opinion doesnt match yours I am talking ""nonsense"" and ""spreading rumours"". No I have met my fair share of idiots who hate Czechs for ""destroying our country"". Just because you are lucky enough to just meet the people who share your views does not mean there arent any people out there who dislike Czechs. I for one went to school with 4 people who hated just seeing Czech Republic on a world map. 27, cute, how many people you got to know in that time, closely enough to know who they like and who not? 100? Less? Theres 5 MILLION people here. The Anti-czech sentiment exists, even though its sad and I would like it to be gone. Some people are unreasonable and just want to hate something."
Slovakia,2g1f9w,Demolitarian,6,Thu Sep 11 19:38:50 2014 UTC,"Why are you so angry and hate so much? I don't really understand, maybe just a bad day. I can safely say that Anty-czech sentiment is nowhere to be found here. I did not even heard about it before you mentioned it here. Nothing, that is why I said what I said.  Calm down, take a deep breath and stop being so angry, it's not good for you :)"
Slovakia,2g1f9w,sabakunomarek,-3,Thu Sep 11 20:47:48 2014 UTC,"I am neither angry nor am I hating anyone. I dont hate Czechs! My grandma is Czech. And again you are proving my point: ""I can safely say that Anty-czech sentiment is nowhere to be found here. I did not even heard about it before you mentioned it here. Nothing, that is why I said what I said."" What you are basically saying: "" I am too ignorant to realise there are stupid people out there just because I myself havent met them in my 27 years of life on this planet but I am just going to make an assumption even though its illogical to judge 5 million+ people based on the 100 I have talked to."" Do you think that the world is like this candyland where everyone loves everyone else and all day we just hug each other? Where do you live unless its Streda nad Bodrogom I should move there if thats the way it works in your city. No there are hateful people out there whenever you may like it or not. There are Czechs who hate Slovaks, there are many Hungarians who dislike us for Trianon. Heck if I took the time and searched I bet I can find at least one American who knows where Slovakia is and hates us for his own personal reasons. I dont like it, you dont like it but thats the way it is. Someone said once: ""Everything in this universe has at least one hater"""

Slovakia,2f4oy1,bajaja,3,Mon Sep 1 20:14:08 2014 UTC,"The fact that SMER won even in Bratislava was really disappointing, but that was 2 years ago. If you recall we had presidential election since then, where Fico was defeated, so I would not be so sure most people support him."
Slovakia,2f4oy1,goalie2point0,-3,Mon Sep 1 23:49:24 2014 UTC,"Sweetheart, I never said that all of you who are not from Bratislava are rednecks or hillbillies. But it is true that the communists or as they call themselves nowadays ""socialists"" won in nearly all regional elections except for the capital and the lovely Banska Bystrica which wisely chose a fascist. I was being sarcastic. If you did not support Smer and do not go driving and blocking the capitals streets like you own the fucking place and if you dont call the capital Blava you are not a redneck or hillbilly."
Slovakia,2f4oy1,clovak,-2,Tue Sep 2 00:08:29 2014 UTC,Can someone explain this to me?  Is slovakia a pro-russia country?
Slovakia,2f4oy1,grumbal,19,Mon Sep 1 01:15:51 2014 UTC,"the prime minister is a communist with ties to Russia from his old days  so I'm not to play the devil's advocate, however Slovakia is an extremely open economy with a lot of export oriented to the east.  The Ukraine crisis has a potential to have catastrophic consequences for Slovakia much more than for any other European country. Slovakia is dependent on imported gas and oil from Russia so I suppose the coming winter plays a role as well as last time Russia turned off the gas valve SK was scraping the bottom of the barrel to keep all it's people warm.   Slovakia has a lot of history with Russia and a lot to consider when approaching matters that concerns the relationships however it is not ""pro Russia"" whatever you think that means. Slovakia is a member of EU and, as unfortunate as it is coming from the clown the PM is, has the right to voice it's concerns the same way other countries do in matters they consider important.   I didn't have a chance to read into PM's reasoning, I'm hoping to hear at least from the new president as he appears to be less east oriented then his useless predecessor who was as much of a communist as the PM is."
Slovakia,2f4oy1,thekingestkong,8,Mon Sep 1 03:03:31 2014 UTC,"It's all true. I think the SK strategy should be to align itself closely with EU and NATO no matter the cost but there's no wide agreement on this, people vote for opportunists and populists, also Russia has its agents here.  Also SK is not alone in its stand, there is Hungary, Czech PM Sobotka said the same thing and I read about other countries' objections.  There's also a chance that a part of what Fico and Sobotka said is true, our economies might get hurt, Russia's economy is already hurt but there's no effect on the ukrainian conflict.  Bottom line still being that our elected representants side eith Russia."
Slovakia,2f4oy1,grumbal,3,Mon Sep 1 08:40:50 2014 UTC,Many thanks.
Slovakia,2f4oy1,thekingestkong,2,Mon Sep 1 07:28:15 2014 UTC,the prime minister is a communist   I find it misleading to call somebody  who works in accord with big employers and oligarchs a communist. ;)
Slovakia,2f4oy1,Pascalwb,4,Tue Sep 2 08:13:50 2014 UTC,Slovakia is an extremely open economy with a lot of export oriented to the east.   Less than 4 percent of our exports are going to Russia. Source <-> Source2.
Slovakia,2f4oy1,kzr_pzr,2,Mon Sep 1 20:01:59 2014 UTC,that's why I said to the east
Slovakia,2et8um,furnicul,7,Thu Aug 28 10:55:01 2014 UTC,"IANAL but I have been through this type of experience, in the same way - at the end of the original contract, probably because the original contract was set up by a professional real estate agency, and now you're dealing directly with the lunatic who happens to own the property.  Slovak courts are notoriously inefficient. You can try suing, but even if you have some friends in high places, it will still take years and then probably get thrown out.  It almost sounds like this guy is simply losing his mind. Is he very old? He's not demanding any more money from you since the increased utility payment? BTW, that's a huge lie about the utility bill. He just wants to steal some money from you to cover his costs for future repairs to the apartment. Don't be surprised if he claims you did lots of damage to everything inside the place.  I also had a landlord become disgustingly rude, even making hideous comments about my girlfriend right in front of my GF's father, who was trying to help me calm the waters with the landlord. I ended up just packing up and leaving without telling them, which led to them sending me text messages threatening to have me deported (I'm American), to have my bank accounts blocked, and to have INTERPOL hunt me down. Now, do you really think Interpol's main focus is settling rent disputes? Of course not. Slovak landlords seem to think they can bully people into anything. I was half expecting them to send Batman after me next....  The truth is landlords are living in the same system you are. They know the courts won't do anything to help them. And especially if you're EU citizens, you have absolutely nothing to worry about legally. If the landlord had any legal way to get anything from you, why would he bother getting all upset and bullying you? He is only bullying you because he believes he can.   My landlord went completely insane on me, and her quiet, warm-hearted husband suddenly joined her in berating me too, once this issue of money came up. But they demanded I pay something like 50,000 US dollars. If I'd had that much money, I could have bought their little dilapidated apartment TWICE! They seemed to think that because I was American, I must be rich like Brad Pitt. So I believe Slovak landlords see anyone west of them as very wealthy. They probably think you don't value money and they can squeeze some out of you if they make your life difficult.  Bottom line, don't appease and don't bother talking with them anymore. Just cut them out of your life. There's nothing else you can do. But there's nothing else they can do to you, either."
Slovakia,2et8um,gadelat,2,Thu Aug 28 12:47:05 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!   probably because the original contract was set up by a professional real estate agency, and now you're dealing directly with the lunatic who happens to own the property.   I think this is exactly the case, we rented the apartment trough an agency. Now it makes sense why he doesn't want to make a new contract, probably he doesn't even know how.  Yeah, he is old and he is just rude, like ... I don't know how to explain, the type of rudeness that is not based on anything, every time he feels my questions are too legitimate he starts screaming and calling me names. But, as I said, we are living there without a contract for more than 1 year. We plan to just get up and leave the day we find something else and just let him get angry. I suppose if he tries to go to court he then has to explain why he didn't pay any taxes on the 650 he was receiving every month (and we have bank statements that we were sending the money to the same account).   Sucks to hear what you went trough ... it seems worse than our situation, hope you're cool now"
Slovakia,2et8um,gadelat,1 point,Thu Aug 28 13:27:34 2014 UTC,"I was mostly furious that they insulted my lovely GF, but this was several years ago, so now I just think it's hilarious that they thought I even had 50,000 to give them, and that they thought I would throw a huge pile of money at them just because they screamed at me. Seriously, if I was so rich, why did I choose to live in a crumbling 320/month flat in Ruzinov? Old folks are just desperate. It's sad, but I'm not the one who can help them.  But at least I never had any electricity go out. Why have you even stayed there this long? No electricity = not livable. It's not a campsite, right?"
Slovakia,2et8um,grumbal,2,Thu Aug 28 14:14:32 2014 UTC,"I was wondering, how the hell did they reach such a huge amount, 50K ... wtf? Did you break away one wall and throw it out the balcony or something?  But yeah, I am sure our landlord will also ask for a ton of money when we just get up and leave"
Slovakia,2et8um,ulpianus,1 point,Thu Aug 28 14:18:23 2014 UTC,"I have no idea. They walked around pointing at every speck of dust in the apartment and said things like, ""oh look - this is discolored. Oh, here's a scratch."" although I couldn't even see any discoloration or scratches. They were just making things up. And the apartment hadn't been renovated - ever. It was honestly all original from the time of Stalin. When I moved in, the couch was already all torn up, for example, but they claimed it was nice before I got there. So they said I had to buy them a brand new couch, and then suddenly I had ""destroyed the bathroom"" and they would need to remodel it entirely... you can see, it just escalated into ""buy us a whole new apartment."" They clearly thought I was a secret millionaire, but one with no ability to defend myself against a scheme so clever as theirs."
Slovakia,2et8um,kochichka,2,Thu Aug 28 14:30:18 2014 UTC,"Oh my, that's just ridiculous ... but I see it happening to us too :) Are you still in Bratislava or moved back to US?"
Slovakia,2et8um,gadelat,1 point,Thu Aug 28 14:41:10 2014 UTC,"I have since spent a few years in China, and now I'm in the US. But if I found a good opportunity, I would go back to SK right away. I'm sure I'll end up back there someday, maybe for good."
Slovakia,2et8um,bajaja,0,Thu Aug 28 16:19:17 2014 UTC,"Great post, but please don't generalize"
