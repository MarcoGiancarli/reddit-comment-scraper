I was more worried because I've only caught 1 other cakeday and it wasn't updating for me. I didn't want to miss 3 of 4 cakedays.  But it's all good now. And I am satisfied.

Instead of soundbites, this community-with all if it's quirks and flaws, are really what i envisioned the internet to be about: small and large communities where we all share information.   I hope you have good experiences here, and may i suggest: explore subreddits with 200,000 subscribers or less. You tend to have more of a sense of  community than with the defaults."
