I bet that if they just put in 48fps and didn’t tell anyone it would have much better reviews from people who bashed it for not being cinematic 24fps.  Also, 48fps was great but The Hobbits production wasn’t up to it. I think you need to rethink the way you dress, make-up, direct, frame and everything.

explainlikeimfive,3e1hl2,cannibalismo,108,Tue Jul 21 09:15:06 2015 UTC,"I'll take a crack at trying to explain this a bit better.  DASH is a system that lets multiple different ""qualities"" all exist in the same ""stream"" (kind of, this is all very simplified). So what happens is first a 480p stream might start, and you will get 10 seconds of that buffered, then it will decide to upgrade you to 720p, and that will start buffering from a point which it will decide so that playback isn't interrupted.  The grey bar only shows the lowest quality stream. So while you may have 30 seconds of 480p video buffered, you may only have 9 seconds of 720p video (which starts 3 seconds from now), and beyond that you may have 3 seconds of 1080p video starting to buffer as well (basically 12 seconds out). So if you click in any parts that don't have the 1080p stream (since you were just upgraded to that, it is what the browser knows is your ""optimum"" streaming rate), you will have to re-buffer that data (for the first time).  Now imagine you are at 1080p in a video, and you want to go back 10 seconds. You may not have had 1080p at that point in the video, so it will need  to re-buffer that 1080p (again, that it may have never actually downloaded in the first place).  So there are very few places that you actually have the video you are watching cached because DASH playback is optimized to have to send as little of it as possible to save on both your and Youtube's bandwidth.  Edit: to expand, DASH can potentially have MANY different qualities in between the ones you can choose, so there could potentially be 5 720p ""qualities"" that can be adjusted constantly.  Edit 2: Nuked all my comments, y'all are a bunch of angry motherfuckers!"
explainlikeimfive,3e1hl2,Klathmon,9,Tue Jul 21 12:58:27 2015 UTC,"You would think it would start playing the bad quality stream then, but even if the gray bar goes from start to finish it rebuffers, or if I rewind back on a portion I have already looked at it might rebuffer. It's just weird."

explainlikeimfive,3e1hl2,cannibalismo,152,Tue Jul 21 14:46:10 2015 UTC,"Another way to get around the re-buffering is to switch to the HTML5 player on YouTube.

explainlikeimfive,3e1hl2,noobzilla,9,Tue Jul 21 14:49:27 2015 UTC,"There are millions of videos, but a much smaller amount of ads. Your internet service provider (ISP) gets the video and sends it to you. When enough people request the same video in a small enough amount of time your ISP desires that instead of getting a new copy of the video each time someone wants it they will keep a copy and send that to people instead, this is called caching the video. Because there is a much smaller amount of ads, and an ad can play at the start of many videos an ad is requested much more often than the video. Your ISP sends you the cached copy instead of getting a new copy of it again, as a result loading the ad is much faster than loading the video as it can go directly from them to you instead of having to wait on YouTube to send it to them. If enough people are watching the same video the video will get cached too.   This is a pretty simple explanation, but it pretty much covers it."

This process may have started 5 seconds into the video, but in an attempt to avoid interrupting your playback it starts loading the 720p video from the 20 second mark. If you happen to skip forward within that 20 second window of 480p video, it will attempt to load the video from that point in 720p, thus resetting the buffered video. This is a side effect of YouTube's adaptive streaming. Hope this answers your question!"

If the observed behavior is obviously wrong, then someone fucked up. If (Not meaning to claim that this actually works, but I guess so.) you can open a YouTube link, let it cache completely, cut your Internet connection and watch the video completely, then it's completely retarded coding if clicking somewhere on the position bar requires new caching.  Take Portal 2 by Valve, for example: The volume sliders don't work properly, just like in almost all other games. They obviously manipulate the audio in a linear fashion, which is not how acoustics work. When you reduce the volume down from 100%, you hear almost no change until you're at about 60%.  Some games do this correctly by raising the user's input value (From 0 to 1.) to the power of Euler's Number (about 2.7) or something like that.  Valve's developers sure should know this better, no? And hence the perception of all users is wrong. Is that really how you think?"

But forgetting about kinda minor issues, I think the whole of Portal 2 is amateurish because of Valve's inability to solve the major gameplay problem of difficulty levels (for which there are a number of easy solutions), instead -- according to the commentary -- deciding to dumb down every puzzle so that even their very least tenuous playtesters could walk through it."

One chunk is loaded and the loading/network performance monitored: if the speed turns out to be enough for the next higher quality setting, the subsequent chunk will be loaded at that higher quality setting. This is why on some occasions you might see a video starting out at very low quality and improving as you go along.  This also has the benefit of stopping the loading/buffering process when the video is paused and in general of reducing the load for YouTube.  The downside of course is that folks with a slower connection can't decide to manually set the quality to a higher level than what they'd be able to achieve normally and let the video buffer."

With the advent of HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) and DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP), most on demand videos are actually played back in the same manner as livestreaming.  The browser receives a manifest of all the chunks of video (usually 2-10 seconds in length each) along with different resolutions for each chunk. The player then loads the current chunk + a few more in advance but will not download the entire list. Previously it was one big video file and the browser would happily load the entire file.

explainlikeimfive,3e14vs,thesweetestpunch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:02:50 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily toxic, but indirectly, yes. CO will react with OH in the atmosphere, creating CO2 (carbon dioxide). More CO2 in an uncontrolled environment can be hazardous to plants. (While I'm here, the lack of OH for methane to combine with increases the concentration of methane in the air, contributing to global warming). Too high a concentration of CO2 causes a reduction in photosynthesis in certain plants, and of course increase the temperature calls for the need of more water. While it's true that global warming causes storms, this can cause flooding. A new study also shows that increased CO2 makes it more difficult for wheat to convert Nitrate to protein. It is expected by 2050 there will be a 14 percent increase in lead and an eight percent drop in the iron content of the crop. Nitrogen won't help as a fertiliser though for long, though, as while it does improve quality of the crop it's not cost effective and can produce Nitrous Oxide, a strong greenhouse gas.  source 1 source 2source 3"

explainlikeimfive,3e14vs,squeryl,42,Tue Jul 21 09:46:22 2015 UTC,"Couple of reasons.   If you've been to a commercial fruit orchard, you'll have noticed the trees are often not that attractive. They're pruned to keep them small - to produce good fruit you don't want the tree expending effort in growing too large. You want that energy going into the fruit (and also so that you can reach the fruit, it's no good if it's 10 metres up! You want small, productive trees). As a result, they don't provide good shade or look overly attractive. For the same reason, a good fruit tree requires quite a lot of tending and training, which requires the city to spend more on landscape and gardening services. Depending where you are, you may not want to eat the fruit. If it's in a park, yeah okay. If it's on a busy roadside, the tree will be sucking in the air, which will include relatively high concentrations of exhaust fumes. Obviously CO2 is photosynthesised out, but the air will contain all sorts of other nasties such as Sulphur Dioxide and various Nitrogen Oxides which the tree has no method of dealing with. Those toxins will actually then concentrate in the fruit.   Moreover, if not washed, the fruit will most likely be coated in particulate emissions (i.e. soot).  So yeah, you'd ""solve"" your homeless problem by slowly subjecting them to heavy metal poisoning...  Point 3 obviously depends very much on the placement of your trees, air quality of the city, proximity to exhaust sources, etc. Might be a problem, might not be."

We must consider, though, that cities are a more difficult place to grow. As humans have recently tipped the scales to become a more urban than rural species, we are not nurturing the ideal environment to grow food. However, there are potential solutions, and they start from the ground up. Vertical gardens, planters out front with veggies for the public, creating a group to talk to neighborhoods at a time and seeing how they could cumulatively create food for those passing by (i.e. a fruit tree each, harvest and share in baskets by the street) & taking over vacant lots with ""guerrilla gardening"" are all possible solutions.  In Chico, CA, what I presume were some guerrilla gardeners ended up putting kale and chard in the various street planters in the downtown area.

Any remaining profits could go to a 'help the homeless' fund that actually improves people's lives by paying for apartments and other things, and part of the requirement of taking on the contract for the picking / manufacturing, would be that you have to work with the city social workers in trying to place homeless people that want to work and get back on their feet.  So you have a work placement program, you have a fund to help the homeless get homes, you get a new 'City Jam', and you get more people interested in participating in the community because the only way to buy it is to go to the city functions.   Or... someone could lease the little bits of land from the city, plant berry bushes, pick the berries and keep things clean and tidy, make jam (or pies or whatever), sell those things to everyone nationally, and make a bunch of cash."

If you fly very quickly North or South, you will carry the East/west momentum of the ground from where you started, which is different from where end up. Thus, you have some East/west movement relative to the ground there.  This explanation is not the best way to think about things if you want to do actual math with them (you want to use angular momentum), but I found it instructive when I heard it.

In addition, you'd have to aim higher or lower depending on the degree to which you were facing east or west.

The surface movement relative to your finger changes when your finger moves over the axis."

While the Earth itself is rotating at a constant rate, the rateof rotation at 5m from the North pole is less than the rate of rotation at the equator. As the bullet is hurtling through the air, the ground below it is rotating slightly quicker than the rotation in the spot that the bullet was fired from, causing it to ""drift""."

It is a curve in relation to the curve of the earth, making it more significant the further away the target. As a result, as it gets further away the influence gets stronger and the travel time increases creating a compounding issue.   Simply put, if you stand at a reference point and someone is in front of you, standing just a few feet away for all practical purposes they are moving 'straight ahead'. If they are 90deg off east/west of you they are moving entirely vertically from your reference."
explainlikeimfive,3e0zfl,tsnives,3,Tue Jul 21 10:40:06 2015 UTC,"And you probably never will. For one, your throw isn't an accurate enough setup to observe the coriolis effect. You'd have to build a device to launch the object directly upward, and have it be small enough that air movements don't push it around at will. Second, part of the reason the effect is apparent to snipers is because of the distance the bullet travels, and the great precision which they must maintain. If the object you're throwing shifts a millimeter, that shift extrapolated over the hundreds or 1000+ yards the bullet travels would be equal to several centimeters. The coriolis effect occurs because the earth is curved. Unless you travel a significant distance over the surface, you're not covering enough curvature for the effect to be noticeable. Your test with throwing things straight up covers no distance over the curvature of the earth, so it will be effectively unnoticeable. The best way to see it for yourself is to go shooting, or watch a video about it on youtube."

explainlikeimfive,3e0zfl,FelixMontague,0,Tue Jul 21 08:38:05 2015 UTC,"That's not the Coriolis effect.  The Coriolis effect is more accurately termed Coriolis acceleration. It is the acceleration a body will experience as it moves away from the radius of a rotating object.   Imagine yourself standing at the center of a big CD. Now imagine you're walking towards the edge. With each step, you reach a part of the CD that is moving faster. Therefore, you must also have accelerated. That's Coriolis acceleration.  A bullet does not experience Coriolis acceleration because it is not attached to the earth. Coriolis acceleration will influence the position of the target relative to the shooter, however. But this effect is minimal.  If you'd like, I can show you the calculations, but let's say you have a sniper in the northern hemisphere at an altitude of 100m firing south a distance of 1 mile. Over that distance, the sniper must aim about a foot east of his target to make a perfect shot. Over that mile distance, atmospheric changes will render compensating for Coriolis acceleration pointless.  Snipers adjusting for Coriolis acceleration is a myth."

explainlikeimfive,3e0zfl,Jonno26,17,Tue Jul 21 08:45:34 2015 UTC,"This isn't because of drop. This is because the scope is above the barrel. The line of sight of the scope and the trajectory of the bullet meet at the range that the rifle is ""zeroed."" At ranges that are less than the zero, the trajectory of the bullet is moving upwards, towards the line of sight primarily due to the angle of the barrel vs the angle of the scope. Farther than the zero  and the trajectory is moving down due to gravity.  If you put the barrel of a rifle against the wall and look through the scope, the scope is going to be pointed at a spot on the wall that is above the barrel."

explainlikeimfive,3e0zfl,PPCLI_OR_DIE,47,Tue Jul 21 17:31:21 2015 UTC,"Snipers do alot of math.  But they do most of it at the practice range.    When out in the field, you spend alot of time figuring out the range of various objects.    Knowing how much to aim up becomes a matter of memory and educated guessing.  Elevation is almost always recreatable.   Windage is a best guess because you don't have accurate measurements 100 yards distance, but you can see the effects and take a good guess.     Bullets don't travel in straight lines.    In best case no wind conditions, its an arc, just like a baseball thrown from outfield to home base.    The outfielder knows from practice and thousands of throws that if he's at the wall and throws it at X angle elevation, it will reach the second baseman at Y yards away  without hitting the ground.    A sniper knows by shooting the bullet at X angle elevation, it will fall down and hit where the crosshairs are calibrated at Y yards away.     But if target is not at Y yards, but Y+100 yards, the shooter needs to either adjust the scope calibration by 100 yards, or aim high by a specific amount.      Windage is for compensation crosswind or headwind.  It can be full sideways or blowing full on you, or somewhere in between.    It can blowing multiple directions at once.      The shooter had to know thru practice, how much to adjust and when to adjust."

For a number of reasons (protection, calculation) but also because snipers just don't hit first time!  99% of sniping isn't trying to assassinate a VIP 7 miles away who will duck into a nuclear bunker at a moment's notice if you don't peg him in the eye first time.  Snipers in theatre shoot at targets like machine gun emplacements or mortar operators or even equipment to wreck it (anti-materiel shooting). The target isn't going to immediately hide for ever if you miss first time as they are typically embattled themselves anyway or at least firing at something they want to keep firing at.  The sniper and spotter do their calculations, the sniper fires, the spotter watches for the impact which could be anywhere nearby and tells the sniper how to adjust, like an artillery spotter saying ""drop 200 metres"" or whatever based on the first barrage landing, in that instance, 200 metres behind the target. They make their best go of it first shot but if they miss, the spotter who is watching the area of the target advises adjustments based on where the shot lands. The sniper still has to be a superlative marksman for the shots that miss to tell the spotter anything about where the next will land with adjustment."

explainlikeimfive,3e0zfl,5654632564,23,Tue Jul 21 08:36:16 2015 UTC,"Here's a great answer by /u/holdoffhathcock:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3djsya/soldiers_of_reddit_what_is_something_you_wish_you/ct68lra?context=3   You have to memorize a truly, truly exhausting amount of information and be able to make calculations on the fly. You'll probably carry a calculator wherever you go as well as a little notebook full of tables. Some guys glue their notes to the stock of their rifle.  Look at the problem of putting a bullet on target at 300-400 meters, which is a little bit longer than a city block. At that distance, it's more or less point of aim point of impact, which means you don't have to do any adjusting, just point and shoot, pow. Past 500 meters, things start getting fun, and past 800 is basically magic. At that range, you're not pointing your rifle at the target. At that range, you're aiming at the air above it and somewhat off to the side. A bullet doesn't arc up and down like a basketball.  Gravity pulls down on the projectile as soon as it leaves the barrel. Air resistance pushes against the projectile, slowing it and sloughing it off to the side. The density of the air does the same thing, and makes the curve more lopsided and steep. How high above sea level you are has a huge effect on the path of the bullet, at higher altitudes, the projectile will travel farther and faster. Humidity has to be accounted for, for the same reason. Temperature, not only the ambient temperature but the temperature of the propellant in the ammunition you're loading. A bullet that has been warmed in the sun is going to hit about 20 inches higher at 1000 meters than a cold bullet. The rifling spins the projectile, at a 12 inch twist it will make a full rotation once for every 12 inches of travel. This means at 1000 meters it's going to spin about 3600 times, and the spin makes it drift to the side, sort of like a curveball if you like baseball comparisons. Are you aiming uphill or downhill? Aiming downhill you'd probably guess you need to aim a little lower, and you'd be right. But you also aim low while firing up-grade.  That's all math, that can be accounted for and adjusted for pretty simply with practice. It's wind. Wind is the motherfucker. A soft breeze will push you way off target when you're shooting out past 500 meters. But, when the projectile travels past 500 meters, the air it travels through isn't going to be the same that whole way down range. Think about the way a bird floats on swirls of hot air, and imagine trying to make a bullet travel a straight line through a whole series of those. Maybe where you're standing the wind is 3.5mph traveling north. Well, 300 meters out the wind is pushing in the opposite direction. 500 meters out it's blowing harder. 800 meters out there's dead air, and at 1200 meters there's a draft off the side of a tall building. There's no way to account for that, so you learn to scan your environment and make educated guesses. Watching the way dust and trash blows down the street, and watching the way laundry flutters while it dries on a balcony. Watching the direction grass and trees are bent in the breeze. You have to visualize this bizarre corkscrew of wind patterns that you want to shoot through.  You're still not done! Have you fired your rifle recently? Because a clean cold bore shot will come out slightly different than a warm shot, after the inside of the barrel gets coated with copper from the path of the bullet. You're constantly zeroing your weapon, finding out how it digests different loads of ammunition at different temperatures. And again, the temperature of the bullet is going to affect the path.  So we'll take a shot at 1250 meters. Pretend we're using an M24 with M118LR cartridges that came from a cool, dry place. You know your zero, you crank the bullet-drop compensator as high as it will go, to 1000 meters, calculate the ballistic correction for the extra 250 meters, which is probably going to be another good 9 feet, so you'll hold off using the dots on your reticle, which means you're aiming with the little dots below the crosshair instead of dead center. Slightly off to the side to compensate for the spin you know is happening, and what you guess is sort of going to happen when the wind throws it off balance. You're ready, you pull the trigger.  In the space between pulling the trigger and the propellant igniting, which is 22/1000th of a second, the average walking pace puts a person an inch away from where they were when you fired. If they're running, they move about two inches. For simplicity's sake, let's pretend your target isn't moving. 1250 meters is far enough for a bullet to float above the ground for several seconds, which means the earth rotates underneath the projectile and causes it to hit off-center even more than if it weren't beaten by wind, cutting through the air, fighting humidity, and everything else.  After all that, it's going to be an absolute miracle if you hit your target on the first shot. You're probably going to miss. Luckily, you have a spotter who can watch the path of the projectile and tell you exactly what adjustment to make before firing again. You're almost always going to fire two or three times at extreme distances before you actually hit what you're aiming at. But ""sometimes one shot, sometimes one kill"" doesn't look as cool on a t-shirt."

Yes, math is a part of it. Most of the math involves elevation and bullet drop. Trial and error is also a big part of it, at least for me because I'm bloody casual.   Bullets don't really ""fly"" through the air the way people think they do. The instant they leave the barrel, they start to drop down towards the earth. It's like when you throw a ball, except the bullet/ball is going super-sonic at 3300-ish feet per second. This dynamic is rather uncreatively called ""Bullet drop"".   This means that in the short time between the bullet leaving my barrel, and the bullet hitting the target, gravity will have affected it's path, at least a little bit. The way I compensate for the downwards pull of gravity is to aim my rifle a little bit upwards. The father out the target is, the more time gravity has to pull on the bullet, so the higher I have to aim. We refer to this aiming above the target as ""elevation"".   My rifle, a .223 with a 20"" barrel, has it's sights set up so that I don't need to make any adjustments at 100 yards. This would be called the ""zero"" point of aim. Anything beyond 100 yards requires be to raise my sights, at least a little bit, in order to have a chance of hitting the bullseye."

explainlikeimfive,3e0zfl,spiderk132,3,Tue Jul 21 17:32:33 2015 UTC,watched the video. is it true that barrels are pointed slightly upwards to compensate for gravity like the video said? there was inconclusive debate in the comments.
explainlikeimfive,3e0zfl,McHammered__,5,Tue Jul 21 07:01:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, most barrels are pointed slightly upwards in relation to where the sights on the rifle point.   This causes two points (zeros) where the trajectory of the bullet and the sights line up. These are called the Zero 1 (Close point) and the Zero 0 (far point). This is because the bullet will rise a few points above the Zero 1, and then fall back down to the Zero 0. It's a parabolic arch between the two points. My own rifle has a zero 1 of about 25 yards and a Zero 0 of 100 yards.   My rifle has it's Zero 0 set at 100 yards; one football field's distance. That means that at ranges less than 100 yards, I need to aim low, to compensate for the bullet ""rising"" across my sights. At ranges longer than 100 yards, I need to aim high, to accommodate for additional bullet drop.   Keep in mind that we're talking about inches of travel here. Just because my gun might be aiming a bit high or low, doesn't mean I can't blast your face off at 300 yards distance. Modern rifles are accurate, even it imperfectly so."
explainlikeimfive,3e0zfl,_LogenNinefingers,2,Tue Jul 21 07:25:37 2015 UTC,"He answered your question already about barrel angle, but to add on, it's not at all noticeable if you're just looking at the gun. Also, guns are not designed with upwards pointing barrels, it's that the rear sight is raised.  He also mentioned a Zero 1 and a Zero 2. This is also known as a battlefield zero. US Army M16's are zeroed at 36yd, which, when combined with the M855 ammo (62 grain (4.017 gram) bullet being pushed at 3,100 fps or 940 meters per second) will also hit where you're aiming at 300yd. Notice how specific that is. There's lots of science, math, and memorization that goes into being a proficient marksman. So, at 36yd and 300yd, you'll be right on, but in between that, your bullet could be as much as 9 inches above where you're aiming.  My AR15 is set up with a 50 yard/225yd zero. In between 50yd and 225yd, the bullet will only rise about 2.5 inches above where I'm aiming. Since I don't usually shoot far, this works well for me."

Its really not complicated  if you gave me a Day I could teach you to hit man sized targets reliably, and repeatedly at 500 yards im sure even if you have never fired a weapon before. But Id have you spend about 500 rounds that day. I have some nifty targets and exercises.   you just start out with a rifle and a projectile load that is consistant and work on fundamentals with every ...shot. Then you learn how sight adjustments work.   I tell people not to worry about precision. that mainly comes from your optics and sights. What we care about are good GROUPS. you can be off target by a mile (figuratively speaking), but if all your shots are hitting within a certain distance of each other ...you are a good shooter, you just have adjust the sights to move that group on target.   Math is important if you wish to be versatile. IE say you need to pick up a weapon on the field, that fires a different weight or charge. If you are well versed in theory you could be more effective.  But honestly ..you just shoot what you know and like, and stick to it.   I shoot 3MOA (1 Minute of Angle equates to 1 inch spread every 100 yards, so at 3 MOA Im getting 15 inch groups at 500 yards at riflemans cadence which is enough to engage targets in combat, but if I was hunting my shots would take a lot longer ..or id be using optics) with iron sights usually depending on the weapon (which isnt .....GREAT) and I am NO sniper. but with a magnifier and a 1moa dot instead of irons I can still get 5 inch groups at 500 yards from pretty much any weapon as long as the weapon itself is accurate to 1moa or less.   You just ...LEARN how to shoot it ....its more instinctive than anything. Any math you do is just going to be your own established tables, you know what weight bullet you are shooting, you have SHOT at known ranges ...so you know how many MOA is between one range and another with that bullet/weapon ...and its simple addition and subtraction.   Wind gets more complicated...I dont get into that."

Its a crazy process with lots that can go wrong.    1)FO has to find the target and plot it along with his own position. There is possibility of error here. Transmits info via a call for fire to the asset he needs.     2)the assets FDC recieves the call for fire then has to plot the target based on what the FO gives for coordinates. Then has to figure out how to get the specified round on the target and how long it will take. Converts that info to info the gun crews can use. Relays info to gun crews.    3)Gun crew adjusts their guns using the info provided by the FDC. And fire.    4)FO watches for impacts and adjusts back onto target, calling corrections back to the FDC.    That is very simplified basic version of what goes on. Its a lot more complicated. Gets more so for specialized missions like varying the sheaf, getting all rounds to hit at once or at a specific TOT. A moving target. Or a SEAD.    Its pretty crazy to think of how much is involved. How many things can go wrong, and how little margin for error there is. But more often than not a skilled observer can hit targets with ease. In my experience none of this process was computerized, its all by hand with plotting boards, maps, giant tomes of numbers, protractors, compass, binoculars , and mental math.    I have never seen the process realistically played out in any medium. PR2 is like a simplified version."

explainlikeimfive,3e0zfl,Bighungry1969,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:39 2015 UTC,"I graduated US Army sniper school in 1995, so some of the technology has advanced, but I can give you some quick answers.  Math is integral, but surprisingly the most important math you do does not involve the actual shot, but figuring out how far away the target is.  In school you are tested on 3 types of range estimation (once again, I went to the school in 1995 so some things may have changed). 1. Visually estimating the range.  Must be within 15% of the actual range.  Typically I used the football field method, which is you try to imagine football fields between you and a target to have a relateable distance.  This gets easy with practice. 2. With binoculars.  Must be within 10% of the actual range.  This method uses the tic marks on the lenses of the binos to use mils and the mil relation formula to figure the distance.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4WBR7hc8zQ   Explained here. 3. With the rifle scope.  Must be within 5% of actual distance. http://www.mil-dot.com/articles/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-mil-dot-reticle The math comes in when you have to figure the actual distance.  So as a sniper we tried to do this in advance and write out charts for various items so all we had to do was figure out how many mils a target was and look at the chart to find the distance.  For example, using the mil relation formula, using 2 meters for the height of a man (a little tall, I know, but easier for the math). 2 meters tall x 1000 = 2000 then divide by how many mils tall the person is in the scope, say 3 mils, that means the target is 666 meters away.  Here is a sample chart: http://www.primalrights.com/articles/rifle-sighting-systems-part-2-angular-mil (see middle of page) Generally we would make a chart for things like average height of a man, height of Soviet vehicles, door height in a specific part of the world, etc.  No apps for this back then.  The chart was the shortcut to save time when you were actually shooting.    There is math involved once you get the range and read the wind, but not while you are actually shooting.  Most of your data comes from you handy little sniper note book (dope book).  Those numbers are attained through countless days at the range under various conditions.  You record your cold bore shot (first of the day) as that is more likely than not going to be the shot that counts in combat, and a barrel has different harmonics when it is cold or hot.  You record the data for all this practice in your book and log it by range, and if possible, by conditions.  So for example: If you figure out the range of a target is 650 meters, you flip to the tab in your book that covers that range. you find a shot that as closely corresponds to the one you are about to take, and you take that ""dope"", or data, and use that to adjust the windage (left and right)  and elevation on your scope.  Your spotter is doing this for you by the way.  They also use the spotter scope to figure out wind or any other atmospherics that may affect your shot, and use that to determine if any other adjustments are needed.  Shooters treat a good spotter like a security blanket, they are very possessive of them.   You have to trust your spotter.  In school, you are paired up with the same spotter then whole time.  Then during final qualification, on your final shot, they take the spotter away and make you do all of your own adjustments under a time restriction (don't remember exactly what it was but 60 seconds sounds right).  One other place that requires heavy math is when there is a significant difference in elevation between you and a target.  I do not remember the exact equation on this, but the fact that you were more than about 30 meters higher or lower than a target was significant enough where it would throw your shot off enough to miss. We did not make any shots over 1000 meters (we did not have any Barrett rifles for training) so we did not deal with the rotation of the Earth, as that is primarily used for artillery type weapons.  Like I said it has been a couple of decades, but those are the main uses of math as a sniper."
explainlikeimfive,3e0zfl,Random_White_Guy_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:41 2015 UTC,"The shorter answer is no ; the equipment available to modern day snipers does the calculations for them and does not require them to actually calculate anything.  In several cases, the snipers will have spotters with a range finder which gives them the atmospheric pressure, wind speed, direction and distance, the sniper adjusts his equipment using those factors. Even if acting on their own, a sniper will have access to the equipment and their scopes/sights are made to help compensate for those factors.  As someone mentionned, do they know why they are adjusting the equipment, absolutely. Would they/are they able to calculate them manually, probably not but that's not an issue with today's techologies."

The shooting part is almost exclusively training, or if you're in real combat doing protection. (I have no idea what the SOF snipers are doing though)  Source: I was a sniper 8 years ago, during conscription service.

If they are looking through a hole and they elevate the gun to where it needs to be, they arent pointing at the target any more. If the hole is too small, it will be pointing at the wall instead.

If you lived in 1850 with your current set of morals, would you convict somebody for not returning a fugitive slave to his ""rightful"" owner? If not, would it be because of the injustice of the law, or merely because you wanted to disobey the judge's instrictions when he told you to uphold the law to the letter?"

explainlikeimfive,3dxsgq,delscorch0,3799,Tue Jul 21 04:15:09 2015 UTC,"They sometimes can potentially have their careers ruined. My father was a grand juror on the Sandusky case. He had to go to Harrisburg, PA 1 week out of every month for 18 months. This wasn't something he signed up for. He was one of the ones who randomly got picked for jury duty that just happened to be grand jury duty.  He received an award his first 2 years at his new job for being an exceptional manager and the award was for high productivity and effectiveness at his job. They didn't have any employees who qualified for the award for 2-3 years before my dad started working there. In his first 2 years there he received the award.   My dad would work extra hours to make sure things were good to go for the week he had to go to jury duty. Going in on the weekends, staying late during the weekdays, all without getting paid because he was salary. He busted his ass to make sure things were still running there up to his standard and even would tirelessly call work during breaks and after court to help wherever he could.   Towards the end of his jury duty he was noticing very unusual behavior from people he worked with. His boss was previously my dad's biggest fan. He loved the attention the plant was getting for running so well and loved that his plant had the employee who got the award. He started to turn cold towards my dad. As in ice cold, I barely know you, and avoiding my dad. My dad had to take multiple breathalyzer tests and drug tests from the plant's safety inspector. My dad said it wasn't just one or 2 but multiples of them. Even the safety inspector thought it was incredibly unusual and it became a joke. Whoever was making stuff up wanted to have my dad harassed and embarrassed with the hope of catching my dad doing something wrong. Well my dad never would dream of drinking on the job and he doesn't do drugs.   One day my dad goes into work on a Saturday. This was completely optional for him. He only went in on Saturday's to make sure nobody needed any last minute things for the day and to just generally have a presence to help out. My dad showed up 5 minutes after the official start time for the day. Which is no big deal. Like I said, optional day for him, he wasn't required to work Saturday's, and plus 5 minutes late wasn't a big deal either way. My dad said his boss fired him that day. Gave him multiple reasons for him being fired. My dad said he was throwing shit at the wall to see what stuck. When I asked my dad why he was officially fired he said he has no idea because his boss said 10 different things. They ultimately decided the reason my dad was fired, officially, was ""lack of productivity."" Which, if you were paying attention, is absolute bullshit. How can a guy go from being the first person in years to win the award for productivity company wide, 2 years in a row, then his third year is being told he is so unproductive that he needs to be fired.  My dad went to the DA in charge of the case. He told her the situation and she went to another lawyer involved with the case. That lawyer was furious about this situation. He said he will have a lawyer in his law firm represent my dad for free. The lawyers sued my dad's work. They went in and froze all communications via email, text messages, any recorded phone calls, any inter office messaging system messages, and even went as far as to freeze handwritten memos and even basic job reports. They caught my dad's boss referring to him as ""the professional juror"" and insults/slights along those lines. As if my dad wanted to be doing bullshit jury duty in the first place and listening to cases of grown men crying because someone who they thought was a father raped them when they were young really was tough on everyone involved.   In the end my dad won a pretty decent amount of money from the case. I don't know the ramifications for the boss/others involved but it was a win for my dad and family.   EDIT: I have edited my comment because there seems to be some confusion on what I meant in the second to last paragraph. Neither myself or my dad ever held the view that ""grown men crying"" was insignificant or somehow bad. What I meant to say was that not only did my father have to do bullshit jury duty, which everyone hates, he also didn't get an easy case. Instead he got a very heart wrenching case where a grown man in a father figure role abused children who thought he was their father to the point where they have been so deeply impacted that as adults they still feel the pain from this man. That hearing the details of the crimes, the impact it had on the victims, and hearing them retell their experiences was incredibly tough on him. Especially being a father himself who couldn't even imagine letting anything happen to his children. How someone can be so sick and twisted to do those things to a young child in their care really made the situation more difficult. It wasn't a grand jury case for someone who was committing fraud or a big drug dealer. It was one of this countries biggest child predator case and he got to hear all of the intimate details, hear from the victims, and actually see first hand rather than through a newspaper or tv screen. He got to see the victims, put a face to their names, and see how hurt they were.   I sincerely hope that anyone who mistook my comment as negative will read this edit and understand that I was not trying to call victims of sexual abuse and their feelings bullshit. This is my fault and I should have re-read my post more carefully to avoid confusing anyone. Especially with such a difficult time. Anyone who has suffered unfairly from sexual assault, I hope that my comment did not offend you or that if it did you read this edit and reply."

explainlikeimfive,3dxsgq,needanacc0unt,270,Mon Jul 20 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"I will be the first to admit that people from that general area can be very dumb with these situations. It's a small area and people in power positions at one of the places that provide a lot of jobs for the area, they tend to think that they are kings of the area. The area isn't on the ""national radar"" so to say. So these important people feel they have the influence and ability to overstep their power with little to no accountability. I am very sure that the boss knew that what he was doing was wrong. He just thought that he was above the law and nobody would care in such a small area or that nobody would make a big deal. I mean he even got other people he worked with to go along with it. You can't fire someone, especially a higher manager, without at least talking to other plant managers/board of directors. So this guy was able to influence them to take his side and use company resources to slander and get my dad fired. I can easily see where he thought that nothing would happen to him.  He certainty did not expect a lawyer from the state capital to take my dad's case for free and send his entire law firm after the company and seizing records. It was actually kinda cool.

I could never go back to living in a small town simply because of this. People got jobs at the hospital because of who their parents know. The football team won 3 games my entire career because the coach only played certain kids due to who their parents were. Hard work and being good at your job rarely resulted in promotions or better pay unless you knew someone or lived in the area your entire life. We moved to the area when I was younger and always felt like outsiders and were treated as such. The worst part of it all? The same people back-stabbing you, shit talking you, or promoting their friend's kid above you, are the same ones giving you the fake smile and ""How is the family doing?"" bullshit when you see them at the store. There is a big hospital in the area and I honestly don't know how they manage to function at the level they do with the amount of this type of shit going on there.

You get small town politics and some people who have power get delusional and think that since it's such a small area there is no spotlight on them and they can get away with it. I mean if you think about it, my dad was a higher level manager and was fired on bullshit terms. One person can't just decided to up and fire a higher level manager without consulting other managers and/or executive board. So the boss was able to convince even those people to go through with it. They even waited until after the jury duty was over to fire him so it didn't look like it was because of the jury duty. That's why the lawyers froze communications records.

They even tried to extend the jury duty because there was a DA that was murdered who was the first DA to try and take the Sandusky case. He was murdered and they found the DA's laptop in the river. They think the 2 are related. Thankfully it worked out in his favor. The DA in the case even said that this case would turn central PA and college football on it's head. It was very interesting to see it all played out. I think it's sad the way everything went down. My dad did say though that from everything he heard, including the secretly recorded tapes with sandusky and his wife meeting one of the victims, that there is no way Sandusky's wife didn't know. He also said he felt bad for mcqueary and that he was screwed either way. If he said something right away he would have been dragged through the mud and discredited to protect the program. He did what he did and you get everyone saying he should have done more. His only failure was his belief that the people above him would treat the situation as seriously as he did. Also, it's possible Paterno didn't know the exact extent of the abuse, but he was not nearly as in the dark as everyone thinks he was. But I mean you also have to look at the situation. Paterno was a figure-head coach in some aspects. He was a older guy who often had to ""coach"" games from the coach's box and I think he didn't even have the offensive coordination job towards the end. So I can see it that Joe heard rumblings but wasn't involved as seriously in the day-to-day of football therefore he wasn't necessarily that involved."

They were trying to get any indication that his boss had ill will towards my dad due to his jury duty and that it wasn't lack of productivity. If they did not freeze the records and see within them my dad's boss calling him a ""professional juror"" and other conversations involving his jury duty and his the way his boss felt about it then they probably would have had a harder time proving it. Probably since ""productivity"" is pretty subjective and it was a fact that my dad was not there for a week each month due to his jury duty responsibilities. In the end though they knew what they were doing, thankfully.  I hope you and your husband are doing well now. Did you contact anyone or get any help in the matter?

We were also paid but it was extremely minimal ($25 a day, IIRC + a little bit for transportation/parking). Employers did not, by law, have to pay us for jury duty but most did. I think only one person was not paid during that time and she ended up changing her shift around and working nights (which made staying awake during the trial very difficult, but she seemed to manage).   That said, the court did work hard to find a jury who could do 5-6 months duty without having a hugely detrimental impact on their lives (e.g. someone taking care of a parent with dementia was exempted etc..).

My job actually continued to pay me through my 10 days though.  EDIT: As pointed out, you can only claim up to what you would have earned anyway. So if you were unemployed, you don't get the full stipend, you would get the same job seekers allowance that you normally would get.

If that happened, instead of the school paying for the vast majority of her tuition and only charging us in-state rates for the remainder, it would be been zero reimbursement and out-of-state rates for the full tuition.

explainlikeimfive,3dxsgq,Guinness2702,55,Mon Jul 20 15:29:25 2015 UTC,"Well, jury selection varies depending on the jurisdiction.  My experience is in New York, and the basis for my knowledge is having tried about 60 jury trials, and selected about another 20 or so juries that ended up not going to trial.  In New York, jurors are paid $40/day for their service, and if called, are exempted from service for 6 years.  If they serve more than 10 days, they get 8 years exemption.  During jury selection, most judges will go through questions concerning certain ""hardships"", which are not necessarily automatic disqualifiers, but most judges will remove you if you fall into one of these categories.  The general categories are:   Medical - scheduled medical procedure that either can't be rescheduled or would be a hardship to reschedule Vacation - planned vacation with tickets/hotels/flights/etc PURCHASED (in other words, not just ""I was thinking of taking a trip"") Full time student with classes scheduled during the period of time the trial will occur Sole caregiver for a minor or elderly individual where it would be a hardship or impossible to arrange for alternative assistance EXTREME financial hardship.  This is where you are the sole proprietor of a business, work on commission, or otherwise wouldn't get paid if you don't go to work.  If you are an employee of a company that doesn't pay for jury duty (in my state, required to pay for three days, that's it - some companies cover more).  Key is ""EXTREME"", jury duty is an inconvenience for everyone, we just want to make sure you aren't going to lose your home or starve because of jury duty   I think those are the main ones, also there are a few automatic disqualifications - difficulty understanding the english language, medical issues that would prevent you from sitting on the case, blind/deaf, or difficulty seeing or hearing to the extent that you are missing stuff that's going on.  Felony convictions also disqualify you.  There are no automatic exemptions due to your profession.  Famously, Rudy Giuliani served on a jury when he was Mayor of NYC.  The Chief Judge of the NYS Court of Appeals was called and I believe she served.  I've been called a few times myself, never got picked though.  The types we get vary greatly - for very short trials almost everyone can serve.  For longer ones, of course we lose a lot of people.  I had one case that was expected to last for 4 months.  It took over two weeks to pick a jury, and we went through over a thousand jurors to get our panel.  I don't fault people for not serving when it will legitimately cause them an extreme hardship.  I do take issue with those who are able to serve but don't want to because it's an inconvenience.  Jury service is our civic duty, and without people willing to serve our system would collapse.  I try to speak with my jurors after trials and every single person who has ever served has told me they were glad they did it and that it was one of the most interesting things they've ever done.  I'll never forget one lady who served and told me after that it was an inconvenience to her, but she saw all the other prospective jurors giving excuses to get off and realized that it was an important obligation, so she stayed and she was glad that she did.  For anyone who gets called, I recommend serving if you are legitimately able to - it's your justice system, this is your opportunity to see how it works up close."

Now imagine I need a car that can fly, but there are no pedals or controls for the wings, only for steering and driving on normal roads.  What linux allows people to do, is customize the operating system. They can add in anything they want because Linux is GNU (open source and free to use software), so you can remove the gas pedal, brake pedal, and steering wheel, and add in only the features you need.  To do this is very complicated though, but it is possible if you put your mind to it and learn about programming.  The linux ""kernel"" is the base of the operating system, it can be changed to whatever you want it to be through coding it.  There are linux based programs that can be used to control remote controlled cars and airplanes, run security cameras, run a backup system for your home that all your devices connect to (http://www.freenas.org/) , etc.  Ubuntu, Mint, unity, etc are basically the ""mainstream"" desktop versions of linux, they are for people that want to use the linux operating system for free instead of paying for windows or macintosh.  It can be useful to use ubuntu or mint for a spare old computer, so that you don't have to go out and buy windows for it.  The only problem with linux is that it is usually incompatible with a lot of smaller programs (companies have done a lot of work to make it compatible with their programs!) and it can be challenging to get things to install and work properly, but once you have done it a few times you can basically think through and figure out almost any problems."

A distro (distribution) of Linux is the Linux Kernal (core of the OS) and then all the software that sits on top of it. A distro is not really a different operating system, just different combos of software preinstalled in an install image.   The reason there is so many flavors of Linux is because a lot of people like some aspects of a distro, but want to take it in another direction; so they fork the distro.

Obviously more frames means movement will look smoother, as there are more images filling in the movement of an object. It also makes the game controls feel more responsive, as there will be a smaller delay between you pressing a button until something happens on the screen.  60fps have been the standard for gaming for quite some time now. It's simply a better experience playing at 60. The controversy you have probably heard is that some games have locked the fps to 30 for various reasons. Sometimes it's because the game developer have tied the physics of a game to the frame rate (which means should you increase it the game would run a double speed) which is a just stupid thing to do in the first place. In other cases, often on consoles, the developer will try to up the graphics as much as possible to make the game look good, while sacrificing the frame rate as the console hardware is too weak to handle it.  Here is a comparison, make sure you are watching it in the highest quality else it wont be in 60 fps. You clearly see that the 60fps gives much smoother motion, especially if you look at the building and trees in the background."

explainlikeimfive,3e1xmq,LudicrousPlatypus,27,Tue Jul 21 09:27:56 2015 UTC,"Former Swiss resident here, British citizen now living in Germany.  All Swiss residents have to be covered by health insurance, and produce evidence of this to the local Gemeinde (the most local tier of government). If you don't buy insurance, they'll get it for you and get the (higher than getting it yourself) cost back off you. The market for insurance is very heavily regulated - insurers can't decline to cover you, and their profits are capped. Medical services are provided by a mix of private and state organisations, but there's no real distinction between private and public from the point of view of the user.  The average cost over the last few years is about CHF500 per adult per month - but this depends on how much copay you agree to. The minimum copay that that you'll pay in a year is CHF1000 (assuming you use medical services, of course). If your income is low, there's a sliding scale of Gemeinde contributions. Interestingly, it costs me almost exactly the same amount for health coverage in Germany, which given the astronomically-higher cost of living in CH, makes their system seem extremely good value.  Taxes are complex - there's federal, cantonal, local and church taxes, which all add up. As a non-Swiss citizen you're taxed higher, and it will be anything up to 35% of gross, depending where you live (Gemeinde taxes vary greatly - where I lived, it was the lowest in Canton Zürich at 75% of the ""index value"" - 2km away in Zürich Stadt, it was 150%).  The figure of 13.2% you've quoted seems low to me for an ""ordinary"" citizen, but would be perfectly achievable if you're got the wherewithal to pay for professional tax services.  The main reason why Switzerland has such fantastic infrastructure is quite simply that they're prepared to invest in it. Not just in building, but also in maintaining. Things are fixed well before they go wrong, and there's a lot of ""fail safe"" built-in. The roads are a good example - potholes just don't exist because the surfaces are monitored, and will be repaired well before the point where serious damage has occurred.  Don't get the impression that it's some liberal utopia, though - women couldn't vote until 1990 in one of the Cantons, and there's a real small-c conservative ethos in many aspects of life. But Switzerland is very definitely not a ""I'll do whatever the hell I like and screw the consequences for everyone else"" libertarian free-for-all. The Swiss are famous for their rules, but the rules tend to be there for very good reasons (don't make a noise after 10pm because people need to sleep; clean the communal laundry after using it because that's just polite etc etc)  Public transport is a good metaphor. It runs on the honour principle - there are no ticket barriers, but there are random checks. A standing joke among expats is that the first time you're caught you'll pay a small fine; the second time you'll pay a big fine; and nobody knows what happens the third time because no 3-times-fare dodger has ever been seen again.  That's partly a reflection of the Swiss character. It's a very, very ""local"" place, where a lot of native Swiss will spend their entire lives in the town or village where they were born, so if you're antisocial it's your own people you're harming. There's also a very strong ""for the common good"" ethos - it's expected, and people do, that you will take turns in clearing the snow from communal paths in winter.  As a society, it's largely run on an unspoken philosophy of ""leave the place/thing as you'd like to find it"".  Gun deaths aren't unheard of, and there have been cases of people running amok with assault rifles - but it's just not the kind of society where people get wound up to the point of reaching for a weapon.  In some respects, it's a very strong argument for the ""guns don't kill people, people kill people"" school of thought, but you need the ""right"" kind of society for that to be the control approach.   It would be very hard to impose the Swiss way of life onto elsewhere, because it's so bound up in the national character, the languages, the system of direct democracy and all the advantages of being one of the richest nations on the planet.  Most other cultures that I've experienced (particularly the UK and US) have an underlying streak of selfishness which would prevent the Swiss approach working very well.  Maybe you could describe it as ""the land of the free(dom to do stuff unless it upsets other people, in which case don't)""?"

They're very noisy, very wing-nut, and really not all that representative of the Swiss at large.  The social net is very localised (at the gemeinde level, which can be as few as 4000 or 5000 people).

explainlikeimfive,3e1xmq,bargeldlos,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:18 2015 UTC,"Swiss here, will try to answer as best as i can. historians and economists feel free to correct and add.  As to why these things are how they are, i guess the short answer is: it grew historically. through lessons learned. specifics a bit below  ""Best"" Healthcare:   Basic healthcare is available for everyone which is mandatory and covers most stuff. there are different insurances that supply this, but the basic cost and what is offered is the same. if you are poor the community will subsidise its monthly cost (around 2-300 usd per month). Now basic is really good enough. it covers almost everything except luxury things like choosing your own doctor, or private rooms, or homeopathic and alternative treatments. even rehab is covered.  As to why it became that way: this site here tells you more. translate with google (german to english). if something is unclear ask in the thread.  tl;dr: worker unions formed a basic health care early century following the industrialization. entrepreneurs made parallel organizations that merged..  http://www.geschichtedersozialensicherheit.ch/institutionen/krankenkassen/  Taxes:   Most of it does not come from the banks but rather from VAT. the rest of it i have to check out more. but we have a broad sector of high tech industry and a large size of small and midcap companies that practically have manufacturing monopolies (certain car sensors, etc...). source: finance statistics of the state, unfortunately only in german. but ask if you have any question.  http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/18/02.html  as to why they are so low:  0: high wages, due to us being a high tech country, yes we have banks, but not only. means in absolute terms we still pay a lot of tax, but relatively (%) it is low.   bookkeeping trick: if you add health care then the tax rate gets more normal. in germany and northern countries health care is directly added to taxes.   Edit: as u/simluk correctly mentioned: add pensions, unemployment (and other) insurances should be added here   (speculation on my part) Direct democracy plays a role. we regularly vote about laws (it is not a consultary vote), among others about how high the VAT is. we have a multiparty system where no party has an absolute majority, and laws can (and regularly are) be overturned by popular vote. leads to a more ""accountable"" government, also in terms of spending. low tax evasion. its a factor that is present in most northern countries.    Safety:   we are a small wealthy country with a broad middle class. why should you commit a crime there? our largest city has less than 1 million inhabitants. also lots of villages here  Gun laws: they are not as lax as you think: you have to have a chat with the local police before acquiring a gun. they will ask you why etc.. already this can be a high detterent for crime (lack of anonymity). also you are trained in the military service which is compulsory for males. Unfortunatly we are pretty high on gun related suicides :-(  Can it be replicated?  Good question. i guess for a big country like the us, you would have to adopt the model of the EU (everyone has a say, multiple parties).  which is not without its problem and needs time.  tl;dr: a small country with only 6 million   Edit: 8-9 million  people and almost no resources and harsh winters: we needed to get along...

Most social scientists (outside the US) ascribe the prevalence of gun related to deaths to a) availability of arms, and b) a culture of fear.  Availability of arms - this is simple, the large scale availability of semi and fully automatic weapons is a large part of the problem.  Other countries might have similar levels of availability, but they also have regulation.  So in Australia you can often get a gun license, but you'll need to apply and wait for approval.  Then you'll need a gun cabinet to store them in (because why would you leave a gun lying around the house, or in a shoebox).  And finally, you have to have a better reason for having a bigger gun. The level of gun regulation in the US is stupid.  There is none (comparatively).  There is no reason why the average citizen should carry a semi or auto, and that has compromised the ability of the police force to effectively police.  That's why there are so many cop related killings - any American police would be a fool to assume a perp is not carrying a gun when they're so damn easy to buy.  Cultural issues - Michael Moore tried to address this in his movie which I forget the name of.  In short, the US lives in a perpetual state of fear.  There are a number of contributing factors, such as the availability of guns, the cultural baggage of being the global hegemon, military-politico-industrial lobbying, and so on.  Basically, US citizens think that peace is won at the end of a barrel. Someone breaking into your house? Shoot them.  It is very rare to find an American that owns a gun and doesn't justify it in the name of self defence.  Bu the problem is that they aren't used that way.  The situation is currently so bad that, should America reform it's gun control system (which they won't/can't) the problem would exist for another 100 years. However...  When Australia reformed its laws it offered an amnesty on handing over illegal and overpower fire arms.  Since their reforms there have been NO mass shootings.  They Australian govt hasn't said people can't have guns. They've simply said that people need to apply, and if they are a risk then they can't have a gun.  Further, no one needs an AK47 for anything, not any other overly powerful gun.

explainlikeimfive,3e2lxz,perceptio15,3,Tue Jul 21 14:01:50 2015 UTC,"To understand what an overtone is, you first have to understand a bit about waves.  I'll get to how this applies to physical instruments in a second, but for the sake of explanation, I'm going to talk about waves in the general sense.  Every possible wave form (square, triangle, saw, etc.) can be reduced to the sum of a bunch of sine waves of varying frequency and amplitude. In fact, for many purposes -- electronics, light, and hearing included -- every type of wave really IS nothing more than a bunch of sine waves.  So, the simplest answer to your question is that an overtone (or harmonic) is simply one of the waves that makes up the waveform an instrument or vocalist emits.  This property of waves means that filtering out all waves above a given frequency will change the timbre (character) of notes whose root frequency is actually below that frequency.  For example, if you have a filter which filters out all tones over 800hz, and you play middle C on an electric piano through it, it will not sound normal, even though middle C is supposedly below the range of the filter.  Likewise, it's possible to cancel out the root tone and just hear the harmonics.  This is how saxophonists play notes that are way above the traditional range of the instrument, and what happens when you lightly touch an electric bass string after playing it.  This is also why phones make people sound weird, they cut off high tones in order to put more than one conversation on the same line.  So, how are harmonics created?  Extremely transparent synthesizers create each of them manually. (If this has interested you so far, check out the operator tool in ableton live, you can manually select the level of each harmonic, and explore their effects.)  In stringed instruments, it's very easy to visualize.  Basically, when you pluck a string, the whole string vibrates.  Each half of the string also vibrates creating a harmonic of double the root frequency.  Each quarter then vibrates, and so on... Wind instruments work in much the same way, except it's harder to visualize, and the shape of the instrument cancels out certain harmonics."

First, only overtones which are a multiple of the root frequency are considered to be harmonic, correct? So for instance if the frequency is 200hz then harmonic overtones would be 400hz, 600hz etc.--and then instruments which have overtones which are not multiples of the root frequency such 350hz, 650hz, etc., when the root is still 200hz-- these are ""inharmonic"" overtones, right?  Second question: what is going on when multiple singers are singing, say, in an a capella group for instance, and there are apparently notes heard higher than what's being sung. Is this just overtones with multiple voices or is there a different phenomenon at play here?"

explainlikeimfive,3e2mfy,camsprouse,6,Tue Jul 21 14:12:36 2015 UTC,"Here's how it started:  America is big.  Like, really fucking big.  So when the internet (or electricity, or telephones) came along, the idea of building a public infrastructure across the entire country was simply not feasible. so the government gave private companies money to build the infrastructure themselves.  Part of the agreement was that the companies own the lines they are running the data on.  Once built, these companies have a monopoly on the area, since they exclusively own the data lines, and no competitor can feasibly build a competing network without government help.  In short, the startup cost is too high to enter the market(unless you're Google).  So all the major telecom companies just divided up the country, took their share, built their networks, and charged whatever they wanted.  By staying out of each others areas, they don't have to compete with each other, causing price drops, higher speeds, and other stuff that would generally help consumers.  The government took action to protect consumers with public utilities, to the point that they limit pricing and allow things like buying power from a company with a better rate in the area, even though you're really getting it from the other guy.  There's another good reason for this; it prevents competing networks, like multiple power and water lines coming into your house from competitors.   As of yet, high speed data has not been deemed a public utility like power, water, and sewage.  So the telecom companies still have exclusive access to their lines, exclusive access to the poles the lines are on, and basically a monopoly on the entire business.  Without competition, there's no reason to innovate or provide good service.  Expect this to change in the near future.  Google fiber is a hit pretty much everywhere it's gone so far, though getting it through bureaucracy has been a challenge.  Comcast has lowered prices and increased speeds in areas Google fiber has spread to, so the competition is helping.  The FCC just passed laws preventing ISPs from bandwidth throttling and allowing them to regulate pricing should it be deemed ""too much,"" whatever that means.  However, the ISPs still own their own lines, and they have bought many congressmen (and potential presidential candidates) through lobbying to try and keep them from being regulated.

It was started by the Labour gov Back in 09 or 10. We were supposed to get fiber to the premises with up to 100mbps down speeds. It was going to cost $40 billion. Then the Abbott (you might have seen him on reddit) government came along and said the plan was actually going to cost double that (complete BS) and that we need to completely change the NBN. They changed it to fibre to the node and are still going to use the ancient rotting copper network for connecting premises to node. The copper network we used to own before the government sold it, then had to buy it back for 11bn dollars. We have been promised so many different things and lied to so much it's impossible to work out what the fuck is even going on. All we do know is that so far only 390,000 premises are connected. Latest I heard NBN users will be limited to 12mbps down. Abbot has said that in the past that everyone will have 25mbps by 2016 (not going to happen) and has said that everyone will have 50 mbps by 2020 and commentators have said this is impossible under the plan. They have squandered countless billions and at the end of the day almost no one has decent internet, and wont for the next decade. If they ever complete the NBN it will be obsolete. Now they are ssaying the NBN wont be able to keep up with demand from netflix users at an affordable price (we just got netflix). Our multi billion dollar super fast network of the future (that never even comes) cant even cope with today's demands for internet use. This is one of the most important issues facing our country but few even understand, not the politicians or the punters. The other thing is 4G mobile networks are probably as fast as what the NBN will be in 2020. We have 80% of the population in 5 cities! Just build wireless FFS. Plus 5G will make the NBN obsolete.   Edit: reference for the 12mbps thing, http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/06/01/the_nbns_speed_limit_making_fttn_play_nice/"

The result of this is that many industries, especially utilities and similar, which are considered essential by most people, end up with a profitability model that is directly at odds with customer satisfaction.   The same arguments could be made for health care, prisons, power companies, and banks.  Some types of services would have to be heavily regulated to bring their offerings in line with what is actually good for consumers."

explainlikeimfive,3e2mfy,Lokiorin,5,Tue Jul 21 14:16:25 2015 UTC,"Sure, but what company can afford to do that?  Internet services aren't cheap by any stretch of the imagination.  We're talking about tens of billions in upfront costs just to lay the infrastructure.  That's kind of the core problem the US has.  Since we're a huge country geographically, it takes a lot of time/money/work to build a country wide network.  The current network was built well before the invention of fiber-optic cables, so it's not capable of that level of speed... yet.  Remember - Google is laying it's Fiber in selected cities... and it's costing them hundreds of millions to do so.  Google hasn't rolled this out country wide because it would break the company in half to try."

As you can see from all the other posts in this thread, people are pretty bent out of shape about this issue.    Yes, internet in cities is better but even rural internet isn't terrible.  It's only bad when compared against the high end from countries that are A) significantly smaller and B) have invested huge amounts of money in recent years to build out their infrastructures.

explainlikeimfive,3e2mfy,lollersauce914,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:30 2015 UTC,"Is that 30 mb/s an ""up to"" or an ""at least""? I pay $45 a month for 15 mb/s business class in Texas (going to my home, not a business), but its a guaranteed speed of at least 15 mb/s. A lot of the complaints against ISPs in the U.S. is that they are sold an ""up to"" speed, so the ISP generally gets much less than advertised.  A lot of people also bitch about the raw numbers instead of reality, imo. Sure, 50mb/s is faster than 1.5, but when 1.5 still streams Netflix without major pausing and most games with under 30ms ping times, it doesn't really matter outside of the ""they have a faster normal speed!"" Argument."

explainlikeimfive,3e38fz,lollersauce914,4,Tue Jul 21 16:52:06 2015 UTC,"Being strict constructionist is not really related to this issue because this is not an issue where the constitution was re-interpreted but was amended per the constitution.

explainlikeimfive,3e38fz,BillTowne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:37 2015 UTC,"A strict constructionist opposes pretty much any amendment to the constitution on the face of things. One of the big reasons they would argue it is bad policy is because the framers put that provision into the constitution for a reason and the constitution is not meant to be a ""living document"" out of which the federal government can carve out powers that are supposed to be reserved for the states, as the 17th amendment does.  The logic and reasoning for the conservative argument against the 17th amendment comes from strict construction philosophically."

They see popular election of senators as a denial of the states' ability to influence the federal government, particularly in the case of 'top-down' policies they don't like (a recent example, but far from the only one, is Obamacare)."
explainlikeimfive,3e38fz,alexander1701,4,Tue Jul 21 17:09:34 2015 UTC,"Not a right wing American, but I am a nerd when it comes to constitutional documents.  When you have more than one 'chamber' in the house of representatives (like 'The House' and 'The Senate'), it's called 'Bicameralism' - two chamberism. It adds a bit of complexity to voting. So why have bicameralism? What does it add?  The idea of bicameralism is to help fix problems inherent from a voting scheme. For example in Britain, the House of Commons was meant to be the voice of the people, with seats distributed according to population centers, and the House of Lords was meant to be the voice of the nobility, with hereditary seats. This way, a bill could only be passed if it was approved by both the rich and the poor alike.  In America, the chambers are meant to help counterbalance the different sized states. Leading up to the revolution, the smaller states were worried that they would always get trampled in congress by bigger states. California has 53 congressmen right now, and Delaware only has 1. That's a big problem for Delaware if anything comes up which negatively affects their state.  The Senate has an equal number of senators from each state, so Delaware and California sit as equals there. In principle to pass a law in the United States, you need to have a majority of the population and a majority of the states agree.  So why are people complaining? Well, time was that the Senators were appointed by the governors. In a way they were still elected officials, because the governor was elected. But they were on the governor's ticket the same way a Vice President is today, so they were connected. Some people argue that Senators aren't doing their jobs right anymore. They focus on national level politics, getting involved in the Republican v Democrat debate rather than attempting to champion an individual state's policies and ideas. The simple truth is that most people don't ask 'did my senator vote X on this issue that affects my state?', but 'Do I prefer republicans or democrats?'   Critics of this system claim that by tying senators to state level government, they can enforce the Senators' constitutional role as the champions of the state. Proponents of elected senators argue that all national discourse is currently at the Republican v Democrat level, and that since all issues are divided this way it doesn't matter that Delaware's senators don't support Delaware-specific issues, that it counterbalances the states just to have 2 extra democrats for the tiny Democrat state.  A third group favor broader electoral reform. They argue that in today's mass-travel high density world, you don't need 53 congressmen in California at all. They would like to see it work much like the German system, where Congress is elected by a non-regional system of 'proportional representation' and the Senate is elected like it is now to represent regional interests. This view is an extreme minority, but I included it to help frame the discussion around the idea that we don't need to be bound by constructionism: we should make our government work however will be best. So don't just ask what the founders wanted, ask what you want. Do you think it would be better if the Senators reported to state governors, or not?"
