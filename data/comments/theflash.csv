As the force-field appeared to fail, Wells rushes into the force-field so fast that no one had time to think and were all frozen, making it look like the Reverse Flash pulled him into the field. In the field, Wells hits himself so fast that no one can see it and makes it look like the hologram of the Reverse Flash is doing it.[2] After the field disappears, Wells runs to his room, puts his suit on and leaves a very lifelike speed-mirage of Wells laying on the floor by bouncing back and from both locations repeatedly, then snatches the device as the Reverse Flash and speeds it to his secret room. He then reappears in the basement, and while still bouncing back and forth to maintain the speed-mirage of Wells, the Reverse Flash kills Eddie's task-force in seconds without any effort and attacks Joe, letting Eddie live. This reminded him of his previous threat to Joe, then The Flash arrived and fought him. However, the Reverse-Flash again proved superior to the Flash, but he was timely saved by Firestorm. The Reverse-Flash vowed their fight wasn't over and ran."

Two things:  First of all, changing a white character to black and changing a black character to white are not the same thing. I know this shocks you as a white man with little to no perspective, not necessarily because you're racist, but likely because you haven't really done much thinking about it. And why would you? Race doesn't really affect you at all.   Here's the diffference. Representation. Most heroes in fiction and especially in DC Comics, are white, hetero dudes. There is nothing wrong with this inherently, but the problem is that we live in a modern world where more and more people are open to the idea of reading comics, which I think we all can agree is a good thing. Well what happens when a young black girl or boy opens up a book and sees no one they can relate to? The difference is that there is a disproportionate ammount of white characters compared to minorities.   Now, would I prefer for them to create new, interesting characters and stories as opposed to replacing pre-existing ones or retroactively changing races? Sure. We can have that conversation without it becoming a battle between the informed and the un-informed. But, it's simply intellectually dishonest and (sorry) ignorant to say that changing races one way is the same as the other. It's just not true.  And secondly, uh, dude...Ezra Miller is white."

theflash,3e2bcn,MonkeyFu,4,Tue Jul 21 13:45:45 2015 UTC,"I agree, though the idea that the Flash can pick and choose events to change should be balanced out with Flashpoint style failure on his part each time (or perhaps Butterfly Effect type failure), where each time he gets one part right, he messes up something else.  Actually, what would be awesome is if we see him going through the whole trial of trying to save someone and learning all about time travel, etc., just to have him fail over and over, retrying and re-investigating until he finds a root cause and learns he can't solve it himself because his knowledge of time travel will lead to him messing up things later.  Instead he can give his previous self an anonymous tip to be at the right place at the right time, but none of the time travelling knowledge he learned.  Just watching that struggle and the failures and the final lesson would be awesome but tricky.How do you convince people that someone with time travel would NEED to prevent themselves from using time travel (beyond a little nudge)?  How do you rectify that with the possibilities Time Travel offers?  Ooooh!  Even better!  We show him following that pattern over and over!  So it turns out the Flash has always been growing old and dying over and over trying to solve the issues he runs into and then nudging his former self to the solution with out teaching him about time travel (because he learns the same ""time travelling leads to bad things lesson).  Anyway, I really feel the idea of a speedster REALLY hasn't been explored well enough.  There are too many possibilities that haven't been written."

The fact that they're re-releasing Geoff Johns' run on Wally at the end of the year in trade form makes me think that pre-Flashpoint Wally will be showing up fairly soon  DC is being so silly with the Flash family. I think it's because they think new readers are too stupid to handle more than on itteration of the Flash.   Jay is around, but only on Earth2, and he hasn't crossed over with Barry at all yet.

This shit happens in comics all the time. Dw, Wally will come back.

theflash,3dlfkf,antemajic11,11,Fri Jul 17 05:42:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, he can think that fast. In some iterations Flash is also able to ""zone out"" and do the basic actions like running/avoiding obstacles on autopilot so that it doesn't feel like he's running for years.  The explanation for how he does these things is the greatest handwave in comics history: The Speed Force. While we're not exactly sure what the Speed Force will be like in the show, we do know it's an extradimensional energy source that grants him a aura that almost entirely removes all the downsides of superspeed (air friction, inertia issues, the fact that he'd be causing nuclear explosions by running so fast) by covering his body in an aura that, for all intents and purposes, is magic. This is why he can grab other people and move them away at superspeed without the G-Forces liquefying their innards.   Sometimes there's little hiccups (Felicity's shirt combusting), but they're rarely hugely consequential. This is also an explanation for how Flash can run super fast and punch someone without them dying immediately -- his aura negates some of the impact unless he's focusing on making the punch work the way he wants it to work (thus the ""Super sonic"" punch).   Presumably, as he grows and gets used to his powers, he'll be able to selectively manipulate this aura more and more. The extents to which is up to the writers."

theflash,3dgjs8,IAMA_Drunk_Armadillo,15,Thu Jul 16 14:41:26 2015 UTC,So a few things I took from that interview  1 Holy shit how high was Ezra Miller!  2 It seems like he is really trying to learn as much about the flash as possible.  He doesn't seem like he is just gonna go in without a clue about the character which gives me hope.  3 He seems like he is very happy about the part which is great a happy upbeat flash is exactly what the dc universe needs.
theflash,3dgjs8,tromedlov7,3,Thu Jul 16 02:50:13 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly a lot more worried about the suit...will it come out of his ring like it's supposed to? Will it be some goofy leather suit or will they just leave it a simple thin fabric that is frictionless he designed or whatever. I'm don't want an origin story though, and I'd like to see a good villian.  As for the actor, cut his hair and let me hear his Barry Allen voice and we'll judge him then. I like his enthusiasm and his want to learn about the character. I know he'll give it his all, and all that's left is the question...were there better picks out there that were left out to get him?"

My perspective on him has changed completely for having watched this stony wallflower geek out so hard"
theflash,3dgjs8,highvoltage988,7,Thu Jul 16 02:32:26 2015 UTC,"This sold me with the passion and excitement he seems to have for the character, and the fact that he's a fan of the show and wants to be an ""alternate universe"" version of Grant Gustin's Flash. I'm excited, I just hope it does as well as the show while remaining unique enough to not just be a retread of what the show's already done so well."

theflash,3d14d4,Brewer_Ent,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:41:24 2015 UTC,So Zoom is different from Professor Zoom?  newbie to comics
theflash,3d14d4,flashfan123,2,Sun Jul 12 17:47:21 2015 UTC,"DC Database can be your best friend.  ""Reverse-Flash is a name used by several speedsters who are enemies to the Flash. The original Reverse-Flash was The Rival, arch-nemesis to Jay Garrick in the Golden Age. Professor Zoom was the first villain to call himself Reverse-Flash, a 25th Century scientist who fought Barry Allen in the Silver Age. Professor Zoom's successor was Zoom, an enemy to Wally West who replicated super-speed by moving through time. Inertia was the evil counterpart to Bart Allen, also calling himself Kid Zoom. The New 52 reboot introduces Daniel West as the new Reverse-Flash, brother to Iris West. Reverse-Flash was created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino, first appearing in Flash #139."""

theflash,3d14d4,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,3,Mon Jul 13 03:47:27 2015 UTC,They said at SDCC (and on Twitter) they were bringing in Zoom and he would be blue.

theflash,3d04ix,oguzhanvarsak,10,Sun Jul 12 10:39:18 2015 UTC,"Jay Garrick was the original Flash from the golden age (he first appeared in 1940). When the silver age started with new versions of the flash (barry allen) and green lantern (hal jordan) etc, they wanted to be able to revisit the old golden age versions of these heros. So in Flash #123 (flash of two worlds) barry allen accidentally vibrated into the earth 2 universe where jay garrick and other golden age heroes existed. After crisis on infinite earths, there was only one earth, with Jay being the World war 2 flash before Barry and Wally.  Zoom (Hunter Zolomon) was the reverse flash for Wally West's flash in Geoff Johns' first run on the flash. He worked for keystone police as a rogue profiler. A bad call his past resulted in his wife leaving him, his knee being shot out, and his father-in-law being shot dead. After an encounter with grodd that left him in a wheelchair, he wanted wally to time travel and reverse all the bad things that happened to him. Wally refused because that could cause more problems, so Zolomon tried to use the cosmic treadmill himself. It exploded and gave him super speed via manipulation of time (so no speedforce). He became the reverse flash so that he could be the villain that would push wally to being a better hero. I would read Blitz and Rogue War to get the full story (well you might as well just read all of geoff johns' first run)  The flash with the blue light may have been zoom, or it may have been the black flash. the black flash is a representation of death that speedsters see before they die. Read the black flash story by Millar/Morrison if you want to know more, it's quite good and Wally outrunning death is pretty damn badass."
theflash,3d04ix,TheStealthBox,2,Sun Jul 12 11:36:42 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for everything!
theflash,3d04ix,TheStealthBox,4,Sun Jul 12 11:47:13 2015 UTC,"No problem. Like I said if you want to know more, just read the comics. I personally recommend #62-225 of Flash vol 2 (Wally West)."
theflash,3d04ix,WhatImMike,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:49:58 2015 UTC,I found some inf about Black Flash and i think i hope the blue light will be him! He is so cool!

theflash,3d04ix,TheStealthBox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:18:50 2015 UTC,The Blue Light could be Cobalt Blue as well.
theflash,3d04ix,still_futile,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:34:14 2015 UTC,Cobalt Blue didn't have super speed though IIRC. He could steal speed for speedsters couldn't he?
theflash,3d04ix,TheStealthBox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:49:14 2015 UTC,Yup. I think I remember him stealing speed from Jay and using it to fight Wally not long after Barry died (before coming back).
theflash,3d04ix,Zombie_Hunter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:59:09 2015 UTC,IIRC he was controlling Jay and other Flashes through the centuries to fight Wally and Barry in the 30th century so he can kill Barry before he fought in COIE.

theflash,3cysyz,barristonsmellme,2,Sun Jul 12 21:57:28 2015 UTC,"I can't think of a single thing from the New 52 Flash that has been used in the show. They even had an easy shot early on in the series(They could've used Mob Rule instead of Multiplex) but didn't. Probably because Geoff Johns gives a lot of the creative and character input for the show and he has nothing to do with the New 52 Flash. As a matter of fact, the only carry over between the two is that they made Wally debut as a black character in the New 52 (when he was previously a ginger) because the Wests in the show were announced as black. Doesn't make a lot of sense but that's how they went about it.  It would be weird for 23-24 year old Barry to be effectively raising a teenager in Wally so I'd agree with that sentiment, but it's almost certain that Wally's showing up at some point in season 2 the same way Roy did in Arrow, probably with very similar changes: aged up to more of a partner role than father/son role."

It'd also be great if he was just a tiny bit ""old fashioned"" racist. And definitely an alcoholic.   I think the most important thing is that he has to keep losing his hat like Indy."
theflash,3cysyz,Splodge_,7,Sun Jul 12 12:08:26 2015 UTC,"No. Garrick is a hero you treat respectfully, like every Flash since has. Jay believes in the basic dignity of people and unless there's an issue I missed, he is more concerned with right or wrong than anything else. Given his relationships with Terrific and Jakeem Thunder, casual racism isn't his thing. And alcoholic? Geddafuggouttaheah.  The character you're describing sounds nothing like Jay Garrick."
theflash,3cysyz,dmull387,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:23:13 2015 UTC,"The Justice League cartoon had an Earth-2-ish episode (not really Earth 2 because they weren't allowed to use the characters). The Jay Garrick character, talking to John Stewart, says something like ""You're a credit to your race"".  Part of the reason they weren't allowed to use the characters was because of stuff like that - it wasn't true to the modern incarnations of the characters - but that kind of racism is believable for Golden Age heroes, if they chose to go that route (which they probably wouldn't in this show)."
theflash,3cysyz,barristonsmellme,2,Sun Jul 12 12:35:42 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite episodes. ""You're a credit to your people,"" he said, and John looked he was gonna be pissed."
theflash,3cysyz,dmull387,0,Sun Jul 12 13:03:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly!   It'd be great to see him start out in the show as an almost has-been and gradually claim back who he is, which could act as a catalyst to spur on Barry in his pursuit of being better and better.   I mean maybe sack off the casual racism part, I was thinking that as more of a throw back to the era he's from in comparison to how it is now.   With that said though you are right, mine is just a fun idea I'd like to see. Whether or not there is another member of the flash family that could take that sort of role I don't know, i'm not super steeped in all the lore, It's more just a casual interest.  Depending on how you interpreted the whole ""that's my cue to leave"" thing from Thawne when the helmet came through (whether you attribute it to the helmet or the whole singularity thing) then we could have already seen how formidable he's meant to be when the big bad villain of the series is like ""yeah no fuck this i'm out."" at the sign of his possible arrival."

I'm a fan of overly powered people going off the rails so it's probablymore just a personal want than a smart direction.

This equation expresses the fact that mass and energy are the same physical entity and can be changed into each other. Barry's team name was E=mc Hammer because MC Hammer's dancing was a form of kinetic energy."

theflash,3brn2x,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Wed Jul 1 16:34:24 2015 UTC,"First off, you have to know that there have been four people that have taken on the mantle as The Flash. They are Jay Garrick (40s-50s), Barry Allen (50s-80s, 2010-now), Wally West (80s-2010), and Bart Allen (06-07).  The two that get the most recognition are Barry Allen and Wally West. Here are some recommendations:   Barry Allen: Most of his stories are from the 50s-80s and I haven't read any of those. Just know that he sacrificed himself during Crisis on Infinite Earths and go from there.   Flash: Rebirth: This is the reintroduction of Barry to the DC Universe. It's a fantastic story and I highly recommend it. It features the Flash Family (Jay Garrick, Wally West, Bart Allen, Jesse Quick, and Max Mercury).  Dastardly Death of the Rogues: This comes right after Rebirth and Blackest Night(Green Lantern story) but it is still a Flash story. Rogues from the future come back to try and arrest Barry. It's a very fun story and I recommend it. Flashpoint: Probably the best Flash story I've ever read IMO. Major time travel consequences. If you watch the show, then you'll understand this story.  New 52 Flash series: After Flashpoint, DC did a reboot on a majority of the characters, and The Flash was one of them. This will retell the origin story of Barry Allen and explore his time as The Flash. It's a great story, and the artwork is phenomenal.   Wally West: Former Kid Flash, turned The Flash. He becomes The Flash right after the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths.   Read this list in order to get a good taste of Wally West. I read a good majority of that list and got a good understanding of the character.  You could read Wally's solo run before you get to Flash: Rebirth if you want. Rebirth is one of the last stories you'll see Wally West as The Flash.  I hope this helps! Have fun reading!"

theflash,3brn2x,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:31:24 2015 UTC,"It's the classic Wally vs. Barry that neither character would ever want. I was just pointing out that listing all-Barry to cover comics written between 1994 and 2011 (with, yes, a link to the /co/ Wally recs) isn't necessarily the way to go, and part of the reason that Flash: a Celebration of 75 Years was so damn frustrating for me as a Wally fan."
theflash,3brn2x,dmull387,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:35:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't even see the issue listing in that collection but based on past collections like that I'm sure it's horrible. There was a ""Greatest Flash Stories Ever Told"" book released around the 50th anniversary of the character that made little sense beyond their inclusion of Flash Comics #1 and Showcase #4."
theflash,3brn2x,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Wed Jul 1 17:39:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, in this case, it was   Jay selection:   First Jay  First Kanigher Flash story written  First Infantino Flash story drawn  First Rival  Barry Part 1:  First Barry  First Wally  First Cosmic Treadmill  First Iris knows Barry is Flash/a Rogues teamup.  Barry Part 2:   Barry and Jay Against Vandal Savage in the time stream  Superman's race against the Flash!  Reverse Flash takes over Barry's life with the Matter re-distributor  Iris dies  Barry dies  Post Crisis:  Flash 0  Flash 1  Wally at his shrink talking about impostor syndrome  Rogue War conclusion  Flash: Fastest Man Alive first issue (NO SENSE)  Flash Rebirth 1  Flashpoint 5  New 52:  Flash 9, first New 52 Grodd  SO yeah, it's a total Barry cheerleading fest. They even gave him two sections worth of stories. I even wondered why a story like ""Planet of Sport"" would be there, and then I was like ""OH because Kanigher wrote it and he created Barry."" The only reason Jay got as much exposure as he did this collection is because of those links, I think. They didn't even include New 52 Jay in a celebration that's supposed to be about all Flashes. They're really pummeling this ""Barry is the only Flash worth a damn"" thing into the ground. Even Wally's story had Barry show up in the middle of it. If this book had a Bechdel test, but about Barry instead, it would have trouble passing.  I also suspect they only included FMA #1 to justify using that Ken Lashley cover."
theflash,3brn2x,dmull387,2,Wed Jul 1 17:45:50 2015 UTC,"That's actually not bad in terms of what was chosen but should have included several more Wally stories. Flash #79, something from Terminal Velocity, Flash #199 are three that jumped to mind as far too critical to leave out."
theflash,3brn2x,TheStealthBox,2,Wed Jul 1 17:49:47 2015 UTC,"That's the frustration.  The Barry picks were absolutely solid, but at the expense of every other character.

theflash,3brn2x,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:35:17 2015 UTC,"At least you made the wise decision of reading Wally's run before reading Flash: Rebirth onwards, smart move. You may want to read Return of Barry Allen (it was before terminal velocity) as well as all of Geoff Johns' run with Wally. You know what, if you have the time and money, just read from Flash vol 2 #62-225 and then you can read from Flash: Rebirth onwards."

theflash,3bgspm,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Thu Jul 2 19:25:07 2015 UTC,"The difference with Flash compared to Batman is the legacy element. Bruce Wayne is Batman in the overwhelming majority of stories. Barry Allen has been The Flash for about 35 years, his nephew Wally West was the Flash for about 21 years and there have been two others with much shorter tenures. The New 52 completey rebooted the entire history of Flash which is likely why you've heard it's a more logical place to start.   So the question becomes are you concerned about being lost or are you the type of person that can pick things up pretty quickly?"
theflash,3bgspm,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Mon Jun 29 02:33:24 2015 UTC,I know a few things about the other flashes..Jay Garrick and Wally West..I'm most interested in Barry Allen though.  So let's say I'll just go with Barry (For now at least)..Would it be better to start pre-flashpoint or post-flashpoint?  And of course I can get lost if I'm not following a certain chronological reading list.

theflash,3bgspm,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:07:31 2015 UTC,"I started reading comics with new 52 flash, because I've always thought he was a cool hero. Those stories have been good so far, but the fact that 75 years of the ""flash family"" and so many speedster stories are completely gone sort of flattened the experience for me. Barry's original run from the 50's into the 80's was just a different time for comics. Incredibly corny.   I decided to start with Wally taking up the mantle (mid 80's) and have moved forward from there. I will say this much, even when Barry is gone, he never really feels absent. Much of what Wally does is in homage to Barry and what he taught Wally. You meet all the speedsters and watch wally learn things that Barry learned... With much better writers.   TL:DR new 52 flash is a lot of fun, but ultimately you're missing out on many years of really unique development of multiple characters and their stories"

I think the 80s (-ish era) is when we really start to see the transition from throwaway entertainment for children, never expected to be any more memorable or meaningful (at first) than, say, Saturday morning Looney tunes, into the really complex stuff we get to enjoy today   Edit: upon reading my comments, I'm definitely letting my personal preferences and biases leak. I'm just a bit tipsy and suddenly decided to feel very strongly about these things"

If you like modern stuff better and say there is a greater consideration to characterization/fully developed stories, I wouldn't have disagreed. But I find it odd when people can be  dismissive of the writers who created these characters, concepts, and themes in favor of the people who wrote stories about them later."

theflash,3b618y,TheHelicopterStudent,3,Sat Jun 27 06:24:38 2015 UTC,He probably used after effects. Estimated time was probably 30 min to an hour and a half depending on whether or not he needed to look anything up. That's for making the video I'm not sure about render time.

I used Adobe After Effects for the effects and edited it in Adobe Premiere. l found some excellent tutorials on lonearcherfilm's youtube channel. https://www.youtube.com/user/lonearcherfilms  It took more than an hour.

theflash,3azbp2,Dredeuced,2,Wed Jun 24 21:47:57 2015 UTC,I really liked that too
theflash,3azbp2,kaixa,4,Wed Jun 24 23:38:06 2015 UTC,"Well, if we're talking about it here, too, I guess I can just crosspost it on over from the weekly discussion thread on the DC reddit:  This might sound weird coming from me but, aside from the art, I didn't have any complaints about this issue.  I'm a bit worried Venditti is adding way too many characters to the story. Papa Allen's crew, Thawne's crew, and he presumably has to work in Wally and the love interests into the story at some point. He couldn't keep seven characters straight in his previous arcs so I'm not hopeful.  It seems like he's just taking everyone who had some kind of personality before and changing them around, like how Girder is completely different. Thankfully, I wasn't too invested in Girder's history and character so I don't mind that much(I imagine this is how only New-52 readers feel whenever they see me whine about Wally, heh). I imagine it'll be the same for most of Zoom's Doom Crew. Zoom himself was a little creepy, which is fine, I suppose. I get the feeling he's gonna kind of ham it up with a more pronounced version of Johns's Barry obsessed Thawne. If it leads to some consistency and less head scratching idiocy then that's an improvement.  Just for giggles: months without Wally West is now up to 7. Thank goodness DC brought back one of their most beloved characters so people would stop complaining about him not showing up anymore, huh?"
theflash,3azbp2,kaixa,3,Wed Jun 24 19:45:18 2015 UTC,"I usually don't mind Booth much, but this time around the art was just... really bad? It gets visibly worse by the page, and that double spread was so lazy it almost looks like a joke. Also, that second page with Prof. Zoom and Flash... I imagine it's meant to show Zoom moving Barry's hand and kicking his left leg, but what's up with him hooking his right leg over Barry's hip? That page has a really, uh, weird vibe to it.  In contrast, Venditti's writing was okay this time around. Hopefully he'll redeem himself with this story arc, especially if Patty and Iris appear as little as possible. And whoo hoo for papa Allen to the rescue!  Real talk, now: who's gonna win the roommate war, Barry or Moon the pet rat?"
theflash,3azbp2,dgehen,2,Wed Jun 24 20:09:23 2015 UTC,"Booth's faces really get to me, everyone looks the same. And yeah that scene was a tad bit weird, looked like Flash had a Zoom backpack"
theflash,3azbp2,TheStealthBox,3,Wed Jun 24 21:07:03 2015 UTC,"I keep wondering whatever Booth's art would look better with a different inker/colorist, possibly someone who doesn't enable his obsession with drawing every single muscle line on the Flash's body. It's like he spent so much time drawing those that he didn't have time to draw non-deformed faces and backgrounds for half of the pages this issue!"

theflash,3azbp2,TheStealthBox,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:06:04 2015 UTC,you do know you can just go to the weekly comic book discussion on r/DCcomics . you'll get a proper conversation about the issue there

theflash,3azbp2,TheStealthBox,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:53:41 2015 UTC,I know but I was just saying in case you wanted to discuss with more people since the discussions over on r/DCcomics tend to be longer (especially if you mention wally vs barry to bhavbhav or dmull)

theflash,3aux8k,techparadox,2,Wed Jun 24 01:04:08 2015 UTC,"Saints Row started off as an over the top alternative to GTA on Xbox 360 (I think around San Andreas time?), with at the time pretty great graphics and some awesome gameplay elements that GTA didn't have. Saints row 2 came to PC as well and went further, after which Saints Row 3 went even more over the top and Saints Row 4 is pretty much Saints Row 3 with a different story and superpowers.  Basically, Saints Row is everything GTA doesn't have. Some parts aren't as well worked out as in GTA but lots are a lot better than GTA too."

theflash,3a6z7y,Abatog,2,Thu Jun 18 09:01:12 2015 UTC,"The way I look at it, there are 6 episodes of Arrow that impact The Flash, but 3 of them are fairly minor and missing them does not effect continuity of The Flash...but the other 3 most certainly do. The second half of ""Flash vs. Arrow"" (Arrow's ""The Brave and the Bold"") is one of those three.  The other two would be the two-part story from Arrow S2 that introduce Barry Allen and which end with the particle accelerator explosion that turns him into a speedster.  I have a hard time believing that Warner is leaving those three key episodes off the set! :(    Arrow: The Scientist Arrow: Three Ghosts Arrow: The Man Under the Hood (minor) Arrow: The Calm (minor) Flash: Pilot Flash: Fastest Man Alive Flash: Things Your Can't Outrun Flash: Going Rogue Flash: Plastique Flash: The Flash is Born Flash: Power Outage Arrow: Draw Back Your Bow (minor) Flash: Flash vs.Arrow Arrow: The Brave and the Bold Flash: The Man In The Yellow Suit Flash: Revenge Of The Rogues Flash: The Sound And The Fury Flash: Crazy For You Flash: The Nuclear Man Flash: Fallout Flash: Out of Time Flash: Rogue Time Flash: Tricksters Flash: All Star Team Up Arrow: Broken Arrow (minor) Flash: Who is Harrison Wells?

theflash,3a6z7y,Abatog,2,Thu Jun 18 10:36:39 2015 UTC,Good point! Hopefully they will add them. Both shows would gain from it.
theflash,3a6z7y,SnakeEyes0,2,Thu Jun 18 10:56:48 2015 UTC,"Both shows would gain from it.   YUP!  Similarly, going in the other direction, there are 2 very MAJOR episodes of The Flash which have an impact on Arrow S3 continuity, and a few minor crossovers as well...  Arrow: The Calm Flash: Pilot (minor) Arrow: Sara Arrow: Corto Maltese Flash: Going Rogue (minor) Arrow: The Magician Arrow: The Secret Origin of Felicity Smoak Arrow: Guilty Arrow: Draw Back Your Bow Flash: Flash vs. Arrow Arrow: The Brave and the Bold Arrow: The Climb Arrow: Left Behind Arrow: Midnight City Arrow: Uprising Arrow: Canaries Arrow: The Return Arrow: Nanda Parbat Arrow: The Offer Arrow: Suicidal Tendencies Flash: All Star Team Up Arrow: Public Enemy Arrow: Broken Arrow Arrow: The Fallen Flash: Who is Harrison Wells? (minor) Arrow: Al Sah-him Arrow: This is Your Sword Flash: Rogue Air (minor) Arrow: My Name Is Oliver Queen    .  EDIT: conclusion - The Flash S1 on DVD/Blu-ray should really have Arrow episodes ""The Scientist/Three Ghosts,"" and ""The Brave and the Bold"" on it as important cross-overs which affect continuity. Maybe also an additional bonus feature with key scenes from ""The Man Under the Hood,"" ""The Calm,"" ""Draw Back Your Bow"" (why did Team Arrow come to Central City anyway?), ""Broken Arrow"" (so we know where Deathbolt came from in ""Rogue Air""), and ""My Name is Oliver Queen"" (so we see the favor Oliver/Arrow called in from Barry at the end of ""Rogue Air""). And...    .    ...The DVD/Blu-ray for Arrow S3 should really have The Flash episodes ""Flash vs. Arrow"" and ""All Star Team Up"" (so we know how Ray Palmer gets crucial tech ideas to advance his A.T.O.M. suit), as these affect continuity. And sure, have that additional bonus feature with key scenes from Flash ""Pilot"" (Olly gives Barry advice), ""Going Rogue"" (Felicity helps; she and Barry talk about their unrequited loves at the end), ""Who is Harrison Wells"" (the Quentin scenes mean nothing to continuity, but Cisco builds the new 'Canary Cry' device!), and ""Rogue Air"" (Olly helps Barry and asks for a favor in return, setting up the Arrow S3 finale)."

theflash,3a0wgh,Saepe,3,Tue Jun 16 11:08:29 2015 UTC,Agree with this. I loved that The Flash made it from 1940-2011 with very little in the way of alterations to continuity. It essentially was one story until the New 52.
theflash,3a0wgh,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,3,Tue Jun 16 12:24:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a big deal.  I've been collecting flash forever (well since '88 or '89 at least) and the stories are always changing.  It's a shame that DC has closed off an avenue of story, but it's not like the first time this sort of thing has happened.  I love Wally.  He was my flash.  As far as I'm concerned Bart Allen was at his very best when he was written by Mark Waid and William Messner Loebs.    But I'm also excited for the move forward.  I really wish that they haven't really screwed the pooch on the new Wally (the racist cliche that he is) but a new and better writer can turn that around and we can see a brand new brilliant relationship bloom between the two.  And how is that not exciting?  We get to see to be on the ground floor of a brand new Flash family being born.  And as long as they get a better creative team than Van Jensen, Vendetti and Booth we can get something amazing.  So it sucks now, but it can get better and one day years and years from now kid's will be angry when they reboot it all over again because the flash family they grew up with (aka this one) will be gone."
theflash,3a0wgh,doesntgetthepicture,2,Tue Jun 16 18:54:59 2015 UTC,So it sucks now   Well that's the whole point. Sure it can and likely will get better but there was no reason to obliterate Flash history. There are ways to provide a jumping on point for for new readers without wiping out the first 75 years of history to anyone that's followed along.  Had they given us something at least resembling what came before I think people would be much more accepting of change.
theflash,3a0wgh,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:38:37 2015 UTC,"They did it when they rebooted with Barry Allen in the sixties instead of Jay Garrick and it worked out then.  There is no reason why it shouldn't work now.  And it's not like the old comics don't exist anymore.  You can still read them.  The history still exists.  And the whole convergence ending means they can still use them in the future if they really want to.  But now they can do their own thing without being beholden to all that history.  It's an opportunity.  One they are squandering a bit at the moment, but that doesn't mean it's doomed.  And to your last point I think people almost always hate change.  I know personally that when I heard about the new 52 I was against it.  I didn't want any of what I considered ""my"" stories changed.  But the more I thought about it, the more I grew excited about all the brand new things they could do, without being tied down to continuity.  They've kinda screwed the pooch a bit but with the right creative talent they could blow it up to something amazing."
theflash,3a0wgh,doesntgetthepicture,3,Tue Jun 16 21:44:31 2015 UTC,"They did it when they rebooted with Barry Allen in the sixties instead of Jay Garrick and it worked out then.

And the whole convergence ending means they can still use them in the future if they really want to.   That situation isn't even comparable. When Barry debuted in 1956, Jay hadn't had his own comic for 7 years and hadn't even appeared in a comic for 5 years. They introduced an entirely new character, but still left the door open for that character to return, which they did to great success 5 years later. What DC did with the New 52 was taking an existing character and clear his entire history and that of every person he had a relationship with. As much as I love classic Jay and Wally, it would be meaningless to see them interact with N52 Barry as he has no idea who they are.    It's an opportunity. One they are squandering a bit at the moment, but that doesn't mean it's doomed.   Again I never said that it was. I specifically said in my post that it can and will likely get better. Until it does though don't expect people not to be upset about the lost elements to the character they loved or for them not to discuss ways that it could have been done better."

I'm ok with Wally being black too, as long as they keep his personality the same. It's just the total destruction of Bart Allen that makes me think we won't be getting a new Flash family for a long time. This new arc looks like it's gonna be better than the last, and GL #41 from Vendetti was pretty good, so I'm crossing my fingers"
theflash,3a0wgh,walterpinkman45,2,Wed Jun 17 07:01:16 2015 UTC,"Just remember that Wally wasn't always The Flash. He used to be Kid Flash and I think that's where the writers are eventually going to take him. I think his silver suit looks amazing, but I understand what you mean about their back stories. They have butchered Bart Allen, Wally West, and Jay Garrick.  Bart could still possibly make a comeback in the future, but it's highly unlikely.   Jay is young and I don't see him joining the Flash Family.  Wally is still powerless, but he has been seen with powers. Give it some time, and I think Wally will grow on us. He is supposed to be back in the next few issues. I have faith!"

While that's true, he didn't deserve to be relegated all the way back to kid sidekick. They really should have done what they did for Nightwing or Arsenal, his contemporaries. New 52 should have started with a slightly de-aged Wally(maybe about 20) who had taken on his own unique identity."
theflash,3a0wgh,walterpinkman45,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:10:11 2015 UTC,"But Wally really didn't take his on own identity until Barry disappeared during CoIE. With Barry being rebooted and rebelling his origin, there wasn't much they could do besides make Wally the kid sidekick."
theflash,3a0wgh,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:14:49 2015 UTC,"But Barry, like all the other heroes of the N52, is 5 years into his career.

theflash,3a0wgh,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Tue Jun 16 14:36:14 2015 UTC,"Daniel West has the worst origin of any Flash villain. The Silver Age Top laughs at Daniel West.

That silver suit in the Futures End tie-in looked awesome though, so hopefully your faith will be rewarded"
theflash,3a0wgh,suss2it,0,Wed Jun 17 06:54:12 2015 UTC,"Welcome to 2011. The Flash family hasn't been around and won't be around for...well, I was gonna say for a long time but it's already been gone for nearly a decade with the brief hiccup of Flash Rebirth before it got reburied."
theflash,3a0wgh,dmull387,-1,Wed Jun 17 00:32:31 2015 UTC,"There already are two Flashes currently, Jay Garrick in Earth-2 and Barry on Earth-1. Anymore than that would be redundant and your Green Lantern comparison doesn't hold up because multiple Green Lanterns is part of the GL mythology and has been for decades and that's simply not true for the Flash. I wouldn't mind more speedsters or whatever but anymore than the two Flashes we have right now is pushing it."
theflash,3a0wgh,suss2it,2,Tue Jun 16 15:01:01 2015 UTC,"Multiple Flashes teaming up has been the norm since the 1960s. Having multiple Flashes is not redundant, and if it bugs you that much, the McGees haven't been around since Flashpoint, so Wally taking Speed Demon as a name isn't out of the question."
theflash,3a0wgh,dmull387,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:15:27 2015 UTC,"Funny you should mention Speed Demon because he's already a speedster over at Marvel and they got Jason Spisak (the guy who voiced Wally in Young Justice) to voice him in Avengers Assemble. But yeah in a perfect world it'd be like how it was in Young Justice, Jay Garrick is the first and semi-retired Flash, Barry is the second and active one, Wally West is an aging semi-retired Kid Flash who's the mentor for Bart Allen aka Impulse."
theflash,3a0wgh,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,3,Tue Jun 16 17:26:04 2015 UTC,"Also, perfect world, Irey would be Kid Flash, Wally and Jay would be retired, Bart would be Flash, so we could once again have a Bartholomew Allen under the cowl."
theflash,3a0wgh,dmull387,2,Tue Jun 16 19:04:01 2015 UTC,"In my perfect world Bart would have stayed Flash(until 20-25 years went by and Irey took over) and DC would have restarted All-Flash Quarterly which would tell new Flash stories with Jay, Barry and Wally in an anthology format. Everybody wins."

theflash,3a0wgh,dmull387,2,Tue Jun 16 19:00:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was a Squadron Supreme episode, and thank god Speed Demon changed his name to that instead of sticking with the Whizzer. Marvel for some reason decided to bring back the Whizzer in the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon, but as a separate, old golden age hero. Actually reminded me of Jay Garrick.  Also, Speed Demon was recently a main character in the Superior Foes of Spider-Man by Nick Spencer and Steve Lieber, which is underrated and straight up awesome. If you're a fan of the Rogues it gives off a similar vibe by showcasing the world of loser supervillains who keep trying to pull off elaborate schemes."
theflash,3a0wgh,suss2it,2,Tue Jun 16 19:58:24 2015 UTC,"You lost me at ""Rogues"" followed with ""loser supervillains."" :P I actually prefer Busiek's Thunderbolts or Secret Six to Superior Foes, as of right now at least.  Whizzer was a Golden Age hero as well, which is where Roy Thomas got the name for the Squadron Sinister/Supreme version."
theflash,3a0wgh,dmull387,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:26:39 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, that explains USM's usage. And I love the Rogues but I never really saw them as winners."
theflash,3a0wgh,Dredeuced,2,Tue Jun 16 20:35:21 2015 UTC,"The Johns run, while not particular great in its Wally characterization, really changed that around. They haven't been considered lightweights in the DCU proper for years. They're, at this point, considered some of the most dangerous in and out of universe because they a. don't play by other supervillains' rules, and b. they can make a man who runs faster than the speed of light sweat on a regular basis."
theflash,3a0wgh,suss2it,2,Tue Jun 16 20:42:49 2015 UTC,The Rogues win more than most villains. Probably because they're also the most likely villains to team up with the heroes/against other villains.

I don't think any of the mistakes this creative team has made for Wally are irreparable, although I am pessimistic that they realize they've made mistakes."
theflash,39y339,Yaseen121,2,Tue Jun 16 14:21:02 2015 UTC,They're irreparable. It's broken and there's really no fixing all the problems. They're just ignorable and retconnable.  They won't realize their mistakes because they don't believe there's any mistakes. They legitimately believe Wally is a good character. They have no intention or interest in him resembling the old Wally because A: DC doesn't care about that and B: Jensen and Venditti have never read a Wally West story in their life so how could they possibly write him even slightly in character? That's why I'm just praying that this is their last arc so someone who actually has even the slightest understanding of the characters they're writing can get involved.
theflash,39y339,TheStealthBox,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:03:16 2015 UTC,I don't think you people understand how bad Vendetti and Jensen write characters. Their 'Wally West' (its really just a random character with fan favourite's name slapped on) is very unlike-able and share's no traits with the real Wally.
theflash,39xp8i,Scolor,25,Mon Jun 15 17:25:46 2015 UTC,"In 1984 Flash comics Barry Allen was on trial for killing the Reverse Flash.  Barry killed the reverse flash in order to save Fiona Webb, the woman to whom Barry was engaged.  See years earlier the reverse flash killed Iris and Barry couldn't let history repeat itself.  The trial went on for a very long time and Flash comics were winding down to the finale issue as they were tying off all the loose ends on the pre-crisis continuity.  Barry was finally found innocent, but his life had been ruined due to the trial.  Fiona had a nervous breakdown, and due to convoluted circumstances Barry Allen was presumed dead or missing by the general public (basically anyone who didn't know his secret identity), and he got plastic surgery at Gorilla city to look like someone new, so he had no life to go back to.    What Barry didn't know is that his first love Iris West (later his wife Iris Allen) was actually from the future.  She was sent back into the past as a baby for reasons I don't remember and was adopted by the West family.  When the reverse flash killed her, her biological parents from the future used their advanced technology to pull her soul from her body and transport it through time into a new body in the future.   To give Barry a happy ending in his finale issue he learns that Iris is alive in the future and he travels through time (as he is wont to do) to live with the woman he loves, even though now they both look like two completely different people.  They had a blissful month together in the 30th century before Barry was pulled back through time to the crisis on infinite earths and is captured by the Anti-monitor.  Barry's unique speed/vibrational abilities makes him a very unique threat to the Anit-monitor's plans (to destroy the multiverse).  Barry sacrifices his life to save the multiverse, escaping from the Anit-monitor and destroying his universe breaking machine.  Back in the 30th century unbeknownst to Barry before he was sucked back to the crisis, Iris became preggers.  She had two kids, Don and Dawn Allen.  Dawn Allen Married someone with the last name Ognats and they had a daughter Jenni (who became the speedster XS in the Legion of Super Heroes)  Don married Melonie Thawn, an ancestor of Eobard Thawne (aka the reverse flash).  They had Bart Allen.  But unlike his cousin Jenny who was able to age fine with her powers, Bart's super speed was aging him too fast.  At six months he looked one, at one he looked three, at three he looked 13.  Due to this he was kidnapped by people in the Earthgov (I think) to study his powers and his aging, and Bart was raised in a virtual reality environment that moved as fast as he did so his brain would develop as fast as his body.  Eventually Iris found her grandson, rescued him from his captors, and brought him back in time to Wally West, who was able to save Bart.  Wally suffered from a similar malady when he first got his powers and knew that Bart needed to just break through a ""wall"" in speed and his body would equalize and age normally.  They succeeded and both Bart and Iris stayed back in the 20th century.  But this is only the Pre-flashpoint Bart Allen.  The post Flashpoint Bart Allen has nothing to do with Barry Allen at all.  Currently he's really a humanoid Alien named Barr Tor (or is a human from a different planet due to colonization, I'm really not sure as I don't read Teen Titans), and has no connection to the speed force (at least according to Flash comics, I have no idea how he got his powers).  He was sent back in time as part of a witness protection bit from the future and took on the assumed identity of Bart Allen.  The last name just being a coincidence and is of no familial relation to Barry at all.  I think he went back to the future, cleared up whatever issue he had there and for reasons, again unknown to me, came back to the 21st century to hang with the Titans.  The End....  or is it?"

Hold onto your ass, because I have a rant prepared ahead of time for just this situation.  Frankly, I'm kind of sick of people blaming Iris for acting like any normal person would when all of the most important men in her life are acting super shady towards her.  Her father continuously insists on treating her like a child who can't do anything for herself. Even before the threats from RF, he insists that Barry keep the Flash a secret from her to protect her. Then he dances around any Flash stuff, hoping she's going to fall away from it.  Then Barry. He's lying to her, under Joe's orders, about his involvement with the Flash. But then he visits her as the Flash? And on top of that, he then beats on her boyfriend  (under Rainbow Raider's influence, but it's not all RR) and nearly causes a rift in that relationship. Not to mention how she is doing her work on the Flash for him. She explicitly says so, because she knows how important it is to Barry to have something to believe in. How does he repay her? By shutting her down and yelling at her. Then he suddenly dumps his childhood crush and all the baggage that comes with that on her the minute she's about to move in with the only man who treats Iris like an adult on this show, Eddie.  And poor Eddie. And poor Iris. Ever since everyone else started acting weird with her, Eddie has been in her corner. He's been nothing but a loving, gracious, mature and loyal boyfriend to her. He lost his temper on Barry once, even though he had more than enough reason to before that, and was the first to apologize and hug it out when Caitlin covered Barry's ass on lightning psychosis.  Now, when her mentor is gone, her father and foster brother have been acting weird as all hell, and she needs his support more than ever... he's withdrawn. He's sullen.  And he's keeping secrets from her. He finally tells her the truth, that he's working with the Flash, and she forgives him, because he ""came clean"" with her, as far as she knows. Then he goes and does all that stuff in the season finale.  But no, Iris is the bitch, for finally having enough. Maybe the ultimatum towards Eddie was a bit much, but she's nearly been killed at least twice since the show started. She's allowed to show an extreme of emotion, especially when everyone, from Joe, to Barry, to Mason (since she bought the lie that he ran off to South America) to now Eddie is hiding stuff from her.   When she finally found out about Barry as the Flash, she found out that almost everyone around her had to be lying to her for close to a year now. And what does Barry do? He throws ""well, you're lying to me about being in love with me."" What the ever-lovin' hell, Barry?

theflash,39mvau,wiccabilly,6,Fri Jun 12 23:22:51 2015 UTC,"I get fairly annoyed with the excess of Iris hate, because it almost never comes with a critical eye towards Barry, Joe, or Eddie's actions that her own reactions tend to be based off of. Part of it is that the writers admittedly do not know what to do with her many times, but a big part of it is that when there are elements of a show that are unpleasant, it is all too easy to blame it on the women characters."
theflash,39mvau,erenjaegerbomb93,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:29:02 2015 UTC,I get fairly annoyed with the excess of Iris hate   What Iris hate? All I've really seen are lamentations that the writers weren't doing anything with the character. At least now she's got something relatable going on. I was happy to not like what she was doing just because I finally CARED what she was doing.
theflash,39mvau,dmull387,2,Sat Jun 13 04:57:04 2015 UTC,My only problem with her was the ultimatum she gave him. I'm going into the police academy and every cop I've talked to says there are situations they wish they could forget but they keep having nightmares about. Ad they don't want to talk about because A) they're trying to forget and B) they don't want to have other people thinking about it and burdening them. I agree that she should have been upset that everyone was lying to her but when Eddie used the excuse about the darkness she should have left it at that the same way she had been growing up with a father in the force.
theflash,39mvau,erenjaegerbomb93,2,Sat Jun 13 10:44:41 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. That's her only truly bad character moment. Everything else, I think, is blown out of proportion by guys who seem to think her being interested in an attractive dude with a stable job and a pretty awesome personality instead of the guy who she grew up with like a brother is a crime punishable by death."
theflash,39mvau,wiccabilly,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:57:05 2015 UTC,Yeah I just hope the writers develop her more. I really like Iris and like you said that's her flaw but every character has to have flaws.

Didn't like Supergirl trailer because the costume is super dark when the character really belongs in bright colors?

I think they've made strides over the course of the season and I can totally see them giving her a very tragic but moving tilt toward Killer Frost. I'm feeling very positive and excited about the Cailtyn character. Like she's kind of Willow and Tara combined into one.

That bit in the Grodd episode where Barry uses the thought of Iris to motivate him and help him push Grodd in front of the train was badass, and really classic Flash, but she was written really badly in the last half of the season. Just constantly bitching. I can understand her being upset when being lied to, but when she says she doesn't care if Eddie is having difficulties talking, and she said that she should know? That just came off as her being a crazy bitch. Hopefully they write her a bit better in season 2, because Iris is a great character in the books"

theflash,39mvau,ZachsMind,2,Sat Jun 13 03:24:40 2015 UTC,"Karen Page (in Daredevil) has this weird sense of morality that she hasn't thought through very well which is why it constantly gets her into trouble and indirectly got Ken Urich killed . Naive doesn't exactly fit her bill tho. She hasn't the right to be naive if the writers are hinting at her past to coincide with the comics. Admittedly though, the writers are intentionally keeping her as a blank slate a little bit, cuz they didn't want to make some decisions about her yet. We're supposed to be surprised in a future season when it's revealed what her secret past is. This season the story wasn't really about that so they kept us, and i guess the actress Deborah Ann Woll, in the dark about a lot of stuff. I'm hoping that changes next season. Considering what she had to work with, I thought Woll did a good job.   Iris West (The Flash) is headstrong and arrogant, for sure. Always has been. However, I think this TV incarnation has a right to be upset. Even her boyfriend Eddie knew about Barry before she did, and everyone was trying to ""protect"" her from the truth even tho throughout the season Barry's secret got her in trouble directly on more than one occasion. Knowledge is power and she knows this. It's why she's a journalist. She wants to know what's going on. I have no problems with this incarnation of Iris. In fact it's one of the things about this variant on the Flash mythology that I'm actually digging. I'm saddened that TV City can't seem to figure out how to bring the Barry Allen of my childhood to life (Silver Age Barry before the Crisis On Infinite Earths) but Iris in the comics was sometimes more a damsel in distress than anything. That's changed in recent decades and I think for the better. This version of Iris works for me. Especially compared to past incarnations. Plus I adore Candace Patton. She has done in my mind for Iris West what Samuel L Jackson did for Nick Fury. Maybe she don't look the part from the classic source material, but Patton is, for my money, the best person for the role.   Caitlin Snow is trickier. Whereas both Marvel's Karen Page and DC's Iris West have decades of back story under their belt for the writers to use abuse or ignor at their leisure. The Caitlin Frost character first appeared I think around 2013..? Give or take? Though there is some source material in the comics, she's mostly whatever the writers want her to be. I mean very few diehard fans of comics are gonna freak out over whether or not they get Caitlin Snow right from the comics. In this incarnation for the tv series it's clear the writers intentionally kept her a blank slate, with intentions on changing her character in future seasons when the wibbly wobbly timey wimey comes a callin. What we've seen in the first season is going to be very different from the Caitlin Snow of the future. I can't be more specific about that without going into speculative spoilery territory for season two.   Just rest assured if you don't like any of these three ladies this first go around, hold on to your butts. Season two for both Daredevil and The Flash will show sides to these characters we didn't know about before, offering layers of depth that the writers couldn't offer in the freshman year."

The only person on the show that Stephen truly had great romantic chemistry with was Katie, and the showrunner/writers put any possibility of Oliver/Laurel in a rocket and shot it into the sun.  With The Flash having a far superior acting cast, I am a bit more hopeful that they will pick up another good actress and that it might add to the quality of the show.

theflash,3991t1,Lucarai,17,Wed Jun 10 03:28:02 2015 UTC,"The Speed Force, or at least in the New 52 Universe, is yet to be explained in great detail, pre- New 52 however, there is quite a bit of information. The Speed Force is what separates the many Flashes (so to speak) from other excessively fast characters of the DC universe. For instance, Aquaman can swim at 10,000 feet per second (just under Mach 9), yet he isn't considered a member of the Flash family, whereas characters such as Jay Garrick (who couldn't even reach Mach 1 until he met Barry) are. The difference is the Speed Force. As for what the Speed Force actually is, that's a bit more difficult. Access to the Speed Force can be passed genetically, (Ex: Barry Allen to grandson Bart Allen) but the Speed Force can also be made into a physical substance, which has been gifted from a Savothian alien to Jay Garrick. Another component of the Speed Force is that of a spiritual world. It is what all speedsters become when they die (can be seen at the end of the popular Flash VS Braniac/Luthor scene from Justice League Unlimited episode ""Divided We Fall"" ) and there are even other spiritual beings that reside within that realm, with which Bart Allen could interact. The origin of the Speed Force was Barry Allen's accident, and he is what powers it. Even speedsters within other universes or those who existed before Barry can access the Speed Force because his accident created a kind of dimensional boom that permeated every DC reality. This is explained in The Flash # 123, ""The Flash of Two Worlds "", in which Barry accidentally transports himself to Jay Garrick's universe. Let me know if I missed anything big, or if you need clarification on anything. Glad I could help!"

theflash,3991t1,themaxtermind,4,Wed Jun 10 13:43:12 2015 UTC,"So I've recently read about the flash and all his villains and stuff. I have read Flash: Blitz where Wally West encountered Hunter Zolomon.  So basically my question is, Zoom's powers make him control time relative to himself, that means in his world he is moving normally however the world outside of him is moving super slowly, that was how he matched Wally's speed. The thing is, they circled the globe dozen of times in the fight. How does Hunter Zolomon even have the stamina to run normally for that distance? Since he is basically just a normal human in a super slow world."
theflash,3991t1,ultimaspark,7,Wed Jun 10 11:08:29 2015 UTC,"Good one! There was a similar question on r/AskScienceFiction a while ago, but I don't remember seeing a good answer, so I'll do my best to explain it in a plausible way that makes sense. In the treadmill explosion that gave Hunter Zolomon his powers, his place in time was thrown off. This is a really weird concept. To illustrate, imagine you have a point that represents Zolomon. Now place that point moving on a line that represents the natural timeline. On this line, you have more points that represent the events that comprise reality. Now imagine there's a small break in the line, which represents the cosmic treadmill accident. When the point that represents Zolomon reaches that break in the line, the point has the potential to become disconnected from the line altogether. So everything that would  have affected Zolomon in this original timeline no longer could. More or less, the other events on the timeline no longer apply to him, including things such as getting hungry, needing to sleep, and losing energy. He has as much stamina as he does because he exists only in the physical state that he did when he derailed from the timeline. Therefore he has a constant energy, and because of that, infinite stamina. Does that help?"
theflash,3991t1,LinkBoyJT,3,Wed Jun 10 13:39:34 2015 UTC,But if he was controlling time relative to himself doesn't that mean that he is moving normally in a super slow world? If that is the case wouldn't he have gotten bored running from Wally even if he had the stamina. Wally ran the round the globe in a few seconds but to Zoom in his world he obviously ran many times slower thus he spent perhaps hours or days running around the globe.

For instance, the question has been asked multiple times ""what if Eddie just had a vasectomy, or never had kids and then Eobard is never born"". If we base it off this logic, then yes, Eobard would come back, as it seems that only things done in his presence affect his future. Although no one will ever actually know. In terms of my personal favorite Flash, I'm a Barry guy. Although I did love Wally  as Kid-Flash in Young Justice. Give it a watch if you haven't already, it's a very good show.

Why do his fast punches not seem to hurt enemies that much? (IE when he kept running around Oliver and punching is back and sides)"
theflash,3991t1,JayOvaEasy,6,Wed Jun 10 04:57:18 2015 UTC,"If we say that the average American male's fist weighs about 567 grams,  or 1.3ish pounds (according to NASA's studies of the human body), and we put Barry running at just above the speed of sound, so roughly 765mph, that punch would have 33,157 Joules of kinetic energy. To put that in perspective, a point blank shot from an M107 .50 Caliber Sniper Rifle is about 16,000 Joules of kinetic energy.  Double that, and you have a singular punch from the Flash. That's just if Barry is holding his fist straight out in front of him too. It would be much more powerful if you actually factored in the speed his arm is going relative to his body during the punch, but unfortunately we don't have that information.  I would assume that they have him accelerating from 5.3 miles away purely for dramatic effect, as we've seen him go from standing still to seemingly a few hundred miles per hour instantly without thinking twice. Same with the fast punches and Oliver, it wouldn't make for a very good story if one punch and The Arrow was down for the count. Although body armor could also play a small  part in Oliver's case."

theflash,3991t1,JayOvaEasy,2,Sat Jun 13 04:26:01 2015 UTC,Since Eddy killed him self that would mean eobard/reaverse flash is never born thus not being there to kill Barry's mom. So shouldn't she be alive?
theflash,3991t1,TheStealthBox,5,Wed Jun 10 18:24:35 2015 UTC,"This is just a twisted up grandfather paradox. If Eddie never has children, then Eobard never existed, but if he never existed and never came back from the future, what reason does Eddie have for killing himself? They basically just made the entire season paradoxical. It's possible that Barry's mother is alive in an alternate timeline, but more than likely we won't see any more of her, because without her death there would be no Flash, and therefore no show."
theflash,3991t1,JayOvaEasy,2,Wed Jun 10 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"It might not be paradoxical.  Every time anyone does something that can alter the timeline, it creates a new timeline which becomes the timeline.   So, all of those things are/were true, but within their own timeline.   Each change resets it to where the new state is now what is true.  My head hurts."

theflash,394n66,thenottoserious,10,Tue Jun 9 05:54:08 2015 UTC,"Barry's biggest flaw is that he sets himself up for failure. Check out Flash: Rebirth, he's back from the dead and there's literally a five parties for him to attend in a day but he ditches all of them because he feels something terrible will happen. Ironically if he'd gone to the JSA party or the a Teen Titans party he'd have had the support to handle the whole Negative Speed Force thing.  In the New 52 he does the same thing with the others who get Speed Force related posts. Had he kept an eye on them, worked with them to form even a minor local team, Reverse Flash wouldn't have been able to pick them off.  Barry gets in his own way and thinks he should do everything himself. This isn't like Hal who believes he can do everything himself, but Barry thinks it's his responsibility and his alone when the support of others can save him so much trouble."

theflash,394n66,allenflame,7,Fri Jun 12 02:49:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's his hesitation to do what needs to be done.   When you see a villain who you know as dangerous, skip the conversation.

But now after the season is over and westallen is canon for sure, I start to think that maybe Barry's jealousy and obessession might turn into something more productive and positive for his character and heroic duties. Because for Barry's character, his parents are the greatest aspect of his life that is affecting him everyday and is helping him to grew, while his romantic life would be important for his character development too if he does earn iris's love, I think that will give him more drive to be a better man as well as give him some comfort for the misfortune of his parents. If iris become Barry's girlfriend/wife then barry would have something important to fight for and protect besides just clearing his father's name. I just hope they improve iris's character in season 2 and make the relationship more stable so we can actually enjoy the canon pairing. Which in turn would make both characters more mature and enjoyable."

Also, he tends to feel VERY responsible if he can't save someone, as he thinks he should be fast enough to save everyone."

theflash,394n66,W00KIIE,3,Tue Jun 9 17:31:46 2015 UTC,I would definitely say this about the show
theflash,394n66,dmull387,2,Tue Jun 9 16:01:32 2015 UTC,"I think barry and iris pretty much shares the same flaws of emotional immaturely and jealousy. For barry jealousy is from beginning toward the end, for iris is was when barry was with Linda. And emotional immaturity is more serious in iris, the way she is oblivious to Barry's feelings and intentionally disrespecting eddie (for example meeting a guy in a costume secretly), and worst of all bitching at eddie for keeping secrets and ruins ray's fancy dinner. She is not necessarily a bad person, but she is not well developed and had been too lucky so far, the only person who actually lectured her about her flaws was Linda, but then Linda left the show. Barry lectured her too about not honest, but it's about ""you love me too, you love me but you pretend you don't""( this when eddie was still held hostage by a speed psycho). But I think now eddie is dead, iris might grew more mature, tragedies does promote growth sometimes.   And for barry, jealousy and obesseion toward iris are definitely flaws, but they can turn into strength if things workout. Personally I would had respected barry more if he learned to move on and let go (like many people in realife does), but that obviously is not happening, so the next best thing is for him to get the girl so he doesn't have to be jealous anymore. The only reason that I hated the westallen relationship is because eddie is a great dude and iris is happy with him, so it's pretty shitty for barry to want to sabotage it (there was one time when barry was in costume and enthusiastically asked ""you guys broke up""). I think in some ways, barry wants to accept eddie and iris's relationship too, but he only feel that way because he want iris to be happy,not because he take eddie and the relationship itself into consideration. Which make him seem very selfish when treating eddie, for example when eddie was kidnapped, he was still shown to be jealous when iris displayed her love and concern for Eddie, even iris once said she was surprised to see barry taking Eddie's point of view."

Thats why, for example, in the tsunami episode he actually sees himself before he travels back, and then sees himself after he travels back.

The proof we have that Eobard is from a different timeline is simply the historical facts given to us by Gideon, an AI programmed by Future Barry.

theflash,38wtq4,Justice_Prince,6,Mon Jun 8 15:55:55 2015 UTC,I think your right.  My theory is that if Eddie had killed himself at any other time it would have done nothing to Eobard.  The space time continuum was much more sensitive at the moment though because of the recent rupture so it instead caused what happened on the show.

The same goes here. you'll see the backstory of the Rogues and such later on"

theflash,38qm1y,Toesmasher,3,Sat Jun 6 01:36:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what part is confusing.   The narration in these kinds of stories generally start with the protagonists before they even get their powers. It's also established that the Flash has encountered a few rogues such as Cold and The Trickster before. While you don't really miss out on any information it might simply not start where you expect it to start, hence the confusion."

Yeah, but it's only confusing if you're 12, or have never picked up a book before. Beginning a story in the middle of the action, and filling everything in as you go along isn't at all unusual."

Not that OP hasn't read a book, but that this just isn't how most people approach comic books. I'd wager most people with no previous experience have the same expectations out of the first issue out of a comic book series as from a movie or TV series. While there are exceptions, both of these media formats generally start before the protagonist becomes a superhero."

He's reduced or eliminated any of the excess piping and lines Jim Lee added (very little chinstrap too) and the belt is much closer to Barry's traditional style rather than the more angular look that I associate with Wally.   I will say in fairness to Francis Manupal, another artist I love, he was likely forced to keep closer to Jim Lee's designs due to the New 52 just starting."

Also a new arc with Thawne will be starting this month in issue #41, and you can get a free preview of it online right now  Hunter Zolomon/Zoom: Blitz, Rogue War (also features Eobard)  There's also a new 52 Reverse Flash who is seperate from the others versions. For that I'd pick up the first four volumes of new 52. Reverse Flash doesn't appear much until volume 4, but it's a large over-arching story that's well-worth the read. These are the three Reverse Flashes most commonly referred to, however there is also Inertia (villain to Bart Allen) and the Rival (villain to Jay Garrick)"

theflash,38anni,Dredeuced,3,Wed Jun 3 00:14:47 2015 UTC,"They weren't allowed to use Thawne, Wally, or anyone in Wally's family besides Iris -- thus why they named her brother Daniel, why their parents are vastly different, and, you know, why they never mentioned Rudolph in their whole flashback/time travel schtick even though that's a pretty glaring omission in retrospect."
theflash,38anni,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Wed Jun 3 00:32:30 2015 UTC,"That's so ridiculous, why would they hamstring the creative team so badly?"
theflash,38anni,Dredeuced,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:37:14 2015 UTC,"Paranoia about the chances for the New 52 to fail. They wanted new stuff for new fans and not old stuff old fans would like. It's why Barry isn't with Iris and why Superman isn't with Lois, etc etc, editorial had a vision for things and they accepted no deviations aside from a few star writers who got to do what ever they wanted ala Morrison, Snyder, Azzarello (and even in Azz's case they just ignored his comic in the rest of the continuity)."
theflash,38anni,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:48:14 2015 UTC,Not that I expect you to disagree but it's such a shortsighted approach. What they actually do with that approach is turn off old fans while presenting new fans with a character that means nothing more or less to them than the original character.
theflash,38anni,Dredeuced,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:57:34 2015 UTC,"On the issue of the relationships it's more a matter of they don't want to start at the end point -- everyone knows Superman will end up with Lois and Barry will end up with Iris, they just wanted to differentiate from the previous ""convoluted"" continuity. If you let everything remain similar then that kind of opens the doors for creators to reintroduce old stuff they didn't want introduced.  There's some passing logic to the process but, as seen by them bringing back literally everyone from pre-crisis, there was not actual substance behind it. They could've brought back every character at their origin point and no one would've been any more confused than they were with the New 52's differences."
theflash,38anni,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:53:18 2015 UTC,Do you know if the new 52 series (all of them) are doing well? Do you think we will see more and more ??
theflash,38anni,Dredeuced,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:15:09 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine them stopping it. Flash has rarely gone long without a comic with the exception of the early-mid 50s when most superhero comics were canceled. Especially with the show being so popular they will keep an ongoing for him. As far as the New 52 as a whole, they've probably come too far for to go back to the whole continuity now. Even though sales have returned to pre-52 levels, I doubt they will risk alienating any new readers they've gotten.   On a note related to your original post, Thawne is coming back this month."
theflash,384kfn,Hippieslayer555,15,Mon Jun 1 20:26:17 2015 UTC,"I honestly love all of the Reverse Flashes.    Thawne is the single most insane villain in the DC universe, Joker included.  His obsession led him to change the course of time.  He is a living Retcon.  Hunter Zolomon is one of the best examples of the ""well-intentioned extremist"" trope.  At the heart of everything he and Wally want the same thing, but their moral compasses are completely opposite.  Daniel West isn't as well-loved as any of his predecessors, but his motivation and origin story are pretty well-made.  I even like his costume.    Future Flash, Inertia/Kid Zoom and the Rival aren't on your list, any reasons why?"
theflash,384kfn,HPSpacecraft,8,Mon Jun 1 22:20:47 2015 UTC,"Future Flash, Inertia/Kid Zoom and the Rival aren't on your list, any reasons why?

theflash,384kfn,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,8,Mon Jun 1 22:22:32 2015 UTC,"Thaddeus Thawne is an evil clone of Bart Allen who wears a reverse colored costume in both incarnations.  Edward Clariss wears a dark variation on Jay Garrick's costume.  They're both on the ""Reverse-Flash"" wikipedia page so someone considers them Reverse Flashes."
theflash,384kfn,HPSpacecraft,3,Tue Jun 2 02:43:25 2015 UTC,I just believe that Reverse Flash should be a title meant only for the characters who have actually been called that. The Rival and Inertia despite being evil speedsters have never actually been called that name; wikipedia is meaningless.
theflash,384kfn,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,4,Tue Jun 2 02:46:09 2015 UTC,"The Rival and Inertia aren't just evil speedsters though, they're dark reflections of their opponents."
theflash,384kfn,HPSpacecraft,2,Tue Jun 2 03:10:22 2015 UTC,"I just think the name ""Reverse Flash"" should stick with the characters it's been actually been used for. Characters like The Rival and Inertia have their own unique identities."
theflash,384kfn,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,3,Tue Jun 2 03:13:50 2015 UTC,Agree to disagree then.  Seems weird for certain characters to have a title when others who qualify for it just as much don't.
theflash,384kfn,HPSpacecraft,2,Tue Jun 2 03:18:10 2015 UTC,"It's just how it was written.   I could potentially see Inertia with that title, and had Bart's turn as The Flash not been so short, he probably would have fully taken on that role. However The Rival definitely shouldn't be given that title in my opinion, he's an extremely minor character in Flash history. He has only been featured in a Flash comic once, in Jay's last story before his book was canceled due to low sales."
theflash,384kfn,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,5,Tue Jun 2 03:27:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I never really considered future Flash as a reverse Flash to be honest, but now that I look at it, he does share many of the same quality as a reverse Flash.  As for Kid Zoom and The Rival, I have honestly no clue about those 2, never read anything that involved them though I will edit to add them in."

theflash,384kfn,HPSpacecraft,2,Mon Jun 1 23:20:12 2015 UTC,"My logic is any body who's been the ""Reverse"" E.G Eobard Thane has been the Reverse of Barry Allen, The Rival is the reverse of Jay Garrick and Hunter Zolomon is the reverse of Wally West.   If anybody wishes to include there other people who they view as the Reverse as their favourite that's no problem whatsoever, ultimately this thread is just to have a fun discussion."

You'd have to start thinking about every little thing and wonder if it was Thane.  That time I tripped over, was it really me or Thane?  That time my car broke down, Could it have been Thane?

theflash,384kfn,Dredeuced,4,Tue Jun 2 09:53:50 2015 UTC,Prof.Zoom is my favorite..He's so many things including a Retcon. But the twist of all for me is that he's truly broken..It's the chicken and the egg? From being a fanboy to walking flash historian; all that he had spent his life's love and passion on is what drives him and breaks him changing his life's goal and purpose. He shares a trait given to the truly insane villains in comics to me That's the obsession they have with their protagonists. His desire to destroy what allows him to be is brilliant. It's no different than Joker wanting to break Bruce
theflash,384kfn,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Mon Jun 1 23:04:30 2015 UTC,"All True. I remember in Rebirth Barry had a monologue about how Him and Bruce would always stay late after Justice League meetings comparing notes on criminals and trying to one up each other, and it always came down to Reverse Flash VS the Joker."
theflash,384kfn,Dredeuced,3,Mon Jun 1 23:08:55 2015 UTC,Eobard Thawne
theflash,384kfn,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Mon Jun 1 22:02:25 2015 UTC,Why? If you don't me asking.
theflash,384kfn,Dredeuced,4,Mon Jun 1 22:07:59 2015 UTC,I find him the most interesting. His obsession with Barry Allen and the drive he has to make Barry's life a living hell interests me.
theflash,384kfn,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:14:02 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. His drive and obsession are truly impressive, in a terrifying kinda way."
theflash,384kfn,Dredeuced,4,Mon Jun 1 22:22:06 2015 UTC,"Eobard is my favorite. He's been my favorite villian for as long as I can remember, I was always struck by how, even in his early appearances, his goals were always so personal conpared to a lot of other villans. His desire to have Iris, which eventually led to him killing her was pretty dark for the 60s/70s books. Considering he was the first and only RF for so long probably skews my view.   Hunter was an interesting character and I was happy to see Wally get his own RF when that story came out. I hope we eventuall see a version of him play out when Wally eventually gets his powers in the new 52. I hope Thawne puts his hand through Daniel's chest though now that he's back."
theflash,384kfn,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Mon Jun 1 20:37:48 2015 UTC,I wasn't even around to view the old Flash comics where Thane was introduced.   One thing I like about Hunter is his raw power and how he schooled the Flash family.
theflash,384kfn,Dredeuced,2,Mon Jun 1 21:47:19 2015 UTC,"Well I wasn't either really, but I had a very early interest in collecting classic Flash issues.   I think if they want to keep Daniel they could find a way to mesh his story/powers with Hunter's a bit. Wally having his biggest personal foe be his uncle could be very interesting."
theflash,384kfn,Dredeuced,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:12:13 2015 UTC,Clarriss existed before Zoom even if he wasn't outright called Reverse Flash. He had the whole inverse costume motif and everything.
theflash,384kfn,Dredeuced,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:11:30 2015 UTC,"It wasn't an inverse costume at all, it was the same as Jay's just sort of shrouded in black. Honestly it almost looks more like a printing mistake than an actual design.   To put him on the same level as Thawne is revisionist history. He was in one story, the last issue before Jay's book was canceled."
theflash,384kfn,scallycap94,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:14:32 2015 UTC,"I think you're dismissing a bit too much. The whole concept of recreating the Flash's power in some way is kind of core to Thawne and Thaddeus's schtick which Rival did first. Some concession has to be made for it being an older time in a much, much shorter lived comic, obviously, but the entire premise is ""Villain who can do what The Flash does and has a costume like his."" That's pretty damn close for a Golden Age comic. Beyond that each Reverse flash is very different anyhow."
theflash,384kfn,MartianMallCop,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:20:58 2015 UTC,"I just think the name ""Reverse Flash"" should stick with the characters it's been actually associated with. Characters like The Rival and Inertia shouldn't be given that name just because they look sort of like their respective heroes and have superspeed IMO. They have their own unique identities."
theflash,384kfn,ultimaspark,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:25:56 2015 UTC,I guess this is a difference in philosophy. You see Reverse as...what? Just whenever someone's explicitly named themselves that? I see it as what the Reverse of a Flash is -- a villainous speedster. I care less about the title and more about what they mean to respective Flash characters.

theflash,380tlb,AREYOUSauRuS,2,Mon Jun 1 11:51:31 2015 UTC,Could someone post a link to one of the better original discussions?
theflash,380tlb,AREYOUSauRuS,6,Mon Jun 1 13:14:48 2015 UTC,"Basically.  We've been seeing all of one timeline in the show.  And the reason this timeline is the way it is, is because Eobard killed Barry's mother.  With Eddie dead, Eobard will never be born and therefore never can go back and kill Barry's mother.  Since that never happens, the timeline we've been witnessing is falling apart.  Eddie created a paradox that is destroying the universe as Team Flash knows it."
theflash,380tlb,theClutchologist,2,Mon Jun 1 15:05:00 2015 UTC,So what's next?? If the timeline  can't exist because the person who creates the rift that creates said timeline never existed which is it's own paradox all together because if reverse flash never goes back how does he encourage Eddie to be a notable member of his family's tree because the biggest note of all is he prevents one of the greatest hero of our times parents from being killed which only exists because in another time line reverse flash goes back. It's all one big paradox and I could go on and on and I think that's the point and either we will see a new timeline with the same characters (and or minus Berry's mother) but if in that timeline reverse flash doesn't create our current Berry that would mean the real dr wells creates flash but not until flash is a few years older which really they could do an entire season of him with no flash powers to build character relationships and we could see the flash reborn maybe halfway through season 2 unless a flash from reverse timeline or our current Berry Allen finds a way to beat the system but who knows what that means regarding memories of current characters though while cisco is the only one experiencing memory rifts and in the end it's contributed to his exposure of the machine that creates the flash and many of his enemies could things like dreams and faded images of memories ever leak into the heads of alternate timeline characters. Could we even see Eddie again ?!?! He's noted to be neutral maybe Eddie still exists in the new time like and Flash stole his girl and encouraged him to be a hero and prevent the reverse flash from existing to save the day but it's not like the flash is gonna drop a living Eddie off a cliff because his future family are responsible for reverse flash so therefore reverse flash and real flash must always both exist because reverse flash comes after real flash and real flash will never prevent the birth of reverse flash. God I'm stoned.

SO Flash moves to the new one where his mom is alive...regrets it and wants his former life back so he looks to find a way to a similar dimension where eddie doesn't kill himself and Thawne still comes back.

theflash,37valh,ShacloneMan91,6,Sat May 30 18:18:47 2015 UTC,"First off, you have to know that there have been four people that have taken on the mantle as The Flash. They are Jay Garrick (40s-50s), Barry Allen (50s-80s, 2010-now), Wally West (80s-2010), and Bart Allen (06-07).  The two that get the most recognition are Barry Allen and Wally West. Here are some recommendations:   Barry Allen: Most of his stories are from the 50s-80s and I haven't read any of those. Just know that he sacrificed himself during Crisis on Infinite Earths and go from there.   Flash: Rebirth: This is the reintroduction of Barry to the DC Universe. It's a fantastic story and I highly recommend it. It features the Flash Family (Jay Garrick, Wally West, Bart Allen, Jesse Quick, and Max Mercury).  Dastardly Death of the Rogues: This comes right after Rebirth and Blackest Night(Green Lantern story) but it is still a Flash story. Rogues from the future come back to try and arrest Barry. It's a very fun story and I recommend it. Flashpoint: Probably the best Flash story I've ever read IMO. Major time travel consequences. If you watch the show, then you'll understand this story.  New 52 Flash series: After Flashpoint, DC did a reboot on a majority of the characters, and The Flash was one of them. This will retell the origin story of Barry Allen and explore his time as The Flash. It's a great story, and the artwork is phenomenal.   Wally West: Former Kid Flash, turned The Flash. He becomes The Flash right after the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths.   Read this list in order to get a good taste of Wally West. I read a good majority of that list and got a good understanding of the character.  I hope this helps! Have fun reading!"

theflash,37t37j,CallMeMo,12,Sat May 30 04:12:35 2015 UTC,"This is an incredible task. Well I would start with Golden Age Jay Garrick. This is the original speedster (his helmet is RFs queue to leave). Next is the silver age Barry Allen. This is the creation of our beloved character. Next is Modern Age creation of Wally West story line. This represents the pre-crisis timeline. Post Crisis is where things get really messy. Lots of multiverse and universe resets. The Crisis spans multiple years leading to Final crisis. After Final crisis there is rebirth, then Flashpoint. This will then lead to New 52>convergence >divergence?? Along with all these was Justice League material that has a lot of flash (being a founding member). Comics are only a piece of the pie. The DCAU is one of the best animated universes on television. Justice League and justice League Unlimited all have Flash storylines. Young Justice features a young wally West tutoring under Barry Allen. This is a large portion, but I am sure people will add things I forgot."
theflash,37t37j,ErwinsZombieCat,3,Sat May 30 04:46:39 2015 UTC,"You pretty much covered everything necessary, tbh. Jay and Barry stories will be significantly goofier, and the Wally ones will begin to get more serious as his post-COIE series goes on. The Mark Waid run, generally regarded as one of the best starts at, I believe, 62 in that series (but I'm probably wrong, it's around that anyway). And his series ran for a long time. Flash Rebirth brought Barry back to the forefront up until Flashpoint (which was a Barry story) and the New 52 flash (Brian Buccalleto and Francis Manapul) was phenomenal."

theflash,37k3oo,Scolor,12,Thu May 28 05:22:37 2015 UTC,"Wally had many, many more powers than Barry derived from his experience with manipulating the Speed Force. For about 7 or 8 years everyone and their mother in comics mentioned how he had surpassed Barry in basically every way as part of his long growing process. If you're going to rate who is better based on who is more powerful and more capable with the Speed Force then the answer is Wally due to experience.  I think Wally is the better Flash because he is the core character in about a dozen or more storylines that are better than any stories that revolve around Barry. This is because Wally had the great benefit of having a handful of writers excellently suited to writing him over the course of 20 years that Barry never really got. Going from Messner-Loebs -> Waid -> Morrison/Millar -> Waid -> Johns is the best 2 decade stretch any Big 2 cape hero has ever had. Wally also is The Flash in my favorite Justice League ever -- the awesome JLA that went from Morrison -> Waid -> Kelly and was excellent throughout.  Though, Barry's The Flash in my second favorite JL story which is JLA Year One by Waid, so that's something. They're both great characters when given the right writer but, if you're telling me to choose, it's Wally without a moment's hesitation. It says a lot that in the TV show and in the comics, which kind of highlight Barry's return to the spotlight, that they have ripped several parts of Wally's history and cast and stitched it onto Barry."
theflash,37k3oo,Dredeuced,2,Thu May 28 12:01:20 2015 UTC,That's great! This is exactly the type of answer I was looking for. Thank you!
theflash,37k3oo,AcademicalSceptic,2,Thu May 28 13:27:34 2015 UTC,Is vibrating through things without blowing them up the only one Barry can do that Wally never gets the hang of?
theflash,37k3oo,Dredeuced,3,Thu May 28 15:32:10 2015 UTC,"Wally got over the ""Things I vibrate through explode"" thing after the Black Flash arc. Like one time he vibrated some bombs out of a couple of Rogues' necks or vibrated Plas through a wall etc etc.  It's harder for him but he can still do it.  That said, Barry IS better at vibrating than him, or atleast more consistent at it. Wally can still vibrate to different dimensions and universes without the Cosmic Treadmill (Unlike Barry), but couldn't do ultra fine things like recreate Barry's Anti Matter Cannon vibrations because it required incredible precision -- when he tried he caused it to explode because his vibrations were too powerful/rapid, unlike Barry who made it implode. Wally has done a lot of stuff Barry never got the chance to do, so who knows if Barry could.  So it's give and take I guess."
theflash,37k3oo,AcademicalSceptic,1 point,Thu May 28 16:47:09 2015 UTC,"I remember the Antimatter Cannon explosion. Doesn't Barry (with Wally's guidance) travel back in time sans treadmill in Rebirth?  And yeah, I imagine Barry could learn how to do a lot of the stuff Wally did. He just wasn't the Flash at the time it was all being invented."
theflash,37k3oo,Dredeuced,2,Thu May 28 16:53:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Wally kind of half teaches Barry how to do it but even during Blackest Night, after Rebirth, Barry mentions how he's not really good at impromptu time travel without the treadmill. He could only manage a short little time travel hop into the future to escape a black ring. The Anti Matter Cannon for Wally was with Chain Lightning -- Barry died prematurely so Wally tried to take his place, but failed because his Speed Force connection floods his vibrations with too much power and not enough fine control.  Barry, presumably, could do anything Wally does and Wally, presumably, could do anything Barry does with enough practice. Their power is the same. The only difference might come from how powerfully or precisely they could do it. For instance, Wally taught Jay Garrick how to speed steal. While Jay uses the power from time to time, he's not doing the insane things Wally could like permanently freezing someone in stasis or speed stealing the entire Earth so it stops moving through space.  Wally's whole thing is an excess flooding of power from the Speed Force so he's faster than everyone else, his abilities tend to have more oomph (aforementioned speed stealing and phasing examples) and more insulated to anti Speed Force effects ala Speed Steal, as shown in the Savitar arc."
theflash,37k3oo,AcademicalSceptic,2,Thu May 28 17:17:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's true – it's still ""guesswork at best"" for him. And yeah, I imagine in principle they can do much the same stuff, but then again Jesse Quick could fly and didn't that come from the Speed Force?  Isn't the freezing of Inertia a moment of hyper-connection to the Speed Force?"
theflash,37k3oo,Dredeuced,2,Thu May 28 17:25:35 2015 UTC,"It's a moment where Wally got pissed enough to use his powers to their potential. He's made that kind of comment before, like when he fought Cobalt Blue or Savitar. Just like when he punched the Anti Monitor's armor to smithereens or speed stole the planet or a million other crazy things. Wally doesn't normally operate at those levels of energy because it's dangerous -- too much of that kind of power and he becomes more and more inhuman as shown in Waid's arc.   Wally has a lot of power but doesn't like to use it because he'll lose what's most important to him in the process if he pushes too far too often."
theflash,37k3oo,AcademicalSceptic,1 point,Thu May 28 17:49:43 2015 UTC,"When does he start becoming more and more inhuman? Is that a particular arc or a sort of overarching theme in Waid's run?  OK, I see. Yeah, that smashing of the Anti-Monitor's armour is a pretty brutal cutting loose. You get a sense of despair with the way he's pulling out the stops."
theflash,37k3oo,Dredeuced,2,Thu May 28 17:56:40 2015 UTC,"It's established during Terminal Velocity, right after he first stats being able to approach and surpass light speed. It brings the dual problem of the Speed Force biting back and ""absorbing"" him (which he eventually masters resisting, and thus doesn't have to worry about anymore -- the aforementioned helping Barry scene included this, as Wally had become an expert at navigating the dangers of the Speed Force) and also him becoming more inhuman. The most notable example was in #95-96 when he was literally turning into a being composed entirely of Speed Force energy and needed Linda right there to help him will himself back to humanity. The entire thing was kind of a sub-plot to Wally becoming more and more addicted to the power the Speed Force was granting him.  The concept is also revisited in The Flash 80 Page Giant #2(or atleast that's where I remember reading it) which is a super comic with lots of little story arcs. Jenny Ognats looks back in time and sees one of Wally's possible future selves become entirely separated and unconcerned with human life until he sacrifices himself at the end due to briefly regaining his humanity."
theflash,37k3oo,elbruce,5,Thu May 28 18:14:33 2015 UTC,"Everything Wally knows he learned from Barry.  He can't get out of that shadow, no matter what he does.  But I'm still waiting to hear that Joe has a nephew..."
theflash,37k3oo,AREYOUSauRuS,6,Fri May 29 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, we ignore Jay he is not in the same league as the others.  Sorry, Jay, still love ya.  There's Barry, Wally, and Bart to consider.  They each are the best... in one way or another.  Barry is the source of the speed force.  This means anyone using the speed force is technically using Barry's power.  This means Barry has the most power.  Wally on the other hand... he has so much more experience than anyone else using the speedforce.  He gained his powers at 12 and was in his 30's with kids by the time he got rebooted.  He learned how to use different speed force powers, powers Barry never showed to be able to use even after coming back from death.  Making him by far the most experienced and capable with the speed force.   But... you have to remember... anything Wally can do is actually stemming from Barry's powers.  Bart's the remaining one.  You might wonder how Bart can be the best in one way... when I already announced Barry the most powerful and Wally the most experienced.  Well, Bart had the most potential.  This was told to us several times by Barry and Wally and Max (the zen master of speed).  Bart is the only speedster able to retain knowledge learned at super speed.  Being a descendant of Barry, it's possible that Bart also generates speedforce just like Barry, but we never got to delve much into what gave Bart the potential to be the greatest as so many other speedsters knew he had because he died so early into his career.  So... tl;dr:  Barry-most powerful.  Wally-most experienced.  Bart-most potential."
theflash,37k3oo,Dredeuced,-1,Thu May 28 21:36:46 2015 UTC,Barry doesn't generate the Speed Force anymore and saying Bart would generate the Speed Force because he's related is quite the stretch.
theflash,37k3oo,AREYOUSauRuS,1 point,Fri May 29 12:39:35 2015 UTC,"Barry doesn't generate the Speed Force anymore   Oh, are we speaking only of new52?  Then Barry is clearly the winner because Bart no longer exists, only Bar Tor and he was a travesty.  And the current time Wally has no powers.   saying Bart would generate the Speed Force    I didn't say he would, I said possibly, I gave a possible reason for why Barry, Wally, and Max all claimed that Bart had more potential than any other speedster.  I don't know why you're trying to nitpick me, I think my original post was very clear and there is no definitive answer besides Barry is the one DC will always try to push more, so even though it'll fluctuate depending on the story currently being told, it'll always get rebooted down to Barry eventually.  edit: If you wanna nitpick me.... Make an argument for Jay since in the new52 he's way different than pre-fp.  He's got the powers of a god now, there's probably a valid argument for him now a days."
theflash,37k3oo,Dredeuced,1 point,Fri May 29 12:45:55 2015 UTC,"Well, the ""generate the Speed Force"" thing was a retcon that lasted for about 2 years. Barry never did anything in that time frame to make him the most powerful. It's just kind of a non-point. It's weird to say but Wally was defined, powerwise, by his overwhelming connection to the Speed Force that flooded him with too much power -- this is why he had more difficult vibrating than Barry despite being a much more experienced Speed Force user. Barry never had the problem of too much energy flooding his body. He produces it, it becomes the Speed Force, then he accesses that pool of power he had -- this is why guys like Cobalt Blue and Hot Pursuit could drain him completely without the Speed Force disappearing. People seem to attribute him making the Speed Force to being the most powerful but that's not really the case. He doesn't have complete control over The Speed Force, that was shown explicitly in Rebirth. He was as subject to the Speed Force's dangers as anyone else and had the same kind of powers he always had -- second to Wally like everyone had said for about a decade prior.  Barry never had the ""too much power"" issue despite ostensibly being the one who generated the energy, but the main point is that Barry was never more powerful than Wally since his return. If anything, everything you said about Barry is about the potential he has as the progenitor, not the outright power he could display.  I don't think Bart generating The Speed Force is plausible. It was a really unique thing to Barry because it's how they tied Barry's importance as a historical figure to the powers speedsters have. Bart has no narrative point for that and it's a bit of unjustified speculation. Bart's potential is talked up for many, many reasons and none of them have to do with being Barry's grandson and generating the Speed Force himself. His prodigious speed at a young age? Yep. His unique powers other Speedsters don't even understand? Absolutely! Generating The Speed Force? I don't think so. Basically, I agree with your point but disagree with the logic that got you there.  This is a nitpicky thread. It's about sussing out the differences between the Flashes. If you don't nitpick their differences then there's...no point.  New 52 Jay is connected to the Speed Force like the other Speedsters, oddly. Maybe that's what made Mercury so fast. Pre-Crisis Barry DID say he might be faster than him, which is quite the claim and says a lot about New 52 Jay. Though, New 52 Jay hasn't done too much (he did Speed Force dump one of Darkseid's minions, tho Barry has Speed Force dumped a dozen people at this point, heh).   I wasn't really arguing that DC is pushing Barry -- that's obvious, he's the current Flash. I don't think that's ever been a justification for who's better, though. It doesn't always reboot to Barry...It first rebooted from Jay to Barry, then to Wally, then Wally survived a pseudo-reboot (Zero Hour), then ""rebooted"" to Bart(depending on how you view Infinite Crisis), who got replaced by Wally, who got replaced by Barry without a reboot. Barry was just The Flash at the time of the latest reboot so he carried over, much like how Wally carried over with COIE and ZH. It's been more causal than push based."
theflash,37k3oo,AREYOUSauRuS,1 point,Fri May 29 13:08:34 2015 UTC,"You're speculating in yours too.  You're assuming Wally's lightning transformation is different from Barry's lightning transformation.  It could be the same thing, except Wally controlled it better... because Wally has more experience.  There's lots of speculation done when comparing characters because the companies try hard to avoid the topic with mind control and shit like that.  And it's not fair for you to dismiss him generating the speed force because they stopped talking about it.  Just because they didn't mention it in the following stories doesn't mean it's not true.  Did Wally ""overload"" on speed force in his last story?  Oh, no?  Then it was clearly retconned....  whatever.  I'm a bigger Wally fan than Barry, myself.  But you seem like you really need to prove Wally better for some reason.  Without Barry, there would be no Wally."
theflash,37k3oo,Dredeuced,0,Fri May 29 13:23:28 2015 UTC,"I never mentioned Wally's lightning transformation. I don't know why you brought it up. I said Wally's connection to the Speed Force is more powerful which was said...dozens of times? Regardless, it was certainly said and shown enough times to be an obvious fact. This isn't about experience. Wally gained a closer connection than ANYONE IN HISTORY after Terminal Velocity. That's the entire point of the story arc. Barry never had the same power influx that Wally had. Even after Rebirth he didn't. That's why he's less powerful but has finer control over his powers (thus the reason he doesn't have problems vibrating -- his body isn't over saturated with Speed Force energy). That's why Cobalt Blue and Hot Pursuit could drain him -- he doesn't have the entirety of the Speed Force's energy in him at one time. Think of Barry as a faucet slowly filling up a reservoir (the Speed Force is that resevoir). Barry can open a tap and get some of that reservoir back like every other Speedster. Wally's has the most intense tap and it's hard to control without it spraying Speed Force everywhere.  I dismissed him generating the Speed Force because it doesn't affect anything. I mentioned it only lasted 2 years because, in those 2 years, they never did anything with this new found level of power you're implying Barry has. Then he wasn't the progenitor anymore. That's just how it happened, I'm not saying these things out of spite or to be unfair...I just read the books. Nothing they did ever contradicted all the years Wally had as The Flash. The reason I even said what I said is, when you said it, you used the present tense. If you had said ""Pre-52 Barry generated the Speed Force"" then, sure. It doesn't really make Barry more powerful or anything but that'd be true. I was giving you a minor correction that you've seemed to take to heart. I apologize if I upset you when I did it.  What do you mean Wally overloading? Wally's last story was dying from being shot then blowing up to save the Speed Force/Timeline or whatever. He didn't overload, he was going to die so he sacrificed himself first. Not that New 52 Wally is...anything, really. Atleast Barry has freaking done something.  This isn't about me being a bigger fan of whoever. I am stating observations made from reading pretty much every Flash comic since the 80s. I disagree with your points. That you devolve this into some rhetoric about me playing favorites is silly. My point was never ""I like Wally more so he's better."" My point was ""This is what happened during the last 20 years and here's my logic justifying it."""
theflash,37k3oo,Dredeuced,0,Fri May 29 13:44:46 2015 UTC,"Yes. I spoke of Wally's lightning transformation in a different thread. It has literally nothing to do with what I'm saying. Wally's lightning transformation happened BEFORE he started having problems with his phasing blowing things up. It was BEFORE he became so flooded with Speed Force energy that no one could recreate his level of power.  ""Eat a dick."" Wow. Okay. I'm just gonna leave you alone after this. If you can't have this conversation without that kind of language then you need to rethink using Reddit. This is a pretty tame disagreement. I didn't say ""You didn't read the comics."" I said that was my conclusion from reading the comics.  I didn't pick and choose crap. I acknowledge Rebirth. It just...didn't do anything to change any of the stuff I said. You seem to equate Barry being the origin of the Speed Force with being more powerful than everyone else but there's...literally nothing to show that. I didn't ""only accept"" the New 52. If I only accepted the New 52 then I wouldn't even mention Wally or Bart. I pointed out how Rebirth and Volume 3 showed nothing of Barry being more powerful than Wally or, heck, even more powerful than Bart, really. Rebirth's retcon lasted 2 years in which nothing you're implying was shown."
theflash,37k3oo,AREYOUSauRuS,0,Fri May 29 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"""Eat a dick.""    I'll say it again, because you're an idiot.

Eat a dick."
theflash,37k3oo,Dredeuced,0,Fri May 29 18:05:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't say ""I read the comics."" and end my statement. If you would've happened to freaking read my post you'd notice that, immediately after I said ""I just read the books."" I followed it up by establishing that said reading of the books leads me to this conclusion. If you're upset that I put a period at the end of said statement before leading into another sentence that builds off what I said then I don't know what to tell you, dude. You need some thicker skin and the ability to take in context before immediately jumping to being offended.  I'm sorry if that upset you but you are being way, way too defensive. You're actively trying to be insulted even when I explain myself."
theflash,37k3oo,AREYOUSauRuS,1 point,Fri May 29 18:20:19 2015 UTC,"BTW, about the ""reboots,"" since we're in a nitpicky mood.  Jay to Barry wasn't a reboot in the terms of reboots.  Flash was cancelled, super heroes in comics were dying.  They decided to give superheroes another shot in Showcase#4 with Barry Allen and they started to do well again and created the silver age.  It wasn't a reboot, it was completely separate.  And technically Barry->Flash storyline has never truly rebooted.  Silver age to current is all one storyline.  Barry never rebooted.  He died in CoIE, Wally took over.  It didn't reboot.  There wasn't a reboot to Flash in Zero Hour either.  Then Bart wasn't a reboot, he took over the mantle, continued the story.  And when Barry came back, again not a reboot, just continuation from silver age and on.  Flashpoint is the closest part of a reboot, but it's not even a real reboot.  Barry in new52 is same Barry from pre-fp just with his memories adjusted to the new timeline."
theflash,37k3oo,Dredeuced,0,Fri May 29 18:51:53 2015 UTC,"I'll say focusing your stories on an entirely different universe counts as a reboot, even if there was no event leading up to it. They completely redid their entire comics line. It was more of a reboot than even COIE was.  You're right that it's technically the same storyline as soon as Flash of Two Worlds happened but that's not really the point. Barry was the updated, rebooted Flash.   The Flash comic line rebooted. That's why it changed from Volume 1 to Volume 2. If you don't think changing volumes after the quintessential reboot story of all time isn't a reboot then I don't know what to say. Yes, there were storyline reasons that caused it to happen that included Barry dying. Just like there were storyline reasons that caused Flashpoint. The fact that there is story behind a rebooting of a title with a new Flash doesn't make it not a reboot.  Bart was most certainly a reboot. It's very obviously so. After Johns left, the Flash title was floundering in sales. DC decided to change things up. They got rid of the Speed Force temporarily in IC and brought it back with Bart as The Flash on a new Flash title. Infinite Crisis also brought back the multiverse and expanded the line to a bunch of new stories. A plethora of titles swapped and changed over following it. I'm not sure what you qualify as a reboot but you seem to think that, as long as there's a story behind it, nothing ever reboots.  Barry in the New 52 is not the same, actually. He's younger, less experienced, has mildly different powers. Barry was affected by the reboot just as much as everyone else (in some cases, more, like with the Lanterns) despite being the catalyst in the storytelling that caused it. Heck the Speed Force is entirely different, for one, and Barry's affiliation with the Speed Force is entirely different -- instead of its progenitor he acts as a release valve for its energy. How can he be the same if he's...not the same?  It's not just his memories, the timeline change affected him on a fundamental level like it did everyone."
theflash,37k3oo,AREYOUSauRuS,1 point,Fri May 29 13:28:29 2015 UTC,"The Flash comic line rebooted. That's why it changed from Volume 1 to Volume 2.   Different titles/volumes don't indicate a reboot, that's ignorant.  I already addressed how Barry Allen's story is never rebooted.  All changes have been part of the story through time travel/speed force shananigans.   Bart was most certainly a reboot.    What?  LOL.    Each Title/Volume isn't it's own continuity necessary.  If that were true Action Comics, Adventures of Superman, Superman, and Superman: Man of Steel were all different versions even though they led into each other each week back then too."
theflash,37k3oo,Dredeuced,0,Fri May 29 13:39:09 2015 UTC,"When you scrap the previous title and replace the main character you are rebooting the title. It was a reboot when Kyle replaced Hal, too. It was a reboot when Barry replaced Wally in Rebirth. These aren't company wide reboots but even the creators themselves will call it a reboot or a ""reworking"" of the title when they make these changes. You can reboot a title without rebooting the universe. Sometimes both happen at the same time (COiE and Flash Volume 2 is a good example).  I didn't say they were their own continuity. I don't get why you think that's a requirement. Zero Hour rebooted a ton of shit and it was the same continuity. Infinite Crisis rebooted a ton of shit and it was the same continuity. Hell, technically, COIE -- the tried and true staple giant reboot -- kept large swathes of the continuity. Are you gonna tell me COIE wasn't a reboot? Flashpoint rebooted all sorts of continuity but other things remained the same like a large chunk of the Bat and GL mythos, but it was clearly a reboot, right?  I don't understand why this point is hard to grasp."
theflash,37k3oo,AREYOUSauRuS,1 point,Fri May 29 17:21:31 2015 UTC,"rebooting the title   does not mean rebooting the continuity.  When Bart took over Wally's story wasn't rebooted.  When Wally took over, Barry's story wasn't rebooted."
theflash,37k3oo,Dredeuced,0,Fri May 29 18:05:21 2015 UTC,"Rebooting doesn't have to get rid of all continuity, dude. Crisis On Infinite Earths, the end all be all reboot of all reboots, didn't completely reset continuity. No reboot has ever completely reset continuity.  Bart taking over for Wally WAS a reboot of The Flash title. The creators even called it that. They specifically said, leading up to and after Rebirth ""We had rebooted The Flash title multiple times and nothing was working."" The word reboot doesn't mean ""erase everything prior and start from scratch.""   When you vastly upend a title, often following with a volume/paradigm shift, that's a reboot. I don't get where you think there's a need for the ongoing universal storyline to no longer exist for something to be a reboot. If that's the case then DC has literally never rebooted anything ever in your eyes because they're literally referencing a bunch of pre crisis stuff that still exists right now in the comics."

Barry should be his own character, not someone who needs Wally's 20 year old plot hooks and living situations dumped onto him.  Next thing you know he'll win the lottery.  It's amusing to know he has crippling student loan debts, so bad that he can't afford his own place, despite the fact that a couple of weeks ago he went about bribing a convict for the rest of his life to lie to Wally.  The long and short of it is, like everything else under this creative team, it's a giant mess."

So it seems they changed it."

My theory is that Barry won't be able to do anything to the black hole, instead somehow travel through it to another universe.

theflash,371ifd,sgb5874,1 point,Sun May 24 15:33:43 2015 UTC,My theory on whats going to happen is sort of similar to yours But when Barry goes back in time to save his mom and encounters himself (future Barry) Future Barry has Guidian in that timeline which could be what alerted future Barry to present Barrys existance. When this happens Future barry is advised to tell present Barry not to interfere in order so that present Barry would get enraged enough to go back and fight Wells (Thawne) and set fourth the events that lead us to Eddie shooting himself and erasing both of them from existence. Now just like when Barry tried to stop the Tsunami from happening I think this time instead of going back in time hes going to jump ahead in time to the future where the wormhole almost destroyed Central city and its going to mess up a lot in that timeline. The rest involves Barry having to find a way to undo him not allowing wells to return to the future and Eddie shooting himself. On the other hand traveling around the blackhole might reset him back to a certain date in the past which would reset the show and I really hope they dont take that route because its not as cool.

So many things can't exist or rather should exist after Eddie's monkey wrench; so it's wiping out their timeline because of this. Barry will probably end up in an alternate one - one where a lot of things are different. Grant himself said there will be multiple timelines in season 2, so that's my best guess."

theflash,36yyxd,TheeLazyCanadian,2,Mon May 25 07:32:24 2015 UTC,"The character is supposed to be returning, same with Eddie. They're going to be doing some Multiverse stuff in season two so the Eddie and Harrison that we're going to see in S2 will most likely be from an alternate timeline. That could also be a way for them to use the Killer Frost character without making Caitlin Snow a villain, It would also put Cisco's meta human abilities to use seeing as he can sense when the timeline has changed.

theflash,36yyxd,HappinessIsAWarmPoop,2,Sat May 23 15:45:12 2015 UTC,"He rebooted the entire DC multiverse by accident in 2011   It wasn't accident, Pandora combined timelines while Barry was fixing his own universe and that caused the DC reboot."

theflash,36xywg,AREYOUSauRuS,1 point,Sat May 23 14:13:38 2015 UTC,Also in universe the death of theD Flash preceded the transformation of the Justice League into the Justice Lords.
theflash,36w6cs,Scolor,25,Fri May 22 16:56:52 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent explanation and spot on.   The only thing that bothers me is that Eobard is from a different timeline anyway! One where Wells doesn't die, the particle accelerator/creation of the flash happens in 2020, and Eddie doesn't kill himself (obviously).  Eobard is the one who created this new timeline, so anything that happens in it shouldn't affect him retroactively. Unless, of course, there is only one time stream that can be changed via time travel, in which case the black hole wouldn't be trying to destroy everything, but instead change a bunch of shit a la Flashpoint"
theflash,36w6cs,spacepilot_3000,4,Fri May 22 18:55:36 2015 UTC,Was it confirmed that Barry gets his powers in 2020 from (real)Wells' particle accelerator?
theflash,36w6cs,DaveMeowthews41,8,Fri May 22 21:30:49 2015 UTC,Wasn't that the whole point of Thawne saying he couldn't wait that long and making it happen sooner? Why would he choose to build the particle accelerator years early and then blow it up if that's not how Barry became the flash in his timeline?
theflash,36w6cs,spacepilot_3000,5,Fri May 22 21:43:38 2015 UTC,"Because he was draining speed force to power himself.  The speed force is only as strong as Barry builds it up.  He created the metahuman villains to force Barry to build up the speed force faster.  Also to use it for Barry to open the wormhole.  A possibility, not a fact.  It's unconfirmed the exact reasons why he moved up the accelerator besides ""to go home sooner"""
theflash,36w6cs,AREYOUSauRuS,3,Fri May 22 23:26:28 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. I just meant that's a crazy idea to come up with unless he knew beforehand that the particle accelerator meltdown would create the flash (and other meta humans)   But... Comics so yeah.   Edit: in the finale he definitely tells Barry he caused the meltdown to create the Flash, which would lead me to believe that's how it happened in his own timeline"
theflash,36w6cs,spacepilot_3000,5,Fri May 22 23:33:00 2015 UTC,"The belief with that theory is that Barry's power didn't come from the accelerator, it came from the lightning + chemicals, like in the comics, and Eobard timed the accelerator with when Flash gains his powers as a misdirection so he can take the blame for Barry's accident and get close to him.  It convinced Joe to let Barry be taken to Star Labs."
theflash,36w6cs,AREYOUSauRuS,3,Fri May 22 23:36:28 2015 UTC,"Ooohhh that was totally lost on me. I was under the impression that the show was just going with ""the particle accelerator did it"" meaning that Thawne effectively created the Flash early in order to leech of the speed force, and the rest was kind of a calculated bonus"
theflash,36w6cs,spacepilot_3000,2,Fri May 22 23:42:30 2015 UTC,"You are correct. That makes complete sense! How else would they have Wally have the same lightning accident? Have another particle accelerator meltdown? Of course not. The lightning, baby!!! :)"
theflash,36w6cs,lalosuper3001,1 point,Fri May 22 23:50:35 2015 UTC,Couldn't Eobard have recreated the conditions for speed force ability for himself rather than Barry? Wouldn't that have been better since he won't need to depend on Flash's ability when he can have his own access to the speed force
theflash,36w6cs,mrawesomesausage,1 point,Sat May 23 02:31:22 2015 UTC,"If the accelerator was the true reason for the creation of the Flash, you would assume so."
theflash,36w6cs,AREYOUSauRuS,1 point,Sat May 23 02:52:54 2015 UTC,"Responding to your edit.   he definitely tells Barry he caused the meltdown to create the Flash   He does.  But that's kinda vague.  First off, The Flash is Barry.  His mother and father created him.  So, what does he mean by create the Flash?  Give Barry powers?  Or push Barry into being a costumed vigilante?  It's a fact that he pushed Barry into being a costumed vigilante in this universe, so that could be what he's referring to.  Not to mention, at that point you can't take Eobard's words for facts.  He's talking to Barry, he's been manipulating them from the get go, and he's still after his ultimate goal, so he could still be manipulating.  Ask yourself what is more reasonable out of these two scenarios:    Eobard activated the particle accelerator five years early, then blew it up, and even though it was 5 years too soon and it blew up instead of being successful(since he told Wells it was successful in the original timeline and had no reason to lie to Wells), it still caused a lightning bolt to strike Barry the same way it did in the original timeline.  Which would imply a shit ton of luck since Eobard had changed so much of the event.  Or...  Eobard activates the accelerator 5 years early to time it with the lightning bolt strike he knows is going to happen, and then use that to manipulate Joe into letting Barry come to Star Labs.  Then ""create the Flash"" by supporting him into starting his crime fighting career, and then later manipulate Barry and Cisco and others into thinking he's ""not really a bad guy"" by reminding them that he ""gave"" them all these wonderful powers and all he wants to do is go home... they gotta understand that desire."
theflash,36w6cs,AREYOUSauRuS,1 point,Sat May 23 13:19:15 2015 UTC,"Idk it seems like you're really reaching to flesh out a story that wouldn't really move the plot of the show forward at all.   Not trying to shit on your opinions, you've definitely put thought into it, but I'm not sure I agree"
theflash,36w6cs,spacepilot_3000,2,Sat May 23 14:30:38 2015 UTC,"That's fine.  Everytime I address it, I try to make sure to point out that it's only a theory because nothing in the show has proven either way.  I just feel that my way brings it closer to the comic with the origin and clears up what I see as gaping plot holes in the more widely accepted theory of the accelerator being the source of the powers.  But, unless they re-address his origin next season when he's dimension hopping, we'll never know."
theflash,36w6cs,AREYOUSauRuS,2,Sat May 23 14:37:52 2015 UTC,I think he's from even a different timeline than that. Because he wouldn't have existed originally in the 2020 universe because he's from many centuries in the future.
theflash,36w6cs,sirthunt,1 point,Fri May 22 22:25:06 2015 UTC,"Good point, since he's time traveled at least twice (once from the future and again to Barrys childhood and the current timeline) this would be his third timeline in the show. So none of it should change his history!"

theflash,36w6cs,PolkHighPanthers,3,Fri May 22 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"I like to think of time travel having milestones. For example, if Eobard never killed Barry's mom, then maybe she would've died some other way and Barry's dad been sent/gone away and Barry to live with Joe and Iris, anyway.  Also, Eobard came back and built the particle accelerator which gave Barry his powers. However, when our current Barry was a child and saw his mother die, future (adult) Barry/Flash was trying to save her.   In the future's timeline, Eobard never came back to create the accelerator, therefore future Barry got his power differently than present Barry.  You can say things like Cisco dying/not dying based on the time travel is irrelevant to the great nature of the World. But Barry getting his powers and his mother dying definitely is."
theflash,36w6cs,DaveMeowthews41,3,Fri May 22 20:41:07 2015 UTC,"Future Flash wasn't trying to save her, he was trying to correct the timeline to get rid of the black hole.   We'll probably see that scene first thing next season, except his role will be reversed."
theflash,36w6cs,No_Morals,1 point,Sat May 23 06:27:39 2015 UTC,"Future Barry presumably got his powers when Professor Wells built the particle accelerator with his wife, ten years later. Eobard Thawne killed Wells and took over his life in order to bring about that even sooner."
theflash,36w6cs,beauchamp_not_beaton,5,Sat May 23 05:08:30 2015 UTC,"It has been referenced in the past in the comics that the actions taken by individuals connected to the Speedforce in the past have lasting repercussions, regardless of outcome.   Think of things this way : Thawne is from Universe A. In Universe A, Eddie has offspring, which include Thawne. Harrison Wells creates the particle accelerator in 2020, which gives Barry Allen his powers. Barry Allen becomes The Flash and Thawne's arch-nemesis. Thawne decides to travel back in time, kill Barry Allen as a child, and be done with it.   Thawne travels back in time. At this point, he is still in Universe A. Barry, realizing Thawne's plan, travels back in time as well to save himself as a child. The moment Thawne attacks the Allens, he creates an alternate universe, Universe B. Barry saves himself, in his frustration, Thawne murders Nora Allen. None of these events create a new universe : we are still in Universe B, as the action that gave rise to this new timeline was Thawne attacking Barry as a child, which obviously never happened to Barry in Universe A. Everything after Thawne's initial attack is all new.   If Thawne had attacked Barry, killed him, and then traveled forward in time to the year he had left, he would have traveled forward in time in Universe B. The moment Thawne left his own time and attacked the Allens, he could not return to his own universe.   We know what happens to Thawne in Universe B. However, all of the things Thawne did in the past leading up to his defeat by Barry and the death of Eddie - murdering Nora Allen, murdering Harrison Wells, sabotaging the particle accelerator, those things are not erased by Thawne's death due to Thawne's connection to the speed force.   Edit : The real kicker is that Barry also abandoned Universe A when he saved himself from Thawne - when the two Barrys see one another in the finale, that is the Barry of Universe B looking at the Future Barry of Universe B. When Barry of Universe A left his time to return to the past, saving himself from Thawne means that he has changed his own past. The moment Thawne attacks the Allens, Barry in tow, Barry from Universe A irrevocably becomes Barry from Universe B. Effectively, Universe A freezes and ""ends"" the moment Thawne and Barry depart for the past and create Universe B."

They are Jay Garrick (40s-60s), Barry Allen (60s-80s, 2010-now), Wally West (80s-2010), and Bart Allen (06-07).  The two that get the most recognition are Barry Allen and Wally West. Here are some recommendations:   Barry Allen: Most of his stories are from the 60s-80s and I haven't read any of those. Just know that he sacrificed himself during Crisis on Infinite Earths and go from there.   Flash: Rebirth: This is the reintroduction of Barry to the DC Universe. It's a fantastic story and I highly recommend it. It features the Flash Family (Jay Garrick, Wally West, Bart Allen, Jesse Quick, and Max Mercury).  Dastardly Death of the Rogues: This comes right after Rebirth and Blackest Night(Green Lantern story) but it is still a Flash story. Rogues from the future come back to try and arrest Barry. It's a very fun story and I recommend it. Flashpoint: Probably the best Flash story I've ever read IMO. Major time travel consequences. If you watch the show, then you'll understand this story.  New 52 Flash series: After Flashpoint, DC did a reboot on a majority of the characters, and The Flash was one of them. This will retell the origin story of Barry Allen and explore his time as The Flash. It's a great story, and the artwork is phenomenal.   Wally West: Former Kid Flash, turned The Flash.

Dastardly Death of the Rogues: This comes right after Rebirth and Blackest Night(Green Lantern story) but it is still a Flash story. Rogues from the future come back to try and arrest Barry. It's a very fun story and I recommend it. Flashpoint: Probably the best Flash story I've ever read IMO. Major time travel consequences. If you watch the show, then you'll understand this story.  New 52 Flash series: After Flashpoint, DC did a reboot on a majority of the characters, and The Flash was one of them. This will retell the origin story of Barry Allen and explore his time as The Flash. It's a great story, and the artwork is phenomenal.   Wally West: Former Kid Flash, turned The Flash. He becomes The Flash right after the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths.   Read this list in order to get a good taste of Wally West. I read a good majority of that list and got a good understanding of the character.  I hope this helps! Have fun reading!"

So in the show Eobard is born in 2151, and at that time The Flash is long dead. But his legacy is not, he has his own museum in fact. Eobard studies about The Flash and the Speedforce. And then gives himself powers and goes back in time to 2020+ to meet him.   This is where something happens, that makes Eobard hate The Flash. They become enemies and Eobard wants to kill The Flash. This is where they start fighting ""for centuries"". Eobard travels back and forward in time and battles The Flash throughout his life.   Eventually he finds out that The Flash is Barry Allan. And then in 2024 he starts his ""kill him as a kid"" plan, which then fails and then the events of season 1 starts."

theflash,36wsw3,gen66,11,Fri May 22 19:39:43 2015 UTC,"As someone else has said, his size and how far away he is has a large effect on what is seen.  Your points about jets and meteors are completely different, given the scale, jets are generally a mile or 2 (i dont know exactly how far up) in the sky, so your field of vision adjusts for its speed. Also, jets will very rarely go past the speed of sound in an area where there are civilians, because the sonic boom can be quite dangerous if too close to people/buildings.  Your second example, is a meteor, that is a moot point, yes, they are travelling thousands of miles per hour, but, they are in space, which is infinitely large, and when we see them, our field of vision is millions of miles wide, so, irrelevant.  Now onto Barry, him going that ""slow"" and still appearing as a blur is very believable on the scale its shown in. Quick example, wave your hand fast in front of your face, its blurry, right? thats because its moving fast enough, at a small enough distance that your eyes cant keep up, so just generates multiple images. In the case of Barry, he's going a lot faster, sometimes at the same sort of distance, its perfectly understandable that all that an eye would pick up is a blur, as the human eye cannot compute data that quickly, so all it catches is a blur.  Now, I'm going to assume you are not a physicist, as you've used the word ""imagine"" quite a bit, as you are not a physicist, please don't try and make yourself out to be smarter than the creators of this show, who more than likely have scientists on hand to advise them, given how much of the science they use is correct."
theflash,36wsw3,innistrad,-12,Fri May 22 23:48:26 2015 UTC,"Ok, I posted in physics now, just waiting for an answer so you can see I'm right :) Also go youtube and see some jets with Mach 1 or 2 , you can clearly see them in around  50-100 meters away, usually videos are above the ocean/sea, so, yeah, you can see them without huge field of vision. I get your argument about the distance, size and field of vision but I'm sure it won't hold up, that's why I even asked a question in Physics , which will completely prove the bs in the series in regards to this. Cheers. I may not be smarter in many other areas but it's this just common sense, and what makes me angry is that yes they do have scientists etc and they still failed in regards to that, that's the annoying surprise."

Anyway, it seems that the size of a human going mach 1 or 2 past next to you, we will be able to see that for sure visually, if it's a smaller object like a rugby ball, you may not see it with a mach 2 if it passes next to you. Fighter jets with Mach 3 you can easily see them even if they fly super close to you. But Mach 2 human size object is much slower than shown in the series, so they could have increased the mach number a bit..."
theflash,36wsw3,Fiend1138,5,Sun May 31 09:42:07 2015 UTC,"Indeed, in terms of speed measurement the Flash has failed big time.  The only plot savior here is Speed Force. Only when surrounded by these particles does the ""time travel at mach 2"" hold any ground."
theflash,36wsw3,Fiend1138,1 point,Fri May 22 19:59:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah but, what's the problem with telling the actual speed then when he's surrounded by these particles? Or just say, MACH 2 with speed force ( which would mean something much much more than mach2) , but no, they said MACH 2, that's a fail, I don't even consider this a plot savior :( It's just lame script and that's it.

theflash,36wsw3,Fiend1138,1 point,Fri May 22 20:15:24 2015 UTC,"Well as much as I read about the Speed Force, can someone explain him what exactly happens then and what's his actual speed in real life when using the Speed Force? Because they said MACH 2, which means MACH 2. What's the point? IF the speed force gives more power why not just say the actual speed he is going? Usually when the Flash is going fast in the comics and if someone will comment his speed, they use exact numbers but never anything around mach 2, that's just lame."
theflash,36wsw3,soldiercross,3,Fri May 22 20:35:41 2015 UTC,"Because comic book writers aren't physicists so they use Speed Force as a general umbrella to explain the goings on when it comes to The Flash.    Look at it like this then, the DeLorean only had to hit 88mph before the Flux Compacitor kicked in to allow Mary to time travel, so in this instance Barry had to reach Mach 2 before the Speed Force kicked in allowing him to time travel.    At least that's my head cannon, I don't know, I'm not a scientist nor am I a comic book writer. I'm just a guy sitting on Reddit when I should be working..."
theflash,36wsw3,Shangheli,-1,Fri May 22 20:44:06 2015 UTC,"HAha ok, fair enough, BUT!!! How come in many other instances he was going obviously above Mach 2, (e.g. when fixing a room) , and didn't activate the speed force :( What I'm saying is that his default speed when we see him in many instances logic dictates is huge amount above mach 2, they could've just chosen some other mach number to activate this damn force :("
theflash,36wsw3,AE71,6,Fri May 22 20:50:23 2015 UTC,"If the jet was flying at Mach 2 down your street and it was the same size as Barry u probably wouldn't see it either. When you're looking at a meteor or jet you're looking at a distance. Perception of speed has to do with viewing angles, distance, and size of the object. If an ant ran at 100mph it would look as if it was running so fast you couldn't see it.  I've seen low level flybys of jets and they haul ass. He's covering a half a mile a second. Up close that's almost too fast to see."
theflash,36wsw3,AverageJay93,1 point,Fri May 22 21:04:53 2015 UTC,Well keep in mind too that they also needed to release a particle traveling the opposite direction for him to crash into in order to make the worm hole. And it had to be in the particle accelerator. So there were more factors at play in this scenario. Maybe future Barry can run Mach 2000 and travel through time on his own unassisted.
theflash,36wsw3,echelon3,2,Fri May 22 20:57:43 2015 UTC,Barry hasn't gone that fast yet though. Maybe when he time traveled I'm eps 15 and probably some random offscreen stuff which is more for fun than anything.   Were seeing the flash at the beginning of getting his powers. I guarantee you well see him go past mach 10 eventually and even into light speed. But it wouldn't be very interesting if they just started him out that powerful right away.

The show was really good up until the finale for me."

theflash,36sce6,Moleculor,5,Thu May 21 21:08:05 2015 UTC,"Nope. Here's the timeline:   The Flash is created by Harrison Wells in 2020 (NOT Eobard Thawne).  This 'Future Flash' is a hero.  Eobard hates him. Who knows why, because Eobard is alive in 21somethingsomething. Supposedly. So I have no idea why Eobard would even care. Eobard learns that Barry Allen is The Flash. Eobard travels back in time to kill Barry Allen. Future Flash somehow knows what Eobard is doing, travels back in time to stop Eobard from killing Barry Allen, and also stops Alternate Barry Allen from saving his mother. Eobard decides instead to kill Barry's mother, putting Barry on the path to become a police forensics specialist (Alternate Barry), which somehow prevents him from becoming The Flash. Eobard loses access to the Speed Force (because Barry becoming The Flash actually gave him access in the first place), stranding him in the past. Eobard crashes Harrison Wells' car, kills him, becomes him, mourns the death of the woman he never met (Wells' wife), proceeds with his plan to create The Flash. In 2015 Eobard activates the accelerator to create The Flash five years early.  Alternate Barry becomes The Flash (not Future Flash, who was also known as The Flash).  Twenty two episodes of The Flash. Last episode of Season 1, Alternate Barry travels back in time to save his mother's life. (Eobard will still be stranded in time, still kill Wells, still work to create The Flash, but Barry's mother will be alive.)  Future Flash tells The Flash not to save his mother. The Flash cries, then comforts his mother as she dies. The Flash travels Back To The Present, punches Eobard in the mouth.  Eddie shoots himself. This should remove Eobard from the timeline, and does.    But here's the problem: This now should revert time back to step 1, where The Flash is created in 2020 by the real Harrison Wells.   Right now? In 2015? The accelerator shouldn't exist. Barry shouldn't be The Flash. No one should be inside the accelerator that shouldn't exist. Barry shouldn't think of Joe as a father. Iris shouldn't be weeping over Eddie.   And here's the big one:  Eddie shouldn't have a reason to shoot himself. Because Eobard doesn't exist any more. So Eddie shouldn't have a bullet in him, but that would mean Eobard would be alive, and would exist, so Eddie would have a reason to shoot himself, but then Eobard won't exist, but then Eddie won't have a reason to shoot himself, etc.  PARADOX. PARADOX. ERROR. UNIVERSE CAN NOT REVERT TO PREVIOUS STATE. REALITY COLLAPSE IMMINENT."

But seriously then: Zoom said that wells created the flash in the future and Barry would not have had his powers for I think it was 10 years after the events int he season 1. Also he is supposed to disappear into the infinity crisis black hole in that future after establishing the JL. Seems like the timeline has been moved up to me and he is going to get sucked into this hole and we can go into a new universe where season 3 of arrow didn't happen! For fucks sake that was awful. Or Ollie and Felicity move to Seattle and open the Sherwood Florist."
theflash,36sdpn,Skoden,1 point,Fri May 22 01:41:27 2015 UTC,"There's also another theory I haven't touched.    If we follow the lore/backstory set they used in Flashpoint, then Thawne was always the one to kill his mom. But, as we know from Flashpoint, reality was split into 3 different streams (that weren't in Flashpoint, only mentioned. As well as a disembodied voice.). After Bat-Thomas kills Thawne here, Barry runs back to stop himself from saving his mom. Making the timeline normal again. In the JL Animated film, post credits show a boom tube open up with parademons.    What I'm getting at is what if the CW Universe is a twist on the events that happened after Flashpoint, in one of the alternate timelines."

theflash,36sdpn,nucklenix,1 point,Fri May 22 02:51:55 2015 UTC,"I always saw the show as ""This is what happens post Flashpoint"" and we still got an ""alternate"" timeline from the original story of the Flash regardless.   Because Eobard went back to kill Barry and Barry knew he had to stop himself from saving his mom, I imagine the entire reasoning behind going ""No"" was that he's already experienced Flashpoint and knows that it's a terrible idea.   I really like what this opens up for the DCU on TV. They basically pulled an Avengers New York event on TV and it's paying off in spades. I'm super giddy about where they might take it."
theflash,36rbdw,rannie_pophe,5,Thu May 21 14:32:28 2015 UTC,That would be awesome. Almost like its own little Multiversity. That way we canalso see Killer Frost without losing the Caitlin from the show.

There are multiple ways this could go,  none of which necessarily indicates bad writing. Although after seeing the decline of quality in the writing in Arrow I don't blame you for being hesitant with this. I'm just curious to see what they do with it.   There is one sloppy thing I will not let slide though. Eddie did not need to die. He could have just sworn to never have sex again and actually followed through knowing it was that or death. Unless he just knew he was too pretty to live like that and this was the easier option."
theflash,36trzo,waitwhatwut,1 point,Fri May 22 02:57:42 2015 UTC,"Yes that makes sense. But a universe with a time paradox physically cannot exist because the timeline rather than continuing foward gets caught in a loop. In this case it's 2 loops at least and I think it's a bit of a stretch. Eddie was pretty stupid though.

I think sci-fi TV has betrayed us enough times that we've come to accept illogical garbage.  If these time paradoxes contradictions are allowed then there is literally nothing that the writer's can't do.  ""Timey-wimey,"" they can say, as we learn that Eobard didn't really disappear, but transported to the past where he found a youthfulness serum that turned him into baby Barry Allen.  Or whatever."
theflash,36trzo,Wraxu,1 point,Wed May 27 16:16:26 2015 UTC,"Speculation-   Eddie created the paradox and the black hole reformed in order to destroy their current universe as a it is no longer functional seeing as how now it's stuck in a loop.  I don't really understand what you mean by testing the future, you can't just test the future without having completed the task to change the future. Also in doing so, Barry would have no memory of saving his mother seeing as how he will not retain the memory of having his mother die and going back to save her. Confusing I know.  One certain fact is that Barry's mom will always need to die, that is how it was meant to happen. The correct timeline is his mother dieing, the alternate timeline is him saving his mother. I believe that future Barry saved his mom and lived the alternate timeline, which had negative repercussions that we don't know about. You may ask, well how did he know he chose the wrong timeline since he wouldn't be able to retain the memory of the correct timeline? Cisco, as we know, has the ability to retain memories from an alternate timeline, maybe he played a part in letting Barry know that saving his mother is/was a mistake.  This doesn't create a loophole, I believe speedsters are unable to create paradoxes from time travel because they use the speed force. (idea from someone else that I think aswell)."

theflash,36ocew,Wraxu,6,Thu May 21 19:34:30 2015 UTC,"I think you're right in that speedsters can avoid creating a paradox because speedforce, but I think when a paradox happens due to time travel, the laws or rules set by that universe are broken and it will attempt to destroy everything in order to fix it. I think that Eddie created a paradox when he killed himself, he stopped Eobard from killing Nora, which would lead to no eobard time travel, which would lead to Eddie not needing to kill himself and the paradox begins. I find it ironic if this were the case, Eddie calls himself a hero for killing himself to stop Eobard, but ends up creating a black hole that's going to destroy everything."
theflash,36ocew,WhatImMike,5,Wed May 20 23:46:40 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, yes. It's ultimately the easiest explanation, a Crisis event would ""reset"" that universe if the events caused too much damage. But, I think it's a little more sinister than that.    We know there was some kind of Crisis event, Flash vanishes and it eventually subsides. This is due in part of the newspaper 'clipping'. Now, the sky's were a dark blue around the wormhole. Instead of the red sky's as told in the original clipping.    With this it's still playing out exactly as it should have. But with subtle differences from Eobard Wells 'forcing' the hand of the natural order of the multiverse.    If that's the case, I can't help but believe Thawne was simply a puppet here. Most likely with the strings being pulled by yet another alternate Thawne. Because he's smart like that.    Or, the blue sky's were from Eddie's talisman :D"

theflash,36ocew,TheSunIsTheLimit,2,Thu May 21 14:33:41 2015 UTC,So the Reverse Flash's speed is dependent on there being another speedster tapping into the speed force? And that is why he lost his speed in the past? Because there were no other speedsters?  Which reverse flash harnesses the speed force through the rings? All I remember is seeing Batman wearing like 3 and thinking he was top shot but still got is ass handed to him by Zoom.
theflash,36ocew,DAVENP0RT,2,Wed May 20 23:22:57 2015 UTC,"None. Thawne originally got his speed from wearing an old suit of Flash's that had residual speed force in it, and later internalized it. Zolomon didn't use the speed force,  he was a time manipulator, that's why he always kicks Wally's ass. I don't remember the incident you described,  but he was probably using stored speed force like early Thawne."
theflash,36ocew,Derianschrodinger,2,Thu May 21 01:03:14 2015 UTC,It was in one of the DC animated movies. One of the Flashes goes missing and the others are seeing weird distortion in space and time. They eventually travel into the future with Batman to find one of the Flashes running on a treadmill to power the speed rings. All the guards were wearing them as well. They get captured and put on the treadmill. Barry runs so fast he teleports the others out of the room then overloads the machine. Batman tries to take Zoom on with multiple rings and gets his ass kicked since he can't use the speed well.
theflash,36ocew,Azuryon,1 point,Thu May 21 02:31:06 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure I've seen this in a cartoon. He's wearing lantern corps rings. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure if that's even true."

theflash,36ocew,jonsoloo,2,Thu May 21 00:44:48 2015 UTC,"We also see Jay Garrick's helmet, and Thawne saying its time to GTFO of there.   This is what I was most curious about, how does Jay Garrick factor into the story? And why does Thawne know that he needs to get out of that timeline?  Or is Jay Garrick's helmet just ""debris"" from the Speedforce and its appearance is just an Easter egg?"
theflash,36ocew,TotesMessenger,5,Thu May 21 11:48:20 2015 UTC,"Jay Garrick is the silver age flash he's also a comic book character to Barry. And who Barry got the name of his persona from. In later issues of Barry as the flash, its found out that Jay Garrick actually did exist. But he along with his allies, and Keystone City were hidden/forgotten from time due to a dimensional rift.  Which later, post Crisis event and everything, DC made it to where Jay was The Flash in another multiverse, instead of just someone forgotten to time.  Jay has fought Thawne side by side with the rest of the Flash family, multiple times. This leads me to believe Thawne knows exactly who he is."

theflash,36ocew,Kinetic_Card,1 point,Thu May 21 19:24:50 2015 UTC,"Interesting thoughts. The concept of the 52 multiverse, instead of the original infinite one, and how to merge these concepts with multiple timelines - when you have people who can see the future and others who can travel back and change things - is something that's been hinted at but never really unequivocally addressed.   If a timeline splits on Earth 2 does that one 'Earth', which is just shorthand for paralell universe, become two and we get 53? Tieing in the concept of 'core events' - sounding a lot like Doctor Who's fixed points in time - is interesting, especially if you mean that Earth 2 as a sphere in the orrery of worlds, and as a 'point' on the map, can contain multiple strands of parallel versions etc.  I think I'd say that, as with lots of stuff like this, to be careful at taking things from multiple sources as related to one another. The Multiverse map is relatively recent and there's still a bunch of contridictions to it that have popped up, as beautiful as it is. Merging this with the continuity of the TV show while great for debate has the issue that the show is under no obligation to adhere to the map or the way the Speedforce, time travel and parrallel worlds are presented within the main DC comics continuity.   Interesting posts though :)"

theflash,36mxmd,AgentChris101,1 point,Wed May 20 22:59:19 2015 UTC,"A possible explanation is that even the Timeline we are following is an alternate timeline as a result of the first time Barry jumped back. Basically the show has presented us with 3 timelines.     Timeline 1:  Barry lives a normal life until one day becoming The Flash by means of an accident. Eddie lives a normal life and is the descendent of Eobard. Eobard uses the speed force to travel through time and eventually comes at odds with Barry. Eobard decides to travel back to when Barry was a child to kill him then. However his presence in this time period immediately creates...     Timeline 2:   Eobard travels back in time but his plan is foiled by White Circle Flash (future Flash) who rescues himself as a child and then (presumably) disappears. Thus, Eobard kills Nora out of frustration. But now for some reason can't time travel anymore. The only explanation for this being that he was only able to tap into the speed force so long as he existed in the same timeline as the White Circle Flash, who was basically the person that opened to door to the SF allowing him to travel in the first place. Now marooned in this new timeline, he sets forth the plans in motion that create Red Circle Flash. Who eventually, in an attempt to save the city from a tidal wave runs so fast he breaks through the time barrier and right into...     Timeline 3:  The timeline in which the season finale takes place.     But do you remember what happened when Red Circle Flash made that jump between timeline 2 and 3? He replaced that timeline's version of himself. For some reason when he jumped back in time, that timeline's Barry ceased to exist and he took his place, complete with all the memories from that other timeline. Basically this was a long winded way of explaining that the Barry and that's in the season finale is from a timeline where Eddie doesn't shoot himself and Eobard is born. Up until the point where Eddie shot himself, the universe was able to cope with everything as a paradox had not yet been created. However, the moment Eddie shot himself and Eobard ceased to exist, the universe became unable to consolidate all the separate timelines and thus, the black hole was created.  Tl/dr: Flash is from a timeline where Eddie didn't shoot himself"

theflash,36mxmd,Mapcycler,1 point,Thu May 21 10:46:48 2015 UTC,"That's what you're not getting. White circle Flash is from Timeline 1 where Eddie doesn't shoot himself. So his role remains unchanged.

theflash,36mxmd,Mapcycler,1 point,Thu May 21 11:08:30 2015 UTC,Because he's cut off from the speed force and is therefore no longer protected by the same principles that allowed Barry to replace himself when he went back the first time.

If this was the case then why did his full grown version know that current Barry would travel back in time in attempt to save his mother.

theflash,36n9lz,GuitarCFD,13,Wed May 20 17:01:41 2015 UTC,"I brought this up in a post I made last night, but it was down voted to oblivion because of the rush everyone had.    Here's my take on all of this, if you know about Flash lore, you know that Thawne is pretty much a paradoxal entity now. For the longest time he has gone back and forth through time altering his own person. Making himself stronger, changing certain aspects of his own life. But first and foremost he makes sure he survives.    With that being said, I believe the Thawne we saw phase out of existence was nothing more than a puppet. One in which the real thawne exploited.    Time travel is weird with DC. Alternate timelines become alternate universes, meaning the universe that is created can be deleted if its divergence is altered. But, it's not the same parallel universes like how they have the Multiverse. Think of every multiverse as its own spot in a pond, and you throw two pebbles, both of those pebbles make a ripple and sometimes they overlap. The ripples are the time traveling alternate realities and the first splash is that multiverse. Understood?    Now let's get a couple more things out of the way. There will always be a Flash, and there will always be Reverse Flash. These two are multiverse constants. DC has established the multiverse ""architecture"" so that no matter what happens, there are constant events. The destruction of Krypton. A(the) Wayne(s) dying. The discovery of Atlantis and the Amazons. Darkseid. Captain/Citizen Cold. The Canary. Hawkman/girl. The powers of Shazzam. The Lantern Corp(s). Barry's mother being murdered. Barry being struck by lightning in some capacity.   Had Barry actually saved his mom, that entire timeline would have been removed. Including that Thawne going home because he is now part of that timeline, he exists in that time. So removing the event that put him there, would negate him being able to leave.    You also have to look at how alerted Thawne was when Cisco told him of yet another divergence. Thawne didn't calculate that. So now, yet again there is another timeline where Cisco is dead and Eobard is still alive. Before Eddie had the chance to kill himself. Before deleting Eobard from history.   The actions in this episode implied everything after Cisco's death is already in a 4th time stream deviation. Older Barry telling Barry no implies he knew he was there, no matter what he knew he was there. He stopped and looked directly at him. We can assume this may all be taking place Post-Flashpoint and possibly Post-Crisis. Everything after his mothers death, and up until Cisco's death is one section of a different timeline. One in which Cisco/Vibe can tap into.    This brings me to Eddies assume death. They told us he is in fact a great great great grandfather. This also implies that he is this universes version of Malcolm Thawne. And its been noted he's wearing a weird charm around his neck. My theory here leads back to coincidence as they said, there is no science to coincidence. The coincidence is, that as soon as Eddie died a ""wormhole"" formed. A blue one. Whether or not that's important is yet to be seen. But for the sake of my theory and loose flash lore, as well as assumptions, let's say that Eddies death and the wormhole were a coincidence in that he got sucked into it, with his charm being visible, as he presumably died.    In the comics Malcolm Thawne, an adopted Thawne, born an Allen. Is bestowed  a gift from his adoptive grandmother, that allows him to utilize the blue flame power of the Thawne family to heal himself and give himself powers.    It's also known that this power is fueled by his hatred for The Flash, his brother. Which, he absolutely does hate Barry, he's going to be even more pissed when he finds out that in every timeline but the one he's in Barry marries Iris. Which he might be able to see in said wormhole after his amulet brings him back to life. What would also be pretty sweet, is while in the wormhole he finds out the truth about his life, and his jealousy of The Flash will grow even stronger because its a life he could have lived. Loosely based on the back story Malcolm has in the comics.    Now, as I wrap this up we now know this is yet another alternate. You need to remember going into next season that Thawne was visibly shaken at not only Cisco's revelation. But Jay Garrick's helmet. He knew for certain it was time to GTFO of there.   I hope this made sense to those of you reading, and explains some possible outcomes for what's in store for season 2.    TL;DR nothings ever as it seems, paradoxes, multiple timelines in different universes, confirmed TV versions of comic characters, speed force."

theflash,36n9lz,Azuryon,3,Thu May 21 05:43:24 2015 UTC,"Don't think of time as linear.  Eobard was already back in our present time, Eddie killing himself shouldn't have changed that.  It would just mean that since Eobard's ancestor died his past/present never would have occurred.  Eobard was already outside that loop so basically he should have just remained where he was locked outside of his own reality.  Really from the first time Eobard went back and killed Barry's mother he should have been locked out of his own reality.  He changed the past.  Remember he tried to go right back to his present but he was out of power.  If he had left right then and didn't manipulate events to recreate the Flash etc Iris would have ended up with Eddie.

This is very different from how Daisy Johnson's Quake powers are manifesting in Agents of SHIELD. Even tho in the comic book universe both of their power sets seemed at least on the surface to be very similar. Both Vibe (DC) and Quake (Marvel) are lesser known characters in their respective comic book publication companies, who are promising to be significant supporting characters in their respective TV incarnations.

In the finale Eobard isnt a paradox, and thus the timeline tries to repair itself but it never can so it collapses in on itself."

theflash,36n9lz,TheGillos,2,Wed May 20 19:10:16 2015 UTC,"True. But then you have to take into consideration that for each multiverse there is also an infinite number of alternate timelines for that multiverse. Based on the 52 constant multiple universes, each with their own unique constant variables.    Outside of the multiverse in the other hand, is the speed force wall. The outer protective layer that separates the multiverse from the sphere of the Gods."

And that black hole is there to clean up the past.  also by tapping into the speedforce The Flash doesnt follow the same rules of time and space. He is effectively ""removed"" and cannot create a paradox  I am so glad TV watchers now get to have this conversation in the DC context. Man this crap happens ALL the time in the comics ;p"

I'm sure I'm wrong on several points. Feel free to enlighten me.   When Eddie killed himself, this caused that Eobard Thawne to cease to exist. Since this Eddie never conceived a child in this timeline, Eobard was never born in this timeline, and therefore was never able to meet Flash, grow to hate him, go back in time to kill him, kill his mom instead, get stuck in the past and have to befriend his enemy and meet these other people in this timeline. What Barry Allen did by not saving his mother thwarted Eobard's attempts to go to his future, but otherwise left that timeline intact. What Eddie did was wipe away everything Eobard Thawne ever did.   But here's the paradox. By killing himself, Eddie also wiped from time a reason to kill himself. If his descendant Eobard never did all these things, Eddie didn't have a reason to kill himself.   When Barry comes back down from that wormhole, he may not recognize the Central City he falls back down into. It may even be a Central City that has another him in it. In this reality, his mother was never killed by Eobard Thawne so his father never went to jail. No one caused Dr Harrison Wells and his wife to die that night so he'd be moving forward with his plans to build a particle accelerator in the 2020s. So in 2015 it may only be under construction. Without Thawne discovering Ronnie, Cisco, and Caitlin it's plausible all three of them would have dramatically different lives. Without Thawne/Wells support, they may not have realized their potential, and are just troubled young people without guidance. Perhaps in this incarnation Professor Martin Stein and Dr. Tina McGee are working alongside Dr. Harrison Wells, who in this incarnation was himself and so he didn't spurn associates or alienate friends. So he had no reason to seek out Caitlin or Cisco or Ronnie. In this timeline, since Wells/Thawne didn't make a point to befriend Cisco or Caitlin, I'd say they are at odds with the particle accelerator, perhaps as activists criticising the construction of a device like this so close to a populated area. Iris and Ronnie may be there too. If these characters weren't friends before in this timeline this is where they'd meet.   So when Barry Allen tries to pick up his life where he left off, he'd find himself in an environment very alien to where he left. Familiar and yet not. Also, Eobard Thawne was still trying to go back in time to take advantage of the knowledge of Barry Allen's name, but this go around he can't go back in time any further than the point where the previous him ""died."" So he shows up now after Barry closes the wormhole. This is an Eobard Thawne who never became Harrison Wells. He never got to kill the people he killed in the first season so they're all there.   There are so many ways this could go. Season two looks very promising."
