GamerPals,3e36ab,IceyFlamez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it is. The slogan is ""stop playing with yourself"" but I didn't know what to put for the title haha :p"
GamerPals,3e36ab,IceyFlamez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:48 2015 UTC,"Oh true, that would look a little suggestive in the title lol. Especially because it'd sound like a slogan for a hookup site."

GamerPals,3e36ab,Aulton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:36:49 2015 UTC,"What sets the website apart from the multitude of others like this? I've seen many different ones all go under, or just not pick up at all."
GamerPals,3e36ab,DaReaper95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:20 2015 UTC,"I definitely think a small amount of advertising would help you bring in just enough revenue to make this endeavor easier to sustain, and if you kept it gamer oriented, and avoided anything intrusive or lag inducing, you'd actually improve the experience rather than hinder it. Even Newgrounds (Everything by Everyone is their motto, and they are so focused on the user experience that it's astounding) uses advertisements to keep the site afloat.   All in all, it is obviously your call, but I think it would do more harm than good to potentially link users to new games or merchandise they would not otherwise find."
GamerPals,3e36ab,DaReaper95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for such a positive outlook on advertisements. Many people see adverts as a quick way to make money or to show that the developers don't really care for their content - but I see it as a way to keep the content there in the first place.  I'll admit, the server fees aren't too expensive for me right now but I don't know how well my financial situation will end up being in a month's, or even a year's time. Advertisements have been considered for a long time, but I think that the best way to implement advertisements would be once we already have the solid userbase who understand why we would need to use advertisements and not just see it as an easy profit. The user base would be the 'backup,' helping new users to understand why we needed to use adverts and hopefully not putting them off using the service. The main reason I haven't used any form of advertising right now is because my main goal is to connect gamers and I don't really want to slow down the process with adverts or anything else.  One decision that I have made, however, and will stand by, is that the users will never be charged for the service - no matter how much of an issue the financial aspect of the site becomes. The revenue will come from either advertising from sources such as Google, or adverts directly from third-party companies who want us to promote their product, preferably a game, as a background on the website, etc. It seems a weird concept to me that, after seeing some of the other websites out there, users are - in essence - expected to pay money to 'make friends'."
GamerPals,3e36ab,Devourinq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:05:20 2015 UTC,"You can also take donations for things like badges and icons, things that don't really give anyone an ""edge"" over anyone else like priority in searches or anything like that, but just kinda look cool if they use the site a lot."
GamerPals,3e36ab,TimbreWolves,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:08:49 2015 UTC,"That's very true, it's definitely something I'll need to look in to having :)"
GamerPals,3e36ab,DustyRug,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:30:34 2015 UTC,"That's definitely the hardest part about it. It's easy to say that the site will do well, if it already has the community structure to help it grow further. A site with 100,000 members can grow a lot quicker than one with 50 or so.  I can't compare my site to others because I haven't really used many others to reference from. The inspiration came from my (initial) understanding that this was a unique idea that hadn't been done before. I hadn't researched much in to the project but thought it would be interesting as a sort of gamer hub for people who want to find and form teams for games.  I guess what sets us out most is the passion behind it. Rather than just being another site there to make a profit or with a community that doesn't really care, my main goal is to pursue the objective of the site: to help gamers find gamers. I want to make it as easy as possible and always include the community in anything that happens.  Whether or not the site will take off or not, I really can't say. But I hope that the dedication and support from both the members and myself will eventually pay off and help gamers from around the world to connect."
GamerPals,3e36ab,DustyRug,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:00:31 2015 UTC,"May I suggest you make it easier to add games to your profile. Instead of it redirecting you to some other page where you need to fill out information, it could perhaps just be something you check off. It is much less of a hassle this way.   Also, when updating profile info on your dashboard, it'd be nice to be redirected back to the dashboard once we pressed the update details button. Just so it is more convenient for the user."
GamerPals,3e36ab,Gynwaith,2,Tue Jul 21 21:17:31 2015 UTC,"That's definitely something I'm looking to working on, I just need to figure out the best way to do it (since some users use different consoles, etc). I think I have a solution but it'll take a bit of time to work around it.  And yeah, the dashboard is a bit messy that's also something I need to fix. Thanks for the feedback though it's really appreciated."
GamerPals,3e36ab,Gynwaith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:50:11 2015 UTC,"One more thing to look into would be to make it easy for either a user to add a game to the list if it isn't already there, or submit the game somehow to be added by one of you who runs the site. Chivalry, for instance, was not on the list of games."
GamerPals,3e36ab,Gynwaith,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:42:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's something I was considering how to do. It's extremely easy for site administrators to add games, but not so much for users to be able to suggest them. I'm thinking perhaps having a link on the bottom of the site saying 'Suggest a Game' or elsewhere on the site?  Let me know where you think it would suit best. :)"

GamerPals,3dv87t,Takeshira,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:55:42 2015 UTC,"Team Fortress 2 is a team-oriented FPS game, with hats.   Dota2 is a Real-Time Strategy game where you play with a team of other people against another team. You control a character from a top-down viewpoint and move across the gamefield, using skills and auto-attacks when ever you come across an enemy until you reach the opposing team's side, at which point you try to attack a structure in their base which, upon destruction, leads to your victory. If you've heard or seen of League of Legends it's basically the same idea (though I'm going to get a lot of flack for saying that)."

Of course hoping is all I did until I opened it and saw this filth that had spread onto your post. Since no one else seems to be taking this subreddit seriously, I'll do the honors.  22/M/EST steam name is XxTimbreWolvesxX * Chivalry * Depth * Gmod * War Thunder * Speedrunners * Skyforge (newly open beta) * HotS (rarely play it anymore, because of lack of friends to play with but battle.net is TimbreWolves #1873) * Terraria (preferably newbies and not hardcore experts) * Just recently started my first ever playing of WoW  These are my main games that I'm up for playing almost anytime, other than that I'd say check my Steam profile for whatever I didn't list.  I prefer to use Curse Voice for chat, but I also have TS3, Mumble, and Vent. I pretty much refuse to use skype as it's the crappiest ui I've ever seen. I prefer you to be 18+ just for maturity reasons. (I've played enough CoD with 9 year olds who've had sex with my mom to last a lifetime) and gender is of no concern to me, nor is your sexual preference. That's your business and I couldn't care less who you like as long as you're here for friendship and games.

Not that I'm really looking for people to play any specific games with but instead I enjoy getting to know people with similar interests.  18/M/EST I haven't really been playing much other than CS:GO recently. Used to play a lot of Guild Wars 2, League of Legends, Payday 2, Runescape, and Minecraft on PC. I also got a PS4 in late spring of this year, and played quite a bit of Bloodborne, GTA5 and Destiny on it. I also have LittleBigPlanet 3, Assassin's Creed: Unity, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare (although I try to avoid playing it) and a couple of the free PS+ games from the past couple months.   Aside from that, I have a decently sized steam library, Steam name is: ""AHollowHeart"" and I've been trying to get into YouTube lately, so if you wanna check that out, my channel is also ""AHollowHeart"", I only have one video at the moment, but I'd love to meet some people that mesh well with me to help out.  I mainly use Skype. It's always worked and personally, I think it's the easiest thing to set up and use.  Do with that as you will.  Edit: People Preferences: 18+ is what i'm going for. That's for maturity's sake. There are exceptions, but overall, I just look for good people that know how to have fun when it's appropriate, and know how to chill when needed. Also, I'm not really touchy on any subjects whatsoever. I've lived on the internet long enough to not get offended by pretty much anything, and to make jokes about pretty much everything.

GamerPals,3drf62,7thpound,9,Sat Jul 18 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"I've moderated the sub for one and a half year now and went through a few iterations of the rules but also had to keep them lax for various reasons.   If we forbid common games like league, CS:GO, rocket league(or whatever other game recently gains a lot of hype), dota, world of warcraft and so forth we lose pretty much all our traffic and gain none. While subreddits exist for the express purpose of finding others to play with these don't always result in successes. You can't blame people for widening their search area. I'm well aware of certain men who are only after female contact. Obviously their posts are removed but it is mission impossible to moderate all the replies with the moderator staff we have(nor can we justify getting a sizable moderator increase for the size our humble subreddit has) and we definitely can't do anything about people contacting one another through private messaging. Our subreddit is relatively small. 5k was a great number to hit but realistically the majority of those people are a combination of inactive subscribers and/or people who play the mainstream games. When someone looks for people to play old or less-familiar games they shouldn't expect to find those people here, that shouldn't stop them from trying of course but they shouldn't expect it.   In the end I welcome any kind of activity. The league player of today could be looking for a different game tomorrow. I'm not going to ban the largest amount of traffic and kill off the subreddit."
GamerPals,3drf62,Sandbucketman,3,Sat Jul 18 20:41:36 2015 UTC,"I'd be open to helping mod the subreddit if that's a possibility. As i said in my reply to this post, I have it bookmarked and check it way more than i should, I usually keep it open in a tab and just refresh it every 30 mins to an hour to see what new posts there are. I hate seeing the 'guy looking for girls' posts, and have reported a few posts for it as well, with the worst being a guy and his girlfriend looking for another girl to game with and have 'other' activites in their area. (I assume I don't need to elaborate on the meaning of 'other').  But please, if there's a possibility that I could help keep this subreddit clean for myself and the other people looking for GamerPals, I'd be happy to oblige."
GamerPals,3drf62,TimbreWolves,2,Sat Jul 18 22:02:17 2015 UTC,"In regards to #3, does this mean that it's frowned upon, or even against the rules, to have more interest in finding friends of a specific gender?  I understand that this subreddit could run the risk of becoming a kind of ""dating sub"" in some people's eyes, but there are other, legitimate reasons for having a bias for a certain gender."
GamerPals,3drf62,Bruhmis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:46:25 2015 UTC,"Any posts aimed at finding the opposite gender, regardless of intentions will be removed. I will take note of your confusion and edit the rules to better reflect our opinion on that.  This is primarily because even though we agree there could be very legitimate reasons for finding people of the other gender the primary one is dating related, or at least men having a larger interest in women. If we cut corners about the rules people will try to read in between the lines and we have to start up arguments about who is and who isn't allowed to post about x subject."
GamerPals,3drf62,Sandbucketman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:50:08 2015 UTC,"but I was more referring to people who just visibly have an open gender bias. you mentioned the difficulty of moderating PMs, so the way I understood was that if someone replies more to people of the opposite sex then they're breaking the rules."
GamerPals,3drf62,Bruhmis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:52:09 2015 UTC,"I cannot moderate PM's, they are outside of a subreddit's domain so if someone decides to private message women or men solely for dating purposes I cannot do anything about this, even if it breaks the rules of our subreddit."

Sure after all these posts I roll my eyes after the x thousandth post about someone looking for league of legends pals to play with. But the fact there's so many means that there's an actual prospect for these people to find others to play with here and at the same time someone who plays one game can still plays tons of other games, so it's not as if this traffic is entirely bad for fans of other games either.  Ideally our sub would be massive, we'd have megathreads all over and hundreds of replies where people meet up online daily to find the best friend they hadn't met before.

GamerPals,3drf62,jesspls,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:39:10 2015 UTC,"It seems that the point now, as it looks like the core users (if I may call us that) are in agreement, is to figure out what to do about the issue. While I understand the concern about losing traffic over removing the undesirables (if I may call them that), it has to be weighed against the potential damage that said undesirables do, or have the potential to do, to the thread. This can be culminated in the question, ""How many core redditors do we keep, and how many are not joining, by allowing these undesirable redditors (and/or their posts) to remain?"" The best thing I can come up with is to redirect undesirables, not just block them. That way we keep the subthread clean of unrelated posts, while keeping more of the traffic than we would have otherwise. But I'm simply applying what I'm learning in my marketing/finance classes to this, as I have only been a redditor for a very short while. So please, what do you all think?  Edit: I assume the core users are in agreement. It isn't too difficult to assume that the people who actually want to make friends and play games together may be getting tired of having to dig through post after post for what they're looking for."

I run as an Assault with all of the medic oriented perks, or Recon with an ACW-R for spawn beacons and infiltration on Rush maps. I play a lot of MMOs, I can run any role. Typically I'm a Tank and have played a healer in raid settings, but I'm open to DPSing if I can get a good group together. Typically I'm a tank for fast que times and to fill an important role that others seem to avoid. I have Mumble, Vent, TS3, Skype...and I can coordinate teams if needed.

It's getting to the point where I'm considering not telling people if I enjoyed something until I've caught up a little xD"

Great site if you didn't know about it to keep track of everything you've watched and want to see etc. My 'watching' and 'want to watch' lists on there are ridic... I keep picking too many shows up at once and then getting overloaded and I stop them all and pick them up again months later lmao"

I tend to get demoralised if I see it too much, so I only add stuff I'm watching/have finished, and then other stuff I just have as a notepad xD  Fortunately I know that if I settle down to it I can finish a 13 episode season easily in 4 hours if I enjoy it, a 24 episode season on a weekend. Just gotta get in that mindset more often."

GamerPals,3b8brb,SteamLinkage,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:32:27 2015 UTC,Short answer is a younger me was really bad at turning stuff off. A lot of my hours aren't very accurate because I would do something like play an hour but have it running alt tabbed for a day.  For Bioshock Infinite specifically I actually did play it through twice and I can't quite answer why. I enjoyed the story and it was a good experience and for some reason I just wanted to play it again when I was done. I can't say I'd do the same now if it released tomorrow. I don't think I  had all that much else on the time either so maybe that had something to do with it.

You can probably buy a half-decent microphone off Amazon for £5-8, which is probably equal, roughly, to the price of some frozen french fries at your local supermarket.

GamerPals,3atzbf,IUnicornMasterI,2,Tue Jun 23 14:25:53 2015 UTC,"Few questions:-   What other games have games have open-ended goals for users to set? This works with sandbox games quite well, but only really sandbox games. Where would you be able to rent a server for just a few hours at a relatively cheap price? DigitalOcean's could probably host it for you for ~$0.0595 for that five hour session, Linode for ~$0.30 (I'd like to point out I'm guessing at MC's server specs as I've never hosted one, but I assume 20 active players would require ~4GB of RAM and ~2 cores (of unknown speed, since nether service seem to provide their core speed). How would you deal with latency for multiple players? Servers would be hosted where? New York for equalish distance to the west coast and Europe?   I'd be up for it, but I'd want to know a little more about how you actually plan on hosting this, and who's going to be managing the server, because obviously if the server drops at 8PM unexpectedly, I'd want someone who knows what they're doing to get it up A.S.A.P or interest would drop."
GamerPals,3atzbf,SteamLinkage,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:41:12 2015 UTC,"This is a difficult one, which is why I picked Minecraft first. There is so many different events or goals that could be set, especially with the addition of mods. However nothing is set in stone with this idea. The next week I might run a GTA 5 event for a smaller group, or the week after that an even bigger event on a popular F2P game. Minecraft really is the perfect choice for this kind of a thing so it might stick, or it might change. We shall have to see. Server rental shouldn't be an issue. If I get enough interest I may just rent dedi from somewhere for a month and run a few Minecraft events on it. Right now I am thinking of running the server from Europe. I won't make this a EU only event, but due to timezones and latency, trying to find the right balance for both EU and US might end up just making it laggy and awkward for both."

I've also got a lot of other games on Steam, but I mostly play Marvel Heroes, Warframe and Heroes of the Storm at the moment. I usually play pretty late though and I am CST. Let me know if your down."

GamerPals,3ap101,PirateXGamer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:42:42 2015 UTC,"I play a bit more than casually, but it's mostly just doing weeklies/dailies and making new outfits out of cartel pack gear.  If you haven't already used a referral link and you're a sub I'm pretty sure you get a free transfer. If not, they're discounted down to 90CC atm."

Not sure how the timings would work out, I'm mainly online anytime from about 7pm onwards, but have gf and her three kids that need looking after as well, so could be some evenings when I'm back and forth, etc.  Also up for GMod and alike.  Can't access Steam (or most gaming sites) from work, but feel free to add me on there: stolen_art"

How does it work in multiplayer? Are quests etc shared? I assume hardcore mode will be off too? (or this will be a short-lived world)"
GamerPals,3ap63s,Sp33dy89,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:20:35 2015 UTC,In AGS1 the quests/rewards were shared. everyone got the reward if quest complete. That's if everyone grouped up
GamerPals,3ap63s,wacha180,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:28:57 2015 UTC,I have no idea how these modpack things work but Im willin to give it a shot. I haven't played pc minecraft in about 2 yrs. Lemme know if interested.
GamerPals,3ap63s,scates09,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:04:21 2015 UTC,Hey 24/M/US here. I started agrarian skies 2 a couple months ago. It was pretty fun but got boring in a single player world. I imagine it would be great with other people helping out and playing. I just added you on steam so I'm looking forward to it
GamerPals,3ap63s,Kyomae,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:42:41 2015 UTC,"20/M/US  This definitely sound like a lot of fun! I just added you on Steam. I also have TeamSpeak. Haven't tried Agragarian Skies 2, yet, but I'm very interested in meeting new players for Minecraft!"
