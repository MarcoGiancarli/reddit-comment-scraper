I want to try something new, something with more creativity.  I dunno, maybe something automotive. I'd love to get into the outdoor gear industry, but there isn't much in the way of engineering opportunities in my area.  Also been thinking about doing my own thing, although that's more of a long shot, and incredibly harder to do when unemployed.  Sorry for the rant, it's just been on my mind a lot.

It's all linear algebra and tricks to determine the performance of complicated circuits. It's cool stuff, like, for instance, you basically learn how to write a circuit solving program using matrix algebra for any n devices, and you learn a bunch of different ways to calculate output sensitivity with respect to variations of individual parts values in your circuit. It's a ton of math though and the processes are complicated as hell.  What are you looking at getting into?

TheVeneration,3d8jym,wz_,2,Tue Jul 14 10:02:24 2015 UTC,"There was a thread in askreddit last week on perfect albums. Since then I've been listening to Kind of Blue by Miles Davis. He's the cliche answer for jazz but goddamn he's good.   I've also been listening to ""Stop the world I wanna get off with you"" by the Arctic Monkeys and the album Turn Blue by the Black Keys.   Turn blue is very different from everything they did previously. I'm a massive fan of the Black Keys style of muddy, fuzzy bare bones blues rock like on Brothers. It took me a few listens to really get a feel for this album, but once I caught the bug I haven't really been able to put it down. ""In our prime"" might be my current favorite song. I'll be honest, I had to listen to this album stoned a few times to really let it sink in. I bring this up not to brag about smoking but to give you the full picture of my experience with the album - sitting in a camping chair on my apartment roof, looking out over the city, alone with the night sky above me, slightly stoned but still very much functional. It was like digesting this new album, getting a feel for what Dan and Patrick wanted to put out. It's very much a black keys album while at the same time being completely new in sound and taste and texture.   And in another genre, Dark Sky Paradise is awesome. I've always liked Big Sean and this album is nonstop good fun. Every single song is catchy and there's not ten seconds of filler. I don't remember the last time I was able to say that for a mainstream rap album."

I haven't gotten out of the gym as much as I'd like this year, though, since my usual climbing buddies are in Europe for the summer.  I used to bike cross-country semi-competitively in my teens, and basically stopped altogether after my first year of University. I've been getting back into it this year, but it feels weird riding on what was once a high-end bike when it's the only 26"" wheeled hardtail out on the trail. Everyone's gone either 29"" or 27.5"".  As for the hiking, I'm slowly ramping up the intensity (and starting to carry a weighted backpack) in anticipation of my Rim-to-Rim Grand Canyon trip this coming October. Next year, I'm thinking of doing the JMT, and I'd like to do the PCT within the next five years."

TheVeneration,3buvhh,CitizenWilderness,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:21:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm really liking it too, super impressed by how snappy the camera is, and how you can shoot raw.   I'm not a big fan of all the LG interface things though, I used to be a Nexus user, and I really love stock Android."
TheVeneration,3buvhh,onealjp,2,Tue Jul 7 08:48:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really like the camera as well. It's a massive upgrade from my old S3.  I'm actually a fan of the LG interface. I really did not like the TouchWiz from the Galaxy (it is actually what prevented me from getting a Galaxy S6, I wanted to try something different). I haven't had any issues with the LG interface quite yet. It's a little gimmicky and cutesy with the icons and such but I've liked what I've seen so far."
TheVeneration,3buvhh,CitizenWilderness,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:32:51 2015 UTC,"That's funny, I was also considering going with the S6, but TouchWiz and all the Samsung default apps was a big turn off for me too.   The LG system isn't that bad, but I still disabled most of the branded apps and quirks. I guess I just get anal about the things that I like and the things I don't.

TheVeneration,3boc3p,c-a-hartattack,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:39:19 2015 UTC,A lot of raw denim(and other higher end denim) sellers carry really lightweight raws/denim. 12oz denim and less. Great for hot summers.

TheVeneration,3boc3p,maverickmonk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:16:07 2015 UTC,"A lot of lightweight denims are going to be stretch fit. Spandex and similar materials are stronger for their weight than cotton, so when reducing the weight that much, the denim would be too weak without replacing some of the cotton with a stretchier material so you don't tear through the thinner fabric.  EDIT: Really, the stretch is negligible. It's really only there for the fabric's durability. Not like a jegging or a ""girlie jean""."
TheVeneration,3boc3p,TempestStorm,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:17:50 2015 UTC,"Check out Denimio. Currently the Japanese yen is terribly low, you can pick up a pair of Japan Blues for around 107.

TheVeneration,3b6ec3,is-this-desire,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:03:19 2015 UTC,"Yup! I got TOBS Sandalwood, and two from Mama Bear's. One is ""Wood"" and the other is ""Vetivert,"" which is their knockoff of Guerlain Vetiver, supposedly. I honestly can't smell them right now, but as soon as I get my nose back I'll report."

A guy's gonna come check it out on Monday, driving quite a ways so he'll probably end up picking it up.   I'm really torn. I don't really need to sell it, and I really don't want to, I'm just having a hard time justifying keeping it. I never get to ride it. If I'm not at work I've got my 5 yr old son with me, and as much as I work I'm not going to drop him off at daycare to go ride.   I did all the work to it myself and had future plans for it, so I'm pretty attached to it. I had actually sold it at one point and bought it back (for less than I sold it for, no less!)  I just need to pay off my credit card. Plus we're planning on moving later this year and there's a lot up in the air as to where we're going to be when we do pull the trigger, and if I'll have a place to store it. Plus all the costs of moving.   I'unno, I just need to win he lottery or something."

It cost me ~$22 which works out to a little over $3.00 per meal.

I'm trying to decide if I want a sissy bar or not. Maybe one I can bolt on/off when I feel like it or travel"
TheVeneration,3b22rx,FalconPaunch,2,Fri Jun 26 04:16:08 2015 UTC,"Got another day at work going on here. My team leader dipped out of work again without an excuse. Apparently was out partying and posting stuff on Facebook at like 3 am. He does good work when he shows up, as infrequent as that is. Really gets frustrating sometimes. Like, we're pretty lax in my shop, I've been late on a multitude of occasions. But I still show up. I don't know, I just wish more people got the idea of work. Like yeah, it can suck, but its kinda necessary and part of our world."
TheVeneration,3b22rx,CitizenWilderness,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:18:17 2015 UTC,"That sounds annoying, and the drunk Facebook pics makes it even worse. How did your boss react? Also, may I ask in what kind of shop do your work?"
TheVeneration,3b22rx,FalconPaunch,3,Thu Jun 25 23:15:26 2015 UTC,"The bosses really don't react to it. He's been there 3 years, hasn't mattered yet. I've only been there 1 year, nearly 1.5. My dad is a pretty high position in the corporation. So he got me the job. And though I used to have issues with tardiness, that's why I bust my ass harder than ever.   We make racks that hold plastic car parts for chrome plating. We make it for the other branch location of the company that actually does the plating. Pretty cool stuff admittedly."

TheVeneration,3aygz3,Elwood521,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:49:33 2015 UTC,"I went bouldering in the forest of Fontainebleau a couple weeks ago. The place was amazing. It's about an hour train ride south of Paris, it's a huge forest that used to be a sea bed or something, so the soil is mostly sand and there are those huge boulders everywhere. Apparently people have been climbing there for more than a century.   It was my first time climbing outside of a gym, not gonna lie I was scared shitless most of the time. But I did finish a bunch of routes so I guess it wasn't that bad.  Bunch of pics."
TheVeneration,3aygz3,CitizenWilderness,2,Wed Jun 24 21:18:52 2015 UTC,"Dude that's awesome!  Yeah it's pretty nerve-wracking outdoors at first. I got so used to the pads of the gym, I was terrified the first time I fell on crash pads.  Is the climbing in Fontainebleau easily accessible? I might actually be taking a trip to Paris, and would love to check it out.  Also, the flickr link gives me an error, ""404 Page not Found""."
TheVeneration,3aygz3,CitizenWilderness,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:43:15 2015 UTC,"I know right! I was surprised at how much cushion the crash pads provide though.  Yes it's quite accessible, they had trains going there from one of Paris' main train stations about every 40 minutes (on a Sunday). The train ride is about 50 minutes to an hour and then you have to walk for about 15 to 20 minutes (through the forest so it's still quite nice).  The place if huge though, so If you have a car it's even easier and you can actually go to more remote/interesting places.    There are a lot of information on that website.   Hit me up if you ever come to Paris and need a place to crash or someone to show you around.  I fixed the Flickr link too."

So I'm sitting through 4 1-hour lectures a week, and teaching 3 1.5-hour discussion sections.   I'm also trying to train for a century bicycle ride (100 miles), which is difficult to fit in. Yesterday I got up at 5 to fit a 40-mile ride in before classes. I TA'd for 5 hours, biked 10 miles home, and slept for 12 hours.   I'm sorry i haven't been as active in this sub as I used to. I've been bicycling into work more, which means my fits are extremely generic (same pair of jeans + chippewas I keep at work, plus whatever tee I grab in the morning). While I don't ride motorcycles, the aesthetic we share a common intrest in is pretty rad.   In the spirit of Out in the Wild Wednesdays, I'm taking my girlfriend for her first car-camping trip Friday and Saturday to a nice spot an hour or two away.

TheVeneration,3av038,deadstick_it,3,Wed Jun 24 00:00:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had no idea how much we would raise. There is a minimum order of 35 shirts, and I am figuring they'll probably average around $10 a shirt--we are so close!  donations of $20 or more will get a free shirt shipped to them. I figure we'll try and sell the extras for around $15 which will leave $5 profit off of each shirt, 100% of the profits will go right back into the site one way or another. I figure we should run this subreddit no differently than a motorcycle club, All profits are The Veneration's money and we will vote on what to do with it."

I had the leather jacket first and after I low-sided I opted to get the armored jacket. I used to mostly wear the armored one after the crash for safety and piece of mind.

I'm not saying you can watch one video and be a pro but it helps get the ball rolling. I personally watch all kinds of builds on youtube and I'll go watch welding and custom fabrication vids just to watch how they manipulate simple tools like angle grinders and hand tools to get a job done.  If you're right out of the gate I'd suggest a few tools that I wish I would have bought early on. Especially working on old Jap import bikes.   A magnetic Parts tray. You can get them for $5 and they will save your bacon. Aside from safety, Organization is the next most important thing when wrenching on old bikes. Impact Wrench. So crucial for those shitty old No.2 Phillips head bolts. A good set of screwdrivers, wrenches and sockets. Or at the very least, ones with an unlimited warranty. Cause if they won't last, might as well have them replaced on someone else's wallet. Also have more than one 6"" No.2 Phillips and a few different length No.2 Phillips screw drivers. A multi-meter. These are key for diagnosing electrical problems which you will inevitably run into with older bikes. And plus it's the one tool that makes you look like you somewhat know what you're doing ;)  Angle grinder but furthermore an assortment of flap disks and wire cup brushes. These are so nice for surface prep and paint stripping. Simple one, but keep your household containers. I can't tell you how many times an empty orange juice container has helped drain oil, bleed brakes, funnel etc...   Edit: Formatting."

However it was because I donated it to my best friends sister who was running a marathon for a cancer charity because their mum is currently undergoing chemotherapy (she is half way through) so I think I can wait...

TheVeneration,3ale2g,Regalzack,3,Mon Jun 22 01:18:39 2015 UTC,"So I'm at this crossroads. I've been lifting for years, but I really only started monitoring calories and following a good program about 2 months ago. I've been putting on an impressive amount of muscle and a noticeable amount of fat. The gains keep coming but--I'm probably around 20%(according to my bf caliper--although I look like more around 16%) I am really anxious and excited to cut down to 10% bf, but I don't want to postpone the incredible gains I'm tapping into.   My tentative plan is to eat to maintenance(3000 Cal) on lift days and at a 500 deficit on non lift days.  I'm torn...."
TheVeneration,3ale2g,working_on_it,2,Sun Jun 21 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"I assume you want to cut for summer? Because otherwise, why not just keep bulking? You've got another 5%-10% bf before you'd need to cut."
TheVeneration,3ale2g,heidevolk,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:31:29 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you can cut fat and gain muscle at the same time with proper dieting? My understanding is that if most of or a good chunk of your calories come from protein, you can keep building muscle. I've heard that if your protein intake # in grams matches your weight # in pounds, and if you eat at a caloric deficit, you can continue building muscle while cutting fat. So for me, since I weigh 160lbs, then if I get ~160 grams of protein per day while eating at a caloric deficit (~2200 for me), I lost BF% while building muscle.  I've stopped caring about my weight and focused in on BF%. Last I checked I was 162 at 12%, but that was 2 weeks ago, and I've ate like shit with fewer workouts in that time, so I'm probably closer to 165 at 14%. My goal is 10% with my weight between 155 and 165, going for that lanky-lean build..."
TheVeneration,3ale2g,Regalzack,2,Sun Jun 21 19:39:13 2015 UTC,You can't build new muscle mass when you are depriving your body the extra calories. Unless you are fairly overweight and new to lifting. Once that window has passed a caloric surplus is needed to gain muscle which includes gaining fat. There is the lean gains approach to this as well but it factors in a weekly deficit/surplus as opposed to a daily one.

This can be hard to come by, so I mostly ""cheat"" and use 1.5cl simple syrup (basically sugar dissolved in equal parts water) with some 8-10 drops of almond extract (depending on quality). Purists might hate the idea, but the extract gives a distinct marzipan sub-note that I haven't found in almond syrup.   1.5cl Orange Curacao (or Cointreau with a 0.5cl simple syrup for sweetness).  Mix everything in a shaker and shake well. Strain over a rocks glass filled with ice.  2cl El Dorado 8 year old rum (or any decent dark rum)  Float the dark rum over the back of a spoon to give the Mai Tai a festive two tone look.

I made sure on every rep that my hip-crease was slightly below my knees at the very bottom. It really does work your hips, hams and glutes harder.  I'm getting ready to head to the gym for upper-hypertrophy day right now. I can't believe my arms are still gaining about 1/8 an inch each week.(this will be week 5). Seeing measurements increase each week is a hell of a motivator. When I started this program 5 weeks ago my arms were 15"", now they are 15.5"" and if the trend continues 15.625"" sometime next week.

I love Harleys but... the Street 500 has nothing that makes Harleys different from metric bikes and is considered relatively mediocre from an objective standpoint. 600-750 Japanese cruisers can be had for cheap all day. They might not be significantly better but they're significantly cheaper.

TheVeneration,3a3lef,Merchantmarinesea,2,Wed Jun 17 02:48:05 2015 UTC,Oh if you drop the file into illustrator you can get just the outline as well as the full colors. Here was the read through that gave me a better understanding of what I was doing.
TheVeneration,3a3lef,SDust15,2,Wed Jun 17 04:54:15 2015 UTC,"Here you go I adjusted the contrast then pulled the vectors from it, rotated it and retouched a few things. Also flattened out the layers so related objects are together, ie: Banner, Piston etc.. (Makes it easier for the screening dude) I tried to keep it dark so it can be visible on a grey T but let me know it it needs tweaks.  And Zack as for the shirt, no need brother.

TheVeneration,3a0u0l,onealjp,2,Tue Jun 16 10:02:26 2015 UTC,"So there's a guy that wants to trade a 1998 cbr600 for my non-running 1980 cb400t. He says that he bought it for his son, took it home and put it in the garage and hasn't been able to get it started since. Apparently it doesn't crank at all which leads me to believe that he doesn't have it in neutral while pulling the clutch (says he's a new rider so I don't think he quite understands). I'm conflicted, I don't know a whole lot of electrical but I also don't feel like dealing with my 400 anymore and this could potentially be an easy fix. What is everyone's thoughts? Trade or no trade?"

I think I may go to the gym to try and set a new Bench PR. Come home take a picture for WAYWT. I'd swing by inkbrigade to get the ball rolling on our merch, but I'll have to wait until tomorrow as they are closed. Maybe I'll get a ride in today before the big GOT season finale bbq at my friends place.  Or maybe I'll just have more long and drawn out stream of consciousness posts here.

So I will have to find something else for the patches (perhaps another jacket? :P )   Next thing Is My Moto license and a bike and some gear. Ooooo I can't wait.  Leather jacket + Jeans:Imgur  Another view of the Jacket: Imgur  Jacket patches it came with; Imgur  Imgur  Drive Jacket; Imgur  Imgur  New patches that need a home!:Imgur  Imgur"

I can't find any with both long hair and a real beard, but here's some fairly long hair, really greasy/flat/unkempt, to give you an idea of the length, back when I weighed ~245 lbs.

Great weather all weekend, enjoyed the small beer and wine festival (picked up a bottle of wine and sixer of beer while there). I was fan-girl-ing when I saw stores like Danner Boots and Tanner Goods so that was nice to take in a little bit of the city and walk around.  The girlfriend and I are moving ~35 miles south (to Mukilteo) into a MIL basement apartment.

Not exactly the style I fantasized about, but after speaking with one of the sales associates I immediately discounted leather. I ride in NorCal and summers can easily hit 100F+ so I didn't want to marinate in my own sweat under a leather jacket.

TheVeneration,38848a,SupriseGinger,5,Tue Jun 2 15:06:56 2015 UTC,"You can't go wrong with the Honda in terms of relative performance and reliability.  In terms of comfort, though, it may not be an ""all day"" bike.  The 300F is a tad cheaper, and the handlebars sit you up a bit further, so that may be better if you're looking to ride more than a couple hours.    On the other hand...if you're a fan of the way Triumphs look, and you're looking for a small-displacement bike to learn on, it's worth throwing a leg over the TU250.  You're spending just about as much, though the performance is down, from the Honda.    Lastly, there are a lot of people who would suggest that your first bike not be a new one.  I tend to agree with those people, if for no other reason than cost.  A gently used Honda 250r can be had for under $2000.  When you're ready to move up, you can just about make your money back.  I've seen similar prices for the Rebel."

TheVeneration,38848a,BetaRayBillyMays,3,Wed Jun 3 05:09:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's a full size bike but it's not huge, just the perfect middle ground. I'm currently working on a 500, not a huge motor, but a perfect little in town bike. They've got enough power to get you out of trouble, but not so big you get into it."

The Honda Rebel will not be more comfortable either for long trips or 2 people. And especially since you're buying newer, there's much better ways to spend your money. Speed Triple is too much bike for a new rider and between the Thruxton and the Iron, just go for a test ride and see which one you like better."

TheVeneration,38778x,artofsushi,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:51:15 2015 UTC,"I saw it twice in 3D. I enjoyed the depth of field it added to the movie. And they thankfully only had one ""thing springing from the screen at your face"" moment, and it made at least a little sense in context.  I do hear that seeing it in 2D means it's a little brighter, and you can see a bit more detail, like individual grains of dust during storms and such.  Either way, it's a fantastic film, and well worth seeing. It quickly became my #1 film of all time, beating out Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Empire Strikes Back, and Captain America: Winter Soldier for top of my must-see-films list.

With summer around the corner, the boots are getting a bit hot to wear while my vans are getting a bit worn-out. I've owned a pair of cheaper Bucks in the past, which I have liked and think might fit. Maybe looking for something a bit lighter-color as well, to contrast the darker chips.

Hopefully they will even finish it up while I am there. Might see if they have a cool knobby tire lying around I can get for cheap as well. Or maybe have them paint my pipes for me.

How much of the stuff that we keep in our wallets do we really use? That and I kept it in my back pocket which can cause terrible hip and back pain later on down the line. Physical therapists all suggest you don't keep a thick wallet in your back pocket.  So anyway, I downgraded in size to a simple slim design and it's been a game changer. I keep it in my front pocket, it's more secure there, and I only keep my ID, Cash, Cards. Nothing else. I can take on a few business cards if people hand them to me, I can pack $200 in 20's and 10's.. so yes, it fits more than what I keep, but it's basically as thin as one can get and therefore doesn't leave an imprint in my pants or a bulge that makes me sit at an angle.   http://bellroy.com/wallets/slim-sleeve-wallet  I totally dig it.

TheVeneration,376s50,1oftwoacquaintances,1 point,Mon May 25 21:33:19 2015 UTC,Why be nervous? If you're good at what you do and passionate it about then an interview is just another excuse to talk someone's ear off about something you love.
TheVeneration,376s50,artofsushi,2,Mon May 25 21:40:31 2015 UTC,"Because I'm introverted and hate talking about myself. I'd rather just go to work and put out amazing food. Thankfully, it's a phone interview, so my homework tonight is to write out my answers to the questions they're most likely to ask so I can just read from a script.   Still my words, but I won't have to worry about clamming up.  To put it into perspective: I've been interviewed for the same position at my current place of employment, with people I know well, and I choked up and bombed the interview.  This interview is with a different hotel in the chain. With people I don't know at all. Well, I know the Chef, but he won't be part of this interview."

From what I've researched the reason for the large air boxes and pressure system is to provide extra uumpff in the mid range while accelerating. Though with a slide carb it can be jetted and tuned to match the motor's fuel demand through all the revs. PM me if you'd like to know more.   Edit: The 1-2 is for my kz440.

The 1000lb is reflective of three lifts: Deadlift, Squat, and Bench. Wondering if anyone wants to join me in my quest to hit 1000lbs?  If so let me know and we can keep tabs on each other weekly in this thread.  My current totals (estimated from my 5rep max) are Deadlift:210, Squats:210, and Bench 200. For a cumulative total of ~620lbs. So yeah I have a long way to go. Although I'm expecting to make some large gains on the Deadlift as I've never really included them in my routines. And until recently I haven't really emphasized legs a whole lot, so I'm expecting to hit 700lbs within the next 2 months.

I started Strong Lifts and it works pretty well, and I do an hour on the elliptical in between the 3 work days (Sun Tue Thur- lift; Mon Wed- Cardio) and take fri/sat as rest days. Losing weight pretty quick by cooking veggie and lean protein (fish, chicken, squid, octopus).   Well, I goofed- the gym has a bench bar and a smith machine (the squat rack with the ratchety wire things so you don't fuck up and kill yourself). The smith machine bar weighs 8 kilos, so I thought the bench press bar did too. I'm new to the gym, right? I was doing p90x before. I didn't know. So the squats are tough, and I'm doing the weights, and the bench press is tough, and the over head lifts are killing me. Then I realize that the Bench press bar is bigger than the smith bar, so i asked the staff. Bam! it weighs 20 kilos.   I spent 3 weeks doing Deadlift, Bench Press, Bent Over Row, and Overhead Press loading 16 kilos over the guide. So I tried to get back but the weights are too light so now I'm going to keep going until I hit my limits, which is the core idea anyway.  Also, I just broke 100 kilos, (222) pounds! My goal is 190 or 185. I haven't been that thin in years and I put on a lot of muscle so I don't know what weight I'm aiming for. I know what body I want and I'm working on that."

Then head along the Mississippi River valley to Lake City (Lake Peppin) for one of the most beautiful stretches of road in America. Lake City MN is where water skiing was invented. Then head west to Faribault and check out the Faribault Woolen Mill.  If you're going West, go to Montana. The drive between Missoula and Glacier National Park is INSANELY beautiful, especially the first half between Missoula and Flathead Lake. (Seriously, just go to Google Maps and check out a street view anywhere along the route between Flathead and Missoula along US-93.) The world's quaintest town is Polson, MT at the far southern end of Flathead Lake. Around the lake itself there are a lot of vinyards and orchards, and you can walk away with some delicious cherries or wine in the right times of year. It's the largest lake in the US by volume west of the Mississippi, and the water itself is crystal clear. If you're into this sort of thing, it's worth renting a kayak in Polson and just kinda kayaking around for a while."

Watching it I was amazed at how insane the stunts and angles we're. I read that after a screening Robert Rodriguez stood up and yelled ""how the fuck did you film that?""  Damn good movie."
