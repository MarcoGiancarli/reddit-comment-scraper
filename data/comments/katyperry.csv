It was entertaining – if you're a fan I'd recommend watching it.    If I put my critical thinking cap on, I can't help but notice by putting on such a crazy and fun show, sometimes she runs around, loses her breath, and then can't finish a verse.  I haven't seen too many other concert films, but I imagine this happens to every pop star that doesn't just stand still at a mic... She's in pretty good shape and she certainly gets enough practice (150 shows!).  I would guess in person you wouldn't notice because of all the excitement, but on video its pretty clear she's hauling ass across the stage.  To that point, I really enjoyed watching all the shenanigans on stage from multiple camera angles, which you wouldn't get if you just went to the show."

I counted around 20 of her songs which were 'co-written' by other studio musicians who help artists write songs for a living. And technically, yes it is collaboration which lots of musicians do, but those are usually one-offs.  Paying a studio musician to help you write your songs is essentially what I am talking about. I am not saying she has no talent at all, but she does need help to write her hit singles, which says something about her skill level.
