forwardsfromgrandma,3dzrnb,wheatley_cereal,7,Mon Jul 20 23:49:16 2015 UTC,"Although that's a popular idea, apparently that's not ideal. Some amount of debt is good, because debt and deficit spending can both be drivers of economic growth. If you invest a billion borrowed dollars into the country and grow the economy by two billion, that's a net gain. As long as economic growth exceeds deficit spending, the debt becomes smaller relative to GDP, which is what matters.  This was essentially what got Europe operational again after WW2. Massive investment led to economies that were in the toilet in 1945 growing by huge amounts throughout the fifties and sixties. Even though they carried heavy debt, this staggering economic growth shrank that debt.  The problem comes when you have deficits and austerity measures (or deficits used in non-economic ways such as endless foreign wars) because those stifle economic growth and result in the debt growing relative to GDP. This is sustainable, but not indefinitely. This is how the US got through that war and ended with an enormous debt, something like 140% GDP, but the postwar economic boom took care of that quite nicely."

They saw the chance to drain the Soviets of money and manpower in the same way that Americans did in Vietnam.   So guns were funneled into the rebels fighting the Soviets, but Pakistan saw this as an opportunity to pick and choose leaders in Afghanistan. So they demanded to be given the American weapons and supplies which they would distribute to the rebels. The CIA saw this as an opportunity to keep their hands clean from the war and not end up in another Vietnam type situation.   Pakistan was ruled at the time by a leader with a lot of Muslim zeal. So he redistributed the guns to groups that were extreme Muslims to gain favor in his own country. This eventually leads to extremist Muslims in the country being the most powerful of the rebel groups, and forming into the Taliban after the Soviets retreated and the United States lost interest.   TLDR: Pakistan is in charge of American weapons and supplies, gives them to radical Muslims, some of these radical muslims form the Taliban.

Either way, the result would ideally be people guaranteed at having basic needs paid for by some entity, whether it be the state itself or a private fund as is the case in the Alaskan Permanent Fund.   Work would be more for people who want more than basic cost of living covered, since there will definitely be jobs only humans can do, as everyone who did work would be getting paid on top of their stipend. This would probably be spent on luxuries or better accomodation.  Other options for people would include seeking an education while remaining financially stable, and there would probably be a LOT more people seeking a career in the arts, as it would eliminate almost all of the risk in doing so.

forwardsfromgrandma,3e0yyc,BritishHobo,4,Tue Jul 21 03:08:33 2015 UTC,"It has to do with how the battery measures its charge. Basically, it blasts radiation at the ""charged particles"" inside the battery. As it gets lower, more energy escapes as there is less particles to bounce directly back from. The last bar indicates less then 10% of the original blast is returning to photon receptors.   It is the same reason your battery will drop from 100 to 98 like immediately but then go down slow after that.   Also, it is true you shouldn't lay down after taking meds - the meds travel too quickly through receptors and it prevents their full effect. Just like legislation passes through Obama's America and is received by no one."

forwardsfromgrandma,3e0yyc,ConorPF,2,Tue Jul 21 14:07:35 2015 UTC,St. John's Wort   An analysis of twenty-nine clinical trials with more than five thousand patients was conducted by the Cochrane Collaboration. The review concluded that extracts of St John's wort were superior to placebo in patients with major depression. St John's wort had similar efficacy to standard antidepressants. Trials from German-speaking countries displayed findings that were more favorable to St. John's wort. The rate of patient drop-outs due to adverse effects was half that of newer SSRI antidepressants and one-fourth that of older tricyclic antidepressants. The report from the Cochrane Review states:   The available evidence suggests that the Hypericum extracts tested in the included trials a) are superior to placebo in patients with major depression; b) are similarly effective as standard antidepressants; and c) have fewer side-effects than standard antidepressants. The association of country of origin and precision with effects sizes complicates the interpretation.       Ginseng   There are not enough studies to reach definitive conclusions about its effectiveness for diabetes. There are not enough studies to draw definitive conclusions about whether ginseng affects erectile dysfunction.   Echinacea   There is no conclusive evidence showing that echinacea products treat or prevent the common cold.

Criminals are not a breed of people, nor are they some sort of animal. Being a criminal is not a lifestyle in itself, it's a societal label applied to someone for an action. In rare cases, it's a societal label applied without reason.  Anyone can become a criminal at any time as a result of their own actions, but few actually do. The reason why we want gun control is so that the only people with guns are the least likely to perform criminal behaviour. Not every future criminal has performed a crime beforehand."

More importantly, if the gun wasn't there to faciliate the action, they might still be alive today.  People don't understand that anyone can commit a crime.

forwardsfromgrandma,3dyyqg,Dispro,10,Mon Jul 20 19:32:43 2015 UTC,True. But I must add that there are ridiculous amounts of homeless vets because there isn't enough money put into the aftercare side of things.

forwardsfromgrandma,3dyyqg,Dispro,2,Mon Jul 20 20:41:19 2015 UTC,"If we're talking strictly about OIF/OEF vets, it's not that cut and dry and wasn't my experience. A lot of my Army friends I keep up with have PTSD and have been taken care of pretty well, both during and after their enlistments. The vets who struggle the most are the ones who had disciplinary problems while they were in the service. A lot of people join the military thinking it will fix major personal problems that the civilian world couldn't.   The truth is that if you can't function in the military where you're told exactly what to do and provided everything essential to live, you're going to have an even harder time functioning in the real world.  I work with a lot of Vietnam War vets and compared to the veteran services they got, ours are gold."

Also this didn't happen   Then they came for the Christians and I praised their attacks because I was an atheist.   Bullshit.  I'm an atheist and I'd be the first to stand up for you.  Guess what Christians!  NO matter how hard you yell persecution its not happening to you!  Tell me more how I'm going to hell though thats always nice.  This never happened either.

It just assumes that the only difference with LGBT people is that they engage in same-sex sex, completely and utterly ignoring all other romantic aspects of their lives. Like two men walking down the street holding hands is somehow an affront that should be kept in the bedroom, or two women kissing each other on the cheek is something that should be confined to the bedroom, even though opposite-sex couples do that stuff all the goddamn time.  It's a passive phrase straight people can use to show that they have the absolute minimum acceptance of LGBT relationships (that they aren't for outright banning what people do in private) while also enabling them to distance themselves from actually having to interact or acknowledge their romantic attractions.

forwardsfromgrandma,3dtybt,AdrianBrony,12,Sun Jul 19 22:05:56 2015 UTC,"it's the most bullshit thing I can think of in media right now, people saying with a straight face ""oh do you think a non-straight romance is kid appropriate though?"" in a show that's explicitly shown straight couples kissing on closeup, in detail, maybe even implying sexual activity having happened off camera.   Because as soon as it's a queer relationship, it's putting ""sexuality"" into a kid's show, as if hetero stuff isn't already sexuality. or that a kid is ""too young to have an orientation"" while at the same time nobody thinks anything of even pre-teens having hetero crushes and puppy love."
forwardsfromgrandma,3dtybt,CaptchaInTheRye,2,Sun Jul 19 23:09:16 2015 UTC,"In my experience, most of them are well-meaning, but have really shitty info.  When someone is indoctrinated into a belief system that tells them from birth that gays are going to burn in hell, you can certainly understand them being concerned.  They are taught, relentlessly, that being gay is as bad as rape, or fucking an animal.  If a child did any of those things in a lighthearted sitcom, there would be a deserved backlash.  So the problem isn't that these are shitty people.  In fact, most of them are moral people.  They are just working off of shitty information drilled into their heads by their religions."
forwardsfromgrandma,3dtybt,AdrianBrony,3,Mon Jul 20 08:08:22 2015 UTC,"See, the thing is, I'd say most actual homophobia I notice these days isn't really religiously based. I mean the most vicious of homophobes are usually religious, but more commonly I'd say a lot of homophobia is from people who think they're being reasonable and evenhanded on the matter.   They're people who say ""I don't have a problem with gay people just don't shove it down our throats"" or ""yeah but we should keep kids from being exposed to it until they're old enough to decide for themselves."" or ""but why does all these movies need gay/lesbian characters instead of just normal characters.""  The real villain here isn't really religion, it's heteronormativity. The notion that heterosexuality is the default, and that everyone is straight by default. They say they're fine with queer people as long as they look and act EXACTLY like they do, lest they get uncomfortable with it. It's an insidious mindset that even completely secular people have and they would rather silence queer voices and experiences for their own comfort."
forwardsfromgrandma,3dtybt,CaptchaInTheRye,3,Mon Jul 20 08:21:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with 90% of what you wrote here; but it's bizarre to me to say that a religion which prescribes beating the shit out of gay people with rocks until they bleed to death has NO part in shaping the way people think about homosexualit.  Like, completely zero.  How can that be?  There are people who are religious, for whatever reason, and dont subscribe to this bullshit.  And I applaud them!  But the religion itself doesn't get to be let off the hook just because some people who follow it edit out the shitty parts (and then claim that the shitty parts don't exist/are misinterpreted etc.)."
forwardsfromgrandma,3dtybt,AdrianBrony,2,Mon Jul 20 08:46:56 2015 UTC,"I never said it played no part, I'm just saying it isn't really the root of the problem IMO. It might be the seed from which the problem has grown, but the root of the problem is much different now.  Even if it started it, going after religion would just be a wild goose chase at this point. The longer we focus on them, the longer the actual causes of modern heteronormative stigma will go on pretending that they're the good guys.   Plus I don't think religion was the SOLE originator of this in the first place. just a major contributor in the past. Of course there's plenty of religious hatred of LGBT+ people, but in the present day, there are more pervasive and fundamental sources for it now that everyone contributes to even unknowingly."

I don't want to outlaw it or regulate it or anything (other than (a) ensuring that they don't break any secular laws, and (b) making them pay taxes).

There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!  The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.  The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.  Semper Fi. p.s. close the borders"

forwardsfromgrandma,3dqmlk,regeya,-1,Sun Jul 19 02:25:00 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, and since you ask a serious question, I'll give a serious answer.  Look, I may not agree with Islam, but ever since 9/11/2001, people that idiots think are Muslim have gotten handed the shitty end of the stick.  Sikhs got the shit beat out of them on 9/11.  Christians from the Middle East get randomly checked.  Basically, anyone brown that doesn't look Mexican or Italian or whatever gets shit on.  And it's a mistake liberal grandma and conservative grandma both make.  ""We need to be stopping every one of those dirty ragheads!""  Well, great idea!  Except it doesn't work.  Militant groups have been recruiting white people to be jihadis.  Targeting brown Middle-Eastern looking people isn't just racist, it's worthless.  Then liberal grandma pipes in.  So conservative grandma pipes in with some crap about Obama being tight with his friends in ISIS.  Liberal grandma screeches, ""That's racist!""  Well...is it?  ""Muslim"" isn't a race.  And I know that people get bent out of shape and say, ""Well, so what?!"" to that, because they claim it's a derailing technique racists use.  No, it isn't!  This is important!  Talking about Islam as if it's a race perpetuates the stupid racist myth that Muslims are Middle-Easterners.  I live in the Midwest in a real armpit section of it.  Conservative Grandma was well aware of Obama's raising, thank you, and is well aware that he's half-white, half-black, not Middle-Eastern, but is still pissed that he was raised that way, and even holds it against him that his middle name is Hussein (which would be like holding a grudge against a German for being named Adolph, but I digress).    If you insist on perpetuating the myth that Muslims are a race, you're reaffirming the boneheaded notion that racial profiling will ""fix"" terrorism.  EDIT:  Unsubscribing.  I get it, you want to call out other people's racism, but don't like to be challenged on your own, or even be questioned on why your own stubbornness is helping to perpetuate bigotry.  It's okay, check the posts in this sub, you're in good company, the world's full of you.  When Grandma ties Obama to ISIS, she's not being racist, you fuckwits.  Sure, she might be racist in other ways and think that other Muslims are brown Middle-Easterners by default (and vice-versa), but that's because she's a blithering idiot.  I can't help it that she gets confused by Malaysian Muslim women or blonde-haired, blue-eyed Iranians."

I would put it on pretty good authority that the people who post this kind of stuff have never spent a considerable amount of time with anybody who has been on welfare or has been in prison for an extended period of time. If they did, they'd probably realize that people on welfare are usually just getting by (yes, there's corruption, but that's no reason to categorize everyone who receives welfare as corrupt), and that people who spend time in prison usually come out with their lives so fucked up it becomes nearly impossible to return to normal life.  They must think that their middle-class life is the worst it could possibly get in this country, and everyone else is just faking it."

I never abused it and only used what I needed and not wanted. I knew people who got the same welfare benefits and started to buy expensive clothes and go to expensive restaurant because the government was helping them. While I struggled with cold sandwiches and tap water because I felt to have welfare was kind of greedy. Once i got a good job. I immediately got off of it because I felt someone else was going through the same struggle. And seeing people act like this upsets how selfish people can be. And I feel there should be random checkups and if they see them abuse it . Just for their pleasure. They should remove them and have to pay back what they got

Not so short, it has two important parts, at the top we have   Int main(void)   This means the function is type: Integer.   That the function is called main (All programs have a main function, which... is the main one)  And ""(void)"" means it needs nothing to run.   return 0;   Return ends the function, and hands off something to the parent function (which doesn't exist here - so program ended), since this is an integer function it has to hand off an integer, and 0 is what is usually used, I think because error handling tradition but I don't usually do that.

I think you're saying that of all people who came out as Trans, Jenner had an easier time than most because of his fame, wealth, and status. While many Trans folk before him didn't have any of that and were therefore shoved pretty far down by a hateful and ignorant society.  I'll agree that he financially has it easier than 99 percent of other Transgendered people (many of whom lose quite a lot), I think his reputation and social status instantly made him even more of a target. Brave, but in a different way.  He wouldn't be killed or financially ruined, but being instantly famous for his decision to go public is another sort of bravery.   (Used ""him"" to depict Bruce's decision to become Caitlyn)"
forwardsfromgrandma,3drj2u,nomorerope,0,Sun Jul 19 12:33:41 2015 UTC,I agree with this not to mention Jenner came out in a time where hundreds of millions of people are giving him support.  Surrounded by family friends and fans calling him a hero every day in a society that is pretty progressive.  The decision itself was a personal one not meant to benefit society... although of course that's nice for trans people to see a public figure to feel less isolated... but hero status?
forwardsfromgrandma,3drj2u,VaginalBurp,0,Sun Jul 19 18:28:17 2015 UTC,Yes. He literally has TEAMS of PR people that set everything up. He's not a hero. To compare him to soldiers is also just inviting hate.

It's a position which presents itself as being part of the solution (""I think charaties should be helping the poor"") when it is part of the problem: you oppose the existence of the only reliable and efficient safety net that can protect them from the ups and downs and inherent disparaties of the economy.  It's not that I think charity institutions are evil, they do good work in many areas, the problem is they could never replace the government: the only institution which is both powerful and centralised, and at the same time headed by democratically elected officials who are held publicly accountable for their actions and how they use that enormous power.

But of course they're being enormously hypocritical, since the Catholic church has always oppossed progressive, popular governments and has instead favoured right-wing, socially callous ones -- and in my country's case even far-right dictatorships that set up concentration camps for those who opposed them.  What you describe in American conservatives I see in the younger generation here, who are mostly immune to most of the Catholic church's preachings. The key aspect of this is a total lack of compassion and empathy, a built-in inability to think of poor, disadvantaged people's situation from their perspective.

Basically, Baptist churches don't typically have a hierarchy. The power of a given church begins and ends at the congregation. The pastor or minister doesn't even have actual authority as they are only there at the will of the churchgoers, they're typically more of an overseer. Really it's basically religious anarchism.   Since there's no official organization between congregations like almost every other denomination, this leads to a very isolated community in most baptist churches. Which leads to a fishbowl mindset. Which leads to rampant gossip.   Thus, they'll pretend not to know each other at a hooters to avoid becoming the target of that gossip."

You were like ""America is a democratic nation, so you have to get the majority of the votes to be our president"" when the truth is that your system doesn't at least favour that, it's just what happens to occur in most elections, but not in the 2000.

It's great how CGP Grey uses the ""Animal Kingdom"" to keep people from rejecting the ideas he conveys because they might see them partisan (namely, FPTP appears to favour the GOP more than the Democratic Party, although the latter is also sometimes favoured, as it's shown in the Trouble With The Electoral College video).  They also discuss the alternatives to FPTP, there pro's and con's, and how really any system which is a little more proportional is actually better than FPTP, not just because of individual elections, but because he shows how FPTP may be the main reason why the US has the current steadfastly two-party system that has caused so, so much damage to its democracy.

Do you ask everyone about their genetalia or is that ""special"" treatment for trans people? (And this is coming from a trans person who, at this moment in time, has no desire to have any reconstruction surgery)   The post is right though. A lot of trans people don't want reconstruction done because it's expensive, imperfect, dangerous, feels unnecessary. You name it. That doesn't make them any less trans or suddenly makes them a sexual deviant. They just found their limit and want to stay there. People should learn to respect that.   In this case, it's being used as a means to discredit her and what she's doing. If she ever does have any reconstruction done, they'll still be on her. They just don't have the ""oh well she hasn't had the surgery done yet!"" excuse."

forwardsfromgrandma,3djjqw,Megaman03,12,Fri Jul 17 01:40:44 2015 UTC,"Could they have saved everyone?  Maybe not, but they definitely could've saved more than they did.  Unfortunately, by 2077 the United States was effectively under the control of a shadow government (which would go on to form the Enclave) consisting of major corporations (including Vault-Tec), high-ranking military officials, and important politicians.  The purpose of the Vault program was to experiment on small, controlled populations, to gain knowledge on developing an outer space colonization program.  Saving humanity was never the purpose, it was simply a cover to gain test subjects.  If anyone has no idea what we're talking about, it's Fallout."
forwardsfromgrandma,3djjqw,ByzantineWinnebago,7,Fri Jul 17 01:50:31 2015 UTC,"I mean, not everyone everyone. By 2077, I think it was quite obvious that the United States government wouldn't save literally everyone. I think that the population of the Vaults could have been viable, at least until the radiation of the outside world subsided. From what I understand, the Vaults were used to conduct social experiments on their inhabitants, failed or were wiped out from other factors. The elite would be safe and sound on Poseidon and when the Enclave would eventually return, I'm sure they would want some semblance of the ""pure"" America they worship.   But you're right, I suppose. The non-control Vaults were little more than covers for test subjects for these social experiments. As for space exploration, I think they severely miscalculated on the probability of nuclear war and underestimated how close they were to annihilation. I mean, REPCONN was only purchased in 2075 and even then, they turned towards military research."

Child maintenance is paid directly or indirectly by an obligor to an obligee for the care and support of children of a relationship that has been terminated, or in some cases never existed.

There has also been a big push over the last few years by Republican state governors to subject people to a drug test in order to get public benefits. The humor comes from the fact that many of the same Republicans that so strongly believe in drug testing recipients of public aid are the same ones who identify as evangelical Christians and preach about making the government more Christian. It's a humorous contrast between the stories of Jesus in the Bible and the attitudes of those who now claim to follow him most closely.

I'm not here to prove your religion is invalid, I just want to explain my view. I do not believe that ""no greater context exists BECAUSE I do not need it."" I believe that ""because there is no greater context, I must rely on myself and other humans"". That's a huge difference.   Plus my post was not about that. It was pointing out that some Christians, when faced with a challenge mentally, emotionally, financially, etc, they will say ""trust in God and rely on him for strength."" And then, they wait. They wait for God to come through for them and give them the solution. But in my experience, you have to go out and fix it yourself. Get the gears turning and talk to other people who can help you. Yes, Christians will do that as well, but when the problem is solved, they give the credit to God. Even though  the credit should be going to the people involved."
