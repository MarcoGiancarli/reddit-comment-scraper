MillerPlanetside,3e3bjd,Definia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:08 2015 UTC,I actually disagree. I've died about 5 times total to this exploit which in the scheme of things isn't really too bad. 5 deaths over how many months or non-stop bullshit whenever I try and use a grenade. (Not to mention the number of times you get TK'd by friendlys who's grenades don't behave like they expect them to). But I seem to be in a minority.
MillerPlanetside,3e3bjd,_LSI_,2,Tue Jul 21 17:17:42 2015 UTC,"I die to it more than i'd like or I have mentioned. Between fort liberty windows, spawn room/teleporter shields and the side of biolab shields at the landing pads it's just fucking gay. (and as far as im aware, you put mines through the bioshields too)  It's dumb they just can't fix the shit instead of bring out another bug to fix a bug is laughable.   I get what you're saying though"
MillerPlanetside,3e3bjd,Violonc,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:23:33 2015 UTC,Spawn room warrior problems?  Haven't died to it for a long time either. The beach balls will up the TKs that honestly will annoy (and affect) me more. It's sad that there is no fix in sight as they'd have to rewrite a core part of the physics engine. :-/

You should stick to normal stereo. We have two ears ^ ^  And honestly, switching sound cards won't improve the sound quality. Maybe a tiny bit if you have a really expensive one or that you need pre amplification for your mic (if that card has a pre amp)   Otherwise, all it will do is offer you the possibility add weird fake surround effects for headphones."

We are a spanish speaking outfit and I am the only leader (sadly) able to cooperate correctly in english with other outfits and I've been absent from the game for 2 months and slowly coming back. THIS doesn't mean we do absolutely nothing, every fucking day, sometimes twice a day we have organised teamplay and we are able to pull pretty awesome stuff by ourselves.  Server Smash wise, we've signed up for (almost) every smash possible since Merge (included). Everytime we played we held strong our lanes and did our job (there are exeptions ofc). It's true that we are a bit ""absent"" in meetings where I don't talk at all because I don't feel the need to...that's why maybe you don't know us.

MillerPlanetside,3dzass,JA3GUER,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:34 2015 UTC,Hola ! Nice to meet you :)
MillerPlanetside,3dzass,FRDocHolliday,52,Tue Jul 21 18:55:01 2015 UTC,"And... here.... we.... go....       REBR - we have not even seen these guys for ages don't even know them have never played with them or had friends there... FHM - Again never heard of the gezzers ES - who are these guys ?   Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Darthsebious, ex leader of the Rebel Rifles (REBR), current member of INI and play with both on a regular basis. I've been playing since the beta of the game. I've been a server rep for Woodman, played in pretty much all the server smashes for both Woodman and Miller and have platoon and squad led on 90% of those matches. You mention that you feel that because I play a lot with INI now, it's somehow unjust that you shouldn't PL and I should get the job. I'm sorry, I didn't realise you were keeping tabs on my gameplay time. You say I play more VS these days. Why? Because I threw up a video a few days ago saying I'd been playing VS. Funnily enough, I was playing them to prep for the next server smash as our second choice was VS. Preparing for all outcomes of the server smash would be fine with you right?      You say I got in because I'm friends with Napoleon. Well you'd be right in some regards. I've  worked with Napoleon in the past and I'd go so far as to say we act in a friendly manner towards each other. It's amazing what happens when you actually do that. I'm also friends with many other members of the Miller community. Some Bazino level of conspiracy theory bullshit right here (just kidding Bazino ;-)). Believe it or not, I asked for UFO to join the platoon for the next match because you're a capable outfit and I looked forward to working with you in the preparation of the match.  Would I get in based on just friendship alone. Nope, not a chance. You know why? Because Napoleon isn't a fucking idiot and neither is the rest of the force command.      As for the outfits that you mention here. You say you don't know them. Not once to my knowledge have you ever tried to get in contact with any of the said outfits above. You've not seen REBR for ages and yet you don't know them? Pick one mate. Never had any friends there? I take it the two hours I spent chatting to you, helping you out trying to figure out if your system is capable of streaming PS2 wasn't enough for you right? How about a good word when you approached INI to talk about joint ops (even when you're hardly the most popular person within that outfit). You say that we need to be open and learn to respect people's opinions. You're absolutely right. You might want to try thinking about that next time you post something along the lines of this post.      FHM are one of the most capable outfits on the NC from our server.      ES (Escuadron de Sombras). Spanish outfit. Really solid group of guys. Quite nice too. You could go ask them but you'd probably wouldn't understand what they are saying just before you get kicked from their teamspeak.       We have been placed with 12 members only on this match which is not fair in my eyes seeing how bad my boys want this.       Well boo fucking hoo. You didn't get to bring more than 12. A lot of outfits who feel they should be able to bring players got to bring the whole total of, wait for it.... 0. It's admirable that you want the best for your outfit, but face facts here. Your still a young outfit.        I have clearly said we are a growing outfit still geling together and keep learning. We need to be placed with outfits that we can learn from, this being said we did state interest to team up with INI/VoGu/ViB/FoG/RO/BRTD with these teams I feel that my outfit members feel most comfortable with. 1.  When Miller needs UFOs I will not have a platoon lead that will make the wrong calls and mess up our team game and our effort to win the match. We fight for Miller not for our outfit pride, but if you take our pride and step on it and ask us to represent miller you are truly making us feel uncomfortable.  So you feel I will make bad calls and mess up the team.       Well, that's fine. You're allowed your opinion but allow me to say this. You clearly don't know a fucking thing about me bud. You have something to say about my platoon leading. Go ask around the community and see what answer you get. Am I the best? Most certainly not. Can I do my job to the best of my ability? You're damn fucking right I can.       I still don't understand how any of these force commanders get chosen or how they decide to chose their platoons leaders... In my opinion all our Force commanders are incapable of doing what needs to be done to win, apart from Fara and probably Desspa who will outsmart their opponents the rest should not even apply for Force Commanders and make way for people who can actually do the job.       See this is a really good way of not building relationships with other members/outfits. If anyone in the Miller community wants to see how an outfit leaders words can tarnish the rep of an outfit, you needn't look any further.       In fact, for the next server smash tournament, you should put yourself forward and see how many people actually want you to lead them. A good leader is respectful and in turn garners the respect from the people he/she leads. See how much you have when the votes cast.       Sorry it might look like shots fired but someone has to speak the truth...       Nah, not the truth. Just your opinion. That's all. Everyone has one and the majority of them mean fuck all.      TL;DR - Fucking read it you bunch of lazy bastards ;-)"

MillerPlanetside,3dzass,Conchubair,25,Tue Jul 21 11:48:02 2015 UTC,"The day of reckoning has finally come. I wondered how much time we should wait until you will finally show your true nature. After pinching top players from many other outfits and spreading bullshit about our outfit after the fact we have refused to merge with you, karma has finally found you. Thanks God we have managed to refuse the proposal under your harmful and toxic influence. Thanks to your persuading skills, plenty of nice players from UFO will probably defend you until the time when your boat end up under the water and it is really sad. I wonder which version of the cave story you sold them after my attempt to take a firm stand and show you in a polite way that we will not tolerate the pinching procedure. Back then, you insulted me, but told to myself ""fuck it, let it be like that"" and longly waited to see a different attitude. But no, nothing has changed. As I told you few months ago, we are different - I will never do everything to achive my goals at all costs. You are truly obsessed with the idea of being an elite outfit. I'm not the guy who likes to throw a stone at anyone, but after all the things I have seen, I will be pleased to see the witch burning."
MillerPlanetside,3dzass,funkykovalPL,22,Tue Jul 21 09:07:50 2015 UTC,"WALL OF TEXT, MOTHAFUCKA!!!  '  '   REBR - we have not even seen these guys for ages don't even know them have never played with them or had friends there... FHM - Again never heard of the gezzers ES - who are these guys ?   So due to your own ignorance of other outfits you are withdrawing your guys from the fight? Ok, fine, though that kinda makes this next sentence void of meaning.   We have been placed with 12 members only on this match which is not fair in my eyes seeing how bad my boys want this.   It's also highly likely that other outfits have guys that really want to play in the match, however a line has to be drawn somewhere.   I have clearly said we are a growing outfit still geling together and keep learning.   That's completely on you, there is no rules or requirement that you have to gel and learn in SS, that can be done on live.   We need to be placed with outfits that we can learn from, this being said we did state interest to team up with INI/VoGu/ViB/FoG/RO/BRTD with these teams I feel that my outfit members feel most comfortable with.   OK cool, what if you aren't who they want to team with? They should just accept you into their team because you demand it? This doesn't work that way chief.   When Miller needs UFOs I will not have a platoon lead that will make the wrong calls and mess up our team game and our effort to win the match.   Firstly, the majority of PLs on smashes are experienced and trusted players and S/PLs that will have the backing of their squads, platoons and the FC. Secondly, go fuck yourself with that ""mess up our team game"" etc, SS is about the servers team game, not yours. If you PL/FC needs you to do something that is a little out of your comfort, then you do it....sure you let them know its not a strength or something you are used to, but you get on with it because thats what they need from you.   If this server ever needs UFOs in a match again then we are here to answer the call but we will have our requirements met or disregarded like on this match vs connery.   If that is your attitude then i foresee a looooooong wait time until you guys (that supposedly are really aching to play in SS) are seen on the team roster again. Your preferences are just that, preferences. They don't have to override all others and the team managers have done their best to stick to those preferences i'd assume, but sorry, seems like the outfits you want to be carried by don't want you, move on.   I still don't understand how any of these force commanders get chosen or how they decide to chose their platoons leaders... In my opinion all our Force commanders are incapable of doing what needs to be done to win, apart from Fara and probably Desspa who will outsmart their opponents the rest should not even apply for Force Commanders and make way for people who can actually do the job.   Ok cool, nice opinion. But.....who the fuck are you anyway? Sure my playtime has dropped hugely lately due to reasons, but i have no idea who you or UFOs are, or why i should care what your opinion of the FCs, that have worked tirelessly to get the best results for the server during their tenure as FC, should be.  I feel sorry for the members of your outfit that apparently really want to participate in the Server Smash matches, but now will not get that chance.  TL:DR. You didn't get placed with exactly the outfits you wanted, have thrown teddy out of the pram and are having a tantrum until everyone bows to your desires and puts you where you want to play, over anyone else's wants."

If you and your guys are so into serversmash, why are you ruining your chances like that?  Makes no sense..."
MillerPlanetside,3dzass,Imrkil,31,Tue Jul 21 09:43:24 2015 UTC,"Mad, you're a fucking joke.  REBR, FHM and ES are competent, long-standing outfits and have contributed a LOT more to the server as a whole than UFOs ever have.  Just because you got picked to play in your big boy pants on the EliteSmashTM versus Briggs doesn't give you the right to act the way you're acting. Then again there are just some people who never change.  What gives UFOs the right to more than 12 people anyway? I don't see INI/MCY/VIB/VoGu requesting more people or crying about it when they don't get it.  This is a serversmash, not a UFOsmash.  Having said that, you've pretty much smashed UFOs reputation right into the ground.  To current and future Force Commanders. Please, if you get the option, choose someone other than UFOs for every upcoming server smash. Idiots like this don't deserve to play or represent Miller with that attitude."
MillerPlanetside,3dzass,Vaeka,17,Tue Jul 21 01:05:16 2015 UTC,"Semi-related note: I'd call anyone with half a brain who is currently part of UFO's to abandon ship. Unfortunately, outfit rep is directly determined by your outfit leader and the last thing I'd want, if I was in your situation, is for someone to say ""Oh, you're in UFOs? You must be as much of a cunt as the leader then.""  Then again i'm probably barking up the wrong tree considering 60% of UFO's members were poached from SCEV.All BR100's too because we need dat leaderboard xp to feel validated!"

I think you lot, and a lot of other people need to take a very long and hard look at themselves at this point. A lot of people on all sides of the recent conflict has acted arrogant, childish and way out of line. Now we're finally (sorta) coming together as a server again, but the only way we'll get anywhere is with compromise - from all parties involved. I'm not saying that i expect peoples attitudes be changed over night, but if nothing changes, and we don't start working together we'll all fail. If the first thing you do when things not go your way is to rage quit, well then, in my honest opinion, you're weak and childish. Instead of giving up (and your text really reads like you wanna look like some sort of martyr in the eyes of the ""eliteside""), then prove yourself as the high qualty outfit you obviously view yourself as, and carry your platoon. Play with them on live, get to know them, and teach them what you can. And what do you know, they might surprise you.  Sorry if this came across as preachy, but i will not have my time, and the time of my pilots wasted on these matches if our ground forces collapse because they refuse to get over their petty differences."
MillerPlanetside,3dzass,SebABTF,5,Tue Jul 21 10:15:35 2015 UTC,like you said. we are finally working towards something and this thread appears.   kosovan should have posted on eliteside and go around and speak with others. starting drama hurts his outfit and to some extent the server.   all the outfits involved are making sacrifices. why aren't they?
MillerPlanetside,3dzass,desspa,5,Mon Jul 20 19:32:11 2015 UTC,Am in REBR and on eliteside. Already seen a bunch of eliteside guys also comment how stupid this is. Eliteside is well...

FHM - Again never heard of the gezzers ES - who are these guys ?   REBR, FHM and ES guys are solid outfits, more notorious than UFO, they're active and they play very well, if not better than your team. You could learn a lot from them, why don't you play with them and see if you can teach them ? Are you conscious you look arrogant ?   I have clearly said we are a growing outfit still geling together and keep learning. We need to be placed with outfits that we can learn from, this being said we did state interest to team up with INI/VoGu/ViB/FoG/RO/BRTD with these teams I feel that my outfit members feel most comfortable with.   You can't have everything mate, you should feel happy to participate in SS, you know a lot of outfits don't play but would be happy to. Are you conscious you look selfish and childish ? Imo you take this ""elite circlejerking"" thing too seriously.   Sorry it might look like shots fired but someone has to speak the truth...   I think you should delegate the diplomatic part of your team leading job to someone more diplomat, it could be better for the image of your outfit. And what appears to you as the ""truth"" is just your truth, everyone has it's own opinion."

When I switched to SAS-r and put radar on his ass he got flanked and killed with a HS - so if wanting to beat him it was more than doable. But when I meet someone who is doing so much better at HA then I want to go up against him on even odds (as much as the game allows) and try to see what I am doing wrong and learn from my misstakes.

MillerPlanetside,3dhwgw,Havetts,4,Thu Jul 16 12:51:33 2015 UTC,"I assume this was last night? There was a moment when we pushed the Hurakan north satellite, which was largely empty whilst the NC were messing about trying to get into the Amp Station proper.  We had a sneaky sundy in the hollow tree nearby. It was all like ""yeah, totally gonna get in there before they know what's happening.""  I spawn at the sundy. See RPS heading up the hollow tree ahead of me. See a Reaver hover at one end of it and I knew immediately what was happening...  I'm not ashamed to say I simply cowered behind the sundy. Not gonna be another fish for your barrel...  Kinda took the shine off me popping your Reaver with a AT turret earlier in the night though..."
MillerPlanetside,3dhwgw,Cooper42,3,Thu Jul 16 13:49:32 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah, it was from last night. I followed 252's platoon around in my Reaver doing A2G support all alert long. That hollow tree provided a lot of kills as well, but in the end we couldn't keep you from getting to the base.  Also, great shot with the AT turret :p"
MillerPlanetside,3dhwgw,eltdown,2,Thu Jul 16 13:53:27 2015 UTC,"I was expecting to see that hollow tree as soon as I clicked (I remember turning round, seeing a frigging ABTF Reaver hovering 20m away pointing towards me then ducking behind some rocks), but clearly there were more abundant crops elsewhere."

MillerPlanetside,3di0w1,PhysicsManUK,7,Thu Jul 16 14:10:28 2015 UTC,"Lol, you're VS. You have no right to complain about zergs when it's the only thing 90% of your faction does. Everyone know that if you wanna ""win"" a fight against VS, you need maximum overpop, or else you'll get dropped on by half the VS population.  Sorry if it's difficult to find good fights, but there is noone but the VS to blame."
MillerPlanetside,3di0w1,SebABTF,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:44:03 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if you're serious or not, but to solely blame VS is a serious case of ignorance.  Yesterday, for example, VS and TR were having a nice 50/50 fight on Sungrey when suddenly FU and GOON along with a few other TR outfits arrive to massively overpop the base and completely destroy the fight (with tonnes of Maxes too). They did this for a good hour or so to every TR/VS fight, even the other TR players (whom just wanted to fight a nice battle) were getting pissed off with GOON/FU in yell chat; and for good reason of course.  Simple fact of the matter is that all factions zerg in roughly equal measure, I see no good evidence to suggest VS zergs more than TR or NC."
MillerPlanetside,3di0w1,FlagVC,2,Thu Jul 16 14:05:17 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that all factions zerg. That's not my point. My point is that VS zergs all the time - be it prime time, alerts or 4am. There is always a VS zerg that does nothing but overpop base after base after base. And don't get me wrong, i'm not complaining about it. They provide excellent farms to grind directives. But imagine what you experienced yesterday for an hour, but now imagine it's been like that for half a year. Every base you go to, there is a big chance that you'll get dropped by countless lemmings and countless force multipliers. That is why some NC and TR commanders won't fight VS without a significant overpop"
MillerPlanetside,3di0w1,SebABTF,2,Thu Jul 16 14:11:46 2015 UTC,"It's your accusatory tone towards all of VS that I take issue with, I'm sure (I hope) you understand that not all of VS zerg. A lot of us just want to have roughly even fights, the other factions zerging us because some of VS zerg you is not a good solution.  It's like the fire department letting someone's house burn down because they were having a cigarette in bed, but then the guy next door has his house destroyed by the fire too just because they wanted to teach the first guy a lesson."
MillerPlanetside,3di0w1,FlagVC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:16:54 2015 UTC,"I fully realize that not all VS does it, as i also said in my OP. It just so happens that a huge margin of VS does it.  I'm not a ground platoon leader, i have no say what so ever in how forces move across the map. I just say that i full well understand why people do what they do when fighting VS.  Also that blaming anyone else than the VS (that does it) is misplacing the blame"
MillerPlanetside,3di0w1,SebABTF,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:21:37 2015 UTC,"Really tho, if there's 12-24 in the base it's unlikely to be the zerglings."
MillerPlanetside,3di0w1,FlagVC,0,Thu Jul 16 14:40:23 2015 UTC,"That's not the point. The point is, that there is high likelihood that 1-2 minute after you engage in a fair fight you'll get massively dropped on - so the NC bring enough people to be prepared for that eventuality."
MillerPlanetside,3di0w1,SebABTF,3,Thu Jul 16 14:43:48 2015 UTC,"So instead of waiting to see if it actually happens (and since it was an attack they'd have to go by galaxy, which you can see on the map/deal with) NC went ahead and mega-zerged us ""just to be sure""?   Sigh."
MillerPlanetside,3di0w1,CungaLungaa,4,Thu Jul 16 14:45:51 2015 UTC,"As i said, noone but the VS to blame. I agree it's lazy, but i can't say i blame the NC in this case."

When we're roaming around we try to never fight overpop if at all possible. So when someone like MCY, or INI (etc) don't care to do the same, I'm frankly disappointed."
MillerPlanetside,3di0w1,Whatupwidat,2,Thu Jul 16 14:30:11 2015 UTC,"The last VS techplant we got zerged out of with us at 30% pop had you in the hex in yell chat.   In your head, you probably chalked that up to too many VS responding to a fight that might have been fun. You didn't use it as an opportunity for introspection or wonder how this reflects on you as a player.  Everyone is guilty of being in a hex where their side has 51% pop but there is a subset of players that are all too willing to ignore it when they're the perpetrators."

MillerPlanetside,3di0w1,Definia,3,Thu Jul 16 16:22:57 2015 UTC,You missed the point of the post and your reply is implying that you have never overpopped a hex unless I post a screenshot. Please provide similar proof for your initial assumption that MCY was in the hex.  Let me prove you've overpopped with logic - Eurobob's last thread was about how no one was responding to his point holds. The other way to read that is that his platoon in those situations was overpopping the hex. Done.
MillerPlanetside,3di0w1,FlagVC,3,Thu Jul 16 16:34:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not denying having been in an overpop fight.  That said, when it happens I, like bob is likely to either apologize to the other side or to leave long before the fight ""concludes"".  Anyway, the reason I asked for a screenshot was more about it being a reminder for what techplant, when, and what happened around it at the time."

He banshees me and sends me to go AFKing in the warpgate. I've been farmed now, and my K/D hurts. I stay behind the Esamir warpgate and it's really cold. Suddenly, a warmth is moving towards me. It's Daddy. I am so happy. He whispers into my ear ""This is my Mossy."" He grabs me with his powerful Russian hands and puts me on top of the glowing platform in the middle of the warpgate. I'm ready. I open my Killboard for Daddy. He reks my K/D. It hurts so much, but I do it for Daddy. I can feel my K/D dropping as my death screen shows his Mossy. I push against his Hellfire Rocket Pods. I want to please Daddy. He uses his Mossy horn as he fills my Killboard with his name. LazyTR walks in, Daddy looks him straight in the eyes and says ""It's all MLG now."" Daddy leaves through the warpgate shield bubble. Daddy is love. Daddy is life."

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,ValorousBob,32,Tue Jul 14 23:40:55 2015 UTC,In my experience it's because the VS are notorious for dropping shitloads of people on fights or ghostcapping with 96+.  Not saying that the NC or TR don't do it but VS get called out a lot more for it and people form opinions on what they hear.
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Twiggeh1,5,Wed Jul 15 00:18:50 2015 UTC,Not saying that the NC or TR don't do it but VS get called out a lot more for it and people form opinions on what they hear.

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Twiggeh1,2,Wed Jul 15 13:56:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah basically.   Blame DIG and at one point KOTV. VS have the best faction wide coordination because the entire faction is only a few big outfits. NC have quite a few decent outfits that are pretty small which makes it harder to manage the big picture. TR like, 3 outfits that try and that's about it"
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,viveldop,4,Wed Jul 15 17:34:26 2015 UTC,"To me this isn't a valid point , just bring people to fight them and repel them.  That behaviour leads to unbelievable territory losses like West Pass Watchtower , or Granite Valley or a Bio Lab.  And you may not give a shit cuz its happening at 11 am , but guess wich faction 's scrubs are gonna get farmed THE WHOLE DAY becuz some dumb shitter leader thinks ""only NC gives good fights"".  Sometimes this behaviour leads to some retarded decisions when you guys don't think about what's hapening later.  And you are breaking the whole dynamic of the alerts which could be far more enjoyable for THE WHOLE SERVER.  But no , ""NC gives better fights"".... AGNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Twiggeh1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:12:32 2015 UTC,"While I agree in principle, it's easy to say 'just bring more people' but it's another to do it. Solo players and small outfits won't have the firepower to make a difference without help and not all of them coordinate with others on the continent.   Unless you have a leader who is willing to pick the hard fights and players who are willing to go to them then you won't stop the zerg, and if you do it won't take long for them to redeploy to another lane and start again.   Most big zergs want the easy fights and tend to avoid other zergs, because winning territory is more important to them than having a fun fight. Then you have the opposite extreme which is the people who don't care about territory and simply want fun fights.   You can't force people to enjoy a certain way of playing sadly, faction wide coordination is tough to achieve because everyone has different styles and interests within the game."

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,FlagVC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:36:26 2015 UTC,"Anywhere from 3-4 to a full platoon.  However, it's not rare for the different squads, which tends to be different outfits to go off to do their own thing, either different bases or different continents. It does serve as a quick and easy communication chat for the squads, so they can easily communicate as needed."
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,NoDaddyNotTheCupbrd,21,Thu Jul 16 21:37:23 2015 UTC,"You drop your organized platoon of good players in an empty base and lock the place down by putting cheese sunderers at every chokepoint and on the control point, entrenched to a degree that it would take at least twice your numbers to even come close to removing you.  Why on earth would people other than a handful of inexperienced players who don't know any better show up to be farmed in a pre-planned meatgrinder?  I'm not trying to be a dick or insult you, but specific to you guys, it isn't a case of avoiding the VS but avoiding a pre-meditated, easily avoidable, one sided farm.  what you do is very effective, but understand it is cheesey as fuck and not in any way enjoyable to deal with, when the only two options are to be farmed or to zerg hard in order to counter your ""science"".  You would have a lot more success finding the farms you crave if you did it as NC/TR, I think the VS would be a lot more open to dropping 96+ people on your science projects and everyone will have Fury auraxiums in no time."

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,zerobite,15,Wed Jul 15 13:59:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it has nothing to do with liking a challenge, dislodging a stacked, entrenched, organised platoon with 2 cheese sundys at every chokepoint without heavy zerging is not a challenge, it is impossible, so anyone with half a clue doesn't bother.  The truth of the matter is either inexperienced randoms and lone wolves show up to trickle into your cheese zone of death and be instagibbed until the cap completes or a huge organized zerg drops on your head, overwhelms you with numbers and you complain about zergs.  How are either of these scenarios fun? Sure your guys get a bit of an ego stroke with a 20k/d from spamming furys at a doorway or you all get to pat each other on the back for forcing all the ""shitters"" to zerg you, but in what world could either of these be considered a good fight?  When you do what you do, people have 3 options, feed your meat grinder, zerg the shit out of you or ignore you and find a good fight. Why are you surprised people are choosing the least shitty option?  Like I said, I honestly am not having a go at what you do, if you enjoy it, good luck to you, but being ignored or being zerged are the only sensible responses to your cheesy science.  I'm sure it would be nice if a pub platoon showed up every time to be dunked on until the cap goes through, but most people have enough sense to not bang their head against a brick wall."
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Jhonnyqt,6,Wed Jul 15 14:31:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it has nothing to do with liking a challenge, dislodging a stacked, entrenched, organised platoon with 2 cheese sundys at every chokepoint without heavy zerging is not a challenge, it is impossible, so anyone with half a clue doesn't bother.   Ok first of all, that's a vast exaggeration of the forces that I/Desspa/Norington/Shamrock/etc have at our disposal when we form the Voltron Platoon. Usually we have about two squads of people and one or two battle sundies. It's absolutely not impossible to push us off a point once we're all set up, it's just that no one besides MCY, INI, or RO tries particularly hard.   How are either of these scenarios fun? Sure your guys get a bit of an ego stroke with a 20k/d from spamming furys at a doorway or you all get to pat each other on the back for forcing all the ""shitters"" to zerg you, but in what world could either of these be considered a good fight?   What I find fun is setting a challenging goal and then working to achieve it. Similarly, a good fight is one that is challenging for both sides. When we set up a Tech Plant hold and try to fight off vastly superior numbers, I have more fun then I've ever had in a videogame, even if we eventually fail. That, to me at least, is a great fight because the stakes are high for both sides, the winner is determined largely by skill, and both sides have a chance to win if they use tactics/coordination.  EDIT: Thank you for the response though, I really appreciate getting your perspective."

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Definia,8,Wed Jul 15 13:40:09 2015 UTC,"I don't totally avoid the VS front, but it's almost always less fun to fight VS, because:   DIG/KOTV. Particularly in an alert, you will get dropped on by a platoon of overpop if you're trying to take a lane and you're not zerging hugely yourselves. Prorion/Betelgeuse farmers. Hopefully removing 0.75 will encourage these players to not all use a single OP weapon on one faction. Particularly relevant to you, ~science~ means there's no point at all attacking a base if you've been in it. Magriders, PPA scythes and VS infantry weapons in general are more annoying to fight than TR equivalents (apart from pounders) VS blend into the terrain or the night sky"
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,FlagVC,4,Wed Jul 15 21:28:52 2015 UTC,Prorion/Betelgeuse farmers. Hopefully removing 0.75 will encourage these players to not all use a single OP weapon on one faction.   No they will continue to use Orion because it is gonna have accuracy like an AR.

They're either butthurt that you're saying the Orion changes are bad, or the Milluminati are trying to hide the fact that DBG are about to give the VS an LMG that hits with Orion DPS and Terminus accuracy. I would easily trade my .75x ADS for dat sweet, sweet accuracy."

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Killahs007,8,Thu Jul 16 15:17:28 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah, I like fighting VS (DIG/KOTV). When me and my boys are getting kicked badly by an 80% zerg we fall back to the previous base, set up a possible AA/AV nest and bombard em as best as we can. Sure, we end up losing due to less than a squad, but we accomplish a lot more than could be required from a handful of soldiers against a zerg. For most of us; when we manage to hold out for a certain length of time, there is some sense of accomplishment , and reward in the end.   I as a squad leader have learned one or two things when fighting against  extreme odds."
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,iHirvi,3,Wed Jul 15 21:41:11 2015 UTC,"When me and my boys are getting kicked badly by an 80% zerg we fall back to the previous base, set up a possible AA/AV nest and bombard em as best as we can   This can be fun for short periods, I agree. When they galaxy over your heads and flip A anyway, though, it feels a bit futile."
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,stoneshank,2,Thu Jul 16 17:37:45 2015 UTC,"Of course it is! We do lose in the end up. Less than a squad of our guys cant have a hope in the world of saving a base. But I'm of the belief that, the 20% TR in the base (who are made up of competent players, and that are under proper command) can make a good defense against a zerg; probably stall them for a good amount of time. This is very true for continents with a lot of open ground to cover."
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Eglaerinion,4,Thu Jul 16 21:04:14 2015 UTC,"Fuck yeah man! You sound like the VS Miller squad leaders of two years ago, except now we aren't at a huge pop advantage so our tactics are even more disgustingly effective. If more TR had your attitude you guys wouldn't get assfucked so often."
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,fredrikpedersen,2,Thu Jul 16 01:58:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks Bob, maybe its true, times of good public platoon leaders are gone, for the TR side anyways.

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Conchubair,17,Thu Jul 16 09:23:37 2015 UTC,"We drop on a base, flip the point and lock the base down. After a minute or two the VS pop is >75% and every third player is a MAX. GG. It has been like this since Woodman and Summer 2013. Back then it was K0TV, now it's DIG. And a lot of the DIG guys seem to be really proud of it.  NC does this only in their Ops nights. I think we still fight VS and NC equally but the situation is just what it is.  Edit: this and this might be relevant"
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Tov3rNaaR,7,Wed Jul 15 05:54:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I was frustrated yesterday because I had atleast 4 really really good infantry fights (no vehicle farmers, 50-50 and yell chat was dead due to the fun fights) completely annihilated by DIG drops (no diss on DIG in particular, but they were the ones that came) to turn it 75-25 and things went blank.  No alerts on those fights and the guys dropping moved away to another fight leaving, the previously great, fight desolate and NC had allready redeployed somewhere else (read: to somewhere they were protected by their own zerg).   edit: [ELME]stoneshank <- wuhuu! long time. That particular day was when TR started a 2-3 month period of really fightning VS (read: kotv) on woodman. Great times!  Not pointing fingers at any outfit or claiming only VS zergs. But it was really getting on my nerves yesterday."
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,0Megatron0,2,Wed Jul 15 13:27:19 2015 UTC,"Yesterday evening. 10-15 minutes before the Esamir alert, so even less reason at all to overpop a fight. We had a semi public platoon with about 3 squads fighting for Esamir Munitions Corp (Mattherson's Triumph). Turned into a 50/50 fight where we controlled B and C, with 4 minutes remaining. Hard enough for us as is.   Suddenly two or three galaxy drops with at least 8 maxes right on top of us. Three guesses which faction we were fighting and what outfit dropped on us for no apparent reason but to kill a nice fight.  I know we are probably guilty of occasionally doing the same thing but if it happens all the time when fighting one faction yeah you go and fight the one that doesn't end fights the moment they get interesting."

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Br4gi,10,Wed Jul 15 10:59:38 2015 UTC,"From my perspective the VS bring overpopping all purpose zergs that suffocate fights.   If we do manage to stop those zergs you deploy away or bring a massive ball of air before leaving again.  Those aren't fun to fight against unless you have your own coordinated response. But when we do bring a strong team you don't.  For instance; Sunday nights, the NC coordinates and where are the VS to oppose us? Or what about that time we teabaged your warpgate with a few coordinated outfits?  In contrast fights on NC TR lanes are generally more fluid and less 'all or nothing'."

Vs love to Ptfo far more than other factions and seem to love sitting around watching the cap timer go down than other factions.

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,1NieMamPomyslu1,23,Wed Jul 15 10:01:51 2015 UTC,"Listen Bob.   It's the Vanu that are 'avoiding the fight'.   I don't mind a decent enemy overpop ...they make better fights. So I'll take 35 - 40% TR pop and like it a lot. It's when you systematically get outpopped by Scythes (and sometimes Reavers as well.. yesterday on Amerish we were outpopped by 85% by NC a few times) and Gals alone in the hex AND you have to deal with 60+% overpop on foot, where it stops being ""a fight"".   If all you want out of your evening of enjoyment is ""gaining territory"" and calling that ""a fight""...well.. then more power to you, I guess. By all means... bring 6 scythes, 3 Libs & 3 battle Gals + a full platoon (and whatever randoms also go there) to 12 people waiting around cap-point for 'a fight'.   Sure, you'll win the territory, but you've deprived both yourself and your enemy of 'a fight'."

I can more or less reliably 1v1 a TR or NC heavy (depending on which alt I am playing) but fighting with VS is just huge pain in the arse. 90% of your pop are heavies warping all over the place, killing me without even aiming in my general direction etc. Planetside netcode just can't support this bullshit. DIG. Yeah, I will for sure go fight VS when I can be certain they just redeploy 2 platoons worth of MAXes regardless of how big force we used to attack. FOG and other lagwizards. This is an compliment to point one. It's impossible to fight them because when you see them, you are already dead on their screen. Cheesiness and Shittery. Scythe swarm (all killing you with 0 COF PPA from outside lockon range). Lashers (I am not, by any means, saying it's OP, it's just incredibly frustrating to fight against). HE magriders on every hill around (they are more frustrating than Prowlers/Vanguards because they can get in more places).    I see your edit with ""NotAllVanu"" hashtag, but it's not true.

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Conchubair,2,Thu Jul 16 09:15:56 2015 UTC,"Most other 0.75ADS weaponry are non-heavy, so they not as annoying as balanced as fck* Orion an SVA-88. NS-15m, because of small DPS is not a problem. I do think that cyclone heavy is also complete BS and removing access to SMG's for Heavy Assalut is not a idea. Also, Orion has similiar DPS to Cyclone, 2 or even 3 times better performance at range, and 25 more rounds in a mag (15 when cyclone user have extended mags, but then you are giving up foregrip)."
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,1NieMamPomyslu1,2,Thu Jul 16 10:50:43 2015 UTC,"Im not talking about dps or anything, its the warping im talking about. Why do orions warp, but not jaguars, bandits, tar/hv45s etc? YOU EVEN SAY THAT THE NS15M IS OK, YET ORIONS WARP, like wtf? And also, if .75ADS makes people warp, what about the people you hipfire you? they must be even worse. Cyclone. DPS might look similar on paper, but the cyclone allows for actually applying that DPS more. Its recoil is laughably easy to compensate for, and there is no need to use a foregrip on it. Its also got way better starting cone of fire than the current orion. It also has a short reload of 1.8 seconds and a long reload that is faster than the short reload of the orion. It also has the ability to ADAD hipfire strafe, which surely must cause far worse warping? Yeah, it sucks at range, but in this game you can choose your engagements very easily to avoid those situations   your problem is that you prolly are a dickshooter who cannot track very well, and b/c of that blames loosing to people 1v1 on the game. Me? im going to love the orion ""nerfs"" when i can kill people like you even more easily."

I see your accuracy and HSR, they are nice, but maybe, just maybe farming over and over are not things people enjoy doing.    And that's relevant why?   It was in reply to your stats, you decided they are good thing to use in this argument. I mean, if farming scrubs is giving you fun, okay, but why call anyone who find that boring a ""dickshooter"".

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,FlagVC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:17:22 2015 UTC,"In very specific ranges, yes, Cyclone wrecks everything, but if you stand further away than 20m, Cyclone's recoil makes it really hard to go for consistent headshots. It is OP on heavy tho, but the main difference between it and Orion is amount of them on the battlefield. When fighting VS, EVERY SINGLE heavy will be using Orion/Beetlejuice or SVA-88, maybe except for some poor 20BR who got Pulsar in the newbie pack before they removed it. When fighting NC, you need to avoid very specific engagement ranges (I'd say 10-20m) and even in those, only some part of NC heavies will be using it. I don't have very much experience with Orion (I was trying to play VS, but for some reason I just couldn't stand it, Orion itself was awesome, but all the fights was either huge DIG zergs or 1-12 with one enemy stalker as only enemy in the area.) so I can't really say which one is better, but I have far more problems when fighting Orion VS than Cyclone NC."

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,StriKejk,9,Wed Jul 15 22:02:10 2015 UTC,"Showing up with massive numbers, ending a fight, and then fucking off to another lane is just boring.   One word, DIG."
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,SevenSixVS,3,Wed Jul 15 01:05:15 2015 UTC,I TK/harass/yell at them when they do it so don't expect to use DIG against me.
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,z3anogoNC,9,Wed Jul 15 01:44:37 2015 UTC,"I am not using it against you, I am giving you the answer to your question. The reason they do this is the expectation that DIG will do the same. So they send forces to match, plus additional forces to cover the expected DIGlets (but of course they don't come, because that would make a for a balanced fight which they activity avoid). For all non-farmers, fighting VS has de-evolved into zerg or be zerged. I could go into more detail with why, how etc. But honestly, its wasted breath on something that isn't going to change. There is a basic set of scenarios when facing VS, and all revolve around DIG. So back to my original answer. One word, DIG. That is why."
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,ScienceGaveMeAHadron,6,Wed Jul 15 02:09:00 2015 UTC,"So if DIG zergs a base, it's DIGs fault that no one comes to its defense. And if others overpop a base, it's also DIGs fault for not coming to defend that base?"

And we just let VS get on with it. Capture all out Tech Plants if you like. It still gives us a balanced fight as both NC and TR are denied MBT equally.

There was sometimes 1 A2G ESF near the tower, 0 HE tanks, ONE lonely Furybus that died quickly and only a few MAXes, but not a single Pounder one. VS also only had 2 or 3 MAXes. Despite having Hossin."

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,qwedfgh,5,Wed Jul 15 10:18:01 2015 UTC,"In my experience it's because when there is a 50/50 fight between TR/VS and VS is not winning they pull PPA-Scythes, Magriders and MAX'es - lot's of Maxes. Even when they have 60/40 pop they do it and ruin any fight there is until everybody is fed up getting farmed by force multipliers and redeploys."

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Drudid,8,Wed Jul 15 15:34:47 2015 UTC,"If the maps were back to the hex system instead of this lattice bullshit, it wouldn't be a problem.  There aren't enough lanes to fight on and VS are very good at grouping up on one lane and leaving the others empty.   So I look at the map...   Do I want a small ghost cap, or do I want to smash my head on a zerg?   OR do I go to the 50/50 48+ NC fight over there?  Easy choice."
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,fredrikpedersen,7,Wed Jul 15 08:06:51 2015 UTC,"I don't see why everyone has rose tinted glasses about the hex system.  Hex system had exactly the same issues reversed, people would actively avoid fights and ghost cap around enemies, any base that would cause a fight was avoided. It was fucking awful.  The problems are far more fundamental and are related to the changes in Planetside 2 from Planetside 1. It's far too logistically easy to move people across lattice lanes. In PS1 a dumb zerg pushing one lane could be crippled by smaller more elite units pushing other lanes, defending bases (a smaller elite unit was much stronger due to the nature of the cert system), destroying logistics  (tech plant generators meant NO ADVANCED VEHICLES, not just MBT's the enemies couldn't pull Sunderers, Libs, Reavers etc, it really fucked you up, draining bases. There were a lot of tools for you to use.  The other issue with PS2 is that attacking is far too easy. In PS1 if you attacked a base for the vast majority of them you had to hold the control console (basically the point) for 15 minutes. If the defenders managed to resecure it at 14 minutes 59 seconds you would have to rehack and hold it for another 15 minutes. In PS2 if you defend a 7 minute base at 6 mins 59 seconds you have to sit there and hold it for that time and the enemies are free to bring in reinforcements etc.  There's a lot more broken than people think."
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Alaea,2,Wed Jul 15 10:37:28 2015 UTC,"Hex wasn't perfect, but I preferred it for the freedom of choice we had.  Imagine being on the West side of Amerish during an alert and having the freedom to choose to go around West Pass Watchtower instead of through it. Too many times I've seen people sat for the entire 2 hours on that one base because the defenders were happy enough being camped up farming and protecting that lane with it.  Lattice makes base design far too important."

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Mauti404,2,Wed Jul 15 11:39:30 2015 UTC,"VS are very good at grouping up on one lane and leaving the others empty   Thats because most of Miller VS are in one outfit - [DIG]. Off cource, they more organised than TR or NC randoms, and easilly can overpop any hex they need.  Well, Im voted for lane system when it surfaced in the roadmap - because Im bored as Hell to play in hide and seek game aganist random infiltrators on Flashes around border hexes.  But now, when, finally, we got one huge outfit that represent most part of players of one faction, I thinking its not a bad idea to return back old hexes system - just because [DIG] cant be everywhere in that case :)  [DIG] can arrive too late to being capped hex with new redeploy system, but this is not what we need.  BTW, about Miller TR outfits leadership: main problem are not lack of coordination. Main problem are idiots, that cap hexes in the center of map, while ignoring hexes on the corners of map, even near TR warpgate. Im sick of this."

Main difference with Miller VS now - we dont have one leader for whole faction. We have one in the past - Ostekake, but he quit. No one want to do his job, seems like. Just because its not game, but job - to unite all TR outfits in one coordinated force.  Kamitor tried, but he are not PS1 veteran, and dont have so much experience.  Also, we have many new TR ""leaders"", who maybe not just dont have understanding in leadership, but dont even bother to look at map. Others dont care about territory, but about frags and certs farming - as you see in this reddit thread. Thats most common problem for todays Miller TR actions on global map.  Even basic knowledge or, atleast, small reason to not be warpgated, will not allow any Platoon/Squad leader to cap hexes at the map center, between two enemy factions in the middle of alert."

Yeah I know you guys have less people, but you both share some similar bad habits. I used to see a lot of GOON gal drops to assassinate sunderers for example.

We come together to work to achieve goals with each other, not hang around in teamspeak chatting whilst being in the same general area of the map. Besides, competetive fights on bases are seldom defensible for long with 3 squads of people PLUS whatever friendlies are already there, and then whoever makes their way over. Small 1 - 2 squad ones I can see sustaining themselves longer, throw 3+ in there and you risk making a honeypot fight, drawing in pop from all over until one side gets to the point that they crush the other (see fighting Vanu and DIG turns up)."
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,kodjeikov,3,Wed Jul 15 07:57:14 2015 UTC,"All the interest and the tension of teamplay come from the fight around bases. I can enjoy a good hill fight with no purpose if i'm alone, but what's the point if you are investing time and energy into teaming up ? You want dynamic fight with challenge. Most of the time my team is avoiding alerts in prime time because it's only à question of mass. I can understand it can be entertaining to manage an alert with two platoons. But most of players, and espacially small/mid size outfit like mine don't.   To answer the post, no we dont avoid vs. But we dont really like being shut-down by air squad and a ground platoon everytime we are trying to get involve into a simili-fair fight.  It's the way the game is supposed to be played. But it's not the gameplay we find entertaining.  About killing sundy during a good fight, it's all about what you stated as a good fight.

For example, ORBS was taking Nott Comm yesterday with a MAX horde, but it was still a decently fun fight so we left their sundies alive. When they took the base we gave them a ""gf"" in /yell chat and moved on.

We'll drop on an equal fight and kill the sundies because we want to start a capture on the next base. Or because a good 1/3 to 1/2 of the friendlies in a base are sat outside in tanks and can for all intents and purposes be ignored for the purpose of friendly population - they're not holding the points or helping to hold them so in our eyes, that base could effectively be underpopped."

However as soon as the VS backcapped Auraxicom Substation the population changed. It went from 55/45 in favour of VS into 60/40 later on to 80/20. In yellchat the VS were true heroes stating that the TR sucks and cant defend points.  Personally that grinds my gear, if they took the point after a decent fight i enjoy it, but losing a base against 80% VS pop and the yellchat is to much.

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Falchun,2,Wed Jul 15 10:38:00 2015 UTC,It might have helped yes:P
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Imrkil,3,Wed Jul 15 10:51:56 2015 UTC,i myself try and avoid VS fights as i dont like the sudden 2-4 squad drops on a small fight and then run into 1-2 squads of max crash.  nothing fun in having a somewhat 50/50 or even 40/60 fight turn into a 20/80 from VS dropping a zerg on it.
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,DeadyWalking,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:54:32 2015 UTC,"Not a faction I avoid, but the zerg.  Fighting the zerg is not fun.  I prefer fighting alone against 2-4 enemies over a base and taking it away from them.  Fighting 48 people at a base alone, when 36 of them are camping the spawnroom against me alone, while feeling honored that you are so afraid of me, I'm not feeling fun.  Since VS do not even know anymore what a non-zerg-fight looks like, I basically only fight VS in the middle of the night in small 1v2-4 ghostcap scenarios.  Most annoying of all ofc is when NC and TR have a really, really good fight going and VS turn up to ruin it.  (We had an epic back-and-forth between Mulac Foundry and Nettlemire Gardens 2 or 3 days ago, when suddenly this VoGu Battlegal turns up and destroys the fun for both sides by Bulldoging everyone into the ground. It went from a raging Tank/MAX/Infantry melee to empty space within 3 minutes basically and everyone just left the lane.)  (Or even shittier... about a week ago in the middle of the night. 52% NC pop on Amerish, TR warpgated with 17% pop, so 31% VS pop, I bring a Sunderer out west of our Warpgate to take a base away from NC. The second my Sunderer is up, 5 (!) VS Scythes turn up and destroy it. At a base directly at the TR warpgate which is being zerged by 52% NC population... sorry but with such shitter moves it's totally clear that nobody wants to fight any VS anymore.)"
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Alvahryn,7,Wed Jul 15 00:20:03 2015 UTC,"I prefer fighting alone against 2-4 enemies over a base and taking it away from them.   Why do you even play Planetside? Even better question, why am I bothering to respond to a Badzino post?   Since VS do not even know anymore what a non-zerg-fight looks like, I basically only fight VS in the middle of the night in small 1v2-4 ghostcap scenarios.   Really?  Are you sure??   Most annoying of all ofc is when NC and TR have a really, really good fight going and VS turn up to ruin it.   It's called ATRA, and it's real.

MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,DeadyWalking,7,Wed Jul 15 01:34:57 2015 UTC,Why do you even play Planetside?    And this is what more and more people are asking from themselves.
MillerPlanetside,3dbfle,Definia,2,Wed Jul 15 06:24:46 2015 UTC,"That was a really nice fight. It took a great deal of effort to break through that point defense.   So here's question now: are you calling the TR bad because it took so many people to save the tech plant, during an alert? Because I'm certain there's a big difference in having people come at you in greater and greater numbers because they simply can't remove you and your ilk, versus having the same amount of people suddenly balooning on a base and wiping everything out."
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,kodjeikov,8,Tue Jul 14 21:57:21 2015 UTC,I'm assuming this is sarcastic given that TR spent that whole alert pushing Mani (NC) when VS had >50% territory control.
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,Astriania,2,Tue Jul 14 22:46:32 2015 UTC,"They were blocked at Andvari and Matterson, The NCs had far more easy lanes to take."
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,sighpolice,2,Tue Jul 14 23:10:33 2015 UTC,They were blocked at Mani too.
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,ValorousBob,0,Tue Jul 14 23:23:53 2015 UTC,"So, it's your failure to push the outposts, or their failure to take a biobal to the NC max ?  hmmmm.... i don't know...."
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,bpostal,4,Wed Jul 15 10:31:59 2015 UTC,"lol every time they tried to attack Andvari I just flew my Scythe in through the south entrance and started PPA farming. Since I've never seen anyone fly a Reaver around the inside of a bio lab, I'm guessing the TR weighed their options and decided fighting you guys would be more productive...  EDIT: A mossy almost got caught me once but I managed to slip inside before he could kill me, then I got a /tell from Huller saying nothing but ""HAX"" lolololol"
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,LimetteOriginal,2,Tue Jul 14 23:24:39 2015 UTC,"""HAX""    You and your fuckin science!"
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,Sekaszy,5,Wed Jul 15 05:09:23 2015 UTC,"alert starts ""hmm, might aswell play this""  50% control by VS  Only way to fight VS is in a biolab  ""Fck this, imma go back to amerish""  Afterall i had fun during this alert"
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,LimetteOriginal,2,Tue Jul 14 23:19:42 2015 UTC,"One alert before  Indar   TR control like 70%  VS and NC get they shit togeder dont act like retards and fuck TR up.  Its dosent matter how % of continent looks like when alerts starts, just go for it.  JUST DO IT!"
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,Towerful,2,Wed Jul 15 12:10:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah but this time TR and NC did not get their shit together, instead TR zerged NC in the north, while getting outpopped by VS in the south.  Nope   Nope  Nope"
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,Astriania,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:05:50 2015 UTC,"There was one point that the TR attacked the VS, and did some good.  NC managed to get some territory off the VS.  Then the NC went for the tech plant. which was a rather stupid decision. It meant the VS redeployed to the tech plant. Which meant the TR had no reason to fight the VS. So they went back to mani with about 2 platoons. Which meant the NC had to redeploy to mani. Which meant, once the VS kick NC out of the tech plant, they rampaged through our middle.  it was horrible to watch unfold"
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,ValorousBob,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:53:12 2015 UTC,It meant the VS redeployed to the tech plant. Which meant the TR had no reason to fight the VS.   TR could have used that moment to break the VS at Andvari or EMC instead of attacking Mani.
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,AmitGr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:23:42 2015 UTC,That south warpgate is kinda OP tbh.
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,SevenSixVS,2,Tue Jul 14 23:26:50 2015 UTC,"Esamir is kinda broken when it comes to alert, if some faction has 2 biolabs (especially if one of them is Ymir) at the beginning of the alert, and this faction is not completely retarded, they already have all the cards to the win, having them two strong hold points in the flanks, and can focus relatively safely in the middle.  All praise latice."
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,Alvahryn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:06:53 2015 UTC,"Generally all four continents are designed like this with Hossin being the possible exception, as the lattice seems slightly more flexible in terms of creating openings to other lanes and there are generally less fucking tower bases with the A point directly beneath the spawn. =)"
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,Eglaerinion,2,Wed Jul 15 15:56:00 2015 UTC,EDIT: sarcasm was successfully detected   I was wondering ... because all I heard was command channel talking about capping Heyoka ... which is on Amerish while the alert was on Esamir ^ ^
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,Fluttyman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:26:05 2015 UTC,Quite funny hearing Stumpy in command asking for help on the techplant. What techplant is he fucking talking about? Ohh Amerish.

MillerPlanetside,3db1un,Yolo-TheSwagnificent,2,Tue Jul 14 22:10:42 2015 UTC,very well played by VS. We ended with nice 58% and I really enjoyed VS gameplay at this alert.
MillerPlanetside,3db1un,Maelstrome26,0,Tue Jul 14 22:38:22 2015 UTC,"Nah we didn't win it. We got trounced at the end and had by far the lowest pop.   Don't know why it needs congratulating though. Still needs some work, only on TR can you experience the 3 faction game."
MillerPlanetside,3d9zde,ninefingers79,34,Tue Jul 14 17:34:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm gonna go against the grain and call bullshit here.  The reason Sammy, like Robin, came out with a public apology is that his attention-seeking fuckery had reached its climax and it was no longer paying dividends (in terms of how many people were posting about him/recognized his existence). Upon reaching the logical conclusion of twattery (that is, without resorting to RL threats or other sorts of criminality) he realized that the one way he could squeeze out a few more drops of attention from the server was to have a drastic turnaround and attempt to absolve himself.  It's a pretty classic example of destructive, attention-seeking behavior escalating with its intended audience's desensitization to his bullshit, reaching its apex and then, eventually, repeating itself.  So once he's done playing the recovering shitlord and no longer receives attention from y'all for his miraculous salvation, he will once again return to his former frothiness, because that's the easiest way to feed his narcissism ad infinitum."
MillerPlanetside,3d9zde,TheScavenger101,8,Tue Jul 14 19:47:28 2015 UTC,"It does look like a ""Look how many people I pissed off"" - post doesn't it :P"
MillerPlanetside,3d9zde,dnaRIP,9,Tue Jul 14 21:40:17 2015 UTC,The reason for the apologies is that I required that of him in order to process his recruitment application into BRTD.  He did as requested and we will now see how it goes.
MillerPlanetside,3d9zde,Kn0ss,15,Tue Jul 14 20:25:00 2015 UTC,"The thing is, an apology forced, has no real meaning. I look forward to the impending shenanigans. Sammy,  you've played them well :-P"
MillerPlanetside,3d9zde,ninefingers79,6,Tue Jul 14 20:46:32 2015 UTC,"That's a gamble I wouldn't make, but for your and your outfit's sake I hope that I'm wrong!"
MillerPlanetside,3d9zde,duanor,3,Tue Jul 14 20:57:55 2015 UTC,Sammy is a good player and pilot can be used really well by BRTD as he once did when following my orders. If he gets the right mentalllity and attitude he can give a lot to the outfit and I hope it goes like this. My best wishes for both BRTD and Sammy :)
MillerPlanetside,3d9zde,Diedjies,2,Wed Jul 15 00:37:46 2015 UTC,"I see he apologised to me personally, but I don't hold any grudge. If he turns around his behaviour good for him, he deserves a chance."
MillerPlanetside,3d9zde,AmitGr,2,Wed Jul 15 10:19:38 2015 UTC,"He's already in the ignore list of half the server, so he had to find another way to reach them in order for them to remember what a douche he is."
MillerPlanetside,3d9zde,Kamitor,13,Wed Jul 15 07:02:04 2015 UTC,"Allthough I will remain highly skeptic, Knowing your behavoir in the past and having a similar expierance with Robin, I welcome anyone to play this game, including you SammyWillz.  I have more than one reason to really hate you to your guts, and you know it. You actually managed to make me reconsider helping homeless people in real life.   When you did what you did, to elme, I wanted to bann you, I choice not to, as ""what is the point"". Reciently you managed to stirr up your vices once more with the TS spam and the repeated tells.   Now you've joined BRTD; and Suddenly seen the light.  I remain skeptic as I did the same for you when you were in ELME and for a while Sammy, We liked you, welcomed you. People called you their hero for your cool stunts. And for a while, you didnt seem all too bad.   You said you'd seen the error of your ways and EXACTLY like this, you apologized to people.    The diffrence now is, its more public. We will see. You lasted a month in ELME, just enough to win the trust.  That is until you left, without notice, and then on the same day, Impersonated an outfitleader, took advantage from the good intentions of Duanor. Kicked almost all the good people in ELME.   Our damage, to elme, is still felt to this day, We lost two outfit leaders through you, and a lot of members that joined other outfits to go inactive afterwards.  This letter, you just wrote, might be the attention seeking desperate struggle of a person that has been abused in his earlier life or something. I hope not. I hope, that you shed your fears, shed your vices, before they become a part of you.   Remember, its all a joke. It's all a game But  ""Fake it until you become it""  Means: You will become how you ACT.    I commend, my fellow TR leader, DNArip for being generous enough, to stand by him.  I commend BRTD for trying to help this, clearly unstable person, that has been rejected server wide. I hope you will succeed, for it means another person enjoying this game.  If you fail, I doubt it will be because BRTD was to be the error, rather, the AttentionSpan of Sammy, turning off.   To sammy i will say, I Dare you to be what everyone in this server thinks you cannot be.  Maybe that will help you achieve having fun without disrupting, Destroying or intentionally ruening the fun of others."

MillerPlanetside,3d9zde,dnaRIP,15,Wed Jul 15 23:05:26 2015 UTC,Thank you Sammy for the apology. BRTD will now accept your application as a recruit. Good luck to you in the future.

MillerPlanetside,3d9zde,Neeelshrav,2,Wed Jul 15 00:44:01 2015 UTC,KOTV teamspeak squads are the best. You should ask Neeelshrav who one the dogfighting scrim on PTS. (It was me with an ns11c and a spitfire XD)
MillerPlanetside,3d9zde,phantom1942,2,Wed Jul 15 09:43:11 2015 UTC,I thought he was in the air; he pulled a flash and then put a spitfire down; to annoy the shit out of me. And then while looking for him; i had an unfortunate encounter with an extremely skillful tree.

Robin apologized as well, and he followed up by being a total asshat and got himself permabanned from the whole of Reddit.  Just think before you speak is the best advice I can give you, if you're going to type something out on Reddit, think to yourself ""Is that actually necessary to post?"" and think what others would see that as. You'll soon start posting more reasonable things and you'll see yourself where you've been going wrong.  Regarding Planetside, just play the game and don't rage tell people basically. Yell chat is fun but it has a time and a place, your team mates would prefer you gunning down a enemy than you telling them ""you suck balls gheylord"".  People won't forget and respect isn't served on a plate, so keep sensible."

I think by now you may have realized what an emotional drain this behavior can be - and how it can result in you becoming the ultimate cunt. It is not a unique story though: it is deeply intertwined with the distance between people nowadays - and the lack of need to conform to social rules. They are still there though, in any world real or virtual.  MACW was damaged severely before I finally kicked you out and that damage cannot be undone. I consider it a leadership failure from my side as well for allowing you to stay for 1 or 2 months after the first signals of bad conduct reached me. It's reputation was further tarnished by it, despite being a good outfit with people that really liked to play together. You didn't destroy it, but you did damage it.

If you want that, go play Q3 TDM (not CTF, cause that has a goal too), go play CoD TDM, or MoH TDM, or any deathmatch shooter.  But Planetside 2 has a completely different primary goal:  Taking territory.  That you have to shoot other players for that is an added bonus. That you get to use so many different tools for that, also an added bonus. But the goal of this game is to get to the control point and then defend the control point as in: around the control point.  I'm very sure it was never intended that the spawns get camped so hard. Cause in PS1, you could just destroy the spawntubes and end the enemy spawns. So the enemy actually had to do something to defend their base.  Here you can rarely destroy the spawntube, which might be a good idea probably.  In other games (like CoD) the spawn works a little better cause there is no room you can camp, but there is just a general area where the enemy can spawn inside anywhere. So spawncamping is not THAT possible unless one team (and CoD pretty much guarantees 50:50 fights) is SO much stronger that they push the enemy all the way back to the last capture point."

MillerPlanetside,3d90zj,Pitbooll,0,Tue Jul 14 17:38:09 2015 UTC,"In CS actually killing the enemy team will complete the objective, as in: win the round.  In PS2, you can farm poor souls running out of a spawnroom for hours with no objective effect if nobody is on the point flipping the base.  You can also farm the enemy who is trying to attack Subterran Nanite Analysis for hours. But the objective of the game would really be to push them out, kill off their Sunderers and move on to capture their next base in line.  I personally am totally okay with DBG banning people who sit in Subterran without trying to get out. OR banning people who sit outside not trying to get in, cause they can farm from outside as well (some people really believe that)."
MillerPlanetside,3d90zj,B4rr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:57:18 2015 UTC,"on CS-GO Deathmatch servers you can kill a full team that you dont win the round, its a farm competition.

Everyone who has been playing PS2 for a longer time would be able to see more than one reason why such an idea can be called being nothing but completely brainafk. The final decisions about kicking, suspending and/or banning needs to be handed over to some kinda ingame-mods like the ones the game originally had. If that's not possible due to the costs caused by the amount of workload then DBG should maybe think about some alternative solutions like choosing a group of older, well experienced and overall trustworthy players from each server to act as some kinda ""Severs High Council"" that will be given the authority of ""having the last word"" on such a kind of decisions.           - <Sn00p><{"

MillerPlanetside,3d6ih8,ValorousBob,12,Tue Jul 14 00:15:04 2015 UTC,"Aha...a clear case of Spit de la Turret syndrome:  Turret syndrome (also called Turret's syndrome, Turret's disorder, Spit de la Turret syndrome, STS or, more commonly, simply Turret's or TS) is an inherited nanitesychiatric disorder with onset in early spawning, characterized by multiple physical tics like non-burstfiring and at least one vocal (phonic) tic. These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed temporarily by the use of medkits, and are preceded by a premonitory urge. Turret's is defined as part of a spectrum of tic disorders, which includes provisional, transient and persistent (chronic) tics.  Characteristics:  When encountering a Spitfire Turret, common tics are movements or sounds ""that occur intermittently and unpredictably out of a background of normal motor activity"", having the appearance of ""normal behaviors gone wrong"". The tics associated with Spit de la Turret's change in number, frequency, severity and anatomical location. Waxing and waning—the ongoing increase and decrease in severity and frequency of tics—occurs differently in each individual & depends on the number of Spitfire Turrets present. Tics also occur in ""bouts of bouts"", which vary for each person.  Coprolalia (the spontaneous utterance of socially objectionable or taboo words or phrases after someone is killed by a Spitfire Turret) is the most publicized symptom of Turret's, but it is not required for a diagnosis of Turret's and yet about 99% of Turret's patients exhibit it.  Examples of Coprolalia are /yells like ""WHAT THE HIGBY"", ""R U HIGBY KIDDING ME"", ""RAAAGH, F#CK C&CKS&CK!NG ENGI!"" & ""CODY""  ;)"

MillerPlanetside,3d6tcu,PastalavistaBaybie,2,Tue Jul 14 10:22:30 2015 UTC,ಠ_ಠ  C4 is the only thing that makes this class viable
MillerPlanetside,3d6tcu,PastalavistaBaybie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:28:14 2015 UTC,It's broken. Either C4 has to be removed from LA or C4 has to be changed. Currently there's no counter to flight ceiling C4 drops and Jump pad + Drifter LA.
MillerPlanetside,3d6tcu,PhysicsManUK,2,Tue Jul 14 10:31:52 2015 UTC,"Why? Because you don't like having your anchored HE prowler destroyed? C4 should definitely remain on LA, it's one of the best traits of the class and a great counter to both Maxes and HE shellers."
MillerPlanetside,3d6tcu,PastalavistaBaybie,0,Tue Jul 14 11:14:50 2015 UTC,"That ""Anchored HE Prowler"" circlejerk argument is so old, that it doesn't hold any truth to it anymore. Especially HE and any kind of AI weapon has been nerfed into the ground, effectively removing it from the game. HE Tanks are a rare sight and only people that are trying to Auraxium it (which is near impossible to do now) are pulling them anymore. There's just no reason to do.  The Prowler as a whole is pretty shit without Anchor Mode and even with it, it can only survive as long as nobody is shooting at it. C4 drops and drifter LAs are especially dangerous to Prowlers and have no real counter. Not that I didn't kill dozens of Vanguards with Drifter LA + C4. (Magriders are pretty much immune to C4, Lightnings are not really worth it and Sunderers are the real Tanks in terms of durability.) It simply is not possible to spot and react to every single Infantry in a 800m radius (3D) without using ESP. Planetside 2 has basically become ""Attack fo the Titans"", with the differences that every 3D Maneuver gear using Soldier can come anywhere from 360 degrees and kill a Titan by himself and the whole body of the ""Titan"" is his weak spot.  From a balance standpoint and by using common sense, the only class that should have access to C4 is the Engineer who is supposed to be the explosives expert."
MillerPlanetside,3d6tcu,DizzyKnightTR,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:33:12 2015 UTC,Did you just say vehicles farming infantry is not a problem in this game?????
MillerPlanetside,3d6tcu,PastalavistaBaybie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:56:55 2015 UTC,"That ""problem"" has mostly been removed from the game through effectively removing farming tools by nerfing them in the ground. But Farmers still use the remaining ""cheese"" like ""Farmderers, Battle Gals, PPA Scythes and AH Reavers"". The Viper Lightning is viable to some extent.  You can't nerf ""bad"", so instead, DGC nerfed vehicles to the point where they have to flee from a single Infantry. Infantry/Max AV are brokenly OP atm and even though AA stacks very good, individually, it's useless. The Skyguard needs some serious buffs and the Tankbuster needs the Nerfhammer. Damage wise, Hornets are broken too. Rocket pods are pretty mediocre against Infantry after all the nerfs, but still can one clip a MBT. ESFs never should have gotten A2G weapons tbh. The separation of Reaver and Mosquito in Planetside 1 looks much better.

Spammers get 10 min or 1 day timeouts, not people who joke around. In total you gave me 6 10 min timeouts, 3 of wich were rightful since I posted a swastika, which is probably against the PSBtwitch rules and is understandable. (ANELE am hindi ANELE Kappa) But the 3 other ones? I came and asked you on ts and your responce was ""I'm really not in the mood to deal with your kind of behaviour."" That's some 1st class bullshit. You might find that we have to grow up, I get that.

I think the vehicle play lost you the game in the end, because when you swapped from NC to TR you didnt have Raven MAXes anymore, and weren't able to use your walkersundies unchallanged. They gained air superiority and utilized it well. Regardless of that, you did a pretty amazing job at saving Ziggurat so often, something I wasn't expecting having scrimmed MACS ourselves.  All in all, you had a very unlucky draw. Some teams got qualified without playing a single match, you guys had to play two very strong opponents.

In the interest of improving (It's still part of this post right?!), I would be very interested in hearing an outsiders perspective of MoX's performance and where we could improve.   We were operating as a 6 man team with the two mobile Walker busses plus MAXes, and aimed to shut down opposing air / spawns.   I think we definately had the easier role than 252v, and I also think we filled that role well in the 1st half. In the 2nd however we found ourselves resource starved and unable to fill our role as well as the 1st half.  Thanks in advance"
MillerPlanetside,3d21jk,BeastmanTR,5,Mon Jul 13 09:51:38 2015 UTC,I can't speak for MOX specifically because the camera didn't focus on you guys very much. However I can say that in general it's more efficient to control the air with actual aircraft then with AA. If your six man team had been 6 ESFs or maybe 4 ESFs and a shredder lib your whole team would have had sooooo much more firepower.
MillerPlanetside,3d21jk,StillMostlyClueless,5,Mon Jul 13 13:24:08 2015 UTC,"In general I would agree, however we have a total of 1 good pilot who can be relied upon to fly in a straight line without crashing, hence the Sunderers. Of course the downside to this as you mentioned is a reduction of firepower, however with the chances of winning air superiority in an A2A sence being pretty much nil we had to come up with something else.

MillerPlanetside,3d21jk,TheTacticalShrimp,7,Sun Jul 12 23:21:40 2015 UTC,"Well, they're leaders and I'm guessing their opinions reflect in their leadership.  A second issue other than downplaying individual skill is the mentality. You're saying you want to improve right? The first thing you'll have to do before anything else is to pop the bubble of ignorance and blame yourself for anything going wrong, even if it truly wasn't your fault. If you lose a 1v1 it's not ""WHERE'S MY COVER?"" it's ""I lost that, that was my fault. What can I do to improve?"".   https://youtu.be/5VQ5GVNZJAM?t=39m  That's a good example on how not to think. One guy says something delusional, some other guys join in and all of a sudden the bubble is reinforced and you end up not improving at all.  I asked the ORBS leader this but he refused to answer.  What are you doing to improve individual FPS skill?"
MillerPlanetside,3d21jk,CurryBeans,2,Sun Jul 12 23:25:35 2015 UTC,"We had a post in our forums recently titled ""How to maximize lethality as Infantry"", so I'm mostly following that. Here's a few of the videos it references that I'm trying to take onboard and do:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=u3b3m1F2N24 - Checking your angles without leaving yourself exposed.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=yeletlnJObk - Pre-aiming, lining up the shot before you need to take it. That helped :P  I'm also checking my loadouts to make sure they compliment the way I play and if they don't, what I need to do to change. We're trying to start up 1v1s on PTS between members, I need to improve on that quite badly especially if I'm a medic or engi vs a heavy, cuz I figure if you can beat them as those classes, you can hump them as an heavy.  I was one of the members in that video raging by the way, I was really salty at the time who said ""well that was bullshit"" because we just got outspammed by MAXes, but their engis were repairing their maxes and their medics were healing them.   Ultimately we needed to take out the medics & engis before focusing on the MAXes and we didn't do that, we were also starved of resources because we wasted grenade nanites which is something we were really conscious of this match just played.  You're right though, hearing it back I see where you're coming from and it's really bad way to think."
MillerPlanetside,3d21jk,Definia,9,Sun Jul 12 23:33:00 2015 UTC,"I'll put on my ""constructive criticism"" hat on then.   You didn't get beat by maxes. You got beat in a biolab because you literally did every single thing wrong you can do as a squad/platoon in a biolab.  No one EVER used jungle, when you were attacking or defending. (Biolab 101. Jungle is crucial, it holds the flank and forces your enemy down middle or to A)   Your squad cohesion was whack out of order because Orders were never followed properly and You always came trickling out of the spawn in a line and not a blob just straight to SCU then Gen Building and got torn a part because of it.  Another thing, in a biolab with ""max spam"" your heavies had concs and hawks, not AV nades and Deci's. Well at least the one POV i watched did anyway.  Your own maxes charged rooms that had full VS squads in it and no back up near him, complete waste of resources.  All from the DORA match(Just the biolab) and all I can really think of right now off the top of my head.  ETA: ""Elitists hurdur"" want outfits to improve, before the briggs smash there was a lot of shitposting from all sides against ""elite"" outfits. Some really retarded shit was said, these things bite you (i don't specifically mean you) in the ass. And you can't tell me that if we had lost that Briggs smash then the ""casuals"" wouldn't be circle jerking what we said. Just the way it is."
MillerPlanetside,3d21jk,Maelstrome26,3,Sun Jul 12 23:47:07 2015 UTC,"Here's some 12 man attempt at attacking some Bio Lab that we knew was going to get redeployed heavily but whatever (an old video from Dec 2014, I don't record so this is all I have for you - not OPS or anything like that, just some daily fucking around). Was testing the TMG 50 but that's not the point - just watch how your people are supposed to position even with such small numbers (with higher numbers you can't ever break out of that unless everyone fails hard @ jungle and you get galaxy dropped from the pads / teleporter). So far the only outfit that has ever done that are MCY since we both use that same tactic which is super effective. Don't try to break from the spawn rooms, etc.  As for those other links above - crosshair placement in the middle of the screen is indeed why people think other people are cheaters. You save enough time with that crosshair placement to turn it into an advantage in 1v1. It's very crucial for games like CS and is definitely useful in PS2.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIhPIHg4WuU"

Criticism can come in many ways though, and you have to be able to take it regardless of how brutal it can be. I mean i'm gonna come out and tell you an example and how you take it and act on it is gonna be up to you.  In that Dora match and watching the POV with your comms, people in your outfit and other outfits (generally the ones that seem to be on the otherside of ""elitist"" arguments on squadplay etc) say that communication etc is extremely key and above all other aspects. Which yea it is key, but from watching the DORA match (more specifically again the biolab) your comms were not very good, and there are others who will agree with me. (maybe even yourself)"

The biolab was very much where it all fell apart for us and we know that, we didn't organize ourselves and we couldn't deal with their MAXes, they simply co-ordinated better than us and there was plenty of fault in ourselves that we saw afterwards.  Our post-match postmortems aren't full of ""they were just lucky"", they're probably harsher than what people say on here in fact :( but it's worth telling somebody what they did wrong so they don't do it again."

We have extremely good players and they do help to train up others. What our ops nights are for is to improve how well those players perform in a squad. Squad play is always the focus on those nights, individual fps play is something else. Any player will always look to blame something else other than themselves.   Edit: this is probably more aggressive then I intended. Sorry about that. But the point is still there.

My opinion can be summarized as ""We didn't lose matches because of lack of individual skill and individual skill does not always correlate to better ServerSmash performance. We should focus on improving our strategy and tactics instead of our individual skill. Other servers win with worse outfits."""
MillerPlanetside,3d21jk,Havetts,11,Mon Jul 13 08:45:04 2015 UTC,"My opinion can be summarized as   My responce can be summarized as ""you are wrong""   ""We didn't lose matches because of lack of individual skill...   Wrong. We did. And lot's too. It surprises me that -even in the face of evidence- you still say this. In everything you do (everything) 'individual skill' is a big factor and more often then not, it's the fundament of building a good team, that while using a good overall plan beats an opponent or overcomes a challenge / opposition.   ...and individual skill does not always correlate to better ServerSmash performance.    Wrong. The better the individual players were and the larger their numbers, the better the result. Ever beat Briggs before the last match? There is a direct correlation between winning and the skill-difference between your opponent. Look at soccer, FPS games, rugby, chess.    We should focus on improving our strategy and tactics instead of our individual skill.    Wrong. You only need a handfull SKILLED (there we go again) tacticians who can read the map in an instant. We don't need to 'hone that skill' as a large group though, since like I said we only need a few that are ace at this and we already have those: Fara, Shrikkety, Rtiger, Desspa, Napoleon. Sure, they can improve a little...there's always room for that, but that's not where our true gain lies.  Our true gain is found in individual skill. For two reasons;    there's just more people playing that have to rely on said 'individual skill' to be able to execute a decent FC / PL Strat and the SL's tactics that go with it. About 230 more actually. The better they are as individuals, the easier they kill and gain territory -be it a hill, a vital corner, an important building or a cap point- the easier it gets for SL's and hence PL's and hence the FC.  individual skill is the foundation on which a strategy can be executed well.  (or -if you will- better then a force with less skill overall)   Our fundament is (or was) too weak. And it will stay weaker then it can (and should) be if you keep fooling yourself.   Other servers win with worse outfits.""   Wrong. It might be possible that a server fields a few players of an Outfit that's actually weaker then our weakest one. But overall -as a total Force- skill wins you games. Their overall Force composition will have been made up of a higer percentage of better players.   Better players make split-second better calls. Better players kill more (then their enemy) and thus gain their objectives faster and most likely at less cost (in time, in recourses, in numbers) then their opposition. While a better strategy is a big big boon, it's all the little things that better enemy individuals do that start to stack up...and in the end (after 2 hours).. they will tear your strategy into bigger and bigger pieces.  At one point, -even with better overall strategy- the FC that leads the less skilled force, will have to choose the 'lesser of two evils'... and from that point onward, it will only go downhill.  :/  (P.S: Sorry for the wall of text)"

Besides that the statement is generally not true, it is also not possible to make such a general statement about orbs.  On a personal note: Our size will always label us and in some aspects which is not doing us justice.

MillerPlanetside,3d3p4r,Conchubair,3,Mon Jul 13 09:01:10 2015 UTC,They document the threshold before getting banned and it is even written in the rules to do so. This is nothing else than testing out the anti-cheat which is not allowed. Even you should get that conchubair.

MillerPlanetside,3d3p4r,TheRTiger,2,Mon Jul 13 07:25:17 2015 UTC,DBG has a (new) automatic banning system in place to catch cheaters sooner. They are trying to trigger it on new accounts w/o actual cheating.

MillerPlanetside,3d3p4r,Conchubair,2,Mon Jul 13 07:33:28 2015 UTC,Yes. That's the (end)game.
MillerPlanetside,3d3p4r,ScienceGaveMeAHadron,3,Mon Jul 13 07:50:28 2015 UTC,"It's a new system and I would expect false positives. Also it's probably better for the servers that a few great players get ""so good DBG thought I was hacking"" awards than cheaters ruining the experience for players, especially new ones."
MillerPlanetside,3d3p4r,Conchubair,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:56:56 2015 UTC,"The false positives are extremely dodgy though, 2.7 KPM is not particularly high, nor is 61 kills in 11 minutes at a good farm indicative of a cheater.  I think they definitely need to autoban the obvious things but I dont' think 61 kills is enough to instantly ban someone from the game."

MillerPlanetside,3d3p4r,Conchubair,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:53:30 2015 UTC,"Huh? Getting banned doesn't mean anything especially not on a fresh account which is clearly under very high scrutiny for 'hacking'.  If anything the bans could be triggered by assumed padding, given that the ban occurred straight after killing newly rezzed low BR players I'm assuming it's something to do with padding or killing someone quickly after they spawn."
MillerPlanetside,3d3p4r,MasherusPrime,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"Frankly, who cares? It is a race to finish and he finished under 12min.   Next notable performance is when someone gets banned faster."

MillerPlanetside,3d3p4r,Friulano,0,Tue Jul 14 10:27:23 2015 UTC,Schwak found a really nice farm where he could get a lot of kills in  a short period of time which triggered the autoban. This has little correlation to whether he's a better player or not. Statistically someone better will come along and beat his record.

Cause, you know... Shotguns... with slugs...  2: It works better then with infantry, since you only get a savior kill if the guy you saved took health damage. And since MAXes don't have shields..."

MillerPlanetside,3d3zla,1NieMamPomyslu1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"Haven't done it yet, but savior kills seems easier. Since they count for every enemy that had dealt some dmg to your ally's health bar (NOT shield bar), going along a MAX unit should get the job done (since MAXes don't have shields, just health). Someone would need to confirm this method though, I am not really sure."

Why we should not push only with infantry. Why combined arms is needed. But in a big long messages. And this resulted in kick.

It is not problem for me to form platoon. And dont tell me ""if you dont like make own platoon"". If I even make my own platoon others will still do mistakes. SO I just gave advice.

Therefore if you can find an outfit that is willing to take you on board then it is all good, and no rules are broken.

MillerPlanetside,3cwfi5,Shenel,7,Sat Jul 11 10:17:36 2015 UTC,"Very Experienced PC builder here... This is a very good build. You don't need a better CPU, not really worth it for gaming nowdays. Won't gain much performance.  Now the 2x 970's i would recommend them if you had a greater than 1080p resolution because the scaling is generally really good at very high resolutions. If i were you i'd spend 50$ more than the 2x 970 and get a 980ti, because first, you'd have more than 4gb of VRAM for more futureproofness and also a lot of games run like shit or aren't compatible with SLI.  Even a 980TI won't be ""enough"" for some games at 1080p, just see the witcher 3 for example, you'd barely get above 65~fps at max settings with a 980ti. So, future games, you never know.  As soon as you push the AA and shadows, you know what happens anyway... So if you want high frame rates , go for the best.  If you don't have enough money for a single 980ti, get a sightly cheaper mobo (120-140$) and cheaper RAM. Also you don't need 16GB of ram for gaming.  And for god's sake get a MSI one, i've tried windforce, DCu2, strix, and twin froz V. MSI has the best cooler atm.  If you wanna reach 4.5,4.6 Ghz, you'll have to be a bit lucky, not all chips can run this high. But still quite a lot of them though. But you'll definitely have to up the voltage quite a bit, so either get a big cpu air cooler or a water cooler. Anything that is around the size of a coolermaster Hyper 612 will do the job very well but don't get a smaller as the fan will need to spin really high to cool dat.  Ah, if you get a single 980ti, get a smaller power supply. 500 or 550w will be perfect, also more efficient as you'll use 60-80% load while gaming.  PS: i insist , DO NOT SPEND MORE ON THE MOBO, NOT WORTH IT."

Once you feel the single 980ti isn't enough any more you'll be much more tempted to buy a new card instead of buying another old card.   But yeah if you would really go for 980ti sli I would guess you need at least 750W if not more with overclocks.
MillerPlanetside,3cwfi5,Hugohein,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:55:52 2015 UTC,"700W is a minimum for 980Ti SLI, and it might not be stable, so 750W is good."
MillerPlanetside,3cwfi5,Hugohein,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:12:57 2015 UTC,I can recommend that you save on something in order to get better processor cause game performance nowadays highly depends on processor as well.

MillerPlanetside,3cwfi5,Hugohein,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:41:04 2015 UTC,"well just saying. I have a benq XL2420T, for big environment games such as planetiside 2, this monitor just sucks imo. Cant see anything, everything is just blurred togehter, getting a icc profile from tftcentral did help though, when I get rich im getting a eizo :)"
MillerPlanetside,3cwfi5,Redzy1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:52:05 2015 UTC,"The BenQ XL2411Z is great value for the price. You can't go wrong. If you want colour fidelity and picture quality, you want an IPS panel, but those are not yet quite on par in terms of response time and input lag.  If you had a (much) larger budget a monitor with G-Sync would have been something to consider, but this will net you fluid response if you can deal with the tearing on games where getting 144fps all the time in a stretch. In a game like CS:GO with such a machine, however, you'll at least triple 144fps and tearing becomes far less of an issue.   Of course all I can recommend if you want to have an edge in terms of visual response in online games is to keep the quality as low as possible to remove clutter and gain precious frames. You want to have as stable a 144fps as you can get.   It'll make the game look like shit, but you'll not be able to go back."
MillerPlanetside,3cwfi5,lalionnemoddeuse,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:58:57 2015 UTC,"benqs are really fast monitors like 1-2 ms?. thats fast!, but I have found that quality this bad, makes my reaction time quite lower.

MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,Cephas00,3,Sat Jul 11 22:16:38 2015 UTC,Good to hear Br4gi!
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,Damatoe,-8,Sun Jul 12 10:43:19 2015 UTC,Attention whores. nuf said.  Would have been a surprise if you actually were strict wit your decision to leave SS.
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,Br4gi,11,Sun Jul 12 11:29:58 2015 UTC,C'mon man. Give me a break here.   I pulled -us- (just INI) out based on the changes in the rules that again halted the progress we'd been making up untill the last Briggs match and the previous 3 matches. There were lots of Miller people rooting for Briggs for crying out loud.   We discussed this among ourselves (just INI) and we thought we'd just be frustrating ourselves (because of the bad game-play/ losses AND the excuses and drama) instead of enjoying it. That's IT.  I wasn't expecting so many Outfits to follow suit when we said we wouldn't play. Not at all. All of a sudden I felt responsible for 160 guys dropping out. Like what the hell?  Attention whore? Get over yourself.
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,splinterrat,3,Sun Jul 12 13:26:18 2015 UTC,we should have sat out and watched you get crushed.
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,Cephas00,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:17:51 2015 UTC,I don't think we need to try and cause more drama around this. Let's be happy we have some more outfits wanting to play and can field a diverse team.

MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,KVolker,2,Sun Jul 12 16:38:29 2015 UTC,And how can individuals sign up may I ask?
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,Poleander,5,Fri Jul 10 12:26:11 2015 UTC,I think just turn up on matchday and go to the reserve channel and hope you get picked ^
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,KVolker,2,Fri Jul 10 16:09:47 2015 UTC,"If it comes down to it, that's what I'll do, although I might go for piloting then.  At least for the Briggs Match I'll go reserve, I'll just be back from my holidays and can't go through the practicing before :/"
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,0rbitalstrike,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:30:44 2015 UTC,If you want I can put you down for the DIG team maybe? KOTV usually runs their own team though so I'd ask sakura first.
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,KVolker,2,Sat Jul 11 01:20:29 2015 UTC,"It's been a long time since we played in server smash (apart from one server smash ago where we had 3 people in the air). I believe more than one season.  Sakura has her opinion on it, as she organized the server smash team last, and had a very unpleasant surprise when lots of people didn't show up...  But I believe that was some time ago, and I personally might join you in the DIG team. I'll come discuss it on your TeamSpeak next week."
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,Neeelshrav,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:56:13 2015 UTC,Can i just note; We [KOTV] aren't putting in a team for infantry SS; obviously you can always sign of for air : and playing as a reservist or with [DIG] is not a problem; as long as you maintain the relationship (which currently is well...)
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,KVolker,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:29:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah don't worry I know... I've talked to Psychozander about it, and I haven't said anywhere that we were having a team for sure. Although now I know who might be looking for extra players =p"
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,Neeelshrav,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:13:41 2015 UTC,Aight no problem man; just you know; being on the other side of the world; is hard to co-ordinate teamspeak 'talking to' times with XD. But that's all i would have told you on TS anyway.

MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,Morfildur,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:12:56 2015 UTC,It wasn't intended as a negative comment. It was probably more negative than it had to be since I've slept the whole last week on a camping mat on a wooden floor and so was even grumpier than usual.

MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,KVolker,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:52:10 2015 UTC,Units are also subject to all the same expectations an outfit has. That means you must have a way of guaranteeing your numbers.
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,Cephas00,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:18:01 2015 UTC,Damn :/   I guess I'll make a post to find some people if my outfit isn't involved enough...
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,KVolker,2,Fri Jul 10 13:27:24 2015 UTC,You could also ask an outfit if they need more numbers. You could also come along as a reserve on the day and possibly get to play.
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,Cephas00,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:31:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll definitely try that also! Thx"

MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,TheRTiger,-4,Fri Jul 10 18:48:12 2015 UTC,in earleir smashes you could also have just formed as an outfit on alts and it would count. because every outfit gets an equal chance right? or atleast should according to you guys anyway
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,KVolker,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:58:07 2015 UTC,Is this the deadline for signing up to the Connery match or the tournament
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,TheRTiger,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:49:15 2015 UTC,This is the whole tournament. You can sign up for attendance on each match on the form.
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,NijIpaard,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:56:07 2015 UTC,"Some of the matches are a very long way away, if I put myself down for matches in the future and something comes up am I going to get yelled at or is it just for selection consideration."
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,TheRTiger,2,Fri Jul 10 10:01:23 2015 UTC,According to the document   Once the signup period is over a meeting is held with the reps and all FCs.   At the meeting the teams for the first two matches will be decided.   The second two matches will have their teams drafted but not confirmed.       So I'd expect no yelling since the later matches are open to changing.
MillerPlanetside,3cs5gw,Cephas00,2,Fri Jul 10 10:36:22 2015 UTC,Can confirm we have split match 3 and 4 off so new signups can be made for those matches

I don't know whether I'm just more lucky or less picky about lag than a lot of other players, but most of the problems I experience I  can pretty much attribute to the clientside model of the game rather than actual lag or server issues.  At this point in my Planetside 2 life I've pretty much just accepted the slightly asynchronous nature of the game, so I rage much less than I used to over small issues like lag."

Anyone who fails to hand in their essays will not be allowed onto the school trip to serversmash on the weekend!"
MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,DOTZ0R,16,Wed Jul 8 13:38:51 2015 UTC,"---------------------- On Importance Of KDR As Performance Metric In Planetside 2 ----------------------  !This essay contains extremely biased opinions without any data to back them up.  There is a common misconception among players shitters who can not face their mediocrity that KDR is not important in an objective based game like PS2. While it is true in very specific cases, for the most part the notion of such a basic stat being useless is erroneous.  I will start with listing the exceptions, these are the purely supportive role that don't allow player to score a kill and rhey are extremely rare. Dedicated galaxy or valkyrie pilot, sunderer driver are the only roles that completely fit this description, all other support roles give player an ability to kill others while staying alive. Other playstyles are based around killing opponent and pushing the frontline(HA, MAX, Infiltrator, Vehicle gunner/driver/pilot), as one can not advance to the objective without eliminating enemies first, or supporting the combat oriented players while still maintaining ability to shoot back (Engineer, Medic). The need to sacrifice one's life to save/eliminate vital asset such as sunderer comes rarely and has no meaningful long term effect on KDR. So it is save to say that KDR is either primary or secondary performance statistic for the overwhelming majority of playstyles in PS 2.  Now I will address the most common argument against KDR, which is that death has no value because it is easy to revive a dead player. While death comes and goes easily in PS2 it is not meaningless, it is still a punishment for one's failure, for being ineffective at his task of killing enemies and advancing. By not dying a player that is working towards objective saves time for the medic and himself while also killing the opponent in certain cases. There is no downside to not dying while the opposite hurts both player and his team.   Second form of the same argument is that it is better to die multiple times doing good for the team rather than not die while trying to increase one's KDR. This statement is true, but most roles excluding above mentioned exceptions do not require a player to die multiple times in a row without scoring a kill, most times player shitter simply fails at his objective due to poor planning or lack of teamwork.  Lastly I would like to say that there are ways to alter one's playstyle to increase all metrics from accuracy to SPM, but this is why all sensible elite players take into account all the statistics available and some firsthand experience of player in question to analyze his performance. It should be understood that every metric on it's own is fairly weak, but KDR holds a special place among available statistics because of how natural and basic it is for FPS games which have shooting others while not dying at the core.   TL;DR here  In conclusion, KDR is one of the most important metrics in PS2 and while there are ways to circumvent death it is close to impossible to provide the right circumstances the whole duration of one's play session, the same is true for rare cases when one must die to complete the objective, these don't have a large impact on overall KDR which gives a good assessment of player's pure FPS skill compared to players with similar playstyle, on the other hand raw SPM is the closest thing to skill metric in PS2 as a whole.  Do I get my free ticket with candy and access to elite side now?"

MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,Wenzington,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:28:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not going for 500 words (tapping away on my phone). K/D can be a useful metric if used in the right way, but for most players it actually just make them less aggressive and thereby less of a threat and less helpfull in capturing and defending bases.   Personally I always check that I'm in average stay bellow 1.0, what ever game I' m playing.   Say what!?!   Well ... if you are achiving a higher than 1.0 K/D, you are most likely playing against players that are less skilled than you are. If you want to improve at anything you want to seek out and take on the people that are better than you. Playing agains better opponents will force you to improve your game to keep up and you are more likely to pick up ideas on how to improve by trying to figuring out why they are repeatedly beating you up."
MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,goozzze,4,Wed Jul 8 21:25:42 2015 UTC,"Well ... if you are achiving a higher than 1.0 K/D, you are most likely playing against players that are less skilled than you are. If you want to improve at anything you want to seek out and take on the people that are better than you.    Increase quality or quantity, you improve either way.   Actually, your post made me think that KDR matters even more in PS2 because in other FPSs one is placed among equally skilled people in lobby, so KDR can fluctuate wildly for different players in different skillgroups.   In PS2 though, you have the same group no matter the skill. So the invisible player quality variable is removed (with large enough sample size you theoretically face completely average player every time) and the only thing left is quantity, the KDR itself.   So in PS2 direct comparison of KDR of pro and noob player makes sense, while in CS:GO comparing not only KDR, but most other metrics between players in different skillgroups gives you very little information. KDR is even more important as performance metric than I thought!"

MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,Lonny1985,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:34:19 2015 UTC,"In PS2 though, you have the same group no matter the skill.   The problem is that the population is very spread out and it's very easy to only go up against weak players. As an example, during prime time alerts most of the good players are on the alert continent, which means that if you don't play on it, you'll encounter almost exclusively fairly weak players. If you constantly avoid alerts ""because they are shitty gameplay"", then you constantly go up against weak players and will end up with a significantly higher KDR compared to those that play alerts and go up against in average more skilled opponents.  The difference also applies to other situations, e.g. off prime vs prime time, fighting the losing faction vs fighting the winning faction, etc.  When I was playing on Cobalt to pad my KDR, I was surprised how easy it was to judge from the map whether that fight would be against easy or against hard opponents. Usually I always pick the fights that are hard, which all too often ends up fighting some of the well known higher skill outfits like RO (bane of my existence), but for that character I simply went for fights where I was sure not to encounter anyone skilled and I was pretty much right every time and my KDR skyrocketed without me actually trying very hard. By simply choosing different fights, my KDR doubled or even tripled without me actually playing better.  That led me to the conclusion that the impact on KDR for playing for the objective isn't merely from running into death more often, but also from going up against stronger opponents in strategically more relevant bases. When you constantly have to resecure the point against a - as an example - RO point hold, your KDR will be much worse than having to resecure a DIG point hold.  Of course there are far more variables, but in the end you do have a lot of control over how skilled opponents you go up against and so KDR at it's worst is merely a result of your ability of picking the right fights - I call that the ""Daddy Effect"", remembering the months after release where Daddy used his impeccable sense at finding groups of opponents without AA to pad his KDR mercilessly."
MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,Morfildur,6,Thu Jul 9 06:27:21 2015 UTC,most of the good players are on the alert continent   And your assumption is based on what evidence?
MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,Lonny1985,3,Thu Jul 9 06:38:15 2015 UTC,"If you constantly avoid alerts ""because they are shitty gameplay"", then you constantly go up against weak players and will end up with a significantly higher KDR compared to those that play alerts and go up against in average more skilled opponents.   Morfildur, sorry but you seem to only grasp the situation of KDR from your point of view, created by your own skillset, playstyle and mentality. Comments like these show how limited your perception of your personal gameplay still is. This is no insult or flame, it is just a fact that every person improving has to go through these stages of development that don't allow for an unbiased analysation.  You are right that it is possible for improving players to pad their KDR by choosing fights carefully and not going against good opposition. But you are wrong with the assumption that playing against good players = lower KDR. If you don't change your playstyle accordingly to the situation and the opponents, yes it will drop your KDR - but noticing this is what defines a good player and he will choose his engagements differently.  But he won't be as effective while doing so? No, he will still get the maximum efficiency compared to ""normal players"" out of it depending on what the situation is allowing. Dieing more has nothing to do with that.  Your perception seems to be, that good players play for KDR. In reality they play for efficiency. They may often play passively in your eyes but in truth they play to stay alive to be able to switch to agression at the most efficient time. Often creating the circumstances or opening for that situation beforehand by themselves.  When you play against a squad of INI, you have to play like you are facing a squad of INI. Its so simple. If you can't create an opening that is allowing for efficient advancement you won't create an opening at all, no matter how. Keep in mind: i am talking about a 50/50 or underpopulated fight here - as these are the defining factors of every server smash. A +30% overpopulation rush will most likely break that situation, but we are not talking about tactical metagame here but of player and outfit skill."
MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,redpoin7,3,Thu Jul 9 09:28:39 2015 UTC,"I think, but I'm not Morf so I can't say for sure, but the point he is trying to make is that a player who is focused on maintaining a good KDR will go to a base and see it is held by RO and knows he/she will take 10 deaths to maybe, but not definately, break their point hold, as such a KDR focused player will pick another fight thus preserving his KDR. A player who is not KDR focused will go through the grinder in the hope of that 1 time out of 10 where the attack works assuming the numbers are 50-50.  How many times have the elite outfits wiped out a WASP point hold? Lots. How many times have WASP held out against the elite outfits. Lots. Why? Because elite outfits don't bang their heads against brick walls, if there is not enough time to succesfully break a point hold and you beat their team once they go somewhere else where they can be more use and I think this is the point that a lot of people can't get their heads around that good players/outfits know when they are in a situation that they are unlikely to succeed so they go and find another fight, not to protect their KDR but because they won't make a difference where they currently are and they are quick to realise this so move and since the game has no real win objective there is nothing that dictates that they stay and fight a disadvantaged fight to the bitter end - hence a lot of misconception that good players don't play the objective, whereas it is in fact a case of good players being able to quickly analyse a situation and realise the odds are heavily stacked against them and they move somewhere they can be more use."
MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,Ulysees2010,3,Thu Jul 9 10:00:52 2015 UTC,"Well said. Its about efficiency. But also about processing information and acting upon it. In a live server environment it might be more efficient to leave for a fight where you can have a bigger impact.  In a Server Smash setting it might be more efficient to bind as many enemy forces as possible for long periods of time, but that is done best and with the least amount of people needed if you don't die while still keeping the up the pressure.   An example: You are on a point hold outside. There is one single Light Assault on a roof to your flank. Just him being there and you knowing it, has a bigger impact then him killing 3 players and then dieing in the process."
MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,redpoin7,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:42:09 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's take a game of CounterStrike: In a pub match, a progamer might go 50/0. In a pro match, a progamer will do well if he gets a 1.0 K/D and they often end up with less.  Different opponents, different KDRs.  While it's true that you have to adapt your play style to your opposition, the difference in skill of your opponents will always have an effect on your KDR. The only way to avoid that is to not actually fight 50/50s against better opponents."
MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,Morfildur,2,Thu Jul 9 09:50:54 2015 UTC,"I think we are arguing over the wrong fact. I never said that it is not possible to pad ones KDR.  My reasoning is more aimed at stating that KDR seen in context of other stats, even with some padding is a very good metric to judge a players skill (he has to be a decent battlerank). And that on a general level, the 2-3 deaths you take when trying to fight in the right way  against better opponents have a negligible impact on the overall KDR of a player.  Also, the more you die the less efficient you can be. Its the hard limiting factor. Being efficient against better opposition is still being defined by your battle uptime wich results in a good KDR.   An example: You are on a point hold outside. There is one single Light Assault on a roof to your flank. Just him being there and you knowing it, has a bigger impact then him killing 3 players and then dieing in the process"

MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,Definia,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:09:51 2015 UTC,"it helps me alot.   when i get into a new area i zoom out and try to understand what is happening and then i zoom in when i enter buildings etc..  if you are playing alone try to find good players and follow them in the fight. stay not too close and not too far from them.  good players do that all the time, use others as meat shields.   also using proximity helps alot especially when you are with 3 - 4 other random people. ad hoc grenade spam and then rush.. stuff like this.. every little thing that you do matters.   oh.. and if you said you are a ""shitter"" please don t stay in the middle of the doors :) because another shitter will come and try to revive you and he will get killed.  always move from cover to cover. always have in mind where you are going next. never stay in the middle of the room when you are holding a point.. there is a lot of stuff that comes only after practice.  training is only 10 percent when such examples are explained and demonstrated. the rest is experience.    my advice is find an outfit or make a small group of people that want to know eachother and how they play.  a good squad will never be composed from killing machines. a good squad is a group of people that are used to working togheter. from knowing their voices to knowing their capabilities.. that is a good squad. a tight group. that's mostly the reason for all the drama lately. tier 1 outfits that have worked togheter for years don t want to depend on groups of players that can t even tell who is talking in the channel. when vogu plays i don t even need to ask for classes or anything.. if i hear my support guys talking then i know i have medics and engineers, spies etc.  if i recruit someone new to the outfit and put the vogu tag next to his name that does not mean he is pro or anything. it's a guy with potential that will eventually become a part of the group. he will learn our tactics and how we opperate."

So when the fights get closer to warpgates the continent gets locked.   bind mouse wheel up mouse wheel down for minimap zoom in/out   I tried that but didn't find it that useful. I often have well enough time to use the arrow keys to zoom in and out the minimap before I get into the fight. I would use the mouse wheel for more useful things such as jump."

Seems like I've hit a K/D plateau - rose from 0.9 to 2.1 since i've started to care about the stat (around 6 months of play), but it seems to have tailed off.  I have this terrible habit of not moving my arm when I play, so my entire mouse movement comes from my wrist which means that I play on a high DPI setting (1950) with an ingame sens of 0.36.  My computer's currently shitting itself (CPU cooler decided to leak the other day, currently RMA'ing it), but when I'm back, i'd appreciate some tips from some of the better players of the game if anyone is up for it. It would be much appreciated.  Edit: I'm definitely hampered by my extremely shitty start and K/D back in 2012, this is my first character yadayada, but still looking for tips."
MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,Zandoray,3,Wed Jul 8 23:20:06 2015 UTC,"I have this terrible habit of not moving my arm when I play, so my entire mouse movement comes from my wrist which means that I play on a high DPI setting (1950) with an ingame sens of 0.36.   I play on 800 DPI and 0.25. And that comes down to 12.2 cm / 360. This is considered a pretty high sensitivity. You play on a 2.6 cm / 360 cm which is ridiculously high.  I usually dont give this advice, but - definitely lower your sensitivity. It helps so much with being accurate and ability to track. I'd advice to change it to atleast 10 cm to start with and possibly lower your sensitivity gradually.. You can use this calculating website to figure out what ingame sensitivity you'd need for it.  If you arent already, start focusing on the neck / head area only and try to get quick consecutive headshots.   Also on which settings do you play and can your computer run PS2 above 60 fps constantly?"
MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,Vaeka,2,Wed Jul 8 23:52:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's crazy high but lowering it hampers my ability to turn around corners and do 180's if anyone gets the jump on me.

MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,Lonny1985,2,Thu Jul 9 00:10:48 2015 UTC,"If you are flying put your particles on high. On the ground you'd want particles on low.   Go to VR and just shoot at the dummies and do sudden changes in target, to get used to the sensivity. Once you are no longer frustrated by having to move your arm, try to go to small 1-12 fights to get used to targets fighting back. Slowly get used to it, dont instantly think; THIS FUCKING SUCKS IM TURNING IT BACK UP HIGHER. Stick with it, hit some dummies in VR and then start shrecking Planetmans."

I'll definitely try lowering it though, and play with it for a few days and see how my general K/D does.   Going from extremely high sensitivity to lower sensitivity will feel sluggish for awhile, there's no way around it apart from actively playing. The problem is that you are used to certain kind of settings, changing settings means you need to adapt.  Using lower sensitivity means you need to use your arm more instead of your wrist.  Few points which might help:    Lower your sensitivity in intervals. It takes time to find a sensitivity that fits you perfectly.  Changing your sensitivity settings might (and most likely will) mess up your game a bit in short term. It might feel counterproductive at the start because your hand will hurt, your KDR will go down and even your accuracy might suffer. Just bear with it.   Here's a very good guide written by an AC member: http://voodooshipping.net/forum/m/14480460/viewthread/15732727-encyclopedia-modern-aiming-now-100-less-hacking-lizard-people"
MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,BoxDirty,0,Thu Jul 9 09:32:59 2015 UTC,"Indeed, i'll do that. I've tried lowering my sens in the past but only by small increments. Nothing major. I've always upped it after a day or two though because things feel sluggish, as you said.   Thanks for the link to the guide."
MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,Lonny1985,2,Thu Jul 9 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"Tips I would give for becoming a better player:  I guess you already realize what your weaknesses are in terms of aiming-components(Crosshair-placement/Flicking/Tracking/Prediction). Just continue to weed out flaws.  In general it makes sense to start on theories of decision making. Basically what your EV(Expected Value) of a play is and judging if it's -EV or +EV. Also you can make use of variance. If a play is actually -EV, but has a high variance, you can actually try to gamble.(In general a good advice if you feel like you are the lower skilled player. There is no need to gamble if you have the upper hand)  Basically a good place to start is theory about blackjack or poker, since (like most FPS) they are games with incomplete information.   In general this will affect your decision making and positioning. Once you got the theory down your successrate(K/D) depends on how well you can actually judge situations and how many fucks are given.   A tip for simply improving your K/D without actually growing as a player: Spam more force-multipliers."
MillerPlanetside,3cjbdg,Squirreli,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:48:27 2015 UTC,"I think I already realise what I'm doing wrong, yeah. I don't know of a way to fix it however, lest I completely retrain my mouse movement muscle memory and use my arm to move the mouse instead of just my wrist.  Is a low DPI but extremely high in-game sens better to compensate than a high DPI, low in-game sens?  What exactly do you mean by -EV or +EV? I'm a bit confused on that.  Improving the theory is a good place to start, and I'd like to think i'm okay with stuff like that, but I just fail at the actual mouse movement, FPS, and 1v1 aspects of the game. I'll shy away from force multipliers because I doubt they'll help me improve in the long run."

No need to ADS though I have a bad habit of doing that from using other guns.  It is quite accurate at mid range so the 2x helps with that.  It's also on one of the driver engy builds so if I do jump out its usually at mid ranges I'm engaging at.  Though truth be told its really just on there to pick up a kill or two if I bail from something to eventually aurax it, not a massive deal of thought went in to it.

In a standard duel I must be accurate  and well placed, to take out my opponement before he can fight back. For doing this the adv.laser is a must have (best ADS for the best accuracy ratio), it's important when you only got 900HP (i run with 4x EMP's)...According to [OCB] Conchubair and some guys on twitch (harvester/fleischwolf) extended mag and 2x is the usual way to play smg on a ""normal"" class.

Outfits dropped, fairly, for basically attempting to waste everyone's time, including their opponents should accept it and correct their attitude for next time and not cry to PSB admins.   PSB admins shouldn't be approached about selection issues or complaints. They shouldn't be involved selection unless it's real cronyism or blatant team stacking. And on the subject of stacking/cliquing; giving all the top outfits two squads in a team of 240 is something no other sever has ever done, and would definitely be stacking an exclusive club into the team."

That is a lot different to the older larger matches, and that's why it's so noticeable and affects many more people who don't get to play. At most anyone ever did was top 2 or 3. You're looking to double that? with only 240, did anyone think that wasn't going to be messy?"
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,ScienceGaveMeAHadron,0,Wed Jul 8 01:47:05 2015 UTC,Did anyone actually claim that? No they didn't.  The only outfit that has ever wanted 2 squads in a smash is Mercenaries. INI and RO has generally signed up 18 guys with extras in the air squad. No other outfit signs up with more than 12.

MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,ScienceGaveMeAHadron,4,Wed Jul 8 12:26:39 2015 UTC,"Well generally in Cobalt smashes multiple outfits get 24, in Emeralds smashes the outfits I think anyone would class as elite (TIW, BAX, L/BLOP) get larger amounts up to 24.  Seeing as many people from different outfits have all pulled out there are multiple opinions.  MCY have not pulled out but state that they will play if their services are required but they have conditions that have to be met, one is bringing 24 guys because that is how they operate and practice. If that is not met fine, just don't ask them and call when you need them.  INI, UFO's pulled out because they did not feel their players have fun when the rest of the team is below a certain threshold of skill. They will only play if the rest of the team has a certain competency and since no demonstration of what teams are going to be comprised of has been put forward they are not playing.  RO, FOG have pulled out due to being attached to other outfits, RO does not wish to play without INI being present and F0G I'm not too sure about but they are co-operating alot with RO so look there.  VIB have pulled out because the majority of their players do not feel they will enjoy the matches with the current roster and atmosphere shown so, since they are a casual group of friends (although elite players) they have pulled out.  Finally VoGu I am not too sure about, I am waiting to the last possible minute to hopefully see some action been taken by the people with the ability to make something happen on either side. I've proposed terms to both sides but nothing yet. With the current roster I see no possibility of an enjoyable performance so with the feedback from a lot of players opinions that I value I will probably not play as well."

MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,DJCzerny,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:58:32 2015 UTC,Since we have had two 240 matches we've not needed to.   That's all there is to say.
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,ScienceGaveMeAHadron,3,Wed Jul 8 13:03:23 2015 UTC,"Your server is different than ours, Miller has a far higher percentage of its top players in a small number of outfit.  But oh wait, there is more. You bring FOOL, BLNG, MACS, JEST, RMIS and FACS. Those are all outfits comparable to INI, MCY etc. If that were to happen on Miller they would have no problem playing yet the 'assurances' i've heard are not in agreement with that.  And I repeat again, the only outfit wishing to bring 24 is MCY. Nearly every server repeatedly brings larger than squad sized amounts of their best players, I know for a fact there was more than a squad of F00L brought in for example because I was playing in that squad for that match.  That is all there is to say."
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,SOLAR15,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:16:10 2015 UTC,"in Emeralds smashes the outfits I think anyone would class as elite (TIW, BAX, L/BLOP) get larger amounts up to 24.   Entirely untrue. BLOP runs 6 only. BAX is the only one of those to have fielded more than 12 and that was in a single match (Briggs).  Emerald's selection process limits every outfit to either 12 or 6 slots, contingent on how many you can bring. Nobody gets more than 12, nobody gets more than 6. Thus, in any given match, we have 15-20 outfits playing (adjusting for air numbers) and everything is all equal and fair. ~5-6 outfits get swapped out between matches so everyone gets a chance to play.  Even during the 288 days of last season the process was basically the same because we had so much interest at the start. It was only toward the end of the season that waning interest forced some outfits to field several squads. And it wasn't even the top tier outfits at that, since they were the ones who dropped out."

Each time we thought we'd get better sign ups. Emerald and Miller both ended up short, or with people pulling out and outfits needing to bring two squads. At 240 though we just haven't needed to."
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,ScienceGaveMeAHadron,3,Wed Jul 8 12:44:27 2015 UTC,"What happens if an outfit didn´t play 2 matches, the FC tries to find out their minimum standards, he decides that they don´t match it, and the only other outfit to fill that spot to choose from would be an outfit that played the last 2 matches.  Who will be chosen based on the doctrine.   a.) If the latter one is chosen, too much power is on the FC, and would directly violate the FD (and would make all the criticism against the Briggs match laughable)  b.) If the first one is chosen, the point of minimum standards is moot, and simply is nothing but a shallow rule that has no actual relevance."
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,Ulysees2010,2,Tue Jul 7 22:22:09 2015 UTC,isn't the 2 out 3 matches a rule we imposed on ourselves?
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,ScienceGaveMeAHadron,2,Tue Jul 7 22:38:22 2015 UTC,The system we have in place means an outfit can play 3 matches in the round-robin stage (first 4 matches).  We also have mandatory reserves for each match who could take that spot. So it is very unlikely we would find ourseleves in that position.
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,Ulysees2010,3,Tue Jul 7 22:38:34 2015 UTC,"The problem is these players do not have any past data to trust anything people here say.  Many voices (including your own) have often gone completely the opposite to what these outfits currently want. You have in the past as have many others stated that they are not needed, that they are not more effective than anyone else.  Many angry voices here have risen up and pretty much tried to throw as much smoke and mirrors around to distract everything and everyone from what actually qualifies a good outfit.  That is why I said the onus is on those voices to change the opinions of those figures that do not feel as if anything has changed because if you want my honest opinion (and I will play for RTiger, I trust what he will say) what I have heard does not indicate anything has changed.  At this stage I feel like a broken record, 1 good platoon (which is what I keep getting told will 'always play) is honestly fuck all. You can lie and say it isn't but go back through matches and show me the games where any server didn't have at least 1 platoons worth of competent players. You maybe have the Connery match, but even that had about 24 decently competent players on their side.  When you have hard matches at least half your force needs to be good, minimum. That is why I have said whatever people that are going to put themselves forward for FC should get together and actually give the possible PL's some example teams of what those FC's want to get.  If that happens and we get some idea of what the FC's want, we can work to give them that. Within the realms of fairness.  Otherwise I see no reason to have any belief that anything has changed because I find it hard to think that Millers mindset changed in ~2 weeks."
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,ScienceGaveMeAHadron,7,Wed Jul 8 10:05:09 2015 UTC,"Skrikkity I think the major issue is that tier 1 outfits don't trust anyone else to perform to an acceptable level for them and then point to the last match and Zanders platoons performance as evidence of this point of view not taking into account 2 very important factors that I feel would have totally changed the way that platoon performed.  Factor 1 - Zander tried to be fair to his platoon mates and cut their player allocations to let as many of them play as possible. No matter how you do this whilst admirable from an inclusivness viewpoint it will affect that platoon perfromance because the squads will just not be as cohesive as they would be if they all consist of players from the same outfit and play together regulalrly.  Factor 2 - The most important factor that could have mititgated factor 1 by a large degree in my opinion. Training. Tier 1 outfits don't need to train, their players know the best spots to kill their opponents and naturally the best moves to make in most situations, this is not so true in other levels of outfit and is the thing that I think tier 1 outfits don't get that people who are not so good at the game can be made to perform better with simple practice of where best to setup a kill zone to kill enemy sunderer trains, when to pull a lightining swarm to remove deployed sunderers, where are the best places to setup a counterpush? A good leader who has players working under him willing to drill this shit will perform much better than a good leader, leading average players who just don't have the same in game knowledge/reflex/instinct whatever you want to call it to make the right choices of their own accord 9 times out of 10.  Pretty much all the non tier 1 outfits that play serversmash recocgnise this on at least a subconcious level and put in hours of prep either by running joint ops and building up their platoon cohesion or specific scenario practice and most do this willingly because they don't want to let their server team down.  RPS got finger pointed in another thread for performing poorly in this match, but they have open forums so go back and check the amount of effort these so called casual guys put into their serversmash team and tell me they let the side down after you have spent the hour or so going through all their threads about practice and prep and their own admission at not being entirely happy with their performance on occasion and then the work they put in to improve it.  Zander either said in the stream or in a post that he volunteered for the PL role then suddenly RL took a dump on him so he got too busy to sort out his platoon practices that they normally do, this bit him and his platoon in the arse in my opinion but sometimes this does happen and it can't be helped and I have no doubt everyone in that platoon in that lane played their best but with slightly different circumstances I am sure they could have played better and I am also sure they would be willing to have put in that effort to have done so as well if it had been arranged.  I can understand the MLG guys not wanting to play cos winning don't matter, but don't let them say that winning don't matter to everyone else that is taking part because we all care and we all want to win and a framework has been put in place to try and help non MLG outfits get better. Will it work? Who knows?   We are stronger as a server with the best outfits playing but instead of shit slinging each other we need to accept that the guys who are not as good as the best but are willing to put in the effort to do the things that can give them a better chance of performing well deserve the chance to do so and for us to field as strong a team as possible.  If the shitfits decide they don't need to put in the effort to practice, can just turn up on the day and let the side down they will be found out and they will be barred from taking part and PSB have said this is ok and I use that derogatory term here in my opinion wholly justifiably because if you do this then you have wasted your time and everyone elses time. However I am also sure that we don't have outfits who play server smash who would intentionally play a serversmash match in this fashion."
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,Lonny1985,5,Wed Jul 8 10:50:44 2015 UTC,"MLG guys train, I don't know what to say honestly. I was never bad at this game, from the day I played it I already had experience from other games that was pretty easily transferable to this one.  We do scrims, larger scrims, every squadplay we do is a training since we don't have platoons of our own we have to try and make the best with a small force. We tend to not use resource heavy crutches like MAX suits as players want to be competitive meaning that we do not waste resources on such things in SSmash yet we can somewhat deal with them in equal pop scenarios.  I have players that are good enough in certain vehicles to justify pulling them. Tanks are not good in SSmash but one or two really well played Vanguards/Prowlers are excellent, same with Lightnings. We have people who know exactly how to battlebus and harasser which means we can be very effective.  I cannot handhold a PL before a match, or an SL. They have to be able to adapt to the situation at hand or they will be rekt. Success or failure in these battles is based on cumulative snap-second decisions. To give one example in that Briggs smash which you referenced when we pushed Andvari against the Briggs forces we maintained a strong air presence. People in INI spent months duelling in ESF's before CommClash to be competent in those aircraft, in VoGu I flew ESF in all my live play as A2G support and A2A support to make sure I could win any fight in the air and the same for my guys.   When we were in the Biolab F0G kept their spawns removed and kept them outside the Biolab with Harassers and our air, again stuff that comes from a huge amount of live play. When Briggs tried to counterpush Desspa predicted a MAX crash from teleport, and also predicted they would go behind via Banana building and positioned one squad on the high ground, members in my squad had gotten onto the roof of Gen building with heavy assaults to get a better view and when the MAX Crash came a whole platoon of MAX units was beaten by pure infantry because of height advantage, C4 and conc grenades.   Again I could not drill this into people in 2 hour sessions once a fortnight, it needs to be instinct as it is so situational you need to play by the seat of your pants. I do not rely on just mindlessly telling one heavy to do the special jump to get on the buildings in the biolab, he may be useless up there. I select people who have the experience from years of play to make that call themselves.  Our second VoGu squad had to be created 1 DAY before the match, it was not close to being a majority VoGu, I therefore made sure I selected individuals who would work by my own knowledge of what makes a good player and as a result we worked as a team, people like Hobo, agile etc are all players who can do this.  Getting better as a player is the fundamental, but to do this you have to have that mindset. I have given my criticisms after matches and to plans/ideas before matches and very often I have felt that real, truthful and honest criticism was not actually wanted in those matches.  My door has always been open as has VoGu's, we can be found in our teamspeak most of the time. Same with INI , people are open to join the squads if they wish to learn and improve. But I cannot make a 0.5 K/D player into a 4 K/D farmgod in 1 month."
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,Cephas00,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:24:01 2015 UTC,"Apologies if my post comes across as saying MLG guys don't train/practice as that was not the intent, nor indeed my belief. My main point is that for all the sneering and finger pointing at the ""casual"" outfits and the seeming perception from some that they cannot rely on those outfits to perform, it is my opinion that as long as the ""casual"" outfits server smash teams are willing to put in the time to practice to give themselves the best chance of performing on the day then I am happy to fight alongside them.  Lonny above has cherry picked some bad examples for me in another reply but I am a fan of the RPS community so regularly visit their forums and followed their posts discussing serversmash and their efforts in it and I am happy that for the most part the guys who play serversmash for them are willing to try their best and practice alongside others and also in my opinion that is the case for most of the non MLG outfits who play.  However it might be that the reason I am interpreting why a lot of the high skill outfits have pulled out because if the team cannot contain X percentage of outfits that they deem good enough to give them a shot at winning the tournament they don't want to take part might be wrong in which case I am barking up the wrong tree entirely anyway but I am trying to demonstrate that every outfit that plays is willing to try it's best for the team and if outfits are found not to be then we have agreed to bar them from selection from what I have read so far."
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,Lonny1985,5,Wed Jul 8 11:35:53 2015 UTC,"'Trying your best' isn't good enough, if your best is failing horribly then maybe a 2 hour one-off match isn't the right place to be in.  No one is going to get any better from playing in a server smash, it's 2 hours of play which is very little to do anything in. You can make mistakes and learn from those but if the issue is a sheer differential in skill levels of players then my opinion is go back to live server or play around with sensitivity, mouse, rig, internet or graphics settings but don't think 2 hours of a match is going to improve anything.  The main differences in playing SS and live is 1) You have no option to just call in reinforcements or overpop without damaging your team 2) The general quality of opponents is probably higher than on live.  I see it everyday on live, when we operate we often set up the things outfits use. Science Sunderers, strong defenses in the areas that matter in bases. Or we are operating completely on our own with generally a population disadvantage. That means when it comes to Server Smash and having the onus be on us to set up those solo liberators or tanks that devastate enemy spawns, that solo A2G mossie that farms the enemy we have no problems as that is every day on live to us. Same thing with fighting against equal or overpopulation and decently skilled opponents.  I cannot speak for every single voice that has pulled out but I guess a general consensus you could say is this.  We've won and lost matches since we started playing but that is not important. It is simply not rewarding to play in matches where success is not dependent on our performance but on the opponents lack of it.  It is not enjoyable to either have to totally roflstomp the lane you are put in or wait to be roflstomped by overpop by a lack of pressure elsewhere. As a result in a voluntary event there will be no volunteers if the event is going to be unfun for those players as in the end it is about the fun your guys experience.  Most people will happily play if the team does not have a ridiculous discrepancy in skill levels across, i.e a team that is on average going to hold its ground. I'm sure what that means exactly will differ between people but I've given my analyses of the outfits on Miller to  people to use if they want them and I can always be asked for my opinion but it is just my opinion. I've scrimmed a lot of outfits here an on Cobalt but not all of them.  In the end there are 5 group stage matches, most people do not mind playing in a minority of those where their services are needed if that means more outfit can play in the rest but they want to only play in the games where they feel their team will be pretty uniformly at their skill level which is why I suggested the FC's put together what they want out of the force selection."

MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,Lonny1985,4,Wed Jul 8 17:40:37 2015 UTC,All units now have a set of expectations they must meet. This includes pre-match training and competitiveness measures. If units do not meet these criteria the FC and PL can ask the reps to sanction the units substitution.   This is a phrase without value. What exact measures and criteria are we talking about?
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,Morfildur,5,Tue Jul 7 20:27:47 2015 UTC,Attend regular training sessions with other units they will be fighting alongside. Participate in scrims (informal or formal) against other ServerSmash units. This can be as informal as messaging another unit on Live and requesting a fight on a quiet lane. Show satisfactory performance and attendance at training sessions and scrims. This performance will be judged by the PL and any observers.   The PL and FC have the right to present a case to the server reps for an unit to be removed from a match roster. They must be able to prove that an unit has either:   Failed to attend training sessions; Not been seeking to scrim or otherwise push their individual performance; Has not rectified deficiencies highlighted by the PL or FC related to in-match effectiveness.   These requirements were intentionally not specific because that would have been another week or more of drama. This way outfits can be spoken and know what they need to be doing. In the future we could add extra requirements.

MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,silentstormpt,2,Tue Jul 7 21:19:13 2015 UTC,"Why should they be relative? If the outfits meeting the requirements can't field enough players, the FC should get the outfit to play which is the closest."

MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,StillMostlyClueless,2,Tue Jul 7 20:34:59 2015 UTC,PSB met and decided that the Emerald match system was in violation of the Fairness Doctrine   Not sure why people still say this: this is not the way Emerald does their selection. If it were they would have had the same issue with PSB quite a while ago.

MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,Bazino,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:42:12 2015 UTC,"Atm we have 133 minimum - 214 maximum sign-ups.  24 of them conditional (MCY, condition probably to play every match with 24, since the entered minimum and maximum as 24, so they won't play since this is not allowed by PSB)  And some doubtful. Bunch of 1st-timers too.  Only 4 days left to sign up."
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,Bazino,3,Wed Jul 8 07:37:06 2015 UTC,I know of 3/4 outfits that are planning on signing up and haven't yet. Also air means we only need ~200 infantry signups.  Miller can bring 240 team players.

MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,Squirreli,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:27:17 2015 UTC,"Can an outfit bring 24 players?  Yes, but not for all matches   This is the bit I think we're having the most trouble with.  Did the 2 in 3 matches rule come from PBS, or was it something we suggested to PBS?   To put it another way. If the FC's kept picking MoX to play every match because they wanted them (They won't, but go with me here) would that be against the rules PBS have. Or the rules we made for ourselves? At what point do PBS step in and go ""No you can't have MoX play this match""?   Part of the confusion for me is that I'm never sure if we're violating the fuzzy rules of the Fairness Doctrine, of if we've just imposed a rule on ourselves to make it ""Fairer"" needlessly.   I mean does it mean no outfits will be playing every Emerald match? Because I find it hard to believe that at least one of DA/VULT/GOKU won't do the full set. Or at least more than the 2 in 3 rule we got."
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,Bazino,2,Wed Jul 8 11:29:11 2015 UTC,I don't know where people have gotten this 2 in 3 idea from. That was a suggestion by PSB but not one we adopted.

This ""Every server selects teams their own way"" thing doesn't seem to be very equal, since apparently the way we want to do it isn't allowed.  Are we just being too polite by announcing that we want specific outfits to attend every match, rather than having a tacit agreement to do it that we don't tell PBS?"

MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,HollowStoneVS,0,Fri Jul 10 18:46:39 2015 UTC,"You asked for Force Commanders to be able to select their teams. DONE You asked for more representation of 'strong outfits'. DONE You asked to be able to bring 24 people to a match. DONE You wanted outfits to put the effort into training. DONE You asked for minimum standards. DONE    You should add the restrictions on those too, so that people know why the top outfits pulled out.    You asked to be able to bring 24 people to a match. DONE    This can be done, but if you bring 24 to one match, it counts as taking part TWICE. (This was discussed in the last meeting.)  Since you can only play 2 matches, then have to sit one out, this means that if you play the first with 24, you can play the 4th with 24 and the finals (if we reach them) with 24, so 3 out of 6 matches. Ergo if you play one match with 12, you can't play the next with 24, cause that would also count as 3 matches in a row.    You asked for minimum standards. DONE    When? I do not see a list of things you need to be able to accomplish.    You wanted outfits to put the effort into training. DONE    Unless this is checked, nobody does that. I have been in very engaged outfits, none did train specifically for Server Smash. They train to become better in general, but not once did I manage to get anyone (but me) to even only check out the lane we're playing in detail. Nobody wants to invest that time. Either an outfit is good already, or not. Which is the whole discussion we've been having all the time.    You asked for Force Commanders to be able to select their teams. DONE    Only within the restrictions of the 2/3 - 12/24 rules set by PSB (in the last meeting) which basically restricts them so much that they have to take ""what's left allowed to play"" (by PSB)."
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,Bazino,3,Wed Jul 8 05:51:53 2015 UTC,This is misinformation. As I understand you have access to the miller selection system document. I highly suggest you read it again.    We reset our played counter for the semis and final. Outfits now have expectations they must meet or face being substituted.  Saying noobs will always be noobs or casuals will always be casuals is utter BS. We were all bad once and we trained to get better. We voted against the additional PSB rules in the meeting on Monday.    On another note the system isn't going to change before signups close on Sunday/Monday. So now people just need to decide if they want to take part.
MillerPlanetside,3cgtyq,HollowStoneVS,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:50:21 2015 UTC,"We voted against the additional PSB rules in the meeting on Monday.    haha, yeah, sure, it's PSB rules. They made them official part of the FD in the discussion in the last meeting. It wasn't OPTIONAL, it was a claryfication. At least that's how it was presented to the outfit reps and so we can't just vote against them. So the 2/3 sticks and therefor resetting isn't possible."

Just create the rosters for every match and then start filling them in. We have time to negotiate and balance them. Make as many changes as we want.   Just please stop worrying about selection method, server reps, politicians, people on reddit, their friends.  Start working on something concrete. Make the rosters, let's see how they look and continue from there. Start improving them and let's move forward.   I will repeat this as long as we don t move forward : even if Miller stacks it will not be a walk in the park. It will be a tough tournament and we need all hands on deck.   We need our server to find a way to raise an army and fight."

MillerPlanetside,3ceyph,satrianivai,7,Tue Jul 7 12:03:43 2015 UTC,"The fundamental argument here seems to be between winning and representation.  I strongly recommend that it would benefit us all to look at what the ServerSmash is. To look at what it's role within the Planetside 2 community was designed to be, and ultimately, what the organisation/event is literally defined as.  Once we accept the realities, we can all look to proactively discuss the next step. Voice your opinions on ServerSmash, but preaching intolerance or hate for the rules and identity of it will only do harm, and never change what is set in stone.  There are ways in which we all can enrich and develop the shared experience of ServerSmash, but nothing is achieved through avid discourse or continuous vitriol, especially on Reddit or forums.  If you still disagree with what ServerSmash is, or it's direction, then that is fine. Voice and develop your opinions. But please take a step back, if you have not already, and respect the achievement that is: ServerSmash. It should be respected and appreciated.  Look to what we can do as a community. To how we can bring ourselves the communal AND individual experiences that we are looking for. Whatever your opinions on team format, match results or governing may be.   There is literally nothing to stop people from forming a brand new competition/organisation, should they want to. We are a community and we can do so if enough people desire it. Be democratic, see what the people want and unite to create that atmosphere.  Talking about, encouraging or representing via your actions - segregation, will only breed more of it. We are a gaming community, for a game in which we all love. Segregation will destroy this community. However, co-habitation between two styles/organisations of play will not. Do not destroy or undermine what exists, build along side it."
MillerPlanetside,3ceyph,NickTheNegligent,5,Tue Jul 7 13:36:02 2015 UTC,"It's no segregation though. Everyone will get to play, just some more than others.   The other servers aren't going to handicap themselves for this. If we decide to not put a strong force forward we're going to collapse like last time.  It's a Tournament. You can bet all the other servers will be trying to win it. They've given us the rules and we've decided they're not enough and we have to add our own ones on top.   But there's no reason for Miller to handicap itself for this. We're not that good. We can win it, but only if we try. If we don't take the tournament seriously we're going to get rolled like last time.  Server Smash isn't casual. A lot of planning goes into it, both in force selection and planning. When I play one I give my all for 2 hours and listen to the FC's and PL's to make sure my Squad isn't dicking about being useless and that's not even me being elite. That's what I'd say is the expected minimum.  If we don't want to take Server Smash seriously why even participate? We can just stay on live and ignore it. This idea that we need to make the Smash ""Even fairer"" when no other Server is going to follow our rules isn't going to work out for us."
MillerPlanetside,3ceyph,NickTheNegligent,2,Tue Jul 7 13:50:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear what you're saying. I disagree with the sentiment of 'A Team, B Team' or 'include only the most skilled' just because other servers do the same. ""Our rules"", however disagreed with, mean total equality for the community. Community > Winning. If we alienate the community outfits who are in the transitional space between competitive & casual gaming, simply because 'they aren't as good as other outfits', they will become disillusioned, unresponsive and may eventually or gradually disband. This isn't a community thing to do.  If this was the way, think about what this would achieve, on a larger scale, for the Miller community every time you log in during an evening? I say encourage better gaming levels and develop skills through these events. That's the only way people/gamers learn. Then they may become a real asset in the future.  Whoever wishes to participate, will be included in the Miller team selection phase. I think that is an awesome caveat to have over other servers. I accept what you are saying about them (perhaps) fielding a higher skilled team, but screw that and their non-inclusiveness. I do not assume or pre-judge the Miller selection roster's qualities based on an Outfit tag presence or not.  I would counter what you are saying, and challenge the opinion that it is the other servers who do not ""take Server Smash seriously"" by only incorporating their highest skilled players into a community event. It is a competitive and organised community event. We have put emphasis on the community part, but that's because Miller server best server.  A General (Force Commander) will always have their experienced and highly skilled troops, and those that are less so. That is the nature of conscription. It is down to the FC to try and make it work strategically.   Everyone selected for the Miller team in the past has put in 100%, of that i am sure. I have no doubt that they each echoed your own opinion of our servers chances and what is expected of themselves. And they will continue to do so.  I am all for wanting to win, but i am also all for equality. Why there seems to be an opinion here that achieving the two together is impossible, it's beyond me. The Smash is over in a few hours, what remains is the memories shared by fellow community members. The feeling i had when fighting alongside tag's i recognized during Miller vs Woodman will always remain with me. From MLG to mid-casual, the amazing instances and experiences endure. That is community spirit in my book. And that is what matters more to me than winning (even though we won).  As long as the draw process is fair, que sera. This is a game after all. ServerSmash is comparatively small in the bigger picture of Miller.  Edit: Typos"
MillerPlanetside,3ceyph,NickTheNegligent,2,Tue Jul 7 14:29:02 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the sentiment of 'A Team, B Team' or 'include only the most skilled' just because other servers do the same   If we're not going to compete with other servers on the same level then why bother playing at all?   Nobody likes Miller Lite. It is the worst.  It won't be fun for them, it won't be fun for us. I get that you want fairness, but the system you advocate isn't fair on anyone who plays.  People playing the Smash want to win the match. Or at least I hope they do and they're not just dicking around. I want the FC to pick a team that they think they can lead to win, not one that is ""Fair"" that they didn't actually want.   We tried last tournament to be more ""Fair"" than the other teams and we were. We also came last and that wasn't fun.  I want to be able to say after the match that we did our best, win or lose. If we deliberately sabotage our chances before we even begin I can't do that."
MillerPlanetside,3ceyph,NickTheNegligent,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:53:10 2015 UTC,"Competing is a massive part of the point of a match, i'm with you on that. However, i still don't concede that we would be unable to achieve that without including an entire team of our best players, pooled from a tiny percentage of Miller outfits.   Because then there would be inequality for those who were excluded. You cannot have it both ways. However, you can at the moment, as everyone can be fairly represented. At the moment, the vocal minority out there protesting against the ServerSmash set up because they want to win at any cost - and in their own strict conditions. I am sorry but this is not the Miller i know. We will not pander or bow down or be held at emotional ransom by things that others have said on this sub.  Here's my counter point to what you say: Woodman vs Miller was a prime example of all outfits, highly skilled or casual, working together to win. Regardless of opposition strength. We worked together to win, against tough opposition. Less skilled Outfits held the line, held their own, and were integral for the groups success. These players still play for their respective outfits, this should be remembered before writing off areas of Millers talent pool.  Going back to my initial post, this fundamentally comes down to winning and representation. Many people also feel that you can achieve ""winning"" through having a wealth of participating outfits. Contrary to your standpoint and that of others. You can win because we show off just how much depth and abundance we have in this community. We win because we all experience and work together and that kind of stuff rarely happens. These things are remembered for years and years. They mean more than a tally of victory and defeat stats. Better to fight and fall together than to segregate and blame when apart.   The very vocal minority want to win at all costs. I fear that they do not know this community as well as they ought to, or at least know what the miller community spirit has and always will be. If you honestly think that team Miller would go as far as deliberately sabotaging it's chances because it wants to include all of its children in it's battles, my point is proven. It's proven because you have misidentified a vital aspect and moral of Miller, over a shortsighted (and what will eventually be) long forgotten glory.  I know where i want this communities priorities to lay, and nurturing and creating opportunities for all of its inhabitants to experience amazing and enjoyable things together comes far and beyond adding an extra digit onto a scoreboard."
MillerPlanetside,3ceyph,Lonny1985,2,Tue Jul 7 16:32:49 2015 UTC,"I think my point is are we committed to winning this or not?   Because it sounds like we're not willing to try as hard as the other servers. That we can assume some sort of moral highground by being more ""Fair"" than they are when it comes to outfit selections. This is chasing an award no one but us seems to care about and even most of us don't care about it.  If you think we should give 100% in the match and 100% in the Planning then why shouldn't we give 100% in the Outfit selection too?   No one's going to be excluded. You will get to fight in the server smash at some point not matter how bad your K/D is. Spots will be available. The Core outfits cannot fill a team on their own, they don't have the numbers to even get to half. I've taken part in multiple Smashes purely by hanging about on the reserves.   Other servers aren't doing this ""Well let's treat everyone equally"" approach to Server Smash. They're taking in teams that have a good chance of winning, because they want to win. If we're the only ones taking in teams that were created with ""Fairness"" in mind over actually being competitive, we're not giving them the fight they want and we're not going to get the fight we want either.  Miller right now is trying to make Server Smash more casual than it actually is. If you agree we're there to win the match (And you better be, because no one is more despised than an Outfit that wanders off or doesn't listen to the FC) then you have to agree we need to go in with a team with a good chance of winning the match. Half assing it just isn't in the spirit of the competition."
MillerPlanetside,3ceyph,NickTheNegligent,0,Tue Jul 7 17:23:35 2015 UTC,"There certainly is substance to fielding our statistically speaking, best players. But Stats are only valid up to a certain point. They can insinuate a lot for a player's skill and play style, of course. However, battle instances and strategy are unpredictable and can be inconsistent. In any instance a statistically worse play could get the better of their opposition, that's just a reality of the game and of battle.   Ultimately I don't want to see a Miller team being controlled by a group of players - or Outfits have an unfair tide of influence or monopoly over those who are selected, whether that is briefly, or systematically implemented over time. It should not be a club. It should be and is a place where anyone from Miller can come to represent and fight. It may not be a dream team, by anyone's standards, but labeling that situation as Miller being half assed, casual or >100% is when we start creeping into ""elitist"" attitude territory.   I know wanting to win is meant in good-will and i appreciate that most people want to keep things fair and rotational. But the long-term goal of these events was intended to be a community and server wide experience, involving everyone and open to everyone, this should never be lost or ignored. Not for the sake of winning, not for the sake of pleasing those who prefer to win and not for the sake of any individual. Outfit or Person alike.  This is a sweeping statement to make i know, but those that just care about winning usually achieve their goal and then move onto their next goal, either through seeking a new challenge or through loss of interest. Our community will not bounce back so easily if we treat it in the wrong way, because people do not forget. I feel we must do everything we can to nurture it and protect it from potentially dangerous direction."

However, battle instances and strategy are unpredictable and can be inconsistent.   Just watching the stats for the last match against briggs. Your outfit managed a K/D of 0.46 whereas INI pulled 1.63. Thats quite a substantial difference.  Given that you only had 6 guys I'll also take a look at the last match against Emerald, where you fielded 13 players.  Here INI managed a K/D of 2.21 whereas you guys had 0.55. The difference on a relative scale is the same, whereas the difference on an absolute scale even increases, if you are allowed to bring more players.  So just judging by stats you are inferior to us in terms of strength and I will consider you to be inferior until you deliver some actual metrics which proof otherwise and not some vague shit.  Do you really believe, such an exorbitant difference is explained by different battleconditions?"

We all contribute, stats do not matter as much when you put emphasis on community involvement. Unless of course you are an outfit with no respect or regard for the community you are a part of.  Exorbitant was a word or tone that - i think you'll find - i was nowhere near implying. But then that is the sort of exaggerated conclusion jumping statement that we have all come to expect from people who display this sort of attitude. It is however, a very valid point and a fact that many have experienced on both sides. Whether or not your pride can openly accept to it is another thing, and irrelevant anyway.   I have no problem with Stats focused people, or outfits. I am not here to discuss statistics in depth with you. You seem to have missed the point entirely and jumped in on what you want to see/hear.

You do not think competing is a worthwhile pursuit. Instead, competitive people are harmful to the all-important Miller community (as defined by you).

Platoons were formed with outfits that complemented each other and had experience working together. Rough battle plan for platoon members was communicated more than a weak ahead so we could familiarize ourselves with the main bases we were responsible for holding and taking. We had multiple training sessions and working together to figure out exact times to get to each base and each point in these bases from spawn room and sunderers locations. Platoon leaders was writing up detailed battle plans that was sent out to all members a couple of days before. No 200 word essays, we are talking closer to 200 000 words."

Every server gets to make up their own rules for making a Smash team and if the admins think it's unfair they'll step in.   The Core Group would have fixed this, a solid force of the top Miller outfits that work well together that we can then flesh out with ""Everyone else"" and to make sure you don't think I'm being biased here, my outfit would definitely be in the ""Everyone else"" part of this.  For some reason we're not allowed to do this, despite literally every other server doing this (Because it works)  PSB say we can't make a Core Group, or at best only a Platoon.  If these aren't even official rules, only self imposed Miller rules (And it's really not been made clear to me which is which) then I say fuck it and ditch them, we make the team that will work for the day and PSB can make some damn rules already, rather than hand-wringing over us actually wanting to make a team rather than just throw a bunch of people from live server together and hope it works.   This is exactly the problem. PSB awful ""rule"" if you can even call it like that. They either apply the same rule for everyone or they get the fuck out of here and let every server has is own rules.  What the hell do we have now?

Equal rules for every server or no rules for any server not this biased bullshit bingo please. I know you are smart guys at PSB and you can't tell me you didn't realized by now how fucked up your system is.   Enough whining.    Solution:  Get a grip, get smart people to form out a rule set which applies for every server. Do meetings with every server for input/criticism about it until we have a final document of rules. I know it is not easy nor quick to do but damn everybody knows it's the only solution here. If some servers want their own ""ritual approved"" rules - FUCK 'EM, they can't participate and end of the discussion.

They got in last time in that ""UBERMLGFIGHTS"" versus Briggs.   For once, it was actually a normal Miller line-up though; a very decent representation of Miller across all three factions, but this time, almost all the squads were -you know- ""normal""..as in good. Which is normal for any other game/sport/company/country/whateveryoucomeupwith.  That force only had one weak spot.  You know of whom I speak, Frodo Baggins shrugs  But finally, we -Miller- managed to hold our ground against Briggs.  Now, considering how our succes was met in previous matches, I wasn't exactly expecting flowers and a parade on miller subreddit when we pulled off a win, but neither was I epxecting to be shat on.  Anyhoo....your point about 'no room for newer Outfits' is moot since -even if what you describe as ""UBERMLGFIGHT""- there was room for a totally new Outfit (UFO; both in SS as on Miller Server) and room for a FULL PLATOON of that so-called ""fair and equal"" (I mean YOU) representation.   As a sidenote; You aren't saying VCBC is a 'newer outfit'...are you?  Core-group of 200 players = good. Skill should be praised... not shunned.

We saw the most MLG ragequit because of the randomization, and the losses (remembering Cobalt VS Miller on Esamir...).  We saw exactly the same with the casuals.  The thing is, whatever the roster is, the team chosen for the next smash represents Miller. Whether you're feeling competitive or not, it's a matter of responsibility, and respect to all the server mates who are benched. You got to give your very best.  I'm leaning FOR NOW to the side of ""the best team should play"".   For the future, I think everybody should be given a chance, if they prove themselves. Not by their skills, or reputation.  The priority has to be given to outfits who (has) participate(d) actively in Jeager events: Commclash, PSBL S1 and 2, Armorside, Lanesmash, and Serversmash victories.  Those events have to be promoted. It's a shame there is so few signups to lanesmash. And make no excuses, you always have time to play in those formats. It's just a matter of commitment. We didn't recruit specifically for competitive events, we cope with the members we have. It demands a lot of efforts/time.  For example, we, FRC played: -not Commclash (french zergfit at that time) -PSBL S1: first time scrimming, got crushed pretty bad, but we gained a lot of experience. -PSBL S2: scrimming on a nearly weekly basis, to prepare, despite asking, put in a low division and won it (too) easily. We didn't have the numbers, so thanks to 3-4 LCTH friends, we could participate. -Lanesmash: lost our first match with CSG VS F0G and RO, only by sudden death. Looking forward to play the next, this format is awesome, but to few signups...   All that shit to say, I have dedicated players to competitive play. I posted on my forum a survey to know their thoughts about joining or withdrawing next serversmash tournament, the two main response you can read are: -""I love to play serversmash, but I don't want to play with people who don't care about training/preparing. We had a hard time training,  I don't want to be benched for an outfit who will do poorly, because of their lack of commitment"" -""I'll only play serversmash if we play with our usual platoon""  To finish all this, I have to add that last serversmashes, we played with the same base of players/outfits. Since we're winning more than usual (not that hard...), you can see outfits who never showed interest when we were chain-losing, wanting to sign up. That's no problem for me if they're dedicated to what I was stating before."
MillerPlanetside,3ceyph,MasherusPrime,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:02:50 2015 UTC,"But having a core group every time means it's unfair for newer outfits who want to compete.   I don't think it is. A newer outfit is going to have a lot more fun in a match where they can win than being stuck in a match with other new outfits where we get warpgated.   Maybe they'll have to wait a bit longer to play in the first one, but I'd rather we give every outfit a good shot at victory than be all ""Welcome to Server Smash, prepare to get ground to dust"" and then they never bother to do another."
MillerPlanetside,3ceyph,Claustrophobopolis,2,Tue Jul 7 17:28:01 2015 UTC,"Well, it is. It means that a newer outfit would get to fight like, once. This way, they can fight several times.

MillerPlanetside,3ceyph,muuPt,2,Tue Jul 7 17:52:28 2015 UTC,"A bit off-topic: It's more about good competition and doing your best than the actually winning. Most of the competitive people are having the most fun when they're doing their best and competing in a tough, well prepared and even fight. It is not that they need the win for ePeen size but that competing is their way of enjoying the hobby. For some reason, this ""you are all about winning"" argument has been one of the most fundamental misunderstandings between the competitive and the casual sides of the crowd in every gaming hobby I've had."

MillerPlanetside,3cfevi,ScottishRoss,5,Tue Jul 7 19:45:40 2015 UTC,"Just to comment on how the meeting structure works (i.e. the muted part). This is how us at the VCBC figured out how to do our Community General Meetings. Everything kept getting side tracked or inaudible if everyone could speak. By requesting talk power, the admins can see who wants to raise a point or ask a question, in order. No one would have been ignored for this request, because that is unfair and not how things work. Doing it this way, in your poorly metaphored phrase, means that the meetings don't go on for god knows how many hours of talking absolute horseshit and getting nothing done."
MillerPlanetside,3cfevi,Zandoray,3,Tue Jul 7 17:05:21 2015 UTC,"Also, from my previous experiences from Server Smash meetings, it is simply a good idea to limit speaking power quite radically.   Generally, much of the discussion should be done beforehand, not at the actual meeting."

In the Briggs match we had one lane that was suffering and bleeding. that area was pulling our air and qrf for most of the time. If we have 2 lanes in that situation we lose control.gg  -the people who have experience are muted by self elected politicians.   -PSB is a nice organization but should have never interfered in a server's internal affairs.   -the community lacks leaders now more than ever. people who have the intelligence to take us out of this mess on the right path."

You clearly weren't at the meetings beforehand. If you think there was a lot of BS spouted last night just think about what others are like (regardless of your opinion or PoV). Virtually everyone in those meetings reads reddit anyway so are up to speed with everything. If they aren't then they can still ask and have it explained from a rep.    When Platoon leading you need to know everyones ability and skill before you jump into a match.   That is what tactics meetings are for. Not selection ones.    I'm not going to comment on anything else as i think people (including myself) have had enough of my PoV on selection :P"
MillerPlanetside,3cfevi,Bazino,2,Tue Jul 7 15:43:31 2015 UTC,"I still think we should screw PSB over with their ""Miller unfairness doctrine"" by just putting all interested players in just 1 outfit per faction for the duration of the tournament. We can even call them ""Miller VS Server Smash Team"", ""Miller TR Server Smash Team"" and - you guessed right - ""Miller NC Server Smash Team"".  Only 3 outfits to choose from, gotta be stackin'!"
MillerPlanetside,3cfevi,DOTZ0R,3,Tue Jul 7 14:44:55 2015 UTC,"Dude we should not screw PSB they are working for the community... I think they are very aware that they have screwed up with all these rule setting and just in general not letting teams play together... It's a pitty that none of them are real man and will make a joint decision. BRING WHOEVER YOU WANT FOR ALL SERVERS AND GOOD LUCK.   Gentleman agreement, DONE Deal we go in these Server smash meetings pick our Force commander, let him call out the outfits he wants in his team and GG go from there, no one cares if they get picked or not atleast that way all the players that are picked above us deserve it the same we do since they play together and hard aswell...  Just like last Server smash we had Fara FC he went to pick his platoons and UFOs have never participated but got picked because he saw something in us that made him believe we can get the job done.  Same with other FC's discover good outfits bring them in invite them to play and thats it GG, if individuals want to play bring them to other outfits teamspeaks tell them to play with us and thats it done deal bro. DO NOT COMPLICATE SOMETHING THAT IS SO SIMPLE."
MillerPlanetside,3cfevi,DOTZ0R,4,Tue Jul 7 14:52:12 2015 UTC,"just in general not letting teams play together...   ""Teams"" ""cliques"" - its semantics. There is a difference between a server unanimously agreeing that x and y outfits are the best and saying ""lets all agree for these guys to rep us"" - and solely trying to get a group of outfits to be the only outfits to represent Miller. It is all good and well, being a part of that ""list"" of outfits who are seen / think they are good, and that from that POV - it looks like PSB is stamping down on them, but put your shoes in an average miller players shoes, all they see is a small and vocal group trying to lock them out of a community event. Of course, you want <list of outfits> to represent, but i can guarantee you - that someone else wants <insert another list of outfits> to represent.   If for whatever reason, people got their way - i can guarantee there would be someone else saying ""the Mlg clique won't let our team play together.""  It is NOT about PSB. It is about MILLER. The drama is us/them (elitist/casual) and ""we are good, we are playing or we leave"" the whole drama is people seeing one group trying to take over it, and make miller team made up of a few outfits and lock the doors to other outfits - putting on some restrictions to stop them from playing. You can preach about discovering good outfits, but in this regard there will be no room for new outfits as the core group will just the same outfits, playing match after match. It has nothing to do with PSB rules, except that we pre-empted a system which was massively open to abuse. Not all systems are good or equal, or even fair - and the last method may have worked, but then we heard / say peoples plans to abuse the system to make sure its always the same outfits playing, and what do you know? they got away with it last time - and so they are trying again.  Its all about miller, not being unanimous. About miller not being able to decide themselves what should be done. In one corner, you have a group which wants to have a chance to play like normal and potentially compete, Then in the other - a group of outfits who want to win by being the only outfits representing their server.  However, not everyone on miler - wants a small group to represent them. The small group - doesn't want the others to represent them. People think they are the bees knees, so do others. Some people think casuals are baggage, some people elitists are up their own arse - order-dodging cunts.   BRING WHOEVER YOU WANT FOR ALL SERVERS AND GOOD LUCK.   Who to bring, will differentiate per person - as seen by the last few weeks. Not every outfit on miller is on an open playing field in terms of status/skill/influence. Who decides who to bring? surely, whoever does will just bring who he wants - at the cost of everyone else left out being salty.   Possibilities    Everyone carries on as normal, with everyone having a chance to play. No clique groups. Miller becomes Elitside only, outfits get disinterested as there is no point singing up as its evident who is playing. Outfits become disinterested in the event, as they see it as an event they can no longer compete in due to new found restrictions from a portion of their own server. The vast majority of miller feels stabbed in the back as they don't get to play in a community event."
MillerPlanetside,3cfevi,Lonny1985,2,Tue Jul 7 17:15:54 2015 UTC,"Interested players, is not the problem here. What is the problem, is that miller made it into a us/them scenario. You can put all the interested players into whatever the hell you like - but at the end of the day, if certain people get their way - those interested players will simply be told ""no""."

I'm sure if we could somehow make a Miller-only-public-vote on who should get to play ALL matches, we'd end up with the outfits that are now pulling out, not primarily those that are left.  We had a selection method that 80% agreed on. Why the fuck couldn't PSB just leave us alone?  You have NO CLUE how happy everyone was after the Briggs Smash.  It was EXHILARATING, EXCITING, it felt like I imagine good drugs feel (never done that crap personally).  Everyone who played in that Smash was feeling ""YEAH, we can totally do this! We've got the right setup for the tournament now!"" and those who didn't play, were happy that we'd won.  And suddenly - conspiracy theory here - someone - a traitor - complains to the PSB admins and we get fucked. Well congratulations Miller traitor and PSB Admins, you've fucked Miller and you've fucked your own tournament as well.  I just can't believe that.

Well to be quite honest, unless Seb decided he doesn't like me anymore, I'll probably get in any Smash, cause there is a lack of players for Air everytime basically.  But then I just do not think that we stand even a remote chance to compete with all those guys gone.  Proof me wrong, then this will be settled once and for all, I will never again say anything about anyone being better than anyone else.  I just highly doubt this will be happening. I'll be surprised what stacked team the casual outfits come up with (and how the PSB admins THEN explain why it's okay), or who comes back from the dead and applies a squad again (RNX? EDIM? 208? NOD? UMVS? ELME? iECP? LCTH? T4NK?), now that the MLG-shitters are out of the picture."

I'm sure if we could somehow make a Miller-only-public-vote on who should get to play ALL matches, we'd end up with the outfits that are now pulling out, not primarily those that are left.

I am sure, everyone who played were happy. And any other miller victory.   Everyone who played in that Smash was feeling ""YEAH, we can totally do this!

I am pretty sure, those who didn't play - were thinking ""cannot wait until i get to play in ServerS.....oh...   you've fucked Miller and you've fucked your own tournament as well.   Tbh, you fucked yourself. Hard. More drama has caused by the friction / divide between different groups. We have not fucked anything up - the only thing we have fucked up, is certain peoples dreams of a ""friends only"" smash.  It is to be noted, miller went into a FRIENDLY match with a competitive mindset.(But hey, casual is not competitive!) With a one-off FC, and a one-off ""stacking"" (other servers words). Just because it happened once, it caused a precedent that those who played - would get to play for miller forever. Its like, if certain people had their way - yeah, it would be a good team.. but its kinda shitty for everyone to have an event - made for everyone, suddenly close on them. Can seem pretty condescending to most outfits."
MillerPlanetside,3cgcgp,Ulysees2010,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:18:23 2015 UTC,"This is way more restrictive than what's in play at the moment and will not please the ""elite"" outfits in the least either."
MillerPlanetside,3cgcgp,Violonc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:18:23 2015 UTC,"This isn't designed to please the elite outfits, it's designed to be a ruleset that can be applied to all servers and create a fair selection for serversmash teams across all servers.  In terms of our server what I would propose to please the MLG fits and keep a place for the more casual players is the Core and the Casual setup.  Assuming the force is 240 strong then 3 ground platoons are Core 1 ground platoon is casual and 1 platoon is reserved for air players.  ANYONE can apply be a core platoon but the core platoon is never more than 15 outfits in strength so there is some space for reserve/dropouts but not a massive over crowding. Core outfits have their own rotation/play selection.  So how do you become a core outfit? First of all you class yourself as a core outfit which puts you on the list. Now the fun part, ssumming we get more than 15 outfits who class themselves as core you whittle the list down with PAL rules scrims on Jaeger but the clever thing here is that outfits pick their challenges at this stage. WASP v INI - INI win, however I reckon WAP v VOGU is a matchup we could win so if I wanted to be core and there was not enough room for me I challenge VOGU to a scrim, we win we get to be the Core outfit and VOGU get to become casual scrubs (at least for as long as it takes VOGU to pick their victims, erm I mean challenge target and get back in the core outfit list) we do this until we have sorted out the core outfits. No one is excluded from being a core outfit, anyone can mount a challenge, all you have to do is win the challenge to become a core outfit - so open to everyone and therefore meets the fairness doctrine.   Final piece for this would be once the dust settles and you have the final 15 outfits that make the core outfits anyone can challenge these outfits for Core status upto 3 weeks before a match. Core outfits are not allowed to refuse a challenge or they forfeit the match and their core status and the outfits concerned have 1 week to arrange and play their challenge. No challenges are possible 2 weeks before a tournament match, that way we can get a settled team with 2 weeks of planning knowing who is taking part from the Core.  The final ground platoon would be the casuals. Anyone can apply for this platoon and it has its's own rotation so if you apply at some point you will get to play, this is open to all and therefore meets the fairness doctrine. Anyone who is in the casual list and wants to is encouraged to challenge outfits in the core list to make sure we really have the best outfits representing us when we play in tournaments.  Final point any friendlies that serversmash arranges then the elite outfits agree to a reversal of the allocations, since they don't care about friendlies and only competative play I think it fair that for friendlies we use them as genuine training tools but the elite outfits have to agree to provide at least 1 platoon of ground players to give the friendly team a solid backbone to work from."
MillerPlanetside,3cgcgp,Violonc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:07:54 2015 UTC,"PSB has repeatedly stated that they acknowledge each server has a different culture and there will not be a ""one size fits all"" selection method. Just imagine for a second the shitfest if the other servers get this imposed on them just because miller can't get their shit together.   Scrims are a bad way to determine this at least if you want a good SS team. While people are vocal about it that like scriming, those who have actually done leadership in SS will tell you it's bad. On top of that it's a lot of overhead that would have to be managed without further drama. Frankly i don't see that happen (well).   All that you brought up has already been brought up, talked about and been either rejected or molded into the selected method."
MillerPlanetside,3cgcgp,BlckJck103,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:27:36 2015 UTC,"Read the doctrine first, it's initial iteration was quite simple, although so broad as to make it almost worthless. It simply said you have to be fair and that before any server approved rules were in place access had to be available to all. The problem was that there was no control over what ""Server rules"" could be.  The 2nd draft was the one that lost the plot completely. It reads like the original one was just amended with new rules that don't make sense practically, and don't follow the spirit of the first.  The first pretty much only concerned itself with sign-ups and creating a fair environment. The later is concerned with rules banning skill-based selection criteria and pushing the reps into decision making roles they did not previously fill.  This can still easily be applied equally, but has three flaws. 1) It's too broad so servers have to fill in gaps. 2) Some of it's rules are plain stupid and not considered, it essentially forces random selecion. 3) It punishes servers that have divisions and problems. Because it's open nature means that the server still needs to reach agreement on many key issues which are left completely open.  That said, I'm all for actual rules, but they need to be carefully considered before their done. It's easy to say ""Smash is open to all"" but that's a terrible rule. What exactly is open, and how do servers adhere to it. The rule needs a clarification: ""Open to all"" entails public announcements, x days notice etc"

MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,Bazino,58,Mon Jul 6 21:01:35 2015 UTC,"So, time for some clarity.  Despite popular belief MCY has not withdrawn from selection.   From the outset we've made clear the conditions under which we'd make ourselves available and as we've also said in the past we don't care about what selection method is used. And if the rules don't allow us to play in the way in which we think we'd help the most then that's cool. We'll quietly bow out of selection and get behind Miller on the stream and when the rules change we'll put ourselves back in the hat.  Which brings me to another point. Frankly, the meetings that are held to decide the selection rules have gotten beyond absurd. The disagreements largely centre around rhetoric and semantics and people are so institutionalised in their arguments that there will never be agreement. Almost all the outfit reps seem to have lost view of the fact that the constant bickering has rendered their very argument moot. They have disillusioned so many people that picking the team is simply a case of choosing everyone who signed up yet still they argue about who to pick and how.........!?  MCY will not be attending any more meetings regarding the Server Smash selection procedure. We'll also be abstaining in any vote. It's a waste of time. However when you've decided how you'll choose the team, and if you want us to play, we'll be available and happy to join any strategy meetings.  P.S. can peeps stop speaking for our outfit............... for like the bazillionth time"
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,EvilJollyT,7,Mon Jul 6 23:08:17 2015 UTC,"This is the exact stance of CSG as well. I was at the meeting yesterday but didn't even vote because I had no idea what was going on anymore through all the irrelevant bullshit. We are just going to sign up, see how much we get to play, see who we are playing with, and do our best."

That is what I remember from the meetings about a year ago at least. when Redhorrn and I were sitting in those meetings. We were wasting our time, because you would sit there for two hours and then finally hear that you were not chosen. No reason to ever be involved in that shit again."
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,FUpennywise,8,Tue Jul 7 07:07:08 2015 UTC,Way to stand up for your Server MCY. I'll try to miss a few rounds next time I see your members.
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,DeadyWalking,6,Tue Jul 7 01:21:22 2015 UTC,"Good. I can confirm for you guys that we are going forward with the Proposal RTiger came up with. Which basically boils down to FC selection, as an FC team, over all 4 tournament matches.    The few limitations are no-outfit plays more than 2 matches in 3. No outfit can bring more than 18 to a game, unless they wish to skip a game to bring a full 24 man squad, as previously discussed.    Specifics are on the document, which is locked to Miller Drive access.    A personal opinion, I feel that currently people are disagreeing for the sake of it. When it comes down to it we have about 1 maybe 2 platoons spare, which means everyone can easily play 1 game. However certain people seem to have decided that it means they can only play one game, and will not be allowed to play more, which is just wrong."

MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,MasherusPrime,22,Mon Jul 6 23:47:33 2015 UTC,"Hello Miller Community, I am normally not writing in this official manner for VIB, but since the emotions are flying high on all sides regarding server smash, I will give it a try. First of all, I want to greet every outfit that is caring for this server. That can be in many different ways it seems.  As you already know VIB dropped out of the serversmash.  It may look like a dickish move, but honestly it isn´t. It is a straight conclusion of facts. As everyone could agree, SS should be about fun.  Fun though, has many variations. For the so called elite outfits, and mostly bored out veterans, SS was the pinnacle of PS2: 2 factions, 1 continent, pure tactics and skill decide on the outcome.   The overstretched word of ""casual"" doesn´t fit in this environment  for most VIB members, especially since the announcement of a tournament. Since we can´t fully stand behind a so/so regulation of this event, we decided to pull out, to not take place for others that actually enjoy this environment.   Writing on behalf most VIB members, and maybe another part of the community, I wish the participants of Miller good luck and especially much fun. We try not to judge you by your definition of fun, so I hope this attitude may be given back. We judge though the inaccuracy of this event, being a noncompetitive competition.  A logical flaw in our books. But this has been discussed hence and forth, and we can´t get to a conclusion, so I won´t go into depth with it.    This post should be no start of a discussion but a statement to eventually calm the tides. Good luck to everyone. VIB is waiting for a straight competition for the time being.  Nuclear on behalf of VIB  Personal thing: I actually didn´t want to post anything on this matter, but since the waves are already coming out, this should be a try to act as a calming wind. Other than that I recommend this post (thanks Mongy): https://www.reddit.com/r/Connery/comments/3bmu50/smash_smash_smash/"
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,Aelaphed,35,Mon Jul 6 22:21:10 2015 UTC,"Look. It seems like a lot of the miller community wants this to be casual, friendly and inclusive event. This is OK for INI. We just don't see a point in participating then, because this is not the kind of event we enjoy playing. So we just decided to make room for people who actually enjoy a pressureless environment."
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,Lonny1985,14,Mon Jul 6 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"Well said.  But to make the culmination of PS2, the proving ground of veterans, the one single place where performing good or bad actually means something for the individual and for the server, a pressureless environment? Its sad.  Its not like we can't play without pressure on live every day."
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,redpoin7,2,Mon Jul 6 22:42:57 2015 UTC,"In many ways I agree with this, but I can't help to feel that this spectacle is simply a protest targeted to ""shitters"" in an attempt to intimidate them by simultaneously pulling out all the good players.  In other words, extortion.  Unfortunately I wasn't present at the meeting and can't really tell what happened, but to an outsider without that information, this course of action seems incredibly childish.  Actually, let me reword that. The whole MYTHOLOGY around this war of opinions is terribly convoluted. Could I possibly get a clear, quantitative answer from anyone on what the selection method is and what it is for other servers, so I could form an opinion on whether we are being shafted or not?"
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,Warmag2,8,Tue Jul 7 09:09:36 2015 UTC,"In many ways I agree with this, but I can't help to feel that this spectacle is simply a protest targeted to ""shitters"" in an attempt to intimidate them by simultaneously pulling out all the good players.   It's not and you were given the exact reasons. Don't speculate without reason or evidence.  Furthermore, if it was a protest, so what. Don't think for a minute you or anyone else has a right to another person or group of peoples time. Stop acting so fucking entitled."
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,INI_Furiosus,2,Tue Jul 7 12:44:33 2015 UTC,"Are you implying all the ""elitefits"" got together and decided to all pull out together? If so this is not true at all. It's simply the case of all us ""elitefits"" know each other well, we talk a lot in banter and playing together or against each other. We know we can rely on each other's abilities. There is a strong trust between us all to know the others can get the job done. But if one of us drops out it means someone less known by them needs to take our place. This does not make us an exclusive group though. We are very open to play with others if they want to.  We play with each other all the time :D"
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,xKILIx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:15:15 2015 UTC,"Well, considering that I'm a member in one of those supposed ""elitefits"" that pulled out and only found out about this right now... no, I don't think I can imply that the decision was made with a community consensus.  However, I'd wager that the leaders of your outfit (and others) have a theory of mind, and as such, might simulate the consequences of such an action.  ...  Anyway, for a mature person who fields power in a community through being an example and respected part of it, policy, this kind of decisions should aim for something and be very calculated, thought-out measures. I'm all for a very competitive server smash, but honestly, what do you actually want to accomplish here? Is the desired outcome that the casulfits field their 250 casuls, fail horribly and become a laughingstock? If yes, why?"
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,Warmag2,7,Tue Jul 7 11:41:14 2015 UTC,It's simply to much work to stay part of Server Smash if we don't enjoy the event to the fullest. Hours and hours of meetings and other preparations just to play a event that is basically just a normal alert.

I do agree with the fact that it's just not worth the hassle, practice ops and preperation we put into this when you know (a part of) your force just isn't ready for this.

However, the powers above have said this would exclude certain outfits from playing therefore it has become an open door policy to whoever signs up with no bias towards picking the best teams available. This makes it therefore a none competitive event as outfits wanting to part take should be selected based on their abilities which. Is that an elitist statement? Some would say yes. However I consider that a fair statement for a competitive event. The fact that others will disagree with that shows it is not a competitive event."

MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,ValorousBob,15,Tue Jul 7 14:55:55 2015 UTC,"PSA: I haven't played this game in god knows how long so I'm not familiar with absolutely everyone in here, nor am I fully up to date with what's been going on with this SS. However since I have been summoned and I'm currently bored, fuck it! Let's read all this and spaff out my opinions anyway! :D  Some time later  Right so... let me get this straight..  Firstly, there's yet another ServerSmash coming up. One with the rules changed by the PSB dudes for the reason to get less notorious outfits to join in. And some of you guys are flipping your shit now because some outfits left to give others the chance? Really? Are you guys that fucking scared of a challenge? Whoever is saying ""b-b-ut we'll get rekt without INI and it's PSB's fault they're not coming :'("" ..... you're a fucking pussy. This is an online game, this is a made up title and this will be forgotten about in a couple of weeks. Pull your fucking pants up and get it done. Even if you're short handed, you can at least still try.  Secondly, You're still bickering about who gets to play? This whole selection bollocks is beyond ridiculous and always has been. However, there is no way around it, honestly. You want to field your best guys, but also give everyone the opportunity to play. It just CAN'T work for both. Pick one and stick to it! Appoint a ""Team Selection man"". Come up with a ""You played last time so can't this time"" table. Whatever the fuck. But at least understand and agree with each other that it can't work for both. This bullshit isn't new and frankly it's astonishing that it's still a problem.  Thirdly, time for a good old dick measuring contest again! You guys are still doing this after all this time? Come on now. This is supposed to be an event about community spirit and banding together with your enemies to take down a common foe! Get over yourselves and (if you can) your egos. That list came from Emerald guys. It's not even accurate.  My favourite comment in this mess is this one: ""Well we might be shitters, but at least we're not quitters.""  Sidenote  You guys still on this game are fucking lucky that there's even anyone else still playing it from what I've heard of the state of the server every day. The community relations in this game are the best I've ever seen and the last thing you want is for people to be fucked off and leave it completely over this bullshit. This is the one place you lot all come together as one community. The one thing that joins you all as friends. Don't be pounding each other's arses over one Smash. It aint worth it.  //llama out"

Simple as that. You will find not a single place on our earth where people have tournaments/fights whatever you call it with a different rule set for each participant.  To showcase how stupid the PSB system is, a real-life example in football.  Germany would only be allowed to field players from all aspects of it's country. They got 3 children, 2 teenager, 2 males who can not play football, 1 woman who can play football, 1 expert in football, 2 old people.  The opponent England has 11 high trained, doped experts on the field.  Does this make sense? No.  Sorry PSB-guys to tell you but your system is awfully stupid. I'm amazed by the fact how you can develop such a stupidly obvious unfair system.  Edit: Please don't get offended by the names in my example. I choose them for no other reason than making my point and not to offend anybody, thanks."
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,StriKejk,10,Mon Jul 6 21:19:00 2015 UTC,such a stupidly obvious unfair system.   B-but it's called Fairness Doctrine...

MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,StriKejk,7,Mon Jul 6 23:19:44 2015 UTC,Did anyone asked the PSB admins why the flying hell every server has his own rules? Every server should have the same rules.   I posted this on one of the PSB Reddit topics as an idea for a selection process.  I'm kind of curious what people think:   Force Commander elected in a vote by the server for each match (it can be the same person every time or from a pool of people) 0-23/0-35/0-47 Utility places (Air Force) + 1 FC place (size determined by amount of match participants) 50% of remaining places picked by Force Commander 50% of remaining places picked by random selection   Selection Rules   Only when the Force Commander has picked his 50% of places can the randomised selection process be done to avoid servers gaming the system to stack outfits (I'd suggest the server reps take charge of this).   Outfits that played in the servers last match are excluded from the random selection process until there are no further outfits available to fill the spaces.   Outfits can enter 1 or 2 squads in the randomisation process.  Selection continues until all places are full so if a situation occurs where only 1 squad placement is left and a 2 squad entry outfit is selected then they are offered the possibility to enter 1 squad of players.  If they decline it then the offer should be passed to the next outfit (back ups should be worked out during the selection process).   In a 240 vs 240 match it would likely look like:   47 players Utility Platoon + 1 FC 96 players/8 squads Picked outfits 96 players/8 squads Random outfits
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,Killahs007,9,Mon Jul 6 23:17:04 2015 UTC,"Does this make sense? No.   No it does not make sense, but for other reasons than you think.   England does not have 11 high trained experts.  :p"

At least, that's the thought behind it.  Admins will be looking for stacking, but the easiest way around it is simply letting the 'worse' outfits play against a server we don't rate much and then the 'elite' outfits against the ones we do.  Then we still comply to the equal access rules but can still stack against the big threats.  Simples."
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,DOTZ0R,5,Mon Jul 6 21:41:01 2015 UTC,"Other servers have to comply to equal access fairness rules though, so we should be facing a similar range of opponent skill.   Actually the answer we got when asking ""Do these rules apply for all servers?"" was ""The selection process of all servers is different, because of different cultures."" so simply put: NO"
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,Brahmax,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:05:15 2015 UTC,The answer is truthfully yes. We let servers pick their own method because like you heard different sizes and cultures. What fits emerald doesn't for Briggs simple as that we can't write a set of rules that will fit for all because everyone has different ideas on what is the best. All the processes are still reviewed by the admins to check that they meet our guides for fairness and feedback is given where needed.
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,StriKejk,2,Tue Jul 7 13:34:51 2015 UTC,"Do you know the ""fairness rule"" everyone has to follow? Here it is:   Servers may organize themselves however they choose within the bounds of equal access for all outfits.   Yep that's it. Every server has a different method to select their force with a lot of bias behind it.   At least, that's the thought behind it.   I know, but the truth it - it is not working so we need to have the same rules in order to make it fair."
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,EagleEyeFoley,5,Mon Jul 6 22:01:03 2015 UTC,"I've read the fairness doctrine thread.  I would disagree with the rule not working.  It's allowing all who sign up for server smash to play, which is PSB's goal.  And in the end every server may have different selection methods but they're still going to be selecting from a range of outfits of all skills and sizes, and they're going to have to balance who plays in which match just are we are.  And the admins are still going to be looking out for issues of stacking and fairness breaches.  I guess the major variable will be how many outfits sign up for each server, but I think this can be rectified by simply getting together to improve rather than trying to cut outfits out of the server smash."
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,DeadyWalking,2,Mon Jul 6 23:06:07 2015 UTC,Sorry PSB-guys to tell you but your system is awfully stupid.

And looking at it from a ""learning"" point of view, I can now understand his decision.  It was just that, it was pretty late last night when I read this, and for some reason, in my sleep-deprived mind, Kosovan's post made him sound really stuck-up to me. As in ""all the MLG outfits have decided not to participate, and we consider ourselves MLG as well, therefor we can't play either.""

MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,Osiris371,2,Tue Jul 7 01:39:13 2015 UTC,"""Need"" is relative. Any I'm not ""people"", but in my personal oppinion: The point is that SS is not an exclusive event for the Topranking Outfits of each server. It's obvious that we would have a better chance of winning if we have stronger outfits as part of our team. And I am concerned because this goes to show that some people care about the community of our server, whilst others care about themselves.  SS is something you do for the Server. If that means playing even though you don't field the strongest team, so be it. If it means not taking part because you think your Outfit isn't ready, so be it. And if you believe to be ready for SS, then you should get the chance to represent your server, no matter if people dislike you, or think your KD is too low."

So what you are saying is:  A) If you are ready and don't play, you're a bad person for not doing your duty to the community. B) If you aren't ready but want to play, it is your right to play and the community just has to be thankful for your contribution.

Bend over backwards to potentially give all servers 48 stack slots , apparently not good enough for those 6 outfits. Say PSB is shackling them. Complain that they want all miller to play, but only best players - then throw a pull out chain because friendfits start to pull out solely because they, as a group - are not getting to make a team solely comprising them. People protest that the 6 outfits are miller, that everyone else isn't - same 6 say they feel like people are saying THEY are not miller. Everyone voting on things i am sure they were not 100% sure what they were voting on. Other outfits getting annoyed at people pulling out, outfits pulling out without even being there - people making long passionate speeches saying they want miller to win, and be wanting to win but at the expense of not allowing other than the 6 to play. Saying that the MLG side is worth 160 players, without room for other outfits to fill the remaining. Outfits / people purely their to cause drama / aggression. People from outfits repping for several outfits at once, non outfit reps present - causing more pressure of certain viewpoints. Decisions made for outfits in seconds. Nobody willing to find common ground, most wanting to carry on as normal - some wanting teamsmash. Everyone wanting to win, compete and have fun, but people only want to do it with certain other people. Nobody sees eye to eye, nobody sees the bigger picture - they only see their own outfit stood out among the masses.   I think their needs to be a ceasefire. A declaration of ""this is not about either/or - but about everyone being involved, but bringing their best""  - that is all i can think of for miller. But hey, i can pretty much think that everyone from miller wants to put their best team forward, but everyone wants to be that best foot and anyone they don't like ain't good enough - on all sides.   Was a fun meeting."
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,Br4gi,3,Tue Jul 7 05:55:07 2015 UTC,"Aren't you in charge? You can change how it's played whenever you want. It isn't like just because a server brings their best doesn't mean that it isn't still a server event.   If you live in Dallas, the Cowboys are still ""your"" team even if you aren't playing. But uh... I guess it isn't that ""competitive."""

MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,Conchubair,3,Tue Jul 7 08:38:03 2015 UTC,"For some reason, Server Smash meetings for Miller tend to be pretty terrible experience. The least we can do is try to make them better, smoother and less cumbersome for participants.   Some proposals regarding this:   Meeting Agenda posted beforehand Information on meetings should be widely available Any proposals or matters need to be discussed beforehand either in privatereddit or elsewhere.  There needs to be a standardized way of bringing proposals to meeting agenda ""Discussion"" parts in these meetings are completely unnecessary for most the part. Discussion regarding selection should happen beforehand, not at the meeting  Speaking power regarding certain sections of agenda should be requested beforehand. Better scrutiny regarding participants, one representative per outfit which needs to be registered beforehand."
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,d3adline,2,Tue Jul 7 07:49:52 2015 UTC,Newsflash:  All those proposals have been used yesterday :p  Didn't help at all.  It was basically a vote of Miller Pr0s vs. PSB Admins + Miller Casuals and the Pr0s lost the vote. So now the PSB Admins and the Casuals get to see a 4 times continent-locked Miller team - how exciting!
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,d3adline,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:55:06 2015 UTC,My comment was not related to the outcome of the meeting but rather how we need to develop a culture where we do not run chaotic +2 hour meetings.
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,ZaltPS2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:05:39 2015 UTC,"I have to wonder why the PSB Admins (in their role as admins) are even at the meetings or had a vote. Unless they are acting as Outfit reps, in which case is not being a PSB admin as well as a SS outfit rep potentially a conflict of interests at least?  Wouldn't the meeting have been about the team and how we were going to arrange it, and thus nothing to do with them until we present them with the team we had chosen for them to decide if it was valid under their rules/guidelines."
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,moha23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:20:28 2015 UTC,"We were there as we knew that some admin decisions would have to be made, and indeed there was."
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,d3adline,7,Tue Jul 7 16:46:47 2015 UTC,"Do you all go to all the other servers SS meetings? Because I imagine that if you actually did there would likely be admin decisions that would need to be made there. And if this isn't the case then, to be honest, what right do you have to appear, uninvited, to the proceedings and start dictating terms on the fly when no other server is getting that sort of thing to deal with in the middle of their meetings? There's either clearly set, considered, and publicised rules that apply to each player-outfit-server that takes part as a whole for all ServerSmashes, or this whole house or cards is going to get very shaky. If there are fixed clear rules, you guys might consider making them a sticky post on the PSB sub and/or making them viewable under the ServerSmash tab on the PSB website.  And frankly, what is the deal with different servers having different rules for the same competition/tournament? As everyone keeps equating this to different servers/customs/cultures as well as to sports, here's one. Does the English football team have different rules during the World Cup than Slovakia, or Germany, or India? Because you can be pretty certain they all have vastly different cultures and customs.  I'm not saying there weren't issues that needed ironing out at the meeting or that people weren't looking to bend the rules, but those rules are awful translucent atm, where ever they are, and they need to apply to everyone taking part. However railroading a meeting, as the tournament admins, isn't exactly fair play."

I don't particularly care if Miller gets called world champion or not, and semantic changes to me in this case (from what I can tell by what PSB admins are saying) are poor word choice, not a change of ethos. I'm definitely not interested in a selection system that intentionally stacks the odds for selection in favour of certain outfits, and I'm always of the view that people should be free to opt out of something rather than be forced out."
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,Br4gi,8,Mon Jul 6 21:09:36 2015 UTC,Nobody would stack the team to increase the chance of his or his outfits chance to play. Stacking the team would increase the chance of Miller not getting rekt .

MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,DOTZ0R,5,Mon Jul 6 22:54:34 2015 UTC,You admins could have spared us all this drama...   By imposing the same selection method to every server.  Like you did for PSBL and Lanesmash. That's what's fair.  And what about the FCs? Who's in? Who's out?
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,Alvahryn,6,Tue Jul 7 08:08:33 2015 UTC,"We play for enjoyment. Sure I would prefer to win but I don't mind really mind losing. I also wouldn't want a team to be called ""Miller"" if it didn't contain an accurate and equal representation (at least of those who wish to take part).  I think there should be clarity on how team selection should be done and it should be applied across all servers.  p.s. ""low"" threat is no doubt accurate but we do our best and would be happy to participate in training in order to better our chances."
MillerPlanetside,3cchvn,Astriania,4,Mon Jul 6 21:19:11 2015 UTC,"We play for enjoyment.    So do I..and so does INI. And I guess so does everyone else. But our views of what 'enjoyment' entails is just different:   Sure I would prefer to win but I don't mind really mind losing.   I play to win. I get that 'enjoyement' out of ace performance and reaching goals set. I do mind losing...,a lot..., but I can deal with it better if I am convinced we all actually gave it 100% all the time. My enjoyment comes for the better part on how well we performed and if we actually managed to reach our pre-defined goal/ objective (and yes, I do see those as two different things).   It's the way I / my brain is wired (I guess).  I can certainly understand that there are a lot of people who say ""I don't really mind losing"", but what just doesn't compute, is how the people who say that also want to participate in a competition where the main objective is ""to win"".    I also wouldn't want a team to be called ""Miller"" if it didn't contain an accurate and equal representation (at least of those who wish to take part).   I'm sorry, but that looks like a Strawman to me. Regardless of the line-up / selection method, they'll always be 100% Miller. You add the 'accurate and equal' as something that HAS to be part of that equation for it to even be considered ""Miller"", but that's just plain wrong.  It's wrong in the same way that the Dutch national soccerteam can't be considered ""Dutch"", because it didn't contain that same 'accurate and equal representation' of the whole Dutch population. Nope! As long as all the soccerplayers are Dutch, the team represents the whole of the Netherlands.   I think there should be clarity on how team selection should be done and it should be applied across all servers.   We agree there. :)   p.s. ""low"" threat is no doubt accurate but we do our best and would be happy to participate in training in order to better our chances.   That's all fine, but I take it you have always (in the past -say- 1,5 years) played 'your best'. You as RPS have your playstyle and methods and that's fine.  But why can't we choose people who 'are best' first and foremost when selecting... and add to that group from there? I'm deliberately not naming outfits  there.   Give Mama Miller 240 of ""her best"" every time we represent her..... she deserves it."

We certainly shouldn't pull out because some outfits don't want to play.  And if what you're posting here is accurate it doesn't say a lot for the community spirit of those outfits that they won't play in a Miller event when they don't get to set it up exactly how they want.  I'd like these people to play because (i) they're good players, (ii) they're good squad play outfits and good communicators, and (iii) they're all part of the Miller community, but it's every outfit's choice whether to propose a squad for SS."

MillerPlanetside,3ce940,satrianivai,3,Tue Jul 7 06:28:37 2015 UTC,"Aside from time and manpower being possible issues, the so-called PSB Fairness Doctrine comes into play here again.  Imagine this: 2CA as an outfit is still alive, and I as the outfit's leader am a bit of an asshole.  The word is in: next SS match is 3 weeks from now. I sign up with a squad of 2CA, yet we don't participate in a LaneSmash prior to the match. A bunch of other outfits HAVE played a LS, and are therefore brought forward as possible candidates for our SS team. Final roster is in, but no 2CA on there.  I of course throw a hissy-fit, and file a complaint with PSB. PSB confronts Miller server reps, Miller server reps confront me. I complain about not being given a fair chance. My outfit was not able to play in a LS because...   There were no more date slots left on Jaeger Nobody wanted to play against us We didn't know about having to play LS first We formed a squad with another outfit, but the other outfit abandoned us , and we didn't have time to find new players (insert more reasons here)   Miller server reps have no proof of anything I'm saying, nor can they 100% guarantee that they have done all in their power to contact me. My word versus theirs, PSB is not able to pick sides, Miller's way is not fully in line with the Fairness Doctrine, current drama happens.  Rinse, repeat...  And that is an example of someone harbouring ill will. It might be possible that an outfit has legit reasons for not being able to play a LS match first (hell, almost all of the ones listed above can actually happen).    EDIT: apparently, a force selection method has been decided on. I expect we'll get some more info about it soon from the reps."

MillerPlanetside,3ce940,SakuraGore,2,Tue Jul 7 11:45:25 2015 UTC,"While it is true that things like this can/should be avoided, and the whole scenario is a little far-fetched... people are still people.  One of the reps, the FC, one of the PL's/SL's, an outfit leader/rep... any one of them might at any point overlook some tiny detail somewhere, or misinterpret a rule, or... Regardless of the wealth of experience they already have.  But it's the little things that can sometimes have big consequences.  And with this Fairness Doctrine in place, 1 player's mistake can impact a whole server (again, worst case scenario here).  So, while I like your idea, I just want to advise caution, and prevent people from just hopping from one bandwagon to another. At least not unless we know that the idea is waterproof, and gets greenlit by PSB."
MillerPlanetside,3ce940,Alexs189,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:59:18 2015 UTC,"I'm still not sold on incorporating the lane smash into this, I think it would just cause even more problems like the example you gave.  I think you could avoid the PSBL's rath by giving as much notice as possible to the Miller community.  Give a months time for anybody interested in participating in the server smash to get all of their shit together and then we start the league. You could even run the league for the next Server Smash season during the current season so that those who didn't make the cut for this season still have something to compete in while all the server smash stuff is going on without them."
MillerPlanetside,3ce940,Bazino,3,Wed Jul 8 03:39:06 2015 UTC,"I had a similar idea with OvO and had drafted a google doc. The problem everyone saw was the time factor. Trying to get these matches organized etc. This would be a good method to keep in mind for the next time. This method forces people to practice and really bring their A game in order to participate. It would work to the advantage of everyone. More practice more pressure improved game play. It is similar to if you want to play on a sports team, you try out for a spot. Having played a lot of basketball for a very competitive school, I felt the heat. It helped make me a better player though and pushed me to increase my skill. This would be great for Miller. Those who can play and do it well would get their deserved spots."
MillerPlanetside,3ce940,Bazino,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:33:49 2015 UTC,"So I've got some ideas on how to make the logistics feasible with this. For these examples we'll assume that I am running the league.  -Having platoon vs platoon matches means less matches if you were to do individual squads entering into the league. I also don't think that squad v squad game play emulates the server smash well so wouldn't be a fair way of building a team.  -The Platoon Leaders are responsible for sorting out their platoons business including business they have with other platoons. So the things a platoon lead would have to sort out would be building and submitting a full roster for their platoon (including reserves), getting their platoon to a match on time and at the correct location, giving out accounts or if necessary convincing his platoon to update their pts and communicating with other platoons to organise suitable match dates, times and bases to fight at.  -Low tolerance rule set. If your platoon is down half a squad at the last minute and all your reserves out getting drunk then tough shit you can play 3.5 vs 4 or forfeit because there isn't the time to fanny around with this stuff.  -Large pool of referees so that I should always have a few people around to referee regardless of when the platoon leads have decided to schedule their matches.  I had more but forgot them : / I have thought of a problem with the platoon leads deciding when to play each other and it depends on how many accounts we could get if we can get any at all. Say we only get 2 platoons worth of accounts, double booking is going to happen which will result in a logistical mess. I guess you could do the booking on a first come first server basis where a platoon has to submit all of their bookings at once and then I look for any double bookings or bookings outside of referee availability and tell them to reschedule those matches.  What's OvO bw?"
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,ArmySlaughterz,14,Mon Jul 6 23:43:19 2015 UTC,"We don't have to prove anything to anyone. Miller decided it wants to treat SS as a non-competitive community event. I'm just going to quote Lonny now.  ""Look. It seems like a lot of the miller community wants this to be casual, friendly and inclusive event. This is OK for INI. We just don't see a point in participating then, because this is not the kind of event we enjoy playing. So we just decided to make room for people who actually enjoy a pressureless environment."" - /u/Lonny1985  https://www.reddit.com/r/MillerPlanetside/comments/3cchvn/so_miller_pulling_out_of_the_server_smash/csu8xdg  So I don't understand why you're throwing a tantrum now."
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,d3adline,2,Mon Jul 6 23:49:25 2015 UTC,"""We just don't see a point in participating then, because this is not the kind of event we enjoy playing."" Well it boils down to the point as to whether or not INI want to win against other servers, doesn't?"
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,KanumMCY,11,Mon Jul 6 23:51:39 2015 UTC,"If INI wants to win but the thought process behind the rest of the team is maximum participation to the detriment of team effectiveness, you can see that it's a recipe for frustration."
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,ScienceGaveMeAHadron,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:58:53 2015 UTC,That's why we need to find the balance.
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,Alexs189,2,Tue Jul 7 00:01:18 2015 UTC,"""So I don't understand why you're throwing a tantrum now."" You think that is what I am doing then you are completely wrong. I am asking the questions which no one seems to be asking. I am not just going to sit back and watch the community destroy itself."
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,ScienceGaveMeAHadron,19,Tue Jul 7 00:59:58 2015 UTC,"Recently the ""elitist"" (I hate that word, we are all Miller and should act like it) have pulled out of the server smash ? Why? Why take the easy way out? Prove yourselves. You think you're better than everyone else ? Prove it. Win the tournament. If you're all better than the others way be a coward and not play? Just because you don't want the ""shitter"" outfits to play? Pure cowardice.   We had this, it was called the Briggs smash. Every one said that those outfits would perform poorly and not work together etc but the opposite was proven.  Anyone could have joined but we got a representation largely from the 'elite' side, there was a very strong performance and we won. We did not beg and cry at people who pulled out we merely asked what their ills were and left it at that.  Now the opposite scenario has happened and said outfits have stated they have little to no interest in the current scenario and have backed out. That's all there is to it.  It is not up to those outfits to play, it is up to the people in charge to go and speak with them if they wish to have them and convince them. Otherwise it will be understood that they think they can perform fine without them, which is fine, and everyone wishes Miller luck.  That is all."
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,Alexs189,2,Tue Jul 7 00:48:47 2015 UTC,"I was one of those people saying that about the Briggs game. I was wrong and am pleased to say It.  Regarding asking people to play. IMO it is entirely up to the outfits in question to put a team in or not. It is their outfit at the end of the day. I said the same thing in private side but there is no harm in saying it here. I'm open to having chats with anyone who wants to, always have been. Hell I even had some good chats with people who I've been debating/arguing with over te last month after the meeting last night :P  But I won't go begging an outfit to play, it is their choice and personally I will respect that."

MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,SniperMonkey94,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:35:58 2015 UTC,"It is not up to those outfits to play, it is up to the people in charge to go and speak with them if they wish to have them and convince them.   What? Not it's not. Server reps and the PSBL staff have issues that are way more important than riding the coattails of primadonna outfits and heeding to their beck and call. I talk with reps from Connery and Emerald and they don't give a flying fuck if an outfit doesn't want to participate. Outfit's step up and participate if they want - it's not up to the PSBL staff and Server Reps to pursue teenage outfits. Grow up man.  Cheers.  (By the way, I support the notion of SS becoming a competitive environment - I'm a member in HIVE on Connery, the platoon whose dick went straight up the middle to Warpgate Briggs in our last match in SS. With that out of the way - there are other fish in the sea, and dozens of other outfits who want in. Control that ego blast!)."
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,SniperMonkey94,5,Tue Jul 7 03:00:54 2015 UTC,"Excuse me but where did I say that the reps or PSB should talk to these outfits? I never said that, I said that the leadership of the server should speak to these outfits (FC) as they are the only people who can actually promise or negotiate.  I cannot convince them, I cannot promise anything and I am not in charge. If you take up the mantle of leadership and value someones contribution then go talk to them and make them feel wanted, that is what being a commander means.  Edit - What's even more hilarious is that 'elite' outfits on your own server did exactly what we did now. You pulled out and did not apply because outfits felt they didn't see eye to eye with commands philosophy. In that case it is up to the commanders to rectify that, if they don't then whatever, maybe they have a plan."
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,SniperMonkey94,9,Tue Jul 7 08:37:11 2015 UTC,"If you treat it as non-competitive then those who originally put their all into it and treated it as a competitive endeavor are going to drop out. That's just the reality of the situation.  The consensus seems to be ""let everyone play and have fun"". So do it, everyone can play, play however you want, but you have to accept that this mentality is going to make other people not want to play at all."
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,StrangeworldEU,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:02:57 2015 UTC,Why can't we have both ? Why can't we fight for Miller? Why can't people have equal access?
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,SniperMonkey94,3,Tue Jul 7 00:05:55 2015 UTC,"We can, but it's clear that the narrative from a lot of people is that they want to keep it open to anyone and everybody.  People want it to  be a community event, not a tournament."
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,StrangeworldEU,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:10:09 2015 UTC,So? An event is still suppose to be won no?
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,Astriania,3,Tue Jul 7 00:12:55 2015 UTC,"Not everybody agrees with that, it seems."
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,SniperMonkey94,2,Tue Jul 7 00:16:15 2015 UTC,"What I honestly find a bit odd, is that Serversmash has never really been the mlg-pro playground the 'elitist' side wanted, yet a lot of them played anyway, tried to win anyway. Despite not getting to pick the best team. why?"
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,VHobel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:52:40 2015 UTC,Partly to do with certain rules being put on only miller and not other servers and the fact that it's now being called a tournament. On my phone ATM so hopefully someone else can go into more detail otherwise I'll do that when I get on my computer later.
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,StrangeworldEU,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:55:02 2015 UTC,"it's now being called a tournament.   It's always been a tournament?  as for the rest, I understand the different rules part, but that doesn't seem to be what people are up in arms about. Like with a lot of these kind of things, I feel like people are just getting more and more upset about rhetoric. Maybe this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc is relevant?"

MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,StrangeworldEU,-1,Tue Jul 7 00:29:50 2015 UTC,Nobody has ever treated Server Smash as 'non-competitive'.
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,Arnolph,9,Tue Jul 7 00:07:54 2015 UTC,Okay
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,StrangeworldEU,8,Tue Jul 7 00:11:54 2015 UTC,A competitive player usually wants to compete. SS is a non-competitive event. Therefore a player with a competitive mindset most likely won't sign up. Simple as that.  And there is nothing wrong with that and has NOTHING to do with dividing the community and all the blabla.
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,Arnolph,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:07:27 2015 UTC,"I still find it odd that they ever signed up, if that's the attitude. I mean, the rhetoric is fine, but what's changed?"

MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,Arnolph,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:12:43 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing is that it's obvious they left due to the debate about this, and not because of a change in policy that (Basically) Just forced us to go back to how we used to do things. They didn't leave when things were as they were back then, only now that there's a huge debacle about it, is the old way suddenly a 'pressureless' environment."

MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,DrConfuzzled,11,Tue Jul 7 00:05:04 2015 UTC,We don't need a reason. We're not playing.
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,BoxDirty,-1,Tue Jul 7 00:08:23 2015 UTC,That just doesn't make sense! Why wouldn't you play? Give the community an answer!
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,mut0mb0,4,Tue Jul 7 00:09:46 2015 UTC,No we don't need a reason mate. You don't need to know why we're not playing.  What the fuck does it matter why? It won't change anything. We're not playing
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,FourthFactioner,4,Tue Jul 7 00:12:37 2015 UTC,"""What the fuck does it matter why?"" Because you are still a part of the community, a part of Miller."
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,FourthFactioner,2,Tue Jul 7 00:14:32 2015 UTC,he just did. If they dont wanna play they dont wanna play.
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,BoxDirty,3,Tue Jul 7 00:12:57 2015 UTC,"That's fine, if they don't want to explain themselves that's fine, but why should we not at least be able to ask them why they have reduced their activity within the community?"
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,FourthFactioner,7,Tue Jul 7 00:15:18 2015 UTC,Yes and you did and then they told you that they weren't going to answer your question so suck it up and move on with your life. People don't owe you an explanation just because you play the same video game on the same server.
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,BoxDirty,7,Tue Jul 7 04:37:21 2015 UTC,"An effort was made as far as I'm aware to come to a compromise, but the fundamental problem is that the 'elitists' and the PSB team just do not see eye to eye. As a result, instead of continuing to moan and complain and cause unrest, the easiest and simplest solution for everyone is for them to just not take part. Otherwise there will just be bad blood before, during and after every server smash."
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,FourthFactioner,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:06:52 2015 UTC,Then why only boycott Server Smash? Why not boycott everything to do with the PSB team?
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,FourthFactioner,5,Tue Jul 7 00:08:42 2015 UTC,"We aren't boycotting anything, why do you think that? We just don't want to play under a certain rule set, we don't have to give you a reason as to why. Simple as that. Leaves more room for the people who do want to, WIN WIN scenario."
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,FourthFactioner,2,Tue Jul 7 00:10:49 2015 UTC,"I thought that you are boycotting because you are not playing. Maybe I have taken it out of proportion a little but that is the first word which I could use in order to be related to the situation. Sorry if I have caused distress or insult, that is not my intention with any of this."
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,SevenSixVS,3,Tue Jul 7 00:22:33 2015 UTC,Because people quite like being able to scrim on Jaeger uninterrupted by randoms. It is an idea I'd support though.
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,KublaiKhagan,2,Tue Jul 7 00:10:50 2015 UTC,Because the outfits that joined PSBL could live with the rules and same for lanesmash i guess but they didnt like Serversmash not that difficult to understand

MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,Definia,8,Tue Jul 7 09:14:34 2015 UTC,"You're not getting it. It doesn't matter if a lane falls or mistakes happen. Nothing matters in this version of Server Smash.  It's not a competitive event, it's a community event like the hunt for snowmans on esamir."

MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,THJ8192,3,Tue Jul 7 00:06:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think you read into what I was saying.  I care about server smash, it's the only thing about PS2 that I'm interested in. It's what happens in an actual match that doesn't matter. You're never going to get outfits banned for failing their lane because the concept of failing doesn't exist within the rules. The PSB staff has made it clear what SS is, if you want to change that you'll have to get new staff or create your own server smash."
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,NijIpaard,5,Tue Jul 7 00:17:33 2015 UTC,create your own server smash.   impossible since they nearly have monopoly on all jaeger acces accounts so that wont ever happen :D

MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,Poleander,8,Tue Jul 7 00:19:03 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily think it destroys the community. It's a rift, sure. But if you don't enjoy doing something you don't get payed for or have any moral obligation to, then you're most likely not gonna do it.  It's a community in a game. People come and go all the time. We're not family or colleagues."
MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,Maelstrome26,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:40:36 2015 UTC,"Then why do we care when people come back and we welcome them ? It is a community because we are one, we are miller.

MillerPlanetside,3cd36a,Maelstrome26,3,Tue Jul 7 00:43:00 2015 UTC,"Because it's a nice thing to do? I didn't say we're robots just because it's a game or the internet.

I believe that any outfits that does end up representing our beautiful server during the serversmash will do their best.  God Bless Miller
MillerPlanetside,3cd3yk,Dasher54,5,Tue Jul 7 00:16:24 2015 UTC,"If you would like to bring up history, I wouldn't think it so simple.  By that I mean Miller then was the server with the more competitive environment and  far more competitive medium size outfits. Most of us in VIB knew Woodman was doomed when our reps agreed to increase the size of the smash because so many Miller outfits wanted in (AFAIK, it was the biggest smash yet), Woodman already had to scrape the barrel to fill a normal roster, to fill the extra big one would be through the bottom of the barrel, and well on the way to bedrock.  Today I would argue that Emerald today has more in common with Miller at the merge smash, than Miller today, make of that what you will."
MillerPlanetside,3cd3yk,parameters,4,Tue Jul 7 01:45:55 2015 UTC,So... blame Woodman for introducing casualness to Miller? ;)

MillerPlanetside,3cabcl,VidiTheCorgi,4,Tue Jul 7 09:56:27 2015 UTC,"Before Briggs match:   New selection method is chosen to all the Force Commander complete control over who plays or not in matches.  This selection method is used for Briggs match. Right before the match, the PSB admins come in to say this selection method violates the fairness doctrine and must be changed for next match.   After the match:   Lots of discussion on what the fairness doctrine is, PSB eventually clarify (https://np.reddit.com/r/PlanetsideBattles/comments/3bnpmt/a_clarification_of_the_fairness_doctrine/) the long and short of it being that every outfit that signs up must be allowed equal access to play, but can be removed if they violate certain rules. Some groups complain that this will not allow Miller to field the best team for the upcoming tournament. A new selection method is proposed allowing the Force Commanders to select the team to play for each match, as long as each outfit that applies plays one game.  Selection is under supervision from the Server Reps (not PSB admins).  In addition outfits can be removed if they fail to train, scrim and get proper numbers. Some groups continue to complain that this means Miller will not be able to choose the best team all the time.  PSB admins come back stating that this is the point of the fairness doctrine and that the sever smash is inclusive of all outfits from a server that wish to play. Further selection methods are proposed but are either shot down by the admins or deemed logistically impossible in the time we have.  Finally the proposed selection method above is rubber-stamped by the admins as approved and complies with the fairness doctrine.   Last week or so:   Some amendments are proposed to the selection method, namely allowing mixed squads of players from different outfits and core group of players that will play every match. Allowing mixed squads of players from different outfits passes. Admins have a discussion on core group proposal and come back with adjustments that are considered to be not what Miller wants.  Amendment doesn't pass. Some groups continue with stating this new proposal will not allow Miller to play with the best team, and have begun pulling out as they either: a) Do not wish to play server smash with who they perceive as 'less good' outfits or b) Do not wish to put effort into something that is inclusive and doesn't allow the server to field only a best team.   I think that should be all the salient points leading to the current massive drama thread.  Edit: I changed the last points as thinking about it, it wasn't fair to the groups pulling out."

What Joshino says is quite right, go see your GP, they'll give you the proper advice. If you think your doctor isn't giving you the correct advice, you are most definitely entitled to a second opinion.  Also, try not to go down the prescription drugs route initially, believe me, they fuck you up if they are not required, like it was in my case. For me, simple counseling was all that was needed, but they also put me on Anti Depressants, which did nothing but cause me trouble."

MillerPlanetside,3c78an,Maelstrome26,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:51:48 2015 UTC,"It depends. My psychiatrist basically recommends them to patients who are struggling with their psychologist so that it makes dealing with it easier. However, I would never recommend just taking anti depressants. They are like a painkiller: It works, but it does nothing to alleviate the source of your pain.  The anti depressants I have been taking are serotine inhibitors, adressing a chemical imbalance in the brain by lowering the intake of serotine. This can have a ""flattening out"" effect, but it tends to help when a lack of serotine in your brain is a major issue preventing you from functioning. For other people, however, the serotine intake becomes too low, thus causing even more problems.   So, basically, I'll repeat the advice that every psychiatrist will give you: Don't take anti depressants without any other mental help. They aren't be all end all, and you don't want to live on them forever."

I was locked away so I wont kill myself, but that's all that really happened in some 8 years of ""therapy"".  Just wanted to say that I find your, call it analysis, too shallow for this topic, but I don't mean any offense.

I pray to Daddy every night before bed, thanking him for the rocket pods I've been shot at. ""Daddy is love"" I say; ""Daddy is life"". LazyTR hears me and calls me a noob. I know he was just jealous of my devotion for Daddy. I called him a Farmer. He banshees me and sends me to go AFKing in the warpgate. I've been farmed now, and my K/D hurts. I stay behind the Esamir warpgate and it's really cold. Suddenly, a warmth is moving towards me. It's Daddy. I am so happy. He whispers into my ear ""This is my Mossy."" He grabs me with his powerful Russian hands and puts me on top of the glowing platform in the middle of the warpgate. I'm ready. I open my Killboard for Daddy. He reks my K/D. It hurts so much, but I do it for Daddy. I can feel my K/D dropping as my death screen shows his Mossy. I push against his Hellfire Rocket Pods. I want to please Daddy. He uses his Mossy horn as he fills my Killboard with his name. LazyTR walks in, Daddy looks him straight in the eyes and says ""It's all MLG now."" Daddy leaves through the warpgate shield bubble. Daddy is love. Daddy is life."

Changing up positions, disengaging fast and decisive, using ""thickets"" (more then one corner between you and the enemy) to limit the angles forcing 1v1 situations.  What you could add as a tip is that the style you where choosing your positionings was more tailored towards the ""one man army"" you where playing there. With a teammate or two you could have chosen a slighty different angle , let them overextend 1/2 to 1 m more into the doorway and then killing them there. Disabling revives and forcing more overextensions thus reducing the ""stacking"" of enemies you created by killing them outside. But everything has its merits and drawbacks..."

MillerPlanetside,3c41qw,BeastmanTR,0,Sat Jul 4 19:26:57 2015 UTC,"You may know this, but in Vegas you need to disable resample for each imported clip and it will get rid off the added blur."

MillerPlanetside,3c41qw,Lonny1985,0,Sat Jul 4 17:00:24 2015 UTC,"This won't fix the blurrieness as i think that the others are right with their vegas recommendation. But try quicksync if you are on an i5 - i7. Use OBS to record to .mp4  20000 - 50000 bitrate , 30 or 60 fps footage. Very good quality - Almost no performance loss as it uses the interal GPU inside the processor.  With an i7 4790k i am able to stream using x264 and record with quicksync at the same time. Fps loss is in the 10 - 15."
MillerPlanetside,3c41qw,TheRTiger,0,Sat Jul 4 18:23:46 2015 UTC,This smart play translates into heavy primary and using every piece of cheese available?
MillerPlanetside,3c41qw,Astriania,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:59:22 2015 UTC,Yes.
MillerPlanetside,3c41qw,ZoundsForsook,3,Sun Jul 5 15:26:08 2015 UTC,I think cover and positioning is often overlooked when people are looking at how good a player is despite it been quite substantial. Probably because there is no numerical way to measure it. I feel like somebody with good positioning can easily beat somebody that is better at aiming but perhaps has poor positioning. It also makes it easier to run away from unfavourable engagements.
MillerPlanetside,3c41qw,Napoleon64,2,Sat Jul 4 16:50:43 2015 UTC,I'd say 70% of winning an engagement is positioning. It's a very important factor.
MillerPlanetside,3c41qw,Napoleon64,0,Sat Jul 4 17:23:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed, very subtle movements can have a big impact on an engagement. I especially despair when I see people 'covering' doorways by standing in them."

MillerPlanetside,3c41qw,BakaneSan,2,Sun Jul 5 20:22:06 2015 UTC,"Good video Darthsebious  An important thing to think about in planetside is that it's client side, and peeking like this not only exposes you as little as possible and only while you're ready to fire but takes advantage of the fact that you'll be able to see the enemy before you update on his screen to be out of cover at all.  It always pays to be the ""aggressor"" in planetside even when defending a building."
MillerPlanetside,3c41qw,BakaneSan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:03:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed, that slight advantage due to 'client side' is quite important a lot of times. Being able to reliably headshot players is another skill which people should be continuously trying to master."

MillerPlanetside,3c234n,SillyNC,2,Sat Jul 4 09:44:42 2015 UTC,This. My input lag was so bad yesterday I couldn't even keep my crosshair on someone that was moving :s
MillerPlanetside,3c234n,cracanut,2,Sat Jul 4 12:05:50 2015 UTC,There is definitely something up! I don't get it all the time however. It comes and goes during play and the ping-o-meter indicates everything to be alright (fo shizzle). You just get that feeling that something is off after a few encounters and it normalizes after a (long) while. Meh.
MillerPlanetside,3c234n,Arnolph,2,Sat Jul 4 11:24:25 2015 UTC,I've been finding its generally worse against the Vanu than the NC.  The amount of dying when clearly round a corner or putting a clip into people's faces and them not even flinching about it is getting a little out of hand.  Not sure if its due to where people are playing from or whatever forcing massive pings.

MillerPlanetside,3c234n,Lucky1TR,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:57:25 2015 UTC,THIS. It feels like 70-80% of the time i get no  hit markers or they are delayed by a second or two. The other 20-30% of the time it's fine though :c

MillerPlanetside,3bx804,Killahs007,8,Thu Jul 2 22:31:22 2015 UTC,"Come on, even though it was hard fighting, TR needs to learn when to utilize prowlers and other vehicles to destroy the zerg sundies before they reach their destinations, or even have better call-outs on orders chat to keep things under control..."
MillerPlanetside,3bx804,CungaLungaa,3,Thu Jul 2 22:41:21 2015 UTC,We were doing that against a zerg coming from canyon... they didnt take brigs... but they had another zerg of 2 platoons coming from howling pass... so yeah we cant be everywhere... in the last 15 minutes VS had a 2+platoon capping unapposed cause NC went YOLO on TR.
MillerPlanetside,3bx804,Killahs007,5,Thu Jul 2 22:49:32 2015 UTC,"I saw what the NC were doing, true, the TR over on the West were always outpopped, but again to my point, if they knew how to position their vehicles they would have at least stalled the enemy advance. I believe it was lack of organisation on the TR side, or not enough of it present on the map at that time..."
MillerPlanetside,3bx804,Aniqiewan,2,Thu Jul 2 22:57:43 2015 UTC,We need more Microsoft Sam on leader chat.   Prowlers r gud to
MillerPlanetside,3bx804,NoOne846,3,Fri Jul 3 05:52:20 2015 UTC,"From what I read, as I wasn't on yesterday, is that it was an Indar alert, VS Southeast, NC Southwest and TR North?  Well.  You know how shit fights get when stuck on regent rock and crossroads? Especially when DIG or KOTV are active it is literally IMPOSSIBLE to push past it.  The base design down there is SHIT, similar to the rest of Indar, but at least there's a few bases you could theoretically take, if you get the right approach on the way.   SO, whenever you have Indar North, YOU WILL BE FUCKED. ANALLY. WITH A CACTUS.  It's been like this ever since the Indar revamp and even before that. How's that any news?"
MillerPlanetside,3bx804,Havetts,7,Fri Jul 3 13:08:47 2015 UTC,"40% TR territory halfway through. VS crushed the hopes and dreams of the NC early in the alert by taking Crossroads, Crown and almost taking Regent Rock and easily killing all the NC pushes towards Crossroads.   Then VS just went on to attack TR and to make them bleed territory either on our side or the NCs side. Didnt hurt that NC had their typical tunnelvision goggles on though."
MillerPlanetside,3bx804,ValorousBob,6,Thu Jul 2 23:01:31 2015 UTC,"Or maybe it's because we (VS leaders) make a concerted effort to get you and NC to fight each other. Every time the NC tried to attack us we shut them down pretty hard, so they just noped the fuck out of there and decided to fight you guys instead. It's the same thing that happened in the Hossin Alert earlier today or yesterday. The NC could only attack VS at Mulac Tech and Genesis Terraforming. Everytime they tried to attack the Tech Plant they'd run into one of my ~science~ sunderers on the A point, and every time they tried to attack Genesis they'd run into Flutty and his minions. Their least bad option was to fight you guys, so they did and we won the Alert even though you had like 40% cont population."
MillerPlanetside,3bx804,Violonc,6,Fri Jul 3 02:31:54 2015 UTC,This is posted on every subreddit from every faction. There are certain dynamics that just happen. They can be regulated with strategy if you actually can execute it but that's rarely the case. If you show an experienced PL the map and pop distribution 40 min left in the alert they can make a good guess what faction is going to win and be right.
MillerPlanetside,3bx804,NoOne846,3,Fri Jul 3 05:38:45 2015 UTC,"it's fucking threeway.  Every faction will ALWAYS feel double teamed, AS THEY ARE ATTACKED BY BOTH TEAMS, oh wait... they are! Of course they are, it's a fucking THREEWAY."
MillerPlanetside,3bx804,HollowStoneVS,5,Fri Jul 3 13:11:04 2015 UTC,"well m8 3 factions it will always be 2v1, yesterday was same for VS with alert on esamir..."

ORBS is a big outfit, got fight DIG for fucking sakes... you can run 2 platoons easily... whats the issue... you can balance the server."

I heard this strategy crap talk a long time ago, even bloddy clausewitz was fucking being queted...  And you know what, as soon as TR managed to match KOTV(DIG on steriods) numbers all the Clausewitz in the world did them no good and they were stomped to the ground.  You got one outfit under one leader that controls many ppl. Thats all there is to it. No skill, no clauswitz no nothing dont be delusinal."
MillerPlanetside,3bx804,Sekaszy,5,Thu Jul 2 23:10:55 2015 UTC,"No, just fucked up.  You put yourself into having most of territory on 1 hour to end. We and NC just for you as any reasonable player would do.  What you should do at that point was to overextend Vanu or NC. To at least get a hope of victory by 1 or 2% in the last minutes of alert .  But instead you chose to defend everything and lose everything.  GG  PS. Chess is literally fucking game m8, i play it with my uncle everytime when we have family meetings."

MillerPlanetside,3bzrym,Alvahryn,2,Fri Jul 3 19:06:30 2015 UTC,"pathetic human being   ""considerate""  You are rude and outraged...because someone might feel offended at the things postet here. I have a great dislike for people like that.  I am not condascending because I don't get it, I'm condascending because I dislike you."
MillerPlanetside,3bzrym,ValorousBob,2,Fri Jul 3 19:17:22 2015 UTC,You really don't get it do you...  Have a nice day.

MillerPlanetside,3bzrym,Osiris371,7,Fri Jul 3 14:19:49 2015 UTC,How can you farm and be casual?  That's like having a sandwich without bread...

MillerPlanetside,3bzrym,duanor,0,Fri Jul 3 19:22:14 2015 UTC,lol I'm just ashamed that my countryman invented something like that.
MillerPlanetside,3bzrym,Havetts,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:35:29 2015 UTC,You can be proud of that thing here though.
MillerPlanetside,3bzrym,EmitzDevil,0,Fri Jul 3 19:44:53 2015 UTC,I like to cut some cheddar and wrap it in ham and make a breadless ham and cheese sandwich (sometimes I even add a little mayo).
MillerPlanetside,3bzrym,PhysicsManUK,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:05:04 2015 UTC,Even filthy casuals can farm when they have ~science~ on their side!

MillerPlanetside,3buptv,Hugohein,3,Thu Jul 2 09:36:26 2015 UTC,/u/Radar_X  because this is actually important.
MillerPlanetside,3buptv,NoOne846,2,Thu Jul 2 13:53:09 2015 UTC,https://np.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/3bural/this_tuesday_30_june_couple_of_kids_fucked/  PromptCritical says that it's been handled. No idea how true that is.
MillerPlanetside,3buptv,bpostal,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:56:41 2015 UTC,"well, from what I read in there, I'm not sure if they can fix it so quickly, what they can do, though, is making damn sure there's somebody on the lookout for them banning them as quickly as possible..."
MillerPlanetside,3buptv,NoOne846,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:03:00 2015 UTC,"somebody on the lookout for them banning them as quickly as possible...   Yep, that's about the only thing they can do. Long term, this is something they'll have to patch but for now this is the best we can look forward to."
MillerPlanetside,3buptv,bpostal,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:05:48 2015 UTC,EDIT: Saw other thread. Hate when people ruin the fun for others :(  Do they say anything as to why they do this kind of thing? I can't see how that is remotely fun...
MillerPlanetside,3buptv,Vaehand,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:49:46 2015 UTC,Me either.
MillerPlanetside,3buptv,uzver,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:10:56 2015 UTC,Apparently they actually first notified the devs about this exploit and are now using it to make them fix it. It was known much earlier to shaql and Roy who probably told SOE about it already. If anything I hope the public statements make DBG take a closer look at this and other similar loopholes.
MillerPlanetside,3buptv,B4rr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:16:32 2015 UTC,remember shaql!

MillerPlanetside,3buptv,adamhstevens,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:50:32 2015 UTC,So they basicly ram vehicles? Can they ram infantry as well?  EDIT:  They are using observer cam with galaxy hitbox.   They can't get inside buildings if their a galaxy.
MillerPlanetside,3buptv,Bulllets,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:25:41 2015 UTC,Observer Cam can clip through everything. The Hitbox is just in relation to ramming and getting hit.
MillerPlanetside,3buptv,THJ8192,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:20:57 2015 UTC,That's odd. I've never seen observer cam go through walls in serversmash. they always used a doorway afaik.
MillerPlanetside,3buptv,Bulllets,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:17:14 2015 UTC,"They occasionally go through walls on stream, but the observer cam seems to tend to bug out in those cases and gets you stuck in a wall, which is why they probably avoid it as much as possible."
