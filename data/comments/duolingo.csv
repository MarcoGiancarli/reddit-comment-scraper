On day one of Glossika, one practices ""My brother and I are very good tennis players"".    I guess you just have to have trust in the developers, that those odd words are there for a reason.  This is merely my guess, but ""moisturizing cream"" may be there to teach you how to form compound words.  ""Elephant"" may have been chosen because it is very similar across the major Germanic and Romance languages, which would allow you to focus less on remembering the word and more on how it's used.  Or maybe they're just trying to keep you entertained so you stick around."
duolingo,3e3jc4,KOTOR_III_CONFIRMED,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:16:23 2015 UTC,"I can get on board with that explanation for the ubiquity of ""elephant"" in the course - it's true that it was useful to have the base of a familiar word to learn the difference between elefant, elefanten, elefantene, elefanter, etc. But I still maintain that arguably the most important animal in Norway's history should have been included in the animals lesson along with fish, moose/elk, dog, cat, bird, mouse, spider, and turtle (another recurring word through the lessons that doesn't have the excuse of being an English cognate - I recently learned skilpadda bruker ikke toaletpapir, or ""the turtle does not use toilet paper"")."

Meh.  It's probably much more complicated than we would believe.

duolingo,3e3jc4,luke51991,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:38:07 2015 UTC,"It completely depends on which user-created course you select, but in each language there is almost always a 'top 1000 words in X language ordered by frequency' course.

""I am going to travel/I have travelled in Russia."" ""My friend is tired."""
duolingo,3e3jc4,Talked10101,4,Wed Jul 22 00:45:40 2015 UTC,"Well, everything in the course is easy to find elsewhere, but the point of Duolingo is to present things in a way conducive to learning. I guess doesn't really matter what order you encounter things since you will eventually learn them if you do the whole course, but sometimes I really do wonder why those who built the course do things like wait until halfway through the whole course to introduce numbers. Maybe it's because I myself teach, but I am just very curious about their pedagogical logic!"
duolingo,3e3jc4,Talked10101,2,Tue Jul 21 21:30:47 2015 UTC,"My guess is that Duo tries to build upon itself with few ""leaps"", so it starts with basic nouns, add to these basic verbs, make basic sentences.

There are lots of other good resources for learning Greek. You could use those to get a headstart.

duolingo,3dz12b,Chemical_Studios,3,Mon Jul 20 22:35:47 2015 UTC,"Technically yes, but broadly speaking that's what an elevenses is.   I mean, breakfast should just be something small which breaks your fast (that fast that you'd had whilst you were sleeping). Elevenses is also, essentially, a small little meal in that same way. Even calling it a meal is excessive, but the amount you eat at your elevenses is roughly equivalent to a small breakfast.   You can view zweites Frühstück as the second course of your breakfast as well, and thereby it would include different things (as breakfast usually consists of cereals and fruits, where as elevenses usually consists of tea and biscuits, and also maybe a little bit of fruit)."

And artifact comes from ars, artis and factum.

Present but hardly seen.  The same with fetid vs foetid, the latter being present in both American and British English, but never a major and common way to spell it.  'Foetus', according to Google Ngram, was the major way of spelling that word in American English until about 1910 when it started to change in favour of 'fetus'. British English had 'foetus' as the major way until 1971, and since then it went vastly in favour for 'fetus'.  Foetid and caetera have never crossed my mind as ways to spell it, and I would've always deemed it as incorrect. Not foetus. Well, I've known for ages that foetus is technically incorrect for historical reasons, but I still continue with it that way.  I think if you present your comment in a less arrogant manner, people wouldn't have taken it the wrong way and be annoyed.

The definitie article (la/le/les) is used when talking about things in general. My french teacher used to say you should use the definite article when you are talking about all [noun] in the world  J'aime ce pain = I like this bread (that I am eating right now)  J'aime le pain = I like bread (in general).  Ces chats sont mignons = These cats (in the picture) are cute.  Les chats sont mignons = (All) cats are cute.  EDIT2: I forgo to mention that the definite article in sigular can also be used when referring to one specific item (but not in combination with verbs that are related to feelings (aimer, adorer, détester...).  Je vendre le chat = I buy the cat  The indefinite article (un/une) in singular is used pretty much the same way as in english.  Je mange une pomme = I eat an apple  The indefinite article in plural doesn't exist in english. It is used when talking about a number of things, but the number of things isn't specifically mentioned. The indefinite article is used only with things that can be counted.  Je mange trois pommes = I eat two apples  Je mange des pommes = I eat (some) apples  ""de la"" is a partitive article. Partitive articles consist of de and a definite article. de+la is de la, de+le gets condensed into du, de+les into des.  Partitive articles get used when talking about things that cannot be counted. Jam is one of these things.   Je mange de la marmelade vs Je mange des pommes  There are certain expressions where no article is needed. These include beaucoup de (much/many), trop de (too much/many),un group de (a group of), but I wouldn't worry about them. You'll probably learn them bit by bit in your Duolingo course.  Beaucoup de pommes = Many apples  Trop de sol = Too much sun  Un group de proffesseurs = a group of teachers  Negation is where things get a bit more complicated, but since you probably haven't learned negation yet and I don't want to confuse you, I'll leave that out  Edit: Formatting"

You can't simply say ""avec confiture"" and not have any identifying articles, so instead you use de la/du/des.  Someone else can probaby explain it better."

duolingo,3dthyx,cunningjames,2,Mon Jul 20 02:39:09 2015 UTC,Here's a relevant thread from the Duolingo discussion forum:  https://www.duolingo.com/comment/9619460  Sounds like they had some trouble with the course structure and (if I'm following correctly) a key contributor wasn't always active. But they're apparently working to address it.
duolingo,3duqve,A-Magyar,5,Sun Jul 19 17:49:20 2015 UTC,"Hi, I am a Mexican Spanish speaker.   Most of the differences between dialect come from regionalisms (e.g. what do you call a straw? I call it a popote, but my friend from DR calls it a sorbeto) and accents. However, those are relatively simple and you'll be able to find them out very quickly if someone either 1) uses a word you don't know or 2) uses a word you don't know in a sense you wouldn't expect. I suspect, however, that this has more to do with how experienced you are. I have been speaking for a good part of my life, so I imagine that for a beginner it is more difficult.   That being said, I grew up speaking and hearing only Mexican Spanish. It hasn't stopped me from understanding and being understood by friends who grew up learning Dominican Spanish, Colombian Spanish, etc. If anything, we pick up on each other's linguistic quirks and learn more Spanish that way. :)  However, I do not think that you will be able to learn a more ""general"" Latin American Spanish. Latin America is a very, very huge place, with tons of different countries and millions of Spanish speakers. I'm pretty sure that Duolingo tries to teach a general Latin American Spanish, but of course, once you start interacting with people on a more informal level, you'll notice that it deviates more and more from what you might expect on Duolingo.   My advice would be to learn whichever dialect you would encounter the most often. For most US-Americans, it will likely be Mexican Spanish -- especially if you're in the Southwest. But there are also other Hispanic groups throughout the US, so YMMV.   As far as learning ""Spanish,"" most places teach Latin American Spanish out of concerns for practicality. Spain-Spanish is not more pure or original, and I don't think there is a particular benefit for seeking out Spain-Spanish (which, of course, varies within Spain itself) unless you're interested in living or working in Spain. But to answer your question, if you learn Mexican Spanish, it's likely that you will learn words or usage of words that only Mexicans will know. But people will be able to use context clues to understand more or less what you mean, or ask for clarification if you use a word they do not understand. And, of course, you likely will sound funny to someone used to a certain accent and vocabulary -- but that's to be expected!   All in all, no matter what you decide learn, you'll be constantly discovering new words and usages as you interact with the language. Spanish is very diverse and, even though I've been speaking it for years, I am always learning new words and regionalisms. Personally, I would learn from the two lists, as it would just expose you to more language and help you learn more words faster.   Just close with an example, this video (which you may have seen) is a demonstration of how hard it can be to learn Spanish. :) ¡Buena suerte!"
duolingo,3duqve,windowtosh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:15:04 2015 UTC,"I have three recommendations for supplementing Duolingo:   Keep a small notebook and write down new unknown words as you discover them. Use that notebook to create flashcards on a phone app like Anki I really like the visual vocabulary deck on this page, but it is more Spain-centric with pila o pileta for kitcken sink instead of bacha like they use here in Argentina. Read children's books in Spanish to reinforce grammar and learn new words. I'm really enjoying Natacha by Luis María Pescetti which is written for 10 year olds. Most of the stories are publicly available on the author's website. I also have El Inventor de Juegos by Pablo De Santis and Detectives en Córdoba by María Brandán Aráoz which are slightly more advanced. These are all Argentine books which use local vocabulary and voseo, which is what I'm looking for."

duolingo,3dp4c7,Mercury-7,13,Sat Jul 18 07:53:52 2015 UTC,"Duolingo and Wikipedia, to rescue indigenous  languages.  By: Julio Sánchez Onofre  Two separate forces but with the same goal; rescue indigenous languages using technology and knowledge based platforms. This route has been undertaken by the educational language learning platform of Duolingo and the collaborative encyclopedia of Wikipedia.  Duolingo on one side has already started working with volunteers and organizations to incorporate the Mayan language into its language catalogue that users can use to learn using their own cellphones.   ""We will start to work on the Mayan language. For me it is a language most important because I am from Guatemala, but we also need to include other small languages as well. If we do good with the volunteers that we have, this project will be done in close to 8 months."" he told the El Economista (The Economist), the co-founder and and director of Duolingo, Luis von Ahn.   With the launch of the Mayan language, this will be the first indigenous Mexican language that will enter such a platform, although arriving past the year's end, Duolingo will start an initiative to save other languages that are also endangered.   ""There, we will have a lot of work to make accommodations with governments and organizations. Many of these indigenous languages are inside of the Americas, but there are some on other sides of the world. There are various languages in the United States of America, there are some in South America, such as Quechua that we would like to have as well."" said Von Ahn.   With this initiative, Duolingo wants to repeat the experience that occurred when they launched the Irish language onto their platform.   ""Already we have three times as much learners of the Irish language than we have of the total population of native Irish speakers. We have an opportunity to multiply four times the amount of speakers and this we hope that saves these endangered languages."" he explained.   Okay I finished translating the article from Spanish to English, I only did the part about Duolingo because I am on mobile and this is really hard to do on an iPhone haha. I hope this helps! I suck at formatting so it will probably look like garbage."

duolingo,3dqshj,insley,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:24:41 2015 UTC,"Hi friend! Lucky for you, I've been learning Greek for the last few years. Full disclosure -- my first experience with Greek was through visiting my husband's family on a tiny island where English/ foreigners isn't readily available. So I picked up a fair amount of conversational Greek (a lot about food and swimming) through just being there. Also, I could read the letters almost automatically since I am a mathematician, and we use greek letters liberally. I just needed to fine tune them to how a greek would say them (i.e. tau is like tahf and beta is vita).   Outside of that, I've picked up some resources. I first used Rosetta Stone which I wouldn't recommend since I am too impatient for it. However, you can do a free trial of it on your mobile phone/tablet to start learning a few words.   Next, I had my sister in law buy me the book she used for her immersion class that she took in Athens (which isn't a bad option if you want some time in Athens, a lot of Germans with Greek heritage do it). I learned a lot from it but it was hard for me to be motivated/ keep up knowing the vocab. This is the book: http://www.amazon.com/Ellinika-Greek-as-foreign-language/dp/B008JFAI1O/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1437446305&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=ellinka+a&pebp=1437446308094&perid=1F7TJ0HPFJJEXRQPAKKH  Now, I frequent /r/greek (which has resources to learn on the side). I also do several memrise courses but none really have good audio.  http://www.memrise.com/course/30298/modern-greek-3/ http://www.memrise.com/course/314/1692-most-important-words-in-greek/ http://www.memrise.com/course/74071/basic-modern-greek/  To answer your questions directly, I have a book and sometimes use it, I mainly do memrise courses and I listen to my mother in law speak Greek to her friends via skype. I also am waiting for duolingo to do the app though, I feel like I'll learn a lot from that."
duolingo,3dqshj,insley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:42:29 2015 UTC,"Also, I don't know if it is an option around you, or if you want to do it, but sometimes Greek Orthodox Churches run Greek language courses."

They're a little silly and dated (from the '90s), but also really effective - I went from total beginner to taking classes at a university in Paris in a study abroad program in a year and a half (well, with a full immersion summer program in between, but still, a year of French in Action got me to pretty much complete technical proficiency). There is a textbook and workbooks that go along with the videos you could buy too, but just watching the videos alone would probably be helpful if you're just wanting to get used to hearing the language spoken. It's good because they speak in a natural way, but it's designed for pedagogical purposes so there's a good amount of repetition, and each word is ""explained"" through context, without ever using English."

Also, Rosetta Stone is not for immersion, it's for learning grammar and vocabulary (which you're probably getting from Duolingo and the books you already have).  Immersion implies that you've reached the point where you know how to form simple sentences and somewhat understand the language (i.e. you got the grammar and now you need the context). If that's the case, movies, children's novels, podcasts, and music are all good options. Btw, use the FRENCH subtitles, not the English; if you use English subs, you'll naturally just read the subtitles instead of trying to understand the language.  If you're not at immersion level, Assimil and Teach Yourself are nice resources. There's also FSI Language Courses which are free resources that wannabe diplomats used in the 1960s. They're a bit difficult to use so you might want to consider holding off on it until you get to A2/B1 (approx. the end of the Duolingo tree)."
duolingo,3dq3yd,TheSixthVisitor,3,Sat Jul 18 15:12:57 2015 UTC,"Immersion implies that you've reached the point where you know how to form simple sentences and somewhat understand the language (i.e. you got the grammar and now you need the context).   Not really! My undergrad used a fully immersive method where English was forbidden in class and in all class materials after the first week. Translation was only ever done in a few select upper-level classes that specifically focused on it. They also run an immersion summer program (which was awesome!) where even total beginners sign a language pledge never to read, listen, or speak English for seven weeks they're there (though the total beginners are allowed some leeway in a ""modified pledge"" for the first week), in and out of class. And if you go to a country knowing nothing of a language and just learn it by having to operate in it, that's an immersion method, too."
duolingo,3dq3yd,textrovert,2,Sat Jul 18 20:57:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that's true. Immersion like that is relatively difficult if you self-learn, though. I've done the ""go to country, get language"" method when I was very young. If you're really lucky, it works, but I got the experience of people just going ""Oh, you don't speak Tagalog/Ilonggo/whatever? Cool, let's just speak English then.""  Even from 5-year-olds."
duolingo,3dq3yd,flublublu,2,Sat Jul 18 22:46:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I got that a lot while I was studying in Paris. The worst was when I'd speak French to someone and they'd speak English back, even when their English was much worse than my French! Having your native language as the global lingua franca is a luxury, but it can also be a disadvantage when you're trying to learn a new one. I did find I was much more likely to get through the day without hearing English in smaller towns and villages than big cities, though.  It's true that it's nice to have a guide when you're doing full immersion, but there are a number of good immersion programs you can easily do on your own - I posted the one I learned from on this thread. As much as I love Duolingo, there really is no better way."

duolingo,3do46c,saleope,6,Fri Jul 17 22:48:24 2015 UTC,I personally consider it your native language the first language you've spoken. Even if you forgot it (a bit). Not sure what the real definition is though. :)

duolingo,3do46c,Fruipit,2,Sat Jul 18 02:06:52 2015 UTC,"Personally I've always considered your ""native"" language(s) to be the language(s) you grew up with, which is why I consider myself a native speaker of both German and English. I don't include languages that you learned after ""growing up"" as part of that, even if your fluency is at native-level, for the simple fact that a certain level of inherent cultural knowledge comes with the experience of growing up with a language. Language and culture are inherently intertwined, and you cant really separate one from the other without losing something along the way.  You simply can't get that same experience of being a part of a culture after reaching adulthood and learning another language. You always end up approaching the experience as an outsider looking in, which results in a completely different experience learning the language.  That being said, I'm young and often wrong, and certainly always open to discussion. These were just my thoughts on the matter."
duolingo,3do46c,Fruipit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:31:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you.  P.S. at first I thought you were Dutch, since you have ""NL"" in your name. :p"
duolingo,3do46c,Fruipit,2,Sat Jul 18 02:41:13 2015 UTC,"There are several titles and varying degrees. You can have your L1, L2, L3 and so on, home language, mother tongue, and foreign language. They depend on a few different factors. I am, for instance, a native English speaker. I speak it with native-like proficiency. My home lanugage is English. My L2 is Chinese, which is also a foreign language. The difference between learning a second language and a foreign language comes down simply to geography. If I were to live in France, learning English, it would be a second language because English is used in France. Mandarin is not used in Australia officially. There are a few more nuances, but that's it, in simple terms.    I personally consider it your native language the first language you've spoken   This is somewhat incorrect – it's correct insofar as you only learn one language as a child. If you begin learning French because you live in France, and then when you're three, move to America and never use French again, you would likely be considered a native English speaker. The critical age period for language learning extends usually until you're about the age of 7, when it becomes more of a learning thing than simple acquisition.  sources: I'm in my second year of a languages and linguistics degree."

duolingo,3dpem4,Proman2520,8,Sat Jul 18 04:19:34 2015 UTC,The percentage completion and expected release date won't mean much for this course because they started with an empty tree. Most courses have a template that get filled in and provide a rough percentage based on how much is left. The Czech team is working on this course from scratch so the only percentage we have is what they give us in their written updates in the incubator. Released in Beta means you can access the course but there will be errors and require users to send reports before most of the major bugs are fixed and it can graduate from Beta. Czech just started so I'd give them at least another 6-8 months more or less depending on their level of commitment.
duolingo,3dpem4,nitrorev,3,Sat Jul 18 05:37:10 2015 UTC,"They just recently announced that they hit the 1% mark. They are nowhere near finished. The way the tree works is that once you begin a segment it shows up on the bar as % completed. While they might have the planning down for a large portion of the course, they most certainly do not have enough to go into beta. The just announced the course like a few weeks ago.   Patience, try memrise or one of the multitude of other free online resources to get you prepared until duolingo announces the Czech course in beta.  To be fair though, I am also antsy as well.

Maybe some stuff you'll understand better with Assimil, and some other stuff will be easier in Duolingo.  I'm not sure it will do much for speaking though, since it's not a human being with whom you speak. But I liked Assimil's approach very much for the description of pronunciation, even if I had the book-only version (no audio or software).

duolingo,3dmjct,Flufflecorns,0,Fri Jul 17 17:57:15 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I s'pose; I just hoped to be helpful.   Just don't stretch yourself thin. The best way to learn a language is through multiple resources, but resources that are constructed as courses may conflict as they teach different things at different points at different paces. If it's an immersion program or something of the sort, I'd say go for it, but if it's another teaching app, I would be cautious. Maybe sample each and see which you prefer. But having two teachers who aren't talking to each other and try to teach you the same things in different ways isn't an efficient way to learn."
duolingo,3dmjct,therealdrag0,2,Fri Jul 17 18:15:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that. I get the impression the program is similar to Duolingo with a little more substance. Apparently there is a passive phase where the student just repeats words and then an active phase where the student listens more intently and translates and tries to create sentences on his/her own. The package is comprised of a book and 4 CDs and takes about 5-6 months.  I haven't had any hands on experience with Assimil and I'm only one week into Duolingo, so it's hard to know whether the two fit together well. But your advice about sampling and avoiding two different types of teaches is good and I'll keep that in mind.  Thanks again!"

I'd like at least some level of feedback regarding how close I was too native speaker level, and I'd really like to be able to challenge my own pronunciation by being able to set the level of correct pronunciation I need to reach in order for the program to let me pass a speaking exercise.  At one point I even just pressed the button to record as it was still saying the text I was supposed to pronounce, and it accepted that recording. This needs work for sure.

duolingo,3dmkra,Beaumark,15,Fri Jul 17 14:18:41 2015 UTC,"Duolingo as a whole is probably not sexist. The problem is that each course has its own smallish team that works on it and creates most of its exercises. There is of course some user input once it's in Beta and gradual changes will happen but the bulk of the course is done by that group. This results in the personality of the team spilling through, which is why you often find the humorous sentences that get posted to this sub (Like this from a few days back).  However, the flipside is that some teams may inject (consciously or not) some negative bias into the examples. It's possible English to Irish has a sexist team or members, and that may be why the lessons feel a bit off to you. I'm not really sure if there's something that can be done about it"
duolingo,3dmkra,Fried_puri,-3,Fri Jul 17 14:34:13 2015 UTC,I read on other sites that the sentences where randomly generated with only some user input. I wasn't aware that the course contributors actually wrote each sentence and question that is asked on the course.

And it's interesting how many of the gendered aspects of the language itself have fallen into disuse in the past decades (you can now use the same article regardless of the gender of the person it describes, which certainly is not the case in French; the terms for ""Mr./Mrs./Ms."" are antiquated and obsolete, etc.) Gotta love those Scandinavian feminist utopias!"

Someone would need to do the math and demonstrate that the sentences are disproportionately generated this way. Anecdotes won't mean much.   Still, an anecdote: I haven't noticed it in my French course. ""Les hommes sont mauvais"" and various derivations are common. The women do seem a little obsessed with their dresses and skirts though and the boys really seem to like apples and walking for some reason. Aside from eating an obscene amount of chocolate, the girls seem too busy reading books and writing letters to engage in frivolous activities."
duolingo,3dmkra,BroderUlf,6,Fri Jul 17 14:42:49 2015 UTC,"Right now it's purely anecdotal and I was just seeing what anyone else had to say on the matter. I mean obviously the computer system itself is not sexist but could it just be that in trying to teach the basics of a language people revert to very simplistic ideas including, but not limited to, women being terrific cooks, little boys eating apples and getting dirty, little girls loving chocolate and, men being engineers and making money for their families."
duolingo,3dmkra,ByrneAfterReading,8,Fri Jul 17 14:45:50 2015 UTC,"in trying to teach the basics of a language people revert to very simplistic ideas including...   You hit the nail on the head. Almost every language book I've seen uses stereotypes as a way to help the learner make associations and avoid confusion. For example, in 5 years of teaching English, I've never seen a book which introduces the word ""nurse"" with a picture of a guy or refers to a nurse as a guy. And to be fair, if I try to mix it up, I'll inevitably have a student who is thrown off by it, so I think the language courses are more a symptom of targeting an averagely mainstream sexist audience than some devious patriarchal plot, but it's annoying all the same.  Not sure how relevant this is to Duolingo, but it's definitely a trend in language learning materials in general."

Of course if you can speak, that opens up the door to any of the other audio courses available as well: Pimsleur, Paul Noble, Michel Thomas, etc. (though none of these are free like Language Transfer is).  Otherwise I'd just go with some native listening material like someone else suggested. Maybe before that you can give Earworms Spanish a try (there's a Spain version and a Latin American version), if you can acquire it. Hint: you can get it on Audible, which is always offering free trials and stuff, and each Audible site (.com, .co.uk, etc.) counts trials/credits/etc. separately (but you can use the same Amazon account)."

In the sense of proficiency, ""fluency"" encompasses a number of related but separable skills:  Reading: the ability to easily read and understand texts written in the language;  Writing: the ability to formulate written texts in the language;  Speaking: the ability to produce speech in the language and be understood by its speakers.  Listening Comprehension: the ability to follow and understand speech in the language;  Reading comprehension: the level of understanding of text/messages.  To me personally, fluency is achieved when the person can read, write, speak and comprehend a language at an advanced rate, understand idioms and nuances, understand common words and language on a daily basis without confusion and be able to figure out what an odd word here and there means through context clues."

duolingo,3d25zz,agileorc,18,Sun Jul 12 22:36:04 2015 UTC,"From what I've discovered, it kind of depends on your native language and the one you're learning. I was in the exact same situation with Spanish that you are, finished the tree, and I've been reading Marquez in Spanish (Cien Años de Soledad). I'm about 75 pages in and it has been getting very progressively easier and more intuitive. But I still have trouble with stuff I probably shouldn't just because the word order is different and there are so many irregular things, I really have to be thinking clearly to do well with Spanish. And listening is still really, really hard. However I sped through the Danish tree, having zero prior exposure to Danish, in 20 days recently to see what I would learn, and it's so similar to English that I can read some (definitely not all) posts on /r/denmark fully accurately. And then I did Ukrainian for a while, got to around 1000 XP, and would still feel like ""lol wtf even is this"" when reviewing old lessons because it was all so incredibly foreign. But for post-Duo, focusing on listening, speaking, and writing are the next steps because you will be pretty decent at reading comprehension. /r/languagelearning has a ton of great resources, both on the sidebar and in posts if you search around a bit."

I've finished my tree and reviewed a bit and I'm at level 14. I think you encounter serious diminishing returns if you keep studying the same material rather than seeking out new material. Duolingo has fewer than 2,000 words, not nearly enough to be fluent, even if you can use all of them without hesitation."

I would suggest looking for another source for vocabulary while you complete your tree.  I would also recommend immersion like the others mention here. Changing the language of everything I use (Phone, Laptop, Games console) improved my reading skills massively. For listening however, watching various shows that are in the language you are learning can help, or even tuning in to radio stations / podcasts in Spanish. And finally for speaking, my recommendation is that you find a language exchange partner.  Having a language exchange partner was the best thing I could have done, there are many friendly people, who can actually become a good friend of yours, that are native in Spanish and are eager to have the ability to speak natively in English. You can talk about things that interest you the most or just have a general conversation. I would recommend doing this process by the apps that are available for mobiles, they give many tools such as calls, corrections from the native speaker with explanations as to why it's wrong and translations for words that you don't know."

Language Transfer has a free Spanish listening course, similar to Pimsleur. It's pretty good for listening to how the language flows together and learning proper pronunciation. Mi Vida Loca has a nice storyline and spits out a ton of vocab for you.  If you have a smartphone, you could always try HelloTalk. It's basically a language exchange app that lets you help somebody out with whatever language they're learning while they help you with the language you're learning.

I'm fluent in Spanish but had very little experience reading or writing my reading was simply at a grade school level.   Luckily an annoying amount of high school Spanish classes fixed that. The teacher used to make us read short stories and articles, where we would answer questions then discuss. If your not that great of a writer or speaker, the continued practice compounds the other areas.  Something I frequently do is get curious about areas of the Spanish speaking world so I go to Wikipedia. Almost always the Spanish version of say Madrid is more detailed and accurate than the English one. Some articles being stubs in English while being plentiful in Spanish. To get better at reading you need to practice with more than the basic sentences that duolingo gives you.  Truthfully people from Spanish speaking countries are very open and approachable. So my recommendation is to look for people that you can speak to  in real life, if you can't look online. I believe there is a Spanish speaking skype group.   Also be aware that some people don't pronounce entire words in Spanish, the way a large amount of people pronounce a word may not be the proper pronunciation."

It's the lingua franca of east Africa with 150+ million speakers, of which 15-50 million are native speakers, and it would be a good non-European addition that doesn't require a whole new alphabet.   Of what's listed, I would choose Arabic. Mandarin seems like the obvious next one since it's the most spoken native language in the world.

Given that the major languages of Europe and the Americas are well covered, and most of the major Asian languages have the challenge of wholly different writing systems, it just seems like an obvious next best choice to me.

ChineseSkill does offer you the option to do both script and pinyin or just pinyin, so maybe it will happen.  But I've seen people say things like ""Until Duolingo offers Chinese it's not a good language site,"" as if that's the only metric that's used.

duolingo,3d09vz,MauriceReeves,3,Sun Jul 12 16:50:19 2015 UTC,"Yes because high schools are the best source for proper language courses.   Nobody writes in pinyin. Or romaji for that matter.

duolingo,3d09vz,Asyx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:41:27 2015 UTC,Everyone types and for the most part texts in pinyin and it switches to characters.  I understand its essential to learn characters if you want to do business or read a book but for day to day conversations pinyin seems a lot more useful.
duolingo,3d09vz,komnenos,3,Mon Jul 13 00:47:56 2015 UTC,"So? You still end up with Chinese characters. You still need to read them. Nobody is suggesting that you learn how to handwrite Chinese characters via duolingo. After all, they don't teach you how Norwegians write ø and æ in cursive either (which I had to figure at some point).  But you don't write in pinyin. You write pinyin, press space and then get the Chinese character. You still need to read Chinese characters to do that. You still need to read Chinese characters to do anything with the language. There's no point in teaching a course exclusively in pinyin or romaji. It just makes no sense since the language is not used that way. Duolingo would just be one of many useless learning tools out there if they did that."
duolingo,3d09vz,Asyx,2,Mon Jul 13 00:55:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that makes much sense for Duolingo though. If you want a purely auditory learning experience, something like Pimsleur is going to do a much better job much faster than Duolingo's system. Duolingo teaches reading and writing (at least, typing), and it's honestly mostly a waste of time if nobody actually uses that script for writing.   The other problem is that learning Chinese without characters gives you a much earlier cut-off point than other languages. It's pretty common to see overseas Chinese who can speak in Chinese okay for daily tasks, but are absolutely unable to communicate any sort of complex idea because the vocabulary needed is built so hugely from the writing system. Chinese makes frequent use of syllabic abbreviation, and Chinese syllables are (essentially) each individual characters. (there are some dialectical exceptions, but in modern standard chinese this is the case) Without knowing the characters, it is extremely difficult to break into this system; words are frequently described as being ""AB; A as in AC, B as in BD"". The thing that makes this especially tricky in Chinese is the huge amount of homophones; say the sound of ""A"" is shared by a few dozen characters (not at all uncommon), and 'AC' is intended to clarify that this is in fact A17. If you don't know the characters, it's very difficult to be able to understand what A17 is, and differentiates it from all of the other A-sound syllables.   Learning Chinese without characters is somewhat akin to learning English without latin or greek vocabulary. It's certainly possible, and may even be helpful for learning to speak faster, but it's going to make it very difficult to get beyond the low-intermediate level and actually make practical use of the language beyond travel."
duolingo,3d09vz,Ifkl,3,Sun Jul 12 21:04:06 2015 UTC,"Whats so bad about using pinyin?  people in China use it all for typing and texting everyday and its easy to tell what the person is talking about(what with tone markers and all).     If you don't know the characters, it's very difficult to be able to understand what A17 is, and differentiates it from all of the other A-sound syllables.   Why?  hundreds of millions of illiterate Chinese peasants got along just fine without knowing the characters and with pinyin you can learn them as well.     Learning Chinese without characters is somewhat akin to learning English without latin or greek vocabulary   Why?  Every character from 人 (rén) to 乡土中国 (Xiāngtǔ zhōngguó) has pinyin, you could just use that instead.    I'm learning Mandarin myself and do like the characters but I wouldn't mind if the Chinese actually did away with the characters all together and did what Korea or Vietnam did."
duolingo,3d09vz,komnenos,2,Sun Jul 12 21:20:19 2015 UTC,"They type in pinyin, which is then converted to Chinese characters. It's also worth noting that there are plenty of typing shortcuts that allow for people who speak in non-standard ways to write standard characters (for example, merging x and sh for people who can't/don't differentiate between them); if you were to eliminate the characters entirely, there would be some confusion on proper pinyin use.  Yes, again, you can do fine in simple conversations without any knowledge of the writing system, but it is very difficult to do much more than talk about the weather and other simple subjects without it. Obviously it's less complicated when you grow up with the language, and have time to pick up all that other vocabulary.  The problem with Chinese is partially that the character system is used to bridge the gap between different languages, and switching to pinyin would make people who don't speak standard Putonghua mandarin even less able to understand and be understood, partially that there is a huge amount of overlap between the syllables. You mention Korean--and Korean does still have some use of Hanja in differentiating words in academic/professional situations, or uses other words entirely for clarity (North Korea, for example, uses no Hanja, but has a large amount of ""Koreafied"" words as well); Korean also has a much richer phonology than Mandarin. The upper bound of used Korean syllables (at least, in Hangul) is a little short of 3000; Mandarin on the other hand only uses around 1200 syllables.   It is possible to use pinyin, but it would lead to frequent confusion, and slow down most readers. Apart from homophones, there's also the issue of collision which is poorly handled (For example, Xian/XiAn/Xi-an/Xi'an, etc.) and would lead to confusion at least in the short term.  The bigger problem, apart from implementing the system well, is the huge cost of switching. Look at how hard it is to see even something as simple as spelling reform in English--now imagine redoing everything in a completely different script. Then there are cultural considerations on top of that. Chinese documents, poems, novels and so on that have survived for hundreds or even thousands of years would go from relatively understandable for anyone with a high school education to completely incomprehensible gibberish. In Korea, Chinese writing was never a tool of the masses--in China, important family records and so on would be kept in Chinese. The entire concept of ""four character idioms"" would be lost, among many other things culturally important to the Chinese. It would also require even more central government strangling of anything not-Putonghua.   Don't get me wrong, I think the system could be greatly streamlined and simplified by using something like the Korean and Japanese systems--a simple syllabic/alphabetic block system for most things, with Hanzi mixed in where necessary for clarity. But simply eliminating Chinese Characters is, while possible, an inelegant solution for the time being."

Or you could just use pinyin to learn the words.  Also as far as dialects are concerned... unless they are from a super hick village 99% of people under 50 are bilingual in Mandarin.  Children have been learning Mandarin in school since the revolution.  Practically every other dialect has been marginalized for quite some time and many are dying out.  I get your point though, its just incredibly frustrating to me as a learner.  I love the language but have found pinyin far far far easier to relate to and use and would have a trouble using it if things changed.  This is the third language I've been taking classes for and unlike Spanish and Latin where I knew the letters and for flash cards I would just need the spanish/latin on one side and the english equivalent on the other side.  For Chinese I need to know the pinyin, english equivalent AND the character.  I also get frustrated how so much of my Chinese study is focused on learning those damn characters, instead of applying my knowledge I have to write each character 40 times.  I've spent many nights writing characters for two or three hours only to find myself too tired to go back and try and make sense of what I wrote.

Speaking is far more useful than reading, at least in my day to day life.  Though I am learning both characters and speaking on a day to day basis I'd find talking much more useful than reading.  three out of her four grandparents were illiterate, I think they would understand if I'm bilingual but can't write too well, and anyways if I know pinyin (which I do) I can still type an essay and transfer it to characters.  I wouldn't shed a tear if the CCP did away with characters."

It got to the point where I just said ""my Taiwanese neighbors taught me"" because anything else just didn't make sense.    I don't hate characters, in fact I think there is a certain charm to them.  However they do rub me the wrong way and when I am memorizing the different words the last thing to stick in my head is how to write a character.    How long have you been learning Mandarin?"
duolingo,3d09vz,komnenos,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:13:28 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what would make it so technically difficult? On the backend, unicode is just unicode, and I'm sure there's third party IME's available just as there are speech engines -- and this can be implemented in the browser, consider Google Translate's IME."
duolingo,3d09vz,BrainDeadUnit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:52:27 2015 UTC,"Because unlike other languages with a single script, Mandarin has three possibilities: traditional, simplified, and pinyin, which means that for each sentence you want to teach in Mandarin you have to have three different representations of it.  This is different from all the languages thus far which have a single sentence in the target language and the myriad of possible translations.    Furthermore, Google Translate aside, there don't appear to be many good TTS libraries available.  They might be able to use Google's but we don't know what that would entail.  Most others are either app-based, or not that good.  So it's hope Google works or record the audio, not a big deal, but still.  While we're discussing audio, tones are hugely important in Mandarin, so they would need to spend some time teaching that.  It's not something they have currently, so it's another piece of software they'd have to build if they want some extra component that does that piece.  Finally, there's nothing in Duo to teach the actual script, like all the characters and how they're written, in both simplified and in traditional.  So that's some additional work.  ChineseSkill has a component to teach it so I imagine it must be somewhat important.   All of the above is a lot of work for Duo to complete in order to accommodate Mandarin.  That's what I mean by technically difficult."
duolingo,3d09vz,MauriceReeves,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:58:20 2015 UTC,"Traditional vs. Simplified: Choose one, maybe add support for the other later. I don't see how this issue is much different from other localizations, such as Brazilian Portuguese  vs. Portuguese. An effective workaround for Pinyin, IMO, would be to include it in popups for word definitions, but otherwise gloss over the topic.  TTS: other languages have already opted to record their own material rather than using a TTS.  Tones: Induction, perhaps with an explanation like Dutch's grammar does. Have the first course include words with same sound, try to throw a few in here and there throughout the course. When 馬 ends up having a different sound and meaning than 嗎, the student will understand the difference. IMO, most Chinese courses put way too much emphasis on tones -- the difficulty isn't understanding different tones = different words, but overriding a lifetime of Tones = sentence-level information.  Writing: Not so important. You bring up ChineseSkill, but FluentU doesn't do any teaching of how to write them. Character recognition, along with an IME and being able to recognize it will satisfy basic literacy needs. If the student is interested in writing, they can opt to do it elsewhere (it's already recognized that Duolingo isn't the place to go if you want to actually speak the language, but great for reading comprehension).  So, IMO, Chinese could just be bolted onto existing Duolingo features, or implemented effectively with minimal changes to Duolingo's software (which, if I'm not mistaken, every language gets a few tweaks behind the scenes anyway). Sure, it might not be a most ideal Chinese course, but I think it'd hold up in quality compared to Duolingo's other courses, and it wouldn't feel like it's sacrificing anything."
duolingo,3d09vz,BrainDeadUnit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:29:21 2015 UTC,"Except traditional vs simplified isn't the same as European vs Brazilian Portuguese.  Those are dialects.  Traditional and Simplified are two different writing systems for the same language.    So if you want to present the sentence ""I have twenty-nine dumplings"" you have write it three times, one for each script type.    Sure they could add the others, and personally I think they should start with Pinyin and then add script later as needed, but if they leave out one or two of the others then people will continue to bitch piss and moan that they're not ""REALLY"" offering Mandarin.  And I said that the TTS isn't as big a hurdle, but it's still something that they'd have to address.  One of the big benefits of TTS is slowing down the speaking so beginners can try to suss out the meaning, and that's one of the hardest parts of Ukranian and Irish: not being able to slow down the words.  And I did some practice this morning where I ran large blocks of Mandarin text through the Google Translate TTS and listened to it.  It's...okay at best.  Some of it was very hard to understand and follow along with, and I had the pinyin in front of me.  As for tones, I know that most people think that tones are super-important and they're scary, which is not totally true, but they're still important enough that I do think they need to be explained and trained a little bit.  Grammar notes is good area to start that, but even still, you'd either want to copy something similar to what the Ukrainian course did with introducing the alphabet, except you'd want to either play the sound, and present the pinyin and have the user guess the correct one (this is similar to what Mindsnacks does) or play the sound and have them pick the character they heard.  Again, not too far off from what exists if you go with option #2 but I think that that's less understandable than #1, which is the direction ChineseSkill went.  I agree on writing.  That can be an afterthought or an addition later, but I really do feel like there's additional technology that needs to be built and added in that doesn't exist yet.  In addition, while we're here, there's an additional consideration:   There are two Standard Chinese: Pǔtōnghuà and Guóyǔ.  They're different in certain ways, and neither match any real regional dialect, so which one do you choose?  Do you choose Beijing dialect instead?  Or maybe choose the Southwestern Mandarin that's spoken in Sichuan, Hubei, etc.  That dialect alone has 200 million speakers and very limited intelligibility with Mandarin, but contains many larger cities in China.  Or maybe Wu Chinese, which is not at all intelligible with Mandarin but is the language of Shanghai, one of the most important cities in China.  Or why do Mandarin at all when Cantonese is the language of the #1, #4, #5, and #8 largest cities in China, as well as Hong Kong?  Those cities make up the larger portion of the Chinese economy and is where people most often travel for business?  And it's also the dialect most spoken in the US and other countries?  I know that people want a Chinese course, and I do too, and I think it would be fun and wonderful, but I think that people underestimate the level of work that is involved both on the technical side and on the cultural side.  And for all we know, they're working on it, but haven't mentioned anything because they don't want to get people's hopes up, or disappoint anyone.  I think that Hindi and Korean will come first, and after that they'll re-evaluate what's involved and what to release next."

duolingo,3d09vz,drift_glass,2,Sun Jul 12 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"Ah, if you have a firm hold of Arabic then Farsi will be a swish. It's Indo-European, the phonology is simple, and there aren't many instances of nasty spelling irregularities - and even the wild cards in phonology, spelling and grammar are all of Arabic extraction.  For these reasons I consider Farsi to be a gateway language to Arabic, rather than vice versa!  You're right regarding the sources. Most of them are for formal written Farsi, which is only useful for official or diplomatic work/study. But there is a slow increase in informal (spoken) Farsi resources, I think, such as Pimsleur and Chai & Conversation."

duolingo,3d09vz,drift_glass,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:20:49 2015 UTC,"I confess, I don't know Arabic beyond the odd thing or two! I have a rough idea how it works though, I think. If you picture how English is at its heart a Germanic language, but with a severe infusion of French after the Norman conquest, then the parallel would be that Persian is an Indo-European language with an infusion of Arabic after the Islamic conquest.   As a result, from knowing Arabic you'll know why 'eshq is love, but why 'ásheq is lover. Or why the verb to speak is harf zadan (from Ar. harafa), but you only conjugate the zadan (I.E.) part. So all those triconsonant roots will be easy and you'll get a heads up on the vocabulary like a French person learning English. But ultimately I think it's easier for an English person to learn French, and that same logic passes over to Persian/Arabic.   I'd love to know Arabic but unfortunately the immediate payoffs for doing so over other languages aren't enough motivate me at this point in time. :/"

The skills progress in the familiar Tree format, and the lessons are very similar to that of Duolingo.   There are tons of flashcard decks on Memrise (which is also a great supplementary resource for almost every language offered by Duolingo). However, I wouldn't recommend diving into a language just by using Memrise, as it doesn't necessarily cover the sentence-forming skills that Duo does so well.

I believe German is similar to Dutch, Swedish, and Norwegian but I'm not really sure, maybe someone else could clear that up.  You mentioned usefulness but that can depend on where you are from. French and German are two of the primary languages spoken across Europe and French is also spoken in some parts of Africa and some parts of Canada. Spanish is spoken in the most number of countries (not most number of speakers though) and is very useful if you're from the USA.  I've also heard that Ukrainian is very similar to Russian so that might be easier for you to learn but I don't know much about those languages either so you might want to look more into that if you're interested.  When considering a new language to learn it's important that you identify why you want to learn a new language. Some people want to connect to their heritage, some want to learn a language to help them in international business (usually French, Mandarin, and German), some people are interested in communicating with more people so they don't choose languages where most people who speak that language also speak English (like several European languages such as Swedish), and there are other reasons people have as well. When you figure out why you are learning a new language, it's easier to decide which language is best to learn and it helps you to stay motivated once you've started also.  It's also important that you're going to enjoy the language you're learning because if you dread practicing, you're never going to get very far.

Every language can be useful. We don't know if language X(put every language on X's place) could be of big use for the person who is learning it one day. I really like Benny Lewis's view on what language should a person learn - link .There are also interesting comments at the end of the blog post.

duolingo,3cz2rj,ReedsAndSerpents,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:13:27 2015 UTC,"ISO 639-1:       ISO 639-1:2002, Codes for the representation of names of languages — Part 1: Alpha-2 code, is the first part of the ISO 639 series of international standards for language codes. Part 1 covers the registration of two-letter codes. There are 136 two-letter codes registered. The registered codes cover the world's major languages.  These codes are a useful international, and formal, shorthand for indicating languages. For example:   Armenian is represented by hy (from the endonym հայերէն, Hayeren) Dutch is represented by nl (from the endonym Nederlands) English is represented by en Esperanto is represented by eo French is represented by fr Georgian is represented by ka (from the endonym ქართული, kartuli) German is represented by de (from the endonym Deutsch) Greek is represented by el (from the endonym ελληνικά, elliniká) Italian is represented by it Japanese is represented by ja (even though its endonym is 日本語, Nihongo) Persian is represented by fa (from the endonym فارسی, farsi) Polish is represented by pl Portuguese is represented by pt Russian is represented by ru Spanish is represented by es (from the endonym español) Swedish is represented by sv (from the endonym svenska) Turkish is represented by tr   Many multilingual web sites—such as Wikipedia—use these codes to prefix URLs of specific language versions of their web sites: for example, en.Wikipedia.org is the English version of Wikipedia. See also IETF language tag. (Two-letter country-specific top-level-domain code suffixes are often different from these language-tag prefixes).  ISO 639, the original standard for language codes, was approved in 1967. It was split into parts, and in 2002 ISO 639-1 became the new revision of the original standard. The last code added was ht, representing Haitian Creole on 2003-02-26. The use of the standard was encouraged by IETF language tags, introduced in RFC 1766 in March 1995, and continued by RFC 3066 from January 2001 and RFC 4646 from September 2006. The current version is RFC 5646 from September 2009. Infoterm (International Information Center for Terminology) is the registration authority for ISO 639-1 codes.  New ISO 639-1 codes are not added if an ISO 639-2 code exists, so systems that use ISO 639-1 and 639-2 codes, with 639-1 codes preferred, do not have to change existing codes.   If an ISO 639-2 code that covers a group of languages is used, it might be overridden for some specific languages by a new ISO 639-1 code.  There is no specification on treatment of macrolanguages (see ISO 639-3).

Say you make up your mind and learn Irish on Duolingo, will you meet any Irish speakers totally randomly in your everyday life without actively looking? Probably not. Does the same go for Esperanto? Yes.   You won't probably meet more than 2-3 speakers of any relatively small language you learn in your life without looking for them, or going to a country or area where it's spoken.   because there is nothing interesting I can read or watch.

Later in the day while making dinner I listen to scientific podcasts in Esperanto, and before going to sleep I watch a couple of Youtube V-logs in Esperanto.   Nothing interesting to read or watch?

Icelandic definitely has a small speaking population, but that doesn't change how many great works are in the Language Including our main sources for Norse mythology like the Eddas, sources for pseudo-historical folk tales that give great insight into Norse life like the Sagas, a vibrant Modern music scene that's given us great bands that sing in their native language like Mammút, Samaris, Árstíðir (Or if you're more into hard rock, Skálmöld )   It's also a language that would be of pretty huge etymological interest to any one who speaks a Germanic language as it's hardly changed for a thousand years and Old Norse was quite influential in English (and to obviously a much greater extend, Scandinavian) History. I think that's plenty of reason to make resources available for it, small number of speakers with high proficiency in English should be irrelevant (Heck the 5 million Danish speakers, which is also relatively small, are better at English than any other non native country and it's still on Duolingo!) Not to mention the language is just straight up Beautiful sounding lol. Anyway point is, get on it Icelanders!"

duolingo,3cocqy,SpaceNavy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:13:34 2015 UTC,"What they usually do is wait until the English for Whatever course is out of beta, and then start the reverse (Whatever for English) course. With English for Japanese getting close to graduating beta, it seems likely that Japanese for English will start relatively soon. I'm guessing maybe September to November to start.  It also helps that they've had to deal with Cyrillic and now Hebrew script inputs. Japanese is probably harder, but part of that work is done."

duolingo,3cocqy,BroderUlf,2,Fri Jul 10 10:14:38 2015 UTC,"Swahili language:       The Swahili language, also known as Kiswahili, is a Bantu language and the first language of the Swahili people. It is a lingua franca of the African Great Lakes region and other parts of Southeast Africa, including Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  The closely related Comorian language, spoken in the Comoros Islands, is sometimes considered a dialect.  Although only around fifteen to fifty million people speak Swahili as their first language,  it is used as a lingua franca in much of Southeast Africa. Estimates of the total number of Swahili speakers vary widely, from 60 million to over 150 million.  Swahili serves as a national or official language of four nations: Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Its dialects are used as official languages in Comoros - Shikomor and Mayotte - Shimaore. It is also one of the official languages of the African Union and East African Community.  A significant fraction of Swahili vocabulary is derived from Arabic through contact with Arabic-speaking Muslim inhabitants of the Swahili Coast.  It has also incorporated German, Portuguese, English, Hindustani and French words into its vocabulary through contact with empire builders, traders and slavers during the past five centuries.

duolingo,3cocqy,Fried_puri,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:31:30 2015 UTC,"Most languages have a slight differentiation between written and spoken language, but the difference between the two in Farsi is more pronounced and no one (outside of news sources and such) speak the standardized formal or written Farsi you'd learn in a classroom.

duolingo,3cocqy,tendeuchen,6,Fri Jul 10 21:15:57 2015 UTC,"I've been waiting for Japanese for 2 or 3 years now. If DuoLingo is worried people won't be able to read or type Japanese, they could've programmed a separate course teaching that by now.  In fact, there are already lots of tutorials on adding keyboards to your computer. Memorizing hiragana and katakana is just a matter of mnemonics. There are even programs about learning Kanji already out, like WaniKani.com!   People with no Japanese knowledge could already start a DuoLingo Japanese course if they merely linked to these resources!!"
duolingo,3cocqy,lungic,2,Thu Jul 9 17:52:14 2015 UTC,Yes. Accepting the input isn't the problem as we can see from the Eng. for Jap. speakers. The problem is the average Joe has no idea how to input Jap. Your idea is great. Just link to resources that teach that little bit and let the course throw you into it.

duolingo,3cocqy,Gramatike,3,Fri Jul 10 07:18:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely Icelandic. You basically get old Norse along with it for free, and since old Norse is like the Latin of Nordic languages it would also help a lot with vocabulary in the mainland Scandinavian languages as well (For example, Horse: ON hestr, IL hestur, NW hest. Earth: jǫrð, jörð, jorden. ) and it's so hard as is to find places to study. There's ""Teach Yourself: complete"", ""colloquial"",  ""Viking language"", and of course Memrsie which are all good but more is always better when it comes to language learning resources."

Earlier this year I decided to get a little more serious and focus mostly on German, with French and Italian as my second priority languages.  (To explain my interest in these three: my ancestry is mainly German, and I'm a big cycling and Fußball fan.)  Then about six weeks ago while I was struggling through German something clicked with me in French -- I just seemed to ""get it"" all of a sudden.  It definitely helps that the amount of French/English cognates is huge.  Moving forward I'm going to bring all of my skills up to 5/5 strength, which shouldn't take long initially as I only have 10-15 that are at 4/5, and nothing lower.  I'm hoping to take the family to France next summer, possibly Montreal this fall, both to take in the history and culture and to immerse myself as much as possible in the language.  I'm also doing my best to read as many French news websites as possible.  Now to get back to German . . ."

duolingo,3cra8r,nikkisa,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:50:55 2015 UTC,And Spanish pronunciation is one of the easiest to learn in my opinion.

duolingo,3cra8r,nikkisa,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:01:29 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the numbers of speakers/level of input have anything to with it? Perhaps Duolingo only has the resources to build speaking elements on its most popular courses, and taking a quick look at the site, Italian is at 9 million, while Irish is only at 830k.  I would definitely supplement Duolingo with other sources anyway, because the automated voice is so unnatural. You can probably find good pronunciations on Forvo?

duolingo,3codzy,Novemberisms,4,Thu Jul 9 14:01:58 2015 UTC,"My translation would be : Ouvre les yeux et vois ce que tu peux avec eux, avant qu'ils ne se ferment pour toujours.  1° toujours means always, pour toujours means forever 2° Ouvre tes yeux isn't wrong at all, but I think les yeux is more common. I might be wrong but I think it works that way in spanish too (Abre los ojos). 3° se : Je ferme les yeux. Les yeux se ferment. 4° don't really know how to explain ne, so I'll just give you similar phrases (I hope it helps) : avant que le soleil ne se couche, avant que je ne parte...

I wish I could turn it off honestly, I feel like I'm not learning the vocab as efficiently because I accidentally skim over the foreign word half the time.  Regarding specifically the questions you're talking about, I think it would be better if the word you're learning was based on, like, conjugating. Like:   Voi leggete un libro. Voi legiamo un libro.

If you really want to go with TV or movies, many people suggest getting a series or two of a TV show you like and working through it. You get the benefit of  the same voices, similar vocab, etc to support your learning. You can get transcripts on the net of the French subs to support your learning, too, for the French dub of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the Simpsons.

duolingo,3ccr6w,TheMicroWorm,2,Tue Jul 7 05:45:48 2015 UTC,"I've heard that higher numbers of cases actually makes it easier - it means that they are more specific and therefore have fewer exceptions.

duolingo,3ccr6w,KOTOR_III_CONFIRMED,5,Tue Jul 7 05:41:10 2015 UTC,Sooo you're saying that German really is the biggest pain in the ass to learn?  I knew it!
duolingo,3ccr6w,ChessedGamon,5,Tue Jul 7 05:47:33 2015 UTC,"I definitely wouldn't say that. What I would say is that German's cases are more ""vague"" because there are only four of them. Each case has a wide variety of functions. In a language with 18 cases, each case is more likely to correspond to a specific preposition in English like ""over"" or ""under."" So instead of saying ""under the table,"" you would be able to say something like ""table-under"" in Hungarian, whereas in German the phrase still looks like ""under ___ table"" and you have to come up with an entirely separate word that completes the idea and is grammatically correct.  It also helps that Hungarian nouns do not have gender. It's one less thing you have to think about when putting the noun phrase together.  But in all honesty, learning the case system in German isn't as complicated as many languages, including the Slavic ones. For example, adjective endings are pretty straightforward in German but not so straightforward in Polish or Russian."

Germans can understand basic English, but basic language can be understood by pointing at things. In all honesty, German is actually not declining and is quite useful. German is learned by a lot of European countries. And is an official language in 4 countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Lichtenstein) and unofficial in upper/northern Italy.   I'd say that German will never be more useless than Czech. It depends on too many factors.   I don't agree with the guy above, but I just don't want you to have the wrong idea and say Czech is objectively more important than German. TBH, Czechs have to be better at English to survive in Europe than Germans. But that's just my opinion :D"

I'm having a much easier time learning French, but that's probably attributed to already knowing a good amount of Portuguese, being an English native speaker, and it being my third language in general.   The thing about learning languages is that at a certain point, the best way to advance your knowledge is to simply use it. Laddering is a good way to ""use"" the language you're trying to develop. I think it's helping my German as much or more than my French. I still tend to translate via English, but it gets a bit quicker and more natural as I move down the tree.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend it. It actually may be easier to learn Portuguese from Spanish, so that you are less likely to confuse the two."

Duolingo is very helpful but as you know it's not enough to achieve a decent level of competency with the language. I made it a goal to spend as little money as possible learning German; you can do it without tutors and without going to Goethe. However, it is more difficult and requires more motivation.   Go to meetup.com and find German speaking groups in your area, preferably ones geared to learners. Search things like craigslist to see if anyone wants to practice with you. Approach German speakers in public if your balls are big enough, speak with waiters/waitresses and so on. Listen to as much German music as possible, and watch the Easy German series on Youtube. Sign up with memrise if you have the discipline. Write your shopping lists in German, try to think to yourself in German, etc.   It's difficult but possible, and if you do it well enough you will be better than the students who learn it at university and school. I got on national German radio being interviewed in a segment about learning foreign languages alone. Bust your ass and anything is possible."

So you completed Duo and any other audio book?  Writing grocery list in German sounds like a good idea. I have started to speak German with myself though. ""Kaffee ist fertig."" ""Mittagessen ist kalt"".... :-P   What else doid you do about conversations?"
duolingo,3c2yc3,Braydonmire,7,Sat Jul 4 09:07:07 2015 UTC,"Another suggestion is that while you are doing all this other stuff, continue to keep doing Duolingo. Keep the trees golden. Duolingo is very good for practicing with the languages. So of course, do what he said, AND keep doing Duolingo."
duolingo,3c2yc3,fietsvrouw,6,Sat Jul 4 09:51:59 2015 UTC,"I was a German professor for 16 years. I do like Duolingo - I have heard from some of my former students that they use it to review and reinforce their German, but if you really want to speak German, you will need to move on and be exposed to German that is not so tightly controlled.  Classes are a good place to start. Check at your local community college and universities for continuing education courses. They are typically offered not for credit and are far usually reasonably priced. That will get you off of the tracks the Duolingo lessons have you on, and will allow you to ask questions you would not know you have if you were not in a more free-form learning environment. You will meet other people who have the same goal, and will get experience in open conversation. Ideally, the teacher will be speaking German throughout, although I am sure that varies a bit more in classes offered for non-credit seeking students. You may also be able to use that as a spring board to connect with informal gatherings like a Kaffeeklatch.   Start taking your self-study to less tightly controlled sources as well. I really recommend reading German, even if you do not understand every word. News sources are a great way to start because you basically  know what is going on in the major news, and that background knowledge can help you pick up more. Focus more in international and social stories, health etc. Der Spiegel is a good news magazine with an educated language level, and I usually ask students to read shorter articles from there, but there are many others. Just google ""Nachrichten Deutschland""  Read in German - you can often get German books at second hand bookstores very inexpensively, or do what many of my students do - get books you love in German from Amazon. It does not matter at all if it is translated out of an English source. Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings were both very, very popular. When I was first learning German, I read a lot of Stephen King because his books are full of dialogue, often in an ""everyday speech"" style, and that really helped my conversational vocabulary and familiarity with slang.  Video games offered in German are a great way to practice. I taught a conversational German course in World of Warcraft on a German speaking server. It was amazing how quickly students felt comfortable communicating in German even in class. because games tie together real needs with the target language. Everquest 2 is free to play and has a completely German interface and German servers available from anywhere in the world. Get in a guild - you will have to communicate by typing at the very least, and many of them use voice chat - you can make lifelong friends in German speaking countries that way.  Likewise, start watching German video - news video for example, and German movies. Try watching a German movie with the subtitles on, and then with the subtitles off - your familiarity with the story and even some recall of the dialogue can help support you in picking out what is going on.   All of that passive intake in both modalities, reading and listening, really promotes acquisition.  Finally, I recommend that you do some writing. Journal in German - look up words you don't know and check gender whenever you are not sure. That means that your initial entries may be a bit short, but you will be surprised how quickly you find that you use the same core vocabulary. Write down what you dream at night to really push what you have to say and describe. Part of having an extensive vocabulary is about just learning new words by looking things up.  So in short, hit all 4 modalities - read, speak, listen and write. Do a little every day. Some of the more recent research into second language acquisition suggests that the conventional wisdom about not being able to learn language as well once you are no longer a child is more a reflection of the fact that as a child, you spend all day practicing language with no ""better"" language to fall back on when you get frustrated. Other than a few deep parameters relating to word order that have been set in an adult learner, your brain still absorbs language through exposure (acquisition, not learning), so focus on maximizing that exposure in the 4 modalities and get a little out of your comfort zone.

You have to be willing to do everything possible if you're serious about your goal, so I'd be asking the organiser of the meetup group what the deal is, and if that falls through, starting up your own group. You can also try going to the websites of local unis and finding out if they have German clubs. I've met a few cool people and bolstered my German through that. Put your own ad on craigslist, because why not. Check your local libraries, sometimes they have language learning groups. At the end of the day if you want to get good at spoken German, you have to speak it, preferably with advanced/native speakers.   I haven't listened to any audio books, but I've finished the German Duolingo course. I'm a huge fan of Easy German on Youtube, where they interview people on the streets (there are also German and English subtitles). I'm fortunate enough to have an event called Mundo Lingo where hundreds of people of all nationalities meet up at a venue (with alcohol of course!) and practice their languages. I go every Wednesday night, it's awesome. I have some friends in Germany I used to Skype with every so often, that was also helpful. That's what I do to improve my conversational skills. Try a lot of methods, find the ones you like, and go from there."

duolingo,3c2yc3,Cigil,2,Sat Jul 4 18:43:21 2015 UTC,"I would consider doing the Goethe-Institut route to start, and moving on to Private tutors, while being immersed in German language listening and reading as much as possible the whole while (American films with German dubs, also try Deutschland 83, and Stromberg is good too.  I personally have taken 4 years in high school of German, and 3 months of intensive language learning in Vienna. I also lived in Germany for a year, and from my experiences I learned a couple things. From no German -> End of my time in Vienna, I learned all of the grammar and cases that I know now. From my year living in Germany, my speaking went from little to near fluent. I honestly didn't learn much grammar at all during this time, and in cases went backwards because I picked up so much dialect and diverted from Hochdeutsch. I'm saying this because I think the method I used was very effective, but of course had some drawbacks. I learned German first and then learned how to speak it organically (past a very basic level, of course my courses taught me speaking). This was good because I had a foundation. You can combine the two, but a friend of mine who was with me in Germany for a year tried to do both at the same time and had a really hard time being conversational at all for the first 6 months. It was a lot easier for me because I already understood what people were saying and could read menus and read the newspaper, which meant that I was a lot further ahead of the game and could bring the conversation past hello and nice to meet you, where are you from, etc.  I think A1 will be a breeze and A2 will be a real challenge for you. Conquer that challenge with this course, and then see what happens. With regard to whether or not you can learn A1 and A2 by December, it wholly depends on your dedication and the pace of the course/how many hours a day, etc. A1 is doable from scratch in a month with 3 hour lessons a day 5 days a week + homework, but I really doubt that this Goethe-Institute course is that intense. My bet would be that A1 + A2 by December is doable if you supplement it with other learning opportunities and the course is set up like that, but I doubt they would combine A1 + A2 into one ""course"". You might want to jump into A2 and play catch-up if you think that A1 is too easy, but that can be hard too and be a negative experience because you're playing catchup the whole time. A private tutor in my opinion would depend on who but would seem like the best bet for getting your speaking to the next level. My experience with language learning skyping stuff is that it's awkward and hard to keep a natural flow of conversation going, but to each their own.   There are opportunities you have that, if you are serious about learning German, you should be using on a day to day basis. I'm maintaining my german right now, and it's hard, but there are a few things I do on an almost daily basis.   Memrise vocabulary is great for pounding vocab into your head. A few lessons on Duolingo to keep the streak going and refresh your memory (I find Duolingo great for keeping the gender of nouns fresh). Watching tons of movies and tv shows in German (without subtitles is better because you'll be handicapped down the line, i.e. won't have subtitles in life. Plus it's really limiting what you watch if you only watch things with subtitles, harder to find). I also read German literature. I've had my phone and computer in German for 2 years now. I really like the grocery list in German idea. Writing out journal entries in German is great, too. I write papers in German as well sometimes and send them to friends who can correct them. If you can find someone like that that would be great, and I'm sure someone in the reddit community would be willing to help. (i would be as well although native speakers are always better and I don't claim to be the best German writer).  All these things are just little complements to your learning! Nothing by itself is enough. I also know where you're coming from, finding Germans in public stateside is not easy, and if it happensn that's great, but I personally have found that, when stateside, Stammtisch and other meetings specifically for German speaking are the best bet you can find, because everyone there has similar goals! It's not practical to rely on running into German speakers or going to German restaurants as a real sustainable part of your language learning.   Tl;Dr Private tutor might be your best bet but there are plenty of learning opportunities you can do on your own/through a class before you are going to be able to get the most out of private tutor sessions."
duolingo,3c2yc3,Cigil,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:26:57 2015 UTC,The institute doesn't have a combined course. Each level is a 15 months course.  You are correct that I would just be catching up the whole time if I join A2 and would get bored if I join A1. I think A1 is more about cramming all the rules. When it is essen or esse etc. There might be some logic which I don't know about at this point of time but still it seems A1 is a lot of cramming?
duolingo,3c2yc3,LanguageNick,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:20:12 2015 UTC,"Yes A1 is a lot of ""cramming"", but it's necessary stuff that you have to learn in order to have the verb endings feel natural in your conversational and written German. The stuff you learn in A1 isn't hard by any means, but getting the motivation to learn that part is really hard, because you keep wanting to move past it and it seems so easy!   15 months for each level? A1 is 15 months, etc? That is really long. Is it only night classes?"

I might try to talk to the Institut and tell them your situation. My guess would be that they would tell you to take A1.   I wish I could be more helpful, but if you don't want to wait I would really recommend that you take A1. You'll move along quickly, and being ahead of the game is ALWAYS good in language learning. The other option would be to skip this round of Goethe, take A2 in the spring once you've done A1 on your own, and then move on to B1 next summer. it's a bit slower, but you would be making sure that your gaps in learning are lower."
duolingo,3c2yc3,Alsterwasser,2,Sun Jul 5 16:42:15 2015 UTC,"What exactly are you worried about in terms of ""trust issues"" with a private tutor? That the private tutor isn't actually qualified? That the private tutor will rip you off? That there is no guarantee?  I would recommend going with a private tutor. One key, though, is to be ready to switch/end the relationship with the tutor the moment you feel they are not helping you. I have heard stories of people staying with the same private tutor, even though they weren't helping the student and the student was unhappy with them. Of course, you need to be respectful and polite, but you are the boss and you are paying them! I would also recommend a teacher that focuses on communication as quickly as possible, not just grammar rules. For at least part of the class, you should be speaking to them in German without any interruptions for corrections, just to get used to actually using the language."

This status continued to grow into the 18th century, by which time French was the language of European courts and diplomacy. The importance of French began to wane in the early 20th century, when the rise of the English-speaking United States to superpower status eroded its place as the language of trade, science and diplomacy.

duolingo,3bwynk,Gehalgod,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:34:32 2015 UTC,"German declension:       German declension is the paradigm that German uses to define all the ways articles, adjectives and sometimes nouns can change their form to reflect their role in the sentence: subject, object, etc. Declension allows speakers to mark a difference between subjects, direct objects, indirect objects and possessives by changing the form of the word—and/or its associated article—instead of indicating this meaning through word order or prepositions (e.g. English, Spanish, French). As a result, German can take a much more fluid approach to word order without the meaning being obscured. In English, a simple sentence must be written in strict word order (ex. John sees Mary). This sentence cannot be expressed in any other word order than how it is written here without substituting one word with a synonym. A transliteration of the same sentence from German to English would appear rather different (ex. John-subject sees Mary-directobject) and can be expressed with a variety of word order (ex. Mary-directobject sees John-subject) with little or no change in meaning.

duolingo,3bwynk,GrenzePsychiater,3,Fri Jul 3 11:48:15 2015 UTC,"No particular lesson yet, but I have a very hard time using ce/cet/cette (despite knowing the theory) and a very hard time remembering the direct object and indirect object pronouns (lui, leur, le la) for some reason.  And I don't think I quite understand when to use celui/ceux/celle/celles.  You might think I'm in the beginning of the tree, but nope. I'm half-way through and learning imperfect now. I've also memorized all nouns, verbs and adjectives from the tree through Memrise (including lessons I haven't done yet), and can almost always conjugate correctly in the present. So... I think I'm doing pretty well. But for some reason the above, adverbs and prepositions are killing me. For some reason I haven't put the adverbs and prepositions into Anki yet. Probably should do that..."
duolingo,3bwynk,Asyx,3,Thu Jul 2 22:42:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I had so much trouble with exactly the same stuff at exactly the same point in my tree. I finished my tree maybe a week or so ago and went back to the Celle/Celui/etc. stuff and the prepositions and adverbs to brush up and somehow everything had absorbed itself in to my brain.  So yeah, don't worry too much about it. Revise it of course, but don't kill yourself over it because it'll make sense eventually."
duolingo,3bwynk,proximacentauri77,3,Fri Jul 3 02:05:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm you know you just made me rethink what celui/celle/ceux/celles means in French... I guess it's something like ""the one/ones""...?"
duolingo,3bwynk,Teotwawki69,3,Fri Jul 3 02:31:29 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine had that problem. When I explained to her that they're basically 'ce' combined with one of the disjunctive pronouns 'lui', 'elle', 'eux', and 'elles' to give the gender and number of the thing or things you're referring to, it clicked with her."
duolingo,3bwynk,Brotigone,2,Fri Jul 3 09:08:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear you're having a tough time on your course! :( It does sound like you're on the right tracks though, if you can conjugate in present and know all the vocab. :) Hopefully your brain is taking it all in subconsciously and one day it will come naturally."
duolingo,3bwynk,PanningForSalt,3,Fri Jul 3 07:57:11 2015 UTC,"Every time I see a question about cases, I'm just happy that I'm a German native speaker. Even though cases in other languages are confusing, I'm at least used to the concept. I'm studying Japanese at the moment and even though some particles (which are doing the same as cases. Giving nouns a function) are just weird and are not used in a way you'd assume or make semi-confusing distinctions (ni and e are both particles used for direction like going to something but only ni can also be used in a more abstract way whilst e is always physical movement), I have very little problems getting used to using them instead of sentence structure.  Depending on what languages you're into, it's like having the rolled R in your native language. It's so common that chances are high that you will have an advantage just by being able to produce that sound flawlessly. Similarly, cases or similar construct are quite common though probably not as common as the rolled r."
duolingo,3bwynk,chumly143,2,Fri Jul 3 00:14:11 2015 UTC,"I didn't think learning the cases was too difficult. Now prepositions, on the other hand...I had to get out of the mindset of translating to English first before I could get a hold of figuring out which preposition meant what."

duolingo,3bxhf1,BoogerEater101,10,Fri Jul 3 00:02:07 2015 UTC,I think you should spend less time with Duolingo and add some other forms of practice. Memrise is a really good site you can use to focus on vocab. Or try lang8 and start writing sentences in Spanish.
duolingo,3bxhf1,superfantastic1,2,Fri Jul 3 02:00:44 2015 UTC,Are these apps as well? One thing I love about Duolingo is being able to do quick exercises on my phone while on the go or waiting around.

duolingo,3bxhf1,Lizbein,6,Sun Jul 5 13:09:04 2015 UTC,"Good on you for being so into it, but consistency and perseverance is way more important than racking up XP and spending lingots. 10 points a day for 100 days will help you learn and retain better than 1,000 XP in one day. And even if you have nothing going on, committing to 2-3 hours a day is a pretty lofty goal."
duolingo,3bxhf1,camestros,5,Fri Jul 3 03:56:38 2015 UTC,"Some pretty sound advice from the others.    Don't overload in the beginning, just stick to a simple points or new acquisition goal. There will come a point, ~40% through, when you will acquire skills at a slower rate and it will otherwise become a disheartening endeavor when(not if) you hit a wall. Don't let it become a counterproductive exercise of single point repetition for the sake of finishing a task.    Unless you're shipping out in 60 days Memrise, etc shouldn't be used until you've passed the the 75% mark on DL. These are fine and often wonderful additions to a repertoire, but are often times hastily assembled at the cost of precision. If you're a native English speaker, before using memrise,  you should be able to understand and even predict gender articles as they are sometimes omitted in the user generated study aids.    I would purchase the timed review and extended test(you won't need the test for a while).   Finally, nursery rhymes and tongue twisters in the target language. Even if you don't understand every word, they are easy to remember and recite allowing for rapid process memory development(instinctively moving your tongue, jaw, lips, diaphragm, etc in non-native rhythms)      Edit-format"
duolingo,3bxhf1,lurningstough,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:22:11 2015 UTC,"I know the spanish duolingo course on memrise forces users to use accents and gender articles. Its a shame that some of the more popular courses don't do this as well. Anyway, I prefer memrise over the flashcards feature on duolingo or even reviewing a lesson for vocabulary. SRS is a good way to practice newer words. I also use Anki which I write flashcards in much more detail"
duolingo,3bxhf1,superfantastic1,2,Fri Jul 3 06:02:03 2015 UTC,"Anki is a good one. I forgot I even had it on my phone, but definitely a good way to build your own reference catalog.   I just think OP's gusto, not unlike many of us when starting out, might lead to a diffused effort.

duolingo,3bxhf1,lurningstough,2,Fri Jul 3 06:26:45 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty new as well. One thi I found works for me is focusing more on refreshing on things I've already learned as opposed to completing the tree. I still complete the tree obviously, but every time I practice the ones I'm not good at yet (there's a button for that on the ios app at least), I end up learning something new. Once it gets too easy then I'll finish more of the tree."

duolingo,3bxhf1,NewYorch,2,Fri Jul 3 05:09:08 2015 UTC,"Pace yourself.  The faster you blaze through a skill tree, the faster you'll lose what you've learned.  So every day make sure you've practiced what you learned the previous day before moving on.  My recommendation: get an introductory Spanish reader and a Spanish workbook to supplement what you learn with Duo. It's what I've done with French (I learned Spanish in school) and now I can read most articles in French-language papers, although understanding spoken French is another thing entirely."
duolingo,3bxhf1,firerosearien,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:18:01 2015 UTC,"Practice outside of duolingo too. I try and translate my daily activities, and speak spanish to myself at times. Even if you just know a few words, it does help. So far my favorite has been playing apps on my tablet and saying what I can, or reciting phone numbers in spanish.  Whatever language you are learning try and incorporate it into your daily routine and try and form sentences in your own. Another tip, there are several apps and websites that allow you to practice with a native speaker. It can be pretty intimidating at first, but it can be fun too. Good luck!"
duolingo,3bxhf1,Brewrites,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:46:22 2015 UTC,"People often complain that DuoLingo doesn't teach you what a language sounds like or how to speak it or hear it, only how to read and write it.  I recommend listening to Spanish talk radio, especially on online radio stations.  Even if you have a really tough time understanding a word of it, it's still a good idea. Your subconscious will learn how words run together, the general pace and accent of the language, and what words commonly follow other words.  People forget there's a difference between understanding a concept, memorizing a concept, and being able to use a concept without even thinking.   It might take a ton of energy trying to figure out how to construct your sentence, then trying to figure the grammar of the response. If you have a large subconscious database of grammar, you can do that without even thinking about it, like you do in your first language."

Even people who are experienced in language learning and go through immersion in their target country can't hold a basic conversation after a week. You are fine. Keep trying and keep speaking. After a month or so, you will probably be able to hold a basic conversation and you will look back at this post and laugh.

duolingo,3brsav,officerkondo,8,Wed Jul 1 17:47:17 2015 UTC,"So I've heard all about how you should get started speaking with a native speaker right away.   Whoever said this (and a lot of people say it) gave you bad advice. You found out why. The reason is that when you are just starting out, you barely know any words so (1) you have very little to say and (2) you will understand very little of what is said to you.  So, the way you ""combat this"" is to keep studying and wait until you have a decent vocabulary and command of the language before attempting to have conversation."
duolingo,3brsav,ReedsAndSerpents,2,Thu Jul 2 16:58:43 2015 UTC,"It's not the worst advice, but it needs to be modified a little bit. A native speaker is indeed the best possible person to learn from, but there's a catch: they have to speak to you in words they know you'll understand, i.e. extremely simple ones the way they would a child. This is how everyone learned their native language in the first place. You'd say, ""I wants grape!"" and your parents would gently correct ""We say 'I want grapes'. You wouldn't speak adult level German for instance to an infant and expect it to understand you, it's relatively the same for an adult with almost no German."
duolingo,3brsav,officerkondo,3,Fri Jul 3 00:33:16 2015 UTC,"It's not the worst advice   ""Speak from Day One"" is pretty bad advice, for the reasons I mentioned in my original response. Very small vocabulary means you can say very little and understand very little.   they have to speak to you in words they know you'll understand   Maybe native speakers don't want to speak baby talk to an adult. Do you? I don't.   This is how everyone learned their native language in the first place. You'd say, ""I wants grape!"" and your parents would gently correct ""We say 'I want grapes'.    Why do you think that adults should learn a second language as a baby acquires its first language? On this point in particular, strangers have a lot less invested in talking about how your shirt is blue and you like corn than your parents were in teaching you your native language.  I frankly find it rude to try to have a conversation with someone in a language that you barely speak. Think of it from the perspective of the native speaker. They just want to go about their business and some joker is in their face about how the tree is near but the building is far.    You wouldn't speak adult level German for instance to an infant and expect it to understand you,   I am raising two children bilingually and I can assure you that we have never spoken to them in baby talk. We always have spoken to them like normal people. And again, why do you think there is any connection between how parents interact with their children in acquiring their native language and how strangers interact with novice language learners?"
duolingo,3brsav,aewillia,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:00:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is talking about baby-talking a nonnative speaker.  When you start out, you're conjugating verbs wrong all the time.

Then i started going to language exchange meetups, and it helped tremendously. I had already gained some confidence and from listening to radio and podcasts in Spanish I could really start to have some real-world conversations where I was not completely lost.

I am currently studying, just finished studying actually, in Austria! Let me tell you something, after studying German for a year, I can hardly understand Native German speakers speaking at their normal pace. I can understand foreign german speakers quite well, but not native speakers. So definitely ask them to slow down and repeat! They will not say no.  On your accent and grammar, you will learn that when you are constantly involved with the language. After a month here, now it's hard to speak English without using German grammar.   I feel as though spoken German is on a level so far from written German, and I first realized that after my first skype call with a native speaker. I had to ask so many times, ""what"" ""can you repeat that?"" and so on. Don't be discouraged. This is more of a reality check, but can be too harsh. A week in German shouldn't get you very far in spoken German, but comfortable with beginner sentences! :D   You'll get there. Taking that leap a week in is crazy and I give you mad respect.

There are some really good TED talks from some polyglots and how they learned quickly without even knowing a single word. Very inspiring and motivating.

One should never expect fluency from Duo - it just won't happen. Mastering a skill, any skill, takes commitment and a lot of time, something most people don't have the drive or work ethic for.

From what I see, it also seems to be the most difficult course on the site for English speakers with the vocabulary and grammar taught. But language is for practical use: communicating information, be it opinions, jokes, or news. Consider a slow podcast to listen and dynamically (rather than reflexively) respond to. e.g. ask what happened, why, and what you think of it. If you blank on a word or saying, I guess translate.google.com wouldn't be too bad a tool. I mean, this method is closer to a conversation than the overview of the grammar on Duolingo."

There will be times where you'll make no sense, that has happened to me in the past, and it's gonna feel like a kick in the gut but just as long as you keep learning and keep speaking eventually you'll feel comfortable doing it.

duolingo,3brsav,Thoradorable,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:58:04 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, problem is that Duolingo is doing an okay job at teaching vocab and sentence structure, but nothing you can use in a conversation besides wie geht's dir - unless the native speaker is familiar with the vocab you're learning.

duolingo,3brsav,EinsamWulf,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:43:51 2015 UTC,"After one week of German and having had no immersion I think you bit off more than you can chew but I also think it's good that you did that. You may not have been able to have a conversation (if you had done so you would probably be a linguistic savant) but you got some immersion which is great.  I'm just starting to learn German in an organized way, before this I lived in Germany for 3 years so I got a ton of immersion but now I wished that I'd actually taken advantage of the language classes that were offered to me (at the time I was both working and completing my bachelors degree so I was quite busy but such is life).  Keep at it, maybe try practicing your German with another Duolingo user or a fellow redditor, it can't hurt and you may end up teaching someone else a thing or two."
duolingo,3brsav,Seroton1n,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:31:05 2015 UTC,"I have been learning English since the age of 4 (although at a different pace because I was obviously very little) and I'm still not at the C2 level. Imagine that! Don't worry buddy, you had a conversation after just a week.   I kind of weigh it like this: you could spend 3 hours a day for 7 days practicing a language. That's 21 hours. It equates to almost two days in Germany in terms of immersion! It takes at least a year to be able to comfortably hold a conversation. And only if you practice a lot, every day. Many, many years until your vocabulary is somewhat close to one of a native speaker.   I'm glad you got your motivation back. :) Just remember: to be able to speak in a language, that is what you have to do. Speak. The more you do something, the better you'll become at it. Don't worry about making mistakes, because you'll make so many of them in every single sentence, it becomes silly. But that is the only way to learn. If you could read every German textbook, memorize every grammar rule, you still wouldn't be able to speak. Because it's not what you practiced.   Don't beat yourself up over mistakes you make. Seriously, you'll make so many of them, some of them really simple and stupid. But that should only serve you as a reminder that you're learning."

duolingo,3brsav,nippleeee,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:14:04 2015 UTC,"I think the first conversations are hard regardless of when you have them, so you may be ahead of the game for getting it over with so soon!  I moved to Germany after studying university level German for a year, and I thought (way too) highly of my own skills. Imagine my surprise when I arrived and found that I was stumbling over my words, unable to think fast enough to have a natural conversation, and completely lost as to what real people with real German accents were saying most of the time! I got over it pretty quickly, but it took regular practice and a lot of mistakes to improve. Some of my ex-pat friends had been there a lot longer than me, and unless you accept that you're going to be wrong a lot, it's quite hard to ever improve. German also has a lot of range in variety from region to region, so it can take even more time to get used to different native speakers as a beginner. Unless the person you talked to was from Hanover or something, they may or may not have spoken to you in Hochdeutsch.   You might want to find a language exchange partner to learn some conversation skills. At least then, you can trade language speaking skills and take turns feeling like you'll never stop making mistakes ;) Also, regularly watching German films is a fun and good way to practice comprehension. I also watched a crime tv show called Tatort a lot, which features different cities in Germany and gives a little taste of regional differences."

duolingo,3bl6jl,Qichin,12,Tue Jun 30 07:25:34 2015 UTC,My guess is that Americans used (and still use) their language as one of the unifying factors to form a national identity out of a nation that started out very multicultural and varied.

I grew up partly in Los Angeles and San Diego and it would have been extremely beneficial to at least have child-level Spanish if for nothing else to be able to talk with all the kids at school and around the block.   Looking back now I regret not actively trying to pick it up.
duolingo,3bl6jl,Ayy_1mao,5,Thu Jul 2 03:36:51 2015 UTC,"Because multicultural nations tend to Balkanize in the long run.  In a nation of immigrants, a single common language is all you've really got.  A majority of Americans are of German descent and they still unanimously learned English, it would be good to see more Hispanic people do the same."
duolingo,3bl6jl,MauriceReeves,8,Tue Jun 30 13:11:31 2015 UTC,"Studies have shown that immigrants almost never learn the English language when they arrive.  Ever.  Doesn't matter the country of origin, if they don't know it already, they don't learn it.  Their children (the first-generation Americans) learn both languages, but usually adopt English more and only use their parents' language at home/with family, and the third generation completely loses the use of their grandparents language, or are able to understand it when spoken to them, but respond in English.  The reason there is this perception in America that Hispanic people don't speak English is because you're seeing the initial wave of immigrants that have just come here from another country.  If you look at their children though, they're speaking English.  On top of that, our education system doesn't make it easy to learn English for free.    So many people in America say they want immigrants to assimilate but put up roadblocks to things that would make it easier to assimilate.  For example, if you move to Germany or Denmark, etc and want to become a citizen, there are actual language classes you have to take in order to complete your path to citizenship.  It's paid for by the government and required.  Some places in the US make those kinds of classes available, but some don't.  Or if they are available they're far away and hard to get to, especially if you're a poor immigrant who doesn't have access to a car and/or mass transit isn't available.  For example, in South Central Pennsylvania, where I'm currently living, there are large populations of Hispanic migrant workers in and around Gettysburg because of the orchards.  If you recently came to the US and you find yourself in tiny Biglerville, PA (home of the National Apple Museum) your closest option for ESL class is 25+ miles away in Carlisle, PA.  So you're working 12+ hours in the orchard making a pittance, living ten to a room in a small house, walking to the migrant shelter to get something to eat or get some clothes because it really is a lot colder than it is back home in Guatemala, all the while sending almost everything you earn or are given get back home because you still have it better than them, and your extended family back in Guatemala is depending on you to work your hardest.    Tell me, how are you going to make it the 25 miles one-way to class?  You think you have the energy to learn a new language after all that?"
duolingo,3bl6jl,Qichin,6,Tue Jun 30 14:18:01 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. The sentiment I see tends to look like ""Why won't these immigrants just magically pick up our language?"""
duolingo,3bl6jl,koavf,2,Wed Jul 1 10:33:34 2015 UTC,A majority of Americans are of German descent   This isn't even close to true—it's less than a fifth. I think you mean a plurality. The rest of your comments are equally suspect but not as empirically wrong.
duolingo,3bl6jl,BuiltLikeTaft,5,Sun Jul 5 05:09:34 2015 UTC,"Ugh. So much wrong with this. First, the word you're looking for is a plurality, not a majority. And German immigrants definitely did not unanimously learn English. It was really common for German immigrants to maintain their own language and not learn English at all for much of the 19th and early 20th century. World War II and the tide of anti-German sentiment that went along with it put an end to that. Also, there have been Spanish speakers in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California for longer than those areas have been part of the US. While immigration has served to reinforce the position of Spanish, it is flat out incorrect to assert that Spanish is an immigrant language."
duolingo,3bl6jl,Ayy_1mao,0,Tue Jun 30 13:39:56 2015 UTC,"Texas broke away from Mexico because there were more Northern European settlers moving there than people from southern and central Mexico.

duolingo,3bkzly,brasscaribou,5,Tue Jun 30 03:54:25 2015 UTC,"Non sono op, ma voglio dirti la mia opinione comunque. Ho finito circa 90% dall'albero.  The Italian tree gives you a solid base for advancing further with books and by practicing communication. You will be able to get the gist out of most written material, but there will still be regularly words that you'll have to look up. Writing on the other hand is more complicated. It takes a lot more time to think about using the correct tenses, verb forms etc. But it is possible to communicate! Speaking is a little harder and goes pretty slow in the beginning. On the other hand with all the hearing and speaking exercises pronounciation doesn't seem to be a problem at all. Lastly listening. Thats brutal because real Italians talk frigging fast, but with practice you'll get there.  So in conclusion: Fluency, no. Will you starve in the Italian countryside? Probably not!"

duolingo,3bkx21,Blu-shell,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:45:55 2015 UTC,"The best thing I ever did for my listening comprehension of real people was switch a lot of my media to German. You like the show Vikings at all? It has a really good German dub (personally I try to avoid things set in America because the American accents the voice actors put on, particularly if a character has an R in their name or a title like lord/lady, kid of make me cringe, but you might not mind it) and you can get it here for pretty cheap. It's easy enough to run foreign DVDs on a laptop with VLC. Don't have English subtitles turned on (you could try having German subtitles on but they don't usually match what they're saying exactly) and after a while of watching it you should notice you're able to understand more and more. (cough there's also always kinox.to if you're hard up for cash cough)  Edit* oh and don't forget video games, if you have skyrim on steam (or any game really, open world games are just really good for this) just right click on it in library, open the properties, go to the language tab, and switch it to German. It'll download an update and then everything, voices and all, will be German.  Edit 2* Ok I'm reading some reviews of the Vikings dvd and it seems like they used a different dub than the TV broadcast and everyone seems to hate it, so maybe a stream of that particular show would be better."

Even if I'm litsening to a conversation where I can understand all the vocab and grammar, I can only comprehend about one word about every five seconds.

My New Year's Resolution was a two parter. The first was to finish my Spanish tree, which I finished by the end of May, and the second resolution was to finish my Swedish tree. I'm also learning Esperanto and German on Duolingo, and I think I should be able to make these my New Year's Resolutions for next year, and I'll probably start on some new languages next year, as well.   Generally when I start learning a language, I start looking for people to speak them with simply because I can't expect to learn this many without using them in my daily life; I go all out, to be honest.

duolingo,3bkvb5,Alsterwasser,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:32:59 2015 UTC,"Portuguese: Took me probably about 8 months, if not a bit longer. I had some background in Spanish, which helped me get through the earlier parts, but the latter were much more difficult. After finishing the tree, I could read most things, write a good amount, and could not really speak or listen well. After listening to a lot of Brazilian music, using other supplements (namely Duo Immersion, Memrise, and Anki), and having real conversations with other speakers, I'm probably a B1 level right now, maybe ""B1+"". I started learning a little over a year ago.  German: This tree went a bit faster (probably 5-6 months) for a few reasons. One, I had learned a decent amount of German a few years back (using Livemocha, before it went to shit), so it was a bit quicker getting started. Two, it was my second (third, sort of) tree, so I was able to understand the learning processes a bit better. I just recently started using more supplements (primarily Anki, as well as a bit of FluentU), but would probably say I'm at A2. I can understand spoken German about as well as Portuguese now, but can't read as well, which is probably a mixture of my learning method and the nature of the two languages.   I can't formulate thoughts and phrases well in either language, but that is probably the hardest jump to make. For both trees, I finished around level 19-21, so there wasn't a whole lot difference between the two as far as balance between lessons and time. I'm now doing my first ""chain"" tree - German to French. So far, I think it is helpful. I'm hoping I can improve my German abilities while also learning a new language. I'm planning to apply a bit different approach for this one though, sort of ""plowing through"" the lessons a bit, and doing fewer ""strengthen"" exercises."

duolingo,3bfb4i,tomato_water,8,Sun Jun 28 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"That's a very subjective inquiry.   Plenty of people are just interested in completing the tree(s), while others have previous training and use DL as a tuneup.--These are most of quicker ones. I doubt most of the 4 and 5 flag waivers have really gained anything of lasting value as most just seem to go on to the next DL course that interests them   I started last October and was persistent, daily, until the end of December(~65% complete) at which time a power outage robbed me of my streak and I quit. I picked it up from the beginning with a new account in the 3rd week of April and finished this past week with a 560 point rally.   Do what works for you because measuring against others will only make you crazy."
duolingo,3bfb4i,lurningstough,7,Sun Jun 28 19:55:01 2015 UTC,"Here's how I look at it:   If I finish this course in a few months, I am doing well EVEN IF I don't remember it all. Why?   1- Finishing the tree means I have been exposed to various parts of the language, from saying hello, to past tense, to future tense, etc. This allows me to now build on that knowledge by reading books, watching movies, doing other courses etc.   2- The tree remains there, meaning I can redo it over and over again and keep it golden, until I know every single vocab by heart.   That's my plan anyways. I don't believe that it would be beneficiary if I saw Duolingo as the be all and end all course, and as a result not move on to other sources, including reading children's books, until I know all the vocab.   Hope this helps clear up this this Duo user's mindset."
duolingo,3bfb4i,readit_getit,4,Sun Jun 28 21:11:14 2015 UTC,"I finished the Swedish tree, and while I can express most things I would want to say, I am very far from fluent, and suspect that my knowledge would disappear quickly if I stopped.  However, if I can take it to the next level by keeping the tree gold for a couple of months, and more importantly, reading, watching TV/movies, and talking to natives, I think from that point it will be much easier to keep my knowledge current and retain it - I'm hoping that at that point, just reading a novel over the course of each month will do the trick."
duolingo,3bfb4i,v316,2,Sun Jun 28 23:04:53 2015 UTC,"Heck, I've heard stories about people finishing whole trees -- start to finish -- in a number of days. I think there was a post here about someone who finished the Esperanto tree something like 44 hours after its debut, though that's probably a special case given Esperanto's regularity.  If you just finished a tree in a month and quit, I suspect you (a) wouldn't speak the language well at all and (b) would forget everything you learned fairly quickly. Thorough learning involves revisiting prior material; for Duolingo this means keeping the tree at least someone golden when it would otherwise atrophy. If you finish after a month you'll have missed that opportunity.  That said, if you keep up with it after you finished the tree, doing it quickly probably wouldn't hurt. But I wouldn't expect to have learned it very well."
duolingo,3bfb4i,cunningjames,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:52:11 2015 UTC,"We retain things if they're useful.  If you burn through the tree in two weeks and then continue to use the language every day, it'll stick.  Some people spend years learning a language and then forget it because they never use it.  Some people even get rusty in their native language after a long time abroad.     apparently people finish in as little as a couple months.    The Insane schedule is 50 points per day, which usually takes me 30 minutes or less.  If I earn 10 of those points from review and 40 from new subjects, I'd finish a typical tree in about three months.  To me that doesn't seem too ridiculous, it's just about putting the time in every day.     Am I a really inefficient learner, or do some people just speed ahead too fast for proper retention?   It could be anything, but I personally would lean toward the former. If you're spending an hour on Duolingo and not making significant progress, what are you doing?  Without knowing your situation, my first guess would be that since you're not practicing every day, you're spending a lot more time on review."
duolingo,3bfb4i,krnm,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:41:34 2015 UTC,"I've done most of the German tree in under a month, and that includes about a week's worth of break time.  I'm very good at learning nouns and verb conjugations - and then figuring out the rest - but I also supplement a bit. I just got a German reader to see how much I was actually retaining - and so far I'm retaining a lot more than I'd expected."

I also use flashcards (or Memrise) I listen to Spanish learning podcasts any tie in am in the car, I watch at least one episode of an easy language Spanish television show every day.

duolingo,3bb9sk,BAHatesToFly,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:14:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a few days late to this, but here are a few suggestions, mostly apps (I have a droid/use Google Play, so YMMV):  -To start, I'd highly recommend learning at least the Katakana/Hiragana. I learned using 'Hiragana - Learn Japanese' and 'Katakana - Learn Japanese apps', both by Legendarya. Neither have descriptive titles, but they should be one of the first results when you search the Play store. They're free. This is the Hiragana one. Both apps have a flash card interface as well as a very good touch-screen finger-drawing section to learn how to write the characters. Very strict on stroke order.  -In this vein, the app Obenkyo is very good as well.  -Human Japanese. This app is incredible. To date, it's the only app I've ever actually bought and paid full price for. There's a trial version of it, but you'll probably quickly want to buy the whole thing. There's a beginner and an intermediate app.  HJ is textbook-style, but not dry and always compares ideas and grammar back to the way English functions. It's fun, brisk, and teaches you a lot. Each chapter has Review quizzes and Vocabulary quizzes. The early chapters also teach you Hiragana/Katakana and has a matching game. Seriously, I love this app.  -Memrise. Flashcard-style memory tool. I thoroughly recommend the app versus the web interface for Japanese, as the website is finicky about romanji typing.  -There are other apps/websites like Tae Kim, Kanji Sempai, EasyKanji, etc. A good thing to do is to search the free apps and check out some of the higher rated ones.  -Also, if you're willing to throw down a little money, japanesepod101.com is a pretty great resource. Their podcast is great. You could do their free trial and download as much of the podcast as you can to check it out. Further, some of the expensive programs are good, too, but there's so much free/cheap information out there, you probably won't need them.  Hope this helps!"
duolingo,3bb9sk,Vilokthoria,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:28:42 2015 UTC,There's a game called Hiragana Pixel Party. It teaches Hiragana and Katakana. It's not that exciting but definitely good to build up some basic reading skills. Not sure if there's a good grammar/vocabulary app though.

duolingo,3b3tzt,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:39:58 2015 UTC,"Section 28. Verbs of Motion of article  Russian grammar:       Verbs of motion (also referred to as VoM) are a distinct class of verbs found in several Slavic languages. Due to the extensive semantic information they contain, Russian verbs of motion pose difficulties for non-native learners at all levels of study.  Unprefixed verbs of motion, which are all imperfective, divide into pairs based on the direction of the movement (uni- or multidirectional—sometimes called determinate/indeterminate or definite/indefinite). As opposed to a verb-framed language, in which path is encoded in the verb, but manner of motion typically is expressed with complements, Russian is a satellite language, meaning that these concepts are encoded in both the root of the verb and the particles associated with it, satellites.  Thus, the roots of motion verbs convey the lexical information of manner of movement, e.g. walking, crawling, running, whereas prefixes denote path, e.g. motion in and out of space.   The roots also distinguish between means of conveyance, e.g. by transport or by one’s own power, and, in transitive verbs, the object or person being transported.  The information below provides an outline of the formation and basic usage of unprefixed and prefixed verbs of motion.

Also..I am using Duo to get a foundation not actually learn the language. I now know how to generally construct a typical Spanish sentence; I know construction of some of the verbs in past tense; etc; and of course by the time the tree is done, I'll probably know 600-700 words by heart (I think Duo teaches you over a 1000, but I don't expect to know all of them by heart).

You may feel like you've got a decent grasp on what you just learned, but more often than not you'll have forgotten a large chunk of it a week later if you don't look at it again.  Personally, I go by the following rules:   Do at least one new lesson (by which I don't mean the entirety of Adverbs II, but rather just one sub-lesson of it) per day. For every lesson, do two reviews If there are skills which aren't golden, review those directly. Only do the strengthen all skills thingy if all skills are golden. Never do timed strengthen, it sucks. Generally speaking, review skills further down the tree.

duolingo,3azheh,ReedsAndSerpents,2,Sun Jun 28 01:08:25 2015 UTC,In so many words. I feel like when there wasn't a common Euro word for something they went with an almost identical Latin version or literally the same exact word and meaning. With a strong grasp of English and even elementary Romance understanding it would be excessively easy to pick up.  The main allure from a language learning stand point is that it is an order of magnitude easier than the others. Once you get used to the grammar (it feels like highly simplified Latin to me) it then becomes a matter of vocabulary. Idk if you've seen the vids of people conversing after finishing the Duolingo tree but they speak like someone with about six months experience in a natural tongue. With weeks and not months of practice they could easily sharpen up to enviable fluency that you just can't get in equal time to an unplanned tongue.

""I ate fried.ACC fish.ACC, chips.ACC and coleslaw.ACC for dinner.""  'Fried' is an adjective so it gets marked along with the nouns in the noun phrase - 'fish' 'chips' and 'coleslaw'. 'Dinner' doesn't get marked though because it comes after a preposition.  Some prepositions in English precede the direct object however, because the preposition is part of the verb phrase in a sense. You can see this another way - if the noun is a location and the verb has direction or motion information in the English, then the noun should not be marked with the accusative, because this is the oblique case. Some languages merge the accusative with the oblique but Esperanto uses the unmarked/plain form for the oblique and the nominative.  If the noun is NOT a location and the verb DOES NOT have direction or motion information in the English, then you can assume the noun after the verb IS the accusative."

duolingo,3ax41y,ChrissiTea,9,Wed Jun 24 09:55:57 2015 UTC,"Getting two or three answers wrong would make me have to restart the section that I was working on. I know that this would motivate a lot of people to do better the next time, and that is how it worked on me for a while. But after some time it just began to get frustrating. The current system of 'get 15~' correct, and still pass through even if you get some wrong, has given me more motivation than the prior system. I find that getting less 1-star ratings and having the chance to keep going even after I get 3 wrong has helped a lot. In turn, I've went from not really liking Duolingo to wanting to be on it all day long (therefore working on my problem areas more). As I'm a lone-learner, I've found that this type of motivation will be essential for me (whether it comes from Duo or not). I hope this makes sense."
duolingo,3ax41y,hseldon10,3,Wed Jun 24 19:29:26 2015 UTC,Esta bien! I'm also learning Español. Do you takes notes or read textbooks whilst learning with Duolingo?
duolingo,3ax41y,ChessedGamon,3,Wed Jun 24 13:59:14 2015 UTC,"I don't take notes, though I probably should. I do actively make vocabulary lists, though. Most can be found here: https://sites.google.com/site/learnthepalabras/.  The only time I've ever really taken notes is when I was learning how conjugation works, and how certain verbs are used. For example, I made an AR-verb conjugation wallpaper for my phone, so every time I got on my phone, it was more ingrained in my mind, before it finally stuck!   I do have reference books, and hope to get more soon, though I never really use them. In part because I'm not at the level that the books are made for, yet.   ¿Y tú? :)"
duolingo,3ax41y,ChessedGamon,2,Wed Jun 24 19:41:08 2015 UTC,"Loving the lists, these will really help me.  Writing down the actual vocabulary is something I haven't done whilst learning this time. I studied French and German in school with textbooks and constant vocabulary work and thought I'd try a less academic approach for Spanish - I don't think it's working as well, haha.   I write down all the grammar and additional notes duolingo put with the lessons (the differences between este/estos/ese etc) but I'm definitely not remembering the content as well as I did in the classroom environment.   I've been having a go at translating articles which is interesting but I find myself hovering over almost every word and it feels like I'm cheating. Have you tried any of that yet?"
duolingo,3ax41y,NessThunder,2,Wed Jun 24 22:53:12 2015 UTC,"I've tried translating articles on Duolingo but I don't really get anything from it. Mostly because most of it is using vocabulary that I'm not familiar with, but also because I'm not at that high level of reading comprehension, yet.   It's easier for me to take the vocabulary from a children's book, memorize its Spanish equivalents, and then try to write a Spanish translation for it. On Amazon Prime, and many other websites, they offer kids' books at the A1-A2 level for free. I start small and keep going up in the level - kind of like 'hooked on phonics' books.  So, yeah, with that said, I totally understand what you're talking about! I wish Duolingo had each document sorted out from 'easy' to 'hard.' Maybe in a future update."

It would be quite a lot of work to give up (because hungarian is unrelated to english, it is much more work than for the swedish course).  I think that, if nothing happens during summer, the duolingo staff will oblige them to take more people in the team or something like that. But restarting from scratch seems unlikely."

Aside from Duolingo, I use a combination of Memrise, Lingvist, and Pimsleur. Does anyone know any other really good resources to use? I'm thinking of using Babbel, but I don't know if it's any good, or if it's worth paying for it monthly. Does anyone have any experience with this? I begin school in August, if I were to take a course, should I start from the beginning, or a little more advanced course?"

duolingo,3awm59,pyrogeddon,9,Wed Jun 24 03:11:55 2015 UTC,"I excel in reading but have a little difficulty formulating or articulating sentences myself. (For practice, whenever I think or say something, I think ,""How would I say this in French"" and do so) But speaking and conversation is a whole 'nother beast. I find that so long as they speak slowly, I'm more or less able to understand 80% of what they're saying. That being said, I'm absolute garbage at speaking (an issue I'm trying to rectify with Pimsleur.) With music depending what it is, I'm able to understand or pick out individual phrases/sentences at a time, and once I've had a glance at the lyrics, I could understand the song. I understand Disney music the best, because I sort of have context for certain songs, like from Mulan or Pocahontas. With other music, like Stromae, Edith Piaf, or maybe Opera, I usually have to see the French lyrics. To give you a bit of reference on listening to speech, I'm only on Unit 9, Level 1 of Pimsleur right now, and outta sheer curiosity, I skipped all the way to the last lesson of Lesson 3 and to my surprise I was able to understand everything! :) Of course it's also worth mentioning that I'm a native English and Spanish speaker; whenever I don't understand vocabulary, chances are that it's a cognate in either English or Spanish. (lucky me)  I'm not going to abandon my French, I'm just merely going to add on Esperanto on top of it. Since I usually did 100xp a day in order to finish the tree, I'm not only going to strengthen with 50xp and the other 50xp goes to Esperanto. Of course, it also helps that Esperanto is said to be easier than the other languages."

duolingo,3at3gf,myxopyxo,2,Tue Jun 23 18:17:08 2015 UTC,"""Fluency"" on Duolingo is not really a measure of how often you make mistakes.

I got another about 2/3 month back saying I can have every language unlocked for a certain amount too. As what you pay only opens one language  (although all quick email to support they will move over your subscription) I did that just to check if the course are copy/paste of each other.

Use a course like this, and go through it lesson by lesson. You'll get the vocab drilled into your head very quickly, because you're getting way more repetition. Once you've finished a block, go straight to Duolingo and test out of that lesson. As long as you keep things up to date on Memrise, which is way quicker and more thorough than I find it to be on Duolingo, you should race through the course."

With German I found one that had the pronunciation too, which was nice.   I might try Anki too.

It will be difficult at first - but, you have to challenge yourself. I think most courses like duolingo/memrise, etc. get you to that point but that's it. It will be difficult to improve at this point by doing vocabulary flashcards. You have to consume native materials and gradually build confidence.   There are various guides on what to read and how to approach it. I haven't studied much Spanish, but it seems that Harry Potter is good for this stage and the Spanish translation is good.

By the time you've finished all six parts, you'll have the 5,000 most commonly used words.  I also think the cards are well done; there are lots of mems already built and many words have multiple voices.    What constitutes ""most commonly used"" varies according to your source data, and what's useful isn't always common, so another user created ""top up"" courses to add another 3,000 words from other word lists.

duolingo,3ajq4q,FuhrerFury,13,Sun Jun 21 00:29:20 2015 UTC,"It's hard to pick a favorite, since I enjoy them all. If I had to pick, I have a soft spot for French since it was my first one, Turkish is really interesting as an agglutinative language, Esperanto is great for its lack of exceptions to rules, and German is fun to speak in an angry voice. Least favorite - maybe Irish? It's not a knock against the tree, but more that it probably has the highest effort to practical value ratio for me.  I've thought about going deeper into French since it's the one I know best, and I have made some efforts into it, but I found that I wasn't that motivated since there isn't any concrete goal that I would be working towards. It's been more useful for me to just have a foundation in multiple languages - e.g. I went on a trip to Sweden and Finland a few weeks ago that wasn't planned too far in advance, and knowing some Swedish was helpful there."
duolingo,3ajq4q,PM_ME_UR_MATHPROBLEM,27,Sun Jun 21 13:51:22 2015 UTC,Crazy people. I'm having enough trouble slowly inching my single tree forward. I envy you bastards.

duolingo,3ajq4q,LimeGreenTeknii,8,Sun Jun 21 01:10:18 2015 UTC,"Not significantly; sometimes it's a mildly interesting conversation point if I meet a native speaker of one of the languages, but I don't get to use any of them regularly. Of course, I get some personal sense of satisfaction and fulfillment from it as well. In terms of time spent, I usually use time that would be spent on non-productive things, and it's not like I'm blowing off other personal commitments for this, so not a big impact there either.  For most of the languages, I feel comfortable reading basic texts that don't have too much specialized or technical language in them, e.g. I found that I could read most of the ads I saw in Sweden. The Romance and Scandinavian languages are my stronger languages. Listening is another story - for most of the languages I can pick out some words and sentences of conversation, but not nearly as well as reading. Speaking I haven't tested myself on, but I'd imagine it's also not very strong."

duolingo,3ajq4q,KingArhturII,8,Tue Jun 23 01:45:49 2015 UTC,How much has your comfort with each language improved after completing the trees from keeping them gold?
duolingo,3ajq4q,astoundingchair,6,Sat Jun 20 23:04:41 2015 UTC,"I found that keeping the trees gold helped a lot with reinforcing vocab, since it was basically like doing flash cards. And unlike straight-up flash cards, the vocab words here are in the context of a (usually) meaningful sentence. For grammar, if I didn't have a solid understanding the first time around, repeating exercises helps sometimes (e.g. reinforcing certain word orders, reinforcing conjugations), but not always. For a few lessons, I would need to spend more focused effort to fully grasp. There are also definitely diminishing returns to keeping trees gold for a long time."

I did try to go a bit deeper into French and found my motivation flagging because there wasn't a concrete goal that I was working towards.

I just started doing it on the bus back and forth to school.   I suppose it depends on how you define 'a good level', but I consider my level to be fairly decent in most of the languages I'm doing. I've read novels in French, have a minor in German, and my wife's Russian/Ukrainian.   I have a Bachelor's in Linguistics and I'm currently in a Master's program (I'll be applying to PhD programs next year), so it helps me tremendously to see varying structures across languages. I'm in documentary ling, so I need to be able to identify and analyze features of languages and the more exposure I have to a variety of different languages, the better.   I'm looking forward to doing the Turkish tree to get an idea of how an agglutinative language works in context, and I'm pretty interested in the Irish one as well so I can see some of the consequences of a VSO order on an inflecting language and investigate consonant mutation from phonological and morphological viewpoints. It's also going to be interesting to see the community's response to ergativity whenever Hindi is released."

I hate that feature of Duolingo, it should be ignored after you complete 1/3 of the tree.   2) yeah, immersion in real media and talking to real live Germans are the only ways to really get listening down.

duolingo,3aigpt,TilverTailDope,4,Sat Jun 20 14:31:40 2015 UTC,"Something to note is that French and Spanish are a lot more similar to each other than Spanish and German. In one respect this can help because a lot of the words and grammar are very similar so you don't have to memorize as much, but in another it can become confusing if you start to mix them up.   I think it's really personal preference. Some people are much more adept at learning languages than others. On average, I'm inclined to think that you would learn faster focusing on one and then the other, especially if it's your second language that you are acquiring."

duolingo,3aigpt,lurningstough,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:21:30 2015 UTC,"I've been studying French off and on for a couple of years as well and just started the Spanish course last week.   The good news is that you'll probably have an easier time with the vocabulary. Knowing English and French will cover most of the word roots and after having gotten used to French conjugation patterns, learning the Spanish ones were a breeze. The nouns conjugate way more predictably than in French and you don't have to deal with partitives. Anecdotally, I'm already nearing the third checkpoint after four days.   The biggest struggle for me so far has been pronunciation. Part of it is just being new to Spanish and its rhythm. I've also accidentally given a couple of French responses in the speaking exercises and it takes me a couple of seconds to realize why it's not understanding my (obviously correct) answer.   So in summary, you'll probably get things a little crossed but, at least for me, it hasn't been too much of a problem. According to others I've talked to who speak multiple languages from similar families, if you practice enough you'll eventually develop mental language sets which makes crossover less common."

I learned Italian 13 years ago and French about 4 years back, and started Duo in 2012, I think, and my progress in both of those has been just review.  I dedicate some time, about a month or so, (when I'm actually remembering to do Duo!) to one particular language. I might do a few lessons lessons in 2 non-related languages in a day. I also use Anki and make flashcards, so when I go back to a language that I haven't exactly spent a lot of time with, I have all the resources and materials to get back up to speed pretty quickly, without needing to redo lessons.  My brain has exploded. I find it hard to read text in Portuguese from time to time, and come down with a massive headache trying to read it; that is simply something that doesn't happen with any of my other languages. The lines between tongues start crossing after a while; my favorite example of this is when thinking and speaking in English, I'll start using French swears; this happens a LOT when I am extremely upset.  The big downfall to all of this is that I don't spend enough time talking in one language over another, and my pronunciation in non-Romantic languages needs work."

As I had some prior knowledge and the two languages are quite similar, I progressed quite quickly, but particularly because the two of them are so similar I'd recommend to start the second one only once you are rather good at the first one.

Of the finished trees, one I try to spend some time reading novels/news websites/playing games with lots of text every single day, generally an hour or more, one I make an effort to do some grammar book exercises every day but...uh, haven't so much lately, and one I don't even give a fuck about and have no idea why I thought that'd be a good idea. I feel like I'm very slowly improving the first one and will eventually hit fluency, but I'm not in a rush.   Of the other two, esperanto I'm just rushing through in one window while I watch netflix in the other. I have absolutely no goals in esperanto, basically it's just fucking around. Turkish I would like to learn well enough to read some really basic material, and I do a few exercises a day when I'm out and about. Fluency is explicitly not my goal.   I think I'm helped a lot because of these five, three are from different language families and one of the others is a hyperlogical constructed language. Vocabulary is either extremely different or obviously a loan word. (Hm, I wonder if iomaniocht is from french or not?)  Also I got fuck-all else that's even half useful to do with my time. Unemployment lol."

duolingo,3ah9bl,pacebailey,8,Sat Jun 20 04:07:34 2015 UTC,Norwegian seems to be the middle ground of the Scandinavian languages. It's also the most beautiful country (don't attack me - personal opinion). If you speak Norwegian you can understand most Swedish and read perfectly Danish. As to why I chose Norwegian; my boyfriend lives there.
duolingo,3ah9bl,PrincesaCereza,3,Sat Jun 20 20:05:16 2015 UTC,"Most of my family comes from Sweden and Iceland, so it sort of made sense for me to go straight to Swedish. It's not a terribly hard language if English is your first. My girlfriend's first language is Spanish and she's having a hell of a time. Breezing through Portuguese though. Lucky bitch.  Edit: a word"
duolingo,3ah9bl,IAmTheEngineer,4,Sat Jun 20 04:30:43 2015 UTC,My girlfriend's first language is Spanish and she's having a hell of a time.    That's interesting.   It's only not a terribly hard language if English is your first.   And if you speak German as well you can make a connection to 85%(+) of all north-germanic words. For me it doesn't even feel like learning new vocabulary but more like adapting to the spelling.  I like the Norwegian course on duolingo more than the Swedish and Danish course but all have a pretty good quality imo.
duolingo,3ah9bl,atlas_at,4,Sat Jun 20 05:17:54 2015 UTC,"Dunno, going from German to Norwegian, the words are like German, if you drop half the letters and barely pronounce the other half :D"
duolingo,3ah9bl,Zaphid,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:10:27 2015 UTC,I would like to disagree on that. I find Swedish to be pretty different from German (altough there are similarities). Learning German gives as many points in the school system as French and Spanish here in Sweden.
duolingo,3ah9bl,Gnofar,2,Sat Jun 20 17:19:54 2015 UTC,They are indeed different. I wanted to say that knowing English AND German is very helpful to recognize related words. Sometimes I know a word from English... sometimes from German.
duolingo,3ah9bl,atlas_at,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:13:16 2015 UTC,Yes of course. And knowing both do help alot. It's just that i wanted to mention that they are not that intelligible aside from the similar vocabulary.
duolingo,3ah9bl,Gnofar,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:52:15 2015 UTC,"My family is German and Scottish in a very removed way. I'm more curious about why one would learn Swedish or Norwegian from the practicality of finding natives or the amount of untranslated original works. Any thoughts? I'm a decent B1/B2 in French, but that doesn't quite transfer over."
duolingo,3ah9bl,courtkneeee,3,Sat Jun 20 19:32:40 2015 UTC,"I started the Swedish course while patiently waiting for the Norwegian course to be released, and since it's been available, I've just been focusing on Norwegian.

duolingo,3ah9bl,heimaey,2,Sat Jun 20 23:38:21 2015 UTC,"I really want to learn Icelandic most of all, but I started with Danish (it was released first). I found it fun but I had a hard time understanding what was being said and so I switched to Swedish when it became available and I love love love Swedish. I feel pretty good in it and can have basic converstations and even read some newspapers, etc. I have started Norwegian because I have finished the Swedish tree and although I still practice Swedish, I wanted to see the differences between the languages."
duolingo,3ah9bl,_the_new_,2,Mon Jun 22 20:52:12 2015 UTC,"I started Swedish because of Swedish ancestry. Both of my grandfathers were fluent, but neither taught the language to their children. They're both passed, so I never had the opportunity to learn from them (other than a word here and there). Now that family back in Sweden has gotten in touch with us, I figured that it was the perfect time to learn.  Norwegian is next on the list though, as I've got family there as well."

The case system is pretty confusing for someone who hasn't already learned an inflected language, the gender of a noun matters, and isn't always self-evident (ultimately, you have to memorize the article, unlike in Spanish or Italian, where a lot more nouns have clear gender because of their ending), and adjectives are confusing, too."

It does set up the idea this is a one-shot video, but I personally would've at least had a text overlay,  or started with a short camera shot. Although Esperanto is a beta language, I still think it would've been cool to give it a brief mention, especially if this video is watched in the future, after it's out of beta. The subjunctive document could've seemed scary to people who feel like ""their brain isn't capable of learning another language,"" and it would've been nice to quickly bring up that Esperanto is a good stepping stone. Do you feel like your video needs some background music? I feel like DuoLingo needs background music too. Somebody should write some DuoLingo background music."

""to overlook"" can mean to miss or to omit.  So, ""I overlooked a mistake in the book,"" means, ""I missed finding a mistake in the book.""  I think you want to use ""to oversee"", which means to manage or to supervise.  ""The manager oversees the project.""  It's confusing because in English ""look"" and ""see"" have similar meanings, but ""overlook"" and ""oversee"" have different meanings.  Hope that helps."

duolingo,3ado7p,sciuridae_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:45:49 2015 UTC,"Welsh would be a good idea! It should be up fairly soon in the line.

I have  to  go through  those  and  see    [A]  What might be  helpful.  [B]  What's  still available in 2015.  -  And  of  course,  just  reading whatever  is  available.  (I  was  just reading an  article about an  election in Spain  before  checking this thread.)

duolingo,3a7u3f,No_regrats,4,Fri Jul 3 22:22:51 2015 UTC,"The Esperanto Like a Native courses on Memrise are great for vocabulary building. There are 5 or 6 sets of them with a couple hundred words each, so you won't go lacking. In fact, by the time you finish the Duolingo course, you'll have come across many of them.  For listening practice, Pasporto al la Tuta Mondo is quite hilarious and helpful, slowly building complexity as you finish each of the 16 episodes. For something more simple, there's the classic Mazi en Gondolando and Mazi Revenas al Gondolando.  For reading practice, there are several short, easy stories on lernu.net, including the aforementioned Gerda Malaperis. However, if you're crazy like me, you might enjoy racking your brain with Vikipedio, the Esperanto Wikipedia.  I, myself, have a rather large list of resources to go through as well, and will probably start slowly making my way through them after I finish the last 50ish lessons I have left in the tree. :P  Bonŝancon, amik'!"
duolingo,3a7u3f,Charwinger21,2,Thu Jun 18 02:44:26 2015 UTC,"This is good advice.  Jordan's ""Being Colloquial in Esperanto"" is a near-essential book for intermediate Esperanto.  Google it for an online version. I think the key thing for intermediate learners is developing vocabulary, comprehension, and speech.  So I listen to as much Esperanto radio as I can (kern.punkto.info podcast, CRI, muzaiko, etc), do memrise vocabulary, and try to write as much as possible."
duolingo,3a7u3f,MauriceReeves,2,Thu Jun 18 04:58:49 2015 UTC,"Reading skills: I highly recommend Gerda Malaperis as a first read. It's great for a beginner. Easy and progressive, designed for learning and both text and audio can be downloaded for free on Lernu, which allows for a better practice than text-only. Or read it directly on lernu so you can click on words you don't understand for an insta-translation. Vere aux Fantazie is a good alternatives. Same website (lernu), same author (Claude Piron), audio available for 6 stories, it's a bunch of short stories so easy to read and you won't get bored too fast. Once you are done, the next level could be 'La eta princo' (the little prince), maybe borrow the text in your native language at the same time so you can compare and get help when needed. Then 'Alice in Wonderlands' can be found in integral too but it's much harder, again, being able to read the text in the original English helps. I used lingq for both of those. An alternative is wikipedia in Esperanto or online newspapers, such as French newspaper 'le monde diplomatique' here. Writing skills: no secrets, you've got to practice. Duolingo user Criculann and others have a 'Stories for lingots' thread each week where a subject is posted and forumers are invited to post a story in a language they are learning. Corrections and lingots are given to participants. This week is theme is we love language thread and blog. Getting a penpal or posting texts on Lang-8 would also be great practices. Maybe joining the subs here and iirc channel as well.  Listening skills: the stories I've mentioned in reading are good. You could also listen to some podcasts. I used to listen to Radio Verda but you can look here for more suggestions or look up esperanto videos on YouTube. Speaking skills: I'd highly recommend looking if there is an Esperanto group in your town. If not or in additions, skyping with other learners or Esperantists is good too. I will also mention Pasaporto Servo, which is kind-of couchsurfing but for Esperantists, much older and without privacy concerns AFAIK.    Good luck. And if you are interested in skyping when you are done the tree, you can pm me. I learned Esperanto a couple years ago for a couple months but gave up for personal reasons. I've started again since it's been on duolingo but pacing myself so I don't rush through the tree."
duolingo,3a7u3f,LaceAndFlowers,7,Fri Jun 19 05:23:36 2015 UTC,How good would you say your Esperanto is now?  How much effort did you put in per day?  Did you have any prior experience with Esperanto or romance languages?
duolingo,3a7u3f,s4hockey4,8,Thu Jun 18 00:54:39 2015 UTC,"How good would you say your Esperanto is now?   ""Shaky beginner"".   -  Can  read  maybe  75%   of  written materials  without a  dictionary (including things that  aren't  written  specifically for beginners),  almost everything  with a  dictionary.   -  Can understand much that's  spoken.  -  Can  talk  like an  inarticulate beginner.  (This is mostly just a  question of not having a big  vocabulary  at this  point.  I  know  how  to conjugate  the  phrases ""now  launching  a rocket"",  ""launched a rocket"",  ""will launch a rocket""  -  but  I  don't  know  how  to say  ""launch"" or  ""rocket"".   :-)  It's  largely just a  question  of  expanding the  vocabulary.)  -  Writing,  pretty much as  for  speaking.    Did you have any prior experience with Esperanto or romance languages?   A little.  I did  the  ""10-Lesson  Correspondence  Course"",  which  gets  the  basic-basics  of    plurals  and verb  tenses  and  that  scary, scary  -n   out  of the way.  Did  a dozen  or so lessons  on  Lernu!   -  That's  about   it.  I  think that  those  previous  lessons  certainly  helped  with the  Duolingo  course,  but  not in any  significant way   -  the   Duolingo  course  covers the  same  items.   If  you start from  zero,  you'll  cover  those things anyway in the  first part  of the Duolingo  course.    Did you have any prior experience with ... romance languages   Some.  Not much. And  again, that helps,  but  it also can be  confusing.  Some of  the words are similar,  but  spelled differently  - if  you  use the  romance-language  spellings  you're often  inarticulate at best, and  probably  wrong and confusing in some  cases.  And  there are some  false  cognates  -   in Portuguese ""preta"" means  ""black"" and  ""tolo"" means  ""fool"",  but in  Esperanto those  words  mean ""ready"" and  ""linen"".  I  certainly think that the  course (English -> Esperanto) would be   good  for  anyone  who  only knows  English and  no  other  language.       tl;dr:  I think that the  course is  good.  :-)"
duolingo,3a7u3f,JMunn21,5,Thu Jun 18 02:38:36 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I figured I'd chime in with some things:  I have some exposure to romance languages and I try to do one lesson per day in Esperanto, and I'm about halfway through the tree.  I've had very limited exposure to Esperanto prior to this, but I'd say that the language is very simple and quick to pick up.  I actually have some experience with German as well and Esperanto feels like the missing link between German and Italian or German and Spanish.    As for how good it is, halfway through the tree?  I went to Project Gutenberg and looked at the stories of HC Andersen in Esperanto, and I can read and deduce sentences like:    ""Certe, ŝi estus vera edzino por mi!"" pensis la stansoldato, ""sed ŝi estas tre nobla, ŝi loĝas en palaco, mi havas nur skatoleton, kaj en ĝi ni estas jam dudek kvin, ne estas deca loko por ŝi! tamen, mi deziras konatiĝi kun ŝi!"" kaj jen li sin kuŝigis, tute longa kiel li estis, post flartabakujo, kiu staris sur la tablo; de tie li povis bone rigardi la noblan fraŭlineton, kiu senĉese staradis sur unu piedo sen malekvilibriĝi.   There's still some words I'm not clear on, but that's a matter of learning vocabulary.  Honestly, if you have any interest in the language, the course is worth a look.  Cheers."
duolingo,3a7u3f,LaurensEduard,5,Thu Jun 18 02:54:02 2015 UTC,It only took you three weeks? Now I'm interested. I might have to try the course out myself. Maybe do a 6 week Esperanto challenge.
duolingo,3a7u3f,autowikibot,2,Thu Jun 18 08:35:55 2015 UTC,"I commented in another thread -  I think that a goal of doing this course in 8 weeks would be very reasonable, and that pretty much anybody could do it in 12 weeks.  So  if  you  can  do  it  6  weeks,  IMHO   you'd be  ahead   of the average.  :-)"

duolingo,3a7u3f,GregHullender,4,Thu Jun 18 08:46:40 2015 UTC,"Propaedeutic value of Esperanto:       The propaedeutic value of Esperanto is the benefit that using Esperanto as an introduction to foreign language study has on the teaching of subsequent foreign languages. Several studies, such as that of Helmar Frank at the University of Paderborn and the San Marino International Academy of Sciences, have concluded that one year of Esperanto in school, which produces an ability equivalent to what the average pupil reaches with European national languages after six to seven years of study, improves the ability of the pupil to learn a target language when compared to pupils who spent the entire time learning the target language. In other words, studying Esperanto for one year and then, say, French for three results in greater proficiency in French than studying French for four years.

The only explanation I could think of is that these programs are really old, thus not taken seriously. It's a shame that Esperanto has become so insignificant that no scholar wants to do a modern version of these experiments in schools nowadays. I personally love languages, but couldn't get a hold on them in school, but I think an Esperanto basis would have helped me a lot. Now many years later I've learned Esperanto and I really notice how much easier other languages are coming to me! Esperanto is a propaedeutic wonder!  And a bonus is that your can easily finish the Esperanto tree in a month! Go go go!"

For me some of the languages is about a genuine interest in the language, which is why I completed Spanish, German, Danish, and Swedish.  I also have books for all of those languages and I put time outside of Duolingo into all of those languages.  So those are all of interest to me, and Duo helps me lay the groundwork.    Others are because I wanted to see what they were about.  I started learning Turkish but I've back-burnered it for now because I wanted to learn Norwegian and that's launched, so I'm doing that more now.  Also, I'm doing Esperanto because I've got a passing interest in the language, and it's a short tree, so I might as well complete it.  French I started because I had a friend who was doing it as well and they quit.  I continued on for a while, but I've paused it since.

I've been using Duolingo every so often for a while now, but I'm currently on a three day streak and want to start using it regularly along with Memrise.  Norwegian is at level 3 as this is the language I am currently learning.  French is at level 3 as it is the closest thing I have to a second language.  Danish is at level 1 but I haven't tried it for a while as I don't want to confuse myself with any words that are different between it and Norwegian.  Swedish I haven't tried yet, but like Danish I don't want to get confused.  Out of the others, I found the Latin languages to be rather easy, whilst Turkish and Ukrainian were the hardest."

I have a lot of downtime at work sometimes which accounts for the days when it spikes.   I will say this - one of my languages, I have a hazy background in. I find myself intuitively learning 'new' words because I knew them a long time ago and forgot them. But for my other language, which is brand new to me, I have a lot of trouble with retention (especially grammatical rules) just like you. I keep a pad filled with things I write down as I'm doing the lessons, which helps me. I don't find myself referring back to the paper, it's just the writing it down that helps me.   I also cover up the word banks on the ""translate this sentence"" exercises with my thumb and try to retrieve things from memory before I 'peek'. That also makes a big difference for me."
duolingo,3a60pk,xenawarriorfrycook,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:49:49 2015 UTC,"I skip 2 or 3 days every week to let the seemingly random skill bars drop and make everything gold with 2 new modules every time I log on(~30 minutes).   /u/xenawarriorfrycook makes a good point with writing stuff down as you go and if you haven't tried it then give it a go. I also use what I have learned by rambling throughout the day in the target language. The rambling seems to have a positive effect on locking it into long term memory, because I will also dream in the target language.   Just take your time and find ways to take it off of the computer screen. Maybe do the same module twice in one day with a lengthy rest interval in between. Do stupid things like wondering if ""Est-ce votre voiture verte va vite?"" has ever been uttered by a native speaker. But whatever you decide it has to be enjoyable."
duolingo,3a60pk,lurningstough,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:06:36 2015 UTC,It's been a little over a week and I've started with 20XP. I use Memrise too for 15mins each day. I'm starting small because I tend to get bored of something if I do too much at once. My main goal is to remain consistent.
duolingo,3a60pk,strawberry192,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:20:36 2015 UTC,"I've been spending long enough to get 80xp (or as close as I can get, damn you 9xp practices, ruining a nice straight graph) a day for the past month or so, which seems to be working quite well. Writing down all the new words from lessons and reviewing them before I go to sleep really helps retention though- on days when I forgot to review, the words seem to be forgotten more easily."
duolingo,3a60pk,ZX-Spektrum,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:17:55 2015 UTC,"I had the same issue until I started using flashcards via memrise to memorize the vocabulary. Currently I'm doing about 1.5 hours of German a day between the two with ~60xp in duolingo and ~13k in memrise. I find that if I miss a few days I start losing everything quickly so I prioritize getting practice in to maintain a streak even if it's in the ""easier"" lessons. I'm about one lesson behind in memrise from duolingo as I find it easier to remember words when I have the context from.  In addition I also do an extra long day of practice on the weekend (2-4 hours)  to strengthen any weak points which I notice during the week, generally grammar, pronunciation and looking for clarification between similarly translated words. I also use this time to listen to German podcasts or youtube videos to try to better immerse myself in the language."
duolingo,3a60pk,froseph85,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:56:03 2015 UTC,"I think 30 min a day is good for progress in one language, but at least do a little review everyday if nothing else. I memorize vocab from practicing lessons. After I finish a skill, I usually review the whole skill 1-3 times. If I feel my vocab is getting weak, I'll do a bunch of General Practices or find the skills that give me trouble & practice those.  I think learning from reverse courses might be fun for people who enjoy challenge & using intuition. I wanted to try learning Indonesian, so I started the ""English from Indonesian"" course a couple weeks ago & it's been worthwhile. I try to understand the discussion boards as I practice -- and learn a lot of synonyms there. Well so far I find it pretty easy to pick up Indonesian, but I suspect this method would be significantly more difficult for Polish (it seems complicated). lol"

I do my streak during lunch at work. I'm at work most days. There have been some very close calls at weekends, including just changing the coach settings to 1 point so I'd be able to complete that day.  The routine is re-gold everything and then get into new stuff if I have time. With the recent change to how skill strength is calculated I've spent most of my time trying to re-gold everything.

I recently finished the Spanish tree, but it took my a few years and at least 3 serious attempts. When you first come back, it seems like you know nothing, but you actually remember some. You can do the reviews and catch up to where you were, then proceed.  That said, if you want to restart completely, what you really need is a new email address. Do you GMail? If so, it's really easy: Change the number of periods (full stops) in your email name. If you were Ben.Nikiolajew before, be BenNikolajew now.

I have used duolingo and finished all except the last tier of german (mostly due to learning through other means at this point). Quite honestly many topics don't give you nearly enough information on how to construct sentences using that element of the language. A lot of it comes down to do the lessons for a while until you get a rhythm for it. But if duolingo did a better job at giving the 'formula' I'd pick up a lesson much faster.   Probably the most offending example would be prepositions in german. [Haven't done any other language in duo too extensively so I can't speak to their efficacy.] For those unfamiliar with german prepositions can take either the accusative, dative, or both. The lesson in no way shows you what prepositions are accusative, which are dative, and which are two-way. Nor does it say anything on how to determine which case to use for the two-way prepositions. It simply leaves the user to a trial and error fashion, then check the comments for someone more knowledgeable to tell they why it's wrong. Not a good way of learning the language."

The Memrise Basic Dutch 1 course tackles it by slowly introducing the rules, one at a time.  It could be better, but I had a solid understanding after finishing the two hour course.  There's also a very helpful and understandable table at the conclusion.  Duolingo Dutch is just a clusterfuck in comparison, and makes the concept far harder than it actually is.

Here's a quote I found, from Approaches and Methods in Language Teaching:    [T]hough it may be true to say that the Grammar-Translation Method is still widely practiced, it has no advocates. It is a method for which there is no theory. There is no literature that offers a rationale or justification for it or that attempts to relate it to issues in linguistics, psychology, or educational theory.   I powered through all of Duolingo's French tree, and I learned very little. Sure, it was better than nothing, and I did bang a few words into my head, but...I'm learning Chinese now and even if Duo was available in Chinese I would not use it.   I understand that Duolingo, by virtue of being what it is, has some limitations. Fairly severe limitations. But even so, it should be more innovative than it is. People talk about Duolingo as if it's this amazing new tool that can rocket you to about an intermediate level in mere months.   It's not. By itself, you learn very little in terms of the practical skills. Duo doesn't help you learn how to write, how to listen, or how to speak a language. Some people treat it as if it's a complete tool when it should never be anything but a little side thing for fun. The only differences between Duolingo and the stereotypically bad language classes that people take in school are the game elements and the fun format.   I would suggest to Duolingo that Luis stop thinking that pure number-crunching can create the ultimate learning system and actually hire some linguists who specialize in second language acquisition and teaching languages and can redesign it as a more effective tool.   If this sounds harsh it's because I used to be one of the people who thought Duo was great. It was actually someone on the site, one of the course contributors for the Russian course, that pointed out some of the inadequacies of Duo (besides the obvious like poor grammar explanations, hideous unnatural robot voices, etc). I guess with the amount of time that I had, Duolingo wasn't the worst thing, but now that I understand a little more about language learning, I can't say I would recommend it."

duolingo,39xnew,NessThunder,8,Tue Jun 16 01:11:18 2015 UTC,"They fulfill different roles. Duolingo is excellent at teaching basic grammar and translation of whole sentences, listening and reading skills. Memrise is perfect for practicing your vocabulary, something Duolingo is really bad at. Memrise is also usable offline on mobile, which is great when you are travelling or only use wifi. As far as their learning algorithms go, Memrise has no falloff, so eventually you will get overwhelmed by the repetition. Duolingo seems to value practicing words over grammar, so if you are skilled enough, you will simply outgrow it."
duolingo,39xnew,Zaphid,3,Mon Jun 15 17:25:29 2015 UTC,"They're completely different.  Memrise is a modern, algorithm-based 'flash card' memorization system.  It is there primarily to aid you in learning individual words.  Duo is there to give you an sense and some sort of idea of how the language is used.  Duo gives you many, many example sentences and makes you figure out the meaning.  There's also really no substitute in memrise for the community discussion in Duo. For however good as Duo's computer-coded system might be, it doesn't come close to providing enough explanation as to grammar points- the community interactions can help provide this.  Memrise doesn't try to teach grammar or language usage.  It is completely static - if you miss one letter in a memrise answer, the answer is wrong, and there's no interpretation available.    Duo is a good low level base and memrise is a great memorization tool."

You should use both, and then you should use more. There is only so much Duolingo can do for you."
duolingo,39xnew,Amputee_Fetish,2,Mon Jun 15 23:40:31 2015 UTC,I don't see them in competition as Duo could be with babbel or Rosetta's Stone but the thing I like about memrise is that it helps you remembering difficult words by associations with images or sentences and I found that very helpful and working even in the long term.  With Duo you just have to memorize them and so I forget things more easily.
duolingo,39xnew,roffnar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:14:19 2015 UTC,"My biggest complaint of memrise is some courses don't require accents. Accents can sometimes completely change what the word means.

Sometimes I'll misspell the word on purpose just to see where the accent is."

Still try really hard to find a native speaker to talk to. You will be super nervous, but get over it, the other speaker will understand and try to work with you and the small conversation will be worth more than a whole week in duolingo.   As for other resources.  https://www.youtube.com/trendsdashboard#loc0=pri  This lets you view what is trending in other countries. Really useful because you get really involved in a countries pop culture and it becomes easier to speak the language  https://www.busuu.com/enc/  Busuu is another language learning site that is not as good as duolingo but has a really great feature that I wish Duolingo would put in. Learners can speak with natives through ""Busuu talk."" It is really great because you can practice your German with a native speaker and they can practice their English with you too.   Finally, just try and immerse yourself in the language as much as possible. Change your computer and your phone into that language. Listen to music in that language. Read kids books in that language. Watch movies and youtube videos in that language. But more valuable than anything is still speaking with a native. Good luck with your language learning!"

For Spanish, I've used the free grammar guide on StudySpanish.com (I did not pay for anything), along with an easy spanish reader. Then I moved on to novels (translations as well as novels published in Spanish) and other native media, ranging from online news sites to TV shows, and even ""let's plays"" (although the Spanish youtube ""scene"" can't hold a candle to its German counterpart, imo.)  Also, for the 3000-ish first words, I used Anki sentence flashcards along with conjugation cards and some English->Spanish cards (for dates, numbers, days of the week, some technical terms, names of countries, etc.)  I'm currently doing the Dutch course, but I still don't treat Duo as the main aspect of my learning. The only language that I learn through Duo alone atm is Esperanto.  Personally, I percieve Duo as an intuitive and fun way to practice writing and getting used to the basics of the langauge's grammar (gender agreement was a thing that duo helped me greatly with.)

There are a lot of resources on YouTube also that help with pronunciation and listening. I've heard of people working along with Memrise too, but it's not something I've really looked into myself.

duolingo,39spie,Floatzel98,4,Sun Jun 14 11:41:34 2015 UTC,"Clitics in Italian are easy because they all follow a logical rule. Perhaps it might be difficult to use them in a conversation, it's a bit difficult even for me, a native speaker, so I think they need much practice, but when you use them correctly you'll sound like a mother tongue! I've never done the Italian tree obviously, so I don't know what kind of clitics there are. If you are referring to the clitics that comes after a verb, here are some expamples:  Verb dare, to give. Imperative tense, 2nd person singular: dai. So: ""(you) give it"" is translated as ""dai"", ""give it TO ME"" is translated as ""dai A ME"", but almost always is used a clitic, so the translation is ""damMI"", because the clitic ""mi"" is referring to myself. If I wanted to say ""(you) give it TO HIM"", I'd say ""daGLI"", and so on. Those clitic particles, in the Italian grammar, express the ""complemento di termine"", which I don't know how to translate because it doesn't exist in English, but basically it has the same meaning as the particle to + a noun in English.  So you now know that ""(you) give it TO ME"" can be translated as ""damMI"", but if you wanted to say ""(you) give THAT to me"", you'd say ""dammi QUELLO"", but there is often used a clitic too, so it becomes ""dammeLO"". It should have been ""dammiLO"" but it would sound very bad for us, so the ""i"" is transformed into an ""e"". The ""lo"" clitic particle express the ""complemento oggetto"", the object of a sentence.  I hope you understood, if there's anything else you don't clearly understand just ask me, I'll be glad to help you. :)"

duolingo,39qkz9,smokeshack,11,Sat Jun 13 23:41:01 2015 UTC,The problem is that translations into the language you're learning aren't worth much to them.

duolingo,39qkz9,smokeshack,4,Mon Jun 15 09:51:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't trust a bunch of random volunteers to know about the entire field of second language acquisition. Being bilingual doesn't guarantee that a person knows anything about the actual science of how languages are learned.  I was once one of them, trying in vain to make the Japanese course better than awful. I actually do have an MA in linguistics and studied SLA for both English and Japanese acquisition, but I had absolutely no capacity as a volunteer to address the fundamental problems with Duolingo as a learning tool. It gives no instruction on phonology (the sound system of the language). It gives extremely limited explicit instruction on syntactic forms. It gives no instruction on how words are formed from smaller units. It provides no tools for teaching a student to study the writing system of their target language. It demands no real, communicative output, only translation of (frequently dubious) phrases.  None of which is to say that Duolingo is a bad tool. It's just a woefully incomplete tool. If they came out and said, ""here is a tool for making grammar drilling slightly less boring, use this to supplement a communicative course"", then I'd have a lot higher opinion of it. But their insistence on misusing terminology like 'fluency' and 'immersion' tells me that they're much more concerned with making a marketable tool, rather than an effective tool. That's a shame, because the market is absolutely flooded with well-marketed, ineffective tools. I'd love to have a well-made online study aid that I could recommend to learners."
duolingo,39qkz9,Zeebuss,26,Mon Jun 15 10:07:42 2015 UTC,"Duolingo makes money through the translating in the Immersion program.

Duolingo are a business who market crowdsourced translations on the same kind of basis that Luis's previous product did (ReCaptcha for human OCR). The language courses are therefore aimed at getting users to be good at translating text, not the whole range of skills needed for real language proficiency.  Of course, any resource will lack in some area, so diversifying your sources of information is a good way to make sure you're learning all the skills you need to become proficient in Spanish (or whichever language you might be trying to learn)."
duolingo,39qkz9,ARandomCypriot,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:08:53 2015 UTC,"I think you have it a bit backwards. Duolingo is an excellent supplement, but the core of your learning should involve receiving and transmitting real messages from real people. Read novels, write memos, listen to news radio, talk to people. The kind of practice Duolingo gives you is helpful, but it's neither necessary nor sufficient for acquiring a language. Spend most of your time communicating, and supplement that with grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and other 'crunchy' kinds of study."

Most of the trees I've checked have 350-375 units (if it says ""Animals 7/10"" I call that one subject and ten units).  If you do one new unit a day, you'll finish the tree in a year.

Sure, some research suggests that people find listening to a woman's voice easier, which is why digital voices are so often female. I think it is far more important, however, that they continue working on expanding their courses (both by offering more courses and by adding more content to the existing courses) and improving overall quality."
duolingo,39p57i,Talked10101,27,Sat Jun 13 11:49:38 2015 UTC,"I thought the course was overall pretty good. The audio was very clear and there was a logical progression through the course introducing all the cases at different points. The vocabulary was very limited and I have heard a lot smaller than other duolingo courses, but you will pick up plenty of new words.  There was some drawbacks, I already know a fair bit of Russian so a lot of the grammar was already quite clear to me, I did not use any of the lesson notes. So I don't know how well the course would teach you grammar had you no introduction to Slavic grammars. The majority of the people who seem to have got towards the end of the tree have had a base of another Slavic language.   Being still in Beta, there some bugs still there but they seem to have sorted a lot of stuff out already. At times you can tell that there was no native English speakers on the Ukrainian team, as some of the accepted translations were slightly odd.    Overall, a good course. I could see it being frustrating for non-Slavic speakers at times, and I imagine you would have to spend a lot of time with the lesson notes or other grammar sources. I intend to work through a Ukrainian textbook now I have finished."
duolingo,39p57i,nikkisa,3,Sat Jun 13 11:54:28 2015 UTC,"Go for it! I think it's a good course! Definitely worth trying it out if your interested in the Ukrainian language, I wanted to start learning Ukrainian a few months ago and the course definitely got me started nicely!"
duolingo,39p57i,flootzavut,3,Sat Jun 13 14:38:30 2015 UTC,"Well done!   A question. How similar is Ukrainian to Russian? I've had people tell me it's almost identical to others saying they're completely different.   I'm 100% fluent in Bulgarian so I'm guessing I'll have an advantage over those who aren't (alphabet is very similar).   I think I'm going to wait for Russian to come out though, since my dad can speak it fluently and I can use him for practice."
duolingo,39p57i,nikkisa,5,Sat Jun 13 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine who is a native speaker of BG has been studying RU and has been sending me emails in Russian which I've replied to in Russian. I think she's been able to understand my responses significantly better than the average beginner would have. She's a good linguist anyway, but the Slavic language boost ain't to be sniffed at. I imagine it'll help you a lot.  I don't think there's a massive amount of overlap, and the fact Russian has six cases versus one makes it quite a different experience, but my impression at least is that you will get a significant leg up from Bulgarian. Not least that things like aspect will be natural to you, which for a non Slavic language speaker are really hard!"

And I typoed common words way more times than I should have.  I'd say I'm reading at about 50%.

duolingo,39qed3,SepulchreOfPetrichor,8,Sat Jun 13 19:08:23 2015 UTC,"My theory (and a lot of other people's theory) is that initially they put more resources into English for whatever speakers first with the intention of using the same teams to make reverse courses after the English course is out of beta. This is supported by the fact that Russian for English speakers and Hindi for English speakers entered the incubator after the corresponding English courses graduated beta. Some of the lesser known languages that have become available in beta could be for two reasons: 1) There is more demand for a course for English speakers to learn these languages than speakers of these languages to learn English (Irish, Esperanto, Klingon, Norwegian, Swedish are all good examples), or 2) there was a change in policy and they are making more courses for English speakers first with the reverses to follow. Either way, they already have teams working on English for Arabic (and Chinese and Japanese) speakers, and these teams will likely be used to make the reverse courses once these courses graduate from beta."

Additional helpful resources: listen to Spanish language radio, watch Spanish language TV and movies (turn on the Spanish, not English, subtitles if available) and read Spanish websites or newspapers.   I don't have it right in front of me, but I found a Spanish grammar book that's bilingual; one side of the page explains the rules in Spanish and the other in English. Also, get a Spanish/English dictionary and a Spanish only dictionary, like Larousse's. You can also find Spanish flash cards from several different publishers.   And, as you go throughout your day, try to describe in your mind what you're doing or working with in Spanish. If you pick something up, think of the Spanish word for it. If you don't know it, look it up. (It's amazing how many common household objects are never included in language learning.)

You can guess quite a few of the words you don't know from the context, especially if it's a book you know well. and it's rewarding to feel it steadily getting easier, chapter by chapter.  More recently, i've been having fun with the hellotalk app. It connects you with people who speak your target language so you can have conversations and learn from each other.

The best introductory textbook for Russian is Essentials of Russian by Gronicka. You can get a used copy for a penny plus shipping. It's a wonderful introduction that eases you into cases and provides you with plenty of exercises to reinforce them. The book's a little old, but the language is still mostly fine, at least for basic stuff.  After that, I'd suggest The New Penguin Russian Course. It's more advanced and features more modern language.  The Assimil courses are great resources for hearing lots of Russian audio, and you should get them. The '70s version is especially excellent. The '80s version is so-so. The '00s version is an improvement over the '80s one, but not quite as good as the '70s. The '00s version has more modern-style language, though. The new Assimil Advanced Russian Course (from ~2013?) is quite good too for when you get that high."
duolingo,39hwnx,tendeuchen,16,Fri Jun 12 05:16:16 2015 UTC,"I am a Russian Lit. M.A. (left program before finishing Ph.D.). I have taught Russian at university level. I love Duolingo for Spanish. But I have serious trouble imagining any way to learn Russian (or Ukrainian) like this. Formal study of grammar is unavoidable for an adult learner. Get some grammar charts or a basic grammar book at the very least. This may not be a popular opinion around here, but this grammarless method is just not well suited to certain languages. You won't even get to the point of putting together relatively simple sentences without it."
duolingo,39hwnx,inter_rusticos,7,Fri Jun 12 01:29:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed the nuances of conjugation will be difficult to get across, much less declension of nouns and adjectives."
duolingo,39hwnx,middiefrosh,4,Fri Jun 12 02:04:06 2015 UTC,"I'm minoring in German at uni, which is from what I understand a great deal easier than Russian grammatically, yet I still have a hard time imagining someone learning cohesive German (or any such language) without formally studying its grammar - especially from people who come from a caseless, genderless language like English or the like. That's just my personal opinion, though."
duolingo,39hwnx,MagneticBadger,5,Fri Jun 12 03:41:26 2015 UTC,"Russian has more conjugations, but word order in German is IMO the hardest part, and that's almost absent in Russian.  Also, Russian gender is determined by a word's spelling, so it's trivial to remember a word's gender 99% of the time.  The two languages are difficult for different reasons, at least in my experience studying both of them at a college level."
duolingo,39hwnx,zorba1994,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:29:35 2015 UTC,Wow. Russian actually sounds surprisingly like Latin to me. Now that was a rough language. Thankfully it was a reading only course. I would die trying to speak with so many cases and stuff.
duolingo,39hwnx,MagneticBadger,2,Fri Jun 12 14:56:46 2015 UTC,"Do you use the Tips and Notes feature on Duo? I find that to be very helpful.   But anyway, I'm glad to see the Russkiy Mir is working. (I kid, I kid!) If Duolingo can teach me to read Cyrillic, I'll be very impressed."
duolingo,39hwnx,felinebeeline,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:40:22 2015 UTC,"I have to strongly agree. I think the only way you can seriously get anything out of the Ukrainian course is if you have some base in another Slavic language. I know if I had no Russian, even completing many of the sentences in the relatively simple Ukrainian course would have been a nightmare. I have heard that a lot of the people doing the course have been making very slow progress.  The Ukrainian course also completely ignores the declining of adjectives and often try's to keep the grammar as simple as possible."

duolingo,39hwnx,destiriser,3,Fri Jun 12 09:15:20 2015 UTC,"Nothing even close to what is necessary, unfortunately. Paradigms of declensions and conjugations are just the beginning, by the way. Verbal aspect and verbs of motions have syntactic complexity that blow learning cases and declensions out of the water in difficulty. And what's really important to understand is that even very simple sentences require knowledge of fairly complex syntactical rules. With Spanish, I can actually hope to get through Duolingo and have a very basic conversation in Spanish. That is not a realistic possibility with Slavic languages."
duolingo,39hwnx,inter_rusticos,2,Fri Jun 12 13:59:16 2015 UTC,"Nothing even close to what is necessary, unfortunately.   But enough to get through the course, I suspect. What is the deal, do you have some irrational fear that everyone is going to take the course and at the end of it think that they are proficient in the language? (And if they do, so what!)"
duolingo,39hwnx,vprsnk,2,Fri Jun 12 21:16:28 2015 UTC,"They are going to get through a course that is ultimately nothing but a waste of their time. It's not a matter of my fear. Think of it as a public service announcement: you're wasting your time if you think you can learn even the basics of a highly inflected, syntactically complex language like Russian, Ukrainian, or Polish through a system that skips formal grammar study."
duolingo,39hwnx,inter_rusticos,3,Fri Jun 12 23:19:01 2015 UTC,There's no reason someone can't do Duolingo and a  grammar-focused course as well.  Sometimes a taste of the language is needed to provide motivation.
duolingo,39hwnx,Horizontal_Hodl,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:24:39 2015 UTC,"That was his point. If you want to learn the language, Duolingo probably won't be enough."

Honestly, Duolingo on its own not teaching that much is incredibly self-evident - and that goes for the Romance and Germanic languages that are commonly studied on the site.  But it's free and fun and it helps when part of a broader study program."

duolingo,39hwnx,destiriser,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"Basing it off of other courses. Russian grammar has more complexity than the romance languages, and without a lot of time spent on the grammar, then you won't have enough understanding of the language to extrapolate it into more vocabulary. Duolingo, as of yet, does not have the correct format to facilitate grammar-intensive learning."
duolingo,39hwnx,middiefrosh,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:12:44 2015 UTC,"Again. I agree, if the Ukrainian course is anything to go on, if I had did not already have a base in Russian and it's grammar I think I would feel very lost. This is with the Ukrainian course totally ignoring the declension of adjectives.  It also seems to me that the majority of people that have progressed towards the end of the Ukrainian tree already have some grounding in one of the Slavic languages. I have a feeling it may be the same way with the Russian tree. Though I got a lot of value from the Ukrainian tree, but I don't feel I would have if I hadn't already had a basis in Russian."
duolingo,39hwnx,Talked10101,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:52:06 2015 UTC,"I would tend to agree regarding the UK tree, but I think it may be a mistake to assume that the Russian tree will necessarily have the same issues. I feel like the UK tree is unnecessarily simplified to make it easier to get through, I get the impression the Russian team are not doing this.  Regardless, I'm not going to judge it till I've seen it.  To be honest, I don't think DL is or should be treated as a one stop shop for any language, even one as simple as Esperanto. I don't think that makes it a waste of time."
duolingo,39hwnx,flootzavut,2,Sun Jun 14 18:11:28 2015 UTC,Nope but I'm sure it will help. Get some basic vocab then read a familiar text with a parallel English translation - that's quite helpful too

duolingo,39b45l,MauriceReeves,3,Wed Jun 10 17:26:03 2015 UTC,"I imagine it would because there's no standardized Westernization of the script that fills in.  When IM'ing most Hindi speakers I know just spell things phonetically and there's some variation.  The nice thing is that Devanagari is largely regular and phonetic, so you pronounce what you see.  There are certain characters that combine to form new characters, called conjuncts, but they're not that common, and once you've got the base script down it's pretty easy to figure out the combinations.  You usually only see them in loan words."

duolingo,39e8vq,kirigirisu,3,Sun Jun 14 02:36:43 2015 UTC,"I've been studying latin for 2 years at high school, because in most high schools in Italy we study ancient latin (and I'm going to study it for 3 more years - it's interesting but a bit tedious and much time-consuming!). I've already studied all the grammar and in the next three years we're only going to do lots of translations (""versioni"" in our youth-italian language).  The grammar itself is not too difficult: being able to memorize all the declensions, conjugations, and all the verbal tenses is crucial; it's more or less like German: there are different cases, three genres, adjectives have to agree with the noun they're referring to, and prepositions + cases form complements. But there are 6 cases in Latin, 2 more than in German, and it's not only like adding an ""-n"" or an ""-en"", it's like changing from ""corpus"" (""the body"") to ""corporibus"" (""the bodies"" in dative/ablative case), And of course there are too many irregularities, for example: ""vis"" (""the force, the strenght"") in genitive case is ""roboris"" (""of the force""). Completely changed! And there are various forms of conjugations, such as active and passive periphrastic...  I think Latin is not a language that can be studied on Duolingo. In fact, the way we study Latin at school is different from how we study English: we learn to SPEAK English, and we learn to COMPREHEND and TRANSLATE Latin. Of course if you've got a huge memory and grammatical skills you'll be able to speak Latin after some practice, because after all it was made by ancient Romans to be spoken, but it's not suited to be on Duolingo. Anyway, that's just my opinion. I think Latin is really helpful for learning other languages, it gives you a big grammatical knowledge over romance languages and even germanic ones, and every other language involving cases."
duolingo,39e8vq,PazEr80,2,Thu Jun 11 22:53:47 2015 UTC,"But there are 6 cases in Latin, 2 more than in German   It's been a while since I studied it, but seven, surely? Nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, vocative, locative?  EDIT: Just read up on how rare the locative actually is, so I'll allow it. Just this once, I'll allow it."
duolingo,39e8vq,EstherHarshom,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:43:27 2015 UTC,"Actually, in the form of Latin I've studied, the cases are 6. Locative case is completely absorbed by the ablative, with the exception of few nouns that preserve the ancient locative, but it's considered an alternative form of the ablative, not a case on his own. For example: domus, 4th declension, on ablative is domu, but if it's used to express a place complement, you'll use the alternative form domo."

Word order isn't quite a free-for-all and there are common stylistic conventions, but it's still very, very flexible. That means a whole lot of acceptable translations.  I'd love to see Latin on Duo. There aren't many engaging learning resources for it because of the way it's typically taught.  I learned far more about how languages--especially Indo-European ones--can work from learning about Latin. I took it before I started German. There was nothing in German grammar that phased me after 4 semesters of Latin. Esperanto is like learning to doggy-paddle. Latin is sink-or-swim. If you can handle it, you can handle any other IE language.  Latin was seriously a lot of fun and there is some amazing literature to read. We read part of Ovid's Metamorphoses. That dude could paint an image in your mind with verse like no other. And Catullus... He's like your friend who can't stop pining over some girl and who threatens to face-f*** his haters, but he's got a lot of redeeming qualities. And there's Vergil, Sallust, Plautus, and Horace... Man, I feel like breaking out my Latin reader.  Edit: Asterisks to dial the vulgarity of the translation of a term down a bit, even though it's a pretty good translation."

It's less about demand or importance of a language, and more about the availability of contributors. Duolingo courses are made for free by volunteers meaning they have to find contributors who are 1. adequately skilled in the target language and 2. willing to work without compensation.  Seeing as there are such few fluent speakers of Latin (requiring years and years of study), you can imagine it's hard to find skilled Latin speakers in the first place, and even harder to convince them to work for free :)"

duolingo,39adg9,jemesct,2,Wed Jun 10 13:42:12 2015 UTC,"For sure.   My understanding of how duolingo works (please correct me if I've misunderstood) is that doing the overall strengthen takes from the whole pool of words you're learning and you strengthen 7(?) words. Those words could be from all over the skills you've learnt, whereas doing it from a specific skill obviously targets the weak words in that skill so you're more likely to increase that skill. You would get there eventually it's just harder to get those select words to strengthen from a specific skill to make it golden.   Hope this helps."
duolingo,39adg9,Brissot,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:20:38 2015 UTC,"Just adding on what has already been said;  In my experience strengthening sometimes doesn't make any gold, but sometimes I've had 4 simultaneously strengthen to gold. The reason why it sometimes doesn't is because some words you may not have come across for a long time, so whenever I strengthen widely I seem to refresh really early lessons or phrases like 'ich bin ein Mann', rather than the weakened skills. It's quite frustrating but has it's advantages and disadvantages I guess."
duolingo,3996zf,AnimalCrackersSuck,7,Wed Jun 10 04:03:53 2015 UTC,"I've definitely noticed it too. I've been counting lately how much French I'm actually typing in a lesson with ~18 exercises. Sometimes it's 2 or 3, sometimes nothing at all. The multiple choice ones are easy enough to guess. I'm flying through the course at this rate but I doubt I'm retaining much of the vocabulary. When I go back to strengthen it's pretty balanced though."
duolingo,3996zf,bellmouth,3,Wed Jun 10 14:52:06 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I haven't noticed that.  Totally anecdotally, I find there's usually kind of a pattern to it - a usual lesson for me is like   Any picture exercises come first - these are common in lessons that just build new vocabulary Then I usually have a series of target language -> base language sentences that add new words Then I usually have a mix of translating base language -> target language, and the ""type what you hear"" events (I have the microphone off, so I never get that kind) After a while of these, I start getting a random mix of all the previous questions, particularly if I've made mistakes and therefore need more questions to build up the progress bar"

I'm hoping I'll get more translations later and that Duolingo is starting me slow by focusing on translations, but I still wish they wouldn't because you learn faster by producing in my experience.  Still I'm OK with it since my ultimate goal is to be able to read and watch movies. And I think you'll eventually pick the language up from there, once you reach that point."

duolingo,3996zf,Amputee_Fetish,4,Fri Jun 12 15:35:31 2015 UTC,I've picked up on it as well. I think it's because Duolingo ultimately wants you to translate articles in the target language into English.

They also have their own ""percentage until beta"" thing, it was at 80% a month ago, and at 73% in January. So 7 percentage points in 4 months.  I wouldn't expect Hungarian to come out this summer.

Way to go making it more difficult for myself and wrong at the same time. That was a special kind of stupid.  In Esperanto I keep parsing ni as a negative and mi as we, which can quickly make a mess of a sentence. And then there's me misreading ludi to play as люди ljudi = people, which again, makes some sentences really peculiar...

duolingo,3934ng,ghostofpennwast,4,Tue Jun 9 05:12:23 2015 UTC,"I'm really enjoying it, actually! There's something really very fun about a language where you can jump in and start talking/writing so fast. One of my absolute favourite things that's peculiar to Duolingo and to Esperanto (so far as I've seen, anyway) is that the discussion threads for a lot of the sentences are full of people who a fortnight ago were beginners, lacking confident, or literally had never read or spoken a word of EO in their lives, talking and even making jokes and quoting movies in Esperanto. I mean, I'm not talking high-falutin', complex sentences all over the place with perfect grammar, but actual communication in a very short space of time. That's been really fun to see.   To compare, from my POV, with Ukrainian, where I had the big ol' crutch of Russian to help me out, I've seen hardly anyone who didn't already speak at least one Slavic language attempting to write anything in it (I don't think I've been on the UK forum much the last few days so people might be gaining confidence) and I know personally when I try, I feel like I still have so many gaps between what I want to say and what I'm actually able to say.   Even in the other language forums, people actually talking in the target language seems much more unusual and more common in people who are either really hardcore language learners or are at quite a high level. I just find it so interesting and encouraging to see people jumping in with EO and actually making jokes and having fun and stuff in the target language.  For me personally, I like how cleverly constructed it is. It's not perfect, but it's ingenious, and as someone who likes languages and also just likes words in general, it's fun to see how Zamenhof tackling trying to make it easier.   So... yeah, I'm an admitted language geek, but to me it's been really fun. I have no idea when or where I'll get a chance to use it, but it's been fun enough and easy enough that I am happy for it to be ""one day, hopefully"".  I... kind of feel like this post got away from me. Which I also feel like I'm saying a lot today... So I'm gonna shut up for now ;-p"

They need to train them, explain how everything works, explain their plans for the course, and spend the first couple of weeks looking over the new person's contributions to make sure that they are working. It would be even more time consuming to do this than it would be to work on the course a bunch themselves. There are some things where having more hands on deck will make the work go much faster, but for the build stage of Duolingo, I suspect it's better to have a small, dedicated core who know both how the system works and their plans for developing the course.

duolingo,38wram,Delstein,5,Sun Jun 7 16:04:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know, it's really hard picking a neutral monument and flag for a language that's spoken across a lot of different countries, like English, Spanish, and Portuguese. What's interesting to me is that they chose the most populous English-speaking nation's flag (USA) for the English course. However, the Spanish course is shown by the Spanish flag, and not the flag of the most populous Spanish-speaking nation, which would be Mexico. For Portuguese, though, they use the flag of Brazil and not the flag of Portugal."
duolingo,38wram,BiDo_Boss,9,Mon Jun 8 02:18:26 2015 UTC,"This is what Luis von Ahn, co-founder and CEO of Duolingo, said when asked about this very issue:   Unfortunately, there is no great way to do this. The real problem is our usage of flags to represent languages because there isn't a 1-1 mapping between the two (some countries speak multiple languages, and some languages are spoken in multiple countries).  We chose the US and Brazilian flags because we teach those variants of the languages, because they have the overwhelming majority of the speakers, and because they are the variants that most people want to learn (sorry chaps!).  The Spanish flag is trickier. We teach a Spanish that is closer to Latin American Spanish, but being a continent, Latin America does not have a flag, nor a clearly dominant country. Some have suggested we use the Mexican flag, but we don't specifically teach Mexican Spanish, and unfortunately the Mexican flag looks like the Italian one. We decided to stick with the most recognized flag to signify Spanish (the one from Spain)."

duolingo,38wram,dchirs,6,Sun Jun 7 18:44:27 2015 UTC,Definitely much easier to implement than Mandarin - it's Indo-European!
duolingo,38wram,Delstein,3,Sun Jun 7 23:33:20 2015 UTC,There's still humongous variation within the Indo-European language family. Think about the differences between English and German--it's like the differences between a horse and a zebra (both Germanic/equine respectively). Now think about the differences between English and Russian--that's like a horse vs. a chimpanzee (both Indo-European/mammals respectively).
duolingo,38wram,dchirs,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:41:17 2015 UTC,"Of course there is, but having studied Hindi, I was surprised both by how natural the grammar seemed (as a native English speaker) and the presence of cognates to other Indo-European languages.  Compared to Mandarin, whose tonality and writing system would likely require some reworking of the Duolingo internals, implementing Hindi seems relatively simple (which would just require implementing devanagari, not much harder than cyrillic.)"

At least the Seokguram Grotto is iconic, very cultural, and has a very interesting background (The Buddha statue there is influenced by Greek art). Plus, it is a UNESCO Heritage site.   P.S.

duolingo,38t28r,Kithsander,5,Sun Jun 7 00:38:09 2015 UTC,"Das schreckliche Mädchen - technically Nazi related, but takes place many decades after the war, no war scenes or anything.  Lola Rennt - known as ""Run Lola Run"" in English. It's a good 90s movie. You will learn the German for ""the bag"" very thoroughly from this movie.  Music videos by die Prinzen are good. I like ""Millionär"" and ""Be Cool, Speak Deutsch.""  If you're into classical music, Schubert's setting of Goethe's poem ""Der Erlkonig"" is great, if you dig harder stuff, Rammstein has intelligible lyrics.   Kraftwerk makes German tunes."
duolingo,38t28r,saekla,2,Sun Jun 7 01:45:54 2015 UTC,"If you get on german netflix there are a few modern german TV series. Der Tatortreiniger is a comedy series about a crime scene cleaner. Then there is Mord mit Aussicht, which I haven't seen any of yet, but it's a pretty highly rated series on imdb. Also, I find Bernd das Brot to be hilarious."
duolingo,38t28r,Fortheloveoffighting,2,Sun Jun 7 12:58:55 2015 UTC,"I saw a little bit about using proxy servers to change your source region, but I've two issues about that. 1) More importantly, I use someone elses Netflix account. Would that cause them problems? 2) I've no idea how to do any of that."
duolingo,38t28r,Kithsander,2,Sun Jun 7 13:06:55 2015 UTC,"I use a program called Hola unblocker. As far as I know, it shouldn't cause any problems. I also use it to watch Archer in German on occasion, although I'm a little disappointed by the German voice actor for Archer. Oh, almost forgot, Disney movies in German are excellent. I really enjoyed Der Konig der Löwen and Die Eiskönigen. Seriously, Seid Bereit is amazing."
duolingo,38t28r,Fortheloveoffighting,2,Sun Jun 7 13:22:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks, again! I could be wrong but I thought I saw something in the last week about Hola installing a bunch of back door software on computers. I'm guessing I'm wrong about this if you're recommending it but just want to be sure."

duolingo,38t28r,indil47,2,Sat Jun 6 21:13:46 2015 UTC,"I second the memrise.  I've been doing this concurrently with duolingo--I find it easiest to work ahead in memrise, then go back and complete the duolingo lesson.  Getting the sound and spelling in your head makes it so much easier to put it into context, as opposed to doing all three at once on duolingo.  Good luck, OP!"
duolingo,38t28r,ARandomCypriot,2,Sun Jun 7 02:44:21 2015 UTC,"Okay. Most European languages categorize their nouns (anything you can put 'the' or 'a' before, and it will make sense. eg: the desk) into genders.  In German there are three genders - masculine, feminine, and neutral. Masculine nouns will use the article 'der' (the) and 'ein' (a). Feminine nouns will use the article 'die' (the) and 'eine' (a). Neutral nouns will use the article 'das' (the) and 'ein' (a).  I like to learn using stupid / funny things. Males always give each other stupid dares, right? So the word associated with masculine is DER (pronounced similarly to dare).  There are some rules to know when a noun is masculine, feminine, or neutral. Personally I feel its a bit of a waste of time to learn these rules - its better to learn every noun with their gender. For example you might learn the word for 'book', Buch. You need to learn this new word with its gender (neutral) so you should memorize 'das Buch'.  Hope this helped :)"
duolingo,38t28r,PanningForSalt,3,Sun Jun 7 10:25:08 2015 UTC,"One rule that is good is that -chen is always nuter. So you can sound insane but correct by reffering to the ""cute"" forms of everyhing."
duolingo,38rghl,Orromog,8,Sat Jun 6 04:29:54 2015 UTC,On Ubuntu there's an option to use a phonetic Ukrainian keyboard so for the most part you're just typing the equivalent letters. It's really easy to get started with
duolingo,38rghl,nightclown,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:03:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a phonetic layout for Windows too (I can upload one if anyone's interested). Why anyone wants to be bothered learning a whole new keyboard layout is beyond me. I mean, it's not like you can't set a computer in Ukraine to use any keyboard layout you wish."
duolingo,38rghl,tendeuchen,3,Sat Jun 6 21:09:25 2015 UTC,"I learned it in case I ever travel to another country, because they don't use the phonetic layouts in Ukraine or Russia for example. So I learned the classic Russian layout. It's slow at first, but gets better."
duolingo,38rghl,shaggy814,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:44:27 2015 UTC,"But...I mean... They use Windows computers...so, unless you're using a typewriter, all you'd have to do is go to 'language preferences' and change it to the layout you already know. Unless you're unable to type without looking at the keys, in which case, that's a much more useful skill to learn than wasting time getting familiar with a brand new keyboard layout.   I put in a phonetic layout for Russian and was able to type at my normal speed from day one."
duolingo,38rghl,tendeuchen,3,Sat Jun 6 22:54:10 2015 UTC,"You are correct, but why fight with trying to add keyboards to phonetic when I can just simply learn the regular layout. I learned the classic Russian layout without stickers or a second keyboard in about a week, and it took me about another week to get reasonably proficient. Now I can type just as well, and I can get on an computer in Russia and type with no problem, and I don't have to try to find/install the phonetic layout. (honestly I don't use Windows anymore so I don't know if they include the phonetic layout, but they didn't in the past)  Just my two cents though.   I do see the merit of a phonetic layout though, don't get me wrong. Just that some people are willing to learn the original if they plan on travelling or moving to the country, to make life easier in the future!)"

duolingo,38pth9,Paiev,6,Fri Jun 5 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"The multiple choice questions are the worst IMO. It's try to review if I know how to say that ""the kids like to have their apples peeled and diced"" or something (i.e. something that's grammatically relatively complex), and only one of the alternatives contain the word for apple.  Also it tends to include words that they haven't gone through. If two alternatives contain ""en train"" I know that those aren't going to be correct because Duolingo hasn't told me what ""en train"" means yet.  I also think there should be more production excercises. Practicing translation is good and all, but I feel I'd have a lot easier to learn certain words if I was forced to produce them. Especially the words I have the most trouble with, which are conjunctions, prepositions and adverbs.  Actually, for words (though it doesn't work well with the ones that give me the most trouble) I tend to add everything to Anki. I feel I've got a lot better grasp at the words that've come up in Anki for the past week than Duolingo has given me in a month. Still love Duolingo for grammar, but for words it's absolutely hopeless and I actually wish they'd kept the vocabulary to a bare minimum. (except for grammatical words, which again are the ones I have the most trouble with)"

Yes! Good call -- this is another one that really annoys me.   I also think there should be more production exercises.   Yep, agreed. The sentence-level production exercises are like half the reason I use Duolingo in the first place, since it's hard to replicate them with other tools."
duolingo,38pth9,flootzavut,2,Sat Jun 6 16:39:38 2015 UTC,"Production exercises are good nods that said, I have seen people actually complain that there are too many exercises expecting them to produce sentences (I mean really?!); sometimes I think Duolingo is trying too hard to please everyone all of the time.   However, it is just a tool, and as tools go, it's a pretty nifty one!"
duolingo,38pth9,PrincesaCereza,6,Sun Jun 7 01:26:44 2015 UTC,"One complaint I have is that when you're in a lesson and you ""learn"" a new sentence. For example;  I am a girl - Soy una chica.  then the next sentence will be;  Soy una chica - I am a girl.  They should wait a few (new) sentences before they repeat it in the opposite language so you can let it sink in. You're obviously gonna remember the sentence after having seen it one second ago."
duolingo,38pth9,flootzavut,10,Sat Jun 6 18:02:28 2015 UTC,"""In Duolingo, when you learn new words, it doesn't begin with any instruction on what the word means""  There's actually evidence that memories are stronger when one first takes a guess at the word, even if the guess is wrong, and guessing at new vocabulary is a natural part of learning a language. That is not an aspect of Duolingo that is problematic, it's actually a pretty good way of presenting new vocab.  I don't really see the system's imperfections as a major problem, because Duolingo clearly isn't an all encompassing language learning extravaganza that will get a person to fluency without any other input, but I don't expect that of any system, program, website, etc...  The practice sessions can be kind of weird, but I usually do individual lesson reviews, which I think is more helpful most of the time anyway.  I do agree that the way the countdown keeps going between questions in timed practice is an oversight. I rarely use timed practice because I don't think it's very good, partly for this reason.  Ideally, there should be more ability for the devs to pick and choose the exercises appropriate to the language, which would definitely improve the practice sessions.  Overall, though, none of the issues bother me that much, tbh.  TL;DR: Duolingo is a tool, not a solution. It's imperfect, but so is everything."
duolingo,38pth9,Zarorg,5,Sat Jun 6 14:24:39 2015 UTC,"It's imperfect, but so is everything.    That has got to be the most cop-out reason for a product not to be improved that I've ever heard."
duolingo,38pth9,tallerthanunicorngod,9,Sat Jun 6 19:05:31 2015 UTC,"He's not saying they shouldn't improve it, but if I had to take a guess making a language learning program seems like it would be very difficult, and it's rarely straight forwards what will be an improvement and what will actually make it worse."
duolingo,38pth9,flootzavut,2,Sat Jun 6 20:18:30 2015 UTC,"Yup. I think Duolingo already suffers somewhat from trying to be too many things at once.  IMO, in an ideal world there would be more controls (for both devs and users, maybe?) as to what exercises came up. Some people are happy to chip away slowly or just get a passive knowledge of a language, but those who wanted to amp things up could make things more challenging.   I don't know how easy/possible that would be to implement. I do think that allowing the devs to make some choices about which exercises - or maybe about the proportion of each kind of exercise - would be grand.   For example, listening exercises in Esperanto? Honestly seem kind of pointless. It's so phonetic and regular that being able to listen to the audio (which is incredible clear on that course) and reproduce it doesn't really say anything about comprehension. Whereas with Ukrainian, say, where a lot of people are encountering Cyrillic for the first time, being able to accurately write what you hear, I can see that being relatively useful.  I also wish the multiple choice ones presented closer wrong answers. Sometimes the wrong answer is so wildly wrong that it's a bit too obvious which one is correct!   I think both the drop down menu ones and the ""pick the right translation(s)"" ones have their place, but I would dearly love to have more control over what exercises I got, or at least for the devs to be able to enable/disable exercises for a particular sentence where it was inappropriate, for example.  But again, I have no idea how feasible that is. As it stands, I'd rather have imperfect Duolingo than have them messing with it so much that it stops being useful. They seem to do A/B tests all the time, and I can't imagine you can run too many of those at once without seriously skewing/messing up the feedback data that was the whole point of doing the test in the first place.  I'm also honestly leery of people saying ""X would make Duolingo soooo much better"", because a lot of the time when I see people making those kinds of pronouncements, I think ye gods, I hope DL are not listening 8-o   (Personal priority: I really hope that releasing bonus skills in the newer languages is on their radar, because I'm dying to see what totally cheesy and awful flirting sentences are available to me outside of the original handful of languages! But I am aware that's kind of silly of me...)  Hmm, this got pretty TL;DR, as well, but yeah, essentially, I'd rather Duolingo changed things slower than tried to implement a whole bunch of changes/please everyone all the time and ended up making the thing unusable. As it stands, it ain't perfect, but it is, IMO, a great tool which I will continue to use."
duolingo,38pth9,flootzavut,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:55:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because obviously when I said it isn't perfect but nothing is, what I meant was that it was set in stone and no one should ever try to change it or better it. Even though I overtly agreed with some of the OP's points.  headdesk Geez, I guess you took TL;DR literally, huh?"
duolingo,38pth9,Zeebuss,4,Sun Jun 7 01:23:26 2015 UTC,I agree on many points. It seems like Duolingo is spending a lot of its energy right now getting all of these new languages up and going - which is cool- but neglecting that many fundamentals are still wonky or broken. Those should be fixed before adding to the complexity with more languages.

duolingo,38p2rz,Habefiet,17,Fri Jun 5 17:44:15 2015 UTC,"Hi all!  It seems it has become somewhat customary to post completion on this subreddit.  There are often questions relayed to the newly-finished folks.  Figured I might as well nip that in the bud and write a little about my experience.  That quickly turned into writing a lot about my experience.  Even if no one reads it, it gave me some closure to sum it all up like this, so go me.  Onward! My language-learning history: I took three years of French in high school (I last took it in eleventh grade—I am now at the end of my first year of a Master’s program, so it’s been a good six years since then).  I did not enjoy it and did not learn much at all despite getting A’s in the course for the duration.  I have retained very little, partly from lack of use and partly because I simply didn’t ever learn very much.  I always thought this was mostly on my end from sheer apathy but after having taken a shine to Spanish and learned a fair bit in a short stretch of time I’ve begun to think that my French teacher, though quite pleasant and entertaining, was in fact not very good.  I’m a little annoyed at myself for taking this long to notice it, because I’m usually quite good at identifying which teachers are genuinely good and which teachers are just good at hoodwinking people into thinking they are good.  Anyway, prior to Duolingo I had no other experience in any other language besides what I’ve described. What I’ve done: --Finished the whole main tree.  I haven’t done the bonus skills yet and I also haven’t done any translating. --I have kept my tree gold.  I have never, that I can recall, gone on to learn something new while I still had skills in need of reviewing. --This took a little under six months.  I have maintained a streak for the duration, but used about 7 streak freezes back in February during a rough patch in life.  Some days I’ve done no new lessons and only a couple minutes of quickie review just to get the points—some days I’ve done tons of new lessons and some review to boot.  I would guess that my average on a given day is something like 20-30 minutes.  Hard to say for sure though, it’s quite variable. --I am Level 15 with 7985 experience. What my current skills are: --Regarding reading, there are full, lengthy, complex sentences in my Spanish copy of Harry Potter y el prisionero de Azkaban that I can read with minimal difficulty.  There are also a lot of sentences that I can’t.  This is mostly an issue of vocab—Duolingo is lacking a lot of words needed for fluency, including some pretty simple / obvious ones.  However, this is partly an issue of not knowing things Duolingo was ostensibly teaching me.  These are primarily grammar troubles—I would say I know the vast majority of the roots Duolingo contained, it’s just putting them all together in a complex sentence that rapidly becomes difficult. --Listening is hard.  There are sentences I should be able to identify that I simply can’t without playing it back a couple of times to parse everything out.  I am not a good listener.  Not that Duolingo teaches this much anyway, but be aware (in case you aren’t) that recognizing words in text does NOT equate to recognizing them in conversational speech. --Production is hard.  Written is of course easier than verbal since I have as much time as I want for written.  Complex grammatical stuff is effectively impossible for me at this time, but give me a while to put something relatively simple together and sure, I can do it.  I’ll even sound pretty good. What I like: --The order of the first half of the course.  It’s structured very well to give you a good introduction to the way the language works while also introducing useful vocabulary.  I’ve never seen any language materials organized so well to give you the very basics of a language so quickly. --How well it works for vocab, particularly nouns and verbs, and for that basic grammar.  Learning most of this was a breeze all things considered. --The aesthetic.  Simple and clean instead of flashy, messy, and cluttered. --Gamifying things with experience, shiny gilded areas of completion, etc.  Mindless and secretly pointless, but fun nonetheless. --It’s free.  Hard to beat that price for a tool as useful as this. What I don’t like: --The order of the back half of the course.  A lot of complex grammatical structures get introduced all at once without basically any opportunity for practice. --The vast majority of utterances continuing to be simple present tense (we get way less practice at other tenses than we should) and lacking in some of those weird grammatical structures.  There’s also a real lack of basically everything besides nouns and verbs as things go on.  It seems like we see a lot of the nouns and verbs again eventually, but only specific adverbs and adjectives and other stuffs get the spotlight while most are never really seen again.  That’s how it felt, at least. --The new fluency meter is painfully dumb.  For those not a part of this particular A/B test, the old post-lesson “You are now x% fluent!” message has been replaced by a big goofy symbol with a percentage in the middle that is constantly on your homepage, giving a different percentage than you were being given previously as it is based on a new formula.  It’s apparently based on how good Duolingo thinks you are at the various words you’ve learned.  This is patently ridiculous—there are many words Duolingo insists I do not know because I haven’t reviewed them in months when the reason I haven’t reviewed them is because I do know them, there are words it thinks I know because I’ve been exposed to them recently when I don’t actually know them well, it can’t differentiate meaningfully between whether I can produce them or only comprehend them, and in any case Duolingo will never make anyone fluent in Spanish (and I assume any other language) because of a simple lack of words so it’s a bit stupid to have any fluency measure without a big asterisk on it anyway. --I can’t prove this yet because I wasn’t taking data from beforehand and I have less exposures to the later stuff and etc. etc. anyway but I’m clearly part of an A/B test where you get wayyy less English->Spanish than you do Spanish->English than before and I feel confident that this is linked to a decreased rate of gain of my production skills. What I’m neutral towards: --The relative brevity of the course.  Keeps you motivated because it doesn’t seem impossibly long and progress is visible, but there’s a whole lot of vocab that Duolingo could help me learn that it doesn’t.  I’d love to see an “Advanced Duolingo” at some point for more vocab. --Not needing proper accents to get a point.  It’s nice to be able to move on for being mostly-correct, but it discourages actually learning where to put what accents, which can be a problem. --Lingots need a massive overhaul.  I’m part of the A/B test where you stop getting Lingots for streaks, as you can probably tell from my count.  Who cares?  There’s next to nothing to spend them on!  They’re basically just a different kind of experience points right now, another glorified nothingness, and it’s a waste of something that could be very cool and motivating. --All the A/B testing.  Trying out new features and changes and letting users experience them is cool.  Having to adjust to new stuff you don’t really like and having to do so pretty frequently is not.  Constant minor changes make the whole system feel unrefined and irritating. Other tools I’ve tried in the last couple weeks: --Anki, a flashcard system where you can design the cards for yourself and also rate yourself on how good a job you did at remembering it so that it can intelligently assign the delay until you get that card again, is incredible.  Download Anki now.  I had so much trouble with adverbs and I’m doing much better now. --I am personally not a big fan of Memrise.  It has different priorities from Duolingo—it is clearly designed, at least early on, to get you to be capable of extremely rote interactions in restaurants and on the streets in a Spanish-speaking country rather than really starting to teach you the language from the get-go.  I also find the rate of repetition there and the frequency of multiple choice questions to be excessive, irritating, and not actually helpful in the case of the multiple choice material since all you have to do is vaguely recognize the most related statement half the time.  If it works for you, awesome, but I don’t see myself going back to it. --I’ve found a few apps that are basically just weak vocab “games” but with a much larger vocab than Duolingo.  Some aren’t too bad.  I think I’ll be using these and then pretty immediately putting the new words into Anki. Do I recommend Duolingo: Absolutely!  Duolingo is not going to make you fluent in the language, so don’t tell yourself that it will.  It’s not a tool with that capability.  However, it is an excellent starting point.  Learning to at least comprehend most of the material presented is quick, easy, and reasonably enjoyable. Where I am going from here: Hard to say!  I think the plan for now is going to be to keep acquiring some more vocab through apps.  I am also planning to begin a full reading of el prisionero de Azkaban in earnest and use the ever-helpful Internet to get me through sentences I don’t understand (until I do understand future sentences like them).  I will be searching for enjoyable Spanish television programs to watch and/or listen to so I can work on that listening.  Production work is going to come after my overall comprehension is better than it is right now, I think. Good luck all future language learners!"

I'm doing French, Swedish, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish, German,ASL, and Ukrainian atm both with Duo and other resources so as you can imagine it gets a little hectic."
duolingo,38pdi4,CampBloodSurvivor,3,Fri Jun 5 18:49:07 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you've been doing so far, but you probably need exposure and practice as much as anything.    Services like Readlang and Lingua.ly can help you find reading material appropriate to your level, and if you encounter words you don't know, they can translate for you and save those words as flashcards. The Harry Potter series is also frequently recommended, since you probably know the story and the books start out at a reasonably easy level.    Netflix and Hulu have either dubbed or original Spanish content; I've been watching a romantic comedy series from Colombia and a dubbed zombie show.  There's also plenty of free foreign-language content on YouTube and Spotify.    For writing, some people like to keep a journal.  It can be like a diary where you write about your day, or you can use it to summarize the news articles you read and shows you watched, or whatever else works.  Personally, I do something like that, but I post it on Lang-8.com so natives can come by and comment or offer corrections.    If you've been using just Duolingo, speaking will probably need the most effort to catch up.  For a first encounter, I recommend hiring new a tutor through italki or Verbling. For more practice, sites like italki, wespeke, Coffeestrap, and the HelloTalk app can connect you to people who speak Spanish natively and want to practice their English, so you can help each other.  Verbling has group classes for English or Spanish where you can work on specific subjects or the teacher provides readings for you to discuss. You won't get as much speaking practice as you would with a solo class, but they're cheap ($2-3 per hour-long session) and I find them fun.    From these sources, I take about 20 words per day (you can do more or less) and make them into flashcards for later practice.  Ten words per day would be over 3,500 words in a year, which would give your vocabulary a lot more depth."

Taking a while, but it's great to have a native speaker right there with me."

duolingo,38oek5,jankdotnet,19,Fri Jun 5 15:09:34 2015 UTC,"That depends on your answer to ""Do you want to be able to speak Esperanto?""  It sounds like you're long past the point where it would give you the leg-up it can provide to beginners. That mostly just comes from gaining some confidence through early mastery, since it's easy to learn and less daunting to speak. So if you are already confident enough to speak some French, the only reason to learn Esperanto would be if you wanted to get into the culture; contrary to what some folks on this subreddit have said, that is a perfectly valid reason."
duolingo,38oek5,AssistingJarl,5,Fri Jun 5 15:17:49 2015 UTC,"It will not ruin your progress of French (if you keep practicing it, because forgetting is a thing everywhere). Esperanto is so regular that you will have a mental framework to keep the things together. It will not ""contaminate"" your french and if it does, there is often a good reason for it. Just keep this handy list of false friends in Esperanto.  Considering the fact that you still have 40 skills to go in the French tree (and considering the fact that french Duolingo is low level), I believe you can still win a lot of time by learning Esperanto first (or at the same time, it is possible if you put clear barriers : before dinner I do Esperanto, after dinner I do French.) The Esperanto tree has 44 skills and leads to a better level of fluency than the French tree. Iince you already know some French, you are going to flyyyyy over the Esperanto tree. With some new knowledge of Esperanto in mind, your French learning experience will be more enjoyable and will keep your motivation longer.  By the way. I am native French. Esperanto is my fourth language. Esperanto culture does not interest me. Esperanto did not help me to be fluent in French quicker but it does help me understand my own native language. For example many French people don't realize that a ""sourire"" (a smile) is a ""sous-rire"" (a little laugh, (""sous"" can also mean something lower in a hierarchy)). I know this because a smile in Esperanto is ""rid-et-o"" which literally means a little laugh. There is a difference between being fluent in language and understanding it. Before Esperanto, I was just fluently vomiting my French by imitating other Frenchmen without giving it more attention. Since Esperanto, I feel more comfortable and proud using my own native language. (I guess it is a perfectionist attitude.)  My advice is always the same : learn Esperanto as soon as you can. It is a breeze compared to any other language. You will understand your language(s) better and you will always have other benefits that no one can expect before learning it."
duolingo,38oek5,VanMerwan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:40:38 2015 UTC,"I believe you can still win a lot of time by learning Esperanto first   Are you a speaker of Esperanto? What kind of things do you think the OP or myself might come across in Esperanto that will help us with our French? I've been studying French solo for a few years (and having a background of French up to the high school level but still not able to speak the language for lack of actual time spent using it) and the OP said he has been studying for a few years. I can't know how much time he has dedicated, so I can't say for certain that he's encountered everything I have but I think a few years would be enough to do it.  If you are a speaker of Esperanto you know far more about it than I ever could only having spent the last week getting up to level 6 in the duolingo tree. But I have to say there's been nothing that has surprised me about Esperanto so far. I think I already get the concepts at a basic level due to my study of French. So how is Esperanto supposed to help me with French?  I hope I don't come across as rude, I'm mainly asking out of curiosity."
duolingo,38oek5,vprsnk,2,Sat Jun 6 00:09:07 2015 UTC,"With time and proficiency, you will start using Esperanto as a bridge/pivot language as a reflex whenever you have trouble translating thoughts into words.  It is often better to translate directly English <-> French because of common shared things such as some expressions or social values attached to the words. But doing also English <-> Esperanto <-> French in your mind will help you seeing and evaluating the tiny elements of what you are saying. (In Esperanto you have to look deeper at the roots due the agglutinative nature of the words and you can focus on it since everything else is more simple than for other languages). Digesting/Analysing sentences through Esperanto, you will have a more critical view of what you are trying to say and that can result in a better comprehension or more added precision to what you are saying.  In my everyday life, I randomly (sometimes somewhat unconsciously) translate my French, English, Spanish sentences into Esperanto. It makes me realizing new things, sometimes. It is fun when new knowledge pops in your brain while doing nothing in the bus. For example, I did not really care about the difference between that and this in English before trying to understand/translate the ĉi from Esperanto. And god I had so many English course since I am 5 years old. I was just missing the critical view."
duolingo,38oek5,VanMerwan,2,Sat Jun 6 08:03:45 2015 UTC,"Great observation. I hadn't thought of that. I guess I was under the impression that Esperanto was supposed to help me understand some of the concepts (like morphology, and so forth) which it would but I kind of already grasp that to a degree after exposure to French for so long. Thanks for taking the time out, it really enlightened me."
duolingo,38oek5,vprsnk,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:27:17 2015 UTC,"I heartily agree with this. The building-block structure of Esperanto has definitely helped me learn more about the structure of my native English grammar. Perhaps not to the extent of your French, but it is indeed noticeable."
duolingo,38oek5,Alsterwasser,0,Fri Jun 5 21:08:12 2015 UTC,"Eh, learning Latin would have helped you a lot more in that regard. ""To smile"" in Latin is surridere, with alternative form subridere, ridere means to laugh."

The grammar is so regular that you don't have to think too much about speaking.  A few successful interactions can be great for your confidence and help students get past that ""I'm not ready to speak yet"" hurdle.    As for timing, I don't think you need to rush into Esperanto.  If you want to take a break from French, two to four weeks of Esperanto could be a good way to do that and stay productive."

If not, try Esperanto now!  I've also been studying French solo a few years now and not made as much progress as I had hoped, having hit roadblocks much the same as you. At some point I realized if you just pick a course and stick to it you will make progress.  I've been working quite slowly at the French tree, doing a lot of skill strengthening exercises instead of new stuff. I get most of my new skills using Assimil.  I was waiting for the Esperanto course when it was still hatching, and when I found out it was ready for use I added it to my Duolingo account. I have been working daily on it. I would say if you've already got a bit of French (and you've been studying on an off for a few years) you probably don't need Esperanto if you're hoping to get a boost, at least not at a beginning level of Esperanto and a below-intermediate/false-beginner level of French. There's been nothing that has really surprised me in the Esperanto course. I'm on level 6 and have completed 16 things on the tree, with 28 left so I'm not that far in yet to really give you an idea of what to expect.  That said, I have found the Esperanto course to be tons of fun, really well done, and the language itself is great too! I do recommend trying Esperanto at Duolingo when you get a chance. If you think you can finish the French tree in about a month, by all means wait. If it's going to be a longer period of time, go for Esperanto. I'm not finishing the French tree anytime soon, but I will be chipping away at Esperanto until it is complete, and then who knows if I'll continue learning Esperanto or not. I'm thinking I might move on to lernu.net afterwards."

Esperanto is a low-stress-level language, and if you'd rather be doing nothing as opposed to studying the language you signed up for, then I suggest adding Esperanto to your courses and giving it a try. The people behind it know what they are doing. It is the most fun I've had on Duolingo! So I will be seeing this through, and completing the tree within the next week or two, then going back to square one and adding a little extra work to my routine. It doesn't matter whether I've sold you on it or not, because I'M having fun.  I'm also interested in Esperanto because it's a constructed language that people actually speak! Like Alsterwasser said, it's cool in a nerdy way."
duolingo,38l0gi,cunningjames,8,Sat Jun 6 14:29:52 2015 UTC,"You've already received what are probably the right answers. From my perspective, it's hard to get around two apparent facts:   Esperanto is almost certainly not going to succeed at its original intended purpose, to become a commonly-spoken international auxiliary language. So it's not of very much practical use. Esperanto is by design a not-very-interesting language; I'm not going to expand my brain or gain any new keen insights from skill in Esperanto (leaving aside the issue of whether Esperanto might have some use as a stepping stone to other languages -- that doesn't really apply to me at this point). So there doesn't seem to be any pedagogical reason for me to learn it.   So 'community' remains the only plausibly compelling story for why Esperanto might be worth someone's time. The answers already posted show that this is important for many people, but I'm unsure it appeals to me -- getting together to speak a not-very-interesting language with people who largely already speak English anyway ... it's probably not for me.  But don't let that stop you if you find it appealing!"
duolingo,38l0gi,esperantoyeahm8,7,Fri Jun 5 15:10:51 2015 UTC,"Hey that's cool. But I make the argument that Esperanto actually is pretty linguistically interesting. There's not much that is really unique about it, except for the fact that it is probably more agglutinative than any natural language. As an English and Australian sign language speaker I find that bizarre and wonderful. It's the freedom of being able to make up any word that allows you to really play around with the language. You can make up creative sentence structures that are still completely comprehensible to other fluent speakers.  I enjoy reading in Esperanto. Esperanto literature can be very creative. Esperanto also has a culture of pushing the boundaries of itself, because it was originally created with La Fundamento, the 16 rules of Esperanto grammar. Most of the language hadn't really been fleshed out in 1887 and has since evolved naturally, but few dare to deviate from the 16 rules. Instead, they push them as far as technically possible. It has led to an interesting evolution of the language."

People have tried putting numbers on the number of current speakers, but they vary so wildly that they're not worth paying attention to. As for the potential, it depends on how optimistic you are. It's been around for a hundred years and is still a pretty obscure community.  3 - http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaedeutic_value_of_Esperanto This article is more about the studies of how Esperanto helps students learn subsequent languages, but also delves into studies about how much easier it is to acquire than other languages.  4 - Two schools of thought on this: finvenkists are in it for the idealistic aspect of the language, raŭmists are more community-oriented. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finvenkismo"

On the other hand, if you just want to learn Cyrillic, it's probably fine.  Edit: As far as input goes, if you don't care how your keyboard looks then I strongly recommend adding Ukrainian input to your computer and just writing the characters on the keys with a sharpie.

Personally, I would recommend learning the cyrillic alphabet before starting the course, because it doesn't teach you the alphabet letter by letter in the course and instead just jumps into teaching you words (like ""мама, тато, тітка, дядько"") which might be confusing when it asks you to translate ""uncle"" (""дядько"") into Ukrainian and you know what it sounds like, but don't remember what it looks like.   I would suggest maybe trying the first unit if you're unsure of whether or not you want to start learning or not - worst case scenario, you just stop after one lesson ))"

For the switching alphabets, I have a Vaio touchscreen laptop and I use a wireless keyboard most of the time, but to type in Ukrainian I pull up the touchscreen keyboard, so I can see what the heck I am typing. Once you install the keyboard in Windows it's easy to switch back and forth with either the space bar or the little icon in the bottom right corner. I am looking forward to it going to mobile, though, since my iPhone automatically detects and switches keyboards.  It does throw you right in with the alphabet, but I think it's in a way that works well. My 8 year old is learning along with me and has learned to sound out the words pretty quickly just from having the same sounds thrown at us repeatedly each day in our review."
duolingo,38gi1f,icebirdlulamoon,2,Thu Jun 4 05:06:33 2015 UTC,"It's fun, they throw the Cyrillic at you fairly fast (actually a good thing IMO), it had a lot of bugs when I went through the tree - especially as they didn't have a native English speaker on the team so some of the 'correct' English answers were a bit shaky. I imagine that will be improving as more people get further through the tree.  I found it a little frustrating in that there's stuff I wanted to know that wasn't really covered or wasn't even really touched on, like comparatives and superlatives, imperatives, declension of adjectives. My impression is that it would give you a good grounding in the basics but there are a few gaps I personally would like to see filled in in later versions of the tree. I also found that the structure of the course felt a little haphazard at times. I've found some slightly frustrating gaps when I've tried to write stuff in Ukrainian.   Also there is an issue with some letters being accepted as interchangeable when they're really not, and apparently some people have been doing the course writing in Latin letters. I believe these last two things in particular are something the course contributors don't have any power to change, and are part of getting the kinks out of Duolingo coping with a new script: I think Ukrainian is the first 'from English' course that uses a script other than Latin.  Overall though, it was a fun, good intro to the basics, and I think as a basic grounding in the language, you could do a lot worse. The mods and some other native speakers have also put in a lot of effort providing links for further study, etc, and the forum seems to have a fair few people willing to help out.  Essentially, it's not perfect, but IMO it is worth doing.  Caveat, I came at it with a good level (albeit really rusty) of Russian, and also my first romp through the tree was over the course of about three days, so there may be things I missed, and similarly I had a leg up in understanding the grammar and I can't say for certain what it would be like to tackle things purely from the exercises and the tips and notes in this course."
duolingo,38gi1f,flootzavut,2,Thu Jun 4 13:47:42 2015 UTC,"With having some background in Russian I would agree. For instance the accusative case introduced around Level 4 of the course, and I had no problems with this due to prior knowledge of Russian.

duolingo,38gi1f,Talked10101,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:34:05 2015 UTC,"Yup, exactly. I mean, I mostly didn't even look at the tips and notes for a lot of the lessons, and so much of the grammar is similar that I didn't have to ""learn"" it in any real sense, even though strictly speaking I had never studied Ukrainian before. My exposure to the language prior to the DL course was very slight and very passive, but Russian was an enormous crutch.  It's very hard for me to judge what that would be like for a true beginner."

She studied Esperanto for one semester in her last year of university.   At the end of that semester she felt more competent and confident reading and writing in Esperanto than she did in English.   (My friend's native language, for the record, is Shanghainese, not one of the European tongues; and she did not learn Esperanto out of a hobbyist's interest, or to save the world, but because the authorities in her university ordered her to do so, against her own wishes. Not that she regrets it!)   http://esperanto.org/us/USEJ/world/kontraux.html  Writes  Claude Piron  (United Nations  translator,  psychotherapist,  Esperanto  advocate) -   When I observed communication in Esperanto in Eastern Asia, especially among Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese and Koreans, I made it a point to ask people how much time they had devoted to acquiring the language. Since I was comparing communication in international settings according to whether they used English only, simultaneous interpretation, consecutive interpretation or Esperanto, I asked the same question of people using a language other than their mother tongue.   Most of these Asians with a rather crippled English had devoted some 2000 hours to learning it; those who used Esperanto had studied it for less than 200 hours. Yet, their level was much superior whatever the criterion (fluency, lack of misunderstandings, spontaneity, nuances, humor, etc.).   Obviously, your conclusion is based on erroneous data. (See my research report ""Esperanto: l’image et la realite’"", Cours et études de Linguistique contrastive et appliquée No 66, Paris: Institut de Linguistique appliquée et de didactique des langues, University of Paris-8, 1987, and my book Le defi des langues, Paris: L’Harmattan, 1994, e.g. pp. 243-254; a review of this book can be found in Language in Society, 26 (1), 143-147, 1997).   http://claudepiron.free.fr/articlesenanglais/comments.htm"

duolingo,38ckil,spence5000,2,Thu Jun 4 04:22:19 2015 UTC,"I  just  ran  across  another  article that  seems  relevant -  [Edit:  Looks  like this  is  the  article that  /u/lapingvino  mentioned]  A  young Chinese guy  taught himself to read Esperanto in about 5 months    about 5 months ago, I randomly visited a webpage about Esperanto. By then, I had already studied English for 7-8 years, but I still couldn’t speak it fluently.   I took the free Esperanto course on the Internet and started to learn Esperanto.    If this  is the course that I think it is,  it's  a short ten-lesson basic course.  One  completes one lesson at a time  by oneself, and  sends  them to a volunteer  tutor to be  corrected.*     Taking the course, I personally experienced the ease, richness, precision and flexibility of Esperanto.   After about six weeks, when I finished all ten lessons of the course, I could already practically read any kind of book in Esperanto with the help of a dictionary and speak to others in simple sentences.  ... I found some instructional books, dictionaries and others about Esperanto and I immediately bought them without hesitating.    Thanks to the reading, I gradually started to enjoy Esperanto literature. Now, when I read a sentimental novel in Esperanto, I weep as it touches my heart. I really enjoy that.   I never felt that much joy when I read English books, even though I’ve studied English for 7-8 years and Esperanto for only 4-5 months.   http://blogs.transparent.com/esperanto/chinese-learns-esperanto-in-just-5-months/        * Here's  the  course  material  in  English - http://pacujo.net/esperanto/course/materialo/   Here's  the  sign-up  to receive feedback from a tutor,  plus the  same  course  offered for  speakers of other languages  - http://pacujo.net/esperanto/course/"

duolingo,38b209,pushbak,3,Wed Jun 3 04:48:50 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for the first question but the second and third are almost invariably no and no.  Duolingo is a beginners course. There is not nearly enough expressions, vocabulary, or grammar explanation for Duolingo to get someone to conversational fluency or understand other people speaking sentences longer than 8-9 words at normal speeds. That requires far more listening practice and exposition to casual conversation."

I can speak basic phrases, but not without hesitation and mental translation. I haven't listened yet to much natural French, but I imagine I'll have a tough time at first because Duolingo teaches Parisian French and Québécoise French is the most relevant to me.   My approach to using Duolingo has been twofold:   learn a minimal set of vocabulary to make basic communication possible, and learn, or infer, some common grammar rules and constructions to allow others to understand me.    What I have started to do in the past week or so is to start reading short stories and levelled novels to increase my exposure to French writing, keeping a notebook for me to journal and practice writing, learn more of the grammar that Duolingo glosses over or has introduced, and record myself speaking to converse with others. Duolingo can't make you fluent, but it can give you a starting point."

duolingo,38c8k1,Asyx,11,Wed Jun 3 13:46:56 2015 UTC,"They are both Indo-European. However, Irish does some interesting things that are very uncommon in other Indo-European languages. For example, Irish is VSO meaning verb-subject-object instead of English, which is SVO meaning subject-verb-object.  The spelling is also bullshit. You think English is bad? Or French? Irish makes me want to invent a time machine and burn down the fucking Roman Empire all on my own...  It's comparable to Polish or Russian, I'd say."
duolingo,38c8k1,SiddharthaWolf,3,Wed Jun 3 16:44:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed with Slavic languages in terms of grammatical difficulty, but at least Polish spelling/pronunciation is always logical even if it looks very weird to non-Poles at first.

duolingo,38c8k1,Themasteroflol,5,Fri Jun 5 10:48:32 2015 UTC,"There's /r/gaeilge which is a subreddit dedicated to Irish Gaelic. They got a list of resources you could use.   Irish is quite honestly a different beast from English in many ways, the most notable one being that it puts the verb first in a sentence.   If you know a bit about languages, you can often read up on how things work. So as long as you make sure that you know what verbs are, what nouns are, and what adjectives are, you can probably google the solution to most of your problems.   I've only completed a few lessons of the Irish course out of sheer interest, but it does seem like a decent course. It would definetely help you understand the language better and how it works, how you supplement this learning is up to you."
duolingo,38c8k1,BiddyCavit,4,Wed Jun 3 09:34:37 2015 UTC,"I learned Irish for 13 years in school, and I am nowhere near fluent. It is a very hard language to learn. Duolingo seems fine, but I have noticed a few of the pronunciations are a bit off. Otherwise it's fine. It has helped me to remember a lot of the Irish I was taught years ago, and I now realize that I am nowhere near as bad as I thought I was.  Even though Irish is a dying language, it's a beautiful one. Ireland has a beautiful history, and I think knowing the language helps you understand it a lot more. Plus, it would be wonderful to see the language come back to life!  Feel free to mail me if you have any questions! I'll root out my old school books and see if any of them have any websites mentioned that could help.  www.examinations.ie has a load of exam papers for the junior cert (taken by mostly 15 year olds) and the leaving cert (taken by people going to college).  They're good for practicing what you know. Not only do they have exam papers, but they also have a marking scheme and answers so you can grade yourself afterwards.  The leaving cert pages have more languages, but the junior cert papers are probably best for a beginner who is testing their knowledge. The leaving cert languages have Polish and Afrikaans and other less popular languages. They're pretty much used by foreigners who are trying to get points for college and don't have the Irish exam to do (foreigners are exempt from learning Irish in school, but it is mandatory for natives).  I hope my little essay helps! :)"

But remember, you will never NEED Irish, there is nowhere in ireland where people don't speak English as a first language. Even in Gaeltacht areas. I personally would not learn it as your first language, the pronunciation is hard for anyone, never mind someone who has never been exposed properly to Irish. So ya...

duolingo,388oei,ReedsAndSerpents,10,Tue Jun 2 17:04:09 2015 UTC,"Separating nouns and adjectives is simply incorrect grammar. Esperanto is flexible, but like most good things, it has its limits. As a fluent speaker, I can't even understand this sentence without puzzling it out and rearranging the words. Well, I would understand it just as well as its English counterpart: See beautiful gray the horse donkey.  But anyway, the most natural Esperanto is SVO, so we always accept that. Then we accept other orders when people report them if they are still correct sentences. It's just the easiest way to handle this situation considering how the Duolingo system works. Thank you for your understanding. :)"
duolingo,388oei,amuzulo,2,Tue Jun 2 21:16:11 2015 UTC,". It's just the easiest way to handle this situation considering how the Duolingo system works. Thank you for your understanding. :)   This is all that's really important as far as Duolingo is concerned. If it's too much of a pain to program that kind of thing/constantly correct it then the time is better served on the course itself imo.    Separating nouns and adjectives is simply incorrect grammar. Esperanto is flexible, but like most good things, it has its limits. As a fluent speaker, I can't even understand this sentence without puzzling it out and rearranging the words. Well, I would understand it just as well as its English counterpart: See beautiful gray the horse donkey.   This doesn't concern Duo per se so feel free to ignore. See, that's just the thing, the English counterpart is absolute nonsense because it has no cases. Barring prepositions (which as the name literally implies are placed beforehand) there's no reason for that sentence to be grammatically incorrect. If they match in case and number as they should, separating them has no consequence on their meaning.   If you said it was more difficult to teach or speak that way to English speakers, I would certainly agree. The sentence was chosen specifically to both showcase a difficult sentence and to highlight that word order has no effect on its meaning. Part of the allure of the language was, to me at least, that someone could adapt their own grammar to it without penalty, i.e. SOV or VOS or whatever they wanted and still be understood. ""La ĉevalo azenon vidas"" would make perfect sense to a native Japanese speaker. If for whatever reason adjectives were added first it would have no bearing on the sentence's meaning."
duolingo,388oei,amuzulo,5,Wed Jun 3 02:24:20 2015 UTC,"You can't just change the rules of a language because you want to. There's a good reason adjectives have to be next to what they modify, because it makes it more understandable. However yes, ""La ĉevalo azenon vidas."" is a great sentence. I understood it without any problem at all! Now, check out these examples:  La ĉevalo grizan azenon vidas. = The horse sees a gray donkey. La ĉevalo griza azenon vidas. = The gray horse sees a donkey.  That's actually a beautiful example of why Esperanto has the accusative and why adjectives have to agree with nouns."
duolingo,388oei,tendeuchen,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:00:16 2015 UTC,"The red circles are the nodes in this syntax tree that are the minimal units that need to be left intact in order for this sentence to make sense. If you break up these syntatic units, you're basically breaking the grammar. These three points represent the SVO order, but the three nodes can be arranged in any order in Esperanto.  (Key for diagram: S = Sentence, NP = Noun Phrase, Det = determiner, VP = Verb Phrase, V = Verb)"
duolingo,388oei,tendeuchen,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:05:04 2015 UTC,"The whole gist of my posts is that the NPs do not in fact have to be left intact for everything to make sense. The only bit that must follow is the la. Everything else can be rearranged with no change in meaning.   If you want to say that it's difficult to read, sure. Is it nonsensical? No, but it might look that way at first."
duolingo,388oei,44444444444444444445,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:50:10 2015 UTC,It breaks the syntax of Esperanto in the same way that the corresponding English sentence breaks the syntax of English. The phrase structure rules disallow a stranded AdjP and require that the AdjP be embedded within the NP.  It's like saying 4 + 2 x 3 = 14 because 4 x 3 = 12 and then 12 + 2 = 14.
duolingo,388oei,amuzulo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:21:04 2015 UTC,"As a fluent speaker, could you tell me if Esperanto allows for the use of implied parentheticals? As in... ""Vidas bela grizan [la ĉevalo] azenon."" Which is kind of what ""azenon"" implies. I know this is bad word order and perhaps a bad example."

The neutral word order is SVO, putting the adjective after the noun is not that common, and separating nouns and adjectives with other things like in ""Vidas bela grizan la ĉevalo azenon"" is extremely uncommon, not to mention difficult to understand."
duolingo,388oei,WildberryPrince,6,Tue Jun 2 17:48:31 2015 UTC,"I think that it is worth your time because they are correct. The Esperanto team probably just couldn't come up with all of the permutations of the word orderings so if you keep marking them as being correct, the team should be able to just accept that as a correct translation"
duolingo,388oei,amuzulo,3,Tue Jun 2 17:36:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with u/amuzulo here, Esperanto's word order is slightly more flexible than English's because of the accusative case, but it still has its limits.  I don't think I've ever seen any language, constructed or not, that allows you to separate adjectives from their nouns willy-nilly like that."
duolingo,388oei,44444444444444444445,0,Tue Jun 2 22:48:50 2015 UTC,"Like I said in the OP, Latin is this way. Much of the greatest poetry ever written paid no attention to word order. In fact Vergil used them masterfully for emphasis, to put them at prominent places in a passage even when the subject might be at the beginning the same way the word 'in' starts this one. Whether the Latin influence meant to copy this attribute to ease the grammar transition to Esperanto or it remains a quirk of said inheritance, the effect is the same. There is no semantic difference in moving the adjective around. Grizan can only describe the azenon in the sample sentence, there's no other word that can fit it.   I understand that it's confusing when you've never encountered something like it before but it becomes a practiced ease when you are regularly forced to."
duolingo,388oei,amuzulo,4,Wed Jun 3 02:32:47 2015 UTC,"Whoa now, you never mentioned poetry before. That's a different issue entirely. At that point you're really stretching a language and pushing its limits and yes, at times, even breaking rules. Pretty much anything goes in poetry. :)"

I can introduce myself, explain my immediate needs and tell you a limited amount of things about my environment in German, and duolingo pegs me as 33% fluent.  At best maybe a progress meter for the course, but without any context, I'm not a fan of it.  At best it'll be ignored, but I can easily see someone becoming disappointed when duolingo says they ought to be 75% fluent or even 100% fluent in their target language and they still have a hard time holding a conversation or reading a novel.  More savvy users will realize it's bunk, but I'm sure there will be plenty of disappointment and frustration to stem from it."
duolingo,387sy6,shikitohno,5,Tue Jun 2 16:12:56 2015 UTC,"According to an employee, it accounts for how many words you know and how well, so it'll improve with practice and decay with time.  It sounds like a more dynamic version of their ""you can read x% of real French"" claim.  On the one hand, the number's a lot squishier than before, but it's probably more realistic.  Knowing 90% of the words in a text is certainly a good start, but that's not the same thing as 90% comprehension because you're still _______ some of the most  __________ words."
duolingo,387sy6,krnm,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"But they don't seem to take advanced learners into consideration. I'm currently using Duolingo to supplement my grammar in Spanish while living abroad, so instead of boring myself with basic words, I was able to jump as far as the last tier.

duolingo,387sy6,DamaOscuraDeTodos,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:28:29 2015 UTC,Which actually makes sense.  How is it supposed to know how many of the words you know if you never did them?  The only test would be to do all the lessons in order with no mistakes and see where it pegs you.
duolingo,387sy6,butcher99,3,Thu Jul 16 17:52:21 2015 UTC,"Very unclear. The fluency score is only given for the five original languages (Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese), and finishing a tree gets you to 50-64%, which varies by tree. It doesn't seem to simply be a measure of how many words you've learned either, since in some cases I'm seeing higher %s for trees that teach fewer words. I agree that this score is probably more confusing or detrimental than useful."

In my case I see ""no_lingot_streak_reward: true"" and sure enough, I stopped receiving the lingot streak reward when they started the original AB test.  Yours may now show the same thing.  The easier way to check this particular one is to go to your lingot store and see if, at the bottom, it says you can earn lingots for streaks.  If it doesn't, you no longer get them."

duolingo,387ay9,myxopyxo,7,Tue Jun 2 10:52:14 2015 UTC,"I'm a linguist currently working on a dissertation about Japanese writing, and how it compares to other writing systems.  I kind of agree with what I think is your basic approach: Learning phonology, vocabulary and grammar is something independent from writing, and should be held as more basic and more important than it.  However, I don’t think it’s a bad idea for Duolingo to use phonological writing systems like Cyrillic or Hangul, because these are actually quite easy to learn.  I taught myself runes in a week, Greek writing (not the language) in half a week.  I once read a novel by Helen DeWitt, and later could identify my destination in Arabic in the airport.   I'm no super genius, by the way, anyone can do this; I teach a classroom of 14-year-olds with a spotty history of public education, and my classicist friends taught'em all to read Greek characters without any trouble (certainly a lot easier than teaching them algebra). Duolingo doesn't have to drill the characters themselves; with the spoken audio and the repetition, an user should have them mostly cemented by the first checkpoint.  If they're having trouble, they can always use an external application, like the one you used.  The only phonological writing systems that pose some difficulty are English and French—I wish they'd include phonetic transcriptions together with the highly irregular, unpredictable spelling, but it seems that IPA scares people (for some reason I can't fathom).  At any rate, even in the case of these two weird writing systems, paying attention to the audio should help with most troubles.  However, writing systems based on morphemes (today that’s only Chinese and Japanese) have too much symbols to memorize, which significantly slows down vocabulary acquisition—you shouldn't have to memorize yet another character before you can start learning a new word.  Natives start learning those characters after acquiring the grammar and basic vocabulary, and I think this first step is what Duo is better suited for.  They could display the Chinese characters if people ask for them, but in my opinion they should have full phonetic glosses (pīnyīn or furigana) and don’t even try to teach characters; just focus on vocab. You can drill your thousands of characters after earning your gold.  (For a longer discussion about Japanese, cf.)  TL;DR—writing systems are easy, let them be acquired organically (*Chinese and Japanese not included)."
duolingo,387ay9,sansordhinn,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:40:41 2015 UTC,"Well, it would seem I've expressed myself badly because this is pretty much what I meant. I think.  I think we need a system to practice the writing system, but I don't think it should be integrated to the tree and I think it should be optional. However the tree itself should be written entirely in the native writing system.  But the way I understood it, there will be lessons in just writing/reading in the new trees just like there are lessons in the French tree for forming negatives. I really don't believe Duolingo's system is suited for this, you need to get the basics simply from practicing the system in isolation and getting accostumed to it. Then you integrate it by practicing it while doing lessons.  For Japanese, I'm really skeptical about this working very well in Duolingo. I agree that grammar could be taught in the Duolingo modell, but I don't think it will work very well simply because Japanese sentences are pretty difficult to translate accurately and concicely to English. The semantic world of Japanese is too different from English. This may be fooder for /r/badlinguistics, but I've been studying Japanese for years myself and speak it fairly well but still have difficulties translating accurately. The times I do translate I tend to work more with overall meaning than words and sentences. However when practicing Duolingo it's almost word-for-word in the beginning and later on becoming somewhat more intuitive and more less word-for-word (however you still need to be very precise or Duolingo will fail you for obvious reasons). - All that said I'd be happy to have them prove me wrong. Especially if they want to teach me korean or mandarin which I presume will be similarily different in their ""semantic world"" compared to English."
duolingo,387ay9,flootzavut,2,Tue Jun 2 15:30:02 2015 UTC,"Not certain what you're suggesting. Learning a language like Russian or Ukrainian or Hebrew without learning how to read and write the alphabet is... not a good idea, frankly. It's like scuttling yourself before you even start. It's part of the language, the best way to deal is to grit the teeth and learn it, IMO.   I don't know if I've misunderstood your suggestion, but I think not integrating the writing system (do you mean typing in Latin letters?!) seems like a very peculiar idea."
duolingo,387ay9,flootzavut,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:04:53 2015 UTC,"Just that it shouldn't be part of the main tree. And not with the same method that all other Duolingo stuff is taught, it needs a specialized system."
duolingo,387ay9,flootzavut,3,Tue Jun 2 12:06:24 2015 UTC,"I still don't think I follow, to be honest. And certainly for relatively simple alphabets like Cyrillic and Greek, I don't see any necessity for teaching them separately. They don't take long to acquire, so why not acquire them as one goes and practise them from the start?  Even something relatively tricky (for an English speaker) like the Hebrew or Arabic scripts, or Japanese kana, is not so very hard that I think it requires a separate tree or part of the tree.   Japanese kanji and the Chinese system, yes, those are going to be trickier, but for regular, more or less phonetic alphabets? Not necessary.   As for ""when the student feels they need it"", if a person is learning Russian or Hebrew or etc in any way except the most dilettante-ish, casual, touristy way, they need the writing system to learn the language. They go hand in hand.   Some need more help than others (reading written Hebrew, for example, gets significantly easier once you start to understand the language), but I think artificially separating a language from its writing system (which seeks to be what you're suggesting, though I'm still not sure I've understood) is a terrible idea."

duolingo,380m4q,Bolcik,28,Sun May 31 23:44:50 2015 UTC,"At an international scale: improving communication between people (10x faster to learn than english) For children / at a national scale : propaedeutic value of esperanto, faster to learn esperanto+french than just french.   At a personal level if you already speak several languages   Support the ideas above (as texanconfederate pointed out). If you try to convince a monlingual friend to learn esperanto, you are much more convincing if you already speak it (plus, in this case you can helm them). Enjoying the support of the community: because many esperantists want their language to grow, they tend to be very friendly with other esperantists. For example, I have trouble finding hosts on couchsurfing... except with esperanto speakers which accept me most of the time. Speaking of that, the esperanto community created the ancestor of couchsurfing decades before internet: pasporta servo. Esperanto gatherings seem to be cool, I'll do my first this summer. For some people (apparently, not your case): being able to have a full conversation with a stranger. I have many friends who speak english well enough to read news articles/reddit/have a basic conversation. But they could not talk in english like they do in french. Learning esperanto, they could become more proficient in esperanto than they are in english and their third language (german or spanish for most of french) and have the pleasure to have a real conversation with someone coming from a different culture (although, if they speak esperanto they are likely to be relatively wealthy and very likely to be on the left side of politics, it limits your possibilities of meetings). As a researcher, I sometimes want to use a word which does not exist or is too vague in french (my native language). In many cases, I could create the word in esperanto. Then, when I read my notes months later, I see more precisely what I was thinking about. A very small bonus: as far as I know, esperanto is the only language in which the following works of Jack Vance are free (someone bought the rights for esperanto, translated them and provide them for free): http://esperanto.us/   But yeah, the main points to learn esperanto are the two first in my list, which do not concern you.

It seems to me that while this might carry well over several languages (e.g. easier for learning French, Spanish, and German) it would still be more efficient to just focus on french if that is the target language. Also I have heard the same thing about Latin (which is true to an extent, I have found my Latin classes to be helpful in learning Spanish and French).  Also, how does ""creating' a word in Esperanto work?"
duolingo,380m4q,yoyo456,7,Mon Jun 1 00:48:21 2015 UTC,"Well to answer your question of how to ""create"" a word in Esperanto, every part of speech has a specific ending so if you change the ending you are making a new word. For example, the Esperanto word ""patro"" means father but if I wanted to say to father (use it as a verb) I would replace the noun ending -o with the infinitive verb ending -i thus giving the word ""patri"", then you can add affixes onto the word to describe it instead of having to use separate words. To continue with our example ""patro"" you can add the affix -acx- (the x represents that there should be an accent over the c) which means something is awful, you can form the word ""patracxi"" (again same deal with the x) which would mean something like a terrible father."
duolingo,380m4q,ernesttg,4,Mon Jun 1 01:29:13 2015 UTC,"For the propaedeutic, no one knows for sure how it works. But the fact is backed up by experiments. Possible explanations are as follows:   When you learn your first foreign language, you learn the features (word, grammar,…) AND learn to learn a language. The first language is always the most difficult (I found english much more difficult to learn than hungarian and arabic which I'm trying to learn now because it was my first). With esperanto, you'll be soon at level where you can try to write/speak/think in a new language. For this point, it does not matter that esperanto is any close to the language. The only thing that matters is that it is fast. Even if your first target language is klingon or chinese, if you have never learned a language before, I'd advise you begin by esperanto (especially if you're a child, most studies are on children). The effect of latin is much smaller because, as any natural language, it is difficult. With esperanto, classes of words that may seem quite abstract to a child (adjectives, adverbs, nouns,...) may become easier to understand because they are explicited. This may be the reason why, in several studies (only the Paderborn one on the wikipedia page, but I remember some others also observed it in their complete report) learning esperanto help the children with their native language. Because learning esperanto is easy, people get more motivated to learn it. Then, they have a boost of self-confidence for the natural language. And because learning a second foreign language is easier than learning the first, the boost of confidence is maintained.   To give an example of what yoyo456 said about word creation: manĝi=to eat, manĝo=the meal, manĝaĵo=the food, manĝebla=edible, manĝilo=cutlery, manĝujo=plate, malmanĝi=to vomite, hommanĝulo=cannibal, matenmanĝi=""to have breakfast"", manĝema=""fond of eating"", manĝemulo=""someone who is fond of eating"", manĝejo=""the place where one eat"", manĝegi=""to eat a lot"", manĝado=""the process of eating"" (dum la manĝado venas apetito= the appetite comes while eating, translation of a french proverb, I don't know if it exists in english), ĉiomanĝanta=omnivorous, manĝilaro=""the set of cutlery that is used for something by opposition with one piece of cutlery"", kunmanĝanto=""person who is eating with you"", ungomanĝema=""adjective corresponding to a person who often eats one's nails"".   You can observe that all the esperanto words are based on the root ""manĝ"", plus some affixes and ending (""i"" for verbs, ""o"" for nouns, ""a"" for adjectives,...). When you've learn the list of affixes, every word you know gives you many words.  In the above list 13 words are obtained this way. The rest is obtained by combining words, for instance ""mateno""=""morning"", ""manĝo""=""meal"" -> ""matenmanĝo""=""breakfast"".  Not only it is easier to remember, but there are even words (in the end of the list) for which I don't have a single equivalent word in english. For such a trivial subject, circumlocutions are okay. When I write about abstract concept of computer science, I prefer to keep my sentences short, because it is easier to reread. I don't know how to distinguish ""manĝilo""=""cutlery"" and ""manĝilaro""=""set of cutlery"" in english, I'm not very sure of the precise meaning. Even in french (my native language), I can only make the difference with a plural, but it does not exactly capture the difference. Again, on such a trivial matter, there is rarely an ambiguity. When I compare various denotational semantics on interaction nets, I prefer to be precise."

At the regional level, some language are better suited as ""international language"". For example, in South America, Spanish will serve you better than English. On the global level, if you have to pick one world language, it is English.  Let's pretend that Esperanto is objectively easier to learn than English.

It would have been a tautology if I had written ""It's objectively easier to learn because it's objectively easier to learn."" I said the equivalent of ""It's easier to learn because that was the objective when designing it.""  I said a reader who hasn't encountered the word before, as in someone learning Esperanto who hasn't met that particular word before will still be able to pronounce it.  Someone learning English would struggle to pronounce many new words as the pronunciation is inconsistent and there are many exceptions.  I don't see why making it so that there are only six verb endings to learn (less information) as opposed to at least 45 endings in French with at least 200 exceptions (more information) makes it more difficult to express a concept.  It's roughly the equivalent of saying ""I goed there, I jumped and then I doed that."" (if that were grammatically correct) having the endings change in a predictable manner doesn't make it harder for someone to understand that you did those things in the past if anything it makes it easier for a learner than having to learn exceptions for very common verbs.  ""I went there, I jumped and then I did that."" is harder to learn because of the irregularities which mean you need more information (exceptions when changing tenses of certain verbs) to express the EXACT same concept.  Which is significantly harder to remember than the equivalent of add 'ed' to the stem to make the past tense.  The main difference is in most languages like English there are a lot of verbs you can't do that to.......flyed, runed, sayed, holded, eated................because even though you add 'ed' a lot of the time, you can't do it every time.  The simplicity of a language doesn't necessarily have a strong effect on how long it takes a baby to start talking.  At 7 months they can't understand the concept of no/stop let alone make an association between the sound and the expected reaction.  Globally children start responding between 8-12 months, this doesn't necessarily indicate all languages are of equal difficulty.  Also 'native' Esperanto children often hear it from only one person, and that person can and most likely often does speak another language.  Whereas 'native' English children typically hear the language from both parents, peers, strangers etc.  Having less time to learn something in doesn't generally make people learn it faster.  Even if Esperanto in itself doesn't become a global language, the propadeutic effect it has on learning other languages means it is still worth learning if only to learn another language faster."
duolingo,380m4q,LimeGreenTeknii,7,Fri Jun 5 15:35:00 2015 UTC,"If you put yourself in situations where you'd use Esperanto, its utility skyrockets.

You can also receive international visitors through the Pasporta Servo who might only speak Esperanto, discuss matters with the Esperanto community online, and read and translate Esperanto texts.

Finally, learning Esperanto can also prove valuable in helping to recognize different aspects of languages, their grammar, and how to improve learning other languages — even if you've already learned multiple other language.    All this said, while the focus of language learning is almost universally on a language's personal utility, we shouldn't forget that the beauty and novelty of a language and language learning can be worthwhile in and of itself.

There's actually been some discussion about it over at /r/lojban but I think the general consensus is that Duolingo's platform would be difficult to teach Lojban over because of how drastically different the grammar is. Every language on Duolingo has verbs, nouns, adjectives, and teaches the grammar as a secondary thing, while mainly focusing on vocabulary. While it would be possible to do that in Lojban, it would quickly get confusing the moment you want to make longer sentences.  In addition, with the way Lojban's syntax works, there are many, many ways to express even the most simplest of ideas. ""mi prami do"" and ""do zo'e prami fa mi"" mean the same thing, although the latter is needlessly more complicated. But it's not incorrect.  If you're interested in learning it sooner, there are a couple online courses that cover a lot of the information.

You seem to be at a highly motivated place right now. Motivation comes from a) goals we deem meaningful, b) momentum created by success, large or small, c) and other responsibilities not taking priority. With proper motivation, and enough dedication, you can pretty much learn anything. The good thing about motivation is that it grows exponentially: The more you succeed the more you are excited to succeed again!"

duolingo,37zoq7,myxopyxo,2,Mon Jun 1 12:09:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, prepositions, conjunctions, and adverbs are my weak areas as well. I think part of it's because you can communicate a lot of ideas just by knowing the basic conjunctions (and, or, if, because) and prepositions (on, about, etc). Adverbs aren't (usually!) semantically crucial to the message to be conveyed, either. I'm thinking it'll come by necessity when we're advanced enough to start communicating more complex ideas."
duolingo,37zoq7,flublublu,2,Mon Jun 1 15:12:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's probably something to that. I also think it might be due to these words being more abstract.

I think the closest one gets to ""this tree will be easy because that tree is already done"" is teaching the same language from a different language. Caveat, I'm not a contributor and my only comparison is Russian -> German and English -> German, but while obviously all the home language stuff is in a different language, as far as I've noticed, the structure of the tree, what it teaches and in what order, yadda yadda, is identical.   If you're teaching the same language from a different language, then you have a good starting point with the tree. Teaching Arabic from English, I'm guessing, will require a wildly different tree. A different and more opaque writing system, a different structure, an unrelated language, the way consonantal verbs work... I don't think that the way they teach English is going to help all that much."

duolingo,382i95,ReedsAndSerpents,6,Mon Jun 1 13:06:53 2015 UTC,"Ukrainian does a mostly good job when it comes to alphabet, except for some quirks, like accepting Latin alphabet or different letters in Cyrillic that have the same latinisation. It's a bit of a mess, but hopefully they'll fix it.  Arabic is more complex: (1) it's written from right to left, (2) it's not an alphabet, but an abjad, (3) and letters change shapes depending on the position of the word. The first problem can be solved by Yiddish, first two together can be solved by Hebrew, and the third one by Hindi (if it ever gets done)."

Easier, I imagine, to add one and work out the kinks, then go on to add, say, Arabic.  It's only relatively recent that even the forum started coping properly with Hebrew.  ETA: also, I don't know if they will be using purely Arabic script or what, but if they used any kind of romanisation even at the start, they would need to reconfigure things so that minuscule/majuscule were differentiated. I wonder if maybe, alongside the obvious publicity stunt potential, that was a reason for Klingon being added, as I understand that upper and lower case letters are treated as separate letters in Klingon.

Not because reading the alphabet is hard (I am actually familiar with Cyrillic from previous studies) but because of how I work in Duo.  Usually when I'm learning, when I encounter a new sentence I solve it, and then I record it in a text file so I can review later.  So, for example, I have text file for each language on Duo, and entries like:    Я не донька я тітка - I am not a daughter I am an aunt  Син і тітка - Son and aunt  Чай - Tea  Моя мати - My mother  Мій тато - My father  Чия це мати - Whose mother is this   So in the majority of the languages in Duo, staying in the English Intl keyboard layout is sufficient.  It covers all my needs, but now I need to switch keyboard layouts, and LEARN the keyboard layout at the same time.  When I encounter something I need to translate into Ukrainian I switch to the Ukrainian keyboard and peck it out in Duo and hit enter.  If it's correct I peck it out into the text file.  Then I switch keyboard layouts and write the English translation.  It's cumbersome, but I think it actually will help me learn the layout in the long run because I have to type each sentence twice, and I don't let myself cheat with copy+paste."

I don't want to be discouraging or anything but since you know the grammatics and vocabulary I would advice you to buy an audiobook or watch some youtube videos from nativespeakers so that you can work on some proper pronounciations.

Intuitively I can't see any reason we'd start acting differently for no longer getting streak rewards except maybe to actually deter people from continuing because maintaining their streak doesn't feel like it matters anymore (I don't think this will happen often, though, since Lingots are useless).

duolingo,37ujff,frenezulino,5,Sat May 30 18:54:42 2015 UTC,You should head over to Memrise.com and sign up for some of the Esperanto vocabulary course.  I've learned over 1600 words there.
duolingo,37ujff,jl45,3,Sun May 31 02:13:14 2015 UTC,"I think Anki (or another similar flashcard app based on spaced repetition) is much better than Memrise, since it doesn't require that you write your answers, you can just think of them - it's muuuch faster (and less likely to worsen RSI). The problem with Anki is that it's not so pretty or gamified as Memrise - but under the hood, it's much more powerful and customizable. It can do anything Memrise does and more. It's also an open source app, and you can export your decks to other apps."
duolingo,37ujff,TotesMessenger,2,Sun May 31 07:58:56 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you've been downvoted.  Anki really is a good alternative to memrise, exept for the social/gamification side (as you pointed out)."

I find that if I don't write them I always misspell them etc, as I can easily recognise a word like ekposedi but it takes me a while to actually be able to write it without an error"
duolingo,37ujff,JohnHadron,1 point,Sun May 31 13:00:51 2015 UTC,"No, you don't have to pick it from a selection. You have to remember it by yourself - but instead of writing it, you just visualize it in your mind, which is exactly what would happen before writing your answer, only much faster because you don't have to physically write it. For instance, you're learning English and you're shown a picture of an apple - you don't have to write ""a"", ""p"", ""p"", ""l"", ""e"". Just think ""apple""! But if you want to, Anki (and a couple similar apps) can actually ask you to write it down, just like Memrise. Anki can do anything Memrise can do, only better. Memrise can be better in certain ways, though: it's definitely cleaner and ""cuter"" (while Anki is certainly more powerful, even if you don't look ""under the hood""); and you can find certain decks there that you can't find in Anki (although the opposite is also true!). Anki can show you anything you want (words, pictures, video, sound, or a combination of any of these) and to reply you can either write the answer down, or think the answer and then be shown it to check if you were right (and again, the answer can be anything you want: words, sound, pictures, video...). Then you just tell the app if you were right (and you can actually tell it how well you remember it). And this can be done in a split second."

duolingo,37s5nr,flootzavut,3,Sat May 30 01:51:55 2015 UTC,"I've studied all the languages I'm doing on Duo previously over the past decade+, so for most of them I'm just using Duo as a refresher/give me a little exposure. The only ones I've never really studied before that I'm doing on Duo are Portuguese (although I read through maybe half a Cortina book back in the day) and Swedish (but it's related to German and Dutch, which I have studied, so that makes it not too much of a stretch.)   If I didn't have all the previous learning under my belt, I wouldn't attempt to do what I'm doing on there (9 languages simultaneously). I started just over 68 days ago and I've been sticking to roughly doing at least one lesson in each language per day (this has been fairly easy to keep up with since until earlier this month I was on the bus for around 30 minutes most days going to/from school, so I just started utilizing that time to do Duo lessons).   I should finish most of them by the end of the year. Once I've finished a few trees, I will assess how I feel about tackling some of the other trees and figure out a plan for how to continue maintaining the languages I'm working on now while adding new ones. I'll probably not do Norwegian and Danish simultaneously, nor will I start either one until I'm at least done with the Swedish tree (I'll probably go through the Assimil book as well and really work on cementing Swedish in my head before moving on to another Scandanavian language).   I'm interested in getting an understanding of Turkish and Irish since I've never studied either of them. I'm also looking forward to learning Romanian (since it's almost like a bridge between Romance and Slavic and it's the last ""major"" Romance language I've never studied) and Polish whenever those courses are released.  Of course, I will start the Russian course as soon as it's released (I have studied it...fairly extensively actually, so...that'll also be more of a refresher).  As for me, I have a bachelor's in Linguistics, I'm working towards an MA right now, and plan to pursue a PhD once I've attained the MA. So all of these languages are really of a professional interest to me in some capacity, because I never know when I might see some feature that might pique my interest enough to look further into it."

Now that it's released, I'll take a break from Swedish to not mix the languages at all! Dutch is my mother tongue, so I just finished that tree to have one finished :). I took Spanish in school until I reached a point of almost fluency so I'm just reviewing the course and see if I can learn new things. Idem dito for French.  The only course I'm doing now which I want to complete because I really want to learn the language is Norwegian. I doubt I'll do Swedish or Danish after it because I don't want to mix the languages."

I also study several languages but I need some time to get used to each language, otherwise I'd mix everything up. And by ""some time"" I mean several weeks to months. I actually wanted to start the Esperanto course today after finishing the Norwegian tree, but my brain is so full of Norwegian that I feel I need to consolidate what I've learned in the last days. But in some weeks I think I'm ready for another language. (Of course I'm doing Esperanto lessons anyway because I'm impatient as hell. My brain already hurts.)"

Once I finish those (along with their corresponding Memrise courses), I plan to keep refreshing myself + tackle another language or two with greater intensity. Right now, Ukrainian is my third language since I'm prepping for the Russian tree (I'm taking a break from Irish for now), but it's more for fun than anything. Language learning comes hard for me and I've gotten frustrated and given up before so right now, I'm not making fluency a huge priority."

duolingo,37phav,Belboz99,13,Fri May 29 12:44:40 2015 UTC,I'm finding it incredibly easy after doing French on duolingo for a few weeks. I've learned more Esperanto in the past 24hours than I have in a month of learning German casually for fun taking breaks from learning French.
duolingo,37phav,44444444444444444445,12,Fri May 29 13:34:16 2015 UTC,"I gave it a whirl, and yeah, it is amazingly easy to learn.  At one point I had a 7 word sentence, all gold, all new words, and I could read it accurately.  I haven't done French, but I've completed my Spanish tree and fooled around with Italian.  I've also gotten pretty far with German as well.  I really like how simple it is without needing verb conjugations, indefinite articles, the phonetics are really good too.  One thing that irks me a bit, maybe I'm being pedantic or something, is the frequency of accented characters on common use words, like She, It, or, etc.  If I had a dedicated keyboard that wouldn't be as big a deal, just makes it a bit more tedious than I feel it could be."
duolingo,37phav,Belboz99,13,Fri May 29 14:16:18 2015 UTC,"Its the unfortunate outcome of learning a language designed before computers in a world that has now come to be dominated by english-language computing. Esperanto needs the extra characters to maintain the 1-to-1 link of phoneme to symbol. Outside of Duolingo, you can type them as sx for ŝ for example, you can even get a programme for your computer that recognises such letter combinations and turns them into esperanto characters automatically.   (ido)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ido_%28language%29] does not have any characters apart from the ones in the English alphabet however it does introduce three digraphs ch, qu and sh, which means it looses perfect 1-1 sound to letter association.  Overall I think I prefer ido to esperanto but esperanto is vastly better established than ido."
duolingo,37phav,skellious,2,Fri May 29 15:02:24 2015 UTC,"Ido (language):       Ido /ˈiːdoʊ/ is a constructed language created to be a universal second language for speakers of diverse backgrounds. Ido was specifically designed to be grammatically, orthographically, and lexicographically regular, and above all easy to learn and use. In this sense, Ido is classified as a constructed international auxiliary language.  Ido was created in 1907 out of a desire to reform perceived flaws in Esperanto, a language that had been created for the same purpose 20 years earlier. The name of the language traces its origin to the Esperanto word ido, meaning ""offspring"",  since the language is a ""descendant"" of Esperanto. After its inception, Ido gained support from some in the Esperanto community, but following the sudden death in 1914 of one of its most influential proponents, Louis Couturat, it declined in popularity. There were two reasons for this: first, the emergence of further schisms arising from competing reform projects; and second, a general lack of awareness of Ido as a candidate for an international language. These obstacles weakened the movement and it was not until the rise of the Internet that it began to regain momentum.  Ido uses the same 26 letters as the English (Latin) alphabet with no diacritics. It draws its vocabulary from French, Italian, Spanish, English, German, and Russian, and is largely intelligible to those who have studied Esperanto.  Several works of literature have been translated into Ido, including The Little Prince and the Gospel of Luke. As of the year 2000, there were approximately 100–200 Ido speakers in the world.

There are programs and keyboard layouts you can download to help with this. Unfortunately, in Windows, there doesn't seem to be a built-in layout that allows you to type all the needed characters. The ""Canadian Multilingual Keyboard"" allows you to use the ""hat"" (circumflex) letters, but doesn't support the Ŭ (u with breve) and the layout has some general weirdness. There needs to be something like the US international keyboard (which unfortunately only supports hats on vowels) that supports those characters so people don't need to download external stuff."

duolingo,37phav,ubermatze,3,Fri May 29 13:32:39 2015 UTC,"Is it really that easy to learn?   It's  extremely  regular.    The  stereotypical  example  is  comparing verb  conjugation in  different languages  -  for  example  the  word  for  ""to  be""   French:  ""être"" -   here's the  table of  conjugations. German:  ""sein"" -  here Spanish:  ""estar"" -  here,  ""ser"" -  here  English:  ""(to)  be"" -   here And  here's  Esperanto:  ""esti""  -   chart at the  bottom  of the  page here   That's  it.  That's  the  whole thing.  And  every  verb  in the  language is  conjugated  exactly like that -  -   ""kanti"" (to  sing)   -  here  -  ""vojaĝi"" (to  travel)  -  here  -  ""skribi"" (to  write)  -  here  Etc etc.  If  you  can  conjugate  any   verb  in  Esperanto, then you  can  conjugate  every  verb  in  Esperanto  -  no  exceptions.   You   do  have  to learn  the  vocabulary  just  like  any  language  -  in  order  to be  able  conjugate the  verb  for  ""to  dance"",  you  have  to  know what the  verb  for  ""to  dance""  is  -  but  that's  easier  than  most languages  also, because  Esperanto  has a very  regular  system  of  prefixes and  suffixes  for  forming  new  words.  E.g.  the  word  ""feliĉa"" means  ""happy"".   malfeliĉa  means  ""unhappy"" feliĉega  means  ""very  happy"" feliĉeta  means ""slightly  happy"". feliĉulo  would mean  ""happy person"" feliĉe  means  ""happily""   -  and  we  can  mix  and match these  too    malfeliĉega:  ""very  unhappy"" malfeliĉeta:  ""slightly  unhappy"" malfeliĉege:  ""very unhappily""    -  Etc etc,  and  again,  exactly the  same  way  for  every  word.   So  for  every  word  of Esperanto vocabulary that you learn,  you can automatically  form  5  or  10  or  20   other words.    This  makes  learning the  vocabulary go a lot  faster  than  in many  languages.   -   https://www.duolingo.com"

No computer-generated voice is ever going to be perfect - at least the Spanish one doesn't yell everything like it does on Google Translate. New, higher-quality voices (if they exist) probably require an expensive license to be bought and it's probably not worth it for a relatively small improvement.

duolingo,37mdpf,Obliviuns,5,Thu May 28 18:05:27 2015 UTC,"TL;DR If you feel comfortable with one language from the family, go for another, but if you don't, IMHO you should probably wait a bit because it will likely be very confusing.  I can't talk about romance languages, since I know none, but I can tell you about my experience learning very closely related languages. My native language is Polish, I've been learning Russian for 5 years, 3 months ago I started learning Belarusian and I recently did the Ukrainian tree on Duolingo.  I'd wanted to learn Belarusian for a long time, but I was afraid that it might interfere with my (then pretty weak) Russian, so I didn't pursue it. And now that I started learning it I feel like I was right – if I had done that a few years ago, the result would be just a confusing mess of both languages. But since I feel comfortable with Russian now and I get regular practice, there is no problem.  However, considering how weak my Belarusian is, doing the Ukrainian tree just confused the hell out of me. :D I don't regret doing it, it has definitely helped me understand Ukrainian and its grammar better, but I think I will wait out a year or so before going any further with Ukrainian because now when I try to speak Belarusian my mind just comes up with random Ukrainian words all the time :D"
duolingo,37mdpf,takegasuki,3,Thu May 28 19:03:39 2015 UTC,"I don't really mix up the Romance languages and I've learned French, Italian, Spanish, and have now started with Portuguese. They all have their own ""flavor"" to me. I think it really all comes with practice, exposure, and time. If you want to learn Italian, learn Italian. It's a fantastic language and you won't regret it. If you want to keep your Spanish, you should probably actually study it and remove your Portuguese from it so that you're actually speaking Spanish and not some hybrid. That way it gets a distinct place in your head and isn't just ""Portuguese with some funny words and pronunciation changes"" for you.   So, you can keep them distinct, but you have to be willing to put the time into it."
duolingo,37mdpf,tendeuchen,2,Thu May 28 19:10:31 2015 UTC,"My opinion may not be one that everyone agrees with. I am a native English speaker with German (eight years), French (twelve years), and Spanish (four years) varying from fluent to proficient in that order. I'm a beginner in other languages from many families, and this has held true: learning a second language was the hardest for me, but that learning a third was second hardest. Everything past that has gotten easier.   My experience was that I had more of a hard time learning German as a third language because French already occupied my ""designated foreign language"" in my mind. I would often drift into French or insert a word accidentally. Once I became proficient enough, that happened less and less. When I began to learn Spanish, I rarely got confused just because I already knew French. It helped more than anything, because I didn't have to learn an entirely brand new set of grammatical and lexical rules.   I think it gets easier the more you practice and use both languages. It also helps to try to understand language in general, something about knowing the broader rules allows me to apply them and keep them separate better with each language. For what it's worth, as a beginner you're going to make mistakes and get confused regardless of the language and its family. If you forget a language entirely, it's because you stop maintaining it. I bet your friends who tried to learn Italian and forgot Spanish weren't practicing both regularly."
duolingo,37mdpf,nippleeee,2,Thu May 28 19:14:31 2015 UTC,I remember at one point when I was intensely studying both Spanish and Irish I would try to say things Verb-Subject-Object in Spanish and then have to correct myself. Thankfully I've gotten past that.

Without fail, I would always get the two mixed up. I'm learning Irish at the minute and I looked at Scottish Gaelic. I don't think I'll learn Scottish Gaelic as it's quite similar to Irish, particuratly the dialect I'm studying now."

I never had any problems differentiating between them. After about a week of study, they just feel different. You pick up on subtle little differences (the 'zz' and other double letters in Italian, where they're rare in Spanish; the double and triple vowels in Dutch that don't happen in German, that sort of thing), and I find my pronunciation changes accordingly.  That said, Esperanto on Duolingo is more difficult than I remember, because I'm coming at it from just having done a month of Spanish and I keep trying to gender-match nouns and adjectives. Sometimes it's the little things that trip you up, but even that you'd probably get over pretty quickly."

It still happens sometimes but I think the most useful technique for me is to insert another (unrelated) language between the two, so you're not doing two similar languages back to back. For example, practice some Turkish between your Spanish and Italian/French, or do one in the morning and one later, so your brain doesn't have to switch gears so quickly."

The funny thing is, is that I always wanted to learn French growing up, but someone got involved with Spanish and German. When I got into college, I decided to pursue my dream of learning French! I've been learning French a shorter amount of time than German and I know more French. I love all three of these languages and I don't regret taking Spanish first since I love the culture and community. I figured, ""why not just do them all?"" Personally, I don't confuse these languages too much, but it does happen. I rarely ever confuse Spanish/French with German and vice versa; however, I do sometimes confuse Spanish and French (mostly the endings of the verbs in their infinitive forms). All in all, with enough practice and dedication, I think you'll be able to master these languages. :)"

If not, try the Italian placement test in the from-Spanish course and try it out. See if you think it helps you.   Literally the worst thing that could happen is you don't like it and decide to continue with the tree in the from-English course.

Surprisingly, there are a lot of Italian words that are unique in themselves (ragazzo, strada, etc.) and that are more similar to French (fromaggio/fromage, piovere/pleurer)  I looked at Italian and there are things that are not found in Spanish (such as clitic nouns, which are in French), so I don't think it's a good idea to compare both languages together. It's a totally different language and more things that set both languages apart. Cognates help, but don't get hung up on them and confuse yourself :)"

duolingo,37pc5v,human_being_01,12,Fri May 29 10:02:01 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit tired to read that. Esperanto is not sexist. It has it's own gender construction rules that you may or may not like. But there is nothing in esperanto implying that women are inferior to men.  If really you don't like how the gender works in esperanto, it's fine, nobody force you to learn it."
duolingo,37pc5v,_throawayplop_,6,Fri May 29 12:44:37 2015 UTC,"This is made to be a bigger issue in esperanto than in other languages with this problem since esperanto was designed whilst the others came about through time. There is a solution, it's called ido, but what you have to understand is esperanto went through a long period of reforms and esperantists got exasperated at having to keep relearning their languages. Much like spelling reforms (such as the 1998 german one), people do not like change in their language. English doesn't traditionally have a gender neutral singular pronoun, but the single-person ""they"" is now in common use in the UK, I've even seen it in government documents.   So if you want to reform esperanto, do what natural language users do and just start using your preferred alteration. But beware that in doing so you are creating dialects, which in time could turn into different languages (like ido or even more diverse) which would somewhat undermine the single auxiliary language idea.   If you want evidence that this happens, look at latin --> all the romance languages or how old English and old German split into two languages from one that was mutually intelligible."

This would create a neutral term but leave the original base word. Also, traditionalists would be more likely to go for it.  Has this idea been brouhht up before?"
duolingo,37pc5v,StillUnbroke,1 point,Fri May 29 16:11:08 2015 UTC,"For the most part, any noun ending in -o tends to be neutral (though was originally masculine). The feminine suffix -in is usually used for family names (patro = father, patrino = mother) or if someone wants to say ""amikino"" to clarify that their friend is a woman or whatnot.  I have read articles like this on specifically changing these family names to be more neutral (""patro"" and ""frato"" are pretty masculine sounding, so it would be hard to use it neutrally). So, instead of ""patro"" for parent, it suggests ""ĝenitoro"" for parent, so you could add -in or -icx to specify gender if you really wanted to."
duolingo,37pc5v,Rejcx,2,Fri May 29 22:16:21 2015 UTC,"One of the things that got me hyped about learning Danish was that the grammatical genders were split into ""common"" and ""neuter"" and have nothing to do with female/male dichotomy.   I stopped learning Arabic for a while because I was a bit put off by how suffixes change based on the gender of who the speaker is addressing.   Esperanto was intended to be a ""politically neutral"" language, so it doesn't surprise me that there's controversy about gender in the language. It does matter, especially when people can just as easily be spending their time learning a much more widespread language."
duolingo,37pc5v,Oldcadillac,3,Fri May 29 17:31:09 2015 UTC,"The only reason Danish is divided into ""common"" and ""neuter"" is because it has lost it's feminine form, the ""common"" form is actually the old masculine form.   The same thing is slowly but surely happening in Norwegian, and given time and usage it will resolve itself for Esperanto aswell.  Languages are a natural process, one can't just go out there and say ""Hey dude, you're not speaking your language properly because from today one has to say this instead of that not to offend anyone""."

You could try books that you read a long time ago so that it doesn't seem boring.   That said I think me favorite Spanish books are from Javier Negrete. ""Salamina"" tells the story of Temistocles (I can't believe I still remember that name), a Greek man who was very important in the defence if Greece against Persia. The book's name come from the battle of Salamina, which a huge Naval battle and the turning point of the book. There are a lot of mayor battles like the battle of marathon and the one depicted in the movie 300 but from the side of the Persians.   Atlantis is a very interesting book where he takes a weird spin on the mythos surrounding Atlantis. It's a book set in the modern era. My memory is foggy so I don't remember of the atlanteans are involved in a world conspiracy or if it was an apocalypse-type thing. I think it was a little bit of both.   No idea if you're going to be able to get these book though. So maybe my whole post wasn't very useful lol. I bought them at a local library years ago."

That is a nice statement, and shows Duolingo's way of repeating excercises until you get a good ""feel"" of what sounds correct, but if you are really committed you will end up looking this kind of ""boring"" grammar information elsewhere.

duolingo,37daqm,krnm,6,Thu May 28 18:11:03 2015 UTC,"I like to say that Duolingo has the best cost-to-benefit ratio of any product I've found.  It has some glaring weaknesses -- the listening and speaking exercises are awful -- but it's free and takes a few minutes per day.    Yes, it'll only give you the basics, but so does every other language program.  The discs may be labeled Levels 1-5 or Beginner-Intermediate-Advanced, but pretty much every packaged program gives you enough to get to a high beginner or low intermediate stage.  That's enough to get around and meet day-to-day needs, and for many people that's where they no longer need hand-holding and can start exploring the language on their own through native media.    The grammar in Duolingo is a weak point.  Some lessons have Notes and Tips attached, but not many.  Most of the grammar learning is done through trial and error.  I don't care for that, but some people do, so try it out and see how it works for you.    Using only Duolingo, you'll be able to do what Duolingo was built to do; translate documents from your target language into English.  To get the most out of it, I'd recommend using Duo in combination with other resources.  Get a textbook to answer your grammar questions, an audio course to work on your speech, books or newspapers for some independent reading, and language partners so you can practice writing and speaking the language in your own words."
duolingo,37daqm,imacoda,5,Tue May 26 22:55:08 2015 UTC,"I can only speak for Danish, as each language is done a little differently and their respective teams will set up the tree based on what they think will be most effective. Some teams might do it great, some might not. At least with Danish, it is pretty good. Duolingo helps a lot with a basic understanding of reading/writing the language. A little of speaking and listening, but not much. You'll need to practice that stuff on your own, mostly. By the time you have finished all of your lessons, which can take a couple months to a couple years, depending on what pace you go at, will not make you fluent. It won't really make you conversational either. You could easily become conversational by the end if you supplement it with other things, though. Duolingo alone is definitely good, but it can't do everything. If you really want to learn a language, duolingo is a great tool to use. Just don't only use duolingo.   What I do to learn Danish, is do duolingo every day. Even if it's just a little bit, spend a couple minutes doing it. I also listen to Danish music. I'll listen to a song a few times and see what I can understand. Then I'll google the lyrics and work on translating those. Then if I've done all I can I'll find translated lyrics online. Generally the only things I can't figure out are sayings or idioms that I haven't heard before. I'll know the meaning of all the words, but translating it literally becomes meaningless. Another thing I do is listen to Danish talk radio. That's a lot harder. There is no transcript to read. No online translations. Everything must be done on the spot, in your head, with no checking. I'm about 60% of the way through the lessons and I can get an idea of what they're talking about, but not much more than that. If I was reading it, I'd be much better with it. I'm not friends with any danes so I can't practice with them. All of my practice is independent and online.   TL;DR: Duolingo is a great tool to learn languages, but duolingo alone is not enough if you really want to learn it."

It'll get you off the ground in reading/writing (and a bit listening, but not as well as the other two) and you'll learn good introductory vocab/grammar. After that, though, it's largely up to the learned to improve themselves; textbooks and other programs can only bring you so far."

But I think if you know a little about a language, and you complete the tree on Duolingo you can definitely talk a little bit of the language. Reading and writing way better than understanding and speaking but I think it'll still help you. It's very worth committing time to. It's free and it's fun to do and you'll get great knowledge about various words in any language that might come in handy one day.  tldr; you learn the basics of a language, so you do learn something and can have basic conversations with native speakers after completing the tree."

duolingo,37eolw,Special_KWonder,7,Wed May 27 02:03:18 2015 UTC,"Okay, so German has 3 genders: Masculine, feminine, and neuter. It also has one plural definite article.  For the 4 main cases (and the only ones I have learned, sorry!) Nominativ, Akkusativ, Dativ, and Genitiv, the articles are:  Masculine: Der (nom) Den (akk) Dem (dat) Des (gen) Indefinite (a/an in English) ein (nom) einen (akk) einem (dat) eines  Feminine: Die (nom) Die (akk) Der (dat) Der (gen) Indefinite: eine (nom/akk) einer (dat/gen)  Neuter: Das (nom/akk) Dem (dat) Des (gen) Indefinite: ein (nom/akk) einem (dat) eines (gen)  Plural: Die (nom/akk) den (dat) der (gen)  Now, here are the cases: Nominativ: the subject of the sentence. In ""Der Junge hat eine Katze,"" the boy is the subject of the sentence.  Akkusativ: the direct object of the sentence. In the example sentence for Nominativ, the cat would be the direct object, as the subject is directly involved with it. (Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, that's just how my teacher explained it.)  Dativ: The Dativ case deals with the indirect object in the sentence. In ""Ich kaufe meinem Lehrer ein Fahrrad,"" my teacher is the indirect object, as my verb is doing something for them, not at them.  Genitiv: this is the possession case. I don't know any correct example sentences, sorry.  This is just a brief overview, and I may be totally wrong, so other Redditers, feel free to correct any mistakes you may find.

duolingo,379hwj,Fobos531,3,Tue May 26 01:31:57 2015 UTC,Can you describe in more detail how it was? Was it hard to learn like that? Did you find anything hard to understand?
duolingo,379hwj,lumisade93,6,Tue May 26 12:30:06 2015 UTC,"I wasn't a complete beginner, which is imo pretty much mandatory when attempting this course, since it obviously does not teach you the Cyrillic alphabet or anything about Russian grammar (actually, it doesn't teach you a lot about German grammar either). I basically started the course in hopes of enhancing my vocabulary since I got a bit bored with memrise. While I certainly picked up a few new words (esp. adverbs, these lessons were really helpful), the biggest improvement I think was becoming more secure conjugating and declining words, since that is needed in almost every sentence. I feel like the course deteriorated towards the end at a rather alarming rate. In the beginning, everything's explained with additional notes, like you'd expect, but in the last fourth or so, when the really difficult concepts of the German language are introduced, I would have expected to at least have something to aid the (Russian) learner. For instance, what good is it to have exercises to showcase the three past tenses of German by always using in the translation the only past tense Russian has, with no additional information? Vice versa I would also say that the end of the course would be really tricky for someone who did not have any prior knowledge of Russian. What probably irked me the most where the German word choices... too often a loan word is unnecessarily used and a perfectly good German word is not accepted as an answer. All in all I would recommend doing the course if you A) have a solid grasp of the basics of Russian and B) want to get more comfortable using the cases. Would not recommend it for learning vocab, stick to memrise in that case, as boring as it may sometimes be. ;)  Btw, I chose the German course mainly to be challenged more regarding alignment, not because it's my first language."

Don't worry if you don't get it. Some natives probably would struggle too.   It goes something like this:   Your own day is short but your family's long. Listen to its roots below. Thousands of years of laughter and crying you'll hear. While it's branches will reach toward eternity   It's much longer, but this is my favorite part.

There's even a chance that we'll be moving to one of the Nordic countries depending on how things go here in the US in the next decade, so learning Danish will help substantially toward understanding Swedish and Norwegian.  Having fun people to chat with helps, too.

Die Deutsche Welle do a podcast called 'Langsam Gesprochene Nachrichten' (Slowly Spoken News) that's very good for getting an ear for the pronunciation and the general flow. You could also go beyond apps to more traditional learning methods. I find the Colloquial series of books to be very accessible and easy to use. Google 'Colloquial German' and have a look at that.

duolingo,3784hb,DibsMusic,13,Mon May 25 17:35:35 2015 UTC,"The first step for me is clearly to start reading a book in the target language once you finish your tree.  I only used Duolingo to learn Swedish and I started reading a book when I was getting towards the end, and although at the beginning it was hard and I had to look up words often to understand things in reasonable detail, I got through it. At the end I wasn't using the dictionary anymore and I still understood all the relevant information. I am now reading the sequel while listening to the audiobook.  I did the same for English after a bit more than a year of high school courses. I understood more and more as I read more books, then at some point I started watching some videos and then some series (without subtitles) to work on my listening and speaking. After countless hours spent watching stupid American series, mostly to avoid studying for finals, I now consider myself fully fluent. :D  Reading is for me the best way to get the feeling of the language and extend your vocabulary once you've got the basics down."

duolingo,3784hb,IAmTheEngineer,8,Mon May 25 22:47:16 2015 UTC,"Fluency (at least to me) isn't so much about how many words you know as how comfortable you feel and sound using the language.   Studying is certainly helpful, but I think the biggest thing is to practice reading, speaking, writing, and listening.    For example, I get my news in Spanish almost every day.  When I look something up in Wikipedia, I start with the Spanish version.  I've also read through several graded readers, and then moved on to kids' and young adult books (Harry Potter is quite popular because it's available in every language and you probably know the key points of the story.)    For writing, I keep a journal on Lang-8 for natives to correct and comment on.  I watch several TV shows on TV and Netflix, as well as some cooking channels on YouTube.  Every now and then (not as often as I should), I'll find somebody on a language exchange service like italki or Hellotalk to have a brief conversation.  I read articles out loud to practice my speaking, and I even talk to my cat in Spanish, narrating my activities as I do them.    There is still a focused learning component; I'll read up on verb tenses or pick 10-20 new words per day to make into flashcards. However, a majority of my time is spent interacting with natives or enjoying their media."

One free, new one is CoffeeStrap (an app actually), one that costs money is Verbling. There are plenty of others.  Read books/listen to music/watch TV and movies in the language you're learning."

You will not have mastered the skills. This will take some months of practice. Continue with duolingo until you have it all mastered with no using hints for anything. I'm not sure how long this will take as I haven't done it yet, though I have been keeping my Spanish tree gold for a couple months.   You should get some books, DVDs, or best of all friends who speak French so that you can expand your vocabulary, and improve your listening and speaking skills.   Duolingo will not bring you to fluency. It will bring you to the edge of being conversational, but duolingo is pretty poor at teaching you to talk or listen, and this is probably what you should start concentrating on. You should be able to read slowly if you keep a translation dictionary handy."

Purely from a conceptual standpoint, the grammar isn't harder than the one of French or English (though difficulties lie in other areas).  The most difficult part are a  set of five suffixes (-e, -(e)n, -(e)r, -(e)s, -(e)m) that show up pretty much everywhere and all mean like a thousand things and your two choices are 1) learning a lot of big tables by heart or 2) hope you develop a feeling for them and manage to get them right intuitively."

Besides various ""intro to German"" tutorials/books over the years, I've probably had a total of 40-50 private lessons (I know that's not much).  For me, German spelling and pronunciation just makes absolute sense. Grammar is another story. It's not for lack of structure; German grammar is very structures; it's just that it's so alien compared to English.  I once decided to try French for a week prior to a trip to Paris and I simply found the pronunciation as alien as German grammar and gave up. I'd much rather tackle German over French."

He has many Swedish friends and they have flawless conversations. However, I think he said written Danish was much easier for him to read than written Swedish, but the speaking is the other way around. For other Norwegians I have no idea what the case is. It's so varied that most people basically have their own dialect.  In Reykjavik, though, where I spent a while of my time, it's completely different. Icelandic is a whole new ball game compared to the three Scandinavian languages and is closer to Old Norse, I think.  I'm learning Norwegian for the time we go to visit his family in Oslo (he has younger siblings who can't speak a lot of English yet) and the tree is great so far - and with the amount of Swedish people I now have on my Facebook, I'm even beginning to understand some of the words just because of my Norwegian knowledge.

However, swedes understand me and my coworkers better when we speak, while Danes have more problems--but lots of their words (I.e. information, waffle, computer) are English. I can read both equally well, that is.@, OK for things where I have context, like subtitles. For reference, my Norwegian passive vocab is quite high, my active not so much."
duolingo,3752vj,nordicul,3,Mon May 25 07:40:28 2015 UTC,"Norwegian is right in the middle. They have little problems speaking with Swedes and much less problems than Swedes when speaking with Danes. In a conversation between a Dane, a Swede and a Norwegian, they could all speak to each other in their own languages but the Norwegian sometimes needs to just repeat what the Swede / Dane said to make it easier for the Dane / Swede. Norwegian is a bit easier for Danes than Swedish so the Norwegian just repeating what the Swede says helps.  Iceland is not in Scandinavia and much more conservative. No Scandinavian language will help much. At least not more than German would."

duolingo,36w6sr,vytah,5,Fri May 22 18:41:10 2015 UTC,Doesn't Ukrainian have a special ending for the diminutive (like most IE languages)? Why should auntie be accepted?
duolingo,36w6sr,tuosobebecerveza,9,Fri May 22 19:44:46 2015 UTC,In a discussion about the word titka a moderator/Ukrainian native speaker said that titka is not a diminutive but just the regular word for aunt. I think auntie shouldn't be accepted.
duolingo,36w6sr,spiderjuice,3,Fri May 22 20:47:47 2015 UTC,"As I said in response to u/tuosobebecerveza, the hint for ""titka"" said ""aunt/antie"" - so I was just going by what it said and offered another spelling.  Although it's worth mentioning that I've heard people from the UK exclusively use ""auntie,"" so they might be interchangeable in some English-speaking countries."
duolingo,36w6sr,galleon484,7,Fri May 22 22:42:54 2015 UTC,"I would say that, in British English, aunty/auntie are seen as equivalent to aunt and don't carry the same diminutive implication which words like mommy and daddy have. So on that basis i think duo should accept them all.  However, i can't really speak for all British people and there are probably regional differences. (there always are)"

duolingo,36w6sr,agitatedandroid,3,Fri May 22 22:35:44 2015 UTC,"Has anybody ever gotten a notification that their suggestion had been rejected?

duolingo,36w6sr,vitoreiji,5,Fri May 22 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"I would have to imagine that perhaps they don't have the resources to respond to every poor suggestion. That would seem to be more of a ""you need a one on one teacher"" sort of problem rather than what duolingo is currently capable of."
duolingo,36w6sr,douette,5,Fri May 22 23:47:28 2015 UTC,"Hmm, it's hard to know without looking at any hard data, but it never occurred to me that wrong sentences would outnumber correct ones by a large margin, since, in principle, the person filing the suggestion is already pretty sure their answer is correct (keep in mind we're talking about ""my answer should have been accepted"" reports).  I was thinking in a system were the volunteer would determine the answer is wrong, write up an explanation (or point to an existing one) and save it. Then the reporter would get a notification with said explanation and could seek further clarification in the forums, if necessary. And, most importantly, from then on anyone who tries to submit the same wrong answer would immediately see the explanation. I'd imagine in the long run there would be a lighter load of wrong submissions, and immediately less frustration for the students."
duolingo,36w6sr,vitoreiji,3,Sat May 23 00:02:14 2015 UTC,"Duolingo has this system in place in the Incubator. Each language gets thousands of reports to sort through, and they show up with numbers next to them. If a mistake is particularly common, the contributor can write an explanation to why it is wrong and reject all future reports that match that exact suggestion. The people who reported it won't receive a message, but the learner will then see a black pop-up with that message if they type that exact phrase in the future."

Or, hell, I’d love there to be !Xóõ, but I doubt we’ll get to see that :P  However, the languages I’m hoping for are Icelandic and Romansh (any version but the standard, which no one speaks or uses in any context but legal paperwork and schools)"
duolingo,36uyu7,BoneHead777,7,Fri May 22 15:18:00 2015 UTC,Swahili would be a great choice. Practically a lingua franca in eastern Africa.
duolingo,36uyu7,oricthedamned,4,Fri May 22 17:03:56 2015 UTC,"The one good thing about Afrikaans is that it would be an 'African' language, but would likely fit neatly into preexisting tree format and be easier to bring to completion once they had the necessary contributors.

duolingo,36uyu7,EstherHarshom,14,Fri May 22 12:08:32 2015 UTC,"The only major languages so far covered are European, there's definitely a big demand for Eastern languages as well. I haven't seen any demand, but there are no native African languages either.   It would definitely be cool to support historical languages, but I don't see how that would fit with duolingo's business model. I'm also not sure what classical languages could be done beyond Latin; the issues that prevent Chinese/Arabic and other non-latin script courses would apply just the same to their historical cousins, plus additional difficulties with writing."

duolingo,36uyu7,Ifkl,5,Fri May 22 20:59:14 2015 UTC,"Classical Greek? Old English? We're getting Modern Greek soon, so that shouldn't be too much of an issue as far as input is concerned, and Old English is relatively straightforward. Besides, Esperanto and Klingon don't really fit with Duolingo's business model either. They're a loss-leader, designed to bring people in. They don't cost Duolingo all that much to do, and they get people involved in the system and make loyal users for the courses that do turn more of a profit.  I do agree with you about the Eurocentrism, though. I think Swahili will probably be put into the incubator before too long, and Xhosa after that, not to mention some Native American languages (for example, I can see Ojibwe becoming the first)."

Old English I hadn't thought of, that could be interesting but I'm not sure what most people in the west would want to use it for; I'm thinking more of historical languages with rich and still-read literatures; Latin, Sanskrit, Chinese, Arabic. These are also more practical given their lasting impact on currently used languages; I'm actually not sure, does Greek have any major descendants other than its modern form?"
duolingo,36uyu7,Ifkl,3,Fri May 22 21:04:01 2015 UTC,"Old English is very much important as far as English literature is concerned; I'm pretty sure that the University of York requires undergraduates on their English Literature course to take an Old English language course in their first year, and I doubt it's the only one. The corpus isn't as big as it is for, say, Latin, but with Beowulf and several other poets it's not to be sniffed at -- not to mention the fact that it leads to Middle English, with Chaucer and Pearl Poet and such. It might not be the first on the list, but being basically a Latin script it might speed things along (in the same way we got Klingon -- the definition of a niche language -- before we got Arabic or Mandarin)."

duolingo,36wgyw,MortifiedPuppy,11,Fri May 22 18:13:24 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, knowing a language well helps with a related one, but knowing just a bit of it confuses.  I'm a little bit pissed off that I started Danish the week before Norwegian was added to the incubator. I'm halfway into the Danish tree, and my Danish is not so good that I could just switch to Norwegian and go ""oh yeah, this is like Danish but with one letter switched"". I can't count on myself to always remember which is Danish and which is Norwegian, the Danish I learned is still too fuzzy for that.  On the other hand, learning Dutch on top of my fluent German has been a breeze through, because I never mixed up in my head which is Dutch and which is German.  I'd say you should start with Ukrainian if the following are true:  1) Duolingo is absolutely the only way for you to stick to learning a language, you wouldn't make progress reading a Russian grammar book, listening to Russian Pimsleur or learning Russian words on Memrise.  2) You are good at retaining information perfectly, like you trust yourself you will definitely remember which case endings Ukrainian uses when you move on to Russian declination (which is similar, but not quite)  3) You are only interested in reading and understanding, not so much in actually using the language and doing it in a correct, non-cringeworthy way."
duolingo,36wgyw,Alsterwasser,5,Sat May 23 00:47:48 2015 UTC,"Eh, to be completely honest, the level you'd get to in Ukrainian by the time the Russian course comes out would probably just confuse you more because they're similar instead of helping you.

duolingo,36wgyw,saleope,6,Sat May 23 19:37:35 2015 UTC,"Not really. Although Russian&Ukranian are both Slavic languages, they have different vocab and conjugation of verbs, mb something else. If you want to get a head start, you should learn some Russian words, though the Ukrainian ones would be helpful, such as кiт or кiшка (кот, кошка in Russian), where UKR letter ""i"" turns into RU/UKR letter ""o"". (I say that as native Russian speaker). As for us russians, we cannot sometimes understand Ukrainian speech if it is fast and fluent, because there are a lot of words borrowed by Ukranian from European languages, such as колiрь (""kolir"", color, цвет) in contrast of our language."
duolingo,36wgyw,arhipovnd,5,Fri May 22 19:23:41 2015 UTC,"If your target language is Russian, learn russian. Because it is one of the most important languages, there are plenty of good ressources for Russian. Read the FAQ of r/languagelearning: http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/wiki/index . Yes duolingo is great to stay motivated, but it is not the only free way to learn languages. Apart from the motivation thing, I consider duolingo pretty average.  There are some similarities between russian and ukrainian, so learning ukrainian would give you a small head start to learn russian. It is like you want to learn english, but the hot teacher you have a crush on only teaches french this year. And you don't really know the teachers who teach english. So you decide to learn french first.  Personally, I want to learn a bit of hungarian before going there this summer. If the hungarian course was in beta, I would have taken it. It isn't so I spent 20€ on an assimil book. Because I have a precise goal, I have no problem staying motivated. And apart from that, assimil is a bit better than Duolingo on grammar explanations (at least for the courses I have taken so far on duolingo). I use mnemosyne to help me learn the vocabulary. In a month, I plan to begin reading some simple texts, writing some texts and having them corrected on italki, and chat with some hungarian... So yeah, plenty of ressources outside of duolingo even when the target language is a small language that nobody wants to learn."

duolingo,36s1at,JumpyPorcupine,5,Fri May 22 20:31:19 2015 UTC,I just may have cheated by having this as my native language :) Looking forward to submitting tons of reports!
duolingo,36s1at,frankdtank,2,Fri May 22 13:46:08 2015 UTC,Awesome - congrats!!! Question for you - is there a lot of difference between Bokmal and Nynorsk? I can tell already that some things are pronounced differently then they look.
duolingo,36s1at,kayrynjoy,7,Fri May 22 19:13:56 2015 UTC,Bokmål: Disse to setningene skriver jeg for å vise forskjellen mellom bokmål og nynorsk.

(ja = Я, ju = ю, etc.) Also with your second screenshot, Г makes a ""h"" sound in Ukrainian, so С+Г = Ш, at least in this case. May not be true for all words, depends on case-by-case spelling. Just to keep in mind."
duolingo,36s2wl,MIAbro,2,Fri May 22 01:42:24 2015 UTC,"Haha omg that second screenshot. I like how ""косгтуiе"" is where it draws the line, like the rest of the sentence is perfectly fine.

duolingo,36s2wl,noreasterner,3,Thu May 21 22:47:31 2015 UTC,Я теж. (Me too!)
duolingo,36s2wl,Najlepsiejszy,3,Thu May 21 23:09:19 2015 UTC,I strongly recommend doing this course if you want to learn Russian later on. You'll thank me later
duolingo,36s2wl,noreasterner,9,Thu May 21 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"As a Russian learner of 2 years living in Russia, my humble opinion is that you are wrong and that learners would be better served doing the English for Russian Speakers tree instead. It's there and ready to go, why waste time learning Ukrainian words/spelling/grammar?"
duolingo,36s2wl,Najlepsiejszy,3,Fri May 22 11:18:49 2015 UTC,"As a Pole who has learned Russian for 3 years, LOL. Ukrainian grammar is just like Russian grammar except for some teensy little differences, and is also similar to Polish grammar, except for some teensy little differences. The mutuality goes both ways in each case.   I'll give you that I feel like Ukrainian has been influenced by Polish more, but still, what's the difference between магазин, машина, точка etc etc etc?"

duolingo,36u4wk,Nsena0,12,Fri May 22 03:28:24 2015 UTC,We definitely need a sticky for this question
duolingo,36u4wk,KOTOR_III_CONFIRMED,2,Fri May 22 06:58:20 2015 UTC,Either that or a wiki. Or a link to the unifficial wiki.
duolingo,36u4wk,BastouXII,7,Sat May 23 22:17:05 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. I'm half way through the spanish skill tree and I was able to read the first chapter of the first harry potter book just fine.

I ran into words I didn't know but due to the roots of the word, context, and my familiarity with the material, I was able to read it. Still, I think that is a good accomplishment for half a skill tree on dulingo. I do think that the duolingo is perfect for teaching reading comprehension in the target language and you will get by after duonlingo with a spanish dictionary, either spanish spanish or spanish english. YMMV."
duolingo,36u4wk,mandaday,3,Fri May 22 05:32:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I will definitely need a dictionary or translator to help but besides that I will be able to do it? And reading it will also help learn the language, right?"

duolingo,36u4wk,JCTenton,2,Fri May 22 06:14:28 2015 UTC,"You will definitely definitely need a dictionary, and it will be very frustrating to keep having to go back to it.  However if you can master all the verb forms you should be able to read and understand what is going on."
duolingo,36u4wk,maizecolon,5,Sat May 23 16:35:03 2015 UTC,Duolingo and a comprehensive Memrise course will get you reading to a decent level. Making your own Memrise course for new words you happen across is also effective.

duolingo,36u4wk,galaxyrocker,3,Fri May 22 09:34:03 2015 UTC,"If you're familiar with the Common European Framework for Languages and their ranking system, I would say it gets you to about an A2 level (there's A1-C2, A1 being the most beginner level and C2 being the most advanced level).   I use DuoLingo to work on my German and Italian. I studied both those languages for two years at university. I have found DuoLingo very helpful for refreshing the languages and learning some new vocab, but in all honesty, there's no comparison with classroom learning or immersion. I imagine the people who can read a YA novel in the language after completing DuoLingo are particularly assiduous and/or have been complementing their DuoLingo activities with other language-learning resources."
duolingo,36u4wk,Adajeanne,5,Fri May 22 15:01:57 2015 UTC,"I would add a caveat that it only gets you to a solid A2 in one skill: reading. I'd argue that writing is between A1/A2 just because you're not asked with writing longer coherent structures (paragraphs, basically). And speaking/listening will only be at A1 with Duolingo."

duolingo,36u5b9,KOTOR_III_CONFIRMED,2,Fri May 22 07:00:34 2015 UTC,Ah ok. Just wondering why they don't make it available for all languages for users to at least be able to upload articles etc anyway. Surely that would shore up the numbers of people using Immersion until companies paid?
duolingo,36u5b9,KOTOR_III_CONFIRMED,3,Fri May 22 10:10:27 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Could be to ensure quality articles to translate, consistency of content?  On the business side, realise also that Duolingo makes (some/all?) its money from the contracts it has doing massive translation projects for clients. Depending how valuable this is to their business (they don't do ads or charge for app use), it's completely possible that immersion is the most important feature of Duolingo from a business standpoint, thus they have every interest to keep it as profitable as possible...  Hmm, that was a bit of a rant. Again, those are my thoughts from the articles I've read about Duo's business model."
duolingo,36u5b9,benjaib,1 point,Fri May 22 10:16:45 2015 UTC,"No stress, appreciate the insight as I don't know anything about their business model.

duolingo,36qktp,AssistingJarl,5,Thu May 21 18:53:18 2015 UTC,"Either that, or the ""h-system"" where you use ""ch"" in place of ""ĉ"", and so on. I do hope they'll warn the user not to get in the habit of using the unmarked characters, given how important the diacritics are to Esperanto's phoneticality."
duolingo,36qktp,neotecha,3,Thu May 21 20:27:16 2015 UTC,"I actually just asked this on the facebook group, and unfortunately, it seems that they won't. They cited that it's because of a limitation in Duolingo's interface, basically that it would show up as two separate words, and that they'd basically have to go through and do another pass to add in all the duplicate words."
duolingo,36qktp,vytah,8,Thu May 21 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"Well, Duolingo could add support for it on their side, but I think that in the age of Unicode, it's better to know how to type the actual correct spelling."

duolingo,36sotu,patrrrrrick,8,Thu May 21 20:25:14 2015 UTC,Ukrainian isn't very similar to Russian so it probably wouldn't help too much. I think it's actually more similar to Polish and Belarussian than Russian.
duolingo,36sotu,SrbijaJeRusija,3,Fri May 22 03:11:42 2015 UTC,"Ukrainian isn't very similar to Russian so it probably wouldn't help too much.   The spoken Ukrainian in Lvov, no (and especially the spoken in Karpatiya is not understood even by people from under Kiev.)  Literary Ukrainian, is REALLY similar. Vocabulary is like uncommon in Russian is common in Ukrainian and uncommon in Ukrainian is common in Russian. Gets easier if you are from the south like me, where a large portion of our 'folk' vocab is the 'Ukrainian' word. If you are not a native speaker, then yes, they are dissimilar, as a native speaker, they really are."
duolingo,36sotu,OlDer,2,Fri May 22 04:06:53 2015 UTC,The spoken Ukrainian in Lviv is perfectly understood even by people from eastern Ukraine (granted those people understand Ukrainian at all). There are some special local words and pronunciation is different but the difference is not that dramatic.

duolingo,36sotu,OlDer,1 point,Fri May 22 16:17:33 2015 UTC,Most of Russians don't understand even Ukrainian spoken in eastern Ukraine. It takes some time with exposure to spoken Ukrainian so they begin understand it.

duolingo,36sotu,patrrrrrick,1 point,Sun May 24 00:12:49 2015 UTC,Do you know what kind of Ukrainian is taught in the Duolingo course?
duolingo,36sotu,ZanderyS,12,Fri May 22 13:31:38 2015 UTC,"No. Not at all. Don't learn a language because you think it'll help you learn the one you want, learn what you want first."
duolingo,36sotu,EdwardRec,3,Thu May 21 20:47:09 2015 UTC,"Native Russian speaker here. It would likely help you understand it, but definitely not speak it. For the record, pretty much every Ukrainian AFAIK speaks both Russian and Ukrainian, so they don't really have to adapt. I can't speak Ukrainian myself (yet), but I can understand pretty much all of it.  On the other hand though, I think it might help with Belorussian, yeah."
duolingo,36sotu,SrbijaJeRusija,2,Thu May 21 22:47:55 2015 UTC,"On the other hand though, I think it might help with Belorussian, yeah.   Except virtually no-one even in Belarus even speaks it."
duolingo,36sotu,ilikeyou345,2,Fri May 22 03:59:26 2015 UTC,"If you have an interest in Ukrainian as well, then you should definitely go ahead and start learning it. It will help you wit Russian later on. However, if you don't have any interest in it, then it's not worth it."
duolingo,36sotu,flootzavut,2,Fri May 22 00:58:34 2015 UTC,"Russian (non native) speaker working my way down the Ukrainian tree: to be honest, I think it's just similar enough to be really confusing if you're a beginner. I kind of wish it was a Russian > Ukrainian tree so I could compare the two languages. For me it's fun, but I am not convinced it would be much of a head start on Russian unless you're really good at compartmentalising two closely related languages.  If you're interested in Ukrainian too, then yes. If you're only interested in Russian and your only interest in UK is to give you a head start on RU, then I couldn't recommend it."
duolingo,36sotu,maizecolon,1 point,Fri May 22 22:37:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend doing the WHOLE course if you have no interest in Ukrainian, but I'm also of the opinion that there's no such thing as bad knowledge. If you're asking then you're probably a little interested, so why not play around a bit? Ukrainian isn't exactly the same as Russian but there's enough similarities that it would probably help. If nothing else, it's definitely worth learning the alphabet"
duolingo,36sotu,sarat023,1 point,Fri May 22 02:05:52 2015 UTC,"If you're waiting for the Russian course sign up for the ""English for Russian Speakers"" course instead.  I didn't expect it to be useful but it works really well as a replacement."

duolingo,36sr5t,TheManWith3Buttocks,14,Thu May 21 20:42:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly I find I learn more and complete things faster with the strength bar vs the hearts. Hearts I would peak and ""cheat"" (not actually cheat but I call it that) if I had non left just so I wouldn't have to start from 0 all over again. With the strength bar if I am struggling with a particular phrase or word I can just keep doing it a couple of times without having to restart everything else I'm already practiced enough with.   So maybe with the hearts I got better at the stuff I was good at, because I was force to practice it more if I screwed other stuff up. But I find I get more meaningful repetitions in with the strength bar so it helps me more."

duolingo,36joav,southernsinger,24,Tue May 19 21:47:56 2015 UTC,"No.  Duo is like anything else in language-learning: a tool.  It will only get you so far but you have to do more in order to reach fluency.  That being said, it's a really good tool."
duolingo,36joav,MauriceReeves,38,Tue May 19 22:13:09 2015 UTC,The only way someone would become close to fluent with Duolingo is if they had previous experience with the target language and/or they supplemented it heavily.  Duo doesn't really teach you how to speak.
duolingo,36joav,Marescal14,8,Tue May 19 21:52:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've taken proper Spanish classes and talked with native speakers but haven't really done anything Spanish related in a few years.

duolingo,36joav,invaderpixel,5,Wed May 20 01:08:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think it is a great supplement, and not to sound like an old school grammarian or anything but it needs to actually teach grammar more than anything.

duolingo,36joav,theredmilitiaman,7,Tue May 19 22:00:50 2015 UTC,"Duo's a great introduction. Today I started some free mooc in a language I started studying on duo. I can get the gist of most sentences, but Duo is absolutely not A1-C2 in itself."
duolingo,36joav,astoundingchair,3,Wed May 20 02:03:34 2015 UTC,To which level would you say Duo can bring you?  Something like A2 or B1?
duolingo,36joav,collectionOfTruth,4,Wed May 20 16:52:13 2015 UTC,"Somewhere around there on reading, a little less on writing, and a lot less on speaking. French is also easier than most since so much of the advanced vocabulary has leaked into english. I had the entire french tree gold before I started working on purely french materials like reading wikipedia or novels in the target language."
duolingo,36joav,astoundingchair,5,Wed May 20 18:04:54 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say, but to take a stab at it, I'd say A2 reading and A1 at everything else.  Almost nobody uses Duolingo exclusively, but the closest analogue I can think of was a guy who tore through the German tree in two weeks and then went to Germany.  He said that he could read most of the signs and other material around him, but his listening comprehension was weak and he couldn't speak at all.  Between his placement tests and his initial experience with an A2 class, I'd say his overall skill was in the early part of the A2 range.    B1 is higher than I think people realize.  Consider these descriptions of each level.  B1 means you can deal with most reasonably foreseeable events that might happen when you're abroad; some of the sample exam questions I've seen involve writing 100 words on the subject of renting an apartment, planning a party, or describing an object you own and why it is important to you.  I don't think Duo alone would get a person up to that point."
duolingo,36joav,krnm,2,Thu May 21 04:09:55 2015 UTC,"There's no one tool out there that'll take somebody from zero to fluid spontaneous meaningful conversation.  Duolingo, like most beginner programs, can help you get to a point where you roughly understand what's going on around you and can compose basic sentences.  From there, you'll need to put in lots and lots of time reading, writing, listening, and speaking."

It is worth mentioning that i am very well versed in language learning. I feel like it is ""my thing"""

duolingo,36joav,SilverCookies,7,Wed May 20 19:20:55 2015 UTC,"No offence, but I'm questioning your understanding of a C1 level. At C1 you should be comfortable writing academic essays at a fourth-year undergraduate level in an exam setting with no aids. These are usually 5-10 page essays in the span of two hours on a topic you haven't seen before. At C2 level, you are able to pursue a master's in that language and be publishing academic writing in a journal. This is different from being able to read a book or hold a conversation, you are coming up with technical and professional work with few to no errors. Duolingo doesn't even teach you that level of vocabulary and grammar in Spanish (I have finished the tree). I also took two semesters of Spanish beforehand. I can safely tell you that Duolingo does not even cover two semesters of introductory Spanish, which will leave you at an A2 - able to understand most convos in TV shows and everyday conversations.   If you can write a 5 page essay with no aides in a two hour time span, off a novel/textbook/technical work in professional or technical language, and then defend it for 20 minutes using said vocabulary then you are at a C1. Otherwise, stop fooling yourself and others on this site because it's bullshit. A four year degree would be lucky to leave you at a B2 or C1 - hell most native speakers who do not complete high school aren't even at a C1 level in their own language.   Guys, please look up what these levels are or get yourself assessed. You're not B2/C anything off duo and saying so diminishes the effort people that are actually at those levels put in. For fucks sake."
duolingo,36joav,tellmeyoursowon,0,Fri May 22 04:21:12 2015 UTC,"I never said that Duo will make you fluent in any language nor that it replaces other form of learning. Simply put someone asked a question and i answered, plese do not load it! All i said is that i am well versed in language learning and that after using duo extensively i have become fluent in spanish. That's it. Now i am learning German on Duo, i am about to finish and probably won't be very satisfied with my fluency. Languages are different and in my experience German is way harder than Spanish. Also, I am very familiar with the ABC grading. C1 means ""Can understand a wide range of demanding, longer texts, and recognise implicit meaning. Can express him/herself fluently and spontaneously without much obvious searching for expressions. Can use language flexibly and effectively for social, academic and professional purposes. Can produce clear, well-structured, detailed text on complex subjects, showing controlled use of organisational patterns, connectors and cohesive devices."" and i can. i didn't say everyone can, nor that i will be able to repeat that in the future nor that finishing Duo will automatically make you C1. someone asked something and i answered. period. feel free not to trust me but please don't accuse me of being a liar because you can't possibl know that."

Some days a massive bunch of branches will be ungolded and u just don't have the inclination to review stuff I know (and Duo should know) that I know by now. I think it's a great tool to run through when you first start learning a language and then I think it should be left behind in favour of more productive pursuits.
duolingo,36e7ak,FUCK_YOU_HEISENBERG,9,Tue May 19 11:07:18 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more. Duo would be better off repeating phrases we got wrong (in a memrise-like way) since the meaning of a word varies depending on its usage.

The strengthen skills function is apparently unable to pick up words that actually need strengthening and the whole system with the individually decaying skills basically guarantees that you always have words that you ideally should have repeated already, but you just don't see it because the skill they are in is still gold. When you refresh a skill once it has visibly decayed, you invariably also repeat a lot of stuff you know quite well already, which is a waste of time.  I have resorted to using Anki for ""real"" vocabulary learning, Duolingo is still nice for practicing sentences, but I have accepted that it is not nearly as smart as it could be about presenting you with the right content based upon your learning advances."
duolingo,36e7ak,IAmTheEngineer,2,Mon May 18 20:33:42 2015 UTC,Anki is a great tool but it would benefit from Duo's UI and incentive methods. What we need is a beautiful hybrid of all the free tools haha

It uses sentences, pictures, audio, and sometimes typing to make learning a more engaging process, much like the core Duolingo program.  The Duolingo flashcards, though, they're as basic as flashcards get: ""excellent"" flip ""(they) excel""."
duolingo,36fyby,krnm,1 point,Wed May 20 23:55:35 2015 UTC,"I find the use of custom made Anki cards more helpful for review than Duo. The strength of Duo is to practice comprehension by their algorithmic way to generate new sentences. What Duo largely lacks, and where flashcards can be made to shine, is incorporating vocabulary with notes on syntax and grammar. For instance, French has a lot of prepositional phrases, and Duo does test them, but doesn't give explicit notes about what they mean or where they are appropriate. The info might be there under the discussion for a particular sentence, but it's not readily accessible and causes the content to remain somewhat obscured. The learner is left with an intuitive, but only partial, understanding of the part of speech and its use. On the other hand, with one flash card, I can make a face with the pattern, a face with examples, and a face with notes or use cases. If I want, I can even make multiple cards where one phrase may have several meanings depending on the context. For that matter, even a traditional notion of a flash card to learn nouns (each side with a different language) is able to be found faster with an app like Anki, or a dictionary, than using Duo.   Added benefits of custom decks include expending the vocab introduced by Duo for specific themes (e.g., family, time, numbers). Equally nice, Anki cards can be tagged for exactly this purpose, to make grouping related content together. Duo offers the advantage of presenting a metered and guided set of knowledge to build up basic language skills, which flashcards alone cannot offer.   Neither Duo nor flashcards alone are superior to the other. However, when combined together, the combination can be very complementary."
duolingo,36fyby,leonardicus,2,Wed May 20 22:48:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe I misinterpreted the question.  I like flashcards, but I find the Duolingo flashcard module to be way too simple.  It's just one word out of context and one translation.    I love my Anki custom decks.  The process of creating a card can be time-consuming, but very helpful.  What I do is:     Pick a word Make one or more sentences using that word Find a picture to accompany that sentence, and possibly  Get the nice people on Rhinospike to provide a voice recording of that sentence.   By the time I've done all that, I hardly need to review the cards because I've seen, heard, and used the key word several times.    With a little ingenuity, you can also make cards for things Duo doesn't do well like pronunciation, prompt-response exchanges, trivia, or for more advanced students, L2 words with L2 definitions."

Unless you just pronounce it completely different from anything I've heard. But yeah, maybe it's a question of regional differences in regard to how it's pronounced?  But anyway, it's definitely not to sound superior, I realize it might have come of that way. I just thought I would try to help. I think it's really awesome that people are interested in learning Danish!"

I don't speak Italian but I know some Spanish and recognized the structure. ""Ho"" is the first person conjugation of avere, which is the helping verb ""I HAVE drunk...""  Edit: formatting. If anyone knows Italian really well, please weigh in and confirm or correct me.   Edit 2: latte apparently means milk in Italian. I was just thinking of the espresso drink."

duolingo,3695at,BlkHawk6,2,Sun May 17 21:58:50 2015 UTC,"The difference is more like US English vs UK English.

The same can be said of English within the US, or, if the US is too big for you, German spoken within Germany.  This obsession with specific dialects is ridiculous for a beginner's course like Duolingo which falls way short of making you an autonomous speaker of any of its languages.

duolingo,3695at,Redditor042,7,Sun May 17 11:33:11 2015 UTC,"Minor clarification: ceceo refers to pronouncing both ""ce"" and ""se"" as ""th"" (as in ""think""). That's rare even in Spain.

duolingo,3695at,heimaey,1 point,Mon May 18 18:04:28 2015 UTC,"Phonological history of Spanish coronal fricatives:       In Spanish dialectology, the terms distinción, seseo and ceceo are used to describe the opposition between dialects that distinguish the phonemes /θ/ and /s/, and those that exhibit merger of the two sounds (neutralización) into either /s/ (seseo) or [s̄], a sibilant fricative similar to /θ/ (ceceo).  Dialects that distinguish the two sounds, and thus pronounce the words casa ""house"" and caza ""hunt"" differently, are described as having distinción, whereas the dialects that lack this distinction and pronounce the two words as homophones are described as having seseo if both words are pronounced with [s] or ceceo if both words are pronounced with [s̄].  Seseo is typical of the Latin American and Canarian dialects and some dialects of central Andalusia, whereas distinción is typical of most dialects in Spain, except in much of Andalusia and the Canary Islands. Ceceo is found in some dialects of Spain, in the southernmost part of Andalusia.

duolingo,3695at,BendyBobcat,2,Mon May 18 18:04:55 2015 UTC,"It's very Americanised, so no. For example, they use seseo, words like grama and computador, and they don't use leismo (they say ""Lo conoce"" rather than ""le conoce"" for ""He/she knows him"")."
duolingo,3695at,zjaffee,1 point,Tue May 19 18:07:28 2015 UTC,Castilian is the dialect that was brought to the New World - so they are the same - with minor regional differences (like British English and American English).  Edit. I love how this is getting downvoted. The truth hurts!!!

Good news: We have trimmed away all excess skills we have deemed unfit for the current tree and finalized our ideas for what the beta version will actually include: herring and lightsabers, feathers and Thor, among other words :)  Neutral news: The arduous process of checking and double-checking (specifically-Norwegian) sentences continues with little sign of slowing down. Keep in mind, of course, that this is all for the benefit of the students of the language. With Ukrainian about to be released (certainly before Norwegian), hopefully many of you can begin learning that language in the meantime.
