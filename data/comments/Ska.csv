Ska,3dtz7n,Captain_Ludd,2,Sun Jul 19 13:15:02 2015 UTC,"Love this tune. I was in high school when second wave ska was happening and The Selecter's first album ""Too Much Pressure"" was one of my favorites - up there with The Special's first album. But, like The Special's, they came out of the gate strong (wildly creative and energetic) and faltered. Later releases and iterations of the band played more like cringe-worthy ""tribute"" material which, unfortunately, is what you encounter most often. It seem's as though ""Too Much Pressure"" is out of print and/or somehow tied-up legally. It is not available on streaming services and great songs like ""Everyday"" are only available as less-inspired live versions. Thankfully much of the material shows up on compilations but I still miss the original album experience and the missing tunes are all good. Bad Manners is another example of this - their first album is by far their most listenable (if over-the-top-silly) but seems lost to history leaving only their later poorly produced crap for modern listeners."
Ska,3dtz7n,Jackytar,2,Sun Jul 19 18:00:09 2015 UTC,"the thing about 2tone was that it was ran by musicians, and not businessmen. it created great music, but it was never a great business.   in one way, its a shame, because they never lasted, and then ska was only picked up by american artists and made in their style. not that i'm against it, but as an Englishman, i can't really identify that well with a good majority of american ska, it doesn't appeal to me, it doesn't say anything about my life. 3rd wave bands that retained the old jamaican/british style appeal to me still though.  in another way of looking at it, the lack of suits and businessmen created a genre which wasn't ran by the suits, but by the people. which is one of the things which i believe made 2tone what it was, and still is. its music by the people, for the people. not music by a company for profit, and i believe had 2tone not the freedom it had, it wouldn't have been the same  i'm going to be posting regularly 1st and 2nd wave ska on here, try to up our numbers"
Ska,3dtz7n,Jackytar,2,Sun Jul 19 22:18:39 2015 UTC,Good points about the history of 2tone. I guess I shouldn't complain about the music streaming services. I use Google Play and have discovered a motherlode of new (to me) ska from around the world. Just posted a Thai ska band as an example. I like all ska to include many modern bands but having cut my teeth on 2tone my definition of ska is somewhat more narrow than is generally accepted in this subreddit.

Ska,3ddwmu,skankersores,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:04:19 2015 UTC,About an hour from Boston!
Ska,3ddwmu,skankersores,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:08:30 2015 UTC,"And I'm another hour the past Boston at least. I can usually rush into the city from NH after work and make it to shows. That being said, love what you guys are doing"
Ska,3ddwmu,skankersores,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:12:33 2015 UTC,"Bummer! It was booked last minute so this was the only venue I could get on such short notice. Usually it would be at the Middle East or somewhere closer to the city. If you'd like, you can still support the touring artists by buying an album on their bandcamp, every bit counts to keep the scene going"
Ska,3ddwmu,Lerch737,2,Thu Jul 16 04:30:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured it was last minute when there was no Boston date originally. Always try and do what I can though!

Ska,3dbc69,Moongoat,3,Wed Jul 15 11:15:44 2015 UTC,"Pensacola. Ska used to be decently big here. Bands like shut up travis, taj motel trio, and stereohype played here pretty regularly and we had a good amount of way out of town ska bands coming through as well as a couple local mainstays but when the main venue everyone played at closed down it all slowed down a lot. There's still a punk following and a ton of post hardcore bands, and if you're less than jake or something then a lot of people will show up but if you're just a nobody local ska band  you won't really get a ton of support around here."
Ska,3dbc69,JediWeAre,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:57:33 2015 UTC,"I'm originally from Pensacola (Gulf Breeze, actually), and the only ska show I've seen there was LTJ.  I'd sure as hell have come to see you if I'd known.  Any notable groups still playing in the area?"
Ska,3dbc69,Treelociraptor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:34:16 2015 UTC,"Everytime LTJ comes it's an absolute blast but almost nothing tops the atmosphere of the local ska scene when it was around. No one around here is still together unfortunately, there's some new ones trying to start though. Our biggest mainstay around here for a while was Out of Nothing. I would go to their shows a few times a week in high school and they are the reason I even got seriously into ska and joined a band. Then they broke up and got together under a different name and them and my band got to open up for Big D. It was the highlight of my ska ""career"""

Ska,3d2c2y,wonderliv,13,Sun Jul 12 23:28:01 2015 UTC,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Specials_(album)  ""Many songs on The Specials' debut album were covers of older Jamaican songs. ""Monkey Man"" had been a hit for Toots & the Maytals in 1969, ""Too Hot"" was a Prince Buster original from 1966, and the opening track, ""A Message to You, Rudy"" was a Dandy Livingstone single in 1967. ""You're Wondering Now"" was originally performed by The Skatalites; a vocal version was recorded by duo Andy and Joey in 1964. Other tracks are reworkings of Jamaican originals: ""Too Much Too Young"" was based on Lloyd Charmers' ""Birth Control"" and ""Stupid Marriage"" draws heavily on the Prince Buster hit ""Judge 400 Years"" (also known as ""Judge Dread"")."""
Ska,3d2c2y,billsuspect,3,Mon Jul 13 01:09:48 2015 UTC,"I think it is possible for a song to be both a cover or a reworking and still be influential. When the Specials' Too Much Too Young Live E.P. went to number 1 in the UK, it sounded like nothing that had gone before, despite owing a nod to Birth Control. For a live recorded proto-ska punk song, lasting less than 2 minutes to get to the top of the charts in 1980 still seems extraordinary now."

It's one of their biggest hits so I'd think people would be expecting to hear it but I understand they must be sick of playing it."
Ska,3csow2,Powerpuff-Kuma,2,Fri Jul 10 21:35:26 2015 UTC,"As it was already pointed out, they did play Impression last night, but they are exceptionally good at mixing things up. I've seen them 13 times as of last night and there's only 4 songs they've played at every show. There were plenty of ""hits""/regulars in the setlist that got skipped last night in favor of rarer tunes - Devil's Night Out, Everybody's Better, You Gotta Go, 1-2-8, Dr. D, etc. The Bosstones really love Buffalo (they've been known to refer to it as their second hometown), so they usually mix things up really well there."

Ska,3cu66c,halflitfluorescents,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:21:18 2015 UTC,"What are some good skacore bands? I confess that I see skacore as an abomination of the genre, but maybe that's just because I haven't heard any good skacore"
Ska,3cu66c,boblahblahblah,2,Fri Jul 10 22:51:05 2015 UTC,"The Bosstones, Operation Ivy, Suicide Machines, MU330. Dude, really? Ska-core is what go me into ska. I later found The Specials, Skatalites, Toots & The Maytals and Desmond Dekker. Check out my podcast for tons more great ska-core. Too many to list. http://skafreaks.com/skageek.php"
Ska,3cu66c,skageek,2,Sat Jul 11 00:37:30 2015 UTC,Bosstones are skacore?
Ska,3cu66c,boblahblahblah,2,Sat Jul 11 00:55:25 2015 UTC,"Some of their older stuff might be on the border of skacore, but I definitely wouldn't call them skacore.   Also, check out Voodoo Glow Skulls."

Ska,3cu66c,skageek,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:32:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree on OPIV but would argue that MU330 is ska-core. Very metal influenced.  I put them both in the same vein though. Not 2-Tone or trad."
Ska,3cu66c,skageek,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:21:02 2015 UTC,I still 100% disagree about mu330. You can have metal influence and not entirely show it in the music. Just because Ted uses a double pedal doesn't automatically make them a skacore band.
Ska,3cu66c,skageek,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:35:54 2015 UTC,There are still all the metal riffs but I see where you are coming from. One of my favorite bands. They rule.
Ska,3cu66c,skageek,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:46:32 2015 UTC,"Same - mu330 and The Flaming Tsunamis are the only bands that actually matter in music. My whole beef with the skacore debate is when people only refer to the bands that don't really fall into the genre or can really go either way, while there are bands like A Billion Ernies, Public Access, and The Best of the Worst that 100% fall into the genre."

I think it's a step into a bit more conventional territory, but the lyrics are as good as ever and the music is incredibly written. I miss their early stuff sometimes, but I'm happy that they're going in a direction that's natural for them."

Ska,3cnr0r,Falcon-Seven,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:41:13 2015 UTC,"I actually like ... And the Battle Begins more than any other of their albums (their 2nd newest one I believe?) but yeah I agree for the newest. Still pretty awesome though, whenever I explain to friends I call them ""the Muse of ska bands"" - so progressive and I find a lot a similarities in the lyrics / when he riffs.  yes I like Muse, shhh"
Ska,3cnr0r,Moongoat,2,Thu Jul 9 19:28:35 2015 UTC,"I think that most RXB fans would agree that ATBB is their best album. That's the album that truly got me into their message and taught me what they were all about. After that, I gained so much respect for them both as musicians and as genuine people.   After a show in Orlando, I went out behind the place for a smoke and Matt was just chillin on the curb and talking to people. My girlfriend and I sat down and spoke to him about just random things, the area, food, armchair philosophy, whatever. I took a picture of my girl and him with her arm around her and I can honestly say I'm not even mad. It was a fantastic night."
Ska,3cnr0r,numba1chief_rocka,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:41:04 2015 UTC,"That's one thing I could totally agree with. While their new album isn't by any means my favorite, their progression as a band feels so natural. Everything is so well written and put together.. but then each album is different enough from the one previous that the new material doesn't seem like recycled songwriting. I'll go for weeks where I'll just put on their discography and listen to it from oldest to newest over and over; at work, in the car, while running, whenever. The only other band I can honestly say I feel that way about is Streetlight. And then their live show, oh my Lawd! They are on a whole other level. I just really love RXB. haha"
Ska,3covfw,smalltim,3,Thu Jul 9 16:14:30 2015 UTC,Since I first heard the Beatdown a couple years back I liked them but they are recently becoming a favorite.

In the past few years, it has been rare to hear any songs from it on their set lists, despite producing the title track (Unstoppable), the listed track (Do No Wrong), Bullets To The Ground (a song that was regularly played for a few years), Raise Your Glass, and maybe one or two others."

Ska,3c35tx,b00mhsh0t,6,Sat Jul 4 14:50:47 2015 UTC,"I prefer the catch 22 version to. I heard streetlight was forced to re-record the record by their record company, so maybe that's why it doesn't sound as good as the early catch 22 version :D"
Ska,3c35tx,Poepeter,5,Sat Jul 4 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"Yea exactly! Sounds so forced, but it sounds cleaner I guess? Catch 22 version has that raw amateur feeling that I love in ska."
Ska,3c35tx,b00mhsh0t,2,Sat Jul 4 15:01:47 2015 UTC,A few weeks ago I saw Catch 22 play their first show in 3 years. You could tell they were a little rusty but still had that energy. They played this song and it was great! Same raw feeling as on the record just with a different vocalist.
Ska,3c35tx,kobun04,4,Sun Jul 5 00:09:21 2015 UTC,"They weren't forced, but Victory records did want to re-release the album untouched. Tomas offered to re-record the entire album but they refused, and so he and the rest of Streetlight went touring and just gathering all the money that they could to record it themselves"
Ska,3c35tx,Psychic_Monkey,2,Sun Jul 5 01:22:33 2015 UTC,never noticed that till you pointed it out as much as i love streetlights keasbey nights it does seem forced
Ska,3c35tx,zeeli,4,Sat Jul 4 16:27:12 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkJuhTlo9Ok  I found the interview where Tomas talks about re-recording the album at about the 5 minute mark.
Ska,3c35tx,Poepeter,4,Sat Jul 4 16:52:56 2015 UTC,"As great of a source as that is, you kind of don't need it. Imo the breakdown part of 1234 1234 Kalnoky expresses his feelings about the record. He feels indifferent about the record and says that it happened and that you can take it however you like. He also said that they (assuming both members of streetlight and catch) ""wanted to prevent the rerelease"" of the record. The whole part is basically a big F.U. to victory, which most certainly set the stage to Kalnoky's current sentiments towards the record company."
Ska,3c35tx,TiggsMC,3,Sat Jul 4 19:12:24 2015 UTC,Victory did end up rereleasing the Catch version on vinyl. I bought it at a record shop the other day. Misspelled Riding The Fourth Wave as Ridding The Fourth Wave.
Ska,3c35tx,kobun04,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:05:51 2015 UTC,My buddy has that same record. I never saw the track listing as I already knew it and I was just wanted to pop it on ASAP! Although I'd love a vinyl release of the original Catch Keasbey Nights.

I was in the pit for The D so I only heard Rob Zombie from a distant. I was getting confused when he played 2 James Brown covers.  System of a Down was pretty awesome.

Play the songs in spotify or youtube or whatever to see if they match up to what you're looking for. That's the best answer I can give
Ska,3aso0j,skankersores,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:43:10 2015 UTC,Thanks man! Just didn't know if anyone else had been to the tour and heard the song.
Ska,3ao4z3,Boomation,10,Mon Jun 22 02:56:57 2015 UTC,"Just pointing out the obvious...  ..    That's a stylized cover of ""You're Wondering Now"" Originally by the Skatalites.  ..  Just in case."
Ska,3ao4z3,MarkHughesy,3,Mon Jun 22 04:09:46 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure ""You're Wondering Now"" is by the Specials."
Ska,3ao4z3,PapaPeyton,8,Mon Jun 22 04:11:50 2015 UTC,"That's where I first heard it, but nope, Skatalites. (For mass production.)  It may have been a local song preformed by many artists around Studio One in the late 50's, early 60's, but Skatalites were the first to record and sell, I believe.  Here is a version from 1965, Predating the Specials  **This isn't the Skatalites version, but I can't find my old vinyl.  I was sure I had it on a Studio One album from the 60's."
Ska,3ao4z3,MarkHughesy,4,Mon Jun 22 04:29:48 2015 UTC,"The Skatalites may have been the backing band, but the original song is credited to ""Andy & Joey"" (Rueben Anderson & Joann Dennis).   The Skatalites added it to their live set in the mid-90s."
Ska,3ao4z3,slopduck,2,Mon Jun 22 15:05:54 2015 UTC,Next you're going to tell me the Specials didn't write Guns of Navarone!  /s
Ska,3ao4z3,Napalmradio,-3,Mon Jun 22 18:15:22 2015 UTC,Its the specials
Ska,3ao4z3,bijoudarling,5,Mon Jun 22 05:13:38 2015 UTC,"Again, no it isn't.  I'm not trying to be a dink, but if we have a recording from 1965 (as posted above..)  then how would it be the Specials?  12 Years before the Coventry Automatic, which would later become the Specials.  Isn't it more likely they covered the songs they enjoyed, like those from the first wave of Ska?"
Ska,3ao4z3,MarkHughesy,2,Mon Jun 22 06:58:19 2015 UTC,"Hahaha. Sorry, I find it funny that you have to correct this again. You're Wondering Now is old school Jamaican Ska. The Specials covered it like they did a lot of songs.   Its my second favorite Skatalites song, first probably has to be Sugar Sugar, which is probably a cover they did of another song."
Ska,3ao4z3,marrowisyummy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:02:04 2015 UTC,"Ha, yes, if you're referring to the ""Sugar Sugar"" track that Doreen sings, it was originally voiced by Doreen in 1979 over an old Sound Dimension rhythm. The original credits Laurel Aitken as the composer, but I can't locate any trace of him recording it prior to the 90s. Still he wrote a huge number of songs, and since Coxsone was loathe to credit anyone other than himself on releases, it does suggest that Laurel may have really written it.  So yes, in effect any Skatalites version of ""Sugar Sugar"" is a cover.  Edit to add RKR does mention a ""Sugar Sugar"" in 1970, credited to ""Silver & Noreen"" on Columbia Blue Beat. Laurel did do some work with Siggy Jackson (who ran Columbia Blue Beat), so that may be the key (and maybe ""Noreen"" is Doreen?). I can't locate any sound clips of that track though. I'll ask the knowledgable folks on the Pama forum.  I have been informed that the 1970 track is a skinhead reggae version of The Archies ""Sugar, Sugar"", so has nothing to do with the song in question  Edit 2 Brian Keyo, the Skatalites biographer and probably the foremost expert on the band told me that Laurel wrote the song for Doreen around 1977, but didn't record it himself until the 90s."
Ska,3ao4z3,slopduck,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:02:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was listening to this on the way to work this morning, its the live version on ""In The Mood for Ska"" and before the dude introduces Doreen, he even says ""This is a Laurel Aitken composition"""

Ska,3a9vmr,LessThanNate,3,Thu Jun 18 19:40:11 2015 UTC,"I miss Solly's too. But I had to haul (literally) a thousand pounds of sound gear up that insane flight of stairs every month just to make it sound decent (and then back downstairs usually after 3-20 beers)... Only to have barely 20 or 30 people show up for shows.  There were some minor internal issues too (but that's anywhere you go). Since moving to Bossa, we have yet to have a crappy turn out.   I miss the crew at Sollys there though - Samantha is my favorite DC bartender. Good times."
Ska,3a9vmr,DuncanShifter,3,Thu Jun 18 19:48:29 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want to do that sort of hauling, so I totally understand.

Ska,3a9vmr,DuncanShifter,4,Thu Jun 18 15:39:20 2015 UTC,"Vinyl, mainly. They weren't much of a band who put out a ton of merchandise (though I wish I hung on to the tshirts I bought at their concerts). Actually, there's not a lot to collect vinyl-wise, either. But yeah, I've shown records to Danny Elfman he had no idea existed. I also own all the coveted shit like the Mystic Knights era pressings, the Demo EP and the Penthouse Live record. Plus, any oddball stuff I can find like test presses of Only a Lad. Things like that. They're not a hard band to collect - a trip to Ebay with a hundred bucks can probably yield most items out there... But the rarer pressings are unimaginably hard to get."

I used to have a ska band and we covered a few of their songs and the best thing about their song writing was all the little details, riffs, transitions and the horn and vocal harmonies. Now they just don't have those kind of songs, just pretty basic ska stuff, to me the sound more like a RBF cover band than RBF."

Saki (the trumpet player) was playing on the bar for a decent portion of the show, and they did a lot of songs together with BIGNOUN.

Ska,39ugry,mbsargent,3,Mon Jun 15 03:07:08 2015 UTC,How was the show? I'm seeing them Friday in NH.
Ska,39ugry,Lerch737,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:59:37 2015 UTC,I loved it. Both LTJ & RBF put on a great show. But as u/skankersores noted the crowd was very tame. There was a lot of factors that attributed to that  1) It was a 21+ show so the crowd was kinda older  2) It was an outdoor show and the weather sucked  3) The Blackhawks were playing a Stanley Cup final game at the same time so lots of people were paying attention to the game
Ska,39ugry,Lerch737,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:26:58 2015 UTC,"1) as I'm approaching 30 this year I completely understand this 2) That sucks, last outdoor show I went to it rained, luckly the staff was nice enough to tell everyone outside not under the tent to come stand around the edges so you're not getting completely soaked 3) As a life long hockey guy, I completely understand this."
Ska,39ugry,skankersores,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:04:30 2015 UTC,"Hey, same. The venue is pretty smallish (like a lot of them on this leg of the tour seem to have been) and they put on a killer show. Reel Big Fish is very fun especially if it's your first time seeing them. Less Than Jake really entertain up there.  Expect a circle pit of sorts. Like a pit..with the vague idea that it wants to go in a circle, nothing too crazy."
Ska,39ugry,Lerch737,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:30:27 2015 UTC,"Seen both of them live. RBF was ahwile ago, but I remember the LTJ show when they opened for the BossTones. I remember alot of banter between songs and a general feel of them not, not taking it seriously but definitely having alot of fun doing it.   Are you planning on getting to the venue early? I'm thinking about pregaming a bit if your interested"

If you like the mash of sounds, the track SB6 goes through about 12 different styles, it can be found on Sounds to Consume, the Sonic Boom Six EP, and their Demo.  Other great tracks are Piggy in the Middle, People Acklike They Don't Know, The Rape of Punk to Come, Bigger then Punk Rock, Don't Say I Never Warned Ya, and Blood For Oil."
Ska,39r4sj,Dieselite,6,Sun Jun 14 00:13:02 2015 UTC,Each album up to and including City of Thieves is great. The albums after that are an acquired taste. not bad just different.
Ska,39r4sj,Voodoo_Biscuit,2,Sat Jun 13 23:28:48 2015 UTC,"check out their music video for ""all in"", the music video runs off of the single version instead of the album version of the song and has a lot more attitude in it imo.  good band though, definitely worth checking out."
Ska,39r4sj,MGee9,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:47:04 2015 UTC,One of the best bands around. I love the mix of the different genres to make a unique sound. I also like dubstep a lot so this band is a perfect fit for me. Definitely check them out if you haven't already.

Ska,39l15b,NoFaithInPeopleAnyMo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:08:35 2015 UTC,"Ok, so this raises a lot of questions since this is the first time i'm hearing about shadowbanning. Can you elucidate me about it? So, only mods can do this, right? Next question: why? What rule am I breaking here? Why can I see your comment, but not the other two? And what can I do about this?"
Ska,39l15b,NoFaithInPeopleAnyMo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:30:56 2015 UTC,"Shadow bans are not done by mods, they are done by admins. Basically, your account appears to work. You can post and comment, but nobody can see it, unless that subs mod approves it. It was originally for spammers, but it really isn't clear why they are given out. Basically admins can be pussies and remove you without you ever noticing. It's entirely at their discretion. Recently there was a guy who was shadowbanned for two years and finally contacted the admins and they re activated him. They shadowbanned him for posting the same link twice in different subreddits.   If you go back and look at some of the announcement posts, a lot of users want the admins to come out and explain it but they have yet to say anything about it.   As for the two here, who knows. They could have just said something to somebody that knows an admin well, and requested a shadow ban. It gets really clique-y near the top."
Ska,39l15b,NoFaithInPeopleAnyMo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:04:48 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks for all the info. Just a couple more questions. Am I shadowbanned from this subreddit only, or from reddit in total? How does one know that another user has been shadowbanned? And who do I contact about this? Do I go to the 'contact us' section and click 'message the admins'?"

Ska,39log1,arjund,3,Sat Jun 13 00:06:30 2015 UTC,"There was a lot of tension within the band before they did the initial recording, and the recording sessions themselves were pretty emotionally difficult. Maybe they wanted to get the bad taste out of their mouths. The new recording sounds a lot cleaner as well. Not surprising given the advances in recording technology since the early 80s. I think this recording was done in the past few years, but I can't nail down a specific year. released Jan 15, 2008."

Ska,39j7uk,TheBear88,2,Fri Jun 12 03:20:50 2015 UTC,"I love FiF. When I was younger, I knew their songs so well that I used to play a game with my coworkers that also loved them equally as well.  It was this :   You say any two to three words from any FiF song. Person you're playing against has to name the song, the album, who said the words (normally Reese) and approximately when it was said in the song.. So for example 2m23s. Person got two chances. If they can't do it, you get a point. If they got it they get a point.    Them the other person picks the song.  We were always neck and neck for our whole shift at work for points because we had nearly all the words memorized from all the albums."
Ska,39j7uk,BMFWalker,11,Fri Jun 12 09:03:20 2015 UTC,FIF is one of the few religious ska bands that I can still listen to and enjoy as much as I used to when I was very religious.  Thank you for reminding me of how awesome they are.

I will do a vast injustice to Reese's beautiful wording if I try to explain everything he has said about him still being a Christian yet respecting his atheist band members' views, and how some of his views have changed since they broke up.  If you feel like hunting it down and reading it, he says it all in his song explanations on their website. Well worth the read. :)"
Ska,39j7uk,RustyRapeaXe,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:31:30 2015 UTC,You know they put out a new album last year right?

Ska,39j7uk,shoppewithanE,3,Fri Jun 12 15:45:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think some other ska Christian bands (Eg the oc Supertones ) are more appealing to more Christian crowds because they aren't as talented but are more heavily religious (IMO). FiF are just really talented, so they can appeal to a lot more people."

Ska,39j7uk,BIGlikeaBOSS,2,Fri Jun 12 08:50:31 2015 UTC,"They really keep the religious aspect toned down. I saw them on their reunion tour, and the opener before them was louder about religious stuff."

Ska,39j7uk,Tinnitusaurium,2,Fri Jun 12 08:02:41 2015 UTC,"Well I think FiF are just really talented, regardless of their message. Their music is way deeper than other third wave ska bands (like Reel Big Fish). Its almost as if Streetlight and Reel Big Fish had a baby, and the baby became Christian.

Ska,39jgjk,Breadbox25,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:59:07 2015 UTC,"LTJ and RBF are on tour as we speak. RBF will even occasionally do shows at smaller venues. I live in a pretty podunk city in west Texas, and they ended up doing a show right here. The sax player told me they were pretty much going to take a loss on the whole tour, but it wasn't about the money: it was about fan engagement and breaking in new members.  I don't know about Streetlight, but Big D played at the Hometown Throwdown in December, so I'm pretty sure they're active."

Ska,39jgjk,drpiefinger,2,Fri Jun 12 04:06:14 2015 UTC,That's probably what they charge to play a one-off private party type gig where they have to travel and etc.  They probably make a lot less than that at their regular tour gigs.

Ska,395xmq,urgentlyrelaxed,2,Wed Jun 10 03:55:24 2015 UTC,"1) Have money 2) Have money 3) Have money  Getting over to Australia is expensive, unfortunately. We miss heaps of good bands because we live over on this godforsaken island :P  I can't work out the logistics for you, but to put together some shows, I highly recommend contacting (I'll go by state here): Queensland: - Jobstopper - The Mouldy Lovers - Fire Away!  New South Wales: - The Porkers - Los Capitanes - Ebolagoldfish - Chris Duke and the Royals - Angry Little Gods - Edema Ruh  Victoria: - The Stiffys - The Resignators - The Kujo Kings - The Quarters  South Australia: - Us (The Prophets of Impending Doom) - God God Dammit Dammit - Tony Font Show - Any or all of my other bands - Silent Duck, Funk Latin Union, Boneseed. - Babylon Burning - The Pugs  Not all of them are ska, but they are certainly welcome at ska shows and fit in with the general vibe of an Aussie ska show (The Stiffys are particularly hilarious). Note the ONLY ska band in South Australia is the Prophets. All others are on hiatus or defunct as far as I know.  Our capital Canberra is very small, and Perth (in Western Australia) is more than twice as far away as Adelaide is from the eastern coast, so don't waste your money there.  A lot of bands go the following order: - Brisbane - Sydney - Melbourne - Adelaide You can try one or two shows at each place.  YHA Hostels are cheap and, surprisingly for hostels, pretty secure. (I've heard of hostel horror stories, I know people in the band the Beards, if you've heard of them?). I recommend them over hotels as hotels will absolutely DESTROY your budget.  I've given you some pointers (and local band names), but I'm not really that good at organising shows (my band has no gigs until August) so you'll need to do your own research regarding the other cities' venues, but when it comes to Adelaide, I can help with booking/promotion.  Ask away if you have more questions! I'll try my best to answer all the questions, I'd love more ska bands to come and skank down under!"

However if you're looking for clean, as in smooth, I'd suggest listening to 60s era Jamaican Ska and Rocksteady - probably starting with Prince Buster and Desmond Dekker since they're probably the most accessible to the uninitiated.

They played a good mix of new and old like Doug Hastings, Sugar in Your Gas Tank, Johnny Quest, and Happyman, as well as Plastic Cup Politics, The Science of Selling Yourself Short, Rest of My Life, Overrated(the crowd was suprisingly into it) and two songs off of See the Light, but I can't remember what because I'm awful with song names. I can't promise they'll play all of this when you see them, but they tend to keep their setlist consistent across the tour. I've seen Less Than Jake at least twice a year for like 8 or 9 years now, and this time around was one of their best sets. They were killer and the set list was fantastic. Have fun! :D"

Watching a bunch of guys having fun on stage, actually dancing (coordinated and choreographed) to their music while sounding awesome was way cool to see live. I've loved them ever since!

Back in the 90's when they were just starting, we all hated them in the OC scene. They were a joke. Pretty much ripoffs of RBF, JFC (whom I always disliked) and all the other late 90's ska bands that were out there.   But in the end, over 10 years later, still around. Kudos to them for keeping it going."

(I loved their disco pop phase btw) Day Job was a fantastic return to their ska roots, but this album just seems to lack the same feeling.   There are definitely a few tracks I like (the title track is a great anthem for anybody who has ever been in that position), but they are few and far between. Maybe it'll take a few more listens to grow on me, but initially I feel it's just not a great album from track to track. They're great guys so I'll still support them, but I never thought I would not enjoy an SL album from the start."
Ska,387qi2,chgbfm,2,Wed Jun 3 12:26:39 2015 UTC,"I really like it but I kinda feel the same way.  It's a terrific album but Day Job and Rump Shaker set the bar waaaaaaaaay up there for what I expect of SL.  It's very laid back, the lack of energy is what I'm not clicking with.  It's growing on me, but it's probably going to be something I play for chilling out."

Personally, I'm more in favor of inclusion rather than exclusion when it comes to this subreddit's content, so I don't mind this sort of stuff being posted or upvoted here.  This isn't a default subreddit, so I think the votes are fairly representative of what people want out of it. I'm not going to disagree about whether or not this is ska, because you're right, it isn't. However, because he's indisputably part of the scene, I think his music is relevant to this subreddit even if it doesn't strictly qualify as part of the genre."
Ska,37vvze,sillybear25,3,Sun May 31 07:22:54 2015 UTC,"Tomas is a relevant artist, but does that mean everything he makes ought to be posted here? I think not. It's like saying the non-ska songs by Sublime should be posted here because they've made ska in the past."
Ska,37vvze,CookieMan0,0,Sun May 31 14:48:17 2015 UTC,"You've got a good point. I would probably be okay with Sublime's punk/dub/reggae stuff being posted here, but I could see a lot of people disagreeing with that.  Ultimately, this is still a pretty small subreddit, so I don't think it's in any real danger of losing focus. If it ever gets to be big enough that that's a problem, I wouldn't mind if the moderators decided to set and enforce stricter standards; I just don't think that it's necessary with the current state of /r/Ska, and I personally like seeing the variety from the occasional ska- or reggae-inspired track even if it isn't actually ska."

There was actually a documentary about the band trying to make it during the ska-boom of 1997, and it's a pretty cool watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsG7bnwLYg"

Has a mix of ska, ska/punk, punk songs and more.      Survay Says! - Observations of the Human Condition I've been a fan of the band for awhile, and helped kickstarter the album, but I didn't think to toss the CD into my car and listen to it as an album until last month. It was fantastic to listen to it start to finish while driving.    Also, if you're going to playing stuff off an mp3 player, hit up my podcast [23min of Ska](www.23ska.com) and download a whole bunch of episodes for the drive."

I was never a big fan of DHC until I heard that album. They had so much energy live! The studio recordings don't do the band justice. I always thought that maybe the major label told them to tone it down? But this live album was released on an imprint of Fat Wreck Chords so I guess they just let loose."

Ska,37ef80,SeanPMcF,7,Wed May 27 00:51:58 2015 UTC,"Very good, you've got a good songwriting style.  Both lyrically and musically, I like it.  My recommendations: Work on using your chest voice and mask voices.  I know there are a lot of bands that do the nasal thing, mask and chest voices have more personality.  I think that would work better with the song.  Flesh out the guitar and bass in the mix.  The horn lines hit some weird beats in the intro to the second verse.  The song is pretty straightforward in terms of timing and key, it sounds off.  All of that's just around the edges, being where you are after 3 months is impressive."
