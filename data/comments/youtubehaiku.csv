youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,bloodybart,38,Mon Jul 20 21:17:47 2015 UTC,"I thnk they were firefighters in training. They were in a classroom and they had fire gear at the back of the room. The sound he plays would be the alarm for a drill and everyone in the room is stomping on the floor to make it sound like they are running to get ready.  He was asleep and suddenly hears the alarm and thinks, ""SHIT. I need to go get my gear on."" That's why he runs to the door."
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,wemlin14,11,Mon Jul 20 21:55:11 2015 UTC,"Yup. When you work in emergency services you get used to going into motion without thinking as soon as you hear tones drop. One time, I was visiting my aunt and uncle and sleeping in their guest room. I didn't realize that my uncle had a scanner in the office next door that he didn't turn off at night (he was a volunteer EMT for their county). At about 2am when I was dead asleep, I heard tones drop and I was up out of bed with my pants on and grabbing the door handle before I realized I wasn't at work, I wasn't even in my own town, those weren't our tones.  note: I worked in a service that did not get multiple tones in our quarters, so I never had to develop the skill of zoning out other tones and only listening for my own."

I guess if the noise they're trying to simulate is the bustle of people getting ready, then that's a pretty harmless prank.  From the crappy audio, my thought was that maybe they were trying to simulate gunshot sounds (maybe they were police or soldiers in training?), in which case I wouldn't be on board with the prank."
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,bloodybart,4,Mon Jul 20 22:37:17 2015 UTC,It's everyone else in the room moving their feet to make it sound like a lot is going on. Look at the people behind the sleeping man.

youtubehaiku,3du4kp,xSPYXEx,45,Sun Jul 19 17:38:23 2015 UTC,youtubehaiku is fantastic but the self-deprecating tone of meirl and the comment sections definitely make it for me
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,victionicious,51,Sun Jul 19 17:42:46 2015 UTC,"The comment sections? I've always thought the least funny part of that sub is the actual people there. It's just forced memes and apparently long chains of ""me too thanks"" is still comedy gold."
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,not_enough_characte,27,Sun Jul 19 19:22:22 2015 UTC,"indeed. if the humour of your sub has peaked at ""thank Mr skeltal"" and ""me too thanks"" you're doing something wrong."

youtubehaiku,3du4kp,large_butt,9,Mon Jul 20 13:17:13 2015 UTC,"The sub was way better when it was smaller, people only posted pictures and there were zero comments on each one.

But one of those askreddit threads titled something like ""Reddit, what's one smaller subreddit you'd like to ruin by having a bigger community?"" came through and destroyed /r/me_irl. Really sad, it used to be my favorite subreddit :("

It's probably not such a bad subreddit if you ignore the comments, but it's hard to not want to see what other people thought about the pictures. But to each their own, I suppose!"

youtubehaiku,3du4kp,deltaak,130,Sun Jul 19 16:49:39 2015 UTC,"Puppy, potty-training, crate-training (e.g. teach it ""this is your room"")  Crates from what I've learned are basically like indoor doghouses.  A place for them to call their own."
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,registered_just4this,7,Sun Jul 19 17:36:09 2015 UTC,"That's right. A lot of people think it's like a time out or something, but it's really about how you treat the cage. If you put the dog in there when it does something bad, it will see the cage as time out. But if you teach the dog that he can just chill in there and horde all his toys or whatever, they love going in there."
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,jerekdeter626,86,Mon Jul 20 11:03:14 2015 UTC,"it's pretty common to do with puppies while you're training them to not chew on shit, piss in the house, etc.  Also, when you put the dog in the cage at night and let them out in the morning, you train them to understand ""This is where I go at night. This is where I sleep."" Eventually, you remove the cage and leave the bed and they'll still sleep there at night. It's also good for if you're cooking and you can't have them running around the kitchen. You just say ""DOG. BED."" and they understand that they have to go lie down in their spot."

youtubehaiku,3du4kp,HawthorneMan,11,Sun Jul 19 19:52:39 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'll put my dog in her kennel at night when everyone's about to go to bed. Otherwise, as long as someone's home, she'll be out and about."
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,Aetern1ty,10,Sun Jul 19 17:11:16 2015 UTC,"Good write up here, although there are many other resources: http://m.humanesociety.org/animals/dogs/tips/crate_training.html The dog could be in the crate for many various reasons while you're at home. We can't assume these people are neglecting the dog. We can't assume they are the greatest owner's on earth, either. But understanding crate training typically leads me to feel no alarm when I see something like this, unless there are obvious negative cues."
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,Tadddd,6,Sun Jul 19 17:45:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe the dog is not potty trained or cannot be trusted when home alone, and the owner had just arrived home."
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,Blakertonpotts,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:22:46 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend has to keep her dog in a kennel while she is at work. He is good when she is around, but if she is gone he freaks out and begins destroying stuff.   Her mom or I will stop by at points during the day to take him outside, get him some excercize and time out of the kennel.   Whenever someone is there, he is free."
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,Aphelion1756,-5,Sun Jul 19 22:53:25 2015 UTC,"This is mainly, but not exclusively, an american thing. Many americans, it seems, think a dog left alone at home will inevitably eat and gnaw on everything. Also, in the states, the idea that you need it for potty-training is rather widespread.  Funny how our dog is potty trained and has the whole apartment to roam as she likes at night or when we're away. Doesn't even go into the kitchen to look for a snack (she's not allowed in there). Dogs are smart and easily trainable, after all.  If I had to keep the dog in a crate, I'd not have a dog, simple as that."
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,hibbel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:03:14 2015 UTC,"In Sweden it's illegal to keep dogs in closed crates, which means we have to train them to be alone. It's not that hard, and I'm glad my dog can walk around in an area bigger than a small crate whenever I leave her."
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,Horspel,-13,Tue Jul 21 07:46:17 2015 UTC,"Another reason, no one has mentioned, is that when a dog misbehaves, you put them in their cage. If you don't intend of having the cage there for them all the time, it can be used as a form of punishment.  Our dog, a Shih Tzu, has a large amount of poodle in him. He's at least twice the size of his largest siblings and weights probably over 20lbs and he is not fat at all. Like, he's pretty fucking cut. We walk him a lot and hardly ever feet him table scraps, if we do it's like apples and shit. He loves it.  Anyways, he would bite as a puppy, mostly for play but then he would start doing it more seriously. But it never really hurt and we didn't know he would get to be so damn big. So when he got to be about full size, he'd still bite (mostly just me) so we'd put him in a cage like this for a few hours. He never liked it, so it made for a good form of punishment. Now, the most he will do is garnish his teeth but a firm look and a raised voice will shut him up."
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,JayStar1213,19,Sun Jul 19 20:40:28 2015 UTC,Crates are never supposed to be used as punishment. You basically trained your dog to bite and then punished it for it.
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,cspikes,-10,Sun Jul 19 21:21:32 2015 UTC,What? No one trained the dog to bite. We ignored it at first when he was puppy because it wasn't a big deal (we thought).  We needed to stop the bitting when he got bigger so it helped. He doesn't bite and is more than happy. Better off than most people's dogs who just get fat and depressed because their owners are too lazy to take care of them.
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,JayStar1213,8,Sun Jul 19 22:23:23 2015 UTC,"No one trained the dog to bite. We ignored it at first when he was puppy because it wasn't a big deal (we thought).   That's how you trained him. You might not have meant to do it, but you taught him that it's okay to bite when you didn't correct him as a puppy. Dogs take all their cues from you and how you react to their behavior."
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,mojave_merc,-2,Mon Jul 20 00:30:29 2015 UTC,"Alright, there's a difference between not correcting and actually training. No one trained the dog to bite people. That's just asinine. You purposely worded that to make it sound like we went out of our way to insure the dog would bite people."
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,JayStar1213,3,Mon Jul 20 00:50:52 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? That's not at all what I said. You can train a dog to misbehave the same way you can train a child to misbehave. When I say ""train"", I do not mean that you specifically gave him commands to bite and then rewarded him with a Snausage whenever he did. I mean it exactly the way I said it; if you don't correct behavior, you are teaching a dog that it's okay to continue that behavior. Like I said, you don't have to have the intent to get that result."
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,mojave_merc,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:01:43 2015 UTC,So then what's the problem with correcting that issue with a kennel?
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,JayStar1213,4,Mon Jul 20 01:04:54 2015 UTC,"Because a kennel is supposed to be a dog's safe place, where they go to get away from any kind of stress and where they can be content; using it as punishment makes them associate the kennel with something negative, which is the opposite of what you want. If you do that, then every time you send your dog to his kennel, he'll think he's done something wrong, even if that's not why you're putting him there. It's too confusing for them."
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,mojave_merc,-4,Mon Jul 20 01:30:38 2015 UTC,We never used the kennel for any other reason than punishment (Except for the first few months we got him). Which is why it worked. He has his own places in the house he calls his own. Under the bed for example.
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,JayStar1213,6,Mon Jul 20 02:31:43 2015 UTC,"Allowing the biting behaviour was a bad move. I made the same mistake and now I have a 65lb golden retriever whose favourite game is to nibble your fingers. Similar situation, though, in that he will only do it to people he's comfortable with.   Also you shouldn't use the crate as punishment - it's their den and it should be where they go to relax. You're essentially caging your pet as punishment there."
youtubehaiku,3du4kp,joemckie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:37:10 2015 UTC,"Yah, first dog so we learned. But nothing bad ever really came from it and he now has a firm understanding of the difference between play biting and real biting.   And we let him sleep or lay wherever he wants. He has his own little areas he likes to go to within the house and we can tell him to go there if we need him to.  The kennel was only used for him as a puppy during his first few months as we were training him. Then again around the age of 1 for the few weeks we trained him to stop biting. He hasn't been in it since. I don't see why this is a big deal. He's very well behaved now, so it seems like it was a good move."

youtubehaiku,3dt6g3,Semantiks,2,Sun Jul 19 14:36:03 2015 UTC,It's not a hate on US esports and the fact that you think that makes you massively naive and probably closed minded.

youtubehaiku,3dmejk,expi_ala_doshus,7,Fri Jul 17 14:35:00 2015 UTC,I would recommend a good topical treatment like Frontline or Advantage over a collar. I have heard some nasty things about collars and some banal things like they just don't work that well.
youtubehaiku,3dmejk,mydearwatson616,5,Fri Jul 17 15:10:26 2015 UTC,"Actually people have been using Frontline and Advantage so long that a lot of fleas and ticks are immune to it now, so they don't work nearly as well as they used to. It's better to go with lesser known brands that use different chemicals.  At least that's what someone told me when I worked at PetSmart."
youtubehaiku,3dmejk,expi_ala_doshus,4,Fri Jul 17 16:47:39 2015 UTC,I have heard that as well.  I use Frontline and have no issues.   So whatever works for you I guess.
youtubehaiku,3dmejk,Simim,3,Fri Jul 17 17:24:16 2015 UTC,"It highly depends on the area. Some areas and their surrounding have tolerant fleas/ticks because of this, while others do not.  The best solution, I've found, is just making sure to check your dogs for fleas/ticks regularly, a small bit of garlic and brewer's yeast in their food, and D.E. dust baths if needed.  But I wouldn't say it's the ultimate answer for everyone! Some people live in areas with some pretty gnarly parasites."
youtubehaiku,3dmejk,Fimbultyr,3,Fri Jul 17 19:51:02 2015 UTC,"We use a seresto collar. We switched to Frontline for a couple months because it was cheaper, but in that time he picked up probably about a dozen ticks, one of which even attached itself. Switched back to the collar, haven't even found one on him since, and that's with him going on runs through meadows of tall grass."

youtubehaiku,3dir22,WEINER_SCHLAP,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:42:55 2015 UTC,"He is just a kid, probably doesn't even realise that his covers are shit.  As much as I hate what he did to 'Juicy' by completely destroying the whole point and message of the song, you can't really hate the kid for doing 'clean' covers of songs considering his producers probably make him do that stuff.  Remember that since he's really young, he'll probably either grow out of this or just mature up a bit as he gets older and pursue a proper career in hip-hop."

I did some light detective work for five minutes, and found some evidence:  He's using his real name for his youtube channel; it's connected to his Google + and Facebook accounts, and I found this (publicly visible) image of him. (never mind my dark Facebook CSS). Note that it's the same person as in the video.  Also, there's another, serious, documentary uploaded by him, about a sports coach in his area, that seems to have been created by him. The camera techniques are similar between these two videos.  I think the fact that we're even suspecting that it's cobbled together from bits of a real ""don't text and drive"" video, mixed with some random goofy selfie video, is a testament to her perfect delivery. I clicked on this like from the front page and didn't see that it was posted to this sub, so she had me fooled, which of course made the punchline even more effective."

youtubehaiku,3d6czw,schmak2010,11,Mon Jul 13 23:53:43 2015 UTC,"no, im pretty sure this one existed recently and wasn't another species.  i mean sure there is those old megafauna crocs that aren't around but they looked much bigger if their skeletons are anything to go by.  EDIT: A healthy adult male saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is typically 4.8‚Äì7 m long and weighs around 770 kg(1,694 lb), with many being much larger than this.[2] The female is much smaller, with typical body lengths of 2.5‚Äì3 m. An 8.5 m saltwater crocodile was reportedly shot on the Norman River of Queensland in 1957; a cast was made of it and is on display as a popular tourist attraction. However, due to the lack of solid evidence (other than the plaster) and the length of time since the crocodile was caught, it is not considered ""official"".[clarification needed] The saltwater crocodile has fewer armour plates on its neck than other crocodilians. Its body is broader as well, leading to early assumption that it was an alligator. The saltwater crocodile is the largest extant animal native to Australia that spends any portion of its time on land.  from here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_megafauna  the culprit itself.  Edit2: Further down i found this  Quinkana sp., was a terrestrial crocodile that grew from five to possibly 7 metres in length. It had long legs positioned underneath its body, and chased down mammals, birds and other reptiles for food. Its teeth were blade-like for cutting rather than pointed for gripping as with water dwelling crocodiles. It belonged to the mekosuchine subfamily (all now extinct). It was discovered at Bluff Downs in Queensland.  so there is a species of extinct huge crocs that the recent one just happened to rival in size.  Just in another note: Dromornis stirtoni, (Stirton's thunder bird, Miocene epoch) was a flightless bird three metres tall that weighed about 500 kilograms. It is one of the largest birds so far discovered. It inhabited subtropical open woodlands and may have been carnivorous. It was heavier than the moa and taller than Aepyornis.   jesus christ, how horrifying. being an 8 meter crocodile wouldn't help too much if there was demonic emus that were 3 meters tall hanging around."

It arguably makes the car worse at driving, but the stance culture is pretty funny, which is where the humor in this video comes from. They weren't serious. Here is a video that's kind of similar where the guy makes fun of stancing. When the other dude yelled ""stance nation"" this is what he was referencing.

They're tempting because hey, no smoke!   Imagine having alcohol, but the effects don't kick in for an hour or more and then last for 8 hours. Very easy to have a little too much and then feel like death for 8 hours."

By adding the time tag to the end of the youtube link, you can fast-forward the start of the video to shorten the length. For example, &t=16s at the end of the link queues the video to start at the 16 seconds mark.   https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubehaiku/comments/volz1/new_rules_you_asked_for_them_and_here_they_are/"

youtubehaiku,3cz6l6,waflerofle,8,Sun Jul 12 09:49:55 2015 UTC,I think if its only 2 seconds over it should be fine   We have discussed this before. The definite cutoff needs to be somewhere. If we allow just 2 seconds over that just means that we changed the rules from 30 to 32 seconds. It's just simpler to stick to the cutoff of 30 no exceptions. Otherwise you have the same problem again as soon as someone comes here with a 33 second submission.

youtubehaiku,3cz6l6,waflerofle,5,Sun Jul 12 09:48:34 2015 UTC,"But those rules are already established. This subreddit is specifically for short videos.  It's not about those 2 seconds, nobody said that. It about the fact that if you move the goalpost soon the next discussion will start, ""if we allow 30+x seconds why shouldn't we also allow 30+x+1 or 30+x+2"" it doesn't matter what x is. As soon as you define it you will create the same problem again just instead of around the 30 mark it will now be at the higher new mark.  Allowing up to x seconds over the mark solves nothing."

He was trying to think of the most extreme way to insult these people, and unfortunately race was the first thing to come to mind. Especially because in this generation, every-fucking-thing is considered racist, sexist, or hate speech. Of all the celebrity fuck ups out there, I think this is one of the most minimal. He verbally lashed out and apologized, yet drug addicts, wife beaters, violent drunks all remain their fame with no one to care."

Races typically take place in the autumn and winter (the international or ""World Cup"" season is October‚ÄìFebruary), and consist of many laps of a short (2.5‚Äì3.5¬† km or 1.5‚Äì2¬† mile) course featuring pavement, wooded trails, grass, steep hills and obstacles requiring the rider to quickly dismount, carry the bike while navigating the obstruction and remount.   Races for senior categories are generally between 30 minutes and an hour long, with the distance varying depending on the ground conditions. The sport is strongest in the traditional road cycling countries such as Belgium (Flanders in particular), France and the Netherlands.

Records, however, have more ""warmth"", and just sound more ""real"", at least in my opinion. There's not one that really sounds better than the other, just choose whichever you prefer."
youtubehaiku,3ct0vz,Xunderground,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:44:39 2015 UTC,No they don't.
youtubehaiku,3ct0vz,touche112,0,Sat Jul 11 07:52:26 2015 UTC,"They do, though. When they're new, at least. Like he said, once they're run down they don't sound as good."
youtubehaiku,3ct0vz,touche112,2,Fri Jul 10 23:50:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry you're getting downvoted, but he's correct that CD's have a higher dynamic range than Vinyls. So given proper audio playback equipment, a CD should out perform a Vinyl record in every aspect."
youtubehaiku,3ct0vz,marcm6246,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:52:00 2015 UTC,They only sound better because they're usually mastered better due to vinyls limitations. A record that is too hot will cause the needle to jump.

youtubehaiku,3ct0vz,marcm6246,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:17:40 2015 UTC,How does that work? How can older cars recognize an iPod plugged in to a faux cassette?
youtubehaiku,3ct0vz,autowikibot,7,Fri Jul 10 19:56:47 2015 UTC,"A cassette player works by dragging magnetic tape across a magnetised coil called a playback head. This generates a signal that can then be amplified into sound.  The faux cassette contains what basically amounts to a record head- something that generates the magnetic fields that would usually be stored on the cassette. It takes its signal from a 3.5mm jack that can be driven by your phone, iPod, or discman.  Science!"

You would be driving down the road when suddenly you would hear click click click click click click from the car locking itself over and over again. The car had electric locks, but not automatic locks; which made for a somewhat bizarre issue.    My family took to calling it a ""lockergeist"" for a while. Then, it developed a habit of only doing this in the bad part of town. It was quickly renamed the ""anti-ghetto system""."

youtubehaiku,3crqr5,Zedyy,-1,Fri Jul 10 15:49:08 2015 UTC,"I personally don't feel it fits the spirit of the sub since it is scripted comedy and not incidental humor. If it was breaking rules I would have reported and moved on, instead of coming to the comments section to discuss. Thanks man."
youtubehaiku,3crqr5,coahman,2,Fri Jul 10 17:43:02 2015 UTC,The spirit is entertaining videos under 30 seconds long.
youtubehaiku,3crqr5,Zedyy,-4,Fri Jul 10 17:45:35 2015 UTC,"Obviously not quite, based on the ruleset you just barely posted. And I'm guessing you must be new here, since it seems like a lot of the newer users think the same way you do.  I personally side with the mods who originally created the sub and wish we could go back to what the subreddit was originally created for, personally.   On a personal note, I would really like to see more poetic videos, not just haha funny clips. I really miss seeing tons of strange and unintentionally poetic videos around 10 seconds or less. I think those are what initially attracted so many subscribers to this group.   - /u/capnjack78 [M]  And from the same rules page:   Scripted comedy (TV shows and movies, specifically) are no longer allowed. Scripted comedy seems to be largely frowned upon as of late. The original idea behind this sub was to have poetic videos. Clips from The Simpsons and Community, etc. aren't really in line with the theory behind Youtube Haiku. I love Simpsons videos, as many of us do, and I know some of you poets will be upset about this, but I think by adding this rule it will only make this subreddit better. This doesn't mean funny videos are no longer allowed, and short Youtube comedy clips may still be allowed unless they're overwhelmingly reported and negatively commented by the community. The number of scripted comedy clips has really dropped in the past 7 days anyway, so hopefully it won't be a big deal. Edit 11/21: We're changing this to ""No scripted movie/tv videos allowed.""   So yeah, allowed for now since not enough users care about them. But they weren't in line with the spirit of the sub when it was created."

It is complete silence and the musical experience comes from the realization that you cannot perceive such a short sound no matter how hard you try and that it doesn't actually matter if a sound was played or not. In fact, the very ideas of what ""sound"" means would break down on this time scale as the interaction between air molecules required for sound to exist wouldn't be possible in this time frame."

""You Suffer"" is a 4 second song that they made. The guitarist at the time, Justin Broadrick, later stated that they made that song as a joke, but these days it's pretty common to see grindcore band playing stupid short songs, not getting that it's pretty much beating a dead horse anymore."

VR is 3D 360 video and I haven't even seen any of that yet for porn (probably my failing?). I have seen some rendered scenes of 3D models you can walk around and look at, but it's non-animated.  There's also things like the Miku Miku Dance anime stuff. I'm not sure if that qualifies as porn, let alone as porn for you, but there it is.  I don't doubt that VR porn will be huge however."
youtubehaiku,3cluhi,copperlight,10,Thu Jul 9 02:51:48 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Misread your last sentence - I'm dumb. Points still stand though.  I'm going to have to disagree - there's already some promising stuff, and with major porn sites starting to get involved, (Naughty America just recently) innovations and more ""realistic"" experiences are coming.  As of now, I'd say it's an advancement from traditional 2d/3d porn, but not by much. VirtualRealPorn and NaughtyAmerica's videos are 3D and more ""immersive"" than just split screen 3D porn, but still have issues, especially with current hardware (screens are too low resolution to really ""get"" it).  Here's a breakdown of what I think of Virtual Reality porn, from best experiences to worst:  Japanese H-games (Custom Maid 3D, PLAYGIRLS, etc.) - while very ""anime girl"" at heart, these are the most featured and polished experiences so far, despite some jankiness in setting up VR.  Virtual Reality oriented videos (Virtual Real Porn/Gay, Naughty America VR) - Made for VR, these are the beginnings of what I expect major porn companies to do with VR. Essentially a half dome of vision with 3d porn, it can be very immersive but still struggles  VRGirlz - Specific site, sells a set of poses scanned of real models, causing extremely life like computer models. Acts a sort of ""magazine"" where the models do not move, but some animations/LEAP integration is coming soon. Very realistic looking, not very immersive due to lack of animations currently.  Indie MMD/Unity/Unreal Experiences - Usually a looping animation with a nude model (be it an Miku Miku Dance one or a DAZ 3D one). Can be fairly immersive but usually relatively featureless and bland past the first time.  360 Video - While not technically VR, it works well in the medium. Not very immersive due to lack of depth, but can be interesting looking around the entire scene.  All of the experiences I've seen I found on /r/oculusnsfw, but there's another for Cardboard users (/r/CardboardNSFW I think?). I think the biggest tell that VR porn is going somewhere is the big names starting to acknowledge it. Especially now with Naughty America. We'll see as the tech progresses, but porn has always been a major tech ""advancer."""
youtubehaiku,3cluhi,dotpron,2,Thu Jul 9 03:49:30 2015 UTC,Same here. Been a frequent-ish VR user for about two years now. (Since early Oculus DK1 days. Only used DK1 and DK2 which I own both of). I can probably talk forever about VR.

youtubehaiku,3cluhi,jenbanim,11,Thu Jul 9 01:47:32 2015 UTC,"Flight sims are amazing, Flyinside (for Flight Sim X) and DCS both have Rift support. Flyinside is some of the best Rift implementation I've ever used and is just too much fun. The immersion is great for the Reno Air Race and any proximity flying. Helicopters... oh god yes.   Elite is also a ton of fun.    Racing games work very, very well when done right. The sense of speed and depth perception work fantastically.    However many other genres have hit hiccups, movement (like in Half Life 2's support) feels weird, the sudden 0-100 movement speed gives you a little motion sickness that does take a week or two to get used to. And looking with the mouse AND the Rift just doesn't work, deadzones need to be introduced (That's why the Vive has the motion tracked controllers, the Rift will ship with an xbox pad and later have the Oculus Touch. Elimination the mouse from gameplay is a big deal).    Also check out the new Rift puzzle games like I Expect You To Die. Solving James Bond-y puzzles in the Rift is damn fun."

youtubehaiku,3cluhi,Peregrine7,8,Thu Jul 9 15:01:14 2015 UTC,"Which product?   Oculus Rift DK2   What games or genres do you see benefiting most from VR?   This is a BIG question.   Any unexpected difficulties or limitations?   And this one is related to it. A big chunk of the future of VR is dependant on genre, and how genres will in turn adapt to the new medium. ¬†  A lot of that has to do with motion sickness. I consider myself a person of moderate susceptibility to motion sickness. I start to feel nauseous in a car if I'm focused on looking at something other than the road, like reading a book (my eyes tell my brain that I'm stationary but my inner ear says that I'm in motion) but I don't get sick from normal games on a 2D traditional monitor like one of my friends does (your eyes tell your brain you're in motion but your inner ear says you're stationary).    ¬†  First the bad news:  ¬†  I have NOT had good experiences with FPS games. I've tried a few, including Halflife 2 in VR, but the motion makes me feel sick. Developers are working on solutions to this, but don't expect any miracles. FPSes in VR will NOT be like the current experience unless you have an iron stomach. Again, this won't be the case for everyone, but don't expect the standard mainstream AAA FPS game to be a thing in VR as it currently is simply because it won't work for a big share of the market as is. They'll need to innovate new ways to move. I can explain some of the ways developers are looking in to this if interested.  And then there's the cost. Keep in mind that the Consumer Version of the Rift will have a resolution of 2160√ó1200 and 90hz. That means, ideally, you need a PC that can drive 3D graphics at this resolution at 90fps. There are ways to help with this including the standard reducing quality of your effects, and some magical tricks like 'timewarping' to interpolate frames where none have been rendered in time by the GPU. As always, we can expect newer video cards to perform better so this will become less of an issue. The fact is we're finally able to render VR graphics at an acceptable resolution, framerate, and quality, to make it viable.  ¬†  The good news:  ¬†  Everything else has been pretty great. Simulators are coming back. Anything with a cockpit I do not have much or any problems with. Elite Dangerous, flight sims, Assetto Corsa, Project Cars, and Dirt Rally have been great (glitches in software support have been an issue in some of these, but that's not going to impact the future of these games, let alone VR). Dirt Rally makes me a bit nauseous after a race or two but who wouldn't be after swinging a high performance vehicle around a a world rally track? God forbid I even love Euro Truck Simulator 2. It actually feels like you're sitting in a big rig truck driving around in it. Elite Dangerous actually feels like I have my own god damn space ship. It's hard to escape the illusion once you're in it, and it's an impossible experience to describe until you try it.  Third-person games will be fine with a little work on how the camera tracks the player. Think Super Mario 64-style cameras vs hard-locked to the player's character. Lucky's Tale is going to be a launch title for the Rift and will be comfortable for most people.  Platformers are good. A 3D platformerish game like Legend of Dungeon looks great. Like you're looking in to a miniature world and controlling someone inside of it. You can just imagine how good a MOBA would be, given that you can just glance around to observe the battlefield.  ¬†  ¬†  Other difficulties and limitations aside from motion sickness? Well the fact that you have to strap a screen to your face is the obvious one. Oculus says the latest one is almost as comfortable as putting on and wearing a baseball cap. I'm liable to believe them, but even so you can't sit down on the couch with your friends and let everyone else enjoy the same experience. At best they will either see the rendered output of what you're seeing on a 2D screen (which isn't much worse than it normally is), or they'll have some HMDs to put on as well to share the experience with you.  Let me conclude this that I've been playing video games for my entire life. That includes Colecovision, Commodore 64, Mac classics, Amigas, early PCs, Nintendo, SNES, the birth of 3D FPSes like Doom and Quake and onward. I remember 3D gaming becoming a thing and playing VirtuaRacer in the arcade for the first time and being blown away, but nothing so far has made my jaw drop as much as VR. You really need to experience good-quality VR to understand it. I think both Valve and Oculus are pushing for good VR experiences."

youtubehaiku,3cluhi,applejak,2,Thu Jul 9 05:45:56 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to believe that it is not animated for a few reasons, but primarily because this isn't a see-through screen. This is video being recorded by Leap Motion's new prototype sensor and then re-drawn in the HMD. Since you're just seeing the output video and NOT his real-time hand motions it is of course going to look 'tight'; the video could in fact be lagging behind his real-world hand motions.  Since he's said it's written in C++/OpenGL and uses Win32 calls I'm inclined to believe the video is real and not pre-rendered, but that doesn't mean there isn't lag behind his real-world motions and what's drawn on the screen. (Leap Motion isn't terrible for latency, but it's not fantastic either. I expect this new prototype is probably a lot better, so there's that as well)."

youtubehaiku,3cluhi,teuast,4,Thu Jul 9 06:23:51 2015 UTC,You'll need a pretty expensive rig to run VR comfortably. Right now only enthusiasts will be willing to spend that much cash.
youtubehaiku,3cluhi,arup02,2,Thu Jul 9 02:46:23 2015 UTC,"Yes/no. The very fact that the GearVR exists and runs off of a phone is counterpoint to what you're saying. It's really entirely up to the software you'll be running.  Even with a moderate rig there are still experiences like VR movie theatres, chat spaces, and low-poly games you could be playing on your PC with little difficulty and there's no doubt a lot of the 'mobile' games will be ported to the PC for use in VR also.  That said, Oculus has stated a target system with a GeForce 970, so you can expect that as a minimum for 'AAA' Oculus launch titles with decent graphics.  For something like Elite: Dangerous with the graphics cranked up? You're going to want more than a 970... my 290x can't even do the 75 fps needed for the DK2 with higher-end settings. If I want to run it at 90 fps at an even higher resolution they're really going to need to optimize the drivers, both for the Rift and for the GPU (both of which are happening, thankfully), or I'm going to be looking at either another new GPU or just turning down the quality settings."

So neither side can ever lose their own money, and even in a case like this the defendant probably walked away with a few hundred bucks left over.

youtubehaiku,3c9zwh,lifejustice,9,Mon Jul 6 16:29:24 2015 UTC,"My Norm Macdonald story:  I was excited to see him live.  We got tickets to The Parlour live in Bellevue, WA.  It was a pretty hefty financial investment for the trip, (babysitting for weekend, hotel...in bellevue, long drive) but hey...It's Norm Fucking MacDonald!  How often does that happen?  The openers were awesome.  Audience was lively, fun, and in a great mood.  Norm fucking blew.  It was God awful.  Couldn't stand straight, kept fidgeting with his cigarette and putting it in his mouth backwards.  He was clearly smashed and was incoherent.  Not a fucking joke was told.  He would bring up a recent event and then remark on it with no punchlines or any hint of wit or timing.  For the first 15 minutes, the audience sat in anticipation and thought it was a schtick.  Nope.  The dude was as entertaining as my alcoholic father.  It was very clear that he had zero material prepared and the audience was the punchline to his own joke.    He kept saying over and over, ""Don't worry, the show will start a little later."" ... "" What do you want to talk about?""  People would suggest something and he would just dismiss it while trying to keep his drunk-ass from falling over.  He was even talking about the death penalty.  Not outlined in a joke or a setup...just talking about it.  It was the quietest, most akward situation I've ever been in.  It wasn't even worth heckling or starting something.  It was pretty fucking depressing.  The kind of depressing where you can only imagine him crying and pissing himself in his hotel later.  Groups of people walked out (us included).  There was Zero norm macdonald in the show.    Considering the money that we had to put into that trip...Norm MacDonald was a fucking mistake.  I can't find any respect for him any more.  If you want to see a washed-up old man stand in a stupor and try to piece thoughts together, this might be the show for you.  Edited to add:  I believe this was in May of 2014.  I don't remember for certain....but that time frame seems about right."
youtubehaiku,3c9zwh,thepancakebreakfast,4,Mon Jul 6 13:11:13 2015 UTC,"I saw him in December of 2014. (the early show) He was on stage for one hour and about 40 minutes. Most comics typically do about 50m-1hr15m. He was incredible. Both me and the people around me were crying laughing. My face hurt. Best comedy show I've ever seen by far and I've seen several great comics.  so your experience, at least in my opinion, was the exception rather than the rule."

Also you will have trailers that try a different approach just to encapsulate whats unique about the game or for the shockvalue. If a new style of trailer catches on in the public others will follow with a similar trailer.   Commercials are very similar like these trailers. You can make a sketch about how stupid the current commercials are. But you know atleast one or two companies that make copmpletely different commercials and you like those commercials because its so different from the rest and its a well made commercial."

youtubehaiku,3c3wor,w3sticles,16,Sun Jul 5 00:18:59 2015 UTC,wolf was a pretty good album. I havent listened to goblin or bastard since arounf the time they were released. I'm not sure how they'll have aged.
youtubehaiku,3c3wor,Xomz,16,Sun Jul 5 00:21:17 2015 UTC,"Wolf was a fantastic album in my opinion, and I'm not a huge fan of Goblin. Bastard was better than Goblin hands down, but the jazzy production, clever wordplay and often emotional content on Wolf makes it one of my favorites, even if Tyler isn't admittedly very technical with his rapping."

youtubehaiku,3c3wor,MrJDMTyte,-1,Sat Jul 4 19:06:41 2015 UTC,Because it's at such a higher level than anything else he's done. And his new album is a direction that doesn't Suit him at all and he's said he doesn't want to do the same sort of music he did on wolf and before that

Also listen to some of his lyrics, it's not always shit like this. He talks about his dad a lot, and about how he's perceived due to stereotypes. I don't think I've ever seen him be serious in an interview, anyway."
youtubehaiku,3c3wor,octopop,13,Sat Jul 4 18:08:32 2015 UTC,"What's really funny, is that you taking all of his songs so seriously is what he doesn't understand. Basically, he's said in an interview that he sees music as another medium to tell stories like movies, books etc. And why is it not okay to talk about dark thoughts in song? Interview: https://youtu.be/-OoZNENl0Cg"
youtubehaiku,3c3wor,nuzzot,18,Sat Jul 4 16:43:58 2015 UTC,He literally stops before one of his songs to say not to take it seriously and that it's fiction. Which is so stupid that he had to actually explain that to dense motherfuckers that don't understand what that means

youtubehaiku,3c3wor,nuzzot,13,Sun Jul 5 18:26:00 2015 UTC,What I don't get is Eminem and Tyler are really similar: they both have alter egos and talk about some pretty racy things but only Tyler really bothers people. I get that Em has been around for a while but..come on people.
youtubehaiku,3c3wor,TeamNinja,3,Sat Jul 4 17:00:27 2015 UTC,"It's so people can feed a lot of their subtle racism about the ""thug"" mentality. And I know people will think I'm being social justice-y but you know the people who say ""well if blacks would just pull up their pants and stop listening to that gangster rap they could be something"". When people like tyler or kanye west do something bad, there is always threads where the comments allows these people to feed those thoughts and circlejerk the anger"
youtubehaiku,3c3wor,Nixnilnihil,2,Sat Jul 4 18:59:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think race is that big of a motive I think mostly it has to do with the artist's personas being abrasive, whereas they might not be in private. Artists like Tyler the Creator and Kanye get a TON of publicity because they continue to go against the grain and cause problems, but I've heard nothing but positive things from people who have met them both personally. I think Eminem has simmered down I guess since his days as Slim Shady so maybe it's just the same as it was when Eminem started rapping about some pretty graphic stuff."
youtubehaiku,3c3wor,nuzzot,2,Sat Jul 4 20:44:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah ill agree its not true for everyone but for the people who do have that prejudice I feel it is that way for them. Same with the bitter guys on reddit that are like ""women are all whores"" and stuff. I say it also as someone who's felt that way before and bandwagon hated somebody in the past. Either way they'll live on and people will just keep getting mad. Which is fine too, I just wish more people realized the effect certain online communities can have on your perception and opinion."

Because the same amount of gain is applied across the given range, the signal-to-noise ratio and relative dynamics are generally unchanged. Normalization differs from dynamic range compression, which applies varying levels of gain over a recording to fit the level within a minimum and maximum range. Normalization is one of the functions commonly provided by a digital audio workstation.     Relevant: Centralizer and normalizer | MP3Gain | Mp3DirectCut   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

youtubehaiku,3btj3q,EvrythingISayIsRight,3,Thu Jul 2 17:18:25 2015 UTC,"Your last point is most likely the explanation. Many traditional republicans will benefit from his radical stance on issues, being able to drive the narrative towards less important issues for which they have focus-group tested, moderately crafted responses.  As for his poll success, it is likely that those keeping him relevant are those mainly sick of the typical political rhetoric from other candidates, plus the American voters are, as a whole, willfully ill-informed.  Trump is serving his purpose right now - he knows that he cannot win but might get some political favors by insulting particular candidates, throwing them softball debate issues and playing the crazy republican card."
youtubehaiku,3btj3q,Smokey651,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:21:54 2015 UTC,"The only people I know irl that support him are those that are sick of what they call 'career politicians'.

See: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decade_(Japan)   ""The Lost Decade"" or ""the Lost 10 Years"" is the time after the Japanese asset price bubble's collapse within the Japanese economy. The term originally referred to the years from 1991 to 2000, but recently the decade from 2001 to 2010 is often included, so that the whole period of the 1990s to the present is referred to as the Lost Two Decades or the Lost 20 Years.

But don't worry, the cat didn't actually harm it (as far as we are aware).   What's interesting about leopard geckos is their primary defense mechanism is detaching their tails, and basically letting the predator eat it so they can escape. But this is usually only in fat-tailed leopard gecko, and works more effectively because their tails look vastly different from their bodies (as seen here: http://i.imgur.com/Cqr9ECw.jpg). The tails usually take a couple weeks to grow back, or more than that, it really depends on the gecko.  And yes, the gecko in the video is 100% fine :)"

youtubehaiku,3brt3y,hobnobbinbobthegob,10,Wed Jul 1 21:09:49 2015 UTC,"Yes.    Ratts Tyerell was a male Aleena born on his species' homeworld of Aleen Minor sometime during the waning days of the Galactic Republic. Tyerell grew up in a harsh environment, causing him to push his reflexes to the limit‚Äîas a youth, he was frequently chased by the vicious creatures of his homeworld. As a result of this difficult life, Aleena had extremely quick reflexes as a species, which led many of them to success on the Podracing circuits. Tyerell, too, showed a natural aptitude for Podracing, and before long, he became a regular racer on the worlds where the sport was held.  Tyerell eventually acquired a large podracer from the Important Merchant to make up for his lack of height. Named after the scatalpen, a deadly predator native to Tyerell's homeworld, the Titan 1250 Scatalpen was very fast, though its acceleration and maneuverability were not as advanced. Still, it served the Aleena racer well, and for several years, he slowly built up his reputation, becoming the track favorite at Howler Gorge and earning the respect and friendship of his fellow racers. Tyerell was a gentleman on the track, though off of it he was thought by many to be very boastful and even a bully. Some time during his career, he found a mate, and together they had several children, including Deland and Djulla Tyerell.  Tyerell was also fond of a game called Ratts Race and often played it with spacers. The Aleena was also against any form of cheating at races, and was sickened at how Sebulba, one of the most successful podracers of the period, had achieved his success. Tyerell sought to kill Sebulba, although he was not the only racer who wanted to be rid of the Dug. Still, he never conspired with the others, preferring to keep his ""gentleman"" reputation intact. Instead, he had an outlaw tech specialist fit the Scatalpen with illegal weaponry, hoping to ambush Sebulba during 32 BBY's Boonta Eve Classic on Tatooine, and to win the race for himself.  The Boonta Eve Classic was one of the most prestigious annual podraces in the galaxy; it attracted huge crowds at the Mos Espa Grand Arena on Tatooine. The race was always the subject of much gambling and cheating, and nearly all of the other racers were involved in plots with each other, hoping to snatch first place. Tyerell had plans to ridding himself of Sebulba, but he worked toward this goal alone. He lined up in his podracer in the first row of the starting grid, alongside fellow racers Aldar Beedo, Mawhonic, and his target, Sebulba. The race also saw the inclusion of Anakin Skywalker, a young slave who had entered the Boonta Eve Classic despite mass ridicule directed at him by the other players.  Tyerell's wife had recently given birth to another child, named Doby Tyerell, but attended the race anyway along with her three other younglings. Tyerell did manage to complete one lap, though he had not yet been presented with an opportunity to take out Sebulba, who was far ahead. The Aleena's race, however, was cut short on his second lap, in the Laguna Cave‚Äîa tight cavern full of massive stalactites. Worried that young Anakin Skywalker would overtake him, Tyerell lost concentration as he passed through the cave; meanwhile, his accelerator jammed and he was unable to gain clearance past the rocky stalactites. Tyerell's vehicle collided with a large rock and he died in the explosion that ensued. Even if he had survived the explosion, he had no chance of expecting help from anyone, as the Laguna Cave was rumored to contain a Krayt dragon.  Tyerell's family was devastated after his death, though it marked only the beginning of troubles to follow. Ratts Tyerell's own brother sold his daughter, Djulla, as a slave to Sebulba. His son, Deland‚Äîunder the nickname ""Pabs""‚Äîintended to race Sebulba for his sister's freedom on the planet Euceron. However, Sebulba was not the one racing; rather, it was the Dug's son Hekula. Meanwhile, Sebulba sabotaged the young Aleena, ruining his chances of winning. Anakin Skywalker, who had won the Boonta Eve Classic wherein Tyerell perished, had since become a Jedi, and was on the planet to act as a peacekeeper. Unable to resist the temptation of podracing, he raced against Hekula. Skywalker raced in Deland's place and beat Hekula, winning Djulla's freedom.  Ratts Tyerell's death ultimately had a large effect on the sport of podracing. Moved by his father's death, Deland Tyerell eventually established the Ratts Tyerell Foundation, which was an organization devoted to making Podracing a safer sport in order to preserve the lives of those pilots who had wives and children. They campaigned for the sport to be outlawed all over the galaxy and were successful on many worlds, though several famous podracers spoke out against it, claiming it was an effort by the Republic to crack down on non-Human activities. The Republic denied this, and Sate Pestage, advisor to the Supreme Chancellor, made a statement declaring that it was nonsense.   http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ratts_Tyerell"

youtubehaiku,3bobck,digdog303,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:01:55 2015 UTC,"Party horn:       A party horn is a horn formed from a paper tube, often one that is flattened and rolled into a coil, and which unrolls when blown into, producing a horn-like noise. The item is not known consistently by any term in English, also being known by a number of local variations, neologisms, and individual terms, often containing variants and synonyms of blowing (puffing, blow-out etc.) and noise (whistle, squeak etc.)  Modern variations have a plastic mouthpiece, which prevents the swift degradation of the device from exposure to the moisture of the mouth. Often the paper tube contains a coiled up metal or plastic strip that rapidly retracts the horn when you stop blowing on it. Others have a brightly colored feather attached to the end which vibrates in the outgoing air flow as the horn is blown.  Some people distinguish between different types and are quite specific with the various type:   party horn, tweeter, squeaker, noisemaker - shaped like a horn, makes some sort of a tooting noise paper tongue, party proboscis, blow-out, blow tickler, squiggly flappy horn - does not make a tooting noise, unrolls when one blows into it, often used to try to hit fellow party-goers in the face [citation needed] noisemaker - usually made out of tin, a small box with a handle on it, when spun around it makes a clicking noise clapper - has two parts on it, usually the same shape, when waved back and forth, makes a clapping noise     Image i - A party horn.

Players do actually take these major tournaments seriously, there are thousands of dollars on the line, and I believe Dave Feldberg (used his last name, happy now?) most likely won some cash for hitting that hole in one, so he was probably pretty amped up about that.

youtubehaiku,3bjo9h,bakester14,14,Tue Jun 30 00:33:34 2015 UTC,Reminds me of the more extreme version of that idea with the kid who pours soda into a cup and then it falls up to the ceiling
youtubehaiku,3bjo9h,creepyeyes,2,Tue Jun 30 00:48:36 2015 UTC,Wut?
youtubehaiku,3bjo9h,I_HaveAHat,4,Tue Jun 30 15:49:19 2015 UTC,"I can't for the life of me find it, but it was the same principle as what's happening in this video. Basically a kid walks into the room and sits down at a table with a cup and a bottle of soda. He then opens the soda, and all of the contents of the bottle fall up to the ceiling. In reality, it was a fake room that rotated 180 degrees after he sat down (I guess he was strapped to the chair somehow?) but because the camera was oriented with the room, we as the viewers didn't see the rotation happen."

youtubehaiku,3bjo9h,StickmanPirate,18,Tue Jun 30 00:22:13 2015 UTC,Maybe he just bought it. Then the sides would be too soft and the middle would be perfect.
