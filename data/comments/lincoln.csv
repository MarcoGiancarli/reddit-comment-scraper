They are having trouble filling those apartments for a reason. (One's moldy, one's infested, one is permeated with cigarette smoke, one has a nightmare of a manager who nickles and dimes absolutely everyone, etc.)  We absolutely lucked out this year and scored the unicorn that is the good house rental, but prior to finding that opportunity, our top pick was Highpointe on Old Cheney just off of 48th. An older but well-maintained facility with nice staff and way more compliments online than complaints (and most complaints are more than five years old.) As far as we can tell we would have been pretty content there."

I had a 1BR at $740/mo, so a 2BR/2Bath might be at the tippy top of your budget. But it's in a super convenient location AND in a quiet neighborhood. Also, Bagels & Joe within walking distance.

The apartments are 820 a month including cable, and are pretty large. 2 bed 2 bath, allow pets with a payment of course. Otherwise I haven't had a complaint, if something is broke it's a few short hours before they are there and it's fixed and they are gone again. Apartments are nice, no smell, and no issues, they renovate everytime a family moves out. Been here a year now and they threw in a free carpet cleaning and dropped our rent by almost 45 dollars after re-leasing.

Its still not super cheap but the channel packages seem to be better organized and they run it over the net so its not an actual cable connection. That being said I'm in Airpark and the Internet is occasionally spotty and when it ks you can't seem to both stream netflix AND download a pc game via steam or something on the connection without netflix having issues. This could be their proprietary wireless router however. For the most part though everything has a decent signal strength and the current streaming use has been fine with windstream. By packaging it with kinetic we got it for like 30 more a month than we were paying before.

Called their support and they sent a technician out who replaced the modem but it didn't help. They did this two other times and nothing ever improved. Fortunately I was able to move to time warner about a year ago. I have the 20 down package and I'm consistently speed testing around 20-25.

You could go north on 84th and west on the mopac, or you could cut west through your neighborhood to Holmes park and take the Billy Wolf trail downtown. The trails actually wrap right around the backside of the stadium.  If you're worried about the length just give it a try before the season starts, and see what you think.

Authorized emergency vehicles; privileges; conditions.  (1) Subject to the conditions stated in the Nebraska Rules of the Road, the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle, when responding to an emergency call, when pursuing an actual or suspected violator of the law, or when responding to but not when returning from a fire alarm, may:  (a) Stop, park, or stand, irrespective of the provisions of the rules, and disregard regulations governing direction of movement or turning in specified directions; and  (b) Except for wreckers towing disabled vehicles and highway maintenance vehicles and equipment:  (i) Proceed past a steady red indication, a flashing red indication, or a stop sign but only after slowing down as may be necessary for safe operation; and  (ii) Exceed the maximum speed limits so long as he or she does not endanger life, limb, or property.  (2) Except when operated as a police vehicle, the exemptions granted in subsection (1) of this section shall apply only when the driver of such vehicle, while in motion, sounds an audible signal by bell, siren, or exhaust whistle as may be reasonably necessary and when such vehicle is equipped with at least one lighted light displaying a red light visible under normal atmospheric conditions from a distance of five hundred feet to the front of such vehicle.  (3) The exemptions granted in subsection (1) of this section shall not relieve the driver from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons, nor shall such provisions protect such driver from the consequences of his or her reckless disregard for the safety of others.  (4) Authorized emergency vehicles operated by police and fire departments shall not be subject to the size and weight limitations of sections 60-6,288 to 60-6,290 and 60-6,294.  So that's state law, anyway. I'd read it to suggest that police can disregard ordinary traffic laws while responding to an emergency. I haven't found any local ordinances to the contrary, but I spent about a minute and a half on this.  EDIT: Why does (4) have a bigger font than the rest of this?"
lincoln,3dlpra,Rodd45,2,Fri Jul 17 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but I do see Lincoln city police offers tearing around town and on highways at ridiculous speeds without lights or sirens seemingly too frequently. One passed me on Hwy 34 the other night. They must have been going at least a buck ten cuz he passed me like I was standing still. (I was going 60.) No lights, no siren, and it was dark out. I didn't see them in my rearview mirror and it scared the living shit out of me when they passed me. They could have been out on a joyride for all I know. I think the LPD should be forced to follow the speed limits or at the very least use their lights/sirens to alert the public that they're driving aggressively.   Edit: matched pronouns"

lincoln,3djjve,pastabird,3,Fri Jul 17 03:13:29 2015 UTC,"First try everything under the sun not to get divorced, it fucking sucks. If the parties involved are not amicable to one another and emotions are overtaking logic, it's really tough to communicate. Which is when lawyering up pops in.  Lawyering up for divorce is what society wants you to believe you need to do in order for you to get outta your life contract you signed with someone. This is not true. I highly advise trying to stay as far away from lawyers if at all possible. It's so stupid to pay someone to be your middle man to communicate with someone you were planning on spending the rest of your life with. If there are children involved, lots of finances, and the removal of logical discussion between one another, then try mediation first.   The Mediation Center here in LNK is a low cost way for two people to get divorced, if you feel you need to have someone in the room with you to help negotiate. They provide low cost legal counsel, and help you through the process.  Mediation Center  610 J St # 100, Lincoln, NE 68508 (402) 441-5740  That being said it might not work... It didn't for me, because she was hell bent on an unfair child agreement. So I had to get a lawyer.  Darla Ideus at Baylor, Evnen, Curtiss, Grimit & Witt was great. My ex wife had Terry Poppe, IMO he's what you would imagine a divorce lawyer in the movies to be portrayed as. Darla was able to secure 50/50 joint custody with child support. As a single father, I was very happy with Darla, but I'm still paying off her bill three years later.  TL,DR: Try everything not to get divorced, lawyers for divorce are rip off. Try mediation first. Still think you need a lawyer be prepared to pay a lot. Darla Ideus at Baylor Evnen was awesome for this single dad.

My buddies back home have told me that Blue Bloods is total crap, Zip Line has one decent beer, Ploughshare isn't anything to write home about. I've had Modern Monks, Granite City, and Empyrean. MM and GC are pretty meh (though it's been years since I had them) Empyrean is still good. I try to buy some whenever I get back to western Nebraska. Though it's tasting more and more watered down. Which makes me sad.   I'm moving home from the NW. My friends have lived and been to the east and west coasts so I do (mostly) trust their opinions. So we'll see. But if it's anything like they say. I'm pretty sure I can make a few beers that will be good sellers there. (I'm a brewer by trade)   So what are you opinions? I like brutally honest details."
lincoln,3d7k4n,smgulz,3,Thu Jul 16 16:29:32 2015 UTC,"I assumed when you said 'solid' that all they brewery's offerings are without off flavors. Even though I don't like all styles, I will still call a beer solid if the fermentation is correct.   Well, this IS Nebraska, so I have low expectations out of the gate. It could be worse, we could be North Dakota.  That's all very interesting. I'm sure availability / repetition has a huge effect on each individual drinker's preferences. My take on it is...  Yes, Blue Blood is total crap, they've done a couple of okay short-run beers but I have all but cut all ties with them at this point. They are heavily funded, and are running a business first and foremost, not a brewery. They were contract brewing for Storz but they got replaced because all THAT beer had the same quality issues as their own beers do. They are also the pilot brewing system for their neighbors, American Beer Equipment, so whenever they bring in a potential client for a brewing system, they take them next door to look at the Blue Blood branded Cadillac of all systems. They've brought a few different young bucks through as assistant brewer, presumably trying to breathe life into it and fix some of the flavor issues... but overall.. jeez. I would pay money NOT to drink their beer. I will say, the new brewery project at the Robber's Cave site looks and sounds very interesting... what a way to draw in customers!! But it will take a REAL turnaround in beer quality to actually get me to return.  Zipline is by and large the most successful Lincoln brewery, I'm not sure why your buddies think they only have one decent beer. If you do not like Belgian yeast, you won't like them very much. They are gaining traction in other states' markets, too. I drink here often. I consider them 2nd best in Nebraska, only losing to NBC in first. Excellent altbier. Great oatmeal porter. Good seasonal and limited release beers. I can easily kill 4 hours in their taproom any time.  Ploughshare is, in fact, a great brewery IF you are into subtly nuanced beers which express their inherent yeast character well. They brew very tasty malty and balanced beers. You have to go in with the expectation of an English pub, NOT an American taproom. They are not Stone or Green Flash and they do not apologize for that fact. I've drank here extensively since they opened last year, and it's my go-to pub spot in Lincoln. Most comfortable taproom, for sure. Best ambiance. They HAD awesome food, and once they get their kitchen staffed again, they will continue to serve good eats. (Being their first full summer in business, they had to figure out the impact UNL students being on break would have on their levels, and plan accordingly... Working on it, though!)  Empyrean does what they do well - Package beer that sells very well on the shelf - but they have had consistency issues with Dark Side, which used to be my favorite. At this point, I drink their beer on tap during Happy Hour at Lazlo's Haymarket, or I buy bottles when it goes on sale for $5.99 at Hy-Vee, but otherwise, I will instead pick up Zipline or Nebraska Brewing Co., or I get a growler from Ploughshare.  Modern Monks are good guys, but they are hamstrung by their relationship with Misty's, who requires them to brew their core house beers first and foremost and does not encourage much freedom or creativity. They'll do a LOT better once they have their own space and own brewing system. Their briefly-lived canned beers were quite tasty, the Fox Hole Pivo is good, crisp and light, and the Autumn Bomb was smashingly good. I'm hoping they get back into canning soon, once they sort out a location.  Granite City is not a Lincoln brewery and I will not under any circumstances consider them one. Moving on.  Opening sometime in the next year will be some thingy at Grand Manse, I'm hearing some rumors that it's going to be a brewhouse showcase project for the other brew equipment manufacturer in town. Similar to Blue Blood's system, something to take the clients to see and show off all the bling. No idea if the beer will be quality.  There are at least a couple other projects in fledgling state which are not worth mentioning here quite yet, since they could easily flame out before ever taking any real form.  I'm of the opinion that Lincoln's population won't support more than 6 major brewpub/craft brew operations in town... so at this point, I'm hedging my bets and giving up my brewery plans. If I DO open anything, it'll either be a bottle shop or maybe a homebrew supply shop. Or, I'll look for a strategic small-town Nebraska destination which could support a small brewery.  Now... talking Omaha... Nebraska Brewing is certainly the king of the crop... I like Lucky Bucket alright enough, but don't feel compelled by their beer or their story. Farnam House is awesome, Scriptown LOOKS awesome and I gotta make it up to see them, and of course the Benson twins (Benson Brewery and Infusion Brewing) are fun to visit as well. I do not have any opinion of Upstream or Brickway."
lincoln,3d7k4n,PP_UP,2,Thu Jul 16 17:25:34 2015 UTC,"+100   This is spot on and much better put than my comment. Lincoln has been exciting for beer recently - at least given where it started.  Edit: The one thing I would add is that distribution has improved too. Stone, New Holland, and Founders just show up last summer. Having moved here from Michigan I did a little dance in HyVee when I saw Dragon's Milk again. Also there's this Oskar Blues people speak well of that I'm just getting around to trying."

lincoln,3d4n5o,pleatedmeat,2,Mon Jul 13 14:42:30 2015 UTC,"No not all. You need one to reserve a study room, but anyone can walk in and sit at the open tables to work."
lincoln,3d4n5o,Valchrist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:46:59 2015 UTC,Ok. Thank you very much. Just have to figure out the wireless access. :-)
lincoln,3d4n5o,r_u_dinkleberg,2,Mon Jul 13 14:49:33 2015 UTC,As far as I know (I graduated from UNL) you cannot access their wireless (or wired!) without being a registered computer. To do so you either need to be a current student or a currently faculty/staff worker.
lincoln,3d4n5o,r_u_dinkleberg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:11:31 2015 UTC,Ok. This is a very useful piece of information. I will check with them. Many universities have this requirement. Thank you.  EDIT -- I found this link on UNL's website (http://its.unl.edu/wifi/unl-guest-wireless). It appears that UNL does have a guest wireless. Not sure of the availability and connection quality at Love library.
lincoln,3d4n5o,TrashManJIm,2,Mon Jul 13 15:29:51 2015 UTC,"I'm over at East campus. They have guest wifi that you can register your device (for me its my phone, not sure about laptops) for like a week. After that you have to re-register it. Kind of inconvenient but hey, free wifi. I'm not a student, so its under the guest connections.   Otherwise if you're friends with someone who has access to UNL Air which is the main wifi, they can register your device and you shouldn't have any issues."

lincoln,3d1td2,st3f09,4,Sun Jul 12 21:40:19 2015 UTC,"I played there Friday, and right now, most holes are open. A couple of holes on the back 18 are still missing baskets, such as hole 11 and maybe 17. They just finished construction on the north half, where the back 18 is, so that part should be back to normal soon. They have even covered the dirt construction road with straw so no worries about that any more.  But, they will start work on the south half soon so the front nine will probably be out of commission for a bit. I think they will remove all baskets within the work area to discourage people from being in the work area with equipment running."
lincoln,3d1td2,ndpool,3,Sun Jul 12 21:27:44 2015 UTC,Went there today but didn't go to that section. My brother said they used the baskets for a tournament a week ago at Pioneers Park.
lincoln,3d2ost,prezcat,3,Mon Jul 13 01:18:11 2015 UTC,"Depends where in town you'll be living some apartment complexes have assigned parking, some have parking tags and if you don't have a tag you'll get towed and others don't have any parking restrictions.  If you're living anywhere other then downtown you'll probably be able to park on the street if the area has any available, but most of Lincoln doesn't have meters and the big thing is that you're supposed to move your vehicle once in a 24 hour period. If it's downtown you'll have meters and garages, the meters you don't have to plug after 6 (I think) and I think start back up at 6 or 8 and most garages now have first hour free."
lincoln,3d2ost,mrcookie623,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:35:15 2015 UTC,Thanks - I'll make sure that I get a tag from my complex.  :)
lincoln,3d2ost,r_u_dinkleberg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:44:22 2015 UTC,"""Where"" is the most crucial question.  Downtown is all metered and garages. Any of the residential neighborhoods (WITH a few exceptions, such as Near South and other populous, apartment-heavy areas) will have TONS of on street parallel parking available to you.  So it just depends where you are at.  As mrcookie said, it's 24 Hours limit for the on street parking, you must move the vehicle once a day or you'll get ticketed."

lincoln,3cz8gk,maquila,-5,Sun Jul 12 04:19:34 2015 UTC,That's honestly about it.  And they'll kick you out (at I think midnight?) if you don't have a parent/guardian with you.  That's because they're a restaurant before midnight and a 'bar' after midnight.   Its retarded.
lincoln,3cz8gk,Ender06,4,Sun Jul 12 20:32:52 2015 UTC,If they are following local rules they should kick you out after 9:00. Places like jakes don't card at the door so as long as you aren't being idiots you will likely get to stay all night.  I know brewskys in the haymarket will let anyone in unless you are going to the blazing pianos show. I also believe you can hang out in the rail yard as a minor. They don't card just to hang in the commons area. Not too many options out there unfortunately.

lincoln,3ckpar,cyclistduke,38,Wed Jul 8 17:43:35 2015 UTC,"Lincoln is a pretty fun city. I've had a lot of friends move away and then come back. I recently had a friend visit Portland and Seattle and mention how good we had it here, despite loving those two cities. I know I'm going to miss a ton of good stuff, but here's what I had in mind right away.  Nutshell: -O street is our major street, runs east to west -The streets that go north to south are numbered. The major EAST boundary is 84th and the major WEST boundary is 9th -The streets that go east to west are Letters and names. The alphabet is stuck right in the middle (a is further south than x, for example) -UNL (University of Nebraska-Lincoln is the big college that fuels this town) -We have VERY good public schools (Lincoln Public Schools) -Very safe, honestly. (South of downtown is kind of ""sketchy"" to some people, Everett neighborhood and between campuses on Holdrege (t-town). Take it or leave it. I kknow tons of people that live in those places and are fine. I go to houses in those areas all the time.  -HyVee is our big local grocery store  -We have this fantastic thing called Hear Nebraska. Keep up with music from it. www.hearnebraska.org -KZUM 89.3 is good, local radio; our local NPR is 91.1.   If you're into music, bikes, etc, you'll fit in just fine. Lincoln is very alternate lifestyle friendly, relatively speaking. It's the most ""liberal"" city in Nebraska besides Omaha. Good food, bike trails, fancy coffee, hipsters, vibrant music and art scenes, etc etc.   My favorite bike shops: -Cycle Works -Monkey Wrench Cycles -Recycled (used and vintage)  Good Music Venues: -The Zoo Bar (famous for blues, also host a lot of folk/country, rock, soul, etc) -Duffys (lots of everything plays here) -The Bourbon (where the best ""bigger"" shows are, tons of genres, great bar) -Vega (still new, they've hosted some good bands) -Meadowlark (open mic and acoustic shows, coffee house) -Crescent Moon (open mic and acoustic shows, coffee house, beer, wine)  Non-douchey bars: -The Zoo Bar -O'Rourkes  -The Bourbon -Zen's -Barrymore's -The Other Room (speakeasy, very high quality) -Jake's (cigar bar)  Music Stores: -Dietze (locally owned, very good) -Music Go Round (assholes, but you can find good deals) -Roots Music Shop (downtown, can find some cool stuff once in a while)  Record Stores: -Lefty's (my fave-lots of good stuff, new and used; Les is great) -Backtrack (recently changed hands, they have a good selection but the owners dont know anything) -Recycled Sounds (Stuart, the owner, is a weirdo but he has a lot of good used stuff)  Art: -Tons of galleries downtown. On the first Friday of each month theres....First Friday! All the galleries are open and it's fun year-round.  Local Beer: -Zipline (one of the best) -Empyrean (Lincoln's oldest; basic and solid) -Ploughshare (good stuff, our newest) -Blueblood (crap)  Nebraska Beer not in Lincoln: -Spilker (good)  -Thunderhead (in Kearney, great) -Scratchtown (in Ord, causing people to talk)  Food I like: -Oso Burrito (like Chipolte or Qdoba but WAY better; they use fresh ingredients and have great stuff) -Lazlo's (the local staple; good beer (their own) and solid American food) -Sultan's Kite (best falafel/gyros/schwarma in town) -Maggie's (good vegetarian) -Hiro 88 (sushi; I know I know. Recently my buddy from California came and ate there with me and he said it was just fine compared to what he can get) -Bread & Cup (high quality) -JTK (one of the nicest and priciest places in Lincoln) -Amu Manu (good REAL ramen) -Yia Yias (BEST pizza in Lincoln; biggest beer selection in Nebraska) -El Chaparro (best real mexican food in Lincoln, NOT the one on 48th, the one near downtown) -Sebastian's Table (tapas, very good) -Honest Abe's (best hamburgers in Lincoln) -D'Leons (insane local, huge, cheap burritos and mexican; great when you're drunk or sober) -Hong Kong (cheap, fast, great Chinese) -Fireworks (sister restaurant to Lazlos; solid American) -Ivanna Cone (BEST ICE CREAM EVER PERIOD)  -Buzzard Billy's (creole/cajun) -Sips and Subs (breakfast and lunch only; like a small town cafe- great!)  Coffee (fair trade/organic, quality stuff): -Cultiva (highest quality in Lincoln, very serious coffee people) -Meadowlark (my go-to; very socially conscious, etc) -The Coffee House (good coffee and baked items, tea) -The Mill* (not fair trade, but a local staple, good people)  Bookstores: -Indigo Bridge (great for new books, very socially conscious; good coffee in it, too) -Blue Stem (used, local) -A Novel Idea (used, local) -Trade-a-Tape (only comic book store)  Woodworking stuff: -Hardwood Heaven (the local haunt for everyone I know into woodcraft)"

Some IS organic, but since we're not ""certified"" (meaning we haven't paid a bunch of money to get a stamp of approval), we're not allowed to label it as organic. We usually have 2-3 coffees in stock that ARE organic, but because they went through the same roaster as non-organic, we can't label them organic. Unless, you know...we pay thousands of dollars. Then we can :)"

As for Emperyean they make a consistent brew and have for years. I'm by no means going out to buy their beer but the occasional Third Stone is tolerable.

lincoln,3ckpar,Lord_Galahad,7,Sun Jul 12 11:36:51 2015 UTC,"Lincoln is an amazing city. If you enjoy biking, the city is lined with trails that connect almost every part of the city, making it super easy to bike downtown. The awesome part about Lincoln is that it is not too spread out. Most all of the concert venues are in the same place (14th and O st, or nearby there). The concert venues are all near bars too, so if you want to see a concert and then catch up with friends afterwards, it is really easy to do so.  Restaurants: Just my take on it... Check out Amu Manu Ramen Bar (absolutely fucking delicious, people rave about it and it's a pretty new place). For mediterranean, a new place opened up called Amsterdam Falafel and Kabob... Super tasty and affordable. Burgers - you can't go wrong in Lincoln. Honest Abe's is the top rated place in town, and there is also Dempsey's which has amazing burgers AND great craft irish coffees.  Venues: I'm a musician and I'm pretty partial to the Bourbon Theater. Awesome place to hang out and go to shows. Owner of the place is a badass and so are all the employees. Very, very nice people there. Zoo Bar has incredible blues music every night of the week. Can't go wrong with any of the music they have there. Duffy's has music most nights of the week and has a bit more of an indie side to it musically. All three of these venues are within a block of 14th and O, so getting between them is SUPER easy.   I could go on and on about Lincoln. I lived there for 5 years while I was attending UNL. I've been living in Omaha for the past 4 years and I definitely miss Lincoln a lot. It's an unassuming little city but it is a great place to live and in my opinion the funnest place to live in Nebraska."

I don't know how old you are but there's a relatively sizeable population of younger adults who are great in every possible way.  Further if you like being outdoors Lincoln is a great hub to get to the different types of terrain you can find in Nebraska. Excluding Western Nebraska where you're going to have to go out there yourself to experience and appreciate the sand hills.   I had a lot of the same worries you did when my wife and I moved here 6 years ago, but we have come to love Lincoln and will be very heartbroken if we were to ever leave."

lincoln,3ckpar,elbajo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:39:44 2015 UTC,"Some of the underrated food in town that hasn't been mentioned yet:  Doozy's: amazing hot sandwiches downtown. I'm not a big fan of sandwiches for the most part but I love Doozy's. There's only one location left sadly, we used to have one in the town I grew up in.  Lazzari's: everyone says Yia Yia's is the place to get pizza in town, but this is my preferred place right that's right across the street from it. The interior is kind of a dive but the pizza is really good and you don't get the pretentious crowd and employees you find at Yia Yia's.  Greta's Gourmet: as much as I love me some Honest Abe's, this is a great place to grab a burger on the south end of town. The owner is the son of the guy who invented the McRib and he really knows his burgers. The toppings are all mixed in the patty so it's not as messy as other places.  C. Berry's: from the outside it looks like any other bar downtown but it's actually a hipster BBQ place. The BBQ nachos are amazing and they have great mac and cheese too. Another great BBQ place is Phat Jack's but I haven't been in a couple years.  Bagels & Joe: nobody talks about it but it's my favorite coffee place in town. I used to live right behind it and there is fantastic coffee roasted in house. They have really good scotcharoos from time to time and live music on Friday nights. The staff is always incredibly friendly and if you're looking to escape the college crowds at the other coffee shops in town, this is the place to go.  Fuzzy's Tacos: yes I know it's a chain but I really like the food here. I have some friends from San Diego who say that this is their favorite place for tacos in town and the nachos are great too for just $6. They have a bar in the back too where you can get great deals on huge glasses of Shiner Bock.  Lincoln Community Foundation Garden: if you work downtown this is an incredible hidden gem for a lunch hangout. It's a small garden with lots of shade trees and places to sit and is really good on hot summer days. You can grab a decent lunch for less than $5 (the BBQ beef sandwich is surprisingly fantastic). There is live music on Wednesdays over lunch which is usually terrible and draws a ton of people so I usually have to find somewhere else to go that day."

lincoln,3ckpar,Nagaempress,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:50:57 2015 UTC,Lincoln isn't too bad of a city. I live a half an hour away so Lincoln's the closest city to me. It does have a lot of bike trails and IMHO I think that Ploughshare is the best microbrew though Empyrean is solid. I have yet to try Zipline or Blue Bloods.   For restaurants i'm somewhat limited but I do like Yiayia's for a slice of pizza. Bahnwich cafe isn't too bad. I don't know if they are all that great but my family used to go to Lee's chicken quite a bit though its older and I think the older crowd must like it.   The music scene is decent (though it doesn't seem so when Omaha is down the road.) I like the Zoo Bar a lot. Basically if you love college sports you'll like Lincoln a lot.   Overall I like Lincoln but I'm more of an Omaha person. Not that there's much difference but Lincoln's a nice city.

lincoln,3bx0p4,TeutonicTexan,5,Thu Jul 2 21:13:20 2015 UTC,Why has no one said wide range broadband? I would get them in a heartbeat if there weren't so many trees by my house.
lincoln,3bx0p4,xAIRGUITARISTx,4,Fri Jul 3 13:50:58 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that very few people can actually use this. I would love to try it, but have never lived somewhere with good line of sight.  Edit: Looking more closely, their prices don't look better than TWCs and I see no mention of upstream speeds. 21Mbps seems a little slow to me and that's their maximum. Unless it's a symmetrical connection, I'd rather pay $60 for 30/5 with time warner and not worry about losing Internet during bad weather."
lincoln,3bx0p4,zieen,2,Fri Jul 3 17:30:46 2015 UTC,"This is the answer that should be at the top, it's not on windstream's network and it is a fast and cheap service."
lincoln,3bx0p4,SpinnerMaster,2,Fri Jul 3 14:19:57 2015 UTC,"Their fastest connection is more than I've paid TWC for the last two years for a 9Mbps faster connection (30) with 5Mbps upstream.  I don't see any mention of upstream speeds looking at their site. Are they symmetrical connections? If they're the typical ~1Mbps up, I can't imagine switching to them."
lincoln,3bx0p4,zieen,10,Fri Jul 3 17:38:05 2015 UTC,Internet Nebraska. 29.99 a month. Time Warner service without the Time Warner. As far as I can tell they don't monitor your usage either. I would love to know if anyone can beat them.
lincoln,3bx0p4,work_safe_only,5,Thu Jul 2 21:35:57 2015 UTC,"30 gets you 3 Mbps, good luck streaming with that... Really it is 40 for 15, it used to be 40 for 10 so that is actually a needed boost.  Time warner can match that but only for the first year, then they inch it up. I am on the next tier of $50 and get 30 Mbps and some basic channels I rarely think to watch... But it is nice when we both are streaming something.  But yea, next time they try to bump me up I will switch to internet Nebraska. Considering they are now at 15 Mbps instead of 10 that is probably the easier deal."

I chose windstream for my business internet for about 6 months (chosen solely for cost reasons) and I'm already looking forward to switching."

lincoln,3bx0p4,BlindManBaldwin,2,Fri Jul 3 02:23:36 2015 UTC,"Windstream is shit. It's not cable so every time it storms you're going to run into issues. My old apartment complex forced us into getting them if we wanted TV service. It's shit. I was paying like $60 for 12mps but I would never get more than 7 or 8.   I switched to Time Warner after I moved and I like it. I've never encountered any speed issues in the last 15 months. I pay about $65 for 30mps with 5 upload. It normally averages about 26 which is very nice.  The only bad thing about TWC is their ""customer service"" sucks cocks and dicks. I pay the same time every month, which is like 5 days after my due date and they will call me like 3 times a day asking for their money, despite the fact that it's not even close to being 30 days late (normally 4-5). I've told them my situation but they never stop. It's ridiculous.  I also had issues with Windstream throttling my connection speed during large downloads."

It's very rarely down (never had an issue with storms) and I consistently get the speed I pay for, or slightly more.  I think where people run into trouble with them is when they are a long way from one of their substations. Reliability and speed greatly decrease with distance."

lincoln,3bx0p4,Adam2013,2,Fri Jul 3 00:26:36 2015 UTC,"Well, there are others, but Internet Nebraska just resells TWC and Windstream service.

I'm pretty sure they achieve this with fiber, or as their website calls it ""dark fiber"". I don't know if they service purely residential and if they did it would probably be out of your budget. It seems like they service companies or entire buildings or something.  An alternative for anyone that is interested in these guys might be to see if they would form a neighborhood fiber network that everyone could chip into.

IN's customer service is great, but you only get 3mbps down for $35/mo, which doesn't handle HD streaming.   TWC's support sucks, their customer support sucks, but to me they're the lesser evil. I always test within 10% of the speed I'm paying for, and have had reliable service from them at five different addresses in Lincoln. It's more expensive, something like $50/mo for 35mbps down, but the speed it's worth every penny imo."

Here's my final version:  ""Supreme Court ruling to legalize gay marriage vetoed by Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts""  In an unsurprising move, Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts issued a veto today of the United States Supreme Court ruling which grants same sex couples the freedom to marry. ""My first three vetos were overruled, so odds are in my favor that this one is bound to stick!"" Governor Ricketts happily proclaimed.  Attourney General Doug Peterson added, ""This has to be decided upon by the courts! Who are these folks to tell us how the constitution is supposed to be interpreted? I do not accept that this court's ruling overrides the sovereign legislature of Nebraska. That's not how it works.  The Supreme Court of the United States doesn't dictate to Nebraska legislators how laws are to be applied.""   When asked to which court he plans to go to appeal the United States Supreme Court's ruling, Peterson proudly stated ""the court of God Almighty and common sense!"" When reminded that there is no such court in existence, Peterson simply stated that he plans to have Ricketts veto every court's decision until they get a ruling they consider to be more favorable.    ""We will win this yet."" he said, ""Sure, they have 5 people on the SCOTUS, but we have the other four, the governor, myself, my pastor, that guy who stands with the giant cross in downtown Lincoln yelling at people, and hundreds of people at my church behind us.  The simple fact is, we outnumber them.  And while I'm on the subject, nobody had better accuse us of being homophobic either.  I have a good friend who was gay.

Sorry, I didn't mean to give the impression that we got married today. Today, we went from being legal strangers in the eyes of Nebraska law to being married. It might seem like a small thing, but my husband and I are both extremely happy.  We got married in the country where we currently live and our marriage was legal in the eyes of the US federal government after Windsor. Importantly for my non-American husband, Windsor conferred immigration rights to same-sex spouses, and we've been planning a move back to Lincoln ever since. My husband recently got his visa and we have plane tickets for Lincoln. It will feel great to land, knowing that we're now the same as every other married couple in Nebraska under the law."

From what was explained to me (not quite sure), it's possible they have family in CO that he may have gone off to, or possibly for other things.  The family has not said anything more than what is on the Facebook page, so I'm not aware of the reasoning they have for suspecting that he will be going to Colorado.    Thank you very much for putting the poster up at the amigos, unfortunately I no longer live in Lincoln, but I would certainly pop in if I did :)."

lincoln,3ack5k,OldBear62,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:39:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting theory. Do you think if the suspect was intending on doing a home invasion he would have parked closer to the home? It sounded like he got away on foot. It says the K9 unit tried to track him but lost his trail (maybe that is when the suspect entered the car). Do you think the suspect specifically targeted a certain house or was this person just looking to hit up a house? The botched home invasion makes sense, especially when there were NO verbal threats demanded by the suspect (give me your money etc. etc.).

They're beer isn't bad by any means, but it's nothing to write home.   Most beer drinkers that I know generally see Zipline as the best local brewery, and they bottle, which Ploughshare doesn't yet.  The biggest thing that has changed in the Lincoln beer scene is that the distribution from other locations has gotten so much better. We have literally 10x the number of breweries that distribute to us now than we did 5 years ago. There are a lot of good breweries too: Stone, Deschutes, New Holland, Founders, Oskar Blues.   I wish Lincoln had better breweries, but in the mean time there is plenty you are able to find from other breweries if you can't find what you're looking for locally."

Edit: I misread your text, sorry! I'm not sure about another brewery opening in Lincoln, but there is one in Omaha called Infusion. They have some pretty funky beers but their vanilla bean blonde is an awesome summer beer. As for new brews from Zip and Emperyan, I'm sure there will be something soon for fall.

Also, Kirk's Brew is a fantastic homebrew store if you do any of that (or are looking to start).  Other than that, Zipline, Blublood, and Empyrean have always made beer that impressed me.

Most inmates describe our prison system as an adult daycare or a holiday inn, and many MANY prefer it to working out in the real world and paying rent.   They will riot over something as small as not getting to violate a rule they don't see the point of (which is nearly all of them).   They are people, and I treat them with dignity and so do my co-workers and the admin certainly does. I would have to be hard pressed to ever compare the situation they themselves got themselves in to our situation as workers in the department who were lied to and sold on the idea that this job was actually a respectable career."

Renee mentioned that they were tight and focused on them during the session.  Renee charges $65.00 for 60 minutes (however, if you pay in cash you get $5.00 off). What I like the most is I can view her schedule online and book online without having to call. It's way more convenient for me this way so Im not on hold so long and can look at her schedule far in advance. Hope this helps!"

lincoln,39hg9z,TeutonicTexan,5,Thu Jun 11 19:08:40 2015 UTC,I would highly recommend checking out local landlords as opposed to the companies around here.  I had lived in apartments for ten years in Lincoln and have always found the best deals from local landlords who own converted houses.  Especially in the near south area which is only a ten minute bike ride to downtown.  The last place I rented before I bought was a three bedroom first floor of a house for 650 a month.
lincoln,39hg9z,Seek83er,3,Fri Jun 12 01:45:26 2015 UTC,"Yes OP, look into local landlords. I've had both a few times in the last 10 years and I've never had a single problem with local landlords and a dozen problems with the big companies, especially CIP. Most big places like that will constantly raise your rent every 6 months to a year by (in my case) $100. They will also look for any excuse to keep your deposit. The guy below me posted that he pays $550 a mo for a studio which is what I paid at CIP as well, it enventually got up to $625. Which, is insane. It was only like 500 square feet. I now live alone (with a dog),  in a 2 bed room, 1,100 square foot apartment for a staight $475 per month. Also avoid downtown, unless you like getting asked for change and cigarettes from drunks. The Wesleyan area is also a historic area, like downtown is, but it's a lot cleaner, safer and lot more ""friendly""."

I'm about a 10 minute bike ride from campus and I'm paying $550/mo for a studio.  If you get close to the capitol building, things will get a little cheaper, but it's a little seedier neighborhood. If you want to directly be in the downtown district you're going to end up paying a lot more, but you'll be a short walk from campus"

lincoln,38j5xk,rumilb,3,Fri Jun 5 00:06:51 2015 UTC,"The reason is the Lincoln ordnance states a Crosswalk is for Pedestrian use. If you're on a bicycle you can't be concerted a Pedestrian under the definition.  10.02.090 Crosswalk. Crosswalk shall mean: (a) that part of a roadway at an intersection included within the connections of the lateral lines of the sidewalks on opposite sides of the highway measured from the curbs, or in the absence of curbs from the edges of the traversable roadway; or (b) any portion of a roadway at an intersection or elsewhere distinctly indicated for pedestrian crossing by lines or other markings on the surface.   10.02.270 Pedestrian. Pedestrian shall mean any person afoot.  This is a good little local study but it is not very surprising as most national studies say the same thing. The chance of being hit by a car is much higher if your riding on the sidewalk and across crosswalks. You're much more visible riding in the street in the place drivers are looking. Just ride on roadways you feel comfortable on. Very happy this is getting some local press."

He may not know the meaning of what he says, but he knows that it's upsetting the people around him and he's loving every moment of it. That impulse doesn't come entirely from poor conditioning. He has a temperament for hell-raising, and apart from needing better role models, a little public shaming might help turn him around before that attitude takes him to prison later in life. Beat him? Clearly no. But you can't be nice to that kid. He needs to cry a few times before he even starts to get the lesson. The man recording was a saint."

lincoln,36rl4a,notdoxingmyselfagain,3,Thu May 21 15:49:30 2015 UTC,"Don't be tempted to move downtown or near the Capital building. The prices are pretty cheap (I paid around $350-$450) for a 1 bedroom but it's not worth it in my opinion. I lived down there for about 3 years, anywhere between 12th & F, 9th &E and 17th & A . It's kind of fun if you're young and dumb (21) and like going out to the bars and stuff but the neighborhood gets old really fast. It seems like it's impossible to walk more than 4 blocks without someone asking for a cigarette or money, some drunk wandering around or general shitty neighbors who party at all hours of the night.  I moved about 4 years ago and I don't regret it for a second. I really, really like the area just a little bit east of Wesleyan University. It's a historic neighborhood so it doesn't have that carbon copy feeling that some parts of town have, each house and building is different. It's also about 50x cleaner than downtown. I love going for walks and seeing everyone out walking their dogs.   I'm not sure on the general prices of the area but I lucked out and I only pay $475 for a two bedroom, all electric apartment that allows dogs and has a fenced in back yard."
lincoln,36rl4a,smgulz,5,Fri May 22 20:14:43 2015 UTC,"As far as good/tough neighborhoods go, I don't think much has changed in the past 5-10 years. I'd say the apartment advice on Reddit still holds.  Lincoln isn't a big town. If you don't mind commuting, you can drive from anywhere in town to the University (either campus) in 30 minutes or less.  In broad strokes, the tough patches of town are:   west of 33rd street and north of Capitol Parkway (downtown/Haymarket excluded) west of 48th and north of Huntington   As mentioned, this is a broad generalization, and you will find plenty of good patches mixed in with the tough patches in these areas. Keep in mind that Lincoln tough bears little resemblance to New York tough – which isn't to say that Lincoln doesn't have problems.  The Near South neighborhood has a fair number of apartments and is easily within biking distance of UNL's main campus.  edit: formatting"
lincoln,36rl4a,chinahusker07,3,Thu May 21 16:35:24 2015 UTC,Also most bike paths lead to the campus. So commuting by bike isn't difficult.

Which masters program will you be going into? I know a lot of people on campus I could link you up with the right people.   Do you belong to any cultural or religious minority groups?

lincoln,36rl4a,AMathmagician,2,Thu May 21 18:24:52 2015 UTC,"One tip: most people in Lincoln mentally divide the town at O street. North of O is generally seen as poorer, but your rent money may go further there since property tends to be cheaper. Despite its reputation, there are lots of nice places to live north of O.

I'll also toss in a turkey vulture as a possibility, since they are (relatively) common in Lincoln but you may not be familiar with them. A bald eagle is possible; they've been sighted out by Oak Lake before, which matches your ""north of downtown"" description. Last, it may have been some sort of owl."

Two weeks ago while drinking at a dive bar just outside of Spanish Fort, Alabama, one of the patrons asked where I was from.  After I said Lincoln, I fully expected ""Oh you're a 'Husker"", much to my shock he asked me about The Zoo Bar.  The story went, he and his GF were on a trip to  KC and saw a band play in a bar down the street from their hotel.  After the show they hung out with them and asked where they were playing next, and it was The Zoo Bar, they joked with him and said they should follow them up for the show, well having noting to do, they did just that.

This will typically allow you to make your own prints wherever you want. They still retain the copyright, however.  I will sell the copyright in some situations, such as corporate work for magazines or pictures for a publication, but it's going to cost a lot, as it's a loss of potential advertising income and exposure, since I can't use the pictures anymore."

Roosevelt as a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife.  The refuge comprises 7,350 acres (30 km2) along the eastern edge of the Missouri River floodplain south of Mound City, Missouri in Holt County, Missouri.  The refuge is bounded by the Loess Hills on the east with a trail going to the top built originally by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The most dramatic moments occur during spring and fall migrations, when the refuge serves as a chokepoint for hundreds of thousands of ducks and geese (particularly snow geese) on the Central Flyway. As many as 475 bald eagles have been sighted on the refuge in the winter. The refuge annually celebrates the eagle visits with ""Eagle Days"" celebrations. In February 2013, over one million snow geese were counted.     Image from article i     Interesting: Tarkio River | Loess Hills | Holt County, Missouri   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

lincoln,34zgh6,ceasterday,5,Wed May 6 04:55:23 2015 UTC,"Based on my personal experiences, they could use some improvement.  When I was in college, our house was robbed three times, once we even caught the guys (one was Richie Incognito) stealing our stereo and speakers out the basement window and nothing ever came of any of the robberies.  I think they might have had to do diversion, but we were never reimbursed for the items they destroyed.  And it took them almost an hour to arrive at our house.  They were pretty quick to respond to my 911 call regarding the James White shooting in our backyard on 33rd and Fair."
lincoln,34zgh6,Bartman383,2,Wed May 6 05:29:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to suggest they were perfect or anything, just that compared to a lot of police departments in the news right now LPD looks pretty good. For example back in the occupy days they handled everything well and were able to get people to peaceably disperse when necessary. Meanwhile other cities were using tear gas and batons. Although to be fair I imagine a lot of that has to with our residents being calmer to begin with."

lincoln,34zgh6,disgruntled_soviet,7,Wed May 6 20:06:18 2015 UTC,I see police officers all the time and I doubt we actually have a need for more. After all we were once named a top five safe city.
lincoln,34zgh6,redchan4it,5,Wed May 6 04:44:52 2015 UTC,I don't think we need more police. They have a good handle on where the bad parts of town are and how to manage traffic on game days and such. They are pretty good about leveraging federal grants for special occasions like certain drinking holidays so they can ramp up staff for the public safety. I've mostly had good interactions with LPD.
lincoln,34zgh6,vicemagnet,3,Wed May 6 05:55:59 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine this being a good idea. Then again, as an Omaha resident I mostly associate the Police with occasional brutality and expensive pension plans."

lincoln,34zgh6,XA36,4,Wed May 6 04:05:19 2015 UTC,"One time I was driving around at night looking at potential houses to buy that had been listed as ""for sale."" (I work the off shift) I would pull into the driveway and walk around the yard a bit if I found one I liked.   Well wouldn't u know it, someone saw me and reported me and my friend who was with me as being suspicious. They also lied and said we were breaking car windows and stealing things. Within 5 minutes I was surrounded by at least 10 cop cars.  I explained what we were doing, showed them the real-estate listings, and they found no evidence of stolen goods or broken anything. (Obviously) they soon realized the misunderstanding and let us go.  I mentioned to one police officer that I was impressed with the number of police cars that responded.  He laughed and replied ""yeah, we get some really slooow nights around here a lot of the time, so when something interesting happens, EVERYBODY shows up.""   So to answer your question, no, we don't need more police officers sitting in their squad cars with their thumbs up their butts waiting for something interesting to happen. They're bored enough as it is."
lincoln,34zgh6,phroug2,4,Wed May 6 20:37:05 2015 UTC,"Wasn't Stebbing a police officer at one time?  I don't think we need anymore personally, but the trend is leaning towards a police state being the popular thing these days."
lincoln,34zgh6,thechickenfucker,1 point,Tue May 5 22:05:18 2015 UTC,"I was a paramedic in Lincoln up until around a year ago.  I have to give LPD a lot of credit; they were usually pretty damn great to work with.  I think the growth of the city vs the growth of staffing is the real issue; I don't recall the exact numbers, but it's been many years since the force has grown, with the population growing quite a bit since.  Depending on the time of day, it is entirely feasible that the shift on duty could be overwhelmed by a relatively small incident.  There has also been some increases in gang activity migrating in from Omaha as OPD cracks down harder.  From my understanding, problems with crime are getting to the ""when, not if"" stage."
lincoln,34zgh6,b0bx13,1 point,Wed May 6 22:40:21 2015 UTC,Also not an expert but I would say if they want to spend more money on police then they need to pay them more.  I know a guy who has been on the force for 12 years and makes less than 40k.  I would not go out and dodge bullets for that...
lincoln,34zgh6,SwngnaMs,-1,Wed May 6 20:30:51 2015 UTC,"It's a subjective experience for many, depending upon where you live in Lincoln. For a city of our size and growth rate, more officers would be a good thing. Of course, you'll always get some naysayers who think that being called out on their lawbreaking is a valid reason to direct city hall planning."

One Bench for barbell bench. I have gone to plenty of gyms here in town and anytime so far is my favorite. Especially for Olympic lifts, the only other 24 hour gym I can think of is Snap fitness, and the couple of those I've been to only had a Smith machine, no squat racks."

I was told that she was seen near 20th and Superior sometime earlier today. She's all black with the exception of a little bit of white on her stomach/between her back legs. She also has a spot near the base of her tail where the fur is shorter due to being shaved for surgery. There is a $100 reward if someone can find her. If you have any information, please message me ASAP. Thank you, reddit."

lincoln,34ic04,wwjz,2,Fri May 1 12:09:40 2015 UTC,"Just call Capital City Refuse.  There are so many different garbage contractors in the city (20+ IIRC), they are all pretty much competitively priced.    As for a Bobcat, depending on the size you want, it's going to run you $200-300 a day.  You are also going to have to rent a trailer to tow it if you don't have one that will handle the 3000lb machine.  I assume you have a vehicle that can tow 5000+ lbs."

lincoln,34ic04,Malone500,2,Sat May 2 11:53:27 2015 UTC,"Somewhere around 100-150$, you may consider asking if it'd be cheaper to load it all when they're there with the box. If it is and that's something you wanted to do, pile it in the street the day before or morning before you have the rolloff, cone it off. And load it up when they arrive. Also, you might consider getting getting teeth on the loaders bucket, might make digging all that rock up a bit easier."
