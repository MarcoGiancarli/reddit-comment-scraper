electrohouse,3e2ycv,I_am_who,19,Tue Jul 21 15:38:10 2015 UTC,"I was going to post this a few weeks ago. I believe that electro house is dead. There's one or two tracks that come out that I like, but it wasn't anything like a few years ago when I was practically downloading everything.   A lot of my favourite artists got big, became mainstream and sold out, and to me everything that comes out just sounds the same.   It's a shame really, but we all knew this EDM bubble was going to burst sooner or later."
electrohouse,3e2ycv,lukejames1111,8,Tue Jul 21 17:37:38 2015 UTC,Even Hardwell and Nicky Romero used to make sick electro house :(
electrohouse,3e2ycv,andee510,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:50:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you noticed but those names are now dropping in popularity lol, Hardwell was major big name couple years ago and Romero with his only major hit ""Toulouse"" in 2012. Additional signs that EDM is dying down."
electrohouse,3e2ycv,layzworm,6,Tue Jul 21 21:03:17 2015 UTC,edm isn't dying down just electro house
electrohouse,3e2ycv,djcodeblue,3,Tue Jul 21 22:23:37 2015 UTC,"EDM is not dying down at all, you are completely wrong about that. But electro house is dying yes."
electrohouse,3e2ycv,brodievonorchard,2,Wed Jul 22 00:07:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, maybe I am exaggerating but who knows, we are now halfway through this decade and usually there 2 major trends that happen within that time frame."
electrohouse,3e2ycv,andee510,2,Wed Jul 22 00:33:50 2015 UTC,"As someone who's been in the EDM scene since '97, this isn't the end, this is the transition. When I first cut my teeth, Aphrodite had just come up, and drum and bass was huge. It was being swallowed by Jungle, but that didn't matter. Two years later everyone loved Trance. That got boring, though, so Trance gave way to progressive trance and Nu-Energy. As their popularity faded, Hard House came back with it's new offshoot, Electro House. Then people started rediscovering Techno again, particularly Detroit Techno. That popularity was soon eclipsed by Dub Step. Then a bunch of fakers flooded Dub Step with pointless wubby bass music, and in just a couple of years, no one would admit they ever liked it.  Trust me, genres are perennial in EDM. Someone new will come along (or more likely someone old publishing under a new name), they'll get everyone pumped over a new genre, or a new style of an old genre, then a bunch of posers will try to copy them and flood the market with crap, and the whole damn cycle will start over again. I've been hearing a lot of good Liquid DnB lately. And the Future Garage Ambient... Whatever the hell Odesza makes is pretty hot right now. Don't worry if you don't like that stuff, though. It won't last long."
electrohouse,3e2ycv,lukejames1111,6,Wed Jul 22 08:39:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly! It's either they got too big for themselves and moved up to huge EDM sound or stagnated their sound to the point they become irrelevant (Dada Life is a perfect example). Another reason is that many electrohouse producers have mature their sound or are overshadowed by the EDM sound. Either you copy it to stay relevant and make your living or you do your own thing and eat scrapes. Yeah, this is just the foreshadow of the EDM bubble burst due to the fact that nearly everyone in it has the same formula of sound. Which is good, everything should go back to square one."

electrohouse,3e2ycv,andee510,8,Tue Jul 21 18:19:30 2015 UTC,"Avicii & Zedd both used to kill it here 3 years ago, but sold out massively. Avicii didn't really surprise me, he always wanted to make hits for the radio - even though they were a bit 'dancey'. Zedd surprised me though. He went from producing Shotgun, Scorpion Move, Slam the Door... to Stay the Night. I used to idolize him.  Dada Life were another who own a few spots on the all time top voted here, along with Feed Me, Porter Robinson, Madeon, Wolfgang Gartner... These guys have just disappeared.  It's sad really because this is only the type of music I like, and it doesn't really exist anymore :/"

I thought Zedd was the greatest after ""Shave It"" and the Zelda remix he made. Then ughhh. Dada Life was INSANE live. Kids were dropping left and right at the show I went to haha. I wish Clockwork was still making music, but I guess I understand that RL Grime is way more popular.   Feed Me does DnB stuff as Spor now. Don't know if he plans on releasing Feed Me material again. Porter is really different, but I like him still. I did like his Spitfire and ""Language"" stuff better, though. I just don't know why electro house isn't popular any more. Nothing calls me to the dance floor like electro house."

I feel the exact same way you do, used to love his work, just didn't think he would give up his sound entirely for top40 crap. Why bother building up a style and fanbase just to abandon it a few years later"
electrohouse,3e2ycv,andee510,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:54:30 2015 UTC,Madeon still produces some good songs imo. They're progressively getting more and more mainstream sounding but to me that seems common for artists that gain popularity from mashups and remixes primarily

electrohouse,3e2ycv,DrDuPont,3,Tue Jul 21 23:34:07 2015 UTC,"I've moved on to some pretty different stuff from electro house. Driving, heady beats tends to be where I lean nowadays. Proper old school house, jungle, afrobeat, broken beat, etc. You can go through my submitted links to get a taste of the variety that I'm into.   If you're interested in specifics, I've been pretty into Galcher Lustwerk recently. Romare's become one of my favorite artists. ETCH is a rising star. The new Thundercat is pretty tight too.  Anyway, pretty far left field from electro, but it has been a while!"
electrohouse,3e2ycv,philefluxx,2,Tue Jul 21 23:54:10 2015 UTC,I'd suggest /r/futurebeats for you then. It's pretty good.
electrohouse,3e2ycv,CptSpaulding,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:41:03 2015 UTC,A great suggestion. futurebeats has some solid stuff.
electrohouse,3e2ycv,vutall,7,Wed Jul 22 07:01:18 2015 UTC,"I used to be a huge into spinning Electro house back when you'd find tracks by Cirez D (Eric Prydz) or when Deadmau5 was still being referred to as Dead Mau 5 lol. Anyways, ya Electro is not Electro anymore. Its become basically mainstream EDM and it does all sound the same.   If you are a lover of old school Electro House I would suggest checking out Future House. A lot of people will disagree with me on sub-genres so take what I say as merely opinion, but for me it seems the sounds we loved back in 2004-2008 that we called Electro House are basically now Future House. The heavier sounds are basically Big Room.   I personally cannot stand what they now call EDM, its just so shallow. Everyone is looking for the ""drop"" now as if they completely miss the fact the track as a whole is what makes it great. This is a result of the laptop DJ becoming so popular and bedroom production being so much easier than in the past.   Anyways here are a few examples of tracks I use from Future House and Big Room to create what I still consider Electro House sets.   Paul Oakenfold - You could be happy (Paul Oakenfold Future House Mix) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkCbZcgRmjk  Black Tiger Sex Machine - On the Run (Original Mix) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBpaU8DJJfw  And just from one fan of the sub genre to another, this track was recently re-released. Trying to decide of today's EDM kids would get down if I add it back into rotation:  PotBelleez - Dont Hold Back https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p20GPkmJHQ"

electrohouse,3e2ycv,wikifreaks,3,Tue Jul 21 17:05:54 2015 UTC,"It just saddens me a bit. Yeah, styles of electrohouse come and go (complextro, dirty dutch) but now it seems the whole subgenre is pretty much lifeless for the last 6 months or so.

I'm from Boston & the club scene here is the perfect reflection of how electro was the 'in' genre 3 years ago while now it has been replaced with deep house, tropical house, techno. For example, 3 years ago - a club called prime would  book any huge name in the electro scene you could imagine - Hardwell, Wolfgang Gartner, Bingo Players, Dirty South, Fedde Le Grande, DVLM, etc etc. AND at the time, I remember the buzz being HUGE when these guys would come to town and play. Fast forward 3 years to present day & the same mentioned club, Prime, now instead exclusively showcases the likes of Amine Edge & Dance, Gorgon City, Claude Von Stroke, Shiba San, Justin Martin, Eats Everything, etc. It's just all about what's 'in' ... and at least in Boston, the deep/tech sounds are most certainly in - just the way it is."

For the reasons you mentioned, it's simply not worth staying subscribed anymore. 80% of the posts that make it to my front page are either megahit EDM producers (Zedd, Hardwell) or not even close to the right genre (trap in most cases).  I tried to push the mods so many times and got ignored enough that I became happily complacent and watched this once-thriving subreddit burn itself out. Electro-house honestly isn't dead. AgNO3 and Andrei Stephan are two names I can think of off the top of my head who are absolutely killing it, and whose sound doesn't mindlessly melt into the trends of the day.  Either way, a subreddit is meaningless unless effectively moderated, and it is clear why this particular community has plummeted into irrelevance beyond repair. It was a good run and I'm sure I'll run into some of you in /r/shallowhouse, /r/trap, or /r/futurebeats.   Good night, sweet prince.   unsubscribes"

electrohouse,3e2ycv,TheGreatScribble,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:50:20 2015 UTC,"Right, and I think you could make the argument that the 'EDM bubble' is a result of the cultural shift onto the internet, which provides instant gratification and a continuous source of new material through services like Soundcloud and YouTube. Dubstep (and electrohouse) were socially relevant because of their newness; I'm guessing no one here has heard Felguk at any house parties recently... right?  What I'm trying to say is that tastes change because artists evolve, and the cycle repeats once there's enough mediocre garbage inundating the scene, as artists realize the need to set themselves apart (a la Heldens, who once produced very average bigroom).   In some ways I hope guys like Dada Life and Tommy Trash can make a comeback, because man, their music was a kind of pure bass-pounding energy that I just haven't felt recently. That said, I'm excited to see what the future of 'EDM' holds, and can only hope that the electro sound makes a comeback."
electrohouse,3e2ycv,Metal_Malachy,2,Wed Jul 22 01:13:38 2015 UTC,"I think lots of artists have moved on. The closest thing to electro house lately has been Madeon's Adventure album, I think. Pretty much everything else has been variations of big room, or dutch house. I think electro heads need to move on to Glitch, Tech House, and Future Bass, cause that's all that's coming out lately."
electrohouse,3e2ycv,djcodeblue,2,Wed Jul 22 00:33:24 2015 UTC,"It really saddens me that Porter and Madeon completely abandoned electro (and Zedd but at least he hasn't actually said he's done with it). I remember in 2012 when complextro was at its height and you had Zedd, Porter, Madeon, Wolfgang, Benassi, deadmau5 with tracks like ""A city in Florida"" and r3hab, tommy trash, and even Afrojack. I personally think Dada Life hasn't made a decent tracks since Kick Out The Epic and all their tracks now are like warmed over cheese. In 2013 I remember a lot of artists at EDC Orlando playing pretty electro-heavy sets (including martin solveig), but now you almost never hear any of that stuff. I feel like the only producers who still make complextro style tracks are Botnek and occasionally Dyro."

My favorite edm are tunes that stab me in the mind and heart. They find a way to take out all of the doubt and insecurity till all that's left is confidence and a feeling I can take on the whole world. I can do anything. Usually it's songs with lyrics that are super positive. The latest song for me is the Vicetone - Nothing Stopping Me ft. tune.

electrohouse,3dcfe6,Sub-cidal,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:36:12 2015 UTC,"MitiS - Open Window (feat. Anna Yvette), so the lyrics for this may not be up your alley, but it is one of the best melodies I've ever heard, seriously brilliant.  TheFatRat - Never Be Alone , in terms of feeling happy, this  is my go to. It makes me feel like I can take on the world, no matter how bad things get!  E.S Posthumus - Unstoppable , okay so this isn't EDM. But it's the first thing that came to mind when you said unstoppable, feel free to skip this one if you're dead set on EDM.  Au5 & Fractal - Dreaming, this is a song that motivates the shit out of me, really a beautiful song.  Hope this was a little better!"

electrohouse,3dcfe6,chrontonamojay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:39:56 2015 UTC,This song was pretty bad-ass. I'm going to add it to my regular tunes. Not sure it fits the workout playlist. I'm not sure why. I can't explain these things. But really cool song.

electrohouse,3cu2hl,jkkidding,13,Fri Jul 10 19:53:36 2015 UTC,"Love these threads! This sub isn't ever very active lately and I'm bored, so you're getting more than 5 but deal with it, haha. These are some of my hardest hitting Electro House tracks as of late:    Bali Bandits - Bad Bat Anything from Middle Milk (Plasmapool Records, look him up. He's fantastic.) James Egbert - Underdog Black Tiger Sex Machine x Lektrique - Religion Black Tiger Sex Machine - NUMBERS Kai Wachi - PROPER Snails - VMPR   I don't know if you guys are into this new ""Future House"" sound. (edit: ""Bass House""; thanks /u/LuckyCVT - I guess the Future House stuff would be less aggressive? I get specific with my genres but I can only handle so many electronic music inceptions.) I'm not really into Deep House, but I've been really digging how Future House sorta is a blend of Electro and Deep. Here are some of my faves in that category:    JOYRYDE - FLO / MERCY Lethal Bizzle - Fester (Don Diablo Remix) MUST DIE! - Hellcat (Habstrakt Remix) Caroline Koch - Timeless (Tchami Remix) Tchami & AC Slater - Missing You  NIGHTOWLS X Jameston Thieves - Closer (Original Mix) Chocolate Puma - I Could Be Wrong NGHTMRE & Slander - Warning (Ghastly Remix) Borgore & Jauz - Lindsay Lohan Jauz & Ephwurd - Rock the Party (Actually isn't released until July 17, but check the preview.)   If you dig this, a lot of these artists have other tracks that are also excellent. I highly recommend checking out other stuff from Habstrakt, Tchami, Ghastly, Don Diablo, and Jauz. Also JOYRYDE is actually a side project of the guys from Lets Be Friends. Some great stuff."

I've always like the aggressive side of the different genres, so I guess I like Bass House then. I've found quite a few tracks in this style as well as less aggressive, which I guess would be the ""Future House"" thing. Thanks man!"
