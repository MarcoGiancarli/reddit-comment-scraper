JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,WildZeroWolf,5,Sat Jul 18 17:49:21 2015 UTC,I'm glad she's going to do more Begiragons in the future. Maybe something with Omane as they were entertaining during the challenge.

JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,jononyx,9,Sat Jul 18 10:13:17 2015 UTC,oh man shes so cute :3
JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,fuzzynyanko,6,Fri Jul 17 14:02:50 2015 UTC,"This makes me wonder if Megwin looked younger after the challenge ended. She was looking much older in the challenge, and I bet it was due to the lack of sleep, plus the lighting in the room  I also didn't see her as ugly though. She did have bags under her eyes, but I thought she was overall pretty in the sleep challenge"
JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,Suic,13,Fri Jul 17 17:41:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah people were being way too harsh to call her ugly!  Anyone lacking sleep for that long doesn't look their best, and considering that she was still quite cute."
JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,slappymcnutface,3,Fri Jul 17 17:54:07 2015 UTC,"The makeup helps too.   She's definitely not ugly. It's kind of sad to see her devote half her follow-up video to ""I'm not ugly, right guys?"""
JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,fuzzynyanko,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:47:52 2015 UTC,"Even when the makeup got messed up, I thought she was pretty"
JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,Outlulz,2,Sat Jul 18 16:55:01 2015 UTC,"Didn't she make a comment early, early on about needing her makeup to look good during the challenge so she didn't look ugly?  I think she just pokes fun at herself."
JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,AppleChiaki,2,Fri Jul 17 18:46:06 2015 UTC,"I think she meant it. It was when she did the breathing challenge, putting her head in the water. She looked concerned about her makeup coming off.   (Also waking up early to apply her makeup before the start.)"
JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,PeterFnet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:23:35 2015 UTC,Pretty sure this is the only reason we watch this.
JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,Ken808,3,Sat Jul 18 02:05:15 2015 UTC,"Can't wait for Gacha Bike!  To anyone wanting more, I'd suggest Begiragons Soaking challenge.  Most of the usual suspects, and just as ridiculous."
JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,ChikNoods,3,Fri Jul 17 17:03:29 2015 UTC,"I can catch some of what she says, but I'm not seeing ENG sub? CC translate is so inaccurate."
JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,Rainingmadness,5,Fri Jul 17 18:40:25 2015 UTC,The CC translate was on point for this particular video.
JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,ChikNoods,2,Fri Jul 17 19:56:43 2015 UTC,"At one point mine said "" IRAQ "" -- was she talking about Iraq @ 2:12 -- I don't feel like she is. It had random ass words thrown in too.   what im seeing -> http://i.imgur.com/eGJP1P6.png"
JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,Rainingmadness,5,Fri Jul 17 19:59:55 2015 UTC,"make sure the CC settings is on ""Japanese"" and not ""Japanese (auto-generated)"""

JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,Calorie_Mate,2,Sun Jul 19 01:18:32 2015 UTC,"Yay Aimin! I'm glad to see a follow up by her, since I've grown very fond of her. I'm already looking to see her return to Begiragons."
JapaneseGameShows,3dlyzc,assassin5,2,Fri Jul 17 17:17:14 2015 UTC,Of course you look ugly when you don't sleep for 24+ hours let alone 40+ hours. I have a friend who did a stay-awake competition at a LAN party and near the end i could hardly recognize his face.
