It compares to a 750m ( http://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Iris-Pro-Graphics-6200.125593.0.html )  So, you'll get to play a lot of new games and in decent settings (medium-high). But, it will not be the leap you would want from upgrading from a 2011 to a 2015 gpu. For that, and to be able to play games at maximum settings, you would need a dedicated gpu with 4gb vRAM if possible, for future proof.  Buy an iMac instead. :)"

macgaming,3dzw1x,lmsafn13415,4,Mon Jul 20 21:47:30 2015 UTC,"OS, doesn't matter whatever you like the most, I haven't used windows 8 or 10 yet but I assume they're probably better or at least should be.  I think windows itself will take up about 16 to 20 GB of space, i'd give it about 25 GB to be safe. Meaning whatever games you want to install will determine how much bigger you make it, Since you have 120 GB with 80 GB left I'd recommend going 60 GB which leaves you with 40 GB on windows and 20 GB on mac. You don't want this to be too small on windows as after you install it and everything you can't change it. Also keep in mind, large games can take anywhere from 3 to 60 GB just by themselves. (GTA V).   Bootcamp will not slow down your mac. You are just using the extra space on your hard drive as a new partition. Imagine you are splitting your hard-drive in half to make 2. They don't slow each other when you boot up into them because they are separate.  With so little hard drive space and the mediocre specs of the 13"" rMBP, I recommend you just don't bother installing windows and stick to mac gaming. Install Steam and buy and download games through that for Mac. There's a huge variety and you should be able to find something small or big you would like to buy and play, if not there is a bunch of Free to Play games through Steam.  Good luck!"
macgaming,3dzw1x,AliAwesome,3,Mon Jul 20 23:30:28 2015 UTC,"For the hard drive space, I am going to use an external hard drive to store my games. I would use steam but I already have many PC games I have bought, and it would be a waste to buy them again. Most games are also not available for macs. I don't really have any interest in the newer games like GTA so most should take under 5gb"
macgaming,3dzw1x,jonesy1991,2,Tue Jul 21 00:31:55 2015 UTC,Just bear in mind that I'm sure I've read somewhere that running games off an external HD isn't recommended.

macgaming,3dzw1x,Nickster93,2,Tue Jul 21 08:15:00 2015 UTC,Once you download stuff it cannot be changed however uninstalling the partition is super easy if you decide you want to make it larger or smaller later however you will lose all your data on the windows partition.
macgaming,3dzw1x,jonesy1991,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:17:03 2015 UTC,I use Windows 8 and it runs just dandy.  Pretty sure you can't install a partition with less than 20GB and I would recommend a good chunk more than that depending on what games you're going to install and how big each will be! I put a 250GB partition but obviously that's not going to work here. Perhaps 50/60GB?

macgaming,3dr7yr,Fl3mez,4,Sat Jul 18 19:19:52 2015 UTC,"Well the only reason Apple proubably did not update drivers is because windows 10 is still considered in beta.

Also BCA is hit but mostly miss with the fusion drive I'm using. I've had to do work arounds. Some of them actually defeating the one of the benefits of even having the fusion drive (slow boot time).  All I can do is hope for the best.

macgaming,3dnogw,ForzaRossi,7,Fri Jul 17 19:20:46 2015 UTC,Well make sure your not running it at native resolution. Also Yosemite kind of sucks balls so that could be a problem as well. Don't worry El Cap is awesome and fixes Yosemite's openGL issues.
macgaming,3dnogw,The_Shivs,2,Fri Jul 17 19:48:04 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah.. This is a good point. When you run a retina resolution, that will definitely slow stuff down. I never thought of that.   Trying changing the resolution of your desktop (as well) to something non retina then starting up a game. You'll probably need to download specific software for that. Let me know the results.   Also, my typical knee jerk response to reading the post is to play in Bootcamp. But it strange you are getting a worst performance than your previous mac."
macgaming,3dnogw,Amadeus_Ray,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:54:13 2015 UTC,You can adjust resolution settings in the display menu.   And most games have a video settings section that will allow you to adjust just that programs resolution. So you don't have to turn off retina for the whole mac.
macgaming,3dnogw,The_Shivs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:33:49 2015 UTC,I mention the desktop resolution because I find it likely that it's powering that as well while you're playing. That's just my 2 cents.
macgaming,3dnogw,Amadeus_Ray,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:35:36 2015 UTC,It's not. It only powers what is being displayed at any given time.
macgaming,3dnogw,The_Shivs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:39:19 2015 UTC,"Actually the way OS X windowing works it will render the game at the resolution you choose as you mentioned however it will then upscale it to a native back buffer (as the OS is running in full Retina resolution).   This means even if you're playing the game on a low resolution as the OS is running in a higher resolution the graphics card will have to scale in the background. This will impact performance especially in terms of VRAM, the worse case scenario is with the 2GB Retina iMacs as they have to power a full 5K resolution screen.   The MacBookPro's are better in this regard as the Retina resolution is lower on the rMBP compared to the iMac however the same issue occurs to a lesser degree."
macgaming,3dnogw,edddeduck_feral,2,Mon Jul 20 08:12:16 2015 UTC,"Run it at 1050p or lower, don't run at 2880p. Also, boot camp to get more performance on the exact same game/hardware"

Anyways personally I'd put windows on it via bootcamp, because mouse acceleration on OS X feels weird in cs, and maybe consider turning things up not down.

macgaming,3d5s0s,FrankOBall,0,Tue Jul 14 23:10:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with the top comment: go for the Microsoft joypad.  I have a Xbox360/PC version (USB, not remote) which works well with Steam games, especially the ones by Valve, which support it natively.  I also use emulators such as Enjoy2/Enjoyable, that transform joypad input to keyboard input in order to play older games adapted for Mac that don't have joystick/pad support, but they don't work (they don't recognize the down and left directions, for example).  It works awfully bad with GTA Vice City (bear with me, I have an old MacBook, so newer versions don't run), at the point that it's unplayable.  Braid, Bastion, Elemental and Escape Goat work smoothly, as well as Source games, not only the 100% Valve ones, as I already said, but others such as Dear Esther and The Stanley Parable as well.  If you're into nostalgia and emulation, it works very well with SNes9x. Still haven't managed to make it work with NEStopia, though.  One last thing: it's not supported natively and you'll need the driver recommended by Book_talker_abouter."
macgaming,3d60ua,johnwithcheese,2,Mon Jul 13 20:15:34 2015 UTC,PS2 can only be emulated natively in boot camp but most decent macs should be able to emulate the well supported games.   Even a macbook air can run a lot of games on Dolphin fairly  well.
macgaming,3d60ua,aazel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:14:04 2015 UTC,"Don't know about those emulators, but I've gotten great performance out of PS1, N64, SNES, and NES emulators."

macgaming,3d23q6,HamwakHall,2,Sun Jul 12 22:18:37 2015 UTC,I was able to get the game running using crossover. Actually works surprisingly well.

macgaming,3d23q6,solarian132,2,Tue Jul 14 02:05:20 2015 UTC,"I don't understand. What .exe file? If you've downloaded the game onto an instance of Steam being run through Wine, you boot the game from within the Steam interface."
macgaming,3d23q6,l3l_aze,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:17:11 2015 UTC,"Right, so I'd have to download a Windows version of steam and run it through Wine. As it is, I downloaded a Mac version of Steam and just thought the install file for Rocket League would be on my hard drive once I bought it, and then I'd just use wine on that file.  Any luck on your end?"
macgaming,3d23q6,aaabballo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:36:29 2015 UTC,"Nothing is downloaded when you buy a game, so you have to run Steam through Wine and then download the game through Steam.  No luck here. I have a hunch it has something to do with running a 32 bit version of Wine running a 32 bit version game on a 64 bit OS—or, at least, the way it bugs out is consistent with problems related to a discrepancy between the OS and the version of the game. At this point I've spent a ridiculous amount of time troubleshooting this, though—I think dual-booting is really the only way."
macgaming,3d23q6,JFeldhaus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:38:46 2015 UTC,"What are you using under Screen options as far as ""Use Mac driver instead of X11"", and the other 3 next to it? How about the Windows version set in Advanced->Tools->Config Utility (winecfg)? (default tab, towards the bottom; default setting should be WinXP).  Not tried this yet, but can usually do well with Wineskin ports.  Edit: what's your system specs?  Another edit: forgot to say - running 32-bit executables doesn't matter. I play PD2 and other 32-bit games on 64-bit OS X through Wineskin quite well."
macgaming,3d15lt,The_Shivs,6,Sun Jul 12 17:39:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not a gamer, but I've seen performance improvements in Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. I suspect any boosts at this point are the general optimizations Apple has done, rather than Metal itself."
macgaming,3d15lt,GadgetComa,2,Sun Jul 12 22:30:54 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking. Maybe it's a newer implementation of open GL as well. They were several versions behind in Yosemite compared to Linux and Windows.
macgaming,3d15lt,OkToBeTakei,6,Sun Jul 12 23:04:57 2015 UTC,"Actually, the entire graphics subsystem has been re-written, based on Metal. Rendering performance, especially, has been dramatically improved, and the whole subsystem is far more efficient in communicating directly with the gpu, even for legacy software."
macgaming,3d15lt,OkToBeTakei,4,Sun Jul 12 23:09:05 2015 UTC,I mean it's night and day performance difference so that makes sense. This has way more excited about Metals potential. I mean even chrome is performing about twice as fast. It's gone from a browser I hated but used anyway to one that I actually love again. It will be interesting to see the performance gains on Metal optimized apps and games.
macgaming,3d15lt,OkToBeTakei,2,Sun Jul 12 23:42:52 2015 UTC,"I can't wait too see... I'm loving gaming on ElC. I'm just a little unhappy with the drop in performance in Beta 3, but I'll live, especially knowing it's just temporary.  Really, though, I've been about to get a new iMac for a little while now, since my gaming performance has been so crappy. This has changed all that. Now my money can go elsewhere."
macgaming,3d15lt,aazel,2,Mon Jul 13 00:53:16 2015 UTC,Ya I was actually considering building a Gaming pc and using it with my iMac in TDM. I holding off on that now as well. Might buy my self a nice mechanical keyboard instead of starting that build.

macgaming,3d15lt,TheBuffaloSeven,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:40:02 2015 UTC,"I thought Metal wasn't an Open GL implementation, but I may be mistaken. Regardless, I can't wait for developers to start coding to it. I'm hoping it's enough like the iOS version of the API that it will be easier for developers to support."
macgaming,3d15lt,TheBuffaloSeven,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:43:54 2015 UTC,It's not. I thought that they were going to use the Metal frame work in conjunction with Open GL. Someone told that was not the case that Metal is now the underlying API for all graphical task. And damn is it a big improvement.
macgaming,3d15lt,edddeduck_feral,2,Mon Jul 13 01:32:26 2015 UTC,"^ Correct, games will only use Metal if they are completely rewritten to use Metal. An already shipping OpenGL game will still use OpenGL just like before."
macgaming,3d15lt,aaabballo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:43:37 2015 UTC,Do you know if they have updated the Open Gl implementation In el Cap? I mean Tomb Raider is running better than ever under El Cap. My max FPS is not any higher but my min seems to be consistently higher.
macgaming,3d15lt,edddeduck_feral,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:33:09 2015 UTC,"Nothing has changed with OpenGL in terms of implementation, there are however a lot of bug fixes, updated drivers and other OS improvements.

You can see why not having good performances in Tomb Raider was a little frustrating. Lol   I really wish they would keep their Open GL implementation up to date. I mean thank god for the bug fixes but their like 5 version behind at this point. I am excited about Metal though."
macgaming,3d15lt,OkToBeTakei,2,Tue Jul 14 13:01:30 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, which games have you tried that you've noticed the big performance gains?"
macgaming,3d15lt,edddeduck_feral,2,Mon Jul 13 06:00:40 2015 UTC,Tomb Raider is a big one. My frame rate used to be all over the place on that game. It also wouldn't run for a couple months. Now it's running flawlessly.   Borderlands 2 is another game that seems to be a lot smoother. I used to not be able to enjoy it at full res but now it's buttery smooth.   Chivalry! I love this game but it always under preformed on Yosemite. Which is weird because it's not that graphically intensive. Now it's frame rate seems to stay pretty high and it plays much more fluid.
macgaming,3d15lt,OkToBeTakei,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:18:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm; I'll have to load up Borderlands 2 again.  I've been meaning to re-install it and finish it.  I noticed what seems like a higher overall framerate in The Talos Principle, but with more hitching than there used to be.  Not necessarily unreasonable in a beta product.  I'll have to check it out in a few others I have installed, like Elite: Dangerous or Satellite Reign.  I seem to be finding myself playing easy-on-the-system games like Nuclear Throne or Crypt of the Necrodancer lately."
macgaming,3d15lt,edddeduck_feral,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:28:08 2015 UTC,There are a few driver updates in the new OS that should fix a number of OS bugs that Apple introduced in Yosemite. I am glad you have gained some added performance back on your Mac!
macgaming,3d15lt,OkToBeTakei,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:37:41 2015 UTC,Do you work for Feral? Can we expect some sexy Metal goodness in the near future? :O
macgaming,3d15lt,edddeduck_feral,3,Wed Jul 15 07:40:35 2015 UTC,Yes I work for Feral.  The Feral logo was shown by Apple when they debuted Metal so we do know about it. We always work hard to make games on the Mac the best they can be and if Metal can help us we will definitely be using it.
macgaming,3d15lt,OkToBeTakei,2,Wed Jul 15 16:37:08 2015 UTC,Are any of you dual-booting or running the beta on a partition?
macgaming,3d15lt,OkToBeTakei,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:03:17 2015 UTC,"It's like I got a new video card, the improvement is so massive. I've decided not to upgrade as a result. That's how much of a performance increase I've experienced. It's goddamned phenomenal!  Edit: less-so with beta 3, but that's because certain elements of Metal are disabled in this release for whatever reason. It's still an amazing boost, but I'm sure it'll be back to full-on boost in beta 4 when Metal is fully-enabled again."
macgaming,3d15lt,OkToBeTakei,2,Sun Jul 12 23:03:08 2015 UTC,"Metal isn't used for any shipping Mac games right now, it might be used under the hood for some UI items in the Finder etc however for a currently shipping game to use Metal it would need to be rewritten from scratch to remove OpenGL and add in Metal."

macgaming,3cz2cu,pescartina,3,Sun Jul 12 02:10:19 2015 UTC,I have a Retina iMac and it handles games including Cities:Skylines fine.
macgaming,3cz2cu,thrash242,3,Sun Jul 12 05:57:00 2015 UTC,"I would say either build a gaming PC or increase your budget and go with a Mac Pro (can confirm it's a great gaming Mac).  I am personally concerned about how high the temperatures gets in the iMac--the cooling system is just not that great. But I'm one voice, look around to see what others say about the temps."
macgaming,3cz2cu,aaabballo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:44:01 2015 UTC,"Kinda late to this thread, but would you say the Mac Pro has better cooling than the Retina iMac? Would a Mac Pro + 4K display be a better option?"
macgaming,3cz2cu,igotmoveslikejagger,2,Fri Jul 17 22:35:02 2015 UTC,"Hi!  Yeah the cooling on the Mac Pro is so much better than on the Retina iMac. The Mac Pro is designed to keep cool.  Like more than half of the whole Mac Pro computer is just a fat heat sink, with a huge fan on top (image).   Under heavy load, like playing BF4 on bootcamp where both GPUs and the CPU are maxed out, the fan on the Mac Pro is at about 60-70% max RPM, while tempuratures never go over 90ºC.   And also here's a reddit post on the Retina iMac having heating issues. The Retina iMac just can't handle heat.  If you can afford it, the Mac Pro with either a 4K or 5K monitor would be the best. It will last a lot longer and the GPU will never throttle down on you due to heat. The second GPU is slowly gaining more support in software, and with the graphics APIs Metal and Vulkan coming up soon, gaming on OSX might beable to use both the Mac Pro's GPUs :D  On Bootcamp with Windows, both the graphics cards run in Crossfire. BF4 on Ultra, 1080p gets about 70fps for me.   Hope that all helps! I don't mean to bash on the Retina iMac; I'm biassed for sure, so note that."
macgaming,3cz2cu,aaabballo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:16:28 2015 UTC,"Awesome post, thank you so much for the answer! This is very helpful. Also, I saw your other post, great to see a fellow Mac-CS GO player :) (although I have to run it on all low settings and 800x600 res right now to get acceptable frame rates, haha)  I'm looking into Mac Pro models right now, seems with the education discount:   Lower end model is $2,799.00 with a 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor, 12GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory, Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM, and 256GB PCIe-based flash storage  Higher end model is $3,699.00 with a 3.5GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor, 16GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory, Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each, and 256GB PCIe-based flash storage  So definitely more expensive, especially with a 4K monitor added on :( Would the base model be enough to get the 70FPS on BF4 Ultra-ish? I'm mostly hoping to be able to play GTA V at acceptable FPS, even 50+FPS at 1080p would be good enough for me.   Like the OP, I've been debating in going with the Retina iMac (or now Mac Pro) and just going with a $1000-1500ish dedicated Windows gaming rig and a MacBook (which I can always hook up to the monitor to get the OS X experience on a larger display)."
macgaming,3cz2cu,igotmoveslikejagger,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:40:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I believe you can get around 60-70fps Ultra-ish in BF4 with the base model. I only guessing because what I did was order the base model with upgraded GPUs. I went with the FirePro D500s instead of the D300s. You can google the differences between the two.   For sure CSGO will run smoothly. I get at least 120fps or more. And with El Capitan coming and the Source 2 engine with Vulkan, holy fps for days. El Capitan overall requires less GPU resources because of Metal being used  for the system, and Source 2 / Vulkan multithread ALL THE THINGS.   But hmmm, money man. Going with a gaming PC and then a MacBook isnt a bad idea. Well, I'll tell you this. Yes, I mostly game on the Mac Pro, but I also use it for some creative work: like video editing with Final Cut Pro X, Motion and other various programs, or using Pixelmatr for editing photos--that made me validate the high price tag.   Best of luck on your decision, and no matter what you go with, you'll be happy with it. :)"

I guess I could have eventually figured out all those things, and it would be easier now that I know about /r/Hackintosh, but I like Macs because I don't have to spend time thinking about them.

I'm on a mobile now (and on vacation), but I'll try to post some good links to guides later so you can see the steps.

You also wouldn't have to go through the hassle of having two devices (not that that's a problem or anything but some people prefer to have 1 device for everything as opposed to 2).   Regarding your last option, seems like that's the one you're hoping to go with and a bit of googling shows a quite a few sources suggesting that a Thunderbolt 3 eGPU is supposed to be coming out in the 4th quarter (atleast the initial products anyway according to this guy).  So I guess it can all come down to how long you're willing to wait."
macgaming,3cz2cu,System0verlord,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:21:26 2015 UTC,Any mac with Thunderbolt 2 can use an external GPU for ~$300 in extra parts and a little bit of work. Bonus: you can use the GPU in OS X. It's essentially a hackintosh without most of the added difficulty.
macgaming,3cz2cu,merrickal,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:24:39 2015 UTC,"if you have to decide now I would go with the second option.

macgaming,3cz2cu,medes24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:27:37 2015 UTC,iMac 5k is a lovely piece of tech that can run games fairly well but it is still not a gaming machine so if you go with it keep in mind that you will be spending thousands more than you need to in order to have a solid gaming device.     The smart move with a $3k budget is to do a $1000-$1500 PC build and use the remainder on your Macbook Pro.
macgaming,3cz2cu,SuperLazyUnicorn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:28:20 2015 UTC,For you I would recommend the gaming PC + 13'' MBP.  Since you're buying a 4K monitor you'll have awesome visuals on your games and if you feel the 13'' monitor is too small you can always hook it up to your 4K monitor. I've got a rMBP 13'' and a Windows PC only for gaming and I think it's perfect for someone who wants to game and get work done.

Feral is intact porting Arkham Knight to OS X and should be out sometime this fall. Considering the majority of Macs have integrated graphics, this seems... Problematic. Arkham Knight is a severely system intensive game, which has apparently lead to it's frequent delays even on PS4. I've read here on Reddit from one of the developers or PR handler that the game takes advantage of Apple's new Metal API in El Capitan, also out this fall.  Should be good timing.   It's my hope the game runs sufficiently at 720p and 30fps on the Intel Iris or 5000 HD line. Should Feral somehow work their wizardry with the new Metal, I think we're in for a treat.

macgaming,3cvpl3,HorseShedShingle,4,Sat Jul 11 04:15:30 2015 UTC,"Woah, I think this author misses a lot of things about the Mac Pro. The only drawback is the price. Here's my thoughts:  The GPU performance is ridiculous, especially for 4 or 5K gaming. These aren't mobile GPUs like on the iMac. They are super stable in high performance. And with Metal and Vulkan coming up, we're be able to use the second GPU as well in games. Not to mention, the GPUs will NEVER overheat.   Both the GPUs and the CPU get amazing cooling. The iMac can overheat on a hot day with no A/C. The Mac Pro will just boost the fan a little higher. Nothing will go over 80ºC under load. I believe the highest GPU for the iMac, the M295x will hit +100Cº easily.   The storage speeds are pure bragging rights. Games load like no other. Holy crap, 1GB/s read and write. Along with the RAM being faster at 1866Mhz.   The Mac Pro is basically a GPU focused computer. It's extremely expensive, which is the only drawback. But it have everything a gamer needs in a computer. Only things needed to seriously label this as a gaming computer are: More games open to OSX, better optimized games for Mac, and both Metal and Vulkan graphics APIs.    I'm an owner of a 2014 Mac Pro w/ AMD D500s."
macgaming,3cvpl3,aaabballo,4,Sat Jul 11 06:06:37 2015 UTC,"I am the author of the article. The Mac Pro is certainly an impressive machine, but I cannot recommend it as a ""best Mac computer for gaming"" due to it having a massive markup over the iMac for very little performance gain. If you look at the benchmarks the 295X solidly beats the D300's in every benchmark:   Geekbench 3: Multi-Core Overall Score - iMac is 14% faster Geekbench 4: Single-Core Overall Score - iMac is 21% faster Left4Dead 2: 1440p, Very High, 4x AA - iMac is 23% faster FurMark: 2560x1440 with no AA - iMac is 5% faster TessMark: 16x 2560x1440 no AA - iMac is 55% faster   This means that the top end iMac is an average of 23.6% faster then the Mac Pro with 3.7 GHz CPU and D300's  I get what you are saying about Vulkan and Metal, but I think given Apple's trackrecord with implementing new/updated graphics API's I wouldn't hold my breath. Apple has always been years behind in OpenGL implementation and I don't see them suddenly making their graphics api a big focus.   Metal will certainly be powerful, but I highly doubt any game will be coded for it. On the Windows side we had Mantle, which could run on every gaming PC with a 7xxx series AMD GPU or newer - which is a lot larger market then the Mac gaming market.   Even Mantle struggled to find support and has now been canceled. It can be argued that Mantle's main purpose was to motivate the more popular API's to have better performance and it did (both DX12 and Vulkan are huge improvements over DX11 and OpenGL). Many of Mantle's main features made it into Vulkan  EDIT: Found some benchmarks of the Mac Pro with 8 Core 3.0 GHz and D700's vs the iMac 5K with 4 GHz CPU and 295X. The Mac Pro with D700's performs 3.3% faster on average across all of the benchmarks. To put that into perspective the Mac Pro with 8 Core 3.0 GHz and D700's costs $6,099 compared to the top end iMac which costs $2800 and comes with a beautiful 27"" 5K monitor.   Technically speaking you could get the top end iMac with 4 GHz CPU and M295X and then get an external GPU enclosure with a Titan X (fastest single GPU on the market) and you would still save about $1500 compared to getting the top end Mac Pro and the Titan X would destroy it in gaming.  EDIT 2: I want to point out that I do not think the Mac Pro is a bad computer. I will copy and paste what I said about it in the article:   The Mac Pro is a similar to a powerful Clydesdale horse, while a gaming computer is like a race horse. Both types of horses are fast/powerful in their own way, but they have completely different strengths and uses."
macgaming,3cvpl3,clutchfoot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:24:10 2015 UTC,I'm thinking about bankrupting myself for a couple of years and getting one of these. Which processor and memory options did you go for? Do you now find yourself wishing you'd gone for an upgraded option?
macgaming,3cvpl3,dagbrown,3,Sat Jul 11 12:22:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not /u/aaabballo but I also got myself a Mac Pro.  I got the base CPU and base GPU, and 16G of RAM just to make sure all of the memory slots were filled up.  I'm completely happy with it, and couldn't think of any way that getting more computer would satisfy my needs any more than it currently does.  The load I put on my system is more CPU- and memory-bound than GPU-bound though--running virtual machines, for instance.  Don't buy one though.  It's been nearly two years since they were released.  Odds are very good that Apple's about to, if nothing else, bump the specs on the machine.  I know mine feels like it's still a brand-new computer, but that's more a testament to how good it was in the first place.  It's a machine which is just shy of two years old, and they can (and should!) do better.  Keep your money in your wallet for the moment.  Another thing to remember is that the GPUs in the Mac Pro are optimised more for precision than for speed.  A gamer GPU is optimised for greater speed at the expense of not always getting all of its numbers right, which is unacceptable for a workstation GPU.  The market Apple is aiming at with the Mac Pro isn't the gamer market so much as it is the market which used to buy high-end UNIX workstations to run AutoCAD on.  With that in mind, I had to crank the resolution for many games down to 2560x1440 in order to get a proper 60fps frame rate (and Spec Ops: The Line refuses to deal with 4K at all, but I'm almost entirely certain the issue is with the game rather than with the hardware it's running on, judging by its debugging logs)."
macgaming,3cvpl3,clutchfoot,2,Sat Jul 11 13:41:04 2015 UTC,"This is a great answer, thanks. With a decent Mac Pro costing as much as a car, I'm not rushing into any decisions.

macgaming,3cvpl3,dagbrown,2,Sat Jul 11 14:47:44 2015 UTC,"I can tell you I haven't regretted getting a Mac Pro.  It does have one thing going for it: odds are you won't need to buy another computer for years and years and years afterwards.  I noticed that I ran my computers into the ground, and didn't bother getting a new one until the old one was hopelessly obsolete.  With that in mind, I'm not expecting to get a new computer for quite a long time, which nicely justifies the expense of getting my Mac Pro.  That said, I use mine for more than just gaming.  It's probably worth building yourself a nice little gaming rig for a modest amount of money and pocketing the difference, if that's what you're into. And hey, building PCs is pretty good fun!  When you look at what goes into a Mac Pro, though, it honestly is the best value for money out there.  Just try to part together a PC with even close to the same specs and you'll see what I mean."
macgaming,3cvpl3,aaabballo,2,Sat Jul 11 14:59:01 2015 UTC,"I would try to upgrade the GPU if you can. The D300's are ok, but the D500 and D700 are both significant steps up from eachother, and its not like you can upgrade the GPU in the future with the new Mac Pro.  The iMac with M295X outperforms the D300's, so you'll want to step up to at least the D500, preferably the D700."
macgaming,3cvpl3,redthorne,2,Sat Jul 11 15:05:40 2015 UTC,"I got the Quad 3.7Ghz, D500s, and 16GBs RAM. I use it for creative work as well as gaming, which is how I justified the price.

macgaming,3cpftl,iLoveHouseMusic,2,Thu Jul 9 18:43:09 2015 UTC,"The Mac client is still listed as being a beta and requires literally double the RAM the PC requires. When I started playing a few months ago, it ran so poorly (by my standards) I just cleared 25 gigs of space on my Windows partition and installed it there.   But for what it's worth, it runs well on my partition. I set it pretty low to get +70 fps in regular play (I value frame-rate over graphics), but with similar specs you could probably get a stable 30-50 on medium.  GW2 is the best MMO I've ever played, and I say that having played WoW for more than a year, maxing 2 toons.   The combat is miles beyond WoW, playing more like an action game. Unless you're grinding in a lower zone, it's an involved process that requires you to dodge and juke and combo. The world feels way more alive, with its dynamic events and emerging bosses.  Questing is basically the same, but doesn't require you to backtrack to return.  You unlock the skins of everything you equip and can apply that skin to other equipment, so you don't have to choose between ugly/good armor and pretty/bad armor. Classes are more versatile. In WoW, the Warrior is just a melee class. In GW2, all ""professions"" have their own perfectly legitimate  melee and ranged weapons.   Other things can either be good or bad, depending on your preference.    You more options for leveling in that you can earn a large amount of XP from discovering vistas, locations, and skill challenges as opposed to depending on quests. However, unless you want to horde and spam level boosts (which isn't difficult to do), you'll *need to collect otherwise you'll be under-leveled. Speaking of leveling, you get temporarily downleveled when you're in an area that's lower than you. My Ranger is 80, but when he's in Queensdale he is scaled down to 15. I like it because it makes grinding less boring, but I wish I could turn it off. You share money and bank space between toons. Good for swapping xp/level boosts and raw crafting materials between characters, but you'll pretty much have to buy a bank expansion if you're a packrat.  GW2 doesn't follow the typical MMO group rules (dps/tank/healer). Instead, you'll have to learn a different system: Damage, Control, Support. However, every profession can Damage.

macgaming,3cjrz3,Bigardo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:20:58 2015 UTC,Your Mac has an Intel Iris Pro graphics solution that is not designed for games. However have you lowered your resolution? In most cases lowering resolution will give you a large boost and it is something some people miss as it is not technically a graphics option.  Good luck.

I have to say h/w failure is very rare in my experience, we run games all day everyday on pretty much every model of Macbook, MacbookAir and MacbookPro for over a decade and we have never had any issues with machine dying due to overheating related damage. We are based in the UK so ambient temperatures are not as high as the tropics for example.  We have had a few fail over the years but always usually within warranty for a known issue for example the early rMBP has a known issue with the quality of the solder on the GPU that causes GPU failures.  The swelling battery issue is usually caused by other factors than high heat (I'm not saying high heat won't be a factor or make the issue worse once it happens) but the primary driver of battery is unlikely to be the heat levels of the rest of the laptop.  That all said the best advice I have is don't worry about heat however don't ignore or abuse your machine. Keep it well ventilated, don't play games with the laptop on your bed or on a cushion for example as those will absorb heat and reduce ventilation."

CrossOver is slightly more user-friendly, but is paid software whereas Wine is free. You can get a trial (and even make it an endless trial), but it usually doesn't work much better than Wineskin, and it limits your access to what often ends up being some important advanced settings you need to access.  I can upload a wrapper to help simplify it a little, but you'll have to install the game & possibly install a no-CD patch."

Cannot at all say whether it will work, but I've tried to give it most-likely settings, considering I cannot find info on this game, which is pretty weird. Lol.  To install something: Download and unzip the wrapper (The Unarchiver can handle zip/unzip and most other de/compression, if you don't already have something). Move the wrapper to your desktop for ease of use while testing. Right click the wrapper, choose ""Show Package Contents"", and open Wineskin.app within the folder will pop up. Press ""Install Software"", then ""Choose Setup Executable"", and navigate to the setup CD for the game, and then find the setup or install "".exe"" program which will install the game. If it asks to install DirectX at any point (watch very carefully), say NO. A native Windows DirectX  install may break Wine's implementation of DX which will likely cause Wine or game crashes, or replacing DX could cause severe performance issues (lag, bad rendering of game's graphics).  Edit: typo."

Leaking even hazy speculation about projects/when they are going to be ready gets companies in trouble all the time these days, but has to be done to keep people interested. So they have officially turned the whole ""what are we getting next and when??"" into a bit of a game/joke.   They want to balance hinting at what is coming down the pipeline eventually with not really knowing how development and priorities are going to turn out, or wanting to be tied to firm deadlines so early in any way. So now a radar bubble that was a way off anyway goes back one ring and another teaser comes forward a little and people are all ""ooooh, look at the radar shifting, what do you think that new vague title/image are referring to, so exciting!"" rather than ""YOU IMPLIED THAT X MIGHT BE READY BY NOW HOW DARE YOU PUT IT ON THE BACK BURNER TO CONCENTRATE ON SOME OTHER PROJECT???"""

macgaming,3bt8xm,Captain_Z,3,Thu Jul 2 03:00:46 2015 UTC,"Your system is far from being a piece of shit, but it is long in the tooth, which makes it less than optimal for gaming. Let's go through each part:   3.06GHz Intel Core 2 Duo - The Core 2 series processor is a venerable series, and fully capable of running Mac OS X right up through 10.11 El Capitan. The speed isn't the issue, it's the lack of cores: only having 2 cores instead of 4 or 8 available (as with the i5 or i7) puts it at a minor disadvantage for some gaming stuff. 4GB of DDR3 memory - 4GB is a good starting point, however these days it's a minimum. I'd recommend dumping a 4GB stick if possible to get it up if you plan to continue using it. Your system maxes out at 16GB. nVidia GeForce 9400 - The GeForce series has been around a long time, and the 9400 is now 5 generations old. This is your major bottleneck for gaming, and you can't upgrade it (it's integrated on motherboard). 256MB is not a large amount, considering many modern graphics cards are packing 1-6GB of GDDR5 memory at much higher clock rates. Mac OS X 10.9.5 - Mavericks was a semi-problematic version for me, but your experience may have been better than mine. Yosemite introduces some improvements to things like speed and OpenGL, so it may be worth examining if you want to try updating your OS. It's a free download from the Mac App Store if you decide to.   So, if you plan on using it for gaming, don't expect much. The graphics being non-upgradable is your weak point, however there are a few things you can do to improve things (add memory, upgrade OS). Consider looking around for a more modern iMac or Mac Pro system soon though, as you will likely run into the problems you describe more and more, especially as newer games are released with even steeper system requirements."

Dota 2 is a MOBA, but the Reborn Beta on OSX uses Vulkan, which is simular to Apple's Metal, allowing the game to run better on older laptops due to reducing the CPU bottleneck and overall optimizing performance.

macgaming,3bsdm3,averge,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:05:58 2015 UTC,"FFXIV is good, but you'll need to play it in Bootcamp at the moment. The official Mac client gives terrible framerates (< 20 FPS), even on high end machines. One day that may be fixed, but steer clear for now.   GW2 is excellent and only needs a box purchase to play.  The gameplay and lore of LOTRO are great, but the graphics are extremely dated, particularly at the earlier levels.  Wan't taken with ESO myself (it seemed a little dull to me), but then I wasn't massive fan of the other Elder Scrolls games either.  Overall, after WOW (which is still the best native Mac MMO), I'd say try GW2 next if you want to avoid Bootcamp, or FFXIV if you're happy to re-boot into Windows for your gaming sessions."

macgaming,3bojbe,tommmytom,2,Tue Jun 30 21:38:16 2015 UTC,"Alternatives are either Wine-based or require a Windows install. Did you check out appdb.winehq.org? Usually has compatibility ratings and sometimes has installation notes. portingteam.com may have a wrapper for the game already made, and - if so -  could have directions on dealing with this bug.  The game is DirectX 9.0, and could possibly run on a modern phone (requires 256MB RAM, 64MB gfx, 1.5GHz processor), so there's no real reason other than incompatibility that it shouldn't run.  Have you tried playing with the settings in the wrapper? Right click->Show Package Contents->run Wineskin.app, go to Screen Options and change ""Use Mac Driver instead of X11"" and then try to run it. If that still runs the same you could try some settings in Wineskin-> Advanced->Config Utility (winecfg), under the Graphics tab [probably least likely to help], or others in Screen Options [most likely to help]. Changing the Wine engine used can also effect compatibility - what one are you using? It displays it in the Wineskin->Advanced window near the bottom, or in Wineskin->Advanced->Tools->Change Engine used. Also, settings that work for one version of the Wine engine may not work with others.  Because of the insanely low requirements it could be worth trying in a virtual machine - they take a lot of RAM and CPU power compared to Wine products, but usually support the necessary functionality for everything (depending on which virtualization option you choose - VirtualBox, VMware Fusion, Parallels). But, if you have a Windows install and making your Mac dual-boot doesn't sound bad, BootCamp + a Windows install would likely give the best results."
macgaming,3bojbe,l3l_aze,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:03:37 2015 UTC,"I downloaded a wrapper from portingteam.com since I still cannot get it to work on Steam, should be compatible and tried all the tips on appdb. Anyway, I have no idea how to use the wrapper - sorry, I'm just new to all of this! I looked at the engine, which is WS9WineCX12.1.2, wrapper version is Wineskin 2.5.10. When I click test run under Advanced -> Configuration, it runs for less than a second and ""Test Run Complete!"" pops up. I did, however, notice that the pathway (/Program Files/LucasArts/Star Wars Battlefront II/GameData/BattlefrontII.exe) doesn't work - when I click browse and go into ""Program Files"", it only has ""Common Files"" and ""Internet Explorer"" in it. Thanks for your help though, I appreciate it a lot!"
macgaming,3bojbe,l3l_aze,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:45:31 2015 UTC,"No problem :) I know how hard Wineskin can be, lol.Hmm. Wineskin is up to version 2.6.0, and the latest CX (CrossOver) engine is 14.0.0, that could be a part of the issue.  Wineskin in the wrapper can be updated by opening the wrapper (right click, show package contents) and then running Wineskin.app and going to Advanced->Tools->Update Wrapper (and I think then press OK - mine is latest version, so it's a different dialog with ""Update"" and ""Don't Update""), and wait.  To update the engine: Run the system version of Wineskin.app (not the wrapper's), and press the + to add an Engine, then pick CX14.0.0 from the list and press ""Download and Install"". Once finished, close the system's Wineskin and open the wrapper's Wineskin, then go to Advanced->Tools->Change Engine Used and pick CX14 from the list, then press OK and wait. It will run the program the wrapper is setup for (if any), and you'll have to close the wrapper to get it to continue with the engine change. You can right click the wrapper on the launchpad and press quit, or if it's running Steam right click it's icon and press Exit, or Force Quit it via CMD + Option + Esc (select it from the list and hit ""Force quit"").  Updating won't guarantee it will work, but the newer engine should be more compatible with the game, and newer wrapper should be better at doing it's part.  Updating the system wrapper shouldn't effect the portingteam wrapper you have, but changing the engine in the wrapper definitely would. Your best bet would likely be to update the system's Wineskin wrapper, download latest CX engine, and create a new wrapper (via system's Wineskin) with the CX14 engine.  Did you already install Steam in the wrapper? If so, it should have a C:\Program Files\Steam folder.  Edit: paulthetall has a wrapper for Steam + SWBF 2. Might be easier; never really used his, but I think I tried and failed once."
macgaming,3bojbe,l3l_aze,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:36:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying! By system version of Wineskin, I assume you mean (what's called on my Mac) ""Wineskin Winery""? I clicked on the +, although CX14.0.0 does not show up - each item in the list starts with ""WS9Wine"" or ""WS8Wine"". Updating the Wineskin version to 2.6.0, however, did work. Also, if I can update the engine, it may work then, however when I attempted to install Steam on the BF wrapper (noticed I didn't; running through winetricks), I got this error: sha1sum mismatch!  Rename /Users/thomas/.cache/winetricks/steam/SteamSetup.exe and try again. Is there something specific it is supposed to be renamed to? Thanks."
macgaming,3bojbe,l3l_aze,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:05:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, Winery; sorry. CX is at the very bottom of the list, lol; sorry meant to say that. I actually just found it the other day myself, and have only been using WS9 engines for months =))  You could try updating Winetricks with the Update Winetricks button at the bottom of it's window, and then try installing Steam through Winetricks again. That error is a bug, and I think there's a workaround but I never got it to work if there is, lol. Another option is SteamInstall.msi; this is what worked for me.  Note: if text doesn't display in Steam, that's a known bug with a workaround: open Wineskin and go to Advanced->Tools, open Config Utility (winecfg), and go to the Libraries tab. In the box labeled 'New override for library:' type ""dwrite"" (without quotes), and then press Add. Next, make sure dwrite is selected and press Edit, then select Disable from the dialog and press OK,  Apply, OK.  Tip: Exit Wineskin by pressing the X at the top left of the window. When I quit it with cmd + q, or Force Quit, or by right clicking the wrapper on launchpad->quit it tends to not save settings changes..which can lead to some very frustrating wrapper testing.  Grabbed a copy of the game; not quite the same, but I'm also on 10.9.5 so hopefully we'll be able to get it to work if it can."

How can I install Steaminstall.msi?; the link you provided doesn't exist, unfortunately. Would it be a custom command, i.e. winetricks Steaminstall.msi? Once again - thank you, appreciating all of this."
macgaming,3bojbe,l3l_aze,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:53:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Lol, yeah; pretty sure WS is for Wineskin, dunno what 9 means, and the Wine#.#.# at the end is the version of Wine being used at the base of WS.  Nice work! I hate that error, a lot, lol. MSI files are installers, all you should have to do is: Run Wineskin in the wrapper & press ""Install Software"", ""Choose Setup Executable"". To simplify finding it you can drag and drop the Steaminstall.msi file into the file picker. With the MSI file selected press ""Choose"" and it should open and install. After it finishes select ""Steam.exe"" from the list to set it as the program to run upon wrapper startup. The sha1sum error has happened with this installer too, but I'm re-he-heally hoping it works.  Sorry about link; SwiftKey keyboard app for Android sucks!! Screws up more typing than it really helps with..gonna find a new one after this message. Lol. Fixed link: SteamInstall.msi. Capital I vs lowercase i in ""Install"" - within the actual link - was the issue. Lol. Also fixed link above, in previous post.  I don't know if there is a way to do custom Winetricks, but if so it would likely require deep knowledge of Wine itself. They're meant to help install things that normally won't, and workaround some bugs; and there are some advanced Wine settings buried in there, too.  And, you're welcome :) Just want it to work for you! I know the feeling of missing a game, it's how I got started (GTA SA). Lol.  Edit: the wrapper I used for SWBF 2. I disabled dwrite already, so Steam should be easy to install. Also had an icon from wrapper that came with the version I grabbed, so that's also setup. I should've done this after testing earlier.

The UI in OSX separates games from the system completely, so when or if the game crashes, you can still tab out or minimize the game and go back the desktop without having to restart the computer. At least in most cases of my experience, this is what happens. OSX is more stable in this respect.

Consider instead moving some data from your Mac drive to the external and boot camp direct on the internal.   Disk Inventory for Mac can also help you find where your disk is being used so you can find those big files which can be archived to USB. I run it regularly and am amazed at how much crap I leave lying around ;)"

I actually use Disk Inventory as well, but I only have a 120GB drive on my Mac, so that's not really much to split between two operating systems.  Also the external drive I will use is an USB3.0 SSD, which is only marginally slower than the internal drive. Do you think that will be ok to run off of?"

macgaming,3bclwi,edddeduck_feral,2,Sun Jun 28 04:09:17 2015 UTC,Don't know of any games that suffer from this directly.   I know Mouse drivers on the Mac can add a delay into the system especially under high load (including SmoothMouse). Usually any slight lag is tied to the engine slowing now not the round trip loop on the mouse.  All things like Smooth mouse and other drivers do is make the acceleration curves closer to Windows as the difference of long time windows gamers can be off-putting. I'd guess this is more likely what you are experiencing.

The Mac version of Psychonauts is apparently just a Cider or Wine port, so it's really just the Windows version underneath. Will check for a way to turn on compatibility mode for a program in Wine, but it's doubtful. Would likely be easier to make a new Wineskin wrapper and hope the updates will fix the issues.  There was mention of an unofficial 1.05 or 1.0.5 patch for the program - any idea which version you're running? And what's your OS X version?"

To tell if it's a Wineskin or Cider version: go to the Psychonauts app in /steam/steamapps/, right click and go to ""Show Package Contents"". If there's a Wineskin.app in there skip this next part, otherwise continue: Go to ""Contents"" and look in a folder named ""MacOS"" for a file named cider.  If it's a Cider port, you'd likely be better off with a Wineskin version. If it's a Wineskin version go and open Wineskin.app and go to ""Advanced"" then ""Tools"". Press ""Add Program"" and select + ""Open"" the Psychonauts program (.exe), which should be in the Program Files folder. After it's added go to the Windows Version selector at the bottom of the current tab and change ""Use Global settings"" to ""Windows 95"".  Press ""Apply"" and then ""Ok"" to save the settings and hopefully it will work.  If Steam is installed in the wrapper with the game instead of somehow running the game from native Mac Steam, then the game program should be in Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Psychonauts.  Edit: I asked which version of OS X because some versions of Cider/Wineskin wrappers have issues running on newer versions of Mac. It could just be an issue with that, in which case making a new wrapper may fix it."
macgaming,3b6x4e,l3l_aze,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:32:11 2015 UTC,I could find neither the Wineskin.app or the cider file. I think Double Fine might have released a native port of Psychonauts.

Off the top of my head, Vulkan hasn't even been finalized yet and there is no way for a vendor to ship official support for it.  Edit: Also, both Unreal and Unity feature Metal renderers, so games built on them will essentially get it ""for free"". And for games it's not going to be a huge deal regardless - you already have to port DirectX games to OpenGL to get them working on OS X, and it's going to be far easier to port to Metal than the versions of OpenGL supported by Apple. The guy who added support for Metal to Unity wrote some thoughts about it up a while back that are well worth reading."
macgaming,3b35ok,lgroeni,3,Thu Jun 25 16:46:25 2015 UTC,"Metal for iOS is apparently built into Unreal Engine 4. That's a pretty good start IMO, and I would expect support for Metal for OSX to follow suit. I can't remember where I read it, but apparently the shader instructions for Metal are similar to those of OpenGL, which should help a lot too.  Edit: Actually what am I on about? Epic showed Fortnite, which is running on the Unreal engine. So there's definitely support for Metal built into Unreal."
macgaming,3b35ok,magnakai,2,Thu Jun 25 16:30:56 2015 UTC,"Apple did Metal before Vulkan was even announced, so that's why you have only heard about Metal on iOS and (maybe?) OSX.  That said, the whole purpose of Vulkan is to provide a fully cross-platform solution while maintaining a more low-level approach, so it will work on OSX, and very likely iOS as well."

What is the state of your realm/the rest of the world when it slows down? I'm curious as to whether this is something to do with your computer, or if it's the game itself.  I know that CK2 can often have issues if there are large numbers of units on the map, so if you have a lot of armies just sitting around that may be the cause for some of it. Multiple ongoing wars between the AI can also cause issues. I also want to say having a large number of characters in your court can cause issues, although I'm not 100% sure on that. I know that EU4 definitely has these sorts of issues late-game, regardless of computer specs, so I'm curious if it's just this (since they both use the same engine)."

macgaming,3b3vrw,kracksundkatzen,4,Thu Jun 25 20:48:26 2015 UTC,"Mac/Linux port was being made by Feral Interactive, and they typically make fairly good ports. The PC port was handled by Iron Galaxy, which has a mixed history with porting. The Mac port was already delayed prior to the PC version being pulled, stating that they were going to release it in the Fall and that they weren't going to release until they were satisfied with the state of the port (whereas the PC port was released in an unfinished state because the publisher insisted on a simultaneous release between Consoles and PC). At least, that's what I've been able to gleam from other discussions on this topic."

macgaming,3b26py,Centropomus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:38:11 2015 UTC,I'm not very well informed on this — but I've heard that Civ relies heavily on the CPU for its performance and the GPU isn't that important. Maybe the CPU is just marginally better than your old MacBook's?
macgaming,3b26py,shimafuci,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:59:08 2015 UTC,"Mmm don't think so.  The mbp 2011 was an Intel Core i7-2635QM 2.0 GHz (Sandy bridge), while the new one has 2.2 GHz (i7-4770HQ) quad-core Intel Core i7 Haswell.  Should be way more faster imho"
macgaming,3b26py,edddeduck_feral,2,Thu Jun 25 15:25:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of turn ending calculations have to be serial as they all have knock on consequences meaning they cannot be calculated in parallel, this means clock speed becomes a key factor in performance in these games compared to overall performance.  I suspect that Civ is like other similar turn based games (for example Total War is one I have worked on) meaning the added 200 MHz in clock speed is the major factor in end-turn performance not the CPU design. This translates a smaller overall change in end turn performance compared to the bigger leap in graphics performance between the models.  Finally as Blair mentioned the end turn pause is a common thing at the end of large strategy games on all platforms due to the much larger number of AI calculations needed when the world map is fully populated."

macgaming,3axdiw,Dirty_Socks,16,Wed Jun 24 07:28:30 2015 UTC,"There's nooooo way I would void the warranty on this guy! I could only imagine what an out of warranty repair would be lmfao  So,  I set up DSR through Nvidia's control panel to simulate a 4k environment on the 1080p display hooked up to my gaming rig.   I then used a crossover cable to connect the PC to the Mac. Also had to set up a secondary network so I could have Internet access via wifi but still have the two machines on a physical LAN.   Then I had to change some settings in steam on both machines to use the hardware to help encode the stream.   Then it's just using steams in home sharing to stream the game from the PC to the Mac.   The hardest parts were figuring out DSR so I could have my GPU push out a 4K stream while being hooked up to a 1080p display and figuring out the networking portion. WiFi just isn't strong enough to handle that stream (it has nothing to do with your internet speed). It's just about getting the fastest network between the two machines.   But that's really it!"

macgaming,3axdiw,GnuRip,2,Wed Jun 24 23:14:46 2015 UTC,So the Steam client is super easy to configure. Open up Steam Preferences --> In Home Sharing --> advanced and there should be an option to use hardware to encode. Just do that on both machines.   You don't need to run boot camp or any special software for this to work! You just need to install the free Steam client on both computers.

Now, if you actually want to play the game free from scratch, well you're going to be immensely crippled by lack of hotbars and various useful features that everyone else has."
macgaming,3apxsq,darkprophecies,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:51:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah my bad I was being a dick I forgot about the other stuff they take away.   For anyone reading, and feel free to add on here or correct me this is all from memory, this is a list of what they restrict when you're not a sub:  1) limited class xp (idk by how much)  2) limited raid access (I think its only like 3-4 raids per week)  3) limited guild access (you can join a guild, but can't access features like the guild vault)  4) no character or guild titles  5) limited to two characters  6) limited cosmetics (can't unify colors, can't use dyes?)  7) limited race choice  8) you cant use artifact level items unless you buy them from the cartel market  I think there might be some other stuff but I forget.  if you don't want to buy a sub, most of that stuff can be bought using cartel coins in the market  personally what I do is buy the sub for like a 3 month period, which is like $45. I get the full experience for a good amount of time, and I feel my payment has been justified.  I can't testify to how it was when you played, but now its pretty good. I just got back into it, but afaik if you buy the sub then the only microtransactions are for some armor and weapons."

This time, we need your help to test GoD Factory on Mac.  Nine Dots Studio is a small studio of 6 developers and we are lacking the funds to hire a QA team and/or buy Mac PCs to test the game.   GoD Factory is a competitive space combat game where each team defends a 13km long Carrier from the other one. You assemble your gunships from around 12 different parts according to the role you want to play in your team.   If you are interested in helping us find bugs and report them so we can fix them, we will be happy to provide you keys that you can activate via Steam. Let me know if you are in and I’ll send you a key via private message. Thank you for your time :)"

Edit: I think it's ""kextunload <path to .kext file>"" (no quotes). The kext file should be in /Library/Extensions  https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/kextunload.8.html  Edit 2: Oh, and it won't work again until you reboot or load the kext again via the terminal (""kextload <path to .kext>"").

macgaming,3a97nd,zlei,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:22:08 2015 UTC,"There is at least one third party player, but no official OS support for playback."
macgaming,3a9cq1,l3l_aze,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:58:19 2015 UTC,I had to Bootcamp to play it.  Any other method to run it involved trading stability. If I was you I'd grab the windows 10 preview and Bootcamp.
macgaming,3a9pf5,twantheswan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:00:51 2015 UTC,"Well, if it didn't support DirectX 11 and GTAV requires it, it would fail to launch.    I think the culprit here is that GTA V is simply more demanding hardware wise than IV, optimized or not.  The MBP processor is limited in what it can handle inside a laptop shell (heat) so when you add emulating an OS to the pile (Parallels) it's a heavy workload.  It may even be throttling itself down due to this, making for even worse performance.  Remember, GTAV on PC has been upgraded for the stronger hardware of PC/XBO/PS4 release vs. the 360/PS3 original.  Comparing it to IV now doesn't make sense.  Seems like Bootcamp would be the best solution for you here.  I wish it wasn't necessary but it's what we have."
macgaming,3a9pf5,Lateraleye,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:54:23 2015 UTC,Well it also supports directx 10 so i don't think that's the problem. But I was hoping that there could be a solution without bootcamp.
macgaming,3a9pf5,macgrver,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:13:36 2015 UTC,First I would try to install geforce experience and see if the auto optimization fixes the freezing and what not. I'm very uncertain that will fix it however just due to the performance of games running in any virtualization software. If you truly just want smoother consistent frame rates then boot camp is the way to go.
macgaming,3a9pf5,macgrver,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:58:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I will be trying this!  The graphics card in my computer is an amd card so I don't think it will work with that program, but it won't hurt to try.  Edit: yeah, it won't work."
macgaming,3a9pf5,Airglow26,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:12:37 2015 UTC,Sorry I forgot the new Macbook Pros had AMD cards instead of Nvidia ones. Lucky AMD also has a game optimization program called AMD Gaming Evolved Client. I would give that a try in Parallels and if that doesn't work I would just switch over to duel-booting and running GTA V in Bootcamp.

macgaming,3a6t1h,mahler004,2,Thu Jun 18 04:13:29 2015 UTC,"Total War: Shogun 2 is an older game (Total War is the actual name of the game series, so I guess it would be Total War: Rome 2 fyi) and it runs rather choppy on my 2013 macbook air.   The problem as I surmise it is that when you go into a battle, like the tutorial battle they usually have in the beginning of Total War games, the simulation is so huge with so many little pieces that you have to set everything to pretty much the lowest setting to get it to run in any kind of satisfying manner. The overworld stuff worked pretty much fine, so you could conceivably play through a Total War game by letting the battles auto resolve (which is how I used to love to play Total War: Rome when I was a teenager because I sucked at rts as a 12 year old).   I guess the answer depends on how important the simulated rts battles are to you. They probably look and play a lot better than the first Rome."

This is basically the ""off"" setting that SmoothMouse sets when you turn it on.   This is just my preference. Yours will depend on the type of mouse you have and how you like your mouse to feel."

I will also say that, for comparison's sake I have a 2010 MBA with a 320M, which is basically the same card with double the shaders, and source engine titles like portal can run at essentially their lowest settings on my MBA but I can run them at their highest, and native retina resolution on the MBP.

The games are AMAZING and 100% worth playing.  They're huge, extremely fun, and for some reason the guy who made them keeps remaking them.  They started out as Exile 1, 2, and 3.  Then he remade them into Avernum 1, 2, and 3.  Then he made sequels, Avernum 4, 5, and 6.  Then he re-remade Avernum 1 and 2 (I haven't played the reremake of 2 yet, but I've played the other... 10, holy shit).  They're really great games, and you can disable background sounds if you need (there's some music in the intro screen but that's it).  The first... many are completely turn-based.  I'm not sure about 5, but I think from 6 on the enemies move even when you don't, but battle mode is definitely turn-based no matter what.  Anyway, I very, very highly recommend these games.  They're Mac originals!"

It is the first game in the Baldur's Gate series, and takes place in the Forgotten Realms, a high fantasy campaign setting, using a modified version of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) 2nd edition rules. The game received critical acclaim and was credited for revitalizing the computer role-playing game genre. The game allows development of the player character through choice of companions, dialogue choice, exploration, and battle. Baldur's Gate uses a reputation system, and rewards the player depending on the choices made in the game.

macgaming,39xq0j,John-Wick,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:51:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, mine goes crazy with DotA2, and can't even really run CS:GO.  The DLC gives you access to two more companions, so it mostly depends on what you want your team to be like. I wanted to have one of my main characters as a rogue and one as a tank/warrior. The two companions the base game gives are a tank/warrior and a Mage. The DLC gives you a ranger and a rogue. I like the Ranger and the Mage for my party, because my main characters are both melee. You could easily make a ranger/rogue hybrid character and wouldn't need either of the DLC characters, so it's up to what you like in characters mostly. I don't recall if it adds any new quests or locations, so you may want to look into that."

It was very playable although the fan on the laptop was going strong.  I still need to tweak the settings a little bit to see how far i can push it.  With my current kind of medium settings I was able to run it at 30fps.  When I first got the game however, I pumped up every single setting to max and as you guessed it was pretty unplayable and laggy. If you do go this route you'll need a normal mouse.  My apple mouse was causing issues with firing because of the single click button design.  Good luck with your journey to save up for it.   This machine is one hell of a purchase and I hope it lasts me at least 5-7 years."
macgaming,39ztk9,codemstr,2,Tue Jun 16 07:58:04 2015 UTC,"It would be pretty damn good!  The main problem is it can't be upgraded, but that's par for the course with laptops.  That and the cost is high - you can't upgrade things like the RAM either and Apple charges a premium for those upgrades.  Do yourself a favor and look up some benchmarks.  There might even be GTA V benchmarks.  You'd be in great shape if you decide to spend your money this way.  Personally I'm less likely to want to play demanding games on a laptop and will wait for home, so I would focus on desktop for gaming rig.  But there's no reason why you can't play demanding games on a maxed rMBP, it will do a good job for existing games and probably for several years to come."

Edit: Looking at the current price again, maybe not…    To be honest, I'm not totally sure what most of the benchmarks mean :/ And believe me, I've tried to find GTA V benchmarks.

It also plays elite dangerous at 1080p with settings on high between 30 and 50 fps (under Yosemite, with boot camp it runs faster)  Arma 3 plays well too.   Dying light chugs a bit."

I got it for school because the software worked with no problems, and it had a great battery life."
macgaming,39ztk9,Blmlozz,2,Tue Jun 16 14:01:47 2015 UTC,"The answer depends on your definition of 'good' The 2014 750M GT is a slower ''mid'' level discrete card with 2GB of DDR5 Vram and 384 Cuda cores. 'barely adequate' comes to mind as a descriptor. Unfortunately it only real advantage it has over the IGP is dedicated vram, stronger compute, and a better driver package which is enough to give it a significant edge over the IGP for professional video/photo applications but that degree of improvement doesn't translate to gaming, even though it's a discrete card it's around 10-20% better than the IGP. It's the only MBP that can play Skylines, but that's simply because it's not an Intel card. The new AMD based card is an actually pretty decent improvement over the 750M, but again, at the price point Apple is asking for it, it's simply a drastically underpowered card with what would be considered a 'small' amount of Vram. particularly for something like GTA V  Compared to windows based laptops? It's really not even a contest. Even with the 2015 refresh, the rMBP 15"" is underpowered and overpriced as a gaming machine. Apple has done well in curbing the 'apple tax' on desktops compared to similar windows machines but their laptops are really not on the same planet. Every competing windows based machine I can think of (in the boutique gaming laptop market) does it better(in the realm of 500-700% more GPU performance), for cheaper.  For the $2499 apple is asking for an R9 370MX equipped mac, an Alienware 15 is packing a 980M, faster processor, better LCD panel, more storage and equivalent features otherwise, with expandability for $100 less, and Dell is famous for being able to haggle a bit more off that . If ultra portability is your thing, again the Razer Blade is a much more complete package with better hardware for a much better price/performance ratio."

macgaming,39t8ur,XJ-0461,2,Sun Jun 14 18:08:02 2015 UTC,I would seriously recommend upgrading the graphics card running a 5k screen with 2GB of VRAM causes serious performance issues with the very latest high end games as the native resolution is so high.  You'll be fine for the games you list as they are relatively old/not as taxing but the 4GB model will have a longer gaming lifespan.

If you're planning to get a new computer in the near future it might still worth be buying because it will probably not go back down to this price until the fall steam sale, otherwise it would be better to leave it alone.  I have it installed on my other computer but I will download onto my Macbook air (intel HD4000) and I'll let you know how it runs."

Playing in windowed mode at 1920x1080 with otherwise default graphic settings and the game runs fine for the most part... but if I have a text-overlay up, like from clicking on the building, it really stutters a lot.   It's playable but not great. I haven't tried mucking with the graphic settings much."

The best way to get future enhancements and fixes for Mac users is probably to get more of us playing it!

macgaming,39gbah,nhooyr,3,Fri Jun 12 14:26:40 2015 UTC,"I'll teach you how to find trustworthy ISOs and torrents.  First go here https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/downloads/hh442898.aspx  Select what you need, in this case windows 8.1 with update. It will make you log in if you're not logged in. Next select the ISO. You will select Windows 8.1 with Update (multiple editions) (x64) - DVD (English-United Kingdom). Click details. Now take that SHA-1 hash and type it into google. I clicked the first link which was http://forums.overclockers.co.uk/showthread.php?t=18646312&page=2. Download the ISO now by clicking the google drive link and selecting the x64 iso. Once downloaded, open terminal then type  openssl sha1    and then drag the file there, press enter and it will output the hash. Make sure you have the exact same hash as the one from Microsoft. Congrats, you have your hands on an official ISO! :) Hasn't ever failed for me yet. You can also search for the file name or add ""torrent"" after the file name/hash as well. Basically just use the hash/filename/(""torrent"" after one of them) to search for the file, download and verify with hash."

Concerned about whether I could use my Win8 key for a Win8.1 ISO, I went through the process you outlined and found a Win8 standard ISO, used Terminal to output the hash, and successfully matched it with what's listed on MS's site.

The main thing games on OSX lack compared to their PC counter-parts is optimization, but with games that support Metal, I bet you we will see anything between PC-Like performance to double the FPS.   If Metal allows the few of us on the new Mac Pro to open up that second GPU for gaming....LJKSDHFLKJFHSF the performance...omg.

macgaming,39d0w3,aaabballo,6,Thu Jun 11 01:32:55 2015 UTC,My real question though is why not just use Vulkan instead? Wouldn't it be better to support a cross platform API?
macgaming,39d0w3,reallynotnick,2,Thu Jun 11 03:51:17 2015 UTC,Vulkan and Metal are pretty similar but it seems like Apple thinks it has a lot more momentum and power by using its own Metal technology on OS X as well as the super duper tons of iPhones.

Ive never had a serious chance to play it until recently.  The only platform I have is a mac and I know its not a renowned games platform but nonetheless, games have been emulated or transferred to the mac platform.  I checked out GOG.com and I typed ""fallout"" on their search engine and there was no result.  I do have a virtual machine (Parallels) with windows  8 installed.  Should I install fallout for PC and have it running on Windows 8 installed on my virtual machine, running on my mac?"

Works best for DirectX 9.0c or earlier games, though they have been working on DX10 & 11. [HTTP://WWW.portingteam.com](portingteam) may have Cider or Wineskin wrapper(s) for Fallout. Cider is also Wine-based and much like Wineskin is easier to use than straight Wine. Cider is from ""transgaming, Inc"", who use it to lazily port games to Mac that are sold under the guise of being true native apps. It's usually worth it to try Wineskin + Cider both, as they have their own issues running things; Cider tends to work better when it bothers to work, Wineskin tends to work easier/more often, but has more random issues that break games."

Under CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\Direct3D make two keys (DWORD)  VideoPciDeviceID = 0x00000402 VideoPciVendorID = 0x000010de  This makes any games think you have a GeForce 8800 GTS and makes them use their nVidia rendering path. This works well with the Intel HD's rendering system.  Be sure to hack the registry BEFORE you run the first time, or if you've already built a bottle (like I did), just go to your Crossover Steam application and uninstall and reinstall Fallout 3 GOTY.

Added: I forgot to mention that 13"" MBPs only have an integrated GPU. A lot of games are either unsupported, or flat-out won't run on integrated GPUs.

macgaming,38kkwp,aaabballo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:08:45 2015 UTC,"Haven't tried V, but because of a lack of DirectX support - if I knew I could use the DX needed, I'd try it. GTA IV runs though (in a Cider wrapper, running on a stock MBP 8.2 with OSX 10.9.5), with minimal issues I addressed in a post a few hours ago here on reddit. Also runs in Crossover. Basically limited to DX 9.0c or lower games, 10+ support is bad in Wine, so it also sucks in Crossover, Cider, and PlayOnMac; my VMWare Fusion trial expired, but GTA IV ran on there, too. VirtualBox using Win 7 couldn't handle it, dont have Parallels to try but guessing it'd work great, and don't have a Windows install so haven't tried Bootcamp.  Even if you somehow use Windows on a Mac laptop & your CPU + RAM meet or surpass requirements for a game you can still be limited by the integrated or discrete Graphics Card. Integrated is the weak one built into motherboard for basic graphics - most anything not video or game, it seems like on mine. Discrete one is a more powerful gfx card used when stuff gets computationally intense, and often causes a hotspot on keyboard + fan to run on high. Noticed a few games that won't use discrete graphics cards of Mac PC's (through reading forum ""Help!"" posts/system requirements pages), some games require a certain amount of RAM with a given integrated/discrete gfx card, many claim to not support specific gfx cards, some can have glitches with certain cards..etc, etc.  Basically: Study. Know your Mac & it's hardware; find some games you really want; find ""No-CD fix""-es if they'll be necessary (it is if it would be needed with your install on Windows); get some of Wine/Wineskin/PlayOnMac/Crossover/VMWare Fusion/Parallels & a copy of Windows (may need multiple - some games need XP, others Vista/7) for testing games on; optionally some Cider wrappers + knowledge on usage (portingteam.com) - these are special Wine wrappers that sometimes run Windows games very well. Within all that is the ability to try to run any Windows game you want, but it will take a bit of work (mostly downloading all the stuff...LoL), and not be very successful unless you only want DX 9.0c or older games or can multi-boot Windows/OSX AND your laptop has a set of graphics cards most Windows games like + good CPU + nice RAM (4GB doing okay..would recommend 8+)."

Almost like a vibration, only not, you'll know when your on the scroll bar. Battery life seems good so far. I've had it for a bit now.

macgaming,38etp4,Linked-NZ,2,Thu Jun 4 10:01:27 2015 UTC,"Logitech just announced the MX Anywhere 2.  It may be worth waiting to see when those become available, as they're not only Bluetooth, but multiple device ready; you can have it set up for 3 different devices and a switch/button on the bottom toggles which device you're controlling.  I have used the MX Anywhere since I bought my MacBook, and it just recently started having the dreaded double-click problem.  Rumor is that Logitech has fixed this in the MX Master and MX Anywhere 2.  I play WoW, HotS, Starcraft 2, it works well for everything but serious PvP where I prefer more buttons (and I have a Naga for that).  The side scroll buttons on the MX Anywhere are VERY well made, and very viable as buttons for mapping in games, unlike the MX Performance, which has a tolerable left side scroll and unusable right side scroll button.  Until the double-click problem, the MX Anywhere was absolutely my favorite mouse I've ever owned.  I was not far from ordering a replacement this morning when I noticed that Verge had an article about the new one.  Edit:  added verge link and a bit about the side-scroll buttons"

This is why iOS gets apps before Android before Windows Phone, why Linux gets developer tools before Mac before Windows, and why Windows gets games before Mac and Linux. Sometimes, Linux gets a game before Mac, no doubt the cost of purchasing a Mac vs. the zero price of Linux plays a part in that."

macgaming,389csf,Lateraleye,2,Tue Jun 2 21:11:52 2015 UTC,"For those games you listed, you shouldn't have much of an issue.  In CS:GO and LOL's cases, they were designed to be playable on lots of machines of varying specs... part of the reason they are so popular.  Just remember to always play in Bootcamp for best performance.  Here's a thread I found on MacRumors where a guy was playing Tera smoothly on a 11"" Air from 3 years ago.  Your 2015 machine should be able to handle it just fine, especially on medium.  http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tera-online.1361464/"

macgaming,38665o,jakej118,2,Tue Jun 2 03:16:36 2015 UTC,"Here's what I do to get a bit better gaming performance.   Keep it plugged into the wall.  Download smc fan control and set the fans to high, this helps keep your cpu/gpu cooler and therefore run a bit better. try to keep it cool from the outside as well with external fans and keeping the back end elevated for better air flow.    IF you're interested in using windows on bootcamp that will definitely boost performance. then you can download razer cortex to try and optimize performance. windows 8.1(64bit) version works well. plus if you bought it recently you'll be able to get windows 10 for free at the end of july which will come with directx 12 so games will be better optimized.   when in doubt turn down graphics in the game itself.  hope that helped!"

macgaming,38665o,RTGoldfish,2,Tue Jun 2 05:03:59 2015 UTC,Are you trying to run at retina resolution?  If so that'll be your issue.   For the record I run the game on high settings and 1600x900 with zero issues on a late 2011.   Also you might want to limit your frames per second if you're getting throttling (usually manifests as an obnoxious stutter). Type:  fps_max 64 into console (the valve servers are only 64 tic so doesn't really make sense to run a framerate over that).

It's not like it's canon...  TSL Loot & Immersion Adds a lot of new armors & items, all of which are beautifully skinned, it also makes some other small changes, like giving mandalore his canonical helmet and changing the shaders the droids use.  Player & Party Underwear has new unique underwear for your party members, yourself and it fixes the standard male underwear skin wrap if you don't want to use the new ones.  Hi Poly Tin Cans replaces the low quality saber models with high quality ones, while still using the original design. (don't use the Nihilus/Tobin ones as they cause a crash in TSL RCM  If you want higher quality weapons you could install the beta of Weapon Model Overhaul for TSL first and then install (and overwrite some of it with) Blaster Pistol Enhancement This will change some (not all) of the weapons to higher quality ones which are much prettier to look at. I don't know if the first project will ever be finished, I hope so.  That's all I can think of for now."

macgaming,385kad,Ethrealin,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:52:14 2015 UTC,"if that's the ""unofficial patch"": It's not compatible with TSLRCM it doesn't nearly restore as much content as TSLRCM (all of the content that's restored is allready in TSLRCM anyways) and, more importantly, it mostly consists of content taken from other mods and authors, patched together and released without their permission.   It doesn't do anything to better the graphics as far as I know, apart from some added shaders."
macgaming,385kad,1Leonard,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:16:46 2015 UTC,"Actually improving the graphics alongside with fixing ll the bugs was the main idea behind this patch. Keep in mind that it was released ages ago, and at that time TSLRCM wasn't as stable as it is now. Xenon's patch, while clearly stealing other's content, was providing better game experience. On this day, however, I guess it's only the graphics that make Xenon's patch worthy.  EDIT: I am wrong. Just checked the original thread on bioware.ru, and it turned out that the priority list is bugfixes>content>graphics. It is quite ironic that five years later the least prioritised feature became the only feature."
macgaming,385kad,Ethrealin,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:25:14 2015 UTC,"Still, it is not compatible with TSLRCM and installing it will make your game unstable.  Now I'm curious about the specific changes in graphics. Could you post a link with screenshots comparing the changes?"
macgaming,385kad,1Leonard,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:51:20 2015 UTC,"Actually installing Xenon's patch makes your game stable, because she fixed all bugs that cause crushes, freezes etc.  As for screenshots, there used to be some, but I guess these imageshack images are outdated, and there is no way to restore them.

macgaming,385kad,Ethrealin,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:09:55 2015 UTC,you're not understanding the point I'm making: It's not compatible with TSLRCM and installing them together will make your game unstable. All the bugs that are fixed by that patch are also fixed in TSLRCM which makes installing that patch pretty much unneeded.
macgaming,385kad,1Leonard,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:13:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, now I see what you meant, and I mentioned as well: now that TSLRCM fixes bugs as well graphics are the only reason why you might consider installing Xenon's patch over TSLRCM."
macgaming,385kad,Ethrealin,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:17:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the thing is: there are way too many conflicts in the files between ""Xenon's"" patch and TSLRCM so installing them both is a recipe for disaster."

Running on a lower resolution with lower texture settings will use far less VRAM than what the game was ""intended"" for.

After that use a custom fan management program like this one and set it to a custom setting in which you monitor the cpu core temp, make the fan turn on at 50 degrees Celsius with a max around 70 degrees Celsius.

For the keyboard I just wipe it down if it gets dirty/sweaty with a microfibre cloth when I need to.

""Besiege"" - A goofy physics-based medieval siege engine creator. This is a little tough to play with the trackpad, but doable and definitely worth the money.  ""FEZ"" - A very addictive puzzle-platformer with a unique 2D/3D combination.

I travel a lot and I always try to have a few games on my MBPr (late 2013 8 GB) to kill time that aren't graphically demanding, aren't affected by MBP/OS X's shortcomings and can be played without a mouse.  Here are some suggestions, I can specify more if you say what kind of games you like:  Roguelikes   The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth Crypt of the Necromancer Darkest Dungeon Dungeons of Dredmor FTL Neo Scavenger Risk of Rain Tales of Maj'Eyal: one of the best traditional roguelikes imho, I have it on Steam, but it's free on its website. Really tough.   RPG   LISA: it's like a darker, crazier, side scrolling Earthbound. The Banner Saga: SRPG, it runs very hot so I wouldn't play it on battery Shadowrun Returns/Dragonfall: more like a cRPG, I've been playing these (and Chronicles) lately, but they also run very hot. I bought Divinity OS and Pillars of Eternity too and their performance seems atrocious on my MBP, so I'll play them on a PC.   Platformers (best played on a gamepad for the most part)   Braid Cave Story+: the first indie hit and still one of the best metroidvanias ever. Escape Goat 1 & 2: great puzzle platformers to play in short bursts. FEZ: another charming puzzle platformer. I'm think it's a bit overrated, but it's still worth playing. Offspring Fling: more puzzle. Stealth Bastard Deluxe: good and simple stealth platformer. SteamWorld Dig: Short but fun, sort of a mixture between a metroidvania and Spelunker with all the digging. Thomas Was Alone: super short, super simple, super fun puzzle platformer. Toki Tori 1 & 2+: even more puzzles.   There's an incredible amount of amazing platformers for OS X on Steam, but I wouldn't recommend playing them without gamepad on a laggy OS and a laggy screen: Broforce, Dust: An Elysian Tail, Dustforce, Electronic Super Joy, Guacamelee, Mark of the Ninja, Savant: Ascent, Shovel Knight, Super Meat Boy, Unepic, Valdis Story...  Others   Prison Architect: I'm not a big fan of city building games, but I enjoy building and managing a prison from time to time. Don't Starve: also not a big fan of survival games, but I've sunk quite a few hours on this one. Kingdom Rush. the third and last genre I don't enjoy much: tower defence games. This one is casual and great. Dungeon of the Endless: same as above, but this one is more roguelikey. HuniePop: there, I said it. I would never play it in public though. Race the Sun: it's about flying fast while avoiding obstacles."

If you just bought an older Mac, setting up Bootcamp is pretty striaghtforward... as long as you have a Windows disc/disk and license.  Having both OS X and Windows is really great.

As for Bootcamp is a tad more complicated, as some games (even newer ones) are playable with current Iris graphics.  In both cases you may have to tweak a lot. It really depends of the game you want to play. From the top of my head, Blizzard and Valve games are good to go. Maybe (and it's a BIG maybe) GTA V on the lowest at 30 FPS and 900p.

macgaming,36rti7,araquen,-2,Mon Jun 1 22:11:48 2015 UTC,"My suggestion?    Bootcamp. I run a ""PC Gaming"" box via Bootcamp. I don't suggest Windows 8.1, but I'm running 8.1 through Bootcamp on a Mc Pro 2009 with an ATI Raedon 4870, so I might be taxing my system.    Bootcamp is free, and if you had a PC, then you should have all the necessary installs. Bootcamp is also not emulation. This would let you run your PC games on your Mac almost as well as you did on the PC.  For Mac-specific, frankly I have found that Blizzard is the best in supporting Macs.  Most other developers port to Mac. Blizzard develops natively. I know WoW is subscription, but I think it's money well spent (plus, you can play the first 20 levels for free, and you can use wow tokens to pay your sub using gold).  I avoid DDO and LotRO only because the graphics quality is completely unpalatable."

Having to buy a new copy does put a crimp in things.  So let's discount Bootcamp for now.  I'm really not impressed with the Mac-only offerings, except WoW. Guild Wars 2 wasn't bad. You might want to check out Steam. Also, FFXIV is rumored to have a Mac port soon™ though they are also subscription. I am not a fan of Turbine's offerings but it can't hurt to dabble.

macgaming,36nudz,TediBare123,2,Wed May 20 19:46:00 2015 UTC,"It might be that your MacBook is running at 60fps but the iPhone at 30fps, significantly reducing the processing power required. The iPhone 6's native resolution is 1280x720 but it might be running at a slightly lower resolution to allow the game to run smoothly since this is usually much less noticeable on the smaller screen. It may also be an optimisation problem with Hearthstone: since more users probably play on PC or iOS.  If there is an option in-game you could try capping the framerate at 30fps to limit the gpu usage. If not I wouldn't worry too much: the MacBook ends up getting quite hot playing most games but this shouldn't affect performance too much. If the fan is irritating you I would recommend using headphones since you get better sound quality and can barely hear the fan (especially with a bit of noise cancellation)."

Large-scale empire building style games. Might not be exactly what you're looking for (what you're describing sounds more like RTS). The Total War series might be closer, with more direct battlefield control. There are probably other games out there that also fit your requirements (I've heard good things about Age of Wonders III, but haven't had a chance to try it yet). Just a few suggestions from across the Strategy genre. Might be easier if you could narrow the focus down a bit (RTS vs 4X vs Grand Strategy vs MOBA vs Turn-Based Strategy, etc)."

macgaming,36dab8,Eurasian-HK,1 point,Mon May 18 15:32:12 2015 UTC,"Personally, I've been playing a lot of EU4, but the learning curve there is rather steep and games can drag on quite a while. As I think about it, this probably wouldn't fit what OP is looking for as it doesn't have a lot of direct control in battles, just macro control over the entire war, but it definitely has nation building, controlling the government, diplomacy, etc.  Honestly, of my suggestions, I think Total War fits best. Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of experience with those yet (just picked up TW: Rome and Napoleon during a sale and played through the tutorial), but it seems to meet a number of his requirements. That said, it doesn't have control over individual units, but rather platoons.  Another suggestion in the RTS field might be Planetary Annihilation. Again, I haven't had much chance to play it, but I hear it's rather good, especially after some of their latest patches."

macgaming,36dab8,MinisterforFun,1 point,Tue May 19 17:43:20 2015 UTC,"I would echo the suggestion of anything made by Paradox, particularly for nation building and depth. TheEuropa Universalis series is probably the deepest and grandest series in regards to historical and political intricacies.  I really can't recommend them enough, but gamers expecting action will be disappointed.  The Total War series offers excellent strategic battlefield control, along with some pretty solid Nationbuilding. I've been a fan of the series since the original Shogun, back in the late 90s.  If OP wants battle control, this is where it's at.  I've recently started playing an older game which strikes a balance between the two: Mount and Blade Warband. It's more involved as far as combat is concerned, and the RPG aspects of it, as well as the sandbox style of play makes it feel so open and limitless. It takes quite a while to get into it though."

Unfortunately, there aren't any official Mac drivers for it, and while some games have a controller driver built in, not all of them do (not sure if the Arkham games have them or not). That said, there are a couple fan-made drivers that work well and are recognizable by most games, although I've run into a couple games where the fan-made driver clashed with the game's driver. Still, a solid choice and not too expensive, around $30 on Amazon, and they're occasionally on sale for cheaper."

macgaming,368k4m,plastic9mm,1 point,Sun May 17 17:28:41 2015 UTC,"You will most likely need a USB adapter. The reason why is due to the 3.5mm jack you are using. Odds are it's a headphone jack and not a multi-purpose 3.5mm like what's on your phone of on the Xbox One controller adapter. Te headphone jack will only pump audio out, it has no connection for the third section on your 3.5mm input, it goes unused and the headset only functions as headphones with no mic input. If you have a mic jack, you can plug in there and see that the mic is now picked up, however the headphones function won't work. A USB audio adapter with a 3.5mm port should allow you to use both features of your headset.  Something like this should do what you need.

Civilization V is another choice if you want something similar but with an easier learning curve. Also been playing my way through Batman: Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. Borderlands 2 is fairly good, or you can pick up Counter Strike: Global Offensive if you like that. Team Fortress 2 is also good for a quick, cartoony, free-to-play FPS. I've also been playing a bit of War Thunder, a FTP WWII plane and tank battle game. Oh, also Cities: Skylines is a great city builder, similar to the older Sim City games (and vastly superior to the latest Sim City). Kerbal Space Program is also something worth looking at, it's great fun.  There's plenty of other games that are worth looking at. Those are just some of the ones that come to mind right away. I'd suggest browsing through Steam, sorting by user reviews, and check ""Narrow by OS"" and whichever genres you want to look for.

A lot of players have commented that it's considerably more polished and complete than is the norm for Early Access titles.  One major difference with the Tropico games was that they were funded in advance by an external publishing company, Kalypso. Victor Vran is our own independent project (I'm a bit wary of the term ""indie"", as it has been stretched thin to mean almost nothing.)  We gathered a lot of useful feedback and made major changes due to the early access phase - Diablo-style mouse control, late game content, and another major feature which is yet unannounced. Could we have done this in a traditional free beta? Sure, but the extra income helps, and the signal/noise ratio of free betas is much worse.  In any case, I understand your concerns, and the aversion to ""paying to test the game for us"". I hope you like the game when it ships in its complete form this summer!"

If you want good performance with a high end game like GTA V then your best solution is Bootcamp. Obviously buying a game developed for the Mac is the best option if a Mac version exists ;)  USB3 has nothing to do with being able to play games on a Mac, it's more likely someone installed bootcamp on an external USB3 HDD and that is what you read about.  Your rMBP 13"" uses an Intel integrated graphics solution which is not designed for gaming however you should be able to play many modern games however you might not be able to use retina resolutions."

macgaming,35yk0z,NeedAChainsaw,2,Thu May 14 20:05:01 2015 UTC,its pretty easy to get games on your external hard drive. during the setup just change to where the files save from Program Files to somewhere on your external drive. But you will have to be on Windows to run them.

macgaming,35yk0z,vidyagameking,1 point,Fri May 15 02:59:55 2015 UTC,okay I was having trouble installing steam and shit through wine so I decided to use a program called playonmac...I played games on there for a little bit but I decided to switch over to bootcamp. It makes the games run so well and smooth. I can run games like GTA V on a fairly high setting. If you are part of a university try to see if they have free copies of windows.

macgaming,35twdf,exclamationmarek,2,Wed May 13 16:01:50 2015 UTC,"Windows 8.1 takes about 25GB of space + makes a hibernation file that is equal in size to your RAM (so 8GB) so a total of ~33GB. You can switch off hibernation to get that extra space, at the cost of not being able to hibernate and using a powered sleep instead. In any case, add 1 or 2GB for drivers and some basic utilities.  BUT, most games can run from external drives. You can get a fairly cheap USB 3.0 portable hard drive and keep all your games there. The loading times won't be very fast, but it will work just fine, I play GTA V this way. Just don't use a USB 2.0 drive, since they are slow!"
macgaming,35twdf,exclamationmarek,2,Wed May 13 19:52:50 2015 UTC,Didn't know that. How does hibernation work and can I just delete the files since I don't need it because I'm only using Windows to play games? Is it safe?
macgaming,35twdf,TediBare123,2,Wed May 13 21:26:08 2015 UTC,"A computer can either:   Power down - this closes all applications and switches off all components of the computer Hibernate - this saves the state of the computer - all opened applications, windows and files - to that hibernate file and then shuts down all components of the computer. When you power it back up, everything was just as you left it. This is the default behaviour on both OS X and Windows when you close the lid of a laptop Sleep - this shuts down SOME components of the computer, while still supplying power to a couple (the RAM is still powered, and the CPU is in a very low power state). This way, when you return everything was as you left it, but without having to write to that hibernate file. The downside is a little bit of power consumption (very little, but if you leave it sleeping while not connected to a wall power supply, it will drain the battery empty within a day or two).   You CAN NOT SIMPLY DELETE that file. Things will go wrong if you do that. If you want to regain that hard drive space, follow the instructions on how to disable hibernation that are in this link: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/920730 It's easy peasy and worth it ;)  *edit: Oh and it is completely safe! If you disable hibernation, your computer will ""sleep"" instead. Just don't leave it sleeping while only on battery power and you are good and safe."

I Have then partitioned about 200GB of an external hard drive for mass storage of larger games. Since Steam can handle multiple libraries nicely all I do is plug in the HDD and I can play any games from both libraries (SSD and HDD). I'm not sure if this would work for you but it is certainly an option to consider (especially as it limits the precious SSD space you sacrifice for Boot Camp since high capacity hard drives are really cheap now)"
macgaming,35twdf,ericelawrence,1 point,Wed May 13 22:32:26 2015 UTC,"I have a 3.0 USB HDD drive, I use it to store large files and for time machine too... can I use it to store games directly from steam? Does it work well?"
macgaming,35twdf,crablin,1 point,Thu May 14 02:19:56 2015 UTC,"It works as well as a hard drive will. Obviously loading times will be slower than the SSD but it is very easy to use Disk Utility to partition the hard drive. I would suggest formatting the Windows partition to ExFAT (this can be done in Disk Utility).  To store Steam games on it just click install on the game in your library then, under the 'choose location for install' dropdown menu, select 'create new library on drive [hard drive partition name]. You can then name a folder on the hard drive that Steam will use as your second library and just have to select it under the dropdown menu when installing a game. Note that if you unplug your hard drive while a game is open (or if Steam isn't recognising the library for whatever reason) just go to Preferences, Downloads, Steam Library Folders, click Add New Library and select the folder on the hard drive. This can also be done if you plug the drive in after opening Steam.   One other thing to be aware of is that, unlike Mac OS formatted partitions, resizing Windows partitions will clear all data on the Windows partition being resized (not the Mac OS partitions though) Just bear this in mind when deciding what size to make the partition and remember to back it up in some way if you plan on resizing the partition."

macgaming,35twdf,SoCalWingFan,1 point,Thu May 14 13:16:13 2015 UTC,You can use the existing exfat partition for games. Just make sure you have enough space so they can all be stored in that partition and create the library folder through Steam.

macgaming,35loon,John_Candy_,7,Mon May 11 15:04:22 2015 UTC,"DirectX is windows only; it's made by Microsoft, it's part of the windows system core.  Mac OS X has OpenGL.  Most games use both; if a game is out for Mac, it will support OpenGL. If it's not out for Mac, using a Wine wrapper will give you DirectX (well, it has DX runtime equivalent..) Or you can boot into a bootcamp windows install.."
macgaming,35loon,mathcampbell,1 point,Mon May 11 15:14:25 2015 UTC,"aha! I understand Open GL somewhat, so this definitely helps me contextualize it.   so I guess there aren't any ways to optimize a GPU in the way DX does for Windows?"
macgaming,35loon,mathcampbell,5,Mon May 11 15:18:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure what you're talking about regarding optimization - this sounds rather like marketing blurb. DX (and OpenGL) are graphics libraries that applications (usually games) use to send instructions to the GPU (and CPU).  They are ""optimised"" to deliver the best results... Mac uses OpenGL.  Historically, DX has been seen as a better performer because all the games run on it etc. on windows, so MS put a lot more time into it, whereas OpenGL lagged behind.  Gap is closing now.  Either which way, don't worry about it."

macgaming,35k1x9,iguessdragonsarecool,1 point,Mon May 11 02:59:24 2015 UTC,"Well for a mouse I think someone should use whatever they are comfortable with. The basic logitech mouse that you are using is what your hand is used to, and using a different mouse will take days/weeks of adjustment time to get used to for high competitive MOBA's. Personally I use a Razer Deathadder and love it, but it is by no means necessary to game at a high level. There are Korean starcraft pros who compete at the highest level (RTS's are insane for mouse movement) and use a shitty $5 mouse, since that is what they are used to.  I really like using an external keyboard for gaming on my laptop, since the laptop gets quite warm and makes my keyboard wrist/hand quite sweaty. I this small mechanical keyboard, but really just buy whatever you feel best to type on."
macgaming,35k1x9,joebloomy,1 point,Mon May 11 03:08:23 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with this generally, the most expensive mouse or keyboard doesn't mean the best experience for you individually. A lot of it is about the feel of them both that you are comfortable with for max use.  I personally am still using a Razer Diamondback gaming mouse from 5+ years ago, with a razer mouse mat.  I bought an Apple magic mouse recently and whilst it looks nice and everything I don't find it all that comfortable in my hand and I'm just too used to the pinpoint accuracy of the razer mouse.  For keyboard I have the standard bluetooth mac one, that does me fine, but I might fancy a nice mech one soon."
macgaming,35k1x9,srstatz,1 point,Mon May 11 13:40:54 2015 UTC,"I play both Civ and XCOM as well as some rpg games on my rMBP, but HAD to get a mouse because the trackpad and CAD just wasn't working out. I caught a sale around Black Friday for the Logitech G502 Proteus Core mouse, and have really come to love it. It has 3 programable profiles stored in the mouse, one for my laptop, one for my work PC, and one I customize to whatever game I'm obsessed with currently. Also DPI change on the fly is nice and I love the free spinning scroll wheel.   But how a device fits in the hand is probably the most important for me. I'm a light claw grip and a mouse that's too short kills it for me. Keeping my thumb off the pad is a plus."
macgaming,35k1x9,Deltec,1 point,Mon May 11 04:27:26 2015 UTC,"I'm boring and just use an Apple Magic Mouse for my causal gaming, but that's only because I like having everything on my desk Apple themed. I also use a PS3 controller for games like GTA and such, which I definitely recommend simply because the Mac has native bluetooth support for it, and a lot of games work well with it. Plus a used sixaxis is only like $20."
macgaming,35k1x9,bit_flipr,1 point,Mon May 11 04:50:49 2015 UTC,The Xbox 360 wireless controller for PC works really well compatibility-wise. Using the Tattiebogle OS X driver helps this function. Make sure to grab the Yosemite compatible driver here: https://github.com/d235j/360Controller/releases

macgaming,35i0vi,ipickert55,2,Mon May 11 00:15:59 2015 UTC,"I agree.    I was super excited for Evolve when it was initially announced.  When I saw it wasn't going to be on Mac, I thought hey maybe I will finally have a reason for a PS4.    Then when I found it it was basically a DLC catalog, I was all meh/nope."

macgaming,35i0vi,ciawal,1 point,Mon May 11 09:29:19 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of DLC for the game to be sure, but you can play with/against players who have the DLC and you don't, so that's something. Unlike say, any Modern Warfare game or things with map packs that segregate the community, here everyone is in the same pool."
