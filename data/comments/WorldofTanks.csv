WorldofTanks,3e35pc,Zwersch,16,Tue Jul 21 16:33:33 2015 UTC,I think bounces can't kill but ricochet can hit another target.
WorldofTanks,3e35pc,hellhelium,10,Tue Jul 21 16:41:31 2015 UTC,Correct.  Bounces are dead rounds.  Ricochets are still live rounds and can penetrate

WorldofTanks,3e24vp,podian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:00 2015 UTC,"You must have IGP, notebook or something?

WorldofTanks,3e24vp,Iohet,2,Tue Jul 21 12:25:40 2015 UTC,Reducing the texture quality would improve performance regardless – it's certainly worth trying. Do you not find that to be the case?

WorldofTanks,3e24vp,podian,2,Tue Jul 21 13:05:27 2015 UTC,Quite a few of them you could put up without too much difference I bet (as mentioned in the vid). Textures are one of the ones that would have an FPS drop (they do for me) but it's worth trying in a replay to see.
WorldofTanks,3e24vp,Finear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:51 2015 UTC,"If you have unused video memory, then textures probably won't drop your FPS."
WorldofTanks,3e24vp,Cyral,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:48 2015 UTC,Depends on your system configuration. It takes more power to render higher quality textures than lower quality ones.

WorldofTanks,3e3xzo,SFXBTPD,5,Tue Jul 21 19:42:04 2015 UTC,"Do not go 2 line on the beach. You have a limited corridor, zero flank chances, and you will have to fight uphill.   9/0 is generally medium territory. Be careful exposing to base snipers. If you can win the e/f line then you can snipe into the mid to clean that up. South has a much easier time sniping in but is more exposed to the enemy base ridge. 9/0 is generally easier to flex from than any other portion of the map as you are not down in a valley.  Likewise, if mid is taken, you can snipe up into the 9/0. Synergy between those two lines tends to win the game. Mid is definitely a brawl, though. Be cautious going in there blind at the start of the game. Assess tank lineups and how many allies are coming with you before you fully commit. If you do commit, push to their side to cut the angle that their snipers have.  Be careful assaulting base. It is always uphill, and while a clever flank attempt can get in behind defenders, you may very quickly isolate yourself. Switching between approaches takes quite a while. It is generally best to contain them in base then mop up anything outside of it before attempting to assault. North base is significantly harder to crack. If you have arty, try to poke the approaches to find their arty, eliminate it, then back off and let arty work over the defenders. In general, the east approaches to the bases are easier."

Has awful mobility, virtually no gun depression and can be penned with a soggy croissant.  Then I realised I was playing it wrong.  Like most light tanks you really need to avoid getting shot at. At the beginning of the game either look for a passive scouting spot or pick early spotting routes that lets you get some idea how the enemy is deploying without exposing yourself unnecessarily. Example, surfing the middle ridge on Prokhorovka. You want to be just far enough up to spot but not high enough to give the enemy an easy shot at you (it's something you learn through practice).  Whichever method you use just make sure you don't get shot. If you don't have sixth sense yet then err on the side of caution, if you spot an enemy tank while you're still moving and in the open then assume you've been spotted, if there are enemy tanks coming towards you then bug out, do whatever it takes to not get shot.  The longer the battle goes on the more powerful the AMX 12t becomes, thanks mostly to its secret weapon, the clip in the gun. That clip gives you a potential 835hp of burst damage, all you need is the opportunity to use it.  Look for lone enemy tanks, tanks that are busy with your teammates or just tanks that have very little health. Look for the opportunity to get to their sides or rear without stupidly exposing yourself to other enemy tanks, then simply drive up and assassinate them. That clip and your conserved health pool are what makes the AMX 12t a great little tank.  It's not much of a snipers gun and on the move it's accuracy is somewhat non existent so you will have to get reasonably close but if you are within range and the target has less than 800hp they are going to die. If they have more than 800 health and you're feeling brave then do a drive by, empty your clip into them and keep going.  Oh, one last thing. Even if you have enough shells to kill your target assume that something will go wrong, a bounced shot or missing completely. Have a route planned out before you commit, have an escape route to head for before you even leave cover. Even if you kill your target there may be others paying attention so make sure you can get into cover as soon as you've emptied your clip."

WorldofTanks,3e3t2n,CPTObvious08,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:45 2015 UTC,"Learn to be precise with your shots in the 12t. The 13 75 uses the same gun, so knowing weakspots and when to hold your shot or let loose is crucial. Setup your crew skills to be the ultimate passive scout, 6th and camo are your friends. Firing on the move isnt something you should do unless you are fairly close, even with appropriate skills. If you take the time and learn to love the 12t, the rest of the lights will treat you kindly"

WorldofTanks,3e3t2n,Azaz129,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:52:23 2015 UTC,"well, 13 75 uses same gun, simply has more hp. A lot of ppl dont like it, for me, it was kinda ok. The 13 90 is the one you are looking for, has amazing gun that can deal a lot of dmg in one clip and cripple, even kill enemy tanks, the pen is not that much though, for the enemies u will see, u wont be able to pen frontally a lot of the tanks in t9 and t10, gold rounds makes it a bit better, but when u get behind them, it shows the true power of the gun"
WorldofTanks,3e3t2n,omghloy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:05:20 2015 UTC,"I honestly found the most success with it by being a support tank rather than a scout. Trying to scout with the thing like other lights just results in tears (full disclosure: had no 6th sense for all 230 games in it). The gun is rather capable in pen and accuracy. Let other tanks distract while you pump 810 dmg/clip into the enemy. By being alive at the end of the game, your autoloader is extremely dangerous"
WorldofTanks,3e3t2n,petewilko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:00:41 2015 UTC,"the transition between elc and 12t is really hard. You need start thinking more like a assassin and less like a hit and run like elc. You have much less mobility but much more burst damage and decent camo. use this.  After getting the style, you go love 75/90, and take another punch when get the lorraine."

WorldofTanks,3e2878,PlanetaryGenocide,5,Tue Jul 21 13:45:51 2015 UTC,"""As long as you don't use actual model files""  Exactly this part. Without using the pre-existing models in WoT, that means not just printing, but creating the models from scratch. Would there be enough of a market to make the cost of 3d scanning/modelling a whole  tank (and all the logistics around it) a financially viable  option?  The napkin tanks would be easier, but then you possibly have less of a market for them from non-WoT modellers as they never existed. Historical accuracy being important to a lot of them.  May be easier to just get copyright permission from WG to use theirs.  Remember WG already has licensed models."

It takes time and patience but the final outcome is worth it. r/modelmakers if you guys want to learn how to start modeling. It can be super easy depending on the kit. I feel like 3d printing would work better for games that have unique models such as ksp, borderlands, dark souls, bioshock etc. 3d printing tanks could be viable for the lazy or people that are very busy. But there are prebuilt models pretty cheap on ebay so I don't feel like the 3d printed tanks would do very well unless they were advertised by wg."

WorldofTanks,3e1nib,backjacker,10,Tue Jul 21 07:09:22 2015 UTC,"I will always use optics over vents unless I am going for a DPM god setup.  The small boost to DPM and handling is negligible when compared to the potential benefits optics can give you.  Imagine you are on the prokhorovka hill, you can shoot without being spotted, because your enemy has installed vents instead of optics. If you too have vents in this scenario, you can't do shit. If you have optics though, they give you an opportunity at ~1900 damage which you couldn't otherwise get.  Unless you are on province, I can't see myself taking vents on an E50M. Over 500 view range is just so overpowered when you can move and have it."
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,thespichopat,3,Tue Jul 21 08:38:57 2015 UTC,"But in the current state of the game, with the state of the maps, would you say that there are enough situations where having that view range made the difference, to make optics worth it?  Because that's pretty much the main argument against optics in the current meta. ""Everything is brawl oriented, so vents all the way"""
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,newarchivist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:33 2015 UTC,"Even on a map like Himmelsdorf, if you are going up a straight-away, you can still potentially out-spot the enemy. In this case, I think it's more about early and late game vision control.  On some tanks (autoloaders, for example), one could make a case for optics and vents since they can't mount rammers."
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,Lmui,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:48 2015 UTC,"Even on city maps like himmels and Stalingrad or tiny maps like mines having high vision range is still useful. Himmels hill to 3/d/g line shooting and shooting along the 123 lanes strongly favours high view range and Camo. The same applies to Stalingrad beachside and center. Even on a small map like mines, the lighthouse/lower left corner rely on vision to control large swathes of the map.  I agree that vents can be good, but only when supplemented with a 3.5+ skill crew that can make up for the loss of vision range with crew skills."
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,Lmui,10,Tue Jul 21 19:37:25 2015 UTC,"Another argument is that IF you have vision skills and vents AND food, you'll generally surpass the 445 cap by a good margin (With 100% sit aware, vents, BIA, food on an obj. 140, you have 451.5 view range, a leo 1 has 462.8)  With recon at 50% as well, you have 457 and with 100% on both, you have 462.3, 473.9 on 410 base VR tanks.  Having sub-capped view range feels pretty crappy in all honesty on most vision controlling tanks so I don't think it's ever worth it to be sub ~450 view range on tanks like the leo, 30b, 140 etc.  Without running food though, I don't think it's worth it to run vents on a medium, the max VR you can get with 410 base vision range is 452.8 without food which is solid but doesn't really cut through camo compared to 460-470.  Edit: I personally only run optics, more vr never hurts and the benefit from vents is rarely useful since I don't run food in pubs. ~465vr is enough to spot a moving is-7 with Camo paint in the open which is where I assume most people considering vents draw the line on necessary vision"
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,MoarVespenegas,5,Tue Jul 21 07:26:51 2015 UTC,Considering the base camo of other tanks is around 6-8% you need that extra vision to burn through it.
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,Lmui,2,Tue Jul 21 12:46:33 2015 UTC,"~465 is enough to spot a moving is-7 with Camo paint in the open from max distance which is why I draw the line of usefulness at 460-470 for vents vs optics for anyone considering the use of vents. I personally am on the side of optics > vents almost unconditionally, but I can see why people choose to run with vents over optics."

WorldofTanks,3e1nib,asakyun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:18:08 2015 UTC,"For heavy tanks, camo would probably be one of the last skills to invest in, so generally people don't worry about it."
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,newarchivist,6,Tue Jul 21 19:00:31 2015 UTC,"This is why it's a good reason to play around on Tank Numbers. The Calculator Tool is so useful for seeing what the VR will be, reload, camo, aimtime. The only problem is that it doesn't allow showing if the crew is sub-optimal."
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,lzdtt,2,Tue Jul 21 12:59:37 2015 UTC,"Its plain WRONG. Your 445m view range cap doesn't work the way you think it does. If you have 445m VR, you need to go through: a) vehicle camo value and b) bushes/trees if there are any between you two.  ~Example: with 445m VR you will spot stationary full camo+vehicle camo+bia crew of obj 268 from ~370m only. Play with this tool yourself to get the idea: http://www.wotinfo.net/en/camo-calculator"
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,Lmui,2,Tue Jul 21 12:59:44 2015 UTC,"I'm fully aware of how vision mechanics work for Camo and that calculator which is how I have those numbers. In practice, you'll never spot a TD/med behind a bush before he shoots you or someone else shoots you and you'll generally always see someone shooting you if they don't back up from bush cover with 460+ vr.  The reason why 460+ is where I draw the line is that it allows you to spot Camo painted, moving heavies at max view range. There is some benefit to getting more, but that's where I personally draw the line on usefulness with diminishing returns for anyone considering vents."

WorldofTanks,3e1nib,Iohet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:55:26 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty fair way to do it for a large number of lights and mediums.  There are some ill still take optics for like the Leo because vision wins in a tank with no armor.  For heavies, it's pretty rare I don't take vents.  The 215b might be the exception given its poor armor configuration and amazing sniping ability"
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,Siriothrax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:40 2015 UTC,"Hell, the 215b I take vents to boost the already superb DPM and gun handling even further. You're so fat that you're going to be relying on friendly spots anyways."
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,exorcistfi,3,Tue Jul 21 20:55:45 2015 UTC,"If you mainly play by yourself I would always go optics over vents, unless you can reach view cap with perks/food. Vision is key. Vision wins games.   Now if you often platoon then one could argue for going vents over optics.   My setup usually starts with optics and changes to vents when crews get good."
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,batkhow,2,Tue Jul 21 09:50:56 2015 UTC,"For me it depends on the tanks. If I can brawl and whether some hits then I take vents. If I can't take many hits then I use optics, scout if I have to and survey the area before taking flanking manoeuvres."
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,Dorjan24,3,Tue Jul 21 12:33:16 2015 UTC,"Rammer, Vert stab and vents are my 3 default equipment but if vert stab isn't available I'll put on optics.  This is of course unless we're playing a setup that requires one of us to have extended view-range or something"
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,lzdtt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:18:25 2015 UTC,"On meds, I run optics on bc, t54, 62a, 140, leo1. Have vents on m46/m48/50m, whereas unsure about 50m and changed to vents on amx 30 1er recently to improve gun handling aspects.  I feel like 450-ish meters is a must. You don't benefit that much of 2.5% overall buff, but if you have bia+vents+food and VR perks and have 450m+ in it without optics, its up to you to select whatever.  But values past 480m VR never hurt as well, ability to being able to spot through that insane td/light/ru meds camo from like 400m, where the lit target often can't spot you back even if you start shooting them as opposed to spotting them at 360m is huge. You often allow yourself and your team to do first few shots, carry harder mid-late game, carry harder in more open maps.  After reaching certain values like 450m, its matter of preference and play style I guess."
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,Dukkerz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:25:37 2015 UTC,"My take on it is if you can get about 460m+ viewrange without optics, then use vents. If you can't, use optics. For example, I use vents on my E 50M, but I also have BiA, Food, Situational Awareness and Recon."
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,PlanetaryGenocide,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:26:23 2015 UTC,"(i.e. no vert stabs on russian mediums, etc.)   I doubt anyone would ever do this, vert stabs are bae  anyways, I've run optics on most of my meds ever since I got them and I probably won't stop now. I think the exception was the A-44, because the aimtime was so fucking bad that I had GLD + vents + rammer instead.  Almost all scouts I obv run optics, with the sole exception of the T49 as it's less of a scout and more of a kekmobile with the 152mm, so I run vert/GLD/vents on that to minimize bloom and aimtime and the like.  I don't play heavies and I stopped playing TD's."
WorldofTanks,3e1nib,PlanetaryGenocide,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:50:49 2015 UTC,"That's funny, if you ever watch Zeven, you'll notice that he actually doesn't run v-stabs on the majority of his tanks.

WorldofTanks,3e1nib,HiddenSwan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:46 2015 UTC,"I have watched Zeven but I didn't really pay attention to his equipment choices.  I dunno, I just find that a lot of my snapshots/on-the-move shots tend to hit where I want them to a lot more often when I have a v-stab vs when I didn't have a v-stab, even on the meds.  Besides, it's not like I have anything else to really put there since the only other choice is vents and I wouldn't replace vstab with vents regardless of the tank"

WorldofTanks,3e1nib,Rhoobarb2002,0,Tue Jul 21 15:04:19 2015 UTC,"So on light tanks.  Vents+optics.  Because vents improves maneuverability and vision and camo.  Depending on which mediums I usually do Optics>vents.  For instance russian meds are optics, vertstab, and rammer, but for the Leo1, e50m and fv4202 I use optics, vents and rammer.  Now if view range bonuses are compounded by their modules instead of total % that would be another notch in favor of both."

I found that if you're playing relatively aggressively the additional target opportunities and spotting damage you can pick up was super useful.

When presented with multiple targets, I'll look for the one that is the highest WN8 and I have best chance of penning.  If there's a unicum that is well angled, I'll fire for the tomato showing me a flat side, but if that unicum is wide open he's eating my shells.  I think this is just smart play, in the same way you want to focus fire on something that has high DPM, penetrating, whatever.   Take out the biggest threats first."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,Ohm_My_God,18,Mon Jul 20 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"If there's a unicum that is well angled, I'll fire for the tomato showing me a flat side, but if that unicum is wide open he's eating my shells.   This is a good point.  Any smart player will take the more likely shot, unless the Unicum is reasonably exposed."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,_taugrim_,11,Mon Jul 20 17:47:14 2015 UTC,"The point being that if a unicum has gotten into a good position (hulldown IS-7, sidescraping IS-4) it is foolishness to try and dig them out.  A noob might try to sidescape but you can usually pick them off.  A unicum is a unicum because they know how to do it and do it well.  So you don't play their game.  Go someplace else and kill off the tomatoes, then come back for the uni when you have the advantage of numbers."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,Gonzo262,8,Mon Jul 20 18:23:14 2015 UTC,A hull down IS7 is a hull down IS7 regardless of rating.  The point is you pick the best target that you can reliably damage(even if it means tracking them while they're sticking out for other more potent tanks to deal real damage or forcing them to burn a repair kit).  You should prioritize taking potent guns out of the game in that matrix.  A low health high threat target is more important than a high health unicum target all things being equal.
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,Iohet,4,Mon Jul 20 18:42:42 2015 UTC,A hull down IS7 is a hull down IS7 regardless of rating.   True.  But you need to remember that a 800WN8 tomato in a hulldown is7 can be far more easily coerced into doing something stupid like breaking cover than a blurple in the same situation.
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,Kirby420_,3,Mon Jul 20 21:00:07 2015 UTC,A hull down IS-7 is hull down because the player driving it put it there. A competent player is much more likely to put his tank in a position it can do well in. He's also much more likely to actually do well in it once he's there.
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,Me0fCourse,3,Mon Jul 20 20:35:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm misunderstanding this comment, but I don't see what player skill has to do with what you just described. Would you avoid a hull-down IS-7 if it was a good player, but engage if it was a bad player? Not sure if I agree with this mentality, IMO it's better to play the game and not the player."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,waterbucket999,6,Mon Jul 20 19:23:35 2015 UTC,"For example against a lower skill player I may try to get the IS7 to miss his shot then try to put a shot under his mantlet to take out the turret ring.  Thing is a unicmum is 1) not going to miss, 2) not sit still after shooting to let me place that shot.  Same with the side-scraping IS4.  If he pulls out a little to far and you can get his LFP.  But the unicum isn't going to make that mistake so why bother waiting for it.     Basically it comes down to situations where you try to bait the other guy into making a mistake.  Unicums don't make mistakes, that's why they are unicums.  Tomatoes make a lot of mistakes, that's why they are tomatoes.   It is just a matter of playing the probabilities."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,Gonzo262,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:42:08 2015 UTC,"Unicums don't make mistakes, that's why they are unicums.      Unicums often make mistakes; they make mistakes every single game. IDK where you get that idea from."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,SilasTheVirous,0,Tue Jul 21 16:33:08 2015 UTC,"Ok, fair enough. I feel like though that things like shooting accuracy isn't really what separates good and bad players. Even poor players that find themselves in a good position can do really well, they just have to point and click at all the targets. There's the chance that if you play risky just because you think the opponent is bad that you'll get owned. You might be thinking ""Hey, this guy is hull-down, but he's bad! I'll take my chances!"" while that other guy is thinking ""This idiot is charging my hull-down IS-7, guess I'll take my free damage."""

What if the guy on the other team has XVM camo? What if he's just having a good game? Good play shouldn't rely on your opponent being an idiot. A bad decision like playing pokey-pokey against a hull-down IS-7 doesn't suddenly become good just because you think the other guy is a poor player. You're basically hoping to get lucky, if your opponent does the right thing, you will 100% get destroyed. Why leave it up to chance like this?"

It depends.  If the 1-shot is 1-shot by lots of other friendlies, he's going to die most likely. So you have to decide whether it's worth your long reload to take him out, or let someone do it and instead you take out a big chunk of HP over an Unicum."

The only time I would avoid making a kill shot and hitting someone else is if a platoon mate has called the shot and is just finishing reloading.  9 times out of 10 it seems like teammates do the exact opposite of what you'd expect so I'd rather secure the kill instead of wait for an ally to do it."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,tmichael921,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:50 2015 UTC,If that 1-hit tank can't pen you or your allies or is a low caliber HE spammer then you can ignore him until the he becomes the top threat -- that's about it.

Every gun in the game is another that can do damage to your team. That person you didn't fire at may shoot your teammate one or two times before he dies, enabling the unicumd to one shot your ally, whereas had you eliminated pubby #1, the unicum would have only sent your allies tank down to 40% health"

WorldofTanks,3dynx8,boucem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:09:12 2015 UTC,Here's a question that's more to the point:  Do you go after unicum players even when you can get easier shots on other targets?  And possibly a follow up:  You do this because? a)you want to remove the biggest threat or b) fuck purples
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,lordcheeto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:43:55 2015 UTC,"Haaaaveeee you seen OneDrive? Just saying, I prefer their survey options."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,ratseal,2,Mon Jul 20 22:39:40 2015 UTC,"Same. For arty that reloads faster I will always shoot a high WN8 player first, especially if I can track him or have a clear shot at his engine deck, getting a fire or other module damage and compelling the use of a repkit. For longer reload arty I will take the shot at an easier target especially I can take an enemy gun out of the game."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,lordcheeto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you use xvm, it's always a factor in target selection. Doesn't mean it's the only factor.  Edit: Far from the only factor, I'd say."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,_taugrim_,13,Mon Jul 20 22:32:53 2015 UTC,"A conversation I had earlier about the effect of confirmation bias on the perception of XVM sniping made me wonder what a survey would show. Please try to provide useful answers, even though this is the internet.   The survey is just a few questions and should take about 5 minutes to complete. Many thanks!  Edit: I am a dummy who has never made a survey before, and should have done it on google forms instead of Survey Monkey so that I can have access to all the responses without paying. I also didn't expect hundreds of responses in a day. o.o  I will hide this post and make a better survey tomorrow. Thank you all for your answers. I will post the results of this survey along with the results of the forthcoming more thoughtful survey soon (tm). To whet your appetite, a quick glance at the results suggests that in any given battle, about 30% of the enemy team will be using xvm to help them select targets at any given time, independent of what tank they are driving. That means that if there are 3 or more arty with XVM installed in a game, it is very likely that at least one of them will be using XVM to help them select targets."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,veilwalker,7,Mon Jul 20 16:39:02 2015 UTC,"A conversation I had earlier about the effect of confirmation bias on the perception of XVM sniping made me wonder what a survey would show   Sweet, you set this up.  Lemme go fill it out...  ...OK, back.  One thing I do find interesting is you don't have to use XVM to know who good players are, if you pay attention to names of players and clans. E.g. if I see a player with a tag of BULBA/-G-/PBKAC/RELIC/OTTER/BULLS/etc, I know they're dangerous. Anytime I have a choice in targets, I shoot one of them over other pubbies."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,_taugrim_,5,Mon Jul 20 16:54:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is a good point. Maybe in the future I will do a more thorough survey. There are several questions I thought of that I would have liked to add, but I didn't want to make it a huge survey."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,SilasTheVirous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:13 2015 UTC,You may also want to clarify recent vs overall for WR and WN8.
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,That_Unknown_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:24:56 2015 UTC,Does XVM show overall or recent? (I thought it was the former).
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,_taugrim_,2,Mon Jul 20 19:33:00 2015 UTC,XVM shows overall -- but I believe he was referring to the last question about our wn8 not our targets. I agree that it could be more accurate; for instance my overall is dark green but recent is purple.
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,That_Unknown_Guy,3,Mon Jul 20 20:12:04 2015 UTC,"I admire that you took the time to make this, but I feel as if the potential for non arty players to post due to arty rage, the likelihood of the lack of a decent sample size without moderators stickying this and the absence of actual in game numbers might mean this isnt the most accurate of surveys. Id be very interested in seeing vbaddict collecting actual data to see if purple players are disproportionately hit by artillery and if that rate carries between xvm users and non xvm users though.  That being said, this still will be interesting.  Edit: Hell, Im already curious about the results."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,_taugrim_,3,Mon Jul 20 16:46:43 2015 UTC,"It is an internet survey, so it is basically guaranteed to not be accurate, lol.  Still, it is likely to at least show something, and if nothing else, even poor quality data can be interesting."

WorldofTanks,3dynx8,_taugrim_,2,Mon Jul 20 16:56:03 2015 UTC,I do mind but Il give you a general idea. I have gone down most tank/td lines barring a few ( think ive gone down about 20 in total). I also have gone down the russian arty arty line. Im within 1800-2400 wn8 and 52-56% win rate overall and I definitely have over 20k games...... Recent regular unicum (no super powers).
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,That_Unknown_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"I do mind but Il give you a general idea   Fair enough.   Im within 1800-2400 wn8 and 52-56% win rate overall and I definitely have over 20k games   OK, thanks.  AFAIK, you show up as ""blue"" in XVM then in terms of WN8 and green from a win rate perspective.  Here are a few things to keep in mind:   People, regardless of skill level, don't like getting clicked (obvious point haha). So arties tend to get a lot of hate, period Unicums have often complained that they feel disproportionately clicked by arty over other players   The 2nd point is the rub, at least with players who show up with either purple WN8, or purple win rate, or both in XVM.  I can't provide you any statistics, but I have noticed that in areas where there are multiple other friendly players nearby, there are some very noticeable times when enemy arties preferentially target me repeatedly.  Frankly, it's the smart thing to do, if I'm in an arty-vulnerable position. Why not go after the most dangerous opponents first, if they as vulnerable as other nearby targets?  Keep in mind I'm also not one of the people who runs around whining about ghost shells, getting sh!tty MM more than other people, etc. Objectivity is king to me.  You do not believe that arties preferentially target players based on their skill level, but you're also not purple, so you're not talking from actual experience but rather what you think the experience would be. If you were purple and saying these things, that would be a bit different.  If you spend time on the WoTLabs forum, the Unicums talk a lot about how they are preferentially targeted. I don't think this is just confirmation bias. It simply makes sense."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,_taugrim_,2,Mon Jul 20 17:42:52 2015 UTC,"You do not believe that arties preferentially target players based on their skill level   That is not an accurate summary of my opinion on the topic. I absolutely believe it happens as ive said (edit: In the thread op is referring to) and have experienced. I just dont believe its anywhere near the level its reported at. I think its often used as an excuse for a bad play or arty hate.   If you spend time on the WoTLabs forum, the Unicums talk a lot about how they are preferentially targeted. I don't think this is just confirmation bias. It simply makes sense.   You'd think a blue player would experience it near the same rate when they are the best on both teams then."

I just dont believe its anywhere near the level its reported at   You've experienced it as a blue WN8 player with a green win rate.  It seems like a reasonable statement to say that players with purple WN8 or purple win rate or especially both would be targeted more than you.   You'd think a blue player would experience it near the same rate when they are the best on both teams then   Blue/green doesn't command either the respect or resentment as purple. Not even close.  IMO you are under-estimating the extent of vengeance people like to get on purple players. People die to purple players a lot. No one likes to die. People remember.

WorldofTanks,3dynx8,SilasTheVirous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:58:06 2015 UTC,"Not really.  Purples are purples because they generally make better decisions and make themselves hard-to-kill.  The issue is that a lot of purples tend to be more active / less campy than your typical pubbie, and being more active entails moving away from that rock that protects you from arty."

Unicums having a higher rate of being hit base (which im not sure is true as they should best know how to avoid it even while moving), is unrelated."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,boucem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:05:29 2015 UTC,"I'm always aware of what enemy tanks are purple, blue, and green.  I have almost never gone out of my way to target one, unless the opportunity arises.  In over 28K games, only once have I actively gone out of my way to kill a unicum.  He was single-handily destroying our right flank and had killed four there already.  I was the best player on our team (sadly), and did a quick assessment that this guy had to go.  It's one of the only times, where the game was still in question, that I attacked an opponent with no regard to any other tank than the unicum.  I took my M103 in and attacked him point blank, while being shot by others on his team.  It was such a ridiculous and blatant act, that after I killed him, and was subsequently dispatched by his team, that he wrote in chat, ""Nice sacrifice"".  I responded that, ""I thought my team had a better chance winning without me than your team did without you"".  He responded, ""We'll see"".  I turned out to be correct this time.  What I appreciate about unicums is how aware they are of other's actions and intentions."

WorldofTanks,3dynx8,SilasTheVirous,2,Tue Jul 21 12:58:30 2015 UTC,"You have strong opinions that arty isn't difficult to avoid   It's easy to reduce the odds of being targeted. Even something as simple as tiny direction changes while driving from point A to point B, backing up/moving forwards a tank length while waiting out a reload, or throwing in the occasional variation to your pattern of peeking makes it vastly more likely that artillery will pick a different target.  In the small sample size of people I've talked to who seemed to think that artillery had it in for them all the time, every one of them said that they generally didn't adjust their playstyle to avoid artillery at all (and refused to do so because they hate artillery, which doesn't make sense to me but w/e)."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,dpidcoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:24:57 2015 UTC,Very often players refuse to change their play-style despite being open to artillery; this is due to the fact that the substitute play-style is not nearly as efficient or impact-full.
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,plarpplarp,2,Mon Jul 20 20:18:38 2015 UTC,"this is due to the fact that the substitute play-style is not nearly as efficient   Which is what I don't quite understand. They're willing to do other things that, by the same metric, reduce efficiency. It's just this one thing that's put on a pedestal as something which is not acceptable to make sacrifices in order to mitigate."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,_taugrim_,0,Mon Jul 20 20:25:43 2015 UTC,"What do you specifically refer to when you say ""other things""?  I doubt those other things would involve wasting a few minutes of game play to change your positions to one much less impactfull."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,tmichael921,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:27 2015 UTC,"What do you specifically refer to when you say ""other things""?   Literally anything that doesn't result in instant gratification. e.g. it's ok to have to drive towards someone at a slight angle (therefore closing on them slower) to reduce incoming damage, but heaven forbid I'm required to back up 3 meters while reloading lest an artillery get me.   I doubt those other things would involve wasting a few minutes of game play to change your positions to one much less impactfull.    Why are you spending multiple minutes relocating to avoid artillery? You can make yourself a significantly harder target by randomly altering your path when moving forwards, or moving a few meters in between reloads. If you want to go for 100% mitigation then sure. But by the same token then you should also be annoyed that you need to drive off a cliff or into a lake to avoid direct fire from other tanks."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,dpidcoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:18:03 2015 UTC,They're hedging their moves based on arty inaccuracy.
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,_taugrim_,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:59:29 2015 UTC,"It's easy to reduce the odds of being targeted   Sure. Any Unicum knows this.  A few videos back, I got clicked the only time up to that point I was no longer arty safe. Literally within 10 seconds of having to move away from a wall because I was getting flanked, I got clicked:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFF1K0LXHs8#t=4m41s   In the small sample size of people I've talked to who seemed to think that artillery had it in for them all the time, every one of them said that they generally didn't adjust their playstyle to avoid artillery at all   So you value the opinion of a small sample size of morons?  OK."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,dpidcoe,4,Mon Jul 20 19:39:49 2015 UTC,"look at the video you posted again though, it's not a great example of what you are talking about.  Before you get hit there aren't really any good options on your side of the map for the enemy to shoot at, all you allies are tucked in really well. Yeah he could shoot to the south, but that requires him to turn and if he waits something north is going to have to expose itself.  So he waits, then the t69 rushes you, at this point I'm sure the arty is looking your way because you have already started to back off the wall, I assume at this point he is re-aiming at least to some extent or he would have fired sooner than he did. So now you turn yourself perpindicular to the wall and start to back up in a straight line, directly away from the arty. At this point he is most likely aiming behind you waiting for the circle to close. You then turn slightly to angle for the shot from the other tanks on your right as the t69 dies which requires a slight adjustment from the m12, and finally the su152 drives right behind you. At this point if the arty is at all aimed in which he should be by now, hes going to take the opportunity to get a hit on you or the su, and the shot goes in.  I'd say it's very unlikely that you were targeted for your stats and more because you were slowly backing up, instead of charging forward like the ferdi, you were backing up in a straight line for most of it and because the su go so close it was an attempt at a double hit."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,_taugrim_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:55:59 2015 UTC,Sure. Any Unicum knows this.   And several of them don't actually do anything about it.   So you value the opinion of a small sample size of morons?   I'm pretty sure I didn't value their opinion and also called them morons. That doesn't mean they aren't datapoints though (they were of the blue and purple XVM variety).

In that particular discussion (which went one for quite a while), I got him to explicitly state that refused to change his playstyle to prevent being artied.  The rest of the examples (I believe I did acknowledge a small sample size) were all similar cases, though the discussions happened on various other gaming forums or ingame, so nothing I could give you a concrete example of like what you asked for."

WorldofTanks,3dynx8,Escape_Artist_EUW,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:05:45 2015 UTC,"Many people use XVM for the visual features, like the map. Others just use the stats to avoid good players, or to judge the capacity of their teammates."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,_taugrim_,23,Mon Jul 20 21:10:16 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested to see how many blue/purple players who think they're being XVM sniped are in the first three tanks spotted. Unica tend to play more aggressively than the average player due to a deeper understanding of how the game is likely to flow, and which areas will be key to victory. As a result, they tend to be the first into the action. For the average player who will shoot at the first thing that's lit, this means that higher skill players are going to be focused as a result of being lit first, rather than being XVM sniped. I also think tag sniping is as much of a thing as XVM sniping."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,boucem,3,Mon Jul 20 17:47:15 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with the tag sniping as it feels as it happens more often than XVM sniping in mind. In some situations, it's certain that some arty players are blatantly trying to snipe you down wherever you go in the map. But I feel this is in a way, better for me as my team gets a better survivability rate as not many players know the importance of getting behind arty cover."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,WeaponsGradeHumanity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:02:39 2015 UTC,The obvious cases of XVM sniping can be so infuriating though haha. Like not being one of the first spotted and still have a platoon of LeFH arties after your ass the whole game. At least it takes their attention off my other people.
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,Escape_Artist_EUW,-4,Mon Jul 20 22:30:07 2015 UTC,"Na, good players actually play by not getting spotted in the beginning. Unless you'll get a perfect spot to pop some free shots fast. After that you'll relocate because of the arty or just wait a bit so it would relocate it's aim. Never will SUs going to get spotted first and then just continue wandering around the same spot.  And it's true that you get focused 99,9% of times when you're purple. Doesn't matter if you're driving a t8 100hp is3 and there's a 1k hp e100 with it's ass to arty, they'll still shoot you. You'll get used to it so it's actually great that arty focuses you because it's better for the team. Barely get hit by it anyway. With meds it's maybe once in 150-200 games.  And there are other kind of people who will just yolo suicide into you, just to get some shots in. Dunno what's their logic, maybe they wish to upload the picture to Facebook or smth. 2-3-4 guys just yolo rush to death to kill you. Pretty often there are 1 for 3-4 trades in the beginning."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,Justanaussie,6,Mon Jul 20 18:09:22 2015 UTC,"Na, good players actually play by not getting spotted in the beginning   Actually, a lot of Unicums will go to a forward position early to get spots / early damage.  You do risk getting counter-spotted, but the risk is often worth the reward.   And there are other kind of people who will just yolo suicide into you, just to get some shots in. Dunno what's their logic, maybe they wish to upload the picture to Facebook   Yep.  I was grouped with a baller 140 driver named Droplet, and it was ridiculous how some players went after him - literally driving past other enemy players and exposing themselves to tons of fire - just to fire at him."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,bobcrotch,3,Mon Jul 20 18:27:07 2015 UTC,"It's also worth noting that early spots (the primary goal is to get intel on the enemy team distribution, not spotted damage) are done before the arty even has time to load."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,Justanaussie,0,Mon Jul 20 19:45:54 2015 UTC,This is often true but if the person then sticks around to get damage from that position then he's probably making himself an easy target.
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,Trickv2,2,Tue Jul 21 06:55:44 2015 UTC,"Yea, you do go for first shots, but only if it's safe and you know you'll get out. Also depends on your spawn.  It's not like you're gonna rush infront and start spamming while getting shot back or sitting out on the field against arty.  You'll go, take a shot and get back. So you'd lose the spot and if there are arty players somewhat good, you'll wait a bit for them to relocate to somewhere else."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,michiganspeed,5,Mon Jul 20 18:47:19 2015 UTC,"From an arty perspective there are so many factors to consider when picking targets. Though player skill is one of them it's rarely the only thing to consider.  From a victim perspective it's not only unicums that get constantly targeted. Arty players are often just like other classes, they tunnel on one tank and will not give up until either their target is dead or they are. I've had games in a heavy tank where I'm constantly being shot at by arty no matter where I go, I can even hear them shooting the hard cover I'm behind in some sort of vain attempt to knock it over so they can get to me.  Is there XVM sniping in the game? Yes, there is no doubt there are players out there that will prioritise targets based on XVM. But there is no real way to tell if their arty is targeting because of XVM or because they're tunneling or just because it's the only viable target they have.  Side Note: Arty can really piss me off, not enemy arty as it's part of the game that's unlikely to be removed so I'll live with it. What pisses me off is friendly arty that think this class is a short cut to skill. The ones that take their arty to the dumbest places you can think of (if I had a dollar for every muppet that starts the game driving straight at the enemy...) and the ones that just sit in the one spot and refuse to move to get better angles as the game progresses (hell, some of them don't move at all, just shoot from where they spawned).   They have the biggest gun in that game, they have the potential to greatly influence the outcome of the match and they spend the entire game finding new and improved ways of being completely worthless.  if you want to play with arty then learn how to do it properly, be an actual benefit to the team and stop thinking that top down is how you get good. It's not, it's nowhere near right. Even the best arty players in the game are also good at other classes."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,Sgt_forge__,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:56:12 2015 UTC,I like what you're saying here. XVM sniping is a thing no doubt. I do think a lot of the time arty is going to click whatever they're most likely to hit (I'm looking at you light tank players that bitch at arty for clicking them).  One of the reasons why I hate arty players is because they don't move. Most arty players will pick a lane of fire and shoot at it until they win/lose/die/suicide. On some maps this is almost reasonable I guess. Something I almost never see is arty trying to support the weak flank or a flank that looks like it's going to need help. It's literally the fucking equalizer of the game.  Move your big stupid fucking SPG and equalize. Don't tunnel vision easy shots that don't matter.
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,veilwalker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:03:42 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons why I hate arty players is because they don't move.   That is such a huge bugbear for me. Just tonight I asked our arty to target a T25/2 that was spotting for their arty and basically making a mess of us. The response was ""I can't, he's behind a rock"".  And this came from a FV304 of all tanks. I suggested he move (not as politely as that) but he wasn't having it. The really annoying thing though is that he was already well away from our spawn point, yet he wasn't budging another inch."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,DamienJaxx,3,Tue Jul 21 11:08:56 2015 UTC,Done.   When will you be posting the results?

WorldofTanks,3dynx8,b1gdong,3,Mon Jul 20 16:51:41 2015 UTC,I generally try to shoot the best player in range unless I have the opportunity to kill a tank. Taking a gun off the battlefield usually has higher priority.
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,boucem,3,Mon Jul 20 17:29:28 2015 UTC,"I shoot whats in front of me, its as simple as that. The only time i will focus someone is if they are annoying me or they are my friend and i want to mess with them. XVM sniping is more of a hindrance than anything else, If you plan on wasting your entire match to kill one unicum then you will never become a unicum yourself due to the fact that you are unable to realize that you have just spent an entire match following one person around and ignoring multiple other targets that can still kill your allies."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,KptKrondog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:01:22 2015 UTC,"I agree (not that my agreement is any big thing).  When I see a unicum platoon on the opposite team, I give some thought to where they will most likely be and then if possible go to another corridor to kill off their pubbie support and play my game.  No point in chasing unicums and trying to kill them unless they are directly in front of me and I have no choices. I will fight them if they get in my way but I won't go out of my way to fight them.   You want to hit where your enemy is weak."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,boucem,4,Tue Jul 21 18:44:41 2015 UTC,"If it's a choice between a purple player and some tomato who only knows about the W key, I go for purple every time."

I guess in my point of view, XVM plays a role in who I shoot, but I also take into account other factors like are they a one shot? is their tank scary to where it could pose a problem for the team? are they sitting in the open like a dipshit and deserve a shell on their engine deck? is the flank failing? etc. Lots of factors go into who I choose to shoot, XVM is one of them."

Sure, you make the best gambles, but gambles are just that.  Risk management doesn't mean there is no risk.  And it doesn't mean that a failed gambit is a mistake.  It just means that you were beat."

WorldofTanks,3dynx8,backjacker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:36:42 2015 UTC,"how are unicum players supposed to move at all then, they can't possibly ensure that every trip between cover or anytime they push they aren't going to be spotted until they are arty safe again.  to assume so would be the mistake, yeah you can camp in an arty safe position all game that you seem to think is the way to unicum.  Or you can move around, flank, push, change fire angles, etc and reduce your exposure to arty as much as possible but you can't possibly play the whole game completely arty safe if you aren't just camping base.  edit: want to add another point, if unicum players should be able to avoid arty 100% of the time then we wouldn't even be having this discusion"
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,boucem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:02:03 2015 UTC,"Being a unicum is about controlling and mitigating risks, while maximizing potential rewards. It is impossible to fully do one or the other, let alone both. Arty gets hate because it is a large punishment with very little risk reduction and zero notification for counterplay. Controlling the risk for arty means that your other risks (and rewards) will suffer severely."

WorldofTanks,3dynx8,boucem,2,Mon Jul 20 17:27:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's just a matter of killing the target that will increase your chances of winning the most.   So between a super unicum in a bottom tier medium vs a yellow in a top tier heavy, yeah I'll go for the heavy.   And ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS SHOOT THE LOW HEALTH. LESS GUNS R GUD."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,tmichael921,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:31:10 2015 UTC,Why would you waste a 2k hp shell on someone with 100hp? I would rather soften up a bigger target.
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,boucem,2,Mon Jul 20 19:49:06 2015 UTC,"Because a tank with 1 HP is just as capable of doing damage as a full health one. It goes with the whole ""play for the win, not damage"" mentality. Are you going to be selfish and just go for your own benefit, or play for the team's benefit?  The fact that I had to explain this is kind of concerning."

Countless times I've rolled right past a low health tank after putting him on said health and trusted my teammates to finish him off only for me to be reload and have to finish him off myself because the people behind me were incompetent.   Or... they've killed everyone because nobody was willing to ""waste"" a shell on a low hp target.  This is... like... focus fire 101. C'mon."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,plarpplarp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:25:01 2015 UTC,"And relying on your allies to do anything you actually expect is a huge mistake.  You aren't just playing against the enemy team in this game, its  fight against the enemy while having to deal with a team that most likely is going to do exactly the opposite of anything you would expect.  If you have an opportunity to remove a gun from the other team then do it, unless you have platoon mates you can actually rely on to kill the enemy."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,Beldacar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:07:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know what teams you are getting, but in my experience one-shots are very rarely allowed to escape.

But those are exceptions, not the rule"
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,newarchivist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:06:29 2015 UTC,"Then you are the only person in the game that gets reliable players on their team, most people that play this game might as well have their heads shoved up each others asses, while they blindly smack at the keyboard and mouse.  Getting a gun off the enemy team will be more beneficial than hitting the full health unicum 99 times out of 100, when there are less targets for your teammates they can focus fire more efficiently and take less damage at the same time and as arty you hit them indirectly and don't force an ally to expose to get the kill."

WorldofTanks,3dynx8,Ibisstudios,2,Tue Jul 21 13:18:50 2015 UTC,"I use XVM primarily to judge the ideas, plans, and general competence of the players on my own team. If a purple suggests a plan, I'll try to follow it. If a red suggests a plan, I'll ignore it. ""Any plan is better than no plan"" only goes so far when the person proposing the plan has proven that their plans don't seem to work consistently (or consistently don't seem to work).  If a purple goes somewhere and I'm in a tank that can properly support him, I'll make an effort to support him. And if I run into a purple enemy, I'll take that into account when fighting him (i.e., I won't count on him to make a mistake, I'll call my platoon mates to assist, etc.)."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,showman_101,2,Mon Jul 20 17:37:53 2015 UTC,"I don't use XVM because I think it's information overload. I have enough to think about and I can usually judge if a player is good by watching some of what they do in game - that helps determine whether or not I can depend on them. But mostly, I am not good enough to determine that and/or get myself to the right spots to help the right people. Additionally, when I had XVM, I would notice the ""good"" players red-line sniping, padding, etc., so I got sick of that. When I had XVM, I did not use it in target prioritization.  Now-a-days, I look for names I recognize, clan tags that mean they are pretty decent, and tells like that. I don't get a lot of that since I'm still in the mid-tiers."
WorldofTanks,3dynx8,Superirish19,2,Mon Jul 20 17:52:14 2015 UTC,"I will sometimes use XVM to help me decide what targets to engage, and how to engage them. For example, for example if I am in a medium or light, and engaging a heavy that I just barely can circle to death, I will be far more likely to try to do so with a player that is worse according to XVM. A purple player would make me more hesitant to try more agressive manouvers since I will be afraid that he will outplay me instead.  Your survey has no option for using XVM to know what (purple) targets to not engage... Also the selection of players from this subreddit is probably not very representative of the general population. Or even not representative of the XMV-using population."

The way i usually do it is, i'll pick the top 3 enemy tanks via WN8 score. If i see them in the first 3 minutes, i'll try to take them out early; but only if i have a decent shot and good cover. Otherwise, it's first come first serve for how i target enemies. After that 3 minute limit, it's a free for all. I recently had a match against LynxB and one of his friends in IS-6's. Both guys have decent scores. They pushed on a weak flank and i took them out first. My team still lost, but it was a much closer match as a result. By the way i was in a M40/43 with the 8 inch gun."

WorldofTanks,3e3b39,Peddyslate,6,Tue Jul 21 17:07:12 2015 UTC,"To begin with, seeing your stats going up, but winrate going down is often a sign of playing too passively, or waiting too late to make a move.  You then find that the battle is ""decided"" and yea, you might farm up some damage and low health kills, but the snowball leading to the loss has begun.  To improve, you have to apply the mechanics you learned to help influence battles earlier, or at critical times.  Mechanics are good to know, but understanding the pace of battle, critical flanks, strong positions, reading your team deployments, etc are all more important for winning.  You should try to watch how unica deploy and understand why - don't blindly copy, but think, ""why did they go here?""  or ""why did they retreat two minutes before this flank fell?""  Those kinds of big picture decisions matter.  Best places to learn this stuff outside of giving a deep analysis of your play is to watch good streamers like Zeven play, where they explain where they are going and (most importantly) why they are going there, or why they leave a flank.  In addition, find some folks to platoon with who are around, or slightly above your level, to see how they perform and see what you can apply to yourself."

Thinking critically, take a look at other streamers who don't narrate as well as Zeven. I've been watching Trobs a bit because it makes me think more about why Trobs goes where Trobs does.

Tier 5/6 is low enough that you aren't punished with death for every little mistake you make, but tanks are sufficiently specialized so that you can start to see some of the roles and patterns that will become more well defined in later tiers.  You should take your time here and get used to the meta that you're just starting to see.  Your stats are actually pretty good for the number of battles you have so you don't need to spend too long at tier 5.  Just don't go rushing up the tiers either."

One thing I'm noticing is that you have a higher winrate in your heavily armored tanks (KV-85, M4 Jumbo), but have a much lower winrate in the Cromwell. Ask yourself what you are doing differently in each of these. How is your game play affected? Where are you going and being decisive in the heavily armored tanks?  As context, my winrate has been hovering between 51.5% and 52.25% for a long time as I move up the ranks. My performance has gotten worse in Tier 6 v. Tier 5, but that's also because I am pushing myself to try new things and learn new playstyles (like where I shoot a Super Pershing, for example)."

Hull down and sidescraping I can do in a heavy, but with all that armor and hit points I can afford to take a few punches, but still win the duel.  I think it is bloody hard to flank properly in fast tanks. Timing it so that I dont expose myself and gets noticed when I dart up. I can flank my target, but way too often someoone else is aware of me - sometimes surprisingly far away! I should seriously also try and find something better to do than active scouting... At these tiers, there's also too many who can lead a shot pretty good, and the Crommie isn't very small.  I want to do better in fast mediums! It's dull to be good in heavies :P"

I mean, at less than 2k battles, most of us were probably at your level and below tier 5 doesn't really matter for stats, because it's just brawlfests everywhere.  What really helped me is that before every battle, I looked at the allied and enemy tanks, and tried to determine where each of them goes. After a while, you can predict pubbie movements fairly well (although sometimes the tomatoes go to the absolute worst places, but XVM helps with that)."

It seems like you're grasping mechanics, what you need to focus on now is grasping game flow and that really only comes with more experience.

I played loads of tank companies with them, learned how to fight as part of a team, padded the hell out of my winrate, and eventually got on the major league team. We had a dispute that made me leave, following a friend from the clan to...  REL-A, my first clan war clan in October 2013. Somehow I got in with the JPE as my only tier 10, and was able to cut my teeth on clan wars there until I got 4 total tier tens.once that happened, I was promoted to...  REL_3 in January 2014, where I have been since. We have a lot to be proud of, being a top 20 clan and doing very well in clan wars and competitions.

WorldofTanks,3dzcci,Siriothrax,9,Tue Jul 21 02:12:15 2015 UTC,"In order to get into Otter, I shamelessly used /u/trobsmonkey as streamer armor to attract all of the artillery shells as I farmed stets.  Jokes aside, my progression looked like this.   Got into the game due to a few friends from EVE hyping it back in 2012. Like EVE, it was a methodical and unforgiving game. Unlike EVE, I could actually get fights anytime I wanted. After six or seven months, their interest waned, but I was getting half decent at the game after failing my way through 4k battles. The conclusion was simple: I needed a clan. I found a good recommendation on Failheap Challenge (EVE forum) to join Vorbilde Panzergruppe (VPG). VPG wasn't a super competitive clan, but it put its time in to try and improve, and had a decent CW track history as well as aspirations to greater success. I went through an evaluation period platooning with the recruiters, and impressed them enough (""they sent me a newbie, and it turns out he was an ex-SEAL team six member"") that they let me in.   While there, I met /u/haroldsax (aka Gyarados) as well as a few other players (Tai Paktu, Raigir, Yvela) who helped me become much, much better. I believe over the course of six to eight months of platooning in that group, our averages shot up to the 58-60% range.   Eventually, the four of us departed VPG due to internal struggles, and Gyarados used his connections to get us a shot at recruitment into Forge. That was my first exposure to being in a top tier clan, as well as the calling of FCs like Barroom, Nagatron, and Pope_Shizzle. While I was a decent pub star before that, I now had to buckle down and work as a cohesive member of the team. We went through several wars, the largest being the SCC server war, and the funniest being Barroom returning certain clans their knives.   Of course, Forge eventually died, and when that happened, my motivation for tanks was pretty low. I spent about two years (barring a brief return to play in PBKAC with Gyarados for the M60 campaign) playing MWO before I burned out on that game, and came back to tanks. At this point, Gyarados had been duped into running PBKAC, and he was happy to have my purpleness back. Yvela and company had burned out and no longer played ""this terrible game"" (Raigir's words, but now he plays WoWs...wut) or got suckered into fantasy sexy roleplaying (Yvela, the Witcher). It took me a good six months before I was feeling back on top of my game and making positive progress.   Then I decided I wanted to be super cereal, leapfrogged to super-uni recent WN8 by abusing Trobs, and backstabbed Gyarados by joining Otter. No regrets.   tl;dr Pubbed with friends, got into CW with middling clan, got gud, leveraged friend's connections to get into top 3 clan, got gudder, break, nepotismed into top 10 clan, got guddest, applied for top 3 clan.   Edit: to answer the op a little more directly - relentless, but honest, self-improvement was the key. Aspire to be perfect, work at it, but don't beat yourself up. A friend from MWO always described the mentality as ""practice as you would play"". It can be strenuous at first, but eventually it becomes ingrained second nature. Learn how to avoid tilt, how to relax and get off tilt, or if needs be take a break so that it doesn't eat at you."

It means I do really well in some tanks (AMX 30P) and terrible in others (Light tanks, TDs) so it ends up balancing in the middle. Typically I figure out how to play the tanks i'm bad in, but it's a long time after they damage my stats."

My choice to go with PBKAC over other clans was influenced more by knowing friends who were already in the clan than their decision was biased by knowing me, if that makes sense. We've had to reject friends before since they just didn't measure up (and recommended them to subclams to get better). And I don't think it was just for the campaign, but I got burnt out again pretty fast afterwards."

WorldofTanks,3dzcci,Turkey-Vulture,9,Mon Jul 20 23:22:57 2015 UTC,"As a blunicum, it came down to reputation. When I ran VPG I was very honest, very straight in all of my diplomatic dealings and we were able to drag a 50% quality team to a series of victories we probably shouldn't have had due to a few very central callers and players that were a crux of everything.  When I left VPG, I joined Forge (when it was still really good) and I just met a ton of people during that time. When I was in VPG I didn't have a lot of outside the clan relationships, but joining Forge I hung out with people who were in Anvil (duh), PBKAC, -G-, RELIC, and varying other clans.   I got into PBKAC (being top-tier is a matter of perspective, I guess, but I think we're up there) because when I came back from a 9-month hiatus to find Forge dead, all of my friends were in PBKAC and I offered to call. I started calling during the first campaign, and kept taking on responsibilities because I was the most fresh officer, I hadn't been burdened by administration of any kind for well over a year at that point. It took somewhere around 8 months, but I was eventually invested with equal authority to Ziddy (inside of the clan, at least). I'm still in PBKAC, and running it, basically because of a sense of duty. I know, I know, that sounds corny but I really like the guys in my clan and I feel responsible for their enjoyment in the game insofar as making it a little easier on them."

WorldofTanks,3dzcci,iPwnForYou,4,Mon Jul 20 20:33:38 2015 UTC,"There's no right or wrong way to do it.  Essentially, the plan to get into a top clan is 1) Get good.  2)  Prove you are good.  3) Don't be an asshat.  Clans put different values on these things: some care more about pub stats, some more about your play in evaluations, and some about how you are as a person.  You can take any number of paths to get your 1-2-3 in line to join a top tier clan.  Joining social clans, improving your play, learning what you like and dislike, and gaining experience is a very common and popular way to do it.  Get better.  Meet people.  Find people you like and people who like you.  Join a clan with players of similar interests and skill."
WorldofTanks,3dzcci,shutupshake,2,Mon Jul 20 20:48:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly probably not. Social clans are fun as hell but if you want to get into RDDT go strait to NARWL if your stats are good enough and work your way from there. It is true however that these clans want ""previous clan wars experience"" and being in another RDDT clan is a good way to get accepted because than they will know you have a basic idea of the ""Reddit way of doing things"" and not some trash a random clan taught you. That being said just apply strait to NARWL and chances are if you are good enough they will accept you regardless of experience."
WorldofTanks,3dzcci,Siriothrax,3,Mon Jul 20 20:56:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a RDDT recruiter. We do recruit from socials albeit rarely. A key requirement for recruitment is significant CW experience. We need recruits that can hit the ground running on CW. We are not a training clan. That said, most social clans don't do enough CW to build that needed experience. There are exceptions for socials that do a lot of stronghold skirmishes or tourneys because although they aren't CW, it does prove the recruits are familiar with teamplay.   That said, don't think socials are out of the question. I would recommend joining one to get a feel for the community. If you like it, consider moving up to an entry level RDDT CW clan. Keep improving and gaining experience from there and the jump to RDDT would be easy."

I ripped this from my reply lower down. Here's the thing: can you honestly focus on dedicating yourself to the above values while in a social clan, or are you going to get distracted from getting good? If you can train yourself up while playing in a social, more power to you. However, I find it more likely that you'll have a difficult time finding a similar attitude and camaraderie to help boost yourself upwards. Playing with likeminded platoon-mates is a huge boon, as you can get valuable feedback on your play and you won't feel like you're chafing against the culture of your clan."

I was in a pretty bad clan when I started just because my friend was in it and he convinced me to join. Other than the occasional tank company, 36% of which I won, I didn't do much with that clan, but I slowly learned to play, so that when the clan started to collapse, I had about 1800 recent and I applied to RDDT.  I got into RDDT, and from playing with people there, and learning as I did, I gradually improved. In particular, one big lecture from one of the officers where he told me that when I died it was because I fucked up really got me thinking about how I play, and I just kept learning and improving as I played more. By the time I had been in RDDT for 6 months, around the time of the 3rd campaign, I was approaching 2800 recent, I had learned a little CW play (although I wasn't a regular player).   In the aftermath of the 3rd campaign, RDDT had an exodus where the CW active core mostly left to HDU, and I stayed to see the clan move to fighting in Africa. As we did, I realised that there wasn't much point in me being in a CW clan if I hated turning up for it, but felt bad about not doing so. I started watching a lot of twitch because I was worried about plateauing at 2800 recent, by doing this I made a few friends in BULBA on NA, and playing with them realised how much I could improve my game by playing with very good players, and I wanted to find a more laid back, higher level Pub/SH orientated clan on EU, so I left RDDT. I had always wanted to join S3AL one day, and I has assumed that I would be leaving RDDT the day that happened, but after talking to some people (but apparently not the right ones), I thought that getting into S3AL wouldn't be possible, so I joined a newly formed good social clan called LAVA.  I had been meaning to message the commander of S3AL (who I knew a little through twitch) to ask to join his clan for some time, but had not done so because I had been led to believe that I would be rejected, but eventually after I had been in LAVA for a month or so, I decided to go for it, and he said ""I'll put you on our waiting list"" very shortly after I was asked to join the clan, and I waved LAVA a sad goodbye.  Sorry if this is waay too long for you. I started typing and it kind of got out of hand.  TL;DR:  Pubbed and obsessed over mechanics until 1800 recent. Joined RDDT, platooned with good people and soloed until 2800 recent. Started watching twitch and platooning with very good players which taught me a fair bit more. Joined a good SH/pub social clan briefly before moving to S3AL where I wanted to end up."
WorldofTanks,3dzcci,Gwennifer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:19 2015 UTC,"Seems networking is a common theme among players who looked to move up to better clans, and platooning with good players instrumental in breaking plateaus/helping them step up their game. You clearly found some great platoon mates through twitch, would you have any other advice for finding good platoon mates to feed off each others knowledge and improve? It's quite hard to surround yourself with high level players when you don't yet have the stats to put yourself into a high level environment."
WorldofTanks,3dzcci,Nokijuxas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:55:21 2015 UTC,"well, when you join a clan you can't expect to be the best guy there, so join a clan, and leave once you've got nothing left to learn. Join another clan with people to learn from. Watch twitch too, that helps."

I would platoon with people i knew were better than me and i would ask them if they had any tips about how to get gud. Otherwise i would observe their game play and do the same thing with twitch streamers. It took me over a year to go from narwl to Otter. Don't expect it to be easy but its definitely not impossible lol. ALSO while im here ill self advertise :3. http://www.twitch.tv/liter0fcola (Ask me anything and ill give you the answers you seek)

That clan split off into the short lived CFS, then I joined-J- for the first campaign with a few friends. After being clan-less for awhile I joined CHAI for the second and third campaign. After that I decided I wanted to join my fellow English speaking friends in BULBA and I have been here ever since.

WorldofTanks,3dzcci,Seeriath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:53:05 2015 UTC,"The first clan I was in was when World of Tanks first came out on the NA server. It was a friends clan (UDIE), I learned a lot from the really great players there and moved onto the Goon Squad clans (SDP and NDP). After we lost the great war I got into CRABS, that's when my stats went from dark blue to purple. Turns out even though you are not a unicum, when you have a reputation of being a good player you can get into clans that are considered top tier. I did not have the stats for CRABS, but my former officers vouched for the fact that I shut the fuck up and listen to callers. After MacD ruined CRABS with his giant mouth I joined OTTER and been here ever since.   If you want to join a top tier clan you need two things: Great stats and the ability to shut the fuck up and listen. If a caller tells you to rush to your death, you ask how hard to push. Platoon up with your clan mates and don't be a whiney cunt. We all lose, yes it sucks but don't be a shit about it. People want to platoon to joke around and have fun, not be brought down by Negative Nancy. It might not seem like it is a big deal, but people will want to platoon with you and you will start to build a reputation for being a good player. People will vouch for you if you want to move away from a casual clan to a competitive one."

WorldofTanks,3e2zuk,Dactylic126,4,Tue Jul 21 15:49:54 2015 UTC,"If you are from NA I recommend that you send this replay to WG. That IS5 was a complete ass. You can see that he shoots the IS6 earlier in the game too just because IS6 tried to get in position by crossing in front of him.   Not to mention that he seems to be full of himself and have no regards for the team. He was completely blocking the path when he could've sidescraped (was he even? his positioning was a bit weird) a bit further up letting allies pass through. Yes, bumping into others when they're preparing a shot is wrong, but in your case I believe its somewhat justified. That IS-5 was sitting there forever so from your perspective it could've seemed like he was just sitting in wait and not engaged. Try to communicate through chat first instead of bumping next time though. Not that this specific IS-5 would've listened, but with normal people you'll get through.  Also, great job in not shooting back and moving on. Shame immature people tend to ruin the game for everyone.   Edit: Actually I gave it a second watch with sounds on and caught something I haven't earlier. He wasn't moving because he was tracked. He didn't use repair kit so he was waiting while tracks got repaired and trying to fire back the moment KT popped out again, which is when you bumped him. Though he was being inconsiderate in both positioning and in teamwork, you should always pay attention to your allies around you. Like mentioned before, ask in chat if you need passage before bumping (and only tap them if it seems to be the only way, or just go around if you can) unless its a non-combat situation. Still, hope you have more enjoyable allies in your other games."

The only sorts of people I cannot reliably hit are the ones who are chilling in the back CHAI sniping unlit. The shots I miss are almost always because I have shit aim, not RNG. Basically, if there is arty on the team and they decide to go for a target it is royally fucked."
WorldofTanks,3dy88v,clintp,4,Mon Jul 20 20:08:25 2015 UTC,"I came here to say this.  I play my Pz.Sfl.IVb at least one game per session and it's given me a lot of insight into bad habits I have as a regular tanker.  The wide aiming arc lets me get a good view of the entire playfield and it's easier to keep track of tanks without moving my tracks as they move.  I'm not good at it (although I had a multi kill night the other night, lots of 1-shots, thank you RNGesus) but at least I know what to expect when I'm on the other side.  Two concrete tips: 1. If you hear/see the arty hit near you, MOVE.  NOW.  With multiple arty on the other side, if you were a sweet target for one, you can bet your ass the other is aiming at you too.  2. Avoid tunnel vision.  Most of my arty kills come from watching two or three tanks trading shots in the open.  That tank in your sights isn't the only one aiming at you, I am too or trying because I know you're not paying attention to anything else."
WorldofTanks,3dy88v,Kulgur,9,Mon Jul 20 15:43:24 2015 UTC,"Rocking back and forth over the same patch of ground is a terrible way to try and dodge artillery fire. As is driving in a straight line. As is snaking the same amount to each side. As is ridge poking the same spot over and over and over again. As is very obviously following roads/tracks/paths at a more or less constant speed. People almost never move as randomly as they think they do.  Extra negative points if you are rocking back and forth towards and away from where the arty is, so he can just fire and almost certainly hit you SOMEWHERE.  Also don't assume the enemy arty wont move. A lot of the worse players wont, the better ones will move around to get a shot."

WorldofTanks,3dy88v,dpidcoe,2,Mon Jul 20 16:56:52 2015 UTC,"Or engage your deflector shields and go to warp fast!  Seriously, as Graybe (aka You ""Monster!"" put it), play it a bit. Knowing how to counter something means learning how to use it. Otherwise, learn hard cover, follow better players and above all KEEP MOVING and not in a STRAIGHT LINE. As a random arty scumbag, if you pull over a crest to peek or shoot, roll back one track length and stop, I'll rain pain down every time.  I don't use XVM to pick targets as most. I pick targets that pop up first, heavies or TD's with big guns and any lights I see making a run for arty in that order. I'll take that shot at your last known position before I relocate my cursor since I have to wait for the bloom to reduce anyway."
WorldofTanks,3dy88v,MoarVespenegas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:39:56 2015 UTC,"Random movements over short intervals.  For simplicities sake, assume a given tank can instantly accelerate to a speed of 2m/s in either a forwards or backwards direction and is defending against an artillery with a 3 second shell travel time from his firing position, a high shell arc, and perfect accuracy.  If you begin moving forwards at a constant 2m/s, that means the artillery is now aiming 6 meters in front of where you are at that given moment in order to hit.   Best case for you is that you happen to throw it into reverse the instant they fire, at which point you'll be 12m away from the impact zone. Worst case is that you continue forwards for 3 seconds and get nailed. Medium case is that you initiated the movement change not in sequence with their shot and end up somewhere in the middle with splash damage.  So in this simplified model, the key thing in that you enact an abrupt change in direction as close to the instant they fire as possible. Wait too long and you drive into their predicted path. Don't wait long enough and you don't impart enough of a position change to do much (as well as interfere with your own aiming).  In an actual ingame model, you also want to take into account shell arc + direction of travel, the fact that most artillery will aim at a point just past your tank, the time it takes the other player to observe and predict your movement (i.e. are you going to continue in a straight line or are you just peeking), terrain, and cover (if you're in cover but keep peeking from the same spot, I'll just shoot there about when I think you're done reloading regardless of your movement).  In most of the mediums that I drive I've found that when out in the open, doing a little forward/reverse maneuver in between reloads (with some randomness in interval and exact direction thrown in) works quite well for dodging shots. It's definitely not going to avoid all of them, but it raises the odds enough to make a difference or get them to pick an easier target."
WorldofTanks,3dy88v,dpidcoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:54:16 2015 UTC,Be in hard cover if you're a slow tank. Drive erratically with stops and starts as a fast tank.
WorldofTanks,3dy88v,Kulgur,3,Tue Jul 21 05:50:05 2015 UTC,"Rocking back and forth over the same patch of ground is a terrible way to try and dodge artillery fire   As someone who plays artillery a lot, I potentially disagree (depending on exactly how you're defining ""rocking""). Obviously it becomes completely ineffective if you're backing up in line with the shell (especially for the low arc artilleries), or not moving fast enough/far enough. But as your angle becomes more perpendicular it gets annoying enough that I'm going to find an easier target to risk a 40 second reload on.  Under the right circumstances, if you move far enough to be out of the splash zone (1-2 tank lengths) and keep the movements random and well timed, it becomes near impossible to hit you."
WorldofTanks,3dy88v,dpidcoe,2,Mon Jul 20 19:31:32 2015 UTC,"Rocking is.... rocking. Moving slightly repeatedly over the same spot at the same interval. A lot of people don't even move the length of their tank (so if the arty aims at the right spot they never fully leave his aim), then act surprised when they get artied."
WorldofTanks,3dy88v,mistralol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:43:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, looks like we have the same definition of rocking then. Back and forth movement doesn't become effective until you start displacing more than one tank length on a consistent basis."
WorldofTanks,3dy88v,PlanetaryGenocide,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:07:27 2015 UTC,Yup it needs to be something like this (in tank lengths). Back 2 forward 5. back 1 forward 2 back 6 and so on..
WorldofTanks,3dy88v,dpidcoe,7,Tue Jul 21 10:15:38 2015 UTC,"Camp behind arty-safe cover, ironically.  Semi-sarcasm aside, unpredictable movements are nice if you're in a fast, mobile tank.  Yes, you're less likely to be shot at anyways (unless you're blue/purple), but people still will go for light tanks and the like if nothing else is spotted.  Don't just zigzag, make outright 90-degree course changes, weave through bushes and rocks and shit, double back on your path, do everything in your power to make the clicker's aim jump all over the place  Also arty tends to shoot at you the moment you go dark, so if you know for a fact that you're about to go dark, changing course or even outright stopping right at that point will sometimes result in a shell hitting where you would have been had you not done so."
WorldofTanks,3dy88v,That_Unknown_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:08 2015 UTC,"Also arty tends to shoot at you the moment you go dark   We also know that people like to drive behind trees and bushes, and will often shoot the most convenient tree/bush for you to have driven behind after you went dark. You can sometimes exploit this in a fast tank by knocking over a tree as if you were coming to a stop and trying to hid behind it, then backing out asap and causing a wasted shot."
WorldofTanks,3dy88v,similar_observation,5,Mon Jul 20 20:01:19 2015 UTC,"From a previous comment Ive made:   I play similarly to how I regularly play with a few exceptions. A lot of people think arty is unavoidable, but that just isnt true most of the time. Of course youll still get hit, but not nearly as much as many report and even less if you do a few simple things. Firstly, and this is more important for slightly faster tanks, I never travel in a straight line and do my best to drive perpendicular to enemy arty firing arcs requiring them to re aim more often. Secondly, I make sure some other sucker on my team is an easier target than I am. What that usually means is im just that little bit more in cover than them when arty is close to being loaded or I am moving the most erratically then. Thirdly, I push aggressively as arty wins the war of attrition (especially true for team game modes). Lastly I played an arty line all the way through to the ten. From this I learned the previous tips and more particularly, how to make myself less attractive (Im almost as good as I am irl) by  being in positions which I wouldnt regularly aim at in arty and moving when I think arty will start to re aim."

WorldofTanks,3dy88v,nbsdx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:15:22 2015 UTC,"I've also used my normal tanking experience to apply to artillery. Knowing the typical hiding spots, firing alleys, and map angles help dictate the most likely target rich environments. And vice versa, it tells me where I should avoid going or begin counter battery.  Case and point. Pearl River.  J9-0 & K9-0 (bottom right) is a alcove and typical hiding spot for artillery. That spot also allows fire into the middle of the map, as well as A7, B8-9 & C8-9.  Attacking from the North, I would know that certain spots of the middle and northern route open me to artillery fire. As an artillery, I know that I could counter-battery by lobbing into the K0 alcove. Playing artillery from the south, I know I could camp from this area, but it'll be watched by enemy players. And as an attacking tank. I know that my arty in the alcove can support my attack route.   Just got to observe what's going on. There's a lot of minutia to digest."
WorldofTanks,3dy88v,Captainplankface,5,Tue Jul 21 06:49:25 2015 UTC,"I play a fair bit of Arty, so here's my take on avoiding the evil crosshairs of scumbags like me.   Mobility If you're not in decent cover that you know is safe, stay as mobile as possible. The bane of artillery is its aiming time so they'll be looking for tanks that require the least amount of aiming to hit. If you're sitting still and give arty the time to focus in on you, its down to RNG if they hit or not. If you're on the move and potentially going to cause them to dramatically shift their aim or turn their tracks then they'll be less likely to waste time on you and pick another target, or even just rush the shot and miss. Make it as difficult and frustrating for them as possible. Visibility Arty rely on other tanks to spot for them - if you're not spotted you're relatively safe. I say relatively as they will be looking for destructible terrain being hit, or dead tanks being pushed or even guess at your predicted location if you were just spotted and disappeared - so some will blind fire at you. Avoid running into trees, fences, small buildings, walls, etc... and don't hide in bushes until you're sure you're unspotted. If you are spotted for a reasonable amount of time then assume that some artillery could be focusing in on you. Do your best to stay near hard cover or keep mobile so you make yourself a harder/less-interesting target for them. Even the smallest rock, ridge, building or dead tank can take a shell that was aimed at you. Location, location, location Good arty players know the maps. They know the positions where they can hide that give them the best coverage of specific and important areas of the map. These areas are those locations where everyone knows that tanks go to - heavy brawling spots, common scouting bushes, common TD sniping points. Generally, if you can't see any red dots on your minimap than neither can the enemy arty. Which means they'll either be focusing in on one of those areas or aiming at the last location they fired at. Quite often they'll literally be waiting for someone to poke their nose around a corner before sending 1250+ plus of HE in their general direction. So if you're in one of or heading too those locations, keep an eye on your minimap. The lack of spotted targets can mean you'll be rolling into an area that an arty is pre-aimed at, so as above be aware, be mobile and make it difficult for them. Aggression If you've made it into the mid-game without being one-shotted then you can potentially hassle the arty. Good SPG players will scuttle away from flanks or areas that their team have lost, or are in danger of losing. If you can push near their favourite hiding places and make them run away then you're wasting their valuable aiming time. On the right kind of map, forcing a scumbag to move can make them waste about 2+ minutes re-locating to a safe spot, turning around and re-aiming. That's time that effectively makes you and your allies arty-safe no matter where you are. Plus if you do manage to spot them, it gives your own arty the chance to do some counter-battery fire which is sooooooo much safer than risking a shot-gunning from a group of defensive arties."
WorldofTanks,3dy88v,boucem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:17:16 2015 UTC,"Adding on to your aggression point as a frequent SPG player: a few ways to make this even more effective.    Make sure your own SPGs know you're making a run if you want support (and give them ~60 seconds warning so they can aim and reload). Have them ping the square they're aiming at. If you do spot enemy artillery and have friendly artillery support, wait 3-4 seconds before taking a shot unless you're sure you can one-shot or track them. If you shot them the second they're spotted, they'll start moving about the same time your own artillery shoots, likely resulting in a miss. They'll only reposition if they see you coming. If you're trying to force a repositioning, allchat can be your friend."
WorldofTanks,3dy88v,Fuckanator,4,Mon Jul 20 20:10:58 2015 UTC,"Make friend with big rock.   Or just don't stop moving. Juke around while reloading, don't sit still, move unpredictably, SERPENTINE, don't fire from the same place more than once or twice in a row. Re-position during reload. Assume that once you get lit, you have 6 seconds before getting smacked - once your 6th sense goes off, abruptly change direction.   If you can keep one of the enemy arty busy, then a) it pisses them off because they're missing, and b) they aren't bothering with your team.   I had a game on Prokhorovka where the enemy Bat.-Châtillon 155 58 decided he should deal with me (T32) who was out in the middle of the map taking shots over the ridge and into the hill on the east. He dropped 3 clips into me, hit me once, and both flanks fell apart because they had no fire support. All I did was drive around behind the rock and hills to unlight, then pop out, aim real quick or just snapshot, and then retreat.  I guess I should add ""(ab)use vision mechanics"" to the above list."

WorldofTanks,3dy88v,Black_RL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:20 2015 UTC,"Be aware of arty (are you the only one spotted? Are they paying attention to something that was spotted a moment ago?)  Move erratically. Not back and forth. Like move, turn a little, stop moving, move forward again and then don't stop. It's rarely good to move backward unless you have a great reverse speed. Moving erratically throws off the high arc arties.  Find approaches that present a difficult angle. This minimizes the chances for low arc arties - they're more likely to hit terrain or overshoot.  Present your tank at an angle so that even IF you get hit, you aren't gonna be a one shot.  After you are spotted and arty attempt to hit you, lie low for a while. They will stick to you and by not showing up you waste their time. Try to tease them by showing up the moment they've started to focus on another target.  Don't drive heavies.  Be lucky.  Play arty to get a feeling for all of these things. Also learn arty's favourite aim spots per map and play around it in your normal games."

WorldofTanks,3dy88v,Wakka_bot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:06:39 2015 UTC,"The players I hit with my arty are usually playing as though they don't even know arty is in play.  The first thing I do when a match begins is check how many arty are on the other team.  It totally changes my play style if there is or is not any in the match.  If there is arty then I hug terrain features that make me an unappealing target.  No one wants to waste time trying to hit a guy behind a rock.  Peek out to draw a shot if you think you're targeted.  It takes a couple seconds for the round to arrive so stick your head out, wait a two count and pull back.  If you were a target the shot will land and you can move out to a new spot, if you weren't a target then you can drive off in a different direction than you poked (just to be safe).  If there is no arty in play then its game on and you can drive around freely.  Its a very liberating feeling.  When I'm playing as arty I am really just looking at the map for the guys who are in the open.  Never be in the open.  Be aware of which side of the map your arty is on and know that in most cases the enemy is on that same side at the start and most arty don't like to drive far before the start to track targets.  Keep that angle in mind on the map when you choose cover.  I almost never die from arty fire."

WorldofTanks,3dy88v,biskit64,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:45 2015 UTC,"1) Try to ignore it unless they start focusing you 2) Try to watch out, whether enemy arty shot somewhere and is reloading for the next 30-40 seconds, so you have more freedom to move in the open terrain (even if its 1 out of 2/3 of them) 3) Always try to get unsupported before crossing open terrain/driving to a new map location, esp. if its unspotted area, not only do you make arty harder to lead/aim, but you also avoid ambushes/red line snipers seeing you and starting pre-aiming that location as well. 3) If you are spotted and arty been shooting area near you, try to move forward/backwards at least few times and get unspotted, then change location to slightly different from your previous spot, so they can't stay pre-aimed there as effective."

WorldofTanks,3dy88v,Fuckanator,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:34:55 2015 UTC,"Playing arty yourself will give you an understanding about how they work (or don't work) but it can be a serious commitment to get to a level where you're competent enough in arty to truly know how best to avoid them.  So lets just try the basics for now. Here are some simple rules for avoiding arty.  Rule #1. Make yourself harder to hit than your teammates.  I know, that's pretty callous hoping arty will shoot your teammates instead of you but if they want to make themselves easy targets then that's their problem. So if you have teammates doing stupid things like standing out in the open admiring the flowers then the chances of arty targeting you just dropped.   Rule #2. Be erratic.   Arty has lots of deficiencies, one of them being shell flight time. If their target is moving then they have to anticipate where that target will be by the time their shell gets there. If you drive back and forth in a straight line to the same two points over and over then you're making life easy for them. If you have no choice but to drive back and forth in a straight line then vary where you stop and reverse direction, vary your speed if possible. otherwise try to move in a varied style like in a serpentine motion (but don't keep duplicating it, that's just as bad).  Also when most tanks fire the first thing they do is back up. If you backup the same amount each time then not only are you telling arty where you will be going but how much time it's going to take for you to get there and what time you're starting your motion.  Rule #3. Know where arty is.   This is a lot easier if you learn how to play arty yourself but if you don't want to go that way then pay attention to where arty on your team goes on that particular map. Next time you play that map from the other spawn point you will have a rough idea of where the enemy arty is located. This is not perfect of course, good arty players tend not to go where the other arty go but if you pay careful attention to what your arty are doing you will at least have some idea. When you know roughly where their arty is you will have a much better chance of putting large obstacles between you and them.  Rule #4. Kill arty.  If you have a chance to kill the enemy arty without yoloing then do it. Letting him get away is never a good thing, he can easily make you rue your mistake so if you get the chance to put a shot into him then do it. If you have more than one choice of target and arty is one of them then shoot at arty.  Rule #5. Accept your fate.  They will get you in the end, sometimes you have absolutely no choice but to make yourself a target, or perhaps they just get lucky. It's going to happen, accept that it's going to happen and try to not let it get to you when it does happen. Raging is not going to help, abusing arty is not going to help (not you anyway, arty is going to love it though), just accept it and move on to the next game."

WorldofTanks,3e03h5,rabbit994,8,Tue Jul 21 14:22:56 2015 UTC,"Remember Radio ranges are circles around the tank but if they touch, you are in radio communication. Therefore, two IS-6s need to be over 880M away from each other before they don't show up on minimap for each other and anything they are spotting isn't visible to you either. That's pretty much one side of map to another. If there is another tank over there seeing same thing IS-6 sees, lack of radio range doesn't matter at all.  My guess is it's some radio they shoved in there and no one has complained because starting at around Tier 6, radio ranges reach the point where they stop mattering for most part and by Tier 7, two tanks at opposite points can easily communicate. Hell IS top radio is 625 and it's worst at Tier 7 Heavies.   http://wiki.wargaming.net/en/Battle_Mechanics#Radio_Range"
WorldofTanks,3e03h5,Dukkerz,4,Tue Jul 21 00:16:19 2015 UTC,"Because some prems are balanced as if they were partially upgraded, so that means randomly having a tier 7 radio (or whatever the IS-6 has)."

Going from best camo in the game to no camo at all is veeery dangerous when you're bombing it around at 68km/h. It's a murderous barn of vengence.  The 30b is just a better Leo. Snipe. Don't get hit. Never take a fair fight.
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,adamdevigili,8,Mon Jul 20 14:00:57 2015 UTC,The 30b is just a better Leo   wat
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,NuclearHotdogsHD,4,Mon Jul 20 13:33:23 2015 UTC,"ikr, they are pretty much exactly the same except the leo is ever so slightly better in most aspects but the amx30 dosent get ammo racked every other shot, so that helps"
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,Thyrotoxic,3,Mon Jul 20 14:03:53 2015 UTC,The 30B has a way better gun. The dispersion values make a big difference.
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,HaroldSax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:48:02 2015 UTC,"Also it's not just ammo racks, the 30B is just a more stout tank by a very significant margin in terms of module damage.  Whoops, replied to the wrong comment. Oh well vOv"
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,justjax,-3,Mon Jul 20 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"This assertion that the Leo 1 has ammo rack problems is absurd. I have played like 800 games in mine, and its ammo rack is no more a problem than the ones in any of the other tier 10 meds. i would actually say I have a bigger problem with the STB-1s rack than the Leos."
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,arktoid,4,Tue Jul 21 00:56:29 2015 UTC,Two words: ammo rack.
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,Iohet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:12:44 2015 UTC,"Fairly well mitigated with Safe Stowage.    It IS a poor choice for a Wet Ammo Rack, though, given that you shouldn't be getting shot at and brawling with it like you might with the Type 59."
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,adamdevigili,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:12:44 2015 UTC,I have about 150 battles in my Leo 1 averaging around 3400 damage and can honestly say that the ammo rack isn't that big of a problem for me. Definitely not enough of a problem that I would but the 30B above it.
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,arktoid,2,Mon Jul 20 18:50:50 2015 UTC,"Well the ammo rack problem is pretty much non-existent if you never get hit, so I'll give you that one. The thing is, these vehicles are so incredibly similar, that the small differences between them are negligible, except for the ammo rack.   I would say it all comes down to preference."
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,adamdevigili,2,Mon Jul 20 15:22:36 2015 UTC,"But in every real way that matters on fast lightly armored vehicles like these, the Leo is better. It is noticeably faster and has a noticeably better gun."
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,Thyrotoxic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:10 2015 UTC,"Except the gun isn't better. The dispersion on the 30B is a lot better than on the Leo, it's way more responsive on the move and turning your turret."
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,KptKrondog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:44 2015 UTC,"the 30b has the same dispersion (0.3) as the leo, and the 30b has a 2.1s aim time compared to the Leo's 1.9s.  You really only gain a tiny amount of turret armor, but lose 1 degree of gun depression with the 30b."
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,meem1029,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:52:35 2015 UTC,"The fully aimed dispersion is the same, but the hidden values for it (so the amount it blooms on turret movement/tank movement/firing) are better on the 30b. Source"
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,Thyrotoxic,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:04:34 2015 UTC,The 30B has the same accuracy (0.29) but all around 0.02 better dispersion for every stat. It also has 2.0s aimtime not 2.1s (Leo has 1.8s). The dispersion makes the difference imho. It's just a nicer tank to play.
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,Siriothrax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:08:17 2015 UTC,Leo Dispersion: 0.18/0.18/0.08 (Moving/Tank/Turret) AMX Dispersion: 0.16/0.16/0.06

WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,Rhincodon-typus,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:57 2015 UTC,"The gun behaves a small bit better overall and it becomes fairly evident on snap shots.  You lose some mobility, gain a pulpit fit for the Pope, and get some very slightly better armor that will net the occasional bounce, and you don't get racked with a sideways glance in your direction which is nice."
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,Seeriath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:14 2015 UTC,The 30b gun is better.

WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,0ne_Winged_Angel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:56:01 2015 UTC,The Lorraine actually has somewhat adequate camo.   11.63 stationary for the Lorraine and 17.67 stationary for the 13 90.
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,KptKrondog,2,Mon Jul 20 13:48:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but on the move the Lorr only gets 8.72 camo value, but the 13-90 retains the full 17.67. It's twice as stealthy as the Lorraine in motion."
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,TriumphantPWN,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:39:53 2015 UTC,"The trick with the lorraine is to pretend you're in a better AMX 50 100 that's tier 9. It's fast as hell, use that to your advantage when reloading on large maps. You can go all the way around the map during a reload and come behind people. You've got lots of gun depression, so don't stick your tall tank over the hill when you only need to stick half of your turret over. It's a pure support tank, but it's pretty good at it (just like the 50 100). Let a couple main heavies take a hit, then pull up and put 3-4 shells into the bad guy before they reload.  The amx 30 proto is just a better Leo PTA. They play the same way, but you can be a little more aggressive in the amx since you don't have a 10s reload...But not too aggressive, since you're still in a french tank and you have no armor.   Go for them both, especially if you liked the 50 100 and were decent in it since that's almost exactly how you have to play the lorraine. The batchat is worth it, and the 30b looks pretty good as well if you don't already have a leo 1."
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,protXx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:01:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, how much different is the lorr from the 50 100? They use the same gun, but the lorr has a 15 second shorter reload, and seems much faster."
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,protXx,3,Mon Jul 20 19:13:39 2015 UTC,"Recently, I have been collecting unique tanks because those are have the most fun potential for me, like E 25, KV-2 and so on. The BC is a very unique machine, can carry games really hard. The AMX 30B is just like all the other Royal Ordnance tanks in the game (we have a few of those).  So: I recommend the BC over the AMX but only if you progress to tier 10, because in tier 9 AMX is better than lorri. BC is more fun to me, but to each their own I guess :)"
WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,batkhow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:38:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. I think i am destined for the BC because i only got good at this game when I got my 13 90. However, i am investigating my options."

WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,PlanetaryGenocide,2,Mon Jul 20 13:54:26 2015 UTC,"The amx 30 is better than the lorraine by a long while, also its nice to not have 40 seconds of vulnerability every so often."

WorldofTanks,3dxx9x,PlanetaryGenocide,-4,Mon Jul 20 13:14:58 2015 UTC,If you've played the Leo 1 the amx 3p is pretty much the leo at tier 9 but with shittier gun handling iirc

WorldofTanks,3e0ck7,stmk,10,Mon Jul 20 23:55:07 2015 UTC,"The 263 would be your ticket.  HOWEVER as a Foch 155 driver, I must admit that while the Foch 155 doesn't have much carry potential, it's one of my favorite tanks to drive for pure fun.  The Foch 155 is not a very good tank; there, I said it.  But if you set aside win rate for a moment and just concentrate on the pure uncensored joy of cramming three 750 damage shells up the hull of an enemy tank in 10 seconds while you laugh manically at their futile attempts to hit your weakspots or run away, you'll see what I mean.  Following said maniacal laughter, you should immediately consult Han Solo's guide to survival as published in Star Wars Episode IV from the chapter when he chases some storm troopers through the Death Star.  The Foch 155 is a bipolar player's best friend.  Real talk though, the Foch 155 is pretty mobile, has a good autoloader (that's outclassed by the waffle), has pretty good frontal armor, OK to bad camo, largeish weakspots, a narrow gun arc, bad but not unworkable gun handling, no side or rear armor, a large silhouette, and surprisingly OK money loss for a tier 10.  Another plus to the Foch 155 is the tier 9 Foch which IMO plays more like a medium than a TD.  In the end, I'd still go with the 263 over the Foch, but since the Foch is the on-track vehicle right now, it's worth considering."
WorldofTanks,3e0ck7,Dae314,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:13:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response.  I decided to buy the T9 foch on sale as well as purchase the T7 in the 263 line.

WorldofTanks,3dxs5g,KptKrondog,4,Mon Jul 20 16:13:11 2015 UTC,"The difference is that it used to be faster than/as fast as a lot of mediums, so running away wasn't an option for most tanks on the battlefield.

The weak spots frontally aren't that large, especially if you are moving/wiggling your turret. Agree with it being slower then fuck, gun is very workable in 8 and 9, and even with APCR spam you can make money. I really like mine, its more like a heavy then a medium. But once you learn it is awesome."
WorldofTanks,3dyq0e,CdnUkr,6,Mon Jul 20 17:18:01 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. With the recent armor changes, I have been trolled more than once by the armor on that thing. Shooting at the weak spots seems to be a lot less reliable than I recall it being."

It does have decent gun handling and plays like a normal american tank except that it's slow (not nearly as bad as some people say, you're never behind the fight like a TOG) and you don't have to hull down, in fact I wouldn't because the temptation to shoot you is your biggest stregth."

WorldofTanks,3dyq0e,rossmtbiker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:18 2015 UTC,"If I for whatever reason could only ever get enough gold for a super pershing in game, id scrap that idea and get a cdc. The super pershing is a slow heavy (not even a heavium) with bad standard pen and very obvious weakspots which are easily abused at close range.   It does have some redeeming factors though. If you know how to aim, ammo is cheap. It has preferential mm which means your 172 pen should be enough most of the time and youll never get that lowest teir fear you get being a teir 8 in a teir 10 match.  Would I buy it if it were on sale? Nope, probably not. It looks fairly boring to play and thats not what I want a premium tank I expect to be playing a lot. I guess like the t95 itll be fun for average to under average players mainly, but for me, id much rather the high octane action of the other mediums, even the ones without preferential mm or even better, id save up and get something like the fcm 50t.  Should you get it? That depends whether or not youre ok with fairly boring gameplay, always aiming for weakspots and knowing your angles or are mainly playing american mediums and want something to grind your crew out in."

WorldofTanks,3dw319,_taugrim_,10,Mon Jul 20 00:40:16 2015 UTC,"I review the AMX 13 90, a tier 8 French light tank, with a replay of a tier 9 Fiery Salient (Prokhorovka) battle.  Stat line: Ace Tanker, 3.2k damage, 2.9k assisted damage, 8 spots, 2 kills  I discuss how to complete LT-15, the light tank mission that requires 4k+ damage contribution, which is the sum of direct damage and assisted damage.  IMO the most consistent way to reach 4k+ is spotting from hill, because unlike passive scouting on the 1/2 lines, you can fire on tanks and then retreat behind hard cover.  Strengths and Weaknesses   excellent camouflage excellent gold round (ACPR with 248 pen) good view range (400m) good burst damage (1440) in a full clip poor accuracy (0.38) poor gun handling on-the-move long clip reload (38 seconds with Vents) poor gun depression and rear mounted turret limit hill-fighting capability small crew (3) hampers skill acquisition   Comments / Errata:   it's important to stay out of the line of fire when enemy tanks are shooting at your friendlies. E.g. at 3:49, the enemy T-54's shell passes within a few meters of my hull, so I move up the hill a bit and point my hull towards the T-54 to make my profile smaller. By the same token, I stay away from the friendly AMX 50 100, who repeatedly exposes himself to spotting and enemy fire   This video is part of my ""Road to Unicum"" series in which I share what I learned as I progressed towards account Unicum rating (top 1%) with silver ammo only.

WorldofTanks,3dw319,JSMorin,2,Mon Jul 20 11:25:05 2015 UTC,"Not really.  I'm making videos of tanks I'm playing, and right now that's French lights.  When I first started the series I had a lot of replays that I could use, but I've covered a fair number different tank classes and trees."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Roidhogan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:18:23 2015 UTC,"IMO the most consistent way to reach 4k+ is spotting from hill, because unlike passive scouting on the 1/2 lines, you can fire on tanks and then retreat behind hard cover.   The things I don't like about hill spotting is the prevalence of tanks on your own team to poach your spotting damage, and the yolo factor. Your own video shows the dangers of that. If that had been a T-54 instead of a 13 90, you could have been in trouble.  The 1/2 line is a gold mine if you have friendly artillery. The two dangers are similar to the hill, but slightly different. You have to worry about yolo tanks getting to you before TDs and arty can destroy them, and friendly scouts might steal some of your middle-range spotting damage. You also lose the comforts of hard cover.  By the same token, the bush cover is much more usable. Once you've established control over the middle ridge and stopped their active scouts from surfing, you can spot, pull back, and take shots of your own."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Aenimopiate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:08:26 2015 UTC,"If that had been a T-54 instead of a 13 90, you could have been in trouble   If that had been a T-54, I would have already spotted him previously, and my team would have been firing at him.  Therefore, not a fair comparison.   The 1/2 line is a gold mine if you have friendly artillery...You have to worry about yolo tanks getting to you   Agree on both points.  I find that with hill I control my own destiny moreso than the 1/2 line scouting."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Justanaussie,6,Mon Jul 20 19:43:29 2015 UTC,"Trollbegone!   upvote it with bots   I actually never vote on my own videos.  The vast majority of YouTubers probably give themselves a thumbs up on their videos, but I don't want to taint the voting data."

WorldofTanks,3dw319,avalon304,2,Mon Jul 20 06:25:04 2015 UTC,Great stuff!
WorldofTanks,3dw319,avalon304,2,Mon Jul 20 06:34:54 2015 UTC,"I'm really enjoying light tanks at the moment (after I hated the ELC) so I'm familiar with that bush in the west. Just this morning I parked my T37 there and got 5.5k spotting damage (and of course I didn't have LT15 turned on) but that was against a team that wasn't highly skilled and I had a lot of backup. However if I spawn south in a light tank that's reasonably quick (Bulldog, 59-16 etc) the first thing I'll do is rush to that point to spot the inevitable enemy light tanks going for that bush. Works an amazing amount of the time.  Overall though with Prokhorovka I'll surf the ridge line a fair bit, unless it's obvious I have no backup and the enemy is getting a little rambunctious in the middle. Your choice of bush on the hill for passive scouting was interesting but wouldn't you run the risk of being an accidental meat shield for any of your heavies that are poking over the lip of the hill and being shot at by enemy tanks in the middle of the map?"
WorldofTanks,3dw319,backjacker,2,Mon Jul 20 01:56:49 2015 UTC,"I parked my T37 there and got 5.5k spotting damage (and of course I didn't have LT15 turned on) but that was against a team that wasn't highly skilled and I had a lot of backup   It can work out great, but I find that passive scouting from there is too dependent on the team. Whereas by spotting from hill, I ""create my own luck"".   wouldn't you run the risk of being an accidental meat shield for any of your heavies that are poking over the lip of the hill and being shot at by enemy tanks in the middle of the map?   Yes.  This is why I wrote this in the description of the video. I meant to talk about it, but forgot to:   it's important to stay out of the line of fire when enemy tanks are shooting at your friendlies. E.g. at 3:49, the enemy T-54's shell passes within a few meters of my hull, so I move up the hill a bit and point my hull towards the T-54 to make my profile smaller. By the same token, I stay away from the friendly AMX 50 100, who repeatedly exposes himself to spotting and enemy fire"
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Raykahn,2,Mon Jul 20 03:39:51 2015 UTC,This is why I wrote this in the description of the video.   And this is why I should learn how to read. D'oh.
WorldofTanks,3dw319,avalon304,2,Mon Jul 20 05:01:07 2015 UTC,"Well, it is my fault for not speaking to this in the video.  It's a subtle point but very important.  EDIT: added annotations to the video, to make this point more visible. Thanks for motivating me to add them :)"
WorldofTanks,3dw319,avalon304,2,Mon Jul 20 05:50:49 2015 UTC,"wouldn't you run the risk of being an accidental meat shield for any of your heavies that are poking over the lip of the hill and being shot at by enemy tanks in the middle of the map   The first point is minor. You're small, so getting hit by accident can happen, but not often. The bigger issue is when one of their tanks pushes up and lights you. You often die before you have a chance to pull back.  The second point is one of the reasons I don't like the spot. Sure, you can retreat down the hill a bit to stay out of trouble up top, but that crossfire from the middle can be brutal if your team isn't supporting by keeping them lit. Plus, you can get roughed up by your own teammates when there's a crowded slope. Backing up full speed into an E75 who turns unexpectedly can ruin your game."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,avalon304,2,Mon Jul 20 06:37:47 2015 UTC,"How much of what will be seen in these videos will work in other light tanks? I have none of the french ones, but I do have a T71, Bulldog and Type 62. Will the things seenc in the videos on the french lights help me too? Ive never been a big fan of lights but want to get better."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,avalon304,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:12:50 2015 UTC,"How much of what will be seen in these videos will work in other light tanks?    The spotting techniques apply to all light tanks.  You do want to be careful, like at 4:13 where I was passively spotting the IS-3 and not even fully behind a bush, because with a tank with lesser camo, you might get spotted. All I needed to do was drive a few feet to get fully behind the bush, but I stayed there partly for illustrative purposes."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Raykahn,2,Mon Jul 20 06:12:15 2015 UTC,Thanks... I will be sure to pay attention to the spotting techniques and positioning.
WorldofTanks,3dw319,avalon304,2,Mon Jul 20 06:34:40 2015 UTC,"I managed to finish off the Stug IV light tank missions today in my T37 (no honors so I have to do it again, fuck me).   Surprisingly on Live Oaks, I did fail-toon with an M40/43 and got into a tier 10 match, made it out with no direct damage done but 5k spotting. Got nuked by a JPE-100, but oh well.  So that was nice.  Replay for those interested  It's a pretty obvious spotting location, honestly."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,avalon304,2,Mon Jul 20 07:36:05 2015 UTC,"Hey Taugrim, another great video.  Question for you; what are you using to edit these videos?  And what settings do you use when rendering?  I like to play with making videos a bit myself, and when I render them and play the video file on my computer they look great, very clear and crisp.  However, when I upload them to youtube and they go through whatever compression is done on there, I see quite a few compression artifacts.  Your videos seem to handle it much better, which is why I ask.  Thanks!"
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Raykahn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:45:46 2015 UTC,"what are you using to edit these videos? And what settings do you use when rendering?   I use FRAPS to record the replays. You can use OBS which is free.  For editing, I use Adobe Premier Elements.  I render at 1080p 30fps in MP4 format.  You can read more about here: http://taugrim.com/pc-setup/   However, when I upload them to youtube and they go through whatever compression is done on there, I see quite a few compression artifacts   Yes, there is some quality loss as YouTube converts videos into a format for storage on their cloud. The best thing you can do is create the highest-quality video you can. I also record the footage with replays using the max graphics settings - that helps."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,avalon304,2,Mon Jul 20 09:02:30 2015 UTC,You have a 970M in your laptop... you could probably use Nvidia's ShadowPlay to record if you decided you wanted to move away from FRAPS. Ive had pretty good experiences using it.
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Raykahn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:23:05 2015 UTC,"ShadowPlay to record if you decided you wanted to move away from FRAPS. Ive had pretty good experiences using it   I haven't played around with it much yet.  FRAPS creates ginormous files, but I was under the impression the quality at max settings was better than Shadowplay.  Do you happen to know?"
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Raykahn,2,Mon Jul 20 18:08:57 2015 UTC,"I dont know how big your normal files get, but when I record, I record at 1080p, 60FPS, 50Mbps, with H.264 (so it record straight to MP4) and a 14 minute video is just a bit under 5GB and shadowplay tells me a 15 minute file (the maximum size of my Shadow buffer) will be 5.6GB.  As far as quality...  its been a long time since I used FRAPS, so I cant really speak to it (and posting a YouTube video would be rather inconclusive, given that we likely use different settings in editing and YouTube generally murders videos)."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,avalon304,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.   14 minute video is just a bit under 5GB and shadowplay tells me a 15 minute file (the maximum size of my Shadow buffer) will be 5.6GB.   A battle in FRAPS that lasts 10 minutes will generate create about eight 4-GB files (32GB total).  When I edit that in APE to a 10-min video in MP4 format (1080p, 30 fps) it's generally about 2GB is size."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Raykahn,2,Mon Jul 20 19:02:44 2015 UTC,MB? That seems abnormally small for any recorded video... I installed FRAPS (the free version) and a 30 second file was something like 2GB... where as a 30 second file from ShadowPlay was 30MB...  Edited videos that are 15minutes long for me from Premier CC wind up being just under  1GB most times...
WorldofTanks,3dw319,avalon304,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:33:04 2015 UTC,"Oops, GB for everything. Fixed in my post."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Raykahn,2,Mon Jul 20 23:37:18 2015 UTC,"Thats what I thought... but I had to be sure... you might have found an awesome new way to record.  Either way, you may want to give Shadowplay a look, it'll give you smaller files sizes, less overall files and possibly better quality.  Here is a direct upload of a file I captured with ShadowPlay, using the above settings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KLxsNim7X0 (though as I said, Youtube generally murders videos, so its not a direct representation, but it was a direct unedited upload)"
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Cpt_Fubar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:18:03 2015 UTC,"Either way, you may want to give Shadowplay a look, it'll give you smaller files sizes, less overall files and possibly better quality.   I tested this evening.  Shadowplay MP4 files are smaller.  I did notice a slight quality difference in the AVI files from FRAPS, when comparing certain visual elements such as the row of tank icons across the top of the screen.  Then again, with the YouTube encoding, it may not really matter."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,similar_observation,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:28:06 2015 UTC,"No, /u/taugrim won't be able to do that, unfortunately.  I have a 980m and can't use shadowplay to record WoT.  Mobile versions of the driver you cannot enable 'capture desktop' which is required to record WoT with shadowplay (at least until they implement directx support).  The reason for that is mobile computers generally use the onboard gpu for the desktop, and not the dedicated gpu, which makes capturing the desktop via shadowplay impossible."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Cpt_Fubar,2,Tue Jul 21 06:12:30 2015 UTC,The only time you need to enable 'Capture Desktop' to record something with ShadowPlay is if you play a game in windowed mode.
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Exoooo,2,Tue Jul 21 05:38:29 2015 UTC,"Mobile versions of the driver you cannot enable 'capture desktop' which is required to record WoT with shadowplay (at least until they implement directx support).   I had no issues using the manual record feature of Shadowplay with WoT on my GTX 970m card, and yours is the higher card."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Exoooo,3,Tue Jul 21 05:46:43 2015 UTC,"He probably plays in windowed, fullscreen rather than just plain fullscreen. If you play in a window, you need to be able to capture the desktop, as the application doesnt have full control over the display."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Exoooo,2,Tue Jul 21 06:13:22 2015 UTC,"No, I have always played in fullscreen.  Yours and Taugrim's comment did make me look at my stuff, and let nvidia experience update itself and now it does seem to be working.  That makes me very happy, haha.  It is a much better recording solution than fraps, so thank you."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Exoooo,3,Tue Jul 21 06:18:24 2015 UTC,Glad its now working for you! :D
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Trenticle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:34:23 2015 UTC,now it does seem to be working   Nice!
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Trenticle,2,Tue Jul 21 07:39:34 2015 UTC,"I also record with fraps, and am using Sony Vegas Pro for the editing.  Do you record with 30fps or higher?  Rendering seems about the same.  1080p 30fps to mp4.  I suspect it has to do with the average bit rate you render with compared to what I do.  Right now I let it average at 12mbps and peak as high as 24mbps.  Judging by the size of 2gb you suggested for a 10 minute video you are allowing almost twice what I do.  So probably ~24mbps average for your videos? A 7 minute video for me comes out to about 800mb, so clearly my compression is a bit higher and it is not playing nice with youtube.  I will try cranking up the bit rate in a short video to check it out."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Trenticle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:40 2015 UTC,"am using Sony Vegas Pro for the editing. Do you record with 30fps or higher?   30, but only because Adobe Premier Elements 10 doesn't support an HD format in 1080p with a higher framerate than 30.   So probably ~24mbps average for your videos?   I use MP4-H264 1080p 30fps (29.97).  Here are the output characteristics: VBR, 1 Pass, Target 32 Mbps, Max 40 Mbps"
WorldofTanks,3dw319,GrassWaterDirtHorse,2,Tue Jul 21 05:54:06 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I don't seem to have an option for mp4 h264, the recommended on vegas is AAC.  I will have to dig through all the options and see if I can't find it.    I ran a short clip through with varying bitrates to see how they would do.  The difference between 12 and 50 is very noticeable in the rendered video before upload, the difference between 50 and 240 is less noticeable but still there.  There is not much difference between any of them once they get on youtube, though.  Its compression just murders it so much =(  This clip is great for showing it, too.  Lots of different colors and quite a bit of motion.    12mbs    50mbs    240mbps  Anyways, thanks for the info you gave me.  If I come across some magical rendering setting that is brilliant for youtube I will let you know haha."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Trenticle,2,Tue Jul 21 06:17:01 2015 UTC,"Jesus... Youtube really does just murder video... although, for whatever reason, your 50Mbps clip still looks substantially worse than mine do... at least to my eye..."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Helheimr_237,2,Tue Jul 21 08:12:51 2015 UTC,"Yea, its very noticeable to me, which is why I asked.    The only thing left for me to play with will be codecs.  There is a good chance the one I am using just disagrees with youtube, which is unfortunate because everything I can find recommends it as the best option for sony vegas.  And also to be fair I chose that clip specifically because all the motion and terrain colors are the perfect breeding ground for compression artifacts.  EDIT:  Just to show.  This is how the 50mbs video looks after being rendered on my computer. This is how it looks after uploading to youtube.    Drives me nuts."
WorldofTanks,3dw319,Exoooo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:34:36 2015 UTC,Looks like either MainConcept AVC or Sony AVC are H.264-MP4 in Sony Vegas.

WorldofTanks,3dz9eu,1H4v3Numb3r51nMyN4m3,3,Mon Jul 20 19:14:50 2015 UTC,"It varies on the issue. Some teams are bigger than others.  Also depends on year time. For instance, I imagine right now (summer holidays) and other similar holidays they get exponentially more tickets than usual.  For instance to change my email in March it took just 1 day (not even in reality). To change my cellphone number last week it took ~8d of various posts back and forth - generally 1~3 days between posts including some delay from mine.  I remember being banned for ""advertising gold websites"" because I reported a spammer bot to a mod and I guess he was annoyed. The ticket explaining the situation only took like 5hrs to be answered positively and the situation reversed.  Generally speaking NA customer support is pretty decent but I imagine they get swamped pretty hard atm."

WorldofTanks,3dz9eu,Lemmiatem,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:52:12 2015 UTC,"It usually doesn't take that long, but that is largely because they have some bot issuing canned responses that answer questions you didn't ask in the first place. Long story short: Wargaming customer service is awful and if  you have to submit a ticket, the answer is already no."

WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,exodus300,3,Mon Jul 20 17:19:39 2015 UTC,Between the RU 251 and the KV-4 - which one do you enjoy playing more?   You should probably work that line.
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,johnbr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:24:13 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, I live both. I enjoyed the crap out of the 416 so I love sniper tanks, but at the same time, I love hearing the pings off of my tank :D"
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,Dae314,7,Mon Jul 20 17:25:54 2015 UTC,So why not grind both?  What else are you doing once your KV-4 is sent back to the garage that prevents you from jumping right into your RU 251 (or visa-versa).
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,Dae314,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:36:40 2015 UTC,"Eventually I will grind both, I'd just rather get the consensus ""better one"" for Strongholds first. Also, which has a better Tier 9 because that could help the grind."
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,meem1029,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't have either tank and I don't play Strongholds so I can't tell you which one is better for that purpose.  For tier 9...  From reading reviews and playing against them, the ST-I is an armored beast.  I've seen lots of people claim that the ST-I is one of the best tier 9 heavies, and I believe them.  I'm sure you noticed that the stock gun on it is rather terrible though.  Hopefully you have a plan for that.  The PTA doesn't get as good reviews from people.  It's definitely a more flexible tank though so you'll be able to play it more creatively.  Seeing as nothing carries over from the Indien, I'm betting that its stock grind will be worse than the ST-I.  Since you're looking to strongholds, I'd maybe discuss with your commander what type of tank would be more useful for your clan."
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,meem1029,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:26:55 2015 UTC,I actually went to the Leo via the RU-251 so I believe the engine carries over (although I may be wrong). Either way thank you for the comprehensive advice!
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,EnvyMyPancakes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:24 2015 UTC,"Well, neither of them are really used in Strongholds. The ST-I is definitely the better tier 9 of them.   I would recommend doing as others have said and buy back the 416 to get the T-54 and the other (better) russian mediums."
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,Spazzatree,2,Mon Jul 20 19:11:32 2015 UTC,"Kept the 416 as it is godly, have already unlocked the T-54. I guess my question then is are the T62/140 really that much better than the 430 to justify grinding them out?"
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,Kennung,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:40:18 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in clan wars yes. I've not gotten to the 430 yet (still on v2) but I have heard the differences are enough to matter. Also the t-54 is a lot of fun. I ended up unlocking the 140 hardly realizing it because I just played what I liked which was often the 54.   When it comes down to it, there's a fairly limited pool of Tanks used regularly in cw/strongholds unless you're a small clan that is very limited in what you can get. You are only close to the 140 by the sound of it."
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,NuclearHotdogsHD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:45:50 2015 UTC,Did this yesterday afternoon...Sp 1C + 7-8 hours = 50k xp without even realizing
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,bbluech,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:51:11 2015 UTC,"Yes imho the 140 is the best of all three, although getting the T62 A helps with clan wars tank locking, as they are both similar in play style."
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,defeatedbird,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:36 2015 UTC,"I have heard that about the 140, I'll probably aim for the Russian Trifecta!"
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,bbluech,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:43:40 2015 UTC,"Both are tanks that are not used in CW, so the question is either to start a useful line, like T62a/140, etc, or to finish a useless line."
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,That_Unknown_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:11 2015 UTC,Not really an option.  Edit: Obviously I've changed my mind in this so thanks!
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,That_Unknown_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:02 2015 UTC,Why not? Your already at t8 on both the 140 and 62a lines?
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,theDumb12,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:11:04 2015 UTC,IS4 is a good all rounder decent heavy with good HP decent Armour and a good but low alpha gun. Leo is IMO the more fun tank but also much more difficult. The grind for the t-9's though is really easy for the IS4 with the ST-I being a beast. The PTA is ok but terrible stock and really hard to play.
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,Noob_Rising,2,Mon Jul 20 18:44:20 2015 UTC,"low alpha gun   Well, it's got 10% more alpha than half the heavies in the game.  400 alpha - 215b, E5, 50B.  more than 440 alpha - E100, Maus, IS-7.  I don't count the 113 but IIRC that has 440 alpha too, putting the IS-4 dead in the middle."
WorldofTanks,3dyu0p,defeatedbird,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:57 2015 UTC,I would consider the 215b e5 50b to all have low alpha as well. Technically yes it does have more alpha than quite a few HT's but it is still only a little over half the e100's alpha. So in terms of gameplay that makes a much bigger difference than the 40hp difference from the 215b ect.

WorldofTanks,3duga9,etienne_valejo,11,Sun Jul 19 16:17:11 2015 UTC,"Wings received a bit of attention on Reddit last week. One thing people were amazed at were the tanks, and a few questioned whether those were real or models.  While they certainly are real and appear to be Renault FTs, I think they are actually the US-licensed copy of the FT: the M1917. It turns out this film was produced in the US, and was filmed in Texas. Furthermore, the U.S. Army apparently contributed a good amount of military hardware and soldiers as extras. If you look at the footage of the tanks again, you'll notice that the turret is polygonal (all M1917s had polygonal turrets, some FTs did, too). Also, note the mantlet plate with the rounded bottom, which is unique to M1917s armed with the 37mm."
WorldofTanks,3duga9,Watchung,5,Sun Jul 19 18:09:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, the French tier 1... and the Chinese. And the Soviet. And the Japanese."

WorldofTanks,3duga9,Tsundere_Tanker,2,Sun Jul 19 22:58:36 2015 UTC,Yes... do a quick search on the T-18 Light Tank.
WorldofTanks,3duga9,vidkunquislingII,2,Mon Jul 20 03:14:56 2015 UTC,It was based on a Renault. Is the Ram II an M3 Lee because it was based on a Lee?
WorldofTanks,3duga9,Tsundere_Tanker,3,Mon Jul 20 04:06:59 2015 UTC,"The T-18 was literally a reverse engineered Reno with different suspension. The Ram is a different product from the Lee made from different blueprints from the get-go and was actually designed ahead of time.  In the case the FT-17 and the T-18 it's what happened when the Russians didn't have the blueprints but had fourteen partial FT-17's to tear apart and imitate. It's literally a failed FT-17 clone, but in the end it's still more FT-17 than its own creation. A Ram is a totally different product than a Lee. Different blueprints but a shared chassis and drivetrain because of simple exchangeable parts and the wonders of mass production."
WorldofTanks,3duga9,Watchung,3,Mon Jul 20 04:32:39 2015 UTC,"I'd say the MS-1 is close enough in design and history to qualify as a modified FT-17. A strongly modified one perhaps, but still an FT-17 at heart, just like the American M1917."

WorldofTanks,3dwf26,iYokay,-2,Mon Jul 20 08:09:10 2015 UTC,My fun in the game is progressing through tank lines and improving.
WorldofTanks,3dwf26,Exoooo,6,Mon Jul 20 08:33:22 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that you're not the only person who plays World of Tanks, everybody enjoys the game in different ways.  I also have fun by progressing through tank lines and such, but that was not what you said.  You progress through tank lines while playing artillery, so that's one of your boxes ticked, and you can also see yourself improve while playing artillery, learning lead times, when and when not to shoot, etc., it's only RNG reliant up to a point.  You have fun how you have fun, just don't tell other people how they should be playing the game just because you dislike something, it seems like you're simply speaking out of your rage of getting killed or damaged by arty in the past.  Edit: Words"
WorldofTanks,3dwf26,iYokay,-4,Mon Jul 20 08:44:03 2015 UTC,"If he wants to get better, arty will do next to nothing to help. It's the most RNG-reliant type in the game."
WorldofTanks,3dwf26,backjacker,4,Mon Jul 20 07:31:04 2015 UTC,"I should probably also add that your argument of ""If he wants to get better, arty will do next to nothing to help.""  Yes it will.  It will help you get better at playing arty, and if arty ends up being one of his main lines, that will mean he is getting better at the game he likes to play.  It's the same way with lights, playing lights helps you get better at lights, playing heavies will make you become better at playing heavies, etc.  You can't expect to play 1000 battles in only lights and immediately be able to perform just as well in every other class.  Every type of tank you play will help you get better at that tank type, so even if you are playing arty, you're still improving at a particular class just as you would playing any other tank class.  Now you could say ""Well, playing a light or TD isn't much different than playing a heavy, whereas arty varies widely."" - but the thing is, they generally do very a lot from each other, admittedly not as much as arty.  When you're playing a heavy, you're brawling in CQC in a city, in a TD you're sitting back and sniping, in a light you're using terrain and ridges to assist in spotting the enemy and letting your team do the damage. (These generalizations based of course on your stereotypical tank destroyer, and not strange editions such as the ELC in the light tank line, or the T49.  Playing arty helps with more than just arty, it helps learn the movements and main routes of the maps, as well as the armor and health values of certain tanks.  I have a mod installed that tells me the armor thickness of my targets, which I try to memorize, so whenever I aim at someone, I can see their tank stats and learn them for when I'm playing my other tanks.  So in the end, you are getting better at something just the same as you would be playing any other class.  Holy wall of text"
WorldofTanks,3dwf26,iYokay,-2,Mon Jul 20 08:53:03 2015 UTC,"Okay.  Arty is the most RNG-reliant class in the game - this is important because it means that your performance is largely reliant on luck. Your ""fun"" is almost ENTIRELY DEPENDENT on luck. There really isn't too much to improve on when your performance is entirely based on RNG. Yes, you can learn where to get angles and such. But if RNG doesn't like you, you're not going to have a good game regardless. Playing arty is pointless, unless you like being frustrated. I honestly don't get how people think throwing their wins/performance to the wind and hoping for the best is fun. Why not just take an active role and try your hardest and actually have an impact on the match?  Did I also mention that if you don't have a good crew, arty is completely shit to play?  You learn the map and movements of tanks - so... why not just play actual tanks and do that exact same thing? The things you mentioned that you said you will learn via playing arty, you can do exactly that by playing actual tanks, except that you're not relying on luck, you're relying on your own skill and wit.  Two of the most critical aspects of this game are the art of not getting shot and map awareness. You can't learn those two things by playing arty.   Seriously. If I dumb this down, I'm saying that there's a lot more than just pointing and clicking in other tank types. You have to constantly look at your map, look around you, and reposition. In arty, you can, 75% of the time, literally get away with just pointing and clicking.   IT DOES NOTHING TO HELP A PLAYER IMPROVE HIS GAME."
WorldofTanks,3dwf26,backjacker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:57 2015 UTC,"Are you saying all of this in hopes of ruining my fun playing arty?  You can say all you want about it ""being entirely dependent on luck"" or it not doing anything to improve skill, but you act like I'm suddenly going to say ""Oh, he's right, guess I'll sell all of my arty.""  Say all you want, if someone plays arty they're used to getting harassed constantly, and if they stick through that, they'll stick through someone like you trying to convince me not to play it."
WorldofTanks,3dwf26,iYokay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:19:16 2015 UTC,"I'm saying it because your point was that there are things to learn for OP by playing arty. I don't care about your experience in arty, I'm trying to give advice to OP, when others are telling him arty is a worthwhile experience. You've given yours, I'm giving mine in opposition to yours. You've got a problem with that?  You can keep wasting time by playing arty, but I'm going to speak out against you when you start recommending arty to other players, whether they end up liking it or not."
WorldofTanks,3dwf26,backjacker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:29:05 2015 UTC,"Why not let him try it on his own?  He can make decisions for himself, you know.  Let him try it instead of giving him biased summaries of what playing it is like."

So you're allowed to give him your opinion of ""arty will help you learn things in the game"" (which is also subjective) but I can't say ""arty is not worth your time"" (equally subjective).   He probably WILL try it for himself. I hope he DOES. That way he can think for himself and come to a conclusion, whether it's liking or not liking arty.  My point is that I'm giving my opinion on the subject, because you did. Never did I say ""DON'T PLAY ARTY"" I merely told him what I thought about what you guys were telling him regards to learning when playing arty."

WorldofTanks,3dwf26,backjacker,3,Mon Jul 20 17:25:02 2015 UTC,"By learning about terrible aim bloom, the reload times that take forever, and the lines of fire which don't actually span the entire map"
WorldofTanks,3dwf26,boucem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:13:48 2015 UTC,"Yes and while you're taking all that into account, you'll still be able to go to all the positions that allow you to do damage and contribute. /s  If you're not in an arty safe position (behind hard cover, etc) you're eventually going to get artied. That doesn't mean a direct hit. I mean including splash. And at higher tiers, splash damage is still very crippling, not to mention has a very large area of effect.  Take Prokhorovka. You could be in a light tank surfing the middle, but if you get unlucky that one time arty fires at you, it doesn't matter whether you're zigzagging, moving at full speed, you're going to get hit by arty or the splash.  What breaks arty is not the fact that it takes forever to reload, that it can't shoot behind cover, etc. It's the fact that it's sooooooooo reliant on luck and it has the potential to just obliterate someone in one shot. You could be doing everything right and still get hit and taken out simply because you got unlucky. That's not balanced, and no amount of ""thinking like arty"" will help him."
WorldofTanks,3dwf26,backjacker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:08 2015 UTC,"I don't ever recall a time where I've completely been put out of the game while doing everything right because of artillery.  When I get killed by arty I can almost always blame myself for it, whether it be ""I sat still too long,"" or ""I shouldn't have been in a big group as a fragile tank.""  Just about every single game has something that can happen that is very rare, but if it does you're out of the game quickly."
WorldofTanks,3dwf26,iYokay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:01:05 2015 UTC,"When I play arty and when most others play arty, they aim at the most populated areas of the map, generally where all the heavies go.  If you play arty you know not to get spotted in one of these spots when you're alone, and to certainly not sit still.  Even moving back and forth a little makes you much harder to hit, and do it unpredictably.  Maybe move forward a little bit more, then only a little back, etc.  It really isn't hard to avoid if you know how arty normally plays."
WorldofTanks,3dwf26,iYokay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:22:22 2015 UTC,"Except for the fact that luck trumps all those factors. The only surefire way to avoid arty is to sit behind hard cover.

If the E100 wasn't so damn expensive to run I'd play it all the time. Tiers 8 and 9 aren't too terrible either, only time being tier 8 sucks is in tier 10 games, then it can be awful though.

From a educational viewpoint imo the best WOT youtuber/streamer ive seen so far.  Also relevant Wotlabs article that helped me out quite a bit regarding scouting (4 of my 5 best tanks statwise are scouts :).
WorldofTanks,3dvo11,terrytoy,3,Sun Jul 19 22:52:05 2015 UTC,"""4 of my 5 best tanks statwise are scouts"" Do you mean by wn8? If so, wn8 is not even close to the real performance when talking about light tanks. Light tanks are so easy to pad damage in, which is not equivalent to skill, in most cases."
WorldofTanks,3dvo11,h3xi_,4,Mon Jul 20 04:10:28 2015 UTC,on top of that you get no WN8 value for your assistance in spotting and what not...so scouts who scout rather than pad damage should be even higher. WN8 just doesn't properly account for scouts.
WorldofTanks,3dvo11,xfatdannx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:02:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, exactly."
WorldofTanks,3dvo11,h3xi_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:17:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! Sorry to probe, but since you seem good at scouting, I'd like to ask just a few questions 1. Does a tank being stock affect camo values? 2. What aspect of scouting do you find yourself abusing most? Do you passive scout more on certain maps? What manner of active scouting is best to use? Just go side to side and hope not to get hit? 3. How do you handle not having 6th sense on your tanks? Just more defensive play?   Thanks a ton again!"
WorldofTanks,3dvo11,terrytoy,4,Sun Jul 19 23:33:59 2015 UTC,"While i am somewhat decent with scouts there are tons of people, especially around here that are miles ahead of me, so take what i say with a grain of salt.   €: smaller caliber guns reduce camo less when fired as /u/AntiZig pointed out, otherwise nope. Heavily map and matchup dependend imo. When i find myself rock bottom and the map allows me to passive scout ill go for that, if not ill go for some early lights and then play the waiting game. If you happen to be toptier you should try to be active and keep your gun in the battle tho (also dont be stingy when firing gold). In regards to active scouting minimize your exposure and never pop up in the same place twice in a row. Always keep in mind that you are fucking fast and use that, preferably to get out of danger and not into it. Stay alive and conserve your HP as good as you possibly can. Being able to actually eat one more shot later can be game deciding. Kinda hard to answer, the only light i drove without 6th was the Type 64 (which i only used in pubs to grind up sixth for stronghold use aswell :3). I had girls for the frenchies and surplus T67 crews for the americans. Frankly  scouting without sixth (or camo skill, arguably just as important) is a fucking pain in the ass. Lights are probably the most reliant tank class in the game when it comes to having decent crews (keeping camo while moving FTW) and it shows. My best bet was to be ULTRA conservative early on. Staying in seconds range of hardcover, be it a rock, slope or your teams heavy, is also strongly advised."
WorldofTanks,3dvo11,AntiZig,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:02:53 2015 UTC,"Nope    mounted gun affects your camo when firing. smaller caliber guns are harder to spot. generally, doesn't make much difference, but you're not entirely correct in your statement."

WorldofTanks,3dsdwk,Ukiah,8,Sun Jul 19 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"i would prefer to wait 1 more minute to find a game, properly balanced, rather having 10 games in a row unbalanced.."
WorldofTanks,3dsdwk,SirFlipper,3,Sun Jul 19 01:06:01 2015 UTC,"Additional waiting time is only one of the arguments against implementing a skill based matchmaking system, but just for the sake of the argument, how much longer would you be fine with waiting? DotA2 has an MMR based matchmaking system and it regularly takes around 5 minutes to find a game, with some MMR regions waiting up to 10 minutes. Mind you, that is 5 minutes waiting time per 45-60 minute match. In WoT we are talking about a waiting time per 5-10 minute match.  At this point any speculation about how much additional waiting time such a system would add is mainly guessing. I am just saying that ""I am fine with waiting longer for more balanced games"" totally depends on that additional waiting time. Imagine waiting 10 minutes for a 4 minute stomp in WoT, that would be extremely annoying."

WorldofTanks,3dsdwk,SirFlipper,2,Sun Jul 19 03:33:02 2015 UTC,"""Balanced MM"" means to me that the winchance for any given game is about 50:50 (+- a couple percent), which means the teams are evenly matched skillwise which is a skill based MM. What is ""Balanced MM"" for you then if I may ask?"
WorldofTanks,3dsdwk,reductase,4,Sun Jul 19 03:38:32 2015 UTC,"I'd be fine if MM picked 30 players at random and then tried its best balancing both teams by personal rating or some other stat the WG already has (not WN8 or another external stats).  In practice, this wouldn't be ""skill-based"", but a little more ""balanced"" than the current never ending roflstomps."
WorldofTanks,3dsdwk,SirFlipper,-1,Sun Jul 19 04:01:06 2015 UTC,"That is still ""skill based"" because the system uses a measure of skill (Personal Rating) to try and find a balanced team setup. You can argue about how appropriate PR is for this, but in the end the system is still trying to get the game to be a 50:50 split.  What you seem to be understanding as ""skill-based"" is what I would call a ""working skill-based matchmaker"", a system that is able to perfectly create matches that are 50:50 everytime (which isn't really feasible in practice I think)."
WorldofTanks,3dsdwk,Ukiah,4,Sun Jul 19 04:24:06 2015 UTC,"Skill-based MM means people of low skill only play with people of low skill, people with high skill only play with people of high skill, etc. Balanced MM just means that the number of tomatoes, greens, purples, etc are balanced among the two teams. There is a huge difference between the two. You could still have a spread from 100 WN8 to 2400 WN8 with balanced MM, but not with skill-based MM. Skill-based MM would take much longer to form matches for high skilled players because you'd have to fill an entire match with blues/purples."
WorldofTanks,3dsdwk,5larm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:20:22 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I was using both ""skill-based MM"" and ""balanced MM"" interchangeably to describe any system aiming to make the win percentages of both teams 50%, with the methodology (metric of skill, approach to balancing) as classification within the class. For what its worth, my post above (which Ukiah replies to) was written with the sentiment of ""skill-based MM"" meaning ""balanced MM"".  There is a discussion to be had about terminology, but I don't think this is the place for that."
WorldofTanks,3dsdwk,Sutex,2,Sun Jul 19 05:35:13 2015 UTC,"When you say 'skill based MM', what I think is DOTA, LoL style 'you play against people in your general skill range. If you're a tomato, you're going to only fight tomatoes and maybe orange players. If you're a teal or blue-nicum, you're only going to see other unicums.  Sort of similar to how WG is handling the weekly skirmish matchups. The first night is random. However, your record on the first night determines who you're seeded against on the second night. You're matched up against teams with similar records.  What I would like to see is less 'I'm the only NON-tomato on my team while the other team has ONE tomato, one orange, 2 yellows, 5 greens, 3 blues and a unicum platoon. It is my understanding from watching players like Bluestealth, Sela, etc. they don't like being on EITHER side of blowout matches. The unicums hate not getting enough damage in. Us mere mortals hate just being BLOWN THE FUCK OUT by an all-pro team.  edit: I want to see less of THIS -> http://i.imgur.com/wv5O7QY.jpg"

The assumption hereby is that the people playing on those weekends are on average worse than on a given non-event day during the week. I do not have any numbers to back this up, but it does make some sense: The casual (as in ""occasional"") WoT player is more likely to play on such a special day than on any other random day and he is probably worse than a dedicated player that is playing a couple of days a week. This means that the average player skill in your games drops, increasing the impact you can have and thereby increasing your chance to win.  That's my theory anyways. I probably forgot to consider something and it therefore makes no sense, so feel free to argue against it. I usually have good sessions during those weekends, but I would also describe myself as ""good enough to outplay tomatoes, gets shit on by good players"" so I guess doing well when there are a lot of tomatoes around is to be expected."

You can get to t6 in ~100 games (even when playing f2p).  You can be good at the game without all the ""gold crap"", and you don't need a premium account to afford firing gold when you need to, especially below tier8.  If you don't have much time to play the game, but you're willing to invest time when you can, buying a day of premium for your gaming session might be a good idea, to make the most out of your time.  If you have time, but only log on a couple times a month, to play a couple games, buying premium time won't do much for you.  Having a t8 premium moneymaker is nice, but it's not even necessary below tier8, as you can make a profit even on a standard account if you're playing well."

WorldofTanks,3dwy1u,WhenUniversesCollide,5,Mon Jul 20 07:06:41 2015 UTC,"French tanks are known for their low armor values and huge, high pen guns.   They've got a lower skill floor and a high skill ceiling, so it takes a lot more knowledge of game mechanics and maps to play them.  I'd recommend American or soviet heavie/medium lines, as they're the most well rounded in all respects. Armor, dpm, depression, as well as general playability.  I thought otherwise when I first started as well, since the elc amx is what drew me into the game. I ground it out first, and stuck through it for roughly 400 games now. I've certainly also made my way up to the tier 7 Russian heavy, the is, and the tier 8 Russian medium, the obj 416. Both are amazing fun tanks that are much easier to excel in than any of the French lines.   While I have had success with the French lines, it's more so after gaining crew skills and other game knowledge from the Russian lines.   Do what you want, but that's my 2 cents .  Edit: I also completely missed the whole point of the post. Since French lines have that high skill low armor type thing, you generally gain less experience per game if you don't know how to use them.  Since you could be excelling in something with more armor and just as much firepower, just less mobility, you may be experiencing the lower exp gain from simply not doing as well.  Edit2: premium account and a tier 8 premium. Vehicle( once you decide what you like to play and have learned more about the game you can decide which one to buy) are very useful.  Premium account mostly. Besides it's very cheap for how much we play the game right?"

WorldofTanks,3dwy1u,Bouboupiste,0,Mon Jul 20 16:44:20 2015 UTC,"Higher skill floor means the skill required to perform decently (aka using the tank to its capacities and not goofing around in it) is higher.  Skill floor is the amount of skill to play decently and skill ceiling the maximum skill level which will change significantly your results.  Take an example : the KV1 / KV1S : the KV1 is easier to play as a newcomer (thanks to the extra armor). It has a lower skill floor. The KV1S however is harder to play as a newcomer ( a newcomer can't exploit the added mobility to it's fullest and will die faster). However, in the hands of a skilled player, the results with the KV1S will be greater thanks to the added mobility successfully exploited. The KV1S therefore has a higher skill ceiling. That exemple may not be the best but it's the first that comes to my mind. As a rule of thumb, in most video games, complexity and fragility increase the skill floor and ceiling."
WorldofTanks,3dwy1u,cbraga,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:49:01 2015 UTC,No. When speaking of measurable quantities the floor is the lowest you can measure. For exemple your pressure sensor has a floor of 100kPa that means you can put it in vacuum and still it will measure 100kPa.  Likewise if your sensor is the KV1 and any tomato does okish getting 500 wn8 thats its floor and in a light tank he would get 100wn8 and it has a lower floor than the kv1.

Unless being used as what I said  on DotA, LoL, Smite, TF2, GW2 and countless other games means nothing, but then everyone is wrong and you're the only one possessing the true wisdom.   Edit : where your measurement makes no sense, by the way, is a simple exemple : you miss all your shots in a KV1 : 0wn8. You miss all your shots in a ELC AMX : 0 wn8. So for a bad player the skill floor is the same for both I guess ?"

Tier 7 and up, the stock grinds lengthen quite a bit, the grinds get longer, exponentially longer.   So that tier 7 you grinded out maybe... 50k xp for? Yeah.. the tier 8 is 80-100k xp, then the tier 9 is like 150+k xp. Tier 9 stock grinds are also notoriously atrocious."

WorldofTanks,3dwy1u,WippitGuud,3,Mon Jul 20 17:29:53 2015 UTC,"I made the same mistake you did, and took French first. They're the most challenging tank to start out in, because you can't play then like everyone else is playing tanks."
WorldofTanks,3dwy1u,nightblade001,2,Mon Jul 20 11:09:53 2015 UTC,"You can certainly still be good without buying anything. Most things in this game are pay to progress, not pay to win.  The ELC AMX is a good tank, but you need to learn how to play it. It isn't an easy tank to play, as is true with french tanks in general. Having a single tier 8 prem is nice for credit making, but beyond that you really don't need anything."
WorldofTanks,3dwy1u,vvav,3,Mon Jul 20 07:00:56 2015 UTC,"You can be good at the game without gold, but it definitely takes a bit longer. I think having a prem tank to grind crews is the most important, since having a crew with 1 or 2 skills is the biggest advantage you can have over someone with 80% crews."
WorldofTanks,3dwy1u,dongnguyentuan1889,2,Mon Jul 20 05:39:29 2015 UTC,"You have to play more other player does: * To make credit to buy new tank(it hard and take time my friend) * To train exp and crew * You should have a little mount of gold <100 to spend on demount the module and retrain crew or some * About French line: it hard to play but when you know how to it will very fun to.             Don't shy when use gold, it make you feel easy and more fun to play or when you don't have time. Focus on free premium event tank if you want a credit earning. I think have one in NA server"
WorldofTanks,3dwy1u,Ferph,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:13:23 2015 UTC,"Probably 1500-2000 battles.  I've bought ONE premium, a tier 5. I never bought gold. I'm a cheapskate and I admit it. That said I'm an above average player, nothing special, with a 53% win rate. I carry a few credit-bought gold shells with me but rarely use them.  Non-payers need to play tier 5 to earn the cash. Tier 5 is easier than tier 8 so your winrate goes up compared to paying players who rush to tier 8 and up and face more experienced players.  ALSO if you want to spend the cash, get a tier 8 premium. It should fund your gold ammo easily."
WorldofTanks,3dwy1u,BeeM4n,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:37:59 2015 UTC,"You can be good for free. You can use gold ammo, but you will need some tier 5 or tier 6 tank for grinding money, but it still be for free (I choose even better option, I just don't use prem ammo. Using those is to complicated, imo. You need to grind, to switch between regular and gold ammo all the time). And about question in header: You sure can, I started playing this game long time ago, and I had some problems moving further tier 7, I always had a lot of tanks, and always had option to buy some new tank, so I never had enougth credits for tier 8, I had to buy month of prem to leave this circle (and to get free t34 =) ) Meanwhile this was no problem for my mate, who started some time after me, cuz he was targeting only 1 lane (Patton), he sure started sov AT lane to support 1st lane with credits, but he didn't by a single prem day and got his MT9 (there was no MT10 at the moment) in very short time. So to summ up: You sure can play this game without spending a penny, You can get tier10 tank and play it regulary with some conditions. And if you target only one lane this will not take that long."
WorldofTanks,3dwy1u,That_Unknown_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:42:10 2015 UTC,"Experience wise heres the math:  Average teir 10 grind is about 750k exp total.  An average player makes maybe 500 exp a game  Thats a total of 1500 games and at an average of 7 minutes per game, thats  7 and a quarter days of in game time.  As for credits, assuming an average of 10k credits profit per game with around 15 million required for a reasonable grind with equipment selling tanks you finish thats 1500 games again convieniently.  So a total of 1500 games or a little over a week of your life spent swearing at team mates, being useless yet confident and getting clicked by arty."
WorldofTanks,3dwy1u,Vaarsuvius13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:41:17 2015 UTC,"I know it doesn't have anything to do with playing without premium, but something to keep in mind is that as you progress you can make gold without spending.  Keep an eye on tournaments as well as consider grinding toward the more tournament viable tanks. The American lights are great with the tier 5-7 all being welcome in their tier tournaments. With a competent team you can make a thousand or two gold per month. Not a lot, but you only need 2500 gold to get a month of premium. From there if you get into a good clan you can be making tens of thousands of gold per month between cw and tournies. But that's seriously for someone with all the right tanks and is a good player with a good team/clan.  But especially keep an eye out for the special tournaments.  Things like the furious five and grand finals countdown. Half the teams won gold in those, so as long as you get a team that can show up for all their games you'll probably qualify for at least 1k gold."
WorldofTanks,3dwy1u,Gandaran,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:51:59 2015 UTC,"I've yet to spend money on this game. Takes ~ 1,000 games to get to tier 10 playing well."

It helps though that I'm not really targeting a tier 10 or anything. I just find tanks I like at any tier and play them for fun, while grinding everything else really slowly with only daily doubles. There are some tanks I don't even do doubles on, just triples or x5's on weekends. I ended up getting through the Birch Gun using almost only triples / x5's."
WorldofTanks,3dwy1u,Graybie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:37:19 2015 UTC,"It would be more helpful to know how many games you have played to get to where you are than to know you have played for about a year. Or just give us your username so we can look up your stats and tanking history.  Short answer is that premium will let you get 50% further in the same amount of time. Getting a tier 10 tank for a brand new player is probably about 2000 battles in that line. Could be more if you are really terrible, or a lot less if you are very good."
WorldofTanks,3dwy1u,Dae314,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:48:35 2015 UTC,"I did not have a premium account for my first 3 tier 10 grinds.  I did have a few premium tanks though. And I kept a small amount of gold (primarily earned through events) that I used solely to unmount complex modules.  I only painted maybe 1 tank the entire time, and I kept gold ammo usage (bought with silver of course) to a minimum.  For grinding strategy, I primarily just did daily 2x (so 1 win in each grind tank then I'd close the game for the night), but for some weekend events I'd do a long grind.  Doing those 3 lines at the same time in this manner took me approximately 5000 battles iirc.  Might've been closer to 5500.  In real life time it took me just a couple months under 2 years of play time.  After completing my grinds in this manner, I felt really good about the time and enjoyment I had gotten out of WoT.  I recently bought premium time more as a gesture of thanks to WG than as a means of progression.  I do have to admit though that with the experience I gained doing my first 3 lines and the new premium account, the lines I'm currently grinding are going much faster.  If I wasn't taking so much time to play WoWS, I'd probably have another 2 or 3 tier 10s before the end of the year ^^."

Arty doesn't expose itself, it isn't vulnerable to enemy fire, except from counter arty and its very easy to prevent it. Think about it, no other tank can one shot tanks one tier higher, and arty gets invulnerability.   Yes you could kemp bush and use camo to your advantage, but that requires skill and knowledge of the game mechanics. Arty just requires you to stay at a corner of the map.

WorldofTanks,3dutge,MrSirShakes,2,Mon Jul 20 13:59:47 2015 UTC,"I have been hit blind by arty one time in 8000 games. The potential one shot on a tier higher tank doesn't make it OP either, since it happens maybe 1/50 shots. Arty is fucking shit, it's shit to play as and even shitter to play against, but that doesn't mean it's overpowered - look at the average damage per game and win rate, arty is almost always the lowest in its tier. It's just very badly designed.  High win rate players almost always have lower win rate in arty, and low win rate players almost always have higher win rate in arty. It is almost always the lowest damage in its tier. Arty is 95% luck, 5% skill, it is poorly designed and needs to be changed. It is not overpowered though."

WorldofTanks,3dtc4u,trace12,9,Sun Jul 19 06:47:07 2015 UTC,It is identical to the VK 36.01H is almost every single way. If you like the VK and want a premium trainer/credit maker then I say it is well worth it.  http://tanks.gg/en/wot/ht-no-vi#tab:details.compare:vk-3601-h
WorldofTanks,3dtc4u,Kyoeishinkirou,2,Sun Jul 19 11:07:29 2015 UTC,"I don't get why so few compare it to that VK, they're very similar. I enjoy both, the most notable difference is that the japtiger is bigger, but has better side armor (80 vs VK's 60)."
WorldofTanks,3dtc4u,grrrrumble,2,Sun Jul 19 11:35:04 2015 UTC,Exactly. It's a VK you angle like a Tiger. Job done.
WorldofTanks,3dtc4u,nolo_me,12,Sun Jul 19 14:23:53 2015 UTC,"I have about 85% w/r in mine and let me explain how due to the strengths and weaknesses of it.  As top tier you are extremely strong, you have armor, dpm and HP to work with, and decent mobility.  As mid or low tier you become a ranged dpm flanker (NOT A SNIPER). The gun does not have enough pen to go through T7 and T8 tanks frontal reliably with gold, and AP is simply no good. Things like IS3's and T32's are simply not worth the time unless you are flanking.  Here is where the tank is great, I have a female crew from my 260 grind being done. The view range is amazing and I use vent rammer optics to compliment this. Many games I have out spotted mediums and pulled tanks out of camo prior to firing.  For experienced players with T10's: Top tier = Brawl, Push, Carry  Bottom Tier = Play like an E5, medium distance and flank when possible.  Good luck!"
WorldofTanks,3dtc4u,Goonswarmz,6,Sun Jul 19 10:56:03 2015 UTC,I  think that's more a case of you having a BIA + optics + whatever equipment while everybody else is running 80% no skill at tier 6?

WorldofTanks,3dtc4u,Finchypoo,6,Sun Jul 19 06:51:19 2015 UTC,The thing is though that it is not the same as a tiger. It's stats are almost identical to the tier IV VK 36.01.

Some things you might want to consider though in terms of costs. It starts with a 5 man crew at 50% training so do you want to retrain it for 1k gold when you start playing it, or 100k silver at 75% training and grind through a bit (What I'm doing).  When the new heavies come out whenever, you'll have to retrain the crew and again decide between gold or silver.  We also don't know how many crews the new heavies will require - I don't recall where I read it, but one was said to have up to 11 crew members historically.  We'll have to wait and see what WG does."
WorldofTanks,3dtc4u,ShhDynasty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:23:46 2015 UTC,I bought it. No regrets. Cost me £10. It's basically a partially upgraded Tiger at a lower tier. It's a little sluggish but it kicks arse when top tier. Load the gold for tier 8s :)

Was thinking the SA35 CA looked like it had a pretty good gun for tier, ARL V39 also.  Is it like a French toaster, all gun, no armor?  How's the mobility?  Ain't going all the way, but I like to at least check out some of the On Track vehicles, see if there's any keepers or just fun TDs to run."
WorldofTanks,3dtzq4,Xo0om,4,Sun Jul 19 17:16:10 2015 UTC,"Somua is basically a slower Hetzer, not too bad, but not a great tank.  S35 CA is awesome.   ARL V39, not really that good, in large part due to high profile, due to mini-turret, and very low mounted gun with poor horizontal movement. You can't really use cover, but your guns at least are good.   AC 46, good tank, I found, usable armor, depression makes it even better, and can largely negate the 2 cupolas on the top. Great 105mm that uses the same ammo as the 50 100.  AC 48, where I'm currently at, good frontal, has obvious weakspots on the top, sides are paper and arty loves you. I really like the tank, as it's fast and has a good selection in guns."

WorldofTanks,3dtzq4,ABetterKamahl1234,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:51:27 2015 UTC,"I'm up to the AMX AC 48. So far the line has been fraught with bad armour, questionable speed and sometimes mediocre guns for tier. At the 48 it's decently mobile with a nice 120mm and the frontal armour is great... but there are huge weak spots on the roof and the sides are ridiculously thin at 40mm so you risk over match by the common 122mm+ guns."

WorldofTanks,3dtzq4,Vaarsuvius13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:35:35 2015 UTC,S35 CA was great until the view range nerf. I haven't bothered with it since.
WorldofTanks,3dtzq4,boucem,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:46:10 2015 UTC,"I'm agreeing with the other comments here so far, though I've still used my lower-tier TDs (in general) with some success since the view range nerf; they just can't be right behind the front line and Eye of Sauron the entire map anymore.  That's more important with the S35 than, say, the T40 or SU-85B because the S35 is not very mobile.  But the S35 was always a choice of ridiculously-powerful guns with questionable gun handling, mounted to a clumsy bathtub.  The main issue with the French TD line in the mid to upper tiers is that the gun handling is generally bad.  As you go up the line, the top gun for each TD usually features worse gun handling than the gun immediately before it, as a trade for better alpha and penetration."
WorldofTanks,3dtzq4,KptKrondog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"The tier 5, 7, 8, and 9 are all good. The 10 is still good, it just got nerfed too much so it's not really worth getting unless you just don't care about CW tanks or have an abundance of credits.  The ARL V39 is worth skipping though. It's easily one of the worst tanks in the game behind the Churchill Gun Carrier and Challenger IMO."

Hence why theres so many random tanks from so many nations. Even BF-109's were used in the air force.   They are known for taking existing tanks and throwing on a shitton of modifications. like the M51 Super Sherman or the Tiran 4sh which was a T-55 with their version of the Royal Ordiance L7.

WorldofTanks,3dv6kw,Daydroy,5,Sun Jul 19 20:01:43 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what types of tanks you normally play since you can stick crews from other tanks of the same nation/type in a premium tank with no penalty.  So if you play a lot of German medium tanks the Panther 8.8 would be a good choice.   Of all the tier 8's in the shop I think there are two that really stand out, the Soviet IS-6 and the French AMX CDC.  The CDC is not just one of the best tier 8 premium tanks, it's one of the better tier 8's in the game.  Great speed and gun depression but very bad armor.   The IS-6 is a very solid tank with the added benefit of preferential matchmaking so it will never see tier 10 tanks.  Against tanks with mediocre penetration the armor is absolutely troll, it has the best rate of fire of all the Russian 122mm (non-TD) guns, and it's nimble.  The only weak point is the pen but not seeing 10's helps a ton."
WorldofTanks,3dv6kw,IKabobI,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:39:00 2015 UTC,I was thinking of the panther 8.8 because i have the vk30.02d and i enjoy its playstyle but i wasnt sure.
WorldofTanks,3dv6kw,IKabobI,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:54:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly at tier 6 you have no idea if you're gonna stick with the tank line, and while the Panther 8.8 is one of the cheaper tier 8 premiums it's still a nice chunk of change. I'd avoid buying it until you unlock and have several games in the Panther II (which is probably a better tank than the 8.8).  As others have mentioned you should also consider a lower tier premium.  Jumping straight to a tier 8 premium when you have no experience in the tier is a bad idea and going from seeing a max enemy of tier 8 to a max of tier 10 is going to boggle your mind."

WorldofTanks,3dr5gc,That_Unknown_Guy,2,Sun Jul 19 05:22:58 2015 UTC,235mm pen for a tier 10 front line heavy isn't that good. Combine that with the meh accuracy and you have a gun which does well against thin-skinned targets but not against the front of other heavy tanks which it has to shoot at. The amazing accuracy and the dpm of the FV means more shots will hit and penetrate in a shorter amount of time.
WorldofTanks,3dr5gc,herminipper,0,Sun Jul 19 06:39:24 2015 UTC,"235mm pen for a tier 10 front line heavy isn't that good   But 334 sure as hell is, and thats what most decent e100s will be firing when it matters.

WorldofTanks,3dr5gc,tmichael921,-1,Mon Jul 20 03:53:19 2015 UTC,Good e100s can change their ammo with the press of a key..... And good e100s can hit that same soft bulge with heat anyhow. You didnt find some magical loophole through my logic. You nitpicked something with an obvious solution.
WorldofTanks,3dr5gc,That_Unknown_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:11:39 2015 UTC,You play a tank to its strengths. That's how you adapt and get good. Not around what you want it to do.
WorldofTanks,3dr5gc,Metallicpoop,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:33:27 2015 UTC,"So clearly that means that every tank is good and if you call a tank bad you clearly just dont understand how to play...  Really, low alpha in a heavy tank is a disadvantage. I never said that makes the 215b a bad tank as it gets some compensation, but  again, for what heavies (including the 215) do best, the e100s gun is better"
WorldofTanks,3dr5gc,That_Unknown_Guy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:48:59 2015 UTC,"The gun isn't the problem, it's the trash hull and rear mounted turret. If the turret is in the middle or towards the front, and the hull can actually bounce, it will be fine. The gun doesn't need any buffs at all, it's on par with the 50B and the 113 for the best guns on any heavy."
WorldofTanks,3dr5gc,YOU-ESS-AY,0,Mon Jul 20 13:13:42 2015 UTC,the entire tank is OP as shit. being rear mounted allows for some great shenanigans and the hull isn't bad.

WorldofTanks,3dr5gc,YOU-ESS-AY,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:31:12 2015 UTC,"What's funny? its true. the upper front plate is strong against everything but gold spam. Sure the lower plate is trash but that's the weakpoint... The turret is strong, rear mounted means you dont have to expose much of your weak sides when sidescraping, and the gun is probably the 2nd best, (if not the best) gun in the game."
WorldofTanks,3dr5gc,Gandaran,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:38:10 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/lOvvAmI.png  Best sidescraper for sure. Also the sides get overmatched by every 155mm gun. It's also incredibly long, so you can't play aggressive as you just get tracked and set on fire if you go around a corner without sidescraping, and the majority of the tank is an easy penetration from arty shells. Its gun is amazing, no one is denying that, but the hull is incredibly shit."
WorldofTanks,3dr5gc,YOU-ESS-AY,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:17:52 2015 UTC,Sidescrape at extreme angles (basically 80* ish)....  most players end up just putting shots into your tracks for zero.

WorldofTanks,3dr5gc,DankandSpank,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:15:31 2015 UTC,"except that you are more likely to get killed before finishing your first clip than you are to get 4k damage,  you have no camo after you shoot and very little before then, you are a huge tall soft target that arty and any other tank in range focuses over any other tank, and you are slow, and ROF is great right up until you fire your clip, then you are a huge slow squishy target that can't protect itself for 60 seconds, at that point you can basically get shot at 2 or 3 times depending on the enemy arty before you can shoot your second clip, the WT auf E100 is far from a strong tank in almost any situation after its nerfs especially with the frequency that crew die and the gun breaks which is basically every hit you take"

WorldofTanks,3dr5gc,UsaRoxAll,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:13:30 2015 UTC,It will gain a hulldown capability and lose its sidescraping capability. However it will be a bit faster than the FV so something has to go. Either that or they nerf the terrain resistance to make it stay the same and it keeps the rof.
WorldofTanks,3dr5gc,herminipper,5,Sun Jul 19 06:43:10 2015 UTC,"Fv215b already can hull down very well. And if you sidescrape in the fv215b, any half decent player will rip you apart."

WorldofTanks,3dtcim,talen10,7,Sun Jul 19 06:53:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on if you want an answer to the question you asked or the question you probably meant to ask.  World of Tanks anniversary events are in April.  There will definitely be discounts, probably a free gift tank of some sort, and based off the thing from Rita's blog they might do something bigger than normal for 5 years.  It's going to be a while before this stuff happens though.  Now, Wargaming celebrates its anniversary in August.  There also tends to be discounts sometimes a free tank and other things.  Ever since they implemented them special missions and game modes seem to also come with large events.  The thing about these sorts of events is that we don't really know exactly what's going to happen in them, or exactly when they're going to be until they are announced officially.  Anyone here who tells you specific dates isn't basing them off real legitimate information (I suppose if they have the ""verified wargaming employee"" flair you can probably trust them, but I doubt any will answer with useful information).  Maybe their guesses could be right, but until there's a post on worldoftanks.com (or .eu or .ru or wherever else) it's all just speculation."

Either that's a replay bug, or I'm using 1337 h4xx without even knowing it.   I do however, take a lot of risky snapshots. And that's a bad habit that gets me a lot of incoming damage after I miss.

WorldofTanks,3dt04q,uberglu,3,Sun Jul 19 05:23:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not gonna tell you certain positions, but ALWAYS keep in mind, that the game is 15 minutes long and there is no need for you to rush. Sit at the back and use some bushes. If you can see there's a LT on your team rushing for some initial spots, go and cover him. 704 has some nice alpha damage, so use it to your advantage. Cheers!"
WorldofTanks,3dt04q,KingSTEELO47,2,Sun Jul 19 04:24:49 2015 UTC,"The Obj 704 is a great TD: as good as the T30 in some ways. It is surprisingly mobile, but you don't use that to rush the enemy, you use the speed to get to the best firing position that you can where you know the enemy must pass (channel points). An example is pushing up to the bushes in the midfield on Fishing Village right at the start in order to get side shots on the heavies grinding their way to the city side. Another used to be the 'hill bush' on Swamp south spawn (gone now), but you get the point.   Watch how the battle shapes, look for tanks that have remaining HP <750. Target them first to get their guns out of the battle. In the midgame in particular, you can get a little more aggressive, coming around corners. I use AP on everything except frontal aspect heavies - your APCR can rip almost every tank in the game from the front (4502B, E3 can be tough). I only use HE to reset or if I can catch a Waffle, an AMX50B or so forth - full power HE pen is devasting.   Run BIA, then sixth and shooty skills, then camo, then repair. I recommend Rammer/Vents/Optics in order to maximize my shooting ability - this tank is about the gun, not the stealth. The anti TD meta means you can no longer camp bushes easily, so skills and gear that benefit a mobile approach makes sense. After 170 games, I am 2400DPG and 900XPG, which is above average, but not high enough to suit me. I will be keeping mine."
WorldofTanks,3dt04q,ratseal,4,Sun Jul 19 05:06:47 2015 UTC,"If he has female crew he already has SOS as first skill then next skill should be sixth for the commander and camo for the rest.  Then the next one should camo on the commander and shooting/driving skills on the rest.   This line of TD's has insane camo when used with camo paint/crew/net  My SU-152 when in bug bush has 97.5 camo rating when sitting still,  that means an enemy must be 50m away for proxy spot to be able to see you.   The ISU and 704are similar.   So what I am saying came skill is the first one you need."

WorldofTanks,3dt04q,nolo_me,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:01:15 2015 UTC,"If he has the female BIA perk then I say go straight to shooty skills plus Sixth for the commander and Clutch for the driver. After shooty skills get camo and then repair. I maintain that the meta has shifted so far from camping TDs that you have to play mobile - thus shooty+optics+vents > camo net and bino. By all means camo up the crew and paint the tank, though."
WorldofTanks,3dt04q,ratseal,2,Sun Jul 19 22:43:35 2015 UTC,"It's not a glass cannon. Don't sit in the open trading shots, but it's got trollish armor, especially at long ranges. Autoaim in close quarters. When you get flanked or overrun, concentrate on your driving. That B-C zipping to get past your gun is only going to give you one shot; make it count. Coming around corners at tanks that are reloading, you want to get the first shot off (especially when it's likely to kill them). For 90% of tanks, it doesn't matter where you aim--you're going to pen. Don't snipe unless you're fully aimed. Accuracy isn't the BL-10's strong point. Don't waste those 152mm shells. Target selection: At long range, choose the most hp, most armored tanks to help the team. At close range, target tanks you can one-shot."
WorldofTanks,3dt04q,JSMorin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:50:12 2015 UTC,"rammer, vents, and binos? Maybe try rammer, GLD, and vents/binos. That faster aiming is very nice.  I think the Obj 704 is one of the best TDs in the game right now. Make sure you are in nice bushes or near hard cover and just demolish the enemy if they push at you. Once you start winning a flank, you can easily switch to aggressive mode and help push with the heavies. The 704 doesn't have dependable armor, but it can troll low tier tanks, and even occasionally frustrate tier 10s.   Basically, key is to do damage without getting spotted in the beginning of the game, and then be aggressive with your HP and massive alpha at the end of the game."
WorldofTanks,3dt04q,Graybie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:07:55 2015 UTC,"Full camo crew makes it so that you have the chance to choose your engagements and shoot the opponent you choose when you choose.   On the T30 I won't take camo skills as first option because the turret offers way more flexibility, but for turretless  td's I think it's imperative to get the chance to initiate and maybe even remain unspotted after shooting. Also for  turret less td's shooting skills are not so hot as for turreted ones.   But I guess everyone can play as they wish.   I just know that since I switched on my meds and most of my td's to camo as first skill,  my wn8 has gone up a lot.   For example my Cent 7/1 who is a huge tank has like 29/24 camo rating and 585m view range thus making me able to outspot most other tanks that are not bushing."

People may say that damaged dealt is not necessarily the best indicator of skill, but the curve tends to follow through with skill, i.e. it's the purples rocking 3 marks, not that tomato spearheading the lemming train. However, I don't feel that the factors you mention here are viable for marking achievements:   Tanks spotted - firstly, this is very class specific, you won't be getting very many spots off in your heavies and TDs, and if you're getting any in artillery then you're definitely playing it wrong (1 spot in a game = instant 3 marks for most arty pieces). Secondly, as you said, this can be very prone to abuse due to suicide scouting, and we may even find a banana curve in which only the very best and very worst of players rock 3 marks. Spotting damage - this could perhaps work, although assisted damage is already pooled with damage dealt to calculate the current MoE, making them viable for scout tanks as well, who tend to deal less damage. The same problem as mentioned above, that of it being rather class specific, would also make it difficult to justify having separate marks for spotting damage. Damage taken - ...why? This is not really a marker of skill in any way. A tomato might make a stupid peek and lose most of his hitpoints rendering him a useless camper for the rest of the game, and a unicum might trade effectively for the entire match finishing top and come of with the same 'skill' as the tomato at the end of the game. On the plus side, maybe getting nuked by arty wouldn't be such a bad thing? (""Fuck you Mr. T92, I just picked up my third mark <3""). Btw, surely it would better if you got 3 marks for taking the least damage? (By no means a good factor to judge MoE, just more logical than taking the most damage?)"
WorldofTanks,3dsf6e,SirTuffers,4,Sun Jul 19 01:20:06 2015 UTC,"People may say that damaged dealt is not necessarily the best indicator of skill   It's not just that though.  It's damage contribution, which is your damage plus spotting (assisted) damage.  Damage contribution is a very good proxy for performance given that the more you are doing and spotting, and staying alive sustainably to do it, the more you are contributing to your team.  In my experience, in order to get 1 MoE you need to be active and competent (blue level) on a tank.  To get 2 MoE you need to consistently perform at a high Unicum or Super Unicum level.  To get 3 MoE you need to consistently perform at deep into Super Unicum territory.  TLDR: 2 and 3 marks are not easy to get, but that's how it should be."
WorldofTanks,3dsf6e,_taugrim_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:25:03 2015 UTC,"For me:  1 MoE ~ ""played the tank for 100 games and isn't a tomato""  2 MoE ~ ""good player in general and on that tank""  3 MoE ~ ""wow, lets stick around after death to check his play out/chat him up to get some tips on the tank if I  have it as well""  3 MoEs might mean a lot less, depending on the tank: I have them on my M103, which is more a testament to how statpadderish that tank is than to my skill in general or my HT skill in particular."

WorldofTanks,3dsco3,spamsince,2,Sun Jul 19 00:31:52 2015 UTC,"I personally suggest you go down the turreted line, hellcat - t25/2 - to the T28 Prot, where you can grind the guns on a tank that has a turret, then you can get the T28 from the T28 Prot and proceed on the turret less line. The T28 does require tracks before mounting the 120 though."
WorldofTanks,3dsco3,gehtsmahn,0,Sun Jul 19 00:26:49 2015 UTC,"Again, time investments.  If you want to do it the most efficient way, you go down the Hellcat path and then you can branch out in two lines at tier 8.  Means two tier IX and X tanks that you can get."
WorldofTanks,3dsco3,Christo92K,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:30:36 2015 UTC,"The T110E3 line is very frustrating to go up because with each tank you lose speed. Starting with the T67 which is very fast, with each tier you become less versatile, up until you hit the T95 which is an absolute turtle of a tank. I'd say the turreted line, while not necessarily a ""better"" line on a tank per tank basis, is much more enjoyable to play."

WorldofTanks,3dsco3,Bulletti,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:43:11 2015 UTC,"I agree. The problem is that the t28/t94 and to an extent the E3 suit the turtling playstyle over all others. bu these days with fast t10meds, fast high tier lights etc if you're not protected then you're in trouble. Gold spamming reduces the turtleness of the t95, even from the front. So in a pub you're either God or your easy meat depending entirely on your whether your team helps or ignores you. plus with the t95 I've NEVER had so many games where you can win/lose by shooting nothing and doing nothing as play moves so fast that its over before you make contact with the enemy."
WorldofTanks,3dsco3,Thecna2,2,Sun Jul 19 01:21:23 2015 UTC,"Pubs I like the Jackson more than hellcat. I do have 3 marks in mine so I could be a bit biased. They play very differently though. Jackson is much more brawly with the incredible gun handling and good snapshotting, while hellcat is much more of a Kemp bush td, where your mobility is just to get into good shooting positions. For sh/tourneys hellcat all the way. Jackson is just a bit too slow for that format."

WorldofTanks,3dsco3,JohnnyPoopwater,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:42:29 2015 UTC,"The hellcat is faster, and has much better camo. The jackson has slightly better DPM and isn't especially vulnerable to HE rounds or tier 4 tanks, or the rare loadouts of higher tier tanks like people running the Derp on the cromwell or comet. The hellcat is for the most part the better choice because it's faster, and despite having much less armor, the point of early no British TDs is not to get shot.  It's nice to have the 105mm unlocked from the T25 AT, but the fact is both T28s are a huge pain to play without the 120mm, it'd be smartest to obtain free exp for both guns, but if that's too difficult, you'll 100% want the 105mm already unlocked.  Similarly, it might be best to get the 155mm on the T30 before moving on to the T95 because the T95 is basically the slowest tank in the game, it needs the alpha.  Last tip: If you're going for a tier X, the E3 is for the most part considered better than the E4 since the E3's armor is just amazing, while the E4's is considerably weaker, though sturdy."

I understand that some people have no competitive drive at all and no desire to win (although it drives me nuts as to why they choose to play online multiplayer gaming with those traits).   But how can you actually be more of a hindrance to your team than an AFK? The average AFK I saw has a 45% winrate, IMO anything between 49-51 is normal, 47-48 is bad, 46-45 is bot-levels anything under 45 is actively preventing your team from winning...  If he just played for fun and shot his gun every once in a while (missing everything) he should still have a 45% win-rate... 46% if he rolls in the right direction and absorbs some shots..."
WorldofTanks,3dtrqd,MrAFMB,5,Sun Jul 19 12:16:19 2015 UTC,"Like you said, the fact that he's always in upper-tier heavy tanks probably has an effect. There's also the problem that when someone is AFK you can tell, and you don't rely on them. When you have a 4~5 vs 3 heavy tank push you might play more aggressively not realizing you really don't have that extra tank there."

WorldofTanks,3dtrqd,uzicecfc,2,Sun Jul 19 12:43:22 2015 UTC,That's about average for someone who's never touched a game and has very little grasp of the mechanics when they started playing. As long as you keep improving no one will care how your first 1k~ battles as long as the next 2k+ go better (that's also around the time you should have gotten a tier 8 or two if you haven't been grinding straight for a t10).
WorldofTanks,3dtrqd,OrangeDreamed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:09:32 2015 UTC,"I can imagine that lower tier Win-Rates are skewed by seal-clubbers, if some have a 68% winrate, some have to have a 40% one, but after tier 3-4 it get's really hard to solo the enemy team in a single tank (like the old T18, Pz II J could/can) so the seal clubbers disappear and the win rate does not depend on which team has the Pz II J anymore at which point it averages quickly."

He wasn't trolling or going afk, i think he was just absorbed in shooting tanks in sniper mode and completely oblivious to what's happening around him. His tank (and soon his wreck) kept two top tier tanks out of the fight for a bit and prevented them to get into a good position early."
WorldofTanks,3dtrqd,iYokay,2,Sun Jul 19 12:13:39 2015 UTC,"As someone who had a 36% win rate and 55 battles in the M12, it is most definitely possible without being a bad player.  I played all 55 battles yesterday after unlocking the M12, and even with an average damage of over 1,300 I still ended up with a 36% win rate.  It's insane how incompetent players seem to be lately, even more so during this 3x weekend.  No matter how much damage I do we still seem to lose."

WorldofTanks,3dtrqd,mistralol,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:14:26 2015 UTC,"They are a lot. But there can be a lot done to actually help your team from an SPG and it really depends on what you shoot.  Some things that really help would be to take out a scout in a difficult or risky place for your team to be able to kill it (thus saving 2-3 tanks and getting the rest unspotted)  Or simply getting tanks off the field. eg removing 4-5 lower tier tanks (that arty can pen) instead of 1 top tier tank really shifts the battle in your favour for numbers.  Or sometimes its the reverse. where you just need to nail a WT-E100 that's camping at the back just waiting to do a load of damage to your team.  Arty is there to ""over watch"" the team and help when and where help is required. Something I see a lot of low skill arty players do over and over is to go and sit in the furthest corner. they only hit 1 in 3 shots all game because of the added distance.  I remember doing 4k games with the M12 on a regular bases and having 5+ kills a lot its really good SPG for its tier but you have to hit with it."

But I'd argue that there's a lot of people that play this game merely to drive a tank around and have some fun while shooting at other tanks. The first 2000 battles I played I kept thinking how weird it was that I could suck so much at a game and still enjoy it. Should be said though: i am far from good player even now, but i still have fun playing  I guess my point with all these posts is that I don't understand why people think they have any say in how other people should enjoy their game."

I think that people get exceptionally riled up about bad players in WoT because you can't really choose where you're playing and most importantly because people can and do track their stats obsessively.  Someone else screws up and it's perceived as directly impacting your value in the universe.  My flipside to this would be Team Fortress 2, where even after all this time people will mock snipers trying to shoot through windows and teleporter exits that face into corners, and you can enrage people by eating sandwiches in the spawn room for 30 minutes, but there's not nearly as much of this postgame chase-down-and-vent-spleen-at.  It helps in the case of TF2 that people can be kicked from servers, you can respawn, and you can always build your own server with blackjack and hookers if you don't like how other people are doing things.  Here we're all riding in WG's flame-spouting Mad Max caravan.  That said, I would love it if WG put in a single-player tutorial or mode that wasn't utterly useless.  I'd still rather have people be allowed to mess around with a Tier 10 or shooting HE at buildings all day on their own time instead of rolling into games with 29 other people and not knowing or caring what is going on.  Training rooms aren't enough."
WorldofTanks,3dtrqd,GoGoGadgetBeer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:31:42 2015 UTC,"It's not whether they enjoy the game or not, it's the sheer fact of being bad and being curious as to why they're that bad (and in the case of WoT, having to rely on these sorts of players to not die so you can kill the people they can't).   You can't tell me you're not legitimately curious as to how you can manage a 30% winrate in t8 premiums. That's fucking awful, by any reckoning. I have a 57% winrate in WoT and I still feel like I lose at least 60% of my battles, and it makes me rage quit on occasion, how can someone ACTUALLY HAVE THAT WINRATE, AND CONTINUE PLAYING WITHOUT IMPROVING? It boggles the mind."
WorldofTanks,3dtrqd,Graybie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:56:29 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's a puzzle I'd very much like to have an answer for, but my point is that I don't think it's right to comment on other people or their enjoyment of the game. There's probably tons of people playing the game that doesn't care if they win or lose, they just want to shoot some tanks. I guess the difference here is simply wanting to have fun vs actually competing. (Personally I prefer trying to learn and get better, but experience has taught me that not everyone shares this view)  And I'm sure you'd be a lot of successful in getting people to learn by being polite. The standard method of contact people (or commenting about them) in WoT seems to be: ""Idiot"" ""Retarded noob"", etc.  I'm around 51-52% winrate and I'd love to have someone contact me with constructive criticism and suggestions, but I just ignore people messaging just to say ""fucking l2p you fat noob"" whenever I do something incredibly stupid."
WorldofTanks,3dtrqd,GoGoGadgetBeer,3,Sun Jul 19 14:13:12 2015 UTC,If you want constructive criticism or suggestions you will need to contact other better players first and ask for them. We generally don't contact anyone with anything positive because it just ends with us  getting told to fuck off.
WorldofTanks,3dtrqd,Graybie,2,Sun Jul 19 15:18:52 2015 UTC,"Probably true.  I usually take the time to think through what I did wrong when I fuck up badly though. In an attempt to prevent myself from doing that again.   My point was that a unicum would accomplish a lot more with randoms by being polite over telling them to ""fuck off and learn to play idiot kurwa"". This is just my point of view though."
WorldofTanks,3dtrqd,OrangeDreamed,2,Sun Jul 19 16:42:39 2015 UTC,"Almost every unicum started out doing that. Take a guess at how it goes. Now most of us just vent, since the outcome is basically the same (getting bitched at if you didn't guess right).   People can only take so much of, ""Don't tell me how to play you noob."""
WorldofTanks,3dtrqd,GoGoGadgetBeer,2,Sun Jul 19 17:47:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's right to comment on other people or their enjoyment   Well, you're wrong there, it's perfectly fine to comment on people, hell, he even blacked out the names. There's not a single thing that breaks anyone's rights here (no, people don't have the right to not be criticised, they have the right to be deaf to that criticism but they don't have the right to mute it FOR EVERYONE ELSE).    And I'm sure you'd be a lot of successful in getting people to learn by being polite. The standard method of contact people (or commenting about them) in WoT seems to be: ""Idiot"" ""Retarded noob"", etc.   This comes from both highly skilled player and the worst of the worst and everyone in between, the difference is, the highly skilled players actually have a bit of credence to their name calling when someone does something massively stupid that ruins a game for them.  And 99% of the time it's just frustration being vented, no one should fucking take it personally.   I'm around 51-52% winrate and I'd love to have someone contact me with constructive criticism and suggestions, but I just ignore people messaging just to say ""fucking l2p you fat noob"" whenever I do something incredibly stupid.    Won't happen, at least incredibly rarely due to how WoT is constructed (15 minute games with no post-game lobby). Your only chance to chat for someone for an extended time while you're dead to a fuckup, or if you message them after the game (which most people don't give a fuck about because they'd rather continue grinding)."

A good point I guess. I suppose there's nothing wrong with commenting like that in terms of people and their rights, but I still don't see the point of it. Frustrations being vented like this will fall on deaf ears 99% of the time. (like the answer from the bloke here suggests).  I also fail to see what they are trying to achieve with toxic behaviour. Like you said, the games are 10-15 minute long and all you have to do is load up a new one. You won't get anywhere by yelling at randoms in (or after) a game.  It should be said that I rarely experience anything like this targeted towards me though. Most of the people contacting me accuse me of hacking or moding because ive double-bushed them or something) I'm somewhere in the middle and tend to blend in (unless I do something that screws me over massivly I suppose).

But I wasn't saying he shouldn't play, nor did I post this to make fun of him.  Why did I post a screen?  I've basically already said it 3 times.    How is it even possible to have a 32% win rate over 300 battles in a kv5.  HOW?!!  I seriously do not understand how it is even possible.  It's like that guy who got struck by lighting 7 times in his life, statistically it just seems impossible.  Its not about his being bad (though he is), it's the mechanics of how it's even possible."
WorldofTanks,3dtrqd,ekyzzz,3,Sun Jul 19 12:46:58 2015 UTC,"I guess it might be just be, but ""Why do you even click battle?""  reads like you telling him not to play. Which is why I can understand why he replies as he did as well.  I can't comment on how he has managed to get stats like that, but I have to say I don't really care either. Maybe he's a kid or lets his kids play on his account or something. Over the years of online gaming I've come to realize that there's no point in getting annoyed over what others do or do not do.  you have no control over them (exception being friends and clanmates i suppose) and how they play so I suppose it's better to just go with the flow. Getting frustrated will just throw you into a tilt (granted this is easier said than done some times ;) )"

If you could play every single one of your games against this guy in his kv5, your winrate would be better than 87 of the 99 players in Bulba (one of the best clans in the game).

Its maybe his way of having fun, maybe he doesnt care about stats at all, and yeah, there are always such people who are not as good as the others, we cant help it.

WorldofTanks,3dndb5,knightelite,9,Sat Jul 18 14:00:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely interesting, though it's likely a lot of the weird results are simply due to it being easier for smaller groups to get higher average values (as you need fewer good results to change the average). This is also why it's easier to dramatically change your average WN8 when you've only played 1,000 games than it is when you've played 40,000.  For example, if only 0.05% of people have a 2-letter name then they'll likely have a much higher average WN8 than the 14% of people who have an 8-letter name. This isn't because they're inherently better, it's because it's a lot easier for half-decent players to change the average of 200 people compared to 50,000. Also, the larger groups will likely always be lower due to having enough players to give a more realistic spread of true player skill.  To put it another way, it's likely that people with a short name have a higher average WN8 simply because there are less players with a short name, not because they are somehow better. You can see this in the way the second graph is effectively a mirror of the first one.  This is exactly why you have to be incredibly careful about sample sizes when doing serious statistical analysis, otherwise you'll get all sorts of weird results that aren't actually significant.  It would be good to compare these graphs with another set that use statistically-similar samples from each group. I'd bet the results are quite different!"
WorldofTanks,3dndb5,BassNector,7,Sat Jul 18 21:43:38 2015 UTC,"What you mean to say is that smaller sample sizes will be less representative of the global average. It could go either way though. If the small subset has a couple terrible players, they might be below the global average. If they have a couple amazing players, they will be above. There is no reason the deviation should only be in one direction."
WorldofTanks,3dndb5,wiringeek,4,Fri Jul 17 20:10:14 2015 UTC,"You do have to remember though that there is a lowest possible WN8, while there's no theoretical limit on maximum.  So if the average is 1000 WN8, one player who averages 3000 WN8 cancels out two players who average 0.  Since 0 is the lowest possible number, a very good player can have a larger impact on the average than a very bad player can."
WorldofTanks,3dndb5,BassNector,4,Fri Jul 17 20:17:28 2015 UTC,"There actually is a limit to how high your WN8 can be. The Fv215b183 has a maximum damage per game of 30,625. That's if the player gets all 100% max rolls, all penetrating hits with HESH. Whatever that WN8 is is the maximum WN8 someone can get."

And after the battle he messages us: ""that'll teach you two noobs to test me"" (I guess he's omnipotent. Sorry we challenged his authority—although didn't he challenge us(?)). Anyway that's how that goes. We could only laugh.   TL;DR guy in M103 demands to ""1v1"" me and my pal in our IS and T29, gets lucky one-hit kill on T29, out-tiers me, and battle is over. ""Tells us off"" like he's some bigshot, and that's all, folks."

WorldofTanks,3ds04y,x7x_,2,Sun Jul 19 05:11:26 2015 UTC,"So basically, it wasn't a 1v1, and you purposely gimped yourself when the other guy was talking shit?  You should have let him pick the tier, ready his tank up, then pick yours (same tier of course, don't want it to not be fair).  That's what I did, after 10 minutes of drunkenly trying to get him to actually accept the invite to the training room he was too chicken to follow through on without me calling him out on it.  Then I beat him 1650 to 340. Tier 8, he brought KV-4 to a 1v1. Poor decision.   I used RU251, and offered to kick his ass again in the CDC."

Thus making your decision to have done it in the first place about as bad as him. Could have just avoided it or played a fair game tier for tier and won and still proven your point.

Yes, it has a quad core but its clock speed is just far too slow, and its a Celeron (Never, ever touch them). If you want to use it for WoT or anything that vaguely makes the processor work a lot then go and find something else with better components and possibly at a cheaper price.   Smaller PC companies are always worth checking out. I got mine from a small German manufacturer for £300 about 2 years ago. It contains a GTX 650, i3 with multithreading running at 3.3GhZ, as well as a 2 Tb hard drive. It certainly isn't amazing in modern day standards (lower-mid range), but for its cost it was certainly worth it. I can run WoT on high graphics with 100FPS too.  If you can survive with a desktop as well, I would certainly recommend one over a laptop. They are generally cheaper for the same performance as parts don't have to be designed and made for a certain model, don't over heat after a few years of use (unless maintained) and you can upgrade them with ease."

And I am not sure if there is a misunderstanding or if we agree or disagree. I am sure that you have clarified nor helped the discussion. I made my opinin very clear in the first post I made. Feel free to re-read it. This game is for you. Your stats are yours. You choose what you feel comfortable with in terms of risk when stealing kills or holding shots. A good player likely makes this descision better than most. When a good player steals kills, they know the game is sealed or know there is no big disadvantage to stealing a kill. This isnt the game hampering flop you explain it to be by using the most extreme examples in your comment.  I asked if this was a sensitive issue because you said ""fuck off"". That tends to be something someone says when they are angry. It is not the best way to have a discussion. I also do not think what I said warranted such a response.   I guess context is hard for some people. That response was not written in anger at all. I dont even see angry undertones. Perhaps swearing for you indicates anger, but it can also indicate other things like emphasis, which is what it was used for here for example.   Your last point about good players doing it sometimes is fine. There is no need to say I live in a fairytale world though.   Well then there is no need to use extremes all the time to argue about a point as that just gets rid of any nuance or fine details and deals in absolutes.   If we can proceed without this, I would like to know the logic of a medium hold its shot. Do you mean when it is spotting, holdings its shot because they will get lit?   Nope. Heres a scenario. I am doing well, I have 5 kills, there are many people left on my team, much time left on the clock and a full health heavy enemy tank. I want that top gun. Il take it over maybe getting one extra shot in. That is the type of trade off Im referring to. Il steal that kill because shiny top gun medals are nice. Il hold my shot maybe a second too long or plan out my shots so that I am the most likely to get a kill. If this means one of my team mates dies to them, then its their fault for going in with that little hitpoints.    I think its very reasonable to make descisions like this. You are no longer working towards a common goal and you are no longer a team. There is no pot of gold and there are no winnings you all receive.

WorldofTanks,3dq8uo,Shuffletron,4,Sat Jul 18 12:06:55 2015 UTC,What makes the IS-7 better?
WorldofTanks,3dq8uo,Shuffletron,10,Sat Jul 18 12:12:27 2015 UTC,"The speed, armour and alpha make it one of the most popular tier 10 heavies (especially in close range) and is a staple of every CW team. It excels at brute forcing its way through enemy lines then using its relatively good speed to help with end game clean up.  The 113 on the other hand is a tank you want to love, its a heavy medium, its mobile and has great gun handling whilst still having somewhat usable armour. The problem with it is that it has no gun depression at all and it is not quite fast enough to poke, fire and retreat like a medium, this means that finding areas to make it work is a challenge. Also the standard pen is shit, like E100 levels of shit."
WorldofTanks,3dq8uo,Ilktye,2,Sat Jul 18 13:26:02 2015 UTC,"It excels at brute forcing its way through enemy lines   If the enemies are complete pancakes, sure. Otherwise everyone will shoot your lower front plate all day long. Or you get tracked and artied and/or tier 10 TD'ed. Or you get clipped by a tier 9-10 autoloader, which you have time to shoot once.  Successful IS-7 playing is more like tactical advancing through enemy lines. You cannot really brute force anything,  but you can enable your team to do so: You will win by gaining ground which allows your team mates to shoot the enemy.  If you charge a flank head first in IS-7, it will nearly always end up with you going to garage very fast. Just like with every other tank in the game. You just don't have the DPM to fight multiple enemies. Imagine a fight between T57 heavy and IS-7. T57 heavy will first clip you with 1600 damage... and then clip you again 20 second later with another 1600 damage and then he has HEAT reloaded. GG well played.   using its relatively good speed to help with end game clean up   It's still way too slow and mediums do nearly always the endgame clean up.  IS-7 is still a great tank."
WorldofTanks,3dq8uo,OrangeDreamed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"I could swear that the 113 uses the exact same gun as the 121, which has something like 250~ mm of pen on AP rounds. Which is DAMN good considering the normalization. It just suffers from massively shit DPM."
WorldofTanks,3dq8uo,Metallicpoop,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:38:04 2015 UTC,"What are you even saying? 113 has 249 pen, which is the same gun as the wz-120. And it fires 5.5 rpm, which is higher dpm than the e5."
WorldofTanks,3dq8uo,OrangeDreamed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:09:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the 113 is a t10 isn't it? You can't compare a fucking t10 heavy to a t9 medium. The DPM is higher by a AMAZING 20 points of damage, assuming you can work around your shitty gun depression (t110e5 has the lower dpm, but the higher pen). The flexibility of your tank affects your DPM as well, the DPM of a tank with 8 degrees of gun depression stays around that DPM in more areas than one with 3. But the point was that the pen of the 113 is not the problem. (Also, I never realised the 113 used the Wz-120's gun, 249 pen with AP is still nothing to laugh at. The 235 on the e100 is deplorable though.)"

One of the most well armored tanks in the game, surprisingly nimble, high alpha (yet inaccurate) gun.  Before tier 10 it's a much closer comparison, the IS-2 is as good if not better than the IS, the 110 is a great tank and the comparison between it and the IS-3 is personal preference (although I think most would choose the IS-3), and the WZ-111 1-4 is probably a better tank than the the IS-8, although that's also personal preference."

WorldofTanks,3dq8uo,V_Epsilon,2,Sat Jul 18 13:25:21 2015 UTC,"The IS line is better at every tier except the tier 7 maybe (though the IS is still ridiculously good), and at tier 9 (the WZ 111 1-4 is arguably the best tier 9 heavy with excellent armour, speed, and a great gun). The IS-7 is certainly a better tier 10 by far:  IS-7 has a ridiculously good UFP, invincible turret, a lower plate that can bounce E 100's all day long, magic side armour that can reach over 700mm because Russia, combined with excellent speed considering all the armour you have, a gun that is highly capable, especially after recent buffs, etc. the only disadvantage I can think of is the poor hull traverse speed, apart from that it's pretty damn OP. Even when firing on the side and rear of the IS-7's turret it can pull off some crazy bounces in a fair few parts because of the rounding.  The 113 has 250mm of effective UFP armour that's lowered even further by anything taller than it (i.e. pretty much anything), 2 fairly prominent cupolas (though they can be fairly troll with the rounding, they're weakspots none the less), a paper thin lower plate, a great turret frontally but the sides and rear won't provide any stupid bounces like the IS-7's does, the gun isn't as punchy as the IS-7's due to the lower alpha, the side armour is normal and won't go up to nearly a meter of armour on the sides like the IS-7's does (yeah, I know, it's meant to be the diamond shaped armour behind the 30mm of spaced armour on the sides but that spaced armour on the side isn't 30mm IRL, it's like 5mm maximum). The 113 simply loses to the IS-7 in every way except mobility which is significantly better, and better gun performance and DPM with the sacrifice of lower alpha damage and those 2 advantages are nowhere near enough to justify it over the IS-7."

WorldofTanks,3dq8uo,WeaponsGradeHumanity,2,Sun Jul 19 15:48:59 2015 UTC,"I've put a lot of games into my IS-2 and my 110.  I am just starting to get into the Russian heavies but am only at the KV-1S right now.  I'd just like to add a few comments that the IS-2 and 110 are both really fun tanks to play but with a few caveats.  First, the gun depression is bad but because poor gun depression is basically a staple of the Chinese line, at this point you're pretty used to it so I hope you have adjusted your playstyle by now.  The trick with the IS-2 is that it's really a fat medium.  It's pretty nimble for a heavy and even kind of quick but that movement can get you into trouble easily because the armour isn't very strong.  Even as top tier you'll run into a lot of trouble with TDs and other heavies easily penning your roughly 90mm armour.  Your top turret isn't even as well armoured as the T-34-1 Chinese medium.  You'll be in an unusual situation where your team will want you to push more because you're a heavy but at the same time, you can't really take the same punishment as other heavies.  The IS-2 guns also handle pretty poorly with a large dispersion and long aim times.  So you'll be in the tough situation of wanting to get closer to pound the enemy but can't really handle being up close.  But still, slamming a 390 alpha shell into the bad guys (when it pens) is pretty sweet.    When I finally unlocked the XP to move to the 110 I was very excited because I had seen a lot of videos showcasing it's very bouncy front.  But you will have to be careful not to expose your sides at all and you have to get used to NOT angling your front plate against the enemy.  I was way too aggressive in my early 110 days and got blown up fast.  The 122mm D-25T also starts to feel pretty weak ass against Tier 8-10, especially given how inaccurate it is.  The 110 retains the nice quickness and mobility (for a heavy) that the IS-2 did.  I often arrive in the front lines faster than my heavy peers - which can be trouble of course.  The 110 didn't start to shine for me though until I unlocked the top gun.  The 100mm 62-100T gun is much better and makes you a much bigger threat.  I've started to hit my stride with the 110 now and really enjoy it.  I'm also bouncing an average of 850 damage with it and doing much better on the damage side with the top gun.  So to sum up, I would say that the IS-2 (and 110) are really fun tanks to play but you just need to get used to them!"
WorldofTanks,3dq8uo,willyoung1999,2,Sun Jul 19 05:18:38 2015 UTC,"Well the IS-2 has pretty good heat, and apparently it is more bouncy than the IS. (Correct me if i'm wrong). Also, the 110 is pretty nice.. Not to mention, the WZ is pretty much the best tier 9 heavy IMO."
WorldofTanks,3dq8uo,WeaponsGradeHumanity,2,Sat Jul 18 11:57:39 2015 UTC,and apparently it is more bouncy than the IS     The frontal armour of the IS-2 is a much better shape for deflecting shots.

You can one-shot it by firing HE into the lower glacis using the M40/43's 155.

The first one is smart, it keeps you in the game longer and allows you to participate longer. The second one is just a statpadding dick move, these people generally have really good WN8 but very low win rate so they are easy to spot. The vast majority of players be it unicum, smurf, green or tomato (yes even the tomatoes sometimes red line camp at the back all game) do not do this."

You dont become a smurf if you arent playing for a win. Im sure what youre experiencing here is confirmation bias with some amount of misunderstanding.  Specifically talking about the free flanks part, thats perfectly reasonable. Never go to  an under supported flank. All that ends up happening is you die fast, ineffectively and bitter. If youre team lemmings, turn that into a steam roll by leading the charge and leaving the base empty. Its much better than being ineffective on one side and having the strong side stall to a weaker force."

Win rate probably doesn't suffer that much by playing passive and you can farm an incredible amount of damage. ""World of Tanks"" becomes ""World of WN8 at all costs"" for some."

WorldofTanks,3dp414,shiftyjamo,2,Sat Jul 18 03:46:13 2015 UTC,Aslain's mod pack has an option to download clan icons.  Choose that option they get downloaded to:  C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\res_mods\mods\shared_resources\xvm\res\clanicons\  Here's a copy of the NA icons.  Maybe someone from one of the other servers can post icons?
WorldofTanks,3dp414,Grogdor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:07:32 2015 UTC,"Oh, I read it again and get what you're trying to do now... there's also a method to get the top rated clans if that would help:  https://na.wargaming.net/developers/api_reference/wot/clanratings/top/  This is all for NA, just needs different URL for other clusters. I can help you whip something up, just not sure how the output would need to be formatted as I've never flair'ed a subreddit..."
WorldofTanks,3dp414,IKabobI,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:04:48 2015 UTC,Do they need to be a specific resolution?  Try these (although that's just NA).   Or download them from Aslain's installer and the pull them from the folder.
WorldofTanks,3dp414,Thyrotoxic,0,Sat Jul 18 03:06:43 2015 UTC,Having a quick google looks like they only have NA icons atm. Aslains seems like a good idea though.

WorldofTanks,3doe0b,_taugrim_,7,Fri Jul 17 22:40:32 2015 UTC,"Too much.  I've spent more on a ""free to play"" game than I have on ANY other in my 30 years of gaming."
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,Rhoobarb2002,3,Sat Jul 18 07:06:39 2015 UTC,"I have been playing WOT for about 6 months now, logging about 4400 battles.  My highest tank is the 110 and I dabble with a bunch of tanks from Tier 4-7 otherwise.  I am not in a clan and have only ever played random public matches.  I haven't spent any money on WOT although did get the promo gold a few weeks ago where it was about 30 gold per day for a few weeks.  There have been a few instances where the grind was so bad I contemplated dropping some money on gold to convert XP.  Plus, I've logged a lot of hours in WOT and have enjoyed it enough that I feel like I want to pay the devs a bit.    But then my generally cheap nature stops me from spending any money and subbing to Armored Warfare makes me wonder if I'll switch (this usually happens when I get one-shotted by arty), so that affects my decision too.    I also wish I could bank premium time instead of being forced to use it right away.  I generally don't have the time to power-game through a weekend warrior bundle or something like that."
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,PIngp0NGMW,2,Sat Jul 18 06:02:42 2015 UTC,I also wish I could bank premium time instead of being forced to use it right away   This. Sooooo much.
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,L4HA,2,Sat Jul 18 20:37:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I find that the only reasonable thing to do is to get a minimum of month at a time. That way you don't ever get that feeling ""i bought prem for the weekend so i just HAVE to play eventhough i dont really want to...""."

WorldofTanks,3doe0b,willyoung1999,2,Sat Jul 18 11:58:41 2015 UTC,Try matchup melee. You might get gold without even showing up.

WorldofTanks,3doe0b,CPTObvious08,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:25:33 2015 UTC,Almost. Not all ;)
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,willyoung1999,3,Sun Jul 19 11:33:08 2015 UTC,"I used to be a $0 person before I was employed and had time for tourneys and skirmishes. Nowadays I'd say I spend ~$35-50 a month. Mainly because I feel this game, even as flawed as it is, entertains me it deserves something with it. I can justify spending the cost of a new game on this a month if it means development and keeping the servers up and running."
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,Tsundere_Tanker,3,Sat Jul 18 02:36:59 2015 UTC,"Mainly because I feel this game, even as flawed as it is, entertains me it deserves something with it   I feel the same way.  WoT has warts, but so does every MMO, and I enjoy driving tanks and the high skill cap."
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,bbluech,3,Sat Jul 18 02:55:23 2015 UTC,I used to spend like $15 for prem each month. Now with tournaments I'm drowning in so much gold I don't know what to do with it.
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,KptKrondog,2,Sat Jul 18 06:22:50 2015 UTC,"Same.  The last time I used money to buy something in WoT was probably around July or August last year. I bought enough gold to get 6 months premium (I had some already from CW), and then started doing tourneys in Jan. Now I have 17,000 gold and all the premium tanks I care to have.  If you're spending money on this game, you're doing it wrong. Just go to the tourney section of the forums and look for a team that's missing players in the ""looking for team"" thread posted for each tourney. Make it to the Alpha bracket and it's 3k gold without winning a single battle. Bravo is like 1k gold. Also make sure to participate in any contests they do in the ""Contests!"" section, as it's usually no more than posting a SS to get entered. I've won 4-5k gold from those as well."
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,Piecejr,5,Sat Jul 18 06:48:32 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, if its really that easy that sounds like it would be fun (and way better than buying gold). What kinds of tanks would you need for these tournaments?"
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,KptKrondog,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:10:45 2015 UTC,Depends on the tourney
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,bbluech,2,Sat Jul 18 16:33:48 2015 UTC,Psh you poor peasant only 17k? That's like not even enough to buy all the premium tanks...
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,KptKrondog,3,Sat Jul 18 07:04:40 2015 UTC,"Not really many left to buy that I care about.  t54 mod 1 sometime maybe, that's about it. I bought the Conway today, it's the last tier 9 I have left to grind before I have all the tier 10's except for a few arty. In another couple months I will be done with all of the real tanks and I'll just have arty left and whatever they introduce next...not much incentive to buy any premium tanks tbh."
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,willyoung1999,3,Sat Jul 18 07:21:09 2015 UTC,"If only there was an option for ""far too much"".."
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,Xo0om,3,Sat Jul 18 11:58:23 2015 UTC,"$20-40 for me depending, but have spent more.  Not even close to what I spend on cable TV, and I spend more time playing than watching the tube.    Will buy a nice gold pack on occasion when they're on sale.  I often free XP past troublesome modules, buy camo (on sale), full skills on commander and sometimes gunner on new tanks.   Bought a couple of premiums - SU100Y, CDC, FCM50t.    Have a good job and few debts so I can afford it.  This is my hobby these days so I don't mind spending the bucks for something I enjoy.  Birthday coming up so I may treat myself to another gold pack if I like the price."

WorldofTanks,3doe0b,oinkbane,8,Fri Jul 17 23:54:41 2015 UTC,"tournaments on the NA server practically throw gold at the players, it's very different to EU"
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,willyoung1999,3,Sat Jul 18 05:22:47 2015 UTC,"Yup, EU tourneys suck dick because you actually have to be decent to win anything. I'm not saying that you don't have to be good to win in NA, but its a lot easier than in the EU.."
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,backjacker,2,Sat Jul 18 11:59:25 2015 UTC,"There's two stages. Group stage is first, performance here determines which of the two branches of the playoffs (second stage) you qualify into. You get a certain amount of gold (depending on which playoff you qualified into) for getting into playoffs (only top 50%). Then your performance in playoffs determine how much additional gold on top of your qualification bonus you get.  As long as your team can play well, it's not hard to make decent gold. It's not uncommon to see average-green teams to make it into the top 25, and it's really not that difficult to make it into the top 50 if your team is average-green."
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,dnuljrelyt,3,Sat Jul 18 02:08:22 2015 UTC,"How much of a time commitment are these tournaments? I'm not available to enter now, but I'm curious as to how long it takes to go through those stages."
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,backjacker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:08:05 2015 UTC,"It's mon,tues,wed, and then at least friday, and then saturday and/or sunday depending on your playoff performance.  Everyday starts at 10pm eastern time, and usually goes for about an hour and a half for the group stage, and then usually under an hour for the playoffs."

WorldofTanks,3doe0b,backjacker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:46:00 2015 UTC,"But there's reserve players, so say that each match is a 4v4, the team will consist of 7 players, with 3 in reserve. So you don't have to be available every single night."
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,That_Unknown_Guy,0,Sun Jul 19 01:56:17 2015 UTC,"Well, Recent wise I guess I qualify and I qualify wn8 wise, but I dont think its only for the 1%ers. Get into a clan that does tourneys or seek out a decent tourney team and being half decent almost guarantees you 3k gold in a week. I just recently started and ive won about 10k in the past month.  If you are in the top 25 percent for skirmishes for example, thats almost a garunteed 3k gold. Win the first round and thats 4500 and it goes up to 10k."
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,dswartze,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:28:24 2015 UTC,"I was debating whether to put two options for $0 USD:   $0 USD $0 USD, because I get gold from tourneys, CW, etc   Decided for simplicity not to do that though.  There was also the potential problem of double-counting gifts, given that there are or may be people on this Reddit that other people give gold to."
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,SeKomentaja,2,Fri Jul 17 22:52:17 2015 UTC,"For clarity, spending includes all of the following   money you spend for your account money you spend on gifts for others (e.g. your favorite streamers / YouTubers)   For the sake of consistency for the poll   don't include non-WoT gifts such as monetary donations you make directly to players who stream, because that money doesn't go to Wargaming   EDIT 1: re-created the poll to get rid of gifts received, as that would be double-counting in some cases  EDIT 2: part of the reason I ask is I'm curious what the APRU (Avg Revenue Per User) is for folks who see this poll. SuperData Research published a report just over a year ago that found the ARPU for WoT was $4.51 USD"
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,eperb12,2,Fri Jul 17 22:42:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not opposed to spending money on the game, and in fact feel like for the time I put into it they probably deserve some more, but I earn enough through clan wars that there's nothing I want badly enough to spend actual money so it's probably been at least a year since I spent anything on the game."

WorldofTanks,3doe0b,boucem,2,Sat Jul 18 11:47:48 2015 UTC,"Played ~7-12 tournaments, still have 25k in the bank waiting for some Tier 8 discounts to roll around so I can buy an FCM and something else.  It's nice, I've gotten maybe average 3-6k gold every time? I did buy the KV-5 and a 12k gold package sometime back in mid year 2013 though, that's the last time I bought something from Wargaming."

WorldofTanks,3doe0b,GotYouByTheBalls,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:05:44 2015 UTC,"Well, I asked for average per month, so as long as you've been playing.  Take the total spent over that time, divide by number of months."
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,GotYouByTheBalls,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:31:36 2015 UTC,"It's just that it might not be very representative if you spent a few hundred 3 years ago when you just started playing, and now don't pay a dime for over a year or so."
WorldofTanks,3doe0b,Mrdirtbiker140,2,Sat Jul 18 17:04:43 2015 UTC,"You used be able to block clans from attacking by filling up your defense slots with battles with friendly clans then having no one show up then a draw didn't cost you any cubes. This is the same thing that clans do in clan wars, but the top clans all cried about not being able to rape lesser clans for their cubes, so this no longer works. My clan had our buildings at level 10, we smashed then all and stopped doing anything with strongholds."

I would have guessed that more than half the players who regularly visit this sub-Reddit and dialogue about the game are willing to spend money on it.  I've never done CW nor tourneys. Used to do a ton of organized PVP in other games (Arena, World PVP raids, etc), but these days I enjoy the flexibility of just running random battles."

Recently, the clan broke apart and decided to get my stats up a bit before joining another one, but I don't even know if I want to anymore.  I mean, I play when I want, with who I want, any time of day. I can take a week break and come back with no consequences.   Being clanless is fun. I do miss stat padding and serious carrying with other purples on top of gold payouts and such sometimes, but such is life.  I'd rather come home from work have a nice cold beverage and mess around with my friends than getting on an hour before clan wars, doing training, waiting another 15 minutes for it to start, rinse and repeat for upwards of 4 hours."

WorldofTanks,3dm7ms,jesta030,6,Sat Jul 18 15:44:24 2015 UTC,"1 - arty. Sucks to play, sucks to play against. 2 - Performance. Even after 9.9 (in which I saw a gain), the performance is still terrible. 3 - extreme penetration values. Gold pen in many cases, and TD silver pen in some cases simply obsoletes (most) armour. Let you make worse shots or shots against higher tiers? Yes. Let you blast through the front of almost anything? Too much. 4 - Unclear policies and random bans. EU especially is now threatening a massive 'illegal mods' ban wave, but won't tell anyone what constitutes an illegal mod. A number of streamers (as well as a number of clanmates and personal friends) have been banned for random shit - a friend of mine spammed his M44 for a few days doing missions, and took a 24 hour ban for 'unsportsmanlike conduct', despite doing nothing that would support this (at least, so he says, and I trust his opinion on the matter..) 5 - Missions. Seriously. The extreme random involved in some of the personal missions kills me motivation to play. I want to progress in them, but when I have essentially no control, I just get frustrated. Multiple fires in one game? Full random. Spot x000 damage? completely map and team dependant. Splash x? RNG because artillery. Just frustrating."
WorldofTanks,3dm7ms,Ghesthar,9,Fri Jul 17 15:37:19 2015 UTC,"+-2 tier MM, remove it, at least in low tiers (1-6). It scares a fuckton of new players away. But the whole idea of ""you need to get fucked by MM from time to time to be able to appreciate being top tier"" is retarded.  Arty. Just add a delay so they can't fire for a few seconds after moving their guns. No more hitting targets on the move, no more shotgunning. They can still do what they're supposed to do, shoot campers who sit stationary for half a minute. Are they useless? Good, it means nobody's camping. Map designs that forces TDs to camp, and wait for a flank to collapse. Then they can rape the tanks trying to dig them out. It's just dumb. Balance.  RNG spread."
WorldofTanks,3dm7ms,dartonite,6,Fri Jul 17 14:15:44 2015 UTC,"On the topic of +-2 MM, when I first started playing I was on the brink of completely uninstalling because of this.  Getting past tier III and IV was goddamn impossible for me, getting one shot almost every time.  In my opinion, the +-2 MM is one of the worst problems with the game.  It's not as big of a problem in higher tier games, but definitely still an issue that needs to be fixed.  On the top of artillery, you're very wrong in my opinion.  Artillery would be completely useless.  Maybe this is what you're going for because you dislike arty, but I feel like this is not the correct approach to this.  In order to avoid artillery, you would simply need to move back a couple meters.  What makes you think campers wouldn't just get smart and move a little bit every time they're spotted?"
WorldofTanks,3dm7ms,iYokay,8,Fri Jul 17 20:19:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, i dislike arty, and in my opinion they shouldn't be in the game, because there's no need for them.  (inb4 ""you don't play arty"" i actually do, and ~15% of my games are in SPGs.)  First of all, they can't do, and never will be able to do what they're ""supposed"" to do: kill campers.   Campers sit in one place , and wait for the enemy to drive in front of their guns. Arty can't do anything against them,until their whole team is dead, because they don't get spotted.  Second, there's  no need for a class in the game to kill campers. Brawling heavy tanks are not camping. If a heavy is locking down a position, and your tank can't fight it, don't drive in front of him. If he has nothing to shoot at, and he's not moving, he's screwing his team over by not doing something useful. You can force him to choose between being useless, or giving up his position.  Campers lose, because they give up map control,let their team die, and eventually get surrounded, and killed. If a team can't win with complete map control, and are dumb enough to get slaughetered by campers,  they don't deserve to win, simple as that.    In order to avoid artillery, you would simply need to move back a couple meters. What makes you think campers wouldn't just get smart and move a little bit every time they're spotted?   There's already a delay, because of the shell travel time. Wiggling back and forth doesn't do anything if the  arty has any idea what he's doing, because it's predictable. Having a 2-3 second delay  after gun movement would make next to no difference if the enemy is moving predictably.  If campers would get smart, they would realize that camping sucks, and the reason they have a   45% WR is because they aren't doing jack shit, and not because ""they always get noob teams tm"", and they would stop camping. Artillery in it's current form only taught these players that they won't get artied if they don't leave base.  Third, the whole concept of arty ""making the gameplay more dynamic"" by keeping people moving, is so fucking dumb, it's not even funny.  Let's say im poking a ridge in a medium. If there's no arty, i can poke pretty much on reload, maybe try to bait out shot, and kill the enemy if i outplay him. If there's arty, i have to pull back after every shot, wait for the spot to drop, while moving around like a drunk, headless chicken, or sit behind hardcover to have a chance to not get clicked. Then take an other shot, and reposition. Because eventually arty will get lucky. If you're in a heavy and relocating isn't an option, it's even worse.  Arty makes a 30 second  engagement take  minutes, because you have to waste time sitting behind cover/running around like a retard to avoid getting clicked.   So artillery doesn't make gameplay more dinamic, and there's no need for a class in the game to ""prevent camping"" because camping is only a problem if it's your team doing it. It's a ""solution"" for a ""problem"" that doesn't even exist.  In my opinion Wargaming's intention with arty was to ""teach"" players how to play, that camping is bad, and if you can, you should push your advantage. Problem is, if someone is uncapable or unwilling to learning  by trial and error over thousands of battles, it's just hopeless. If someone doesn't want help, forcing it won't work. If they want to help the players so bad, add useful loading screen tips, make quality guides and tutorials instead of ""E-100 stronk tenk, remember to press 2 to win"".  We all know removing arty isn't an option. Rework them, so they can do their ""job"" (which is once again unnecessary, and regular tanks can do it better, since arty can't spot the campers, and artillery can't shoot campers that are in arty shadow), and nothing more. Because if they can do more, it just fucks the whole game.  TL;DR: Arty serves no purpose, and since removing it isn't an option, just gut it. Rework it so it can't hit anything that's moving, or making an effort to avoid getting hit. Then it will be working as intended  Edit: Tinfoil hat time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQoRXhS7vlU Is WG  making maps that force TDs to camp base, so artillery has a purpose to be in the game?"

I'd tone it down to 15% or even 10%.  3) Scout tanks are basically mini mediums with worse MM, they should be just as different from mediums as heavies are IMO.  4) Map design. All city or all open maps are bad for gameplay, every map should allow lights, mediums, heavies, and TDs to all do well, but no one class should have a dominant effect on the match, such as a team with lots of mediums from north spawn mines.  5) The playerbase. I have no problem with people being incompetent, but the sheer amount of malice people can throw out is a bit offputting."

You have no chance to penetrate those tanks even with gold ammo. Only thing you can do is to literally go behind a KV1 and shoot gold to its rear. Would that happen if you played any tier 8 tank against tier 10?
WorldofTanks,3dm7ms,h3xi_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:15:36 2015 UTC,"I don't mind it that much as long as my tank is upgraded. Most stock t8s are just screwed. Unless you meet TDs, you actually have a decent amount of hitpoints. An IS-7 needs 4 average shots to kill an IS-3 which gives you ~30 seconds to find cover. T4 vs T6 feels much more punishing to me. An KV-85 will pretty much 2 shot every T4 in roughly 6 seconds."
WorldofTanks,3dm7ms,InsaneShepherd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:14:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Tier 8 is manageable but you're still at the mercy at your team if you want to win. Most (maxed out) tier 8s can hold a candle and support from the rear though and do well enough."

No point in having a ""scout"" 3 tiers down, where basically, the meds at that tier have better view range.  3- The current meta. It should be different. Corridors everywhere, or open maps (looking at you, arty).  4- RNG. Too much RNG. It's frustrating to shoot a 20pdr (230 av damage) at a guy with 200 HP, and deal 175 instead.  5- Balancing of some tanks. Caernarvon, Centurion I for example come to mind. How does a tier 6 HT (KV-85) with a 100mm gun, fires faster than tier 8 tanks with an 82mm? It's ridiculous. Sure, it has good handling, good accuracy, but still. The reload time for the damage you deal is bloody ridiculous. Also, ammo racks and insta-engine fires are also stupid. Eg. the caernarvon has the frontal left armor made of ammo. I once got hit from behind on my front left sprocket, which by the round's trajectory would never hit the hull, and I got ammo racked.  If you fix these small things, WG, you'll get one hell of a game  PS: game optimization too. No multi-core support is stupid"

I would also be curious, if given the choice, how many players would turn off arty for matches. Personally it fills me with joy when I dont see any.   +- 25% RNG of penetration is a little silly but I sort of see why its there. It is possibly there to simulate random chance the round hit something on the tank that prevented it from penning the armor. (think of all the crap on the outside of a tank).  EDIT - GRAMMARS"
WorldofTanks,3dm7ms,SoMeDuDe904,0,Fri Jul 17 14:56:28 2015 UTC,"The rng spread for pen values is due to the variability in the quality of the individual tank rounds.

Putting them in higher tier games solves both issues.  If WG really wanted to, they could probably fix it, so lights were like more mobile, undergunned mediums that get bonus XP for spotting, but there's no real reason to, other than ""it might be confusing for new players"", and it would require to rebalance the whole class.

I mean, I mentioned dodging above and even you admit here that there's something you can do in a worst case scenario.  For instance, if you pay attention to when artillery fires then you can time your actions accordingly.  You can move when he's firing at someone else. You can bait shots to make him miss.  Heck, if you can destroy the enemy fast enough then you can limit the damage artillery does through the sheer brevity of the round.  There're also strategic options like pushing a flank to force artillery to relocate.     Yes, tanks have ""worst case scenarios"", but you said ""People mostly just don't care to learn how to play against it"". I know how to play against arty but still struggle.

If there's an arty problem that needs solving then I'd say it's a matter of education rather than an issue with the class itself.  I'm not sure how you're measuring 'better' here but I think I'd rather have an arty-heavy game than an arty-light game because you get a lot more freedom to move around the map when you know there isn't a big-ass TD hiding behind every bush.  I'm pretty good at not getting hit by SPGs so having more of them doesn't bother me.     After all, this is a game and most people agree it isn't fun to play against arty.     Most vocal people.

WorldofTanks,3dm7ms,Fuckanator,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:09:22 2015 UTC,That's the exact wrong thing to do.
WorldofTanks,3dm7ms,WeaponsGradeHumanity,2,Fri Jul 17 18:42:55 2015 UTC,"Arty: It is a broken mechanic that is too reliant on RNG, hits too hard, and messes up the meta. It encourages camping by heavy tanks and slows down games.  RNG: You want randomness in a game, but I think the stated 20% spread is too high. 15% is a better number, 10% would lead more to skill rather then luck. Rolling 600 versus 900 on an E-100 shell is insanity.  Optimization: This game runs terribly. I realize that Russian is their #1 target, but with the split of SD and HD clients they need to make the game run better top to bottom. On top of that, buuuuuuuuuugs. Ghost shells are silly.  Maps: Serb doesn't understand corridors. We want flanking opportunities and options. Hidden Valley, Pearl River, Mines...these maps literally give you 2-3 choices and nothing else. Himmelsdorf/Ensk have multiple approaches across the map with flanks all over the place. Overlord is good, do more of that.  Premium ammo: I get it, they are a good gold/credit sink, but they are bad for the game. Take a hint from AW and turn ammo into a strategic choice. HEAT does more damage but lower pen. APCR pens more but hits less. Do that!"

WorldofTanks,3dm7ms,trobsmonkey,2,Fri Jul 17 18:10:17 2015 UTC,"Artillery: In it's current state, artillery only adds frustration to the WoT meta, both for its users and victims. Artillery is a mechanic that places too much of its possible effectiveness on RNG rather than skill. Gold Round Usage: When first implemented into the game, gold rounds were scarce and those who could afford them could only afford to use them only when absolutely necessary (for the most part). Today, I believe gold rounds are now too accessible; they are now used more often as a crutch when the player does not have the skill or effort to consistently penetrate higher armored targets.  ±2 Matchmaker In Mid-Tier Matches: In battles of tier 1-3, and 8-10, I believe the differences in performance between tanks is suitable for the right balance between challenging and enjoyable game play. Between tiers 4-7 however, I don't believe this is the case. In the mid-game, World of Tanks becomes much more of a grind than an enjoyable experience. 25% RNG: RNG variances in damage and penetration due lead to more interesting unpredictable gameplay, but I believe 25% is too high for at least the penetration mechanic. Illegal Mod Usage: Although the usage of illegal mods is not widespread (at least on the North American servers), it is obvious that Wargaming has not done enough to classify and enforce the rules surrounding illegal modifications."
WorldofTanks,3dm7ms,Chicken13312,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:24:39 2015 UTC,"I feel the essential problem for gold round usage, rather than availablilty, is that it simply is a better round. Aside from costs, there is very little drawbacks to using it.   I'm ok with having say, a higher pen round, but to have that round simply be better is the actual problem. I feel premium ammo should become a more ""standard"" ammo, but have lower damage to compensate.

WorldofTanks,3dm7ms,unikum71,2,Sat Jul 18 01:32:23 2015 UTC,"1. Penetration RNG. To my knowledge it has the same +/- 25% spread as the damage. However, you don't know if you have a good or bad penetration. Sometimes you bounce off the side of tanks and you won't know if the angle is too steep or if the RNG just screwed you. At least you see a number when you roll for min damage.  2. Light tanks balancing. I think their balancing is horrible. Why is a t8 light tank t8 and not t9 if it gets the mm of a t9 tank? All this weird placement does is to make lights extremely dominating in tier 6-8 cw/e-sports. Moreover, t8 lights are bad t9 meds on most maps.  3.Stats tracking. Patchday is the best day to play for me because no one has xvm. Playing tanks can be so much fun. Especially in combination with arty stat sniping is an easy way to ruin the game for a group of players.  4. Arty mechanics. We don't need oneshots. I think going to a high rof and low damage arty model like in AW would be weird in WOT. Realism shouldn't be first, but a T92 with a 240mm gun that fires every ~15s sounds ridiculous to me. Not allowing arty shells to penetrate and tweak damage and splash would go a long way imo.  5. gold rounds. At least balance the existing gold rounds. Especially the  American 90mm guns get absolutely ridiculous APCR rounds with +50% penetration. WTF WG. Just create an ""ammunition bonus."" APCR could be +10% pen compared to AP and create a disadvantage for using APCR as well. HEAT could be +20% pen, but no normalisation and bad against spaced armor.  In general, WG should learn to balance step by step imo. Sometimes an immediate small step is worth a lot more than a big balancing patch in 3 month. Additionally, they're always trying to fix a whole class at once, but sometimes that makes single vehicles completely unenjoyable.   One more thing: making the spotting system easier to understand and more intuitive could go a long way in keeping new players playing the game."
WorldofTanks,3dm7ms,InsaneShepherd,2,Fri Jul 17 14:52:47 2015 UTC,"RNG - the current RNG is just broken, it breaks artillery, its a little to much on damage roll, and randomly bouncing shots of tanks.

Artillery is meant to counter camping heavies who have a fantastic hull down position. Not be RNGesus dependent death machine. Gold ammo - whilst its possible to buy with silver, there are no downsides, pen should be traded for damage. This way it rewards skill (aim at weak spots? use normal ammo and pen, more damage than prem ammo). Penetration - Penetration needs a work, its a little too RNG based, it should reward skill. Those that take time to aim should get better results than clickers or gold spammers. MM - Two tiers is horrible at low tiers (KV-1 anyone?). The tiers should be balanced so that if you are a lower tier you can still kill a top tier tank, but have to flank it or shoot it in the rear. Introduce tactics. Scout matchmaking is also broken, + 3 tiers? Great, I can go sit in a non-existent bush and get REKT because even if I fire gold I do basically nothing.   Bonus: 6.

WorldofTanks,3dm7ms,learnyouahaskell,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:35:14 2015 UTC,"Arty, but more specifically how it plays. Far too accurate/too much damage. If it is going to be that accurate, make it a 65 second reload OR make it hit much softer. IMO it should be played as area denial, small amounts of damage, high module/crew crit chances, decent ROF. Spotting and view range. - I think each tank should have a visible cue range, half moon shaped with the direction of the turret being the longest view range point with it falling off as it goes toward the peripheral. And being less effective the further out it goes.  Camo - Camo should be applied as a negative to the above. For instance a tank with a VR of 500m can see ANYTHING within 300m and can see movement outwards of 500m. but a tank with a camo value of say...50 makes it so that that same tank must be within 250m to spot it. And once a tank is spotted, it stays lit until it is A. outside of all tanks view ranges. B. all tanks spotting it are dead. or C. they are dead.  Map rotation. It needs to feel much more random, i dislike getting Murovanka 10 times in a night, but never seeing Himmelsdorf. Armor vs shell type. I think there should be a re-searchable line of ammunition for each Gun. Give rounds more and more pen and damage as you research them, and the top rounds say....HESH, AP, and HE. all have strengths and weaknesses. ie. AP has high pen, moderage damage low crew kill, low module damage (unless direct hit). HESH has moderate pen and high damage. Moderate crew kill and module damage, and HE has low pen, High damage, high chances for module damage/crew kills This would make the brain-dead idea of ""spam yer golds"" disappear because we would no longer need it."

WorldofTanks,3dm7ms,shefsilenus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:31:54 2015 UTC,"1 Artillery (popular choice)    The two biggest problems I see with arty are that it's almost entirely RNG which isn't much of a gameplay mechanic, and that it's mostly boring to play because there's no real balanced interaction or defensive impetus until the end of the round when you're getting mowed down or mowing down their arty.  I think that they can take a lot of cues from AW's presentation from arty in terms of giving a vague idea of the arty's position on the minimap after it fires forcing a minimum of self preservation from arty players and allows the other team to know the direction they can expect arty to come from allowing them to make a better effort to defend themselves from it.  So rather than just sitting there and flinging, moving a little after every shot to prevent counterbattery, you'd have to move and think more and actually put some work in rather than just rngeezus the whole thing.  Jingles has a good video about this : https://youtu.be/fDY0w3CnjAM?t=706 Perhaps even a crew skill that can say if you're being targeted by arty, or a triangulation skill for the radio man to be able to point out a vague location of the arty when it fires.  also, a bit of a pullback on the damage and reload times would make it a better harasser and less of a rapist.    2  Gold shells    As a game mechanic I think it's garbage,  tanks should have trade offs to balance the things they can do well.  The t54 for example does just about everything well aside from gun depression and it should pay for that in it's penetration.  It should have to use the mobility and positioning to compensate for the lack of pen rather than be able to just brawl down ht's at their face by hiding the hull.    The one thing the heavy tank has in that situation is completely nullified in the time when it should be it's most valuable.  I really think it's a wretched game mechanic and makes the gameplay much less creative.    3  Interface, gui, controls    If I always have to put on a modpack to be able to change my zoom settings so that the mousewheel doesn't scroll me into sniper mode, just put it in the game.  There are a lot of little things that the mod community has made better in this game and it would be great if they were just integrated into the game.    4  MM    Sometimes MM will give a team 3-5 more higher tier tanks than the other time.  It doesn't happen often, but it really shouldn't happen at all.  I don't mind if the composition is slightly imbalanced in terms of types of tanks, but when the imbalance is in tiers and could easily be corrected by MM just moving some tanks over to the other team I don't understand how it happens.  Same thing for player rating, MM should be able to read player ratings and make quick, small adjustments to try to keep things slightly balanced skill wise.      5  The people    ""UNINSTALL YOU FUCKING RETARD"" etc..etc..etc.."

Less ammo to enable critical thinking, or an ""artillery in your sector"" warning, albeit with buffs to aim time would help.  As a bonus: Not a clear distinction between ""brawler"" and "" sniper"" guns. An 88/L71 should be substantially more accurate/faster aiming than a D-25T to offer some definition of tank roles, making it unviable to snipe in tanks that shouldn't, and vice versa.

Artillery makes certain TD's and Heavies unplayable (you feel like you're a Piñata) at higher tiers. Spotting Refresh Rate too slow, makes spotting medium-fast tanks really hit and miss, they can get across terrain and not be spotted till they're at the other side. Premium ammo makes armor obsolete causing the top tier medium tank w/gold ammo power creep. Removing premium ammo would make it easier to tune penetration values of each tank in a way which would promote healthy gameplay for each individual tank. The armor is Russian so it bounces anything and everything at random at every angle. Not looking at any IS-7 type tanks in particular. No but really 50% RNG on penetration makes penetration trollier than it should be. 50% damage RNG isn't too bad. Matchmaker being stupid and lop siding one team extremely (admittedly this has improved over the years but it happens still)   Honorable mention would be +-2 matchmaking but I'm mostly a higher tier player so it's not really that concerning to me personally."

I played a bit before you could buy it with silver, and it was rare and only sometimes used, now everyone uses it and it just makes every battle over quicker and really cuts down on how much you can learn when you die in one hit you can't stop even with angling your armor. I literally never deflect shots or stop them, pretty much everything hurts every time and it's discouraging, and for a new player trying to buy new tanks and components, it feels like such a waste to spend so much of your earnings on ammo, but if you don't, you are never going to be competitive. Assholes who start the match and run into you while you decide who you want to follow. I know it does no damage, but WTF, I'm stationary, how bad of a driver are you that you run into me literally seconds after the match starts. As a noob I like to see where everyone is going, and follow a group that I feel like I can offer support to. since I'm usually not in the biggest most well armed tank I want to hold back and try to track people and plink at who my teammates are shooting to keep the pressure on and help them out....and ramming me the moment the match starts just really adds to the warm fuzzy feeling of community we have here.

The top down view is just unrealistic for how artillery works, compared to how we have to long range shoot in tanks. They should work more like regular tanks, but with some windage and elevation ticks so you try to lob shots long range across the map towards enemy markers, not zoom right in with magical satellite view and pop people with crazy accuracy from across the map. Artillery are like Snipers in Battlefield, Nobody likes them except themselves, they never really contribute, they just camp and try to max out their kills. I realize them getting a ton of kills helps the team, but it should be more of a scout arty relationship somehow."

WorldofTanks,3dktw0,DrRedOrDead,3,Fri Jul 17 08:23:48 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  19k battles @ 5 minutes per battle = 1500 hrs play.

And it is the only game I now play. So I am not buying the latest game with DLC and season pass for £100 every few months.  Just because the game can be played for free, does not mean that money spent on it is wasted. WG is a company, they don't give us this game out of the goodness of their hearts.

WorldofTanks,3dlwji,trollwnb,23,Fri Jul 17 09:36:04 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard the best way to play this tank is to use the non autoloading gun, because it has better gun handling. Thu gun handling and DPM on the autoloader look terrible."
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,Dukkerz,6,Fri Jul 17 12:58:33 2015 UTC,"I've seen similar conclusions being made.   I personally will keep advertising the ""chinese style"" of scouting. Basically it goes like this: You choose a bush that has hardcover nearby from which you still can engage the enemy. Due to great mobility you should have no problems finding and getting to those locations. After that it's just a cast of: Fire, retreat to cover, wait for reload, move back into position and aim your next shot, rinse and repeat.  You kit your crew with Eagle Eye and Sixt sense (to know how long you are spotted and keep the enemies lit while you reload) and then just farm your dmg slowly, while not neglecting your scout job."
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,MrAFMB,5,Fri Jul 17 15:21:09 2015 UTC,Chinese light tanks are so much better with the 85mm IMO. The wz-131 in particular shines when you are just able to find the positions about 100m-200m to the left or right of your main force and hit the sides of distracted tanks. The DPM is insane!
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,bbluech,3,Fri Jul 17 18:32:10 2015 UTC,"I rather hated that, I tend to get shot when I do that and if you can't put in two shots in a row, because you have to get back to cover since they are turning to face you, you'd better use the 100mm and the Pen is really lacking on the 131s 85mm.  Personally I love my 100mm. But to each his own, do what works for you that's the beauty of that line, the choice of style with a very good chassis to work on! ;P"
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,MrAFMB,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:37:20 2015 UTC,"I play my 132 a lot and personally prefer the 100 for pubs just due to the pen, but you can do work in a tier 9 match or strongholds with the 85"
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,SFXBTPD,2,Sat Jul 18 03:36:47 2015 UTC,Great Mobility?  This thing has some of the worst mobility I've played on a LT.
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,megumino2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:36:33 2015 UTC,"It goes 60 everywhere.  SP1c rarely goes 58 places, 13-75 won't do top speed much either (1km/h more @61) T71 has the same top speed with less HP/t.  It is only beaten by the M41 and Lttb, but it beats the Lttb in gun handling and the M41 in gun performance (and both by miles in alpha if it wants the 100mm).  Basically what you just said was ""It's slower than my bulldog/Lttb - therefore it has bad mobility."""
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,MrAFMB,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:48:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you are pulling numbers out of your ass, but misguided info is misguided.   LTTB / T71 / M41 / 131 / SPIC / 1375  HP/Weight:  30.86 / 23.58 / 23.41 / 21.39 / 20.53 / 19.74  Turn:  48  /  56  /  56   /  52  /  44  /  40  Ground Resistance:  0.9  /  0.7  /  0.5  /  0.7  /  0.8  /  0.7  1.0  /  0.8  /  0.6  /  0.8  /  0.9  /  0.8  1.6  /  1.5  /  1.1  /  1.6  /  1.8  /  1.4  So really, T71 is doing fine, at least much better than the SPIC. What you can say however is that the SPIC performs similar to that of the 1375, with a tiny bit more HP/T and turn, but worse ground resistance. Let me tell you, I've played 1375 in the past, it's not a tank known to be mobile either (although the mobility improvement from 12t is felt when driving the 1375).  Edit: Just a side note, any gun handling advantage this tank's got over the other tier 7 scouts, will be negated by the fact that everyone else has shell velocity over 1000, and this guy only has 630, for both AP and HEAT. That's a HUGE difference."
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,megumino2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:18:42 2015 UTC,"You replied to a comment about the chinese tanks. 131(,132).  The SP1c IMO is a PoS, the 131 IMO is a goddess in tank form. I was referring to the 131 in my comment, since you said mobility is bad in a reply to my ""chinese style scouting"". It is to be noted that in my comment I actually said    SP1c rarely goes 58 places"
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,MrAFMB,0,Sat Jul 18 17:40:16 2015 UTC,"Last I played it was on the test server and the gun handling wasnt bad at all actually. Worse than single shot, but definitely no 1390 (as in not as bad)"

WorldofTanks,3dlwji,thespichopat,9,Fri Jul 17 10:29:54 2015 UTC,The acceleration is a big fault of this tank.
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,MrChalking,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:56:52 2015 UTC,"Acceleration is a bit lacking, but not that bad. I wish it had a slightly higher speed and definitely more armor, though it's small size makes it relatively hard to hit."
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,Grummond,9,Fri Jul 17 21:53:25 2015 UTC,The gun is really bad though. 3 seconds intraload on a 3 shot autoloader? And only 240 damage? A full clip potential of 720 hitpoints? You're gonna have a bad time.  Also it's too slow for a light tank. And the painfully slow turret?  I'm not getting aboard this particular hype train.
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,MrChalking,6,Fri Jul 17 11:17:11 2015 UTC,"the damage per minute is not much differnce than t71, its only 100differnce, and you get +90alpha.  Also remember in 1clip you deal 720damage. And that takes you 26seconds to load second clip. t71 takes 32 seconds to load second clip and deals 900damage. So basically you can already unload your second clip (takes 6seconds), while he is finishing his loading of second clip. in 32seconds you deal 1440 damage, while he deals only 900. Its all relative ofcourse."
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,MrAFMB,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:36:58 2015 UTC,"You can also put a gun rammer on the autoloader, which puts reload down to about 17 or 18 seconds with a near 100% crew."
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,Grummond,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:50:32 2015 UTC,I wouldn't value DPS so high on a light tank that has 15mm of armour at best.   And if I did the 131 has a great 85mm (2275dpm base) (compared to SP1c 1689 or 1862). With sweet soft stats and great camo & speed with it.
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,Upvotes_poo_comments,-3,Fri Jul 17 15:30:11 2015 UTC,"Sure, if you compare it to an obsolete tank it doesn't look nearly as bad. But don't compare it to an M41 Bulldog. It's going to be embarrasing for the Spähpanzer."
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,HaroldSax,11,Fri Jul 17 15:11:46 2015 UTC,"Don't compare anything to the Bulldog, because it's maybe the best tank in the game and completely OP.  That doesn't mean the SPIC isn't a workable, fun, tank."
WorldofTanks,3dlwji,Atermel,6,Fri Jul 17 15:26:25 2015 UTC,"I won't argue that the Bulldog is very, very good and probably OP, but it's hardly the best tank in the game."

WorldofTanks,3dlwji,samuraistrikemike,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:28:55 2015 UTC,"I would say that it doesn't actually exist, that is to say, there is no ""best tank"" in the game. There is maybe the best light, or the best medium, but the ""best tank"" doesn't seem like it can be pinpointed.  If I had to say a tank, it'd be a toss-up between the Object 140 and the T62A. I cannot think of a map where they're at a disadvantage in any way, so in the sense that those two tanks can be used effectively on any map, in almost any situation, they would be the best in that regard."

Exactly who should be pissed off about the state of SPGs in this scenario?  Edit:  He got drilled by a fucking BATCHAT '58 in the open. He doesn't bother using a repair kit, and the '58 still misses him 2 more times. Then, 25 seconds after the first hit, he gets nailed in the EXACT SAME SPOT.  This time he uses his repair kit... after waiting 5 seconds; then doesn't even bother moving! -- the third hit actually penetrates something, and takes him out all the way.  He absolutely deserved that, but the real telling part is that he himself can't even believe that it happened... because it's that unlikely to get punished for completely ignoring SPGs, even when you know an autoloading SPG is aiming right at you.  He either died because he's fucking stupid, or because he fully expects SPGs to be worthless. Either way, it wasn't ""because cancer"".  Your down votes just make you look like children."

WorldofTanks,3dks73,SilasTheVirous,6,Fri Jul 17 04:55:42 2015 UTC,try getting shit on by a T92 on the start of the game in your T8 med on himmelsdorf so you have 40 Hp remaining

WorldofTanks,3dks73,SilasTheVirous,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:42:50 2015 UTC,What pisses me off the most is when arty targets me over say the full HP higher tier french tank next to me. Fuck that shit.
WorldofTanks,3dks73,meeorxmox,2,Fri Jul 17 10:48:56 2015 UTC,"My 2.5 cents.    Sometimes it's better to disengage, break contact and then re-engage. And it looks like there is only one arty on the enemy team. So he/she is going to look for a different target if they loose contact with you. Although if you are lower tier tank or a squishy tank then they might hang around to see if you pop up again. The middle was open, LTs should have scouted out the arty, then your arty (if he's any good and in range) will immediately blow that arty away.  Number one target for arty should be the enemy arty.  OR LTs should have kicked it's ass.  Hiding behind hills and buildings is your best bet. Depending on the arty, many of them fire with a pretty flat arc, so they can't hit guys hiding in the ""shadow"" of hills, mountains, buildings. Given the direction of the shots coming in, good protection might be where that heavy in front of him was. I know some arty have very high arc so even that may not help. If I was that tanker I would have made for the hill cover or the building.  Then try to reacquire targets from that spot. I can't really tell what type of arty is firing other than it's a Tier X.  So unless you are up against the French auto loader, then you have 35-80 secs to move before the next shot comes in.    Arty is incredibly vulnerable to attack. They are glass cannons for the most part.  You want to stop the rain of shells, that's when you need a good LT driver that is willing to go find them, and not just hide behind the heavies taking pot shots. You have the tools to remove the threat.  And hell, if they have arty then you do as well, which means your LT doesn't even need to attack the arty, just spot the dam thing."
WorldofTanks,3dks73,FrostFire626,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:09:29 2015 UTC,"Sure but most times that comes at the cost of impact full play.    You seriously expect scouts to scout and yolo rush arty?  Scouting is hardly a relevant thing in pubs, even for LTs. Your basically saying you should depend on your team to combat arty -- which is utter bullshit. Most decent positions and many maps in there near entirety are not arty safe. No their arcs are not that flat actually; it's not like WG takes arcs into consideration when they decide the height of hills. There is often multiple enemy arty in multiple positions which have the cumulative lines of fire to keep you targeted almost anywhere; let alone anywhere where a player could perform. OK if you want to forgo impact on the game and camp. This game would be better without multiple invisible untouchable orbital death cannons in every match; we could play the game and apply skill more than before due to increased aggressiveness in game-play.   The fuck does that matter? It doesn't matter at all, the entire class concept is broken as all fuck.     The fuck are you talking about?? Arty is fucking untouchable except to a very lucky yolo scout or lucky counter battery. Once again scouts don't do shit, scouting is hardly relevant and even if they tried most LT drivers are incompetent (like most of the player base). Very few LT drivers will take high risks for the low reward on their personal part."

They're part of the game whether you like them or not.     is being punished by some skycancer shitter sitting in his base firing over mountains at him without retaliation.     No part of this sentence is a sensible or accurate portrayal of the situation.  The guy in the video knows he is spotted and that the enemy has artillery but instead of using some of the nearby hard cover, he proceeds to sit in the open for long enough that the enemy SPG has time to aim in on him and fire.  Then, even though he knows an autoloading artillery piece is discharging its drum at him, he stays put and lets it hit him two more times.  At no point does he take steps to avoid being targeted or hit by artillery.  He's simply an idiot who got himself killed and who'd rather blame everyone's favourite whipping boy than take responsibility for his own mistakes."

All my arguments are based around the fact that arty never should have been added to a game about tank vs tank combat.

If the guy in the video had been safe from arty, he would have been just that...not shooting enemy tanks, not contributing to winning. Just being forced to camp. And of course in his situation even if he had moved around more he still would have lost 75% of his HP to, once again, someone sitting inside their base, firing over cover, without retaliation, without any knowledge of tactics, or angling, or weakspots, or anything but just clicking (see what point im trying to make here?)

WorldofTanks,3dks73,Graybie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:49:52 2015 UTC,"artillery is not broken or op   And everything you say is now moot. There is literally no reason to argue with you if youre too blind to see how fucking wrong you are, just because you want to sit inside your base like a little bitch and ruin everyones day.  Also    artillery drivers need to know about everything other players do   Holy shit if you believe that then i think you actually have a mental disability. If you come up against an enemy tank in a real tank, you have to take into consideration your armor, their armor, whether you can take a shot, whether theyre reloading, whether they have shots left in their clip, and tons of more stuff that presents itself when youre fighting. In artillery (and i have an S-51), you literally spawn in, back up to your camping spot, open up yout fucking satellite view, and click. There is no tactics, no risk, no fear, nothing. You literally sit inside the base, and fire over mountains, without any form of retaliation. (Oh ever heard that one before?)  No matter your opinion on skycancer, if you think a class being able to do what arty can do is not op/broken, then you are seriously misguided."

WorldofTanks,3dks73,Lossmysox,3,Fri Jul 17 15:03:33 2015 UTC,"We do count on being targets from the first minute. I guess you are saying that we should just hide behind a building or remain unspotted until arty is dead? If traveling at full speed and swerving around doesn't mean we stay safe, what is the right thing to do in your opinion? Should I sit in some bushes and camp? That is certainly much safer, and I will still get my damage and purple points, but it will be a boring game that my team will be much more likely to lose."
WorldofTanks,3dks73,IndignantBeaver,-4,Fri Jul 17 06:40:09 2015 UTC,"Of course you wont stay safe swewing around. Arty shells usually took 3 seconds to reach the target, just a slight left or right turn movement can be a difference between a yellow track splash damage and getting 1k to the side! What you should do is every time count on being shot by arty and moving accordingly even if you are in a heavy tank. Arty players dont like targets that are not stationary. You are most vulnerable when you stop to aim on an enemy tank. The fellow in the video beautifully demonstrated that. Thats when you have to bait the arty to shoot you and you just go reverse steering left or right waching the shell miss you. Than you have a 40-45 second window to work with and deal with the opositon. I never camp, and i never had the patience to camp, camping is not an accepted solution. I see a lot of retarded players camp behind rocks after getting hit by arty in a 2v5 situation when that 45 second intval is more than enough to steamroll that two tanks. But nooo, they wait for the arty to reload and thats how you get theese absurd situations. You know the saying "" People fear what they dont understand."" And i see a lot of people here fear the arty because of that."
WorldofTanks,3dks73,Ry0K3N,-7,Fri Jul 17 07:01:32 2015 UTC,And you know what is the best part about the video?

Your logic is just flawless. Absolutely flawless. Next time please dont even start wot, do humanity a favor. And keep yourself away from it."
WorldofTanks,3dks73,Piecejr,3,Fri Jul 17 07:54:25 2015 UTC,"You're getting pretty buttmad over this.    Next time please dont even start wot, do humanity a favor. And keep yourself away from it.   Are you fucking kidding me?  An E5 with an ~18 second reload is fucking useless beyond belief. It's an E100 with neither alpha nor the armor/HP.   And because of the position on the map, the Autoloading skycancer could just keep him in place because it's balanced.  Have you ever even played WoT to tier 10? Or is your head just so far up your ass that you're delusional to how the game mechanics work?"
WorldofTanks,3dks73,Ry0K3N,0,Fri Jul 17 09:51:03 2015 UTC,It's not useless. Any active gun in the game is useful. You'd have to play different. Keep your space. But the gun on the E5 is amazing and accurate. Definitely not useless.
WorldofTanks,3dks73,my_name_is_Rok,-1,Fri Jul 17 10:05:59 2015 UTC,You are just simply too stupid and incompetent to argue with.  by your logic: Being dead > being ammoracked with a HP pool  Come back when you learned the basics of World of Tanks but dont spread your bullshit please anymore.
WorldofTanks,3dks73,seVan80,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:08:54 2015 UTC,Thanks for answering my last question.
WorldofTanks,3dks73,Piecejr,7,Fri Jul 17 16:19:17 2015 UTC,"How about you stop pretending like its that easy to avoid arty? Arty is the most RNG mechanic in the game, and even in a mobile heavy like the E5 its impossible to move out of the splash range of an arty fast enough anyways."
WorldofTanks,3dnb9t,xXL1ghtSk0p3zXx,2,Fri Jul 17 17:43:00 2015 UTC,"Hello warriors,  in last few weeks, World of Tanks Xbox introduced a whole bunch of new perks. I wonder if these will appear in World of Tanks. Examples:  Muffled Shot (Perk): decreases the effect of firing on your vehicle's camouflage factor Track Mechanic (Perk): the driver is able to repair tracks faster Paratrooper Training (Perk): enables your driver to reduce the overall falling damage Silent Driving (Skill): decreases the effect that movement has on your vehicle's camouflage factor. Silent Driving   is less effective the higher your vehicle's standard moving camouflage factor is Green Thumb (Perk): increases your vehicle's camouflage factor while hidden in or behind foliage Pain Tolerance (Skill): reduces the chance of critical damage to your crew Swimming Lessons (Perk): increases the amount of time your vehicle can survive underwater"
WorldofTanks,3dnb9t,rriffrraff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:44:50 2015 UTC,"Now if you could take the Swimming lessons perk and add a  periscope and snorkel from the imaginary equipment , and drive the whole length of the rive on Erlenberg and stay submerged while you cap during an Encounter battle."

WorldofTanks,3dm44e,Cmdr_Oddball,2,Fri Jul 17 14:07:49 2015 UTC,Wow that german mission.
WorldofTanks,3dm44e,CdnUkr,2,Fri Jul 17 14:12:34 2015 UTC,"I was really, really hoping for camo and/or crew training to go on discount this weekend. It has been a while since they have if I remember correctly."
WorldofTanks,3dm44e,windhover,2,Fri Jul 17 15:05:11 2015 UTC,Camo was on sale 2 or so weeks ago. I'm guessing there's going to be massive sales in about 2 weeks for WG birthday
WorldofTanks,3dm44e,AthasDuneWalker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:27:32 2015 UTC,Goodwood?  I'm totally screwed this weekend.
WorldofTanks,3dm44e,boucem,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:30:49 2015 UTC,I bought a Cromwell literally minutes before they went on sale...  XD
WorldofTanks,3dm44e,pirategolf13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:46:10 2015 UTC,Pretty typical weekend event
WorldofTanks,3dm44e,thespichopat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:46:49 2015 UTC,"Ugh. Why do the discounts always stop at tier 7. I guess they need to keep the ""On Tracks"" special."
WorldofTanks,3dm44e,theDumb12,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:34:58 2015 UTC,EU events got so boring and repetitive that they don't even name them anymore. It's just weekend specials nowadays.
WorldofTanks,3dm44e,Whipstock,0,Fri Jul 17 15:47:08 2015 UTC,American event and tank sale? Yep  British event and tank sale? Yep  Major French historical event? Flag  Yay
WorldofTanks,3dm44e,theDumb12,2,Fri Jul 17 15:13:56 2015 UTC,I still think they should have poked fun and had a plain white flag for the french event.
