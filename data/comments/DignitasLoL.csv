DignitasLoL,3drvfb,KareemAshraf98,4,Sat Jul 18 21:23:59 2015 UTC,"This thread is a thorough spit in DIG's face. We are in playoffs and contention for the number 1 seed for world's why are we rooting that we place higher than some teams when we can be rooting for the best outcome possible? You don't think our boys can make it through playoffs? Then why even root for them to get into 2nd place, or by what you mean a chance for 2nd place."
DignitasLoL,3drvfb,KingDozer,2,Sun Jul 19 04:10:51 2015 UTC,"I just recently learned about this subreddit. Been a dig fan for 3 years now, just felt like sharing some concerns with fellow diggans. Being concerned about a realistic possibility that wasn't all that probable a few weeks ago isnt a spit in DIG's face. Just wanted to see what people had to say bout are chances. There's nothing wrong with looking at worse case scenarios for getting to worlds, since there are definitely more than 3 good teams in NA. Not sure why you're so mad."
DignitasLoL,3drvfb,KingDozer,2,Sun Jul 19 04:36:28 2015 UTC,"I get super pissed when I see someone claiming to be a DIG fan and only giving them a bit of credit for what they can accomplish. I'm not sorry for what I said, if you wanted to talk about chances talk about playoffs. I just don't understand why DIG can't have more supportive fans, the die hard ones that truly believe they can't lose. I see more and more of ""there's no way we can do that"" ""why haven't we benched x player"" and so on. It makes me wonder about everyone who claims to be a DIG fan."
DignitasLoL,3drvfb,CharzarII,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:33:41 2015 UTC,"We'll agree to disagree. I just think there's nothing wrong with being realistic or talking about our chances on the big stage. DIG's games are like the few things in my life that I actually care about personally and get mad, happy, excited, or scared over. If you think that because I'm not a ""WERE FUKIN INVINCIBLE WE CANT LOSE""  fan that I'm not one at all, I disagree. Sorry if I may have insulted you or our team. Donger out."
DignitasLoL,3dbdhp,smugtronix,2,Tue Jul 14 23:24:09 2015 UTC,"Thats bad, rico was a good coach BS well.......i dont remember the last good thing that he have done good in this game.  My fear is that we will soon be back at the same level of last split, with brokenshard as new milixya."
DignitasLoL,3dbdhp,unfoit,2,Wed Jul 15 04:52:19 2015 UTC,"First of all, he is coaching DIG EU who are first in the CS. He coached H2K with prolly for a while. and finally, he is not meant to stay. When Rico deals with his problems he will be back.  Also, according to that article Rico is still coaching over the internet, Brokenshard is here to help with p/b."

DignitasLoL,3d7mz7,Kdog_123,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:44:05 2015 UTC,"IMO they need to be as decisive as they were in the games they won.  I don't understand why all of a sudden the p/b phase seems to be bad for everyone, I think the problem is execution. As far as I know Rico had to go home and should be back any moment now.  My thoughts for every player: Gamsu has been playing well but he is not receiving much attention from Helios.  Helios tried so hard to gank bot he forgot everything else in the map.  Shiphtur has been playing well.  CoreJJ seemed to be scared of farming in the game against C9 and I don't understand why.  Kiwi needs to concentrate a little bit more.  Next week we play against Gravity who are currently first and playing extremely well. They have been prioritizing Maokai for Hauntzer and Shen for Bunnyfufu. The problem is they have a large champion pool so it's hard to ban them out.  On sunday we play against TSM who have also lost their 2 games this week. I think we have a better shot here than against Gravity.  With hard work and concentration they can get a 2-0 week, I believe in them. There are few games left in the split and we need to secure the playoff spot even though it's almost impossible to lose it by now."

DignitasLoL,3d7mz7,Demelian,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:17:45 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree about Shiphtur playing well.  He was during Dig's rise to No. 1, but not during this slump he hasn't.  He's been fine in terms of going pretty even in his lane, but he's routinely been less of a factor than his opposing midlaner.  And againt Team Impulse, for instance, literally EVERY TIME XWX made a teleport play, Shiphtur waffled back and forth between trying to follow or just pushing the lane.  He ended up getting nothing accomplished every time.  You're right that this comes back to being decisive.  Shiphtur has been just as guilty of indecisiveness as everyone else on the team, in my opinion.  But I'm not trying to say he's a shitty player or anything. The whole team has been struggling the past few games. I'm a big fan of Shiphtur's.  I just want so badly to see him return to being a decisive playmaker like he was way back in the day on Coast."
DignitasLoL,3d7mz7,WhyghtChaulk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:25:13 2015 UTC,"It's the same as every year. They overperform for the first half of the split, people start hyping them, and they revert back t the same old Dig they have always been."
DignitasLoL,3d7mz7,Antigonus1i,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:46:27 2015 UTC,"DIG's pick/ban without Rico have been questionable. One example is the early Sivir pick against C9, when C9 had already locked in Kalista.  Helios I feel has been wasting time in the early game. In trying to get pressure,he stays in lanes, waiting for a gank that's near impossible to pull off.   Once we get Rico back, I feel like we have a fighting chance. Remember that we only need to win 1 game to clinch our playoff spot, OR C9 and NME go anything other than 4-0.   ༼ つ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ༽つ GIVE DIG OUR ENERGY BOYS, WE GOT THIS ༼ つ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ༽つ"
DignitasLoL,3d7mz7,smugtronix,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:36:01 2015 UTC,"But where's Rico at in the first place? If he has family, health, personal, whatever issues, just throw out a tweet via the org's twitter and everything is okay.   I'm really worried what's going on."
DignitasLoL,3d7mz7,DrJackl3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:56:30 2015 UTC,"The dig organization announced that Rico has personal issues and had to fly back to France, but is still working remotely. Brokenshard (currently works with the EU Challenger team) is the replacement until Rico comes back."

DignitasLoL,3ckif6,4everAPwn,4,Wed Jul 8 16:55:57 2015 UTC,"With Dig EU looking so good, I'm beginning to wonder if ODEE will consider selling the NA team when DEU gets promoted.  God I hate Riot's rules about not owning multiple teams."
