The symbolism feels deep, and it's overall a good episode. The feeling of knowing really drives it home, and how Nagato acts accordingly makes it richer.  The phone call between Nagato and Kyon, nailed the scene as one of the best in the entire anime.  To put the icing and the cherry onto the $1 cake which tastes like a cake which costs $1 million, the acoustic-ish version of the ending song just made it all that better. Hell, I'm currently repeating it, and I am going to be very angry if they don't release it as a single."

The first half was pretty good, it's nice to have a dose of Haruhi and she was represented well in this universe, though the second half descended into ""we're doing a SoL take on the tMoHS storyline"" and ended pretty much as an episode of tMoHS rather than the separate spin-off that has been building so far.   Personally, I'm hoping the next episode or two puts the limelight back on our MC and Best Girl while trying to pull away from Haruhi's overpowering character without completely sidelining her. Haruhi is a great character in small amounts but can quickly get out of control and end up being the focus of the show if things continue."

Nagato,326fza,Racecar_Driver,2,Sat Apr 11 01:34:47 2015 UTC,i understand dat hype  Also...
Nagato,326fza,Racecar_Driver,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:36:20 2015 UTC,Also who is that weird man. They say he is Kyon but he looks nothing like Kyon.
Nagato,326fza,Hatsus,2,Sat Apr 11 01:41:00 2015 UTC,"It's Kyon, just that it's in the style of the manga."
Nagato,326fza,AHxCode,2,Sat Apr 11 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"I know it doesn't fit the manga style, but I wish Kyon would remain straightfaced with his dry, sarcastic sense of humor instead of trying to be moe. Kyon can't be moe."

Nagato,31hb9x,otakuman,1 point,Sun Apr 5 02:02:16 2015 UTC,"After looking at that list, those books are all over the place in terms of genre. I'm surprised to see stuff like Crowley on there.  And now I want to buy a bunch more books even though I'm waiting for a couple new video games. I don't need savings anyway."
Nagato,31hb9x,DarkStar5758,1 point,Sun Apr 5 07:44:01 2015 UTC,"Damn you, procrastination!"
